THE SKY PILOT IN NO MANS LAND



CHAPTER I

ONLY A MISSIONARY


High upon a rock poised like a bird for flight stark naked his satin
skin shining like gold and silver in the rising sun stood a youth
tall slim of body not fully developed but with muscles promising in
their faultless gently swelling outline strength and suppleness to an
unusual degree Gazing down into the pool formed by an eddy of the river
twenty feet below him he stood as if calculating the distance his
profile turned toward the man who had just emerged from the bushes and
was standing on the sandy strand of the river paddle in hand looking
up at him with an expression of wonder and delight in his eyes

Ye gods what a picture said the man to himself

Noiselessly as if fearing to send the youth off in flight he laid his
paddle on the sand hurriedly felt in his pockets and swore to himself
vigorously when he could find no sketch book there

What a pose What an Apollo he muttered

The sunlight glistening on the beautiful white skin lay like pools of
gold in the curving hollows of the perfectly modelled body and ran like
silver over the rounded swellings of the limbs Instinct with life he
seemed something in his pose suggesting that he had either alighted
from the golden ambient air or was about to commit himself to it The
man on the sand continued to gaze as if he were beholding a creature of
another world

Oh Lord What lines he breathed

Slowly the youth began to move his arms up to the horizontal then to
the perpendicular reaching to the utmost of his height upon his toe
tips breathing deep the while Smoothly slowly the muscles in legs
and thighs in back in abdomen in chest responding to the exercise
moved under the lustrous skin as if themselves were living things Over
and over again the action was repeated the muscles and body moving in
rhythmic harmony like some perfect mechanism running in a bath of oil

Ye gods of Greece breathed the man What is this thing I see Flesh
or spirit Man or god Again he swore at himself for neglecting to
bring his sketch book and pencil

Hello father Where are you A girls voice rang out high clear
and near at hand

Good Lord said the man to himself glancing up at the poised figure
I must stop her

One startled glance the youth flung down upon him another in the
direction of the voice then like a white gleaming arrow he shot down
and disappeared in the dark pool below

With his eyes upon the water the man awaited his reappearing A half
minute a full minute he waited but in vain Swiftly he ran toward the
edge of the pool There was no sign anywhere of the youth

Ghastly pale and panting the man ran as far round the base of the rock
as the water would allow him seeking everywhere signs of the swimmer

Hello father Oh there you are Breaking through the bushes a girl
ran to him

What is it pater You are ill What is the matter

Good heavens he was there gasped the man pointing to the high rock
He plunged in there He pointed to the pool He hasnt come up He is
drowned

Who What are you saying Wake up father Who was there

A boy A young man He disappeared down there

A young man Was hewas hedressed inquired the girl

Dressed No No

Did hedid hehear mecalling

Of course he did Thats what startled him I imagine Poor boy I fear
he is gone

Did he fall in or did he dive

He seemed to dive but he has not come up I fear he is gone

Oh nonsense father said the girl I bet you he has swum round the
bend Just go over the rock and see

God grant it said her father

He dropped his paddle ran up over the rock and down into the little
dell on the other side that ran down to the waters edge There he saw
a tent with all the accompaniments of a well ordered camp and a man
cooking breakfast on a small fire

Well Ill be combusticated he said to himself weakly holding to a
little poplar tree

I say he cried where is he Has he come in Is he all right

Who said the man at the fire

The boy on the rock

The man gazed at him astonished then as if suddenly grasping his
meaning replied

Yes he came in Hes dressing in the tent

Well Ill be condumbusticated said the man Say what the devil
does he mean by scaring people out of their senses in that way

The man at the fire stood gazing at him in an utterly bewildered way

If you will tell me exactly what you are after I may be able to help
you

The other drew slowly near the fire He was still pale and breathing
quickly

Hello dad is breakfast ready came a cheery voice from the tent

Thank God he is alive apparently said the man sinking down on a log
beside the fire You must pardon me sir he said You see I saw
him take a header into the pool from that high rock over yonder and he
never came up again I thought he was drowned

The man at the fire smiled

The young villain gave you a fright did he One of his usual tricks
Well as his father and more or less responsible for him I offer the
most humble apology Have you had breakfast

Yes But why did he do such a thing

Ask him Here he comes

Out from the tent came the youth in shorts the warm glow of his body
showing through the filmy material

Hello he cried backing toward the tent door You are the man with
the paddle Is there by any chance a lady with you or did I hear a
ladys voice over there I assure you I got a deuce of a fright

You gave me the supreme fright of my life young man I can tell you
that

But I surely heard a ladys voice said the youth

You did It was my daughters voice and it was she who suggested that
you had swum around the bend And she sent me over here to investigate

Oh your daughter Excuse me said the youth I shall be out in a few
minutes He slid into the tent and did not reappear

The man remained chatting with the youths father for a few minutes
then rising said

Well I feel better I confess this thing gave me something of a shock
But come round and see us before we go We shall be leaving in an hour

The man at the fire promised to make the visit and the other took his
departure

A few minutes later the youth reappeared

Is breakfast ready he cried My but Im hungry But who is he
dad

Sit down said his father and get your breakfast while it is hot

But who is he dad persisted the youth

Who is he said his father dishing up the bacon An oil explorer
an artist a capitalist an American from Pittsburgh the father of one
child a girl Her mother is dead Nineteen years old athletic modern
type college bred boss of the show quotation These are a few of
the facts volunteered within the limited space of his visit

Whats he like dad

Like Like an American

Now dad dont allow your old British prejudices to run away with your
judgment

On the contrary I am perfectly charmed He is one of those Americans
who capture you at once educated frank open with that peculiar charm
that Britishers will not be able to develop for many generations An
American but not of the unspeakable type Not at all You will like
him

I am sure I shall replied the youth I liked his voice and his face
I like the Americans I met such nice chaps at college So clever and
with such a vocabulary

Vocabulary Well Im not too sure as to the vocabulary part of it

Yes such bright pat expressive slang so fresh and in such variety
So different from your heavy British slang in which everything
approaching the superlative must be one of three things ripping with
very distinct articulation on the double p or top hole or awfully
jolly More recently I believe a fourth variation is allowed in
priceless

Ah my boy you have unconsciously uttered a most searching criticism
on your American friends Dont you know that a vocabulary rich in slang
is poverty stricken in forceful and well chosen English The wealth of
the one is the poverty of the other

Where is he going enquired the boy

Out by way of Edmonton Calgary Moose Jaw Minneapolis so on to
Pittsburgh Partner with him young lawyer expert in mines unmarried
He is coming back in a couple of months or so for a big hunt Wants us
to join him Really extraordinary when you come to think of it how
much information he was able to convey in such a short space of time
Marvellous gift of expression

What did you say dad

Say Oh as to his invitation Why I believe I accepted my boy It
seemed as if I could do nothing else Its a way he has

Isis the daughter to be along

Let me see What did he say Really I dont know But I should judge
that it would be entirely as she wished She is

Boss of the show eh

Exactly Most vivid phrase eh

Very And no doubt aptly descriptive of the fact

In half an hour the breakfast was finished and the elder man got his
pipe agoing

Now dad you had better go along and make your call while I get
things together here

What You not going No no that wont do my boy It was about you
they were concerned You were the occasion of the acquaintanceship
Besides meeting in the wilderness this way we cant do that sort of
thing you know

Well dad frankly I am quite terrified of the young lady Suppose she
should start bossing us We should both be quite helpless

Oh nonsense boy Come along Get your hat

All right Ill come On your head be the consequences dad No I
dont need a hat Fortunately I put on a clean shirt Will I do dad
You know Im scairt stiff as Harry Hobbs would say

His father looked him over but there was nothing critical in his
glance Pride and love filled his eyes as they ran over his sons face
and figure And small wonder The youth was good to look upon A shade
under six feet he stood straight and slim strength and supple grace
in every move of his body His face was beautiful with the beauty of
features clean cut and strong but more with the beauty of a clear
candid soul He seemed to radiate an atmosphere of cheery good nature
and unspoiled simplicity He was two years past his majority yet
he carried the air of a youth of eighteen in which shyness and
fearlessness looked out from his deep blue eyes It was well that he
wore no hat to hide the mass of rich brown hair that waved back from his
forehead

Youll do boy said his father in a voice whose rigid evenness of
tone revealed the emotion it sought to conceal Youll take all the
shine from me you young beggar he added in a tone of gruff banter
but there was a time

WAS a time dad IS and dont tell me you dont know it I always feel
like a school kid in any company when youre about


 When the sun comes out
 All the little stars run in


he sang from a late music hall effusion Why just come here and look
at yourself and the boys eyes dwelt with affectionate pride upon his
father

It was easy to see where the boy got his perfect form Not so tall as
his son he was more firmly knit and with a kind of dainty neatness in
his appearance which suggested the beau in earlier days But there
was nothing of weakness about the erect trim figure A second glance
discovered a depth of chest a thickness of shoulder and of thigh and
a general development of muscle such as a ring champion might show and
indeed it was his achievements in the ring rather than in the class
lists that won for Dick Dunbar in his college days his highest fame And
though his fifty years had slowed somewhat the speed of foot and hand
the eye was as sure as ever and but little of the natural force was
abated which once had made him the glory of the Cambridge sporting
youth and which even yet could test his sons mettle in a fast bout

On the sandy shore of the river below the eddy they found the American
and his party gathered with their stuff ranged about them ready for the
canoes

Ah here you are sir said the American advancing hat in hand And
this is your son the young rascal who came mighty near giving me heart
failure this morning By the way I havent the pleasure of knowing your
name

My name is Richard Dunbar and this is my son Barry

My name is Osborne Howland of Pittsburgh and this is my daughter
Paula In bloomers as you see but nevertheless my daughter Meet also
my friend and partner Mr Cornwall Brand

The party exchanged greetings and spent some moments giving utterance
to those platitudes which are so useful in such circumstances a sort of
mental marking time preparatory to further mutual acquaintance

The girl possessed that striking dashing kind of brunette beauty that
goes with good health good living and abundance of outdoor exercise
She carried herself with that air of assured selfconfidence that comes
as the result of a somewhat wide experience of men women and things
She quite evidently scorned the conventions as her garb being quite
masculine her speech being outspoken and decorated with the newest and
most ingenious slang her whole manner being frankly impulsive loudly
proclaimed

But Barry liked her at once and made no pretence of concealing his
liking To her father also he was immediately drawn As to Cornwall
Brand between whom and the girl there seemed to exist a sort of
understanding he was not so sure

For half an hour or so they stood by the river exchanging their
experiences in these northern wilds and their views upon life in the
wilderness and upon things in general By a little skilful managing
the girl got the young man away from the others and then proceeded to
dissect and classify him

Through the open woods along the river bank they wandered pausing here
and there to admire the view until they came to an overhanging bank at
the entrance to a somewhat deep gorge through which the river foamed to
the boiling rapids below It was indeed a beautiful scene The banks
of the river were covered with every variety of shrub and tree except
where the black rocks broke through between the banks the dark river
raged and fretted itself into a foam against its rocky barriers over
them arched the sky a perfect blue

What a lovely view exclaimed the girl seating herself upon the edge
of the bank Now she said tell me about yourself You gave my pater
a fearful fright this morning He was quite paralysed when I came on
him

I am very sorry said the youth but I had no intention

I know I told him not to worry replied the girl I knew you would
be all right

And how pray said the young man blushing at the memory of his
startling appearance upon that rock

I knew that any fellow who could take that dive wouldnt likely let
himself drown I guessed too that if you heard me hoot

I did said the youth

You sure would get slippy right away

I did

I guess you were pretty well startled yourself werent you said the
girl pursuing the subject with cool persistence

Rather said the young man blushing more violently and wishing she
would change the subject You are going out he enquired

Yes

Today

Nowright away

Too bad he said his disappointment evident in his tone

When are you going out But who are you anyway asked the girl You
have to tell me that

My life story so to speak

She nodded

Its very short and simple like the annals of the poor he replied
From England in infancy on a ranch in northern Alberta for ten years
a puny little wretch I was terribly bothered with asthma thenthe
boy hesitated a momentmy mother died father moved to Edmonton lived
there for five years thence to Wapiti away northwest of Edmonton our
present home prepared for college by my father university course in
Winnipeg graduated in theology a year ago now the missionary in charge
of Wapiti and the surrounding district

A preacher said the girl her face and her tone showing her
disappointment only too plainly

Not much of a preacher I fear said the young man with a smile A
missionary rather Thats my story

She noticed with some chagrin that he did not ask for hers

What are you doing here she enquired

He hesitated a moment or two

Dad and I always take a trip into the wilds every summer Then he
added after a few moments pause But of course we have other business
on hand up here

Business Up here

Yes Dad has some He made as if to continue but changed his mind and
fell into silence leaving her piqued by his reserve and by his apparent
indifference to the things concerning herself She did not know that he
was eagerly hoping that she would supply this information

At length he ventured Must you go away today

I dont suppose theres any must about it

Why not stay

Why should I

Oh it would be jolly he cried You see we couldexplore about
hereandhe ended rather lamelyits a lovely country

Weve seen a lot of it It IS lovely she said her eyes upon his face
as if appraising him I should like to know you better she added
with sudden and characteristic frankness so I think we will stay But
you will have to be awfully good to me

Why of course he cried Thats splendid Perfectly jolly

Then we had better find father and tell him Come along she ordered
and led the way back to the camp

The young man followed her wondering at her and giving slight heed
to the chatter she flung over her shoulder at him as she strode along
through the bushes

Whats the matter with you she cried facing round upon him You
were thinking about me I know Confess now

I was he acknowledged smiling at her

What were you thinking Tell me she insisted

I was thinking He paused

Go on she cried

I was thinking of what your father said about you

My father About me What did he say To you

No To dad

What was it Tell me I must know She was very imperious in her
manner The youth only smiled at her

Go on she said impatiently

I think possibly your father was right he replied when he said you
boss the show

Oh thats what he said eh Well I guess hes about right

But you dont really

Dont what Boss the show Well I boss my own show at any rate
Dont you

Dont I what exactly Boss the show Well I dont think we have any
show and I dont believe we have any boss Dad and I just talk
things over you see

But she insisted some one in the last analysis must decide Your
menage no matter how simple must have a head It is a law of the
universe itself and it is the law of mankind You see I have done some
political economy

And yet said the young man you say you run your own show

Exactly Every social organism must have a head but every individual
in the organism must live its own free life That is true democracy But
of course you dont understand democracy you Canadians

Aha There you are You Americans are the most insular of all the great
peoples of the world You know nothing of other people You know only
your own history and not even that correctly your own geography and
your own political science You know nothing of Canada You dont
know for instance that the purest form of democracy on this American
continent lies outside the bounds of the U S A

In Canada she asked scornfully By the way how many Canadians are
there

Yes I know We are a small people he said quietly but no more real
democracy exists anywhere in the world than in this country of mine We
are a small people but he said with a sweep of his hand toward the
west and the north the future is with us The day is coming when
along this waterway great cities shall be with factories and humming
industries These plains these flowing hills will be the home of
millions of men and in my lifetime too

His eyes began to glow his face to shine with a rare and fascinating
beauty

Do you know the statistics of your country Do you know that during the
last twenty years the rate of Canadas growth was three times greater
than ever in the history of the United States You are a great
commercial nation but do you know that the per capita rate of Canadas
trade today is many times that of the United States You are a great
agricultural people but do you know that threequarters of the wheat
land on this continent is Canadian and that before many years you will
be coming to Canada for your wheat yes and for your flour Do you see
that river Do you know that Canada is the richest country in the world
in water power And more than that in the things essential to national
greatnessnot these things that you can see these material things
he said sweeping his hand contemptuously toward the horizon but in
such things as educational standards in administration of justice
in the customs of a liberty loving people in religious privileges in
everything that goes to make character and morale Canada has already
laid the foundations of a great nation

He stopped short abashed the glow fading from his face the light from
his eyes

Forgive me he said with a little laugh I am a first class ass
I fear I was blowing like a fog horn But when you touch Canada you
release something in me

While he was speaking her eyes never left his face Go on she said
in a voice of suppressed emotion go on I love to hear you

Her wonted poise was gone she was obviously stirred with deep emotion

Go on she commanded laying her hand upon his arm Dont stop Tell
me more aboutabout Canada about anything she added impatiently

A warm eager light filled her eyes She was biting her lips to still
their tremor

Theres plenty to tell about Canada he said but not now What
started me Oh democracy Yes it was you that began it Democracy
After all it is worth while that the people who are one day to fill
this wide land should be truly democratic truly free and truly great

Once more the light began to burn in his eyes and in his face

Ah to have a hand in that

And you she said in a low voice you with all that in you are only
a preacher

A missionary he corrected

Well a missionary Only a missionary

Disappointment and scorn were all too evident in her voice

ONLY a missionary Ah if I could only be one A missionary With a
mission and a message to my people If only I had the gift of tongues
of flaming burning illuminating speech of heartcompelling speech To
tell my people how to make this country truly great and truly free how
to keep it free from the sordid things the cruel things the unjust
the unclean the loathsome things that have debased and degraded the
older nations that are debasing and degrading even your young great
nation Ah to be a missionary with a tongue of fire with a message of
light A missionary to my people to help them to high and worthy living
to help them to God ONLY a missionary What would you have me A
moneymaker

He turned swiftly upon her a magnetic compelling personality From the
furious scorn in his voice and in his flaming face she visibly shrank
almost as if he had struck her

No she breathed Nothing else Only a missionary

Silent she stood as if still under the spell of his words her eyes
devouring his face

How your mother would have loved you would have been proud of you
she said in a low tone Isis there no one else toto rejoice in
you she asked shyly but eagerly

He laughed aloud Theres dad dear old dad

And no one else Still with shy eager eyes she held him

Oh heaps he cried still laughing

She smiled upon him a slightly uncertain smile and yet as if his
answer somehow satisfied her

Goodbye she said impulsively offering her hand

But you are not going Youre staying a few days he gasped

No were going Were going right away Goodbye she said I dont
want those others to see Goodbye Oh its been a wonderful morning
Andanda friend is a wonderful discovery

Her hand held his in a strong warm grasp but her eyes searched his
face as if seeking something she greatly desired

Goodbye I am sorry you are going he said simply I want to know
you better

Do you she cried with a sudden eagerness in her voice and manner
Then No You would be disappointed I am not of your world But you
shall see me again she added as if taking a new resolve We are
coming back on a big hunt and you and your father are to join us Wont
you

Dad said we should said the youth smiling at the remembrance

And you she said with a touch of impatience

If things can so arrange themselvesmy work I mean and dads

But do you want to Do you really want to she asked I wish I knew
I hate not to understand people You are hard to know I dont know you
But you will come

I think so said the young man Of course a fellows work comes
first you know

Work she cried Your work Oh your missionary work Oh yes yes I
should like to see you at it Come let us go

Mr Cornwall Brand they found in a fever of impatience He had the
trip scheduled to a time table and he hated to be forced to change his
plans His impatience showed itself in snappy commands and inquiries to
his Indian guides who however merely grunted replies They knew their
job and did it without command or advice and with complete indifference
to anything the white man might have to say To Paula the only change in
his manner was an excess of politeness

Her father however met her with remonstrances

Why Paula my dear you have kept us waiting

Whats the rush pater she enquired coolly

Why my dear we are already behind our schedule and you know Cornwall
hates that he said in a low voice

Cornwall said Paula in a loud voice of unmistakable ill temper
Does Cornwall run this outfit

My dear Paula again remonstrated her father

She turned to him impatiently with an angry word at her lips caught
upon Barrys face a look of surprise paused midway in her passion then
moved slowly toward him

Well she asked in an even cold voice what do you think about it
And anyway she dropped her voice so that none heard but himself why
should you halt me Who are you to give me pause this way

Only a missionary he answered in an equally low tone but with a
smile gentle almost wistful on his face

As with a flash the wrathful cloud vanished

A missionary she replied softly God knows I need one

You do he said emphatically and still he smiled

Come Paula called Cornwall Brand We are all waiting

Her face hardened at his words

Goodbye she said to Barry I am coming back again toto your
wonderful Canada

Of course you are said Barry heartily They all do

He went with her to the canoe steadied her as she took her place and
stood watching till the bend in the river shut them from view

Nice people said his father Very fine jolly girl

Yes isnt she replied his son

Handsome too said his father glancing keenly at him

Is she Yes I think so Yes indeed very he added as if pondering
the matter When do we move dad

A look of relief crossed the fathers face

This afternoon I think We have only a few days now We shall run up
Buffalo Creek into the Foothills for some trout It will be a little
stiff but you are fit enough now arent you Barry His voice was
tinged with anxiety

Fit for anything dad thanks to you

Not to me Barry To yourself largely

No said the boy throwing his arm round his fathers shoulder
thanks to you dear old dadand to God



CHAPTER II

ON THE RED PINE TRAIL


On the Red Pine trail two men were driving in a buckboard drawn by a
pair of halfbroken pinto bronchos The outfit was a rather ramshackle
affair and the driver was like his outfit Stewart Duff was a rancher
once a remittance man but since his marriage three years ago he had
learned selfreliance and was disciplining himself in selfrestraint
A big lean man he was his thick shoulders and large hairy muscular
hands suggesting great physical strength his swarthy face heavy
features coarse black hair keen dark eyes deepset under shaggy
brows suggesting force of character with a possibility of brutality in
passion Yet when he smiled his heavy face was not unkindly indeed the
smile gave it a kind of rugged attractiveness He was past his first
youth and on his face were the marks of the stormy way by which he had
come

He drove his jibing bronchos with steady hands No light touch was his
upon the reins and the bronchos wild plunging met with a check
from those muscular hands of such iron rigidity as to fling them back
helpless and amazed upon their hocks

His companion was his opposite in physical appearance and in those
features and lines that so unmistakably reveal the nature and character
within Short and stout inclined indeed to fat to his great distress
his thickset figure indicated strength without agility solidity
without resilience He had a pleasant open face with a kindly
twinkling blue eye that goes with a merry heart with a genial sunny
soul But there was in the blue eye and in the open face for all the
twinkles and the smiles a certain alert shrewdness that proclaimed the
keen man of business and in the clean cut lips lay the suggestion of
resolute strength A likable man he was with an infinite capacity
for humour but with a bedrock of unyielding determination in him that
always surprised those who judged him lightly

The men were friends and had been comrades more or less during those
pioneer days that followed their arrival in the country from Scotland
some dozen years ago Often they had fallen out with each other for
Duff was stormy of temper and had a habit of letting himself swing out
upon its gusts of passion reckless of consequences but he was ever the
one to offer amends and to seek renewal of good relations He had few
friends and so he clung the more closely to those he had At such times
the other would wait in cool goodtempered but determined aloofness for
his friends return

You can chew your cud till youre cool again he would say when the
outbreak would arise But invariably their differences were composed and
their friendship remained unbroken

The men sat in the buckboard leaning forward with hunched shoulders
swaying easily to the pitching of the vehicle as it rattled along the
trail which especially where it passed over the round topped ridges
was thickly strewn with stones Before them now on the trail and now
ranging wide over the prairie ran a beautiful black and white English
setter

Great dog that Sandy said Duff I could have had a dozen birds this
afternoon A wonderful nose and steady as a rock

A good dog Stewart assented Sandy but with slight interest

There aint another like him in this western country said the owner
of the dog with emphasis

Oh I dont know about that There are some very good dogs around here
Stewart replied Sandy lightly

But I know And thats why Im saying there aint his like in this
western country and thats as true as your name is Sandy Bayne

Well my name is Sandy Bayne all right but how did he come out at the
Calgary trials

Aw those damned gawks They dont know a good dog from a hegoat They
dont know what a dog is for or how to use him

Oh now Stewart said Sandy I guess Willocks knows a dog when he
sees one

Willocks said his friend with scorn Theres where youre wrong Do
you know why he cut Slipper out of the Blue Ribbon Because he wouldnt
range a mile away Darned old fool Whats the good of a point a mile
away Keeps you running over the whole creation makes you lose time
tires yourself and tires your dog and more than that in nine cases out
of ten you lose your bird Give me a close ranger He cleans up as he
goes keeps your game right at your hand and gets you all the sport
there is

Who beat you Stewart in the trials

That bitch of Sniders

Man Stewart thats a beautiful bitch I know her well Shes a
beautiful bitch Sandy began to show enthusiasm

Oh there you go Thats just what those fool judges said Beautiful
dog Beautiful dog Suppose she is Looks aint everything Theyre
something but the question is does she get the birds Now Slipper
there got three birds to her one Got em within range too

Ah but Stewart yons a good bitch said Sandy

Look here cried his friend I have bred more dogs in the old country
than those men ever saw in their lives

That may be Stewart but yons a good bitch persisted Sandy

For a mile more they discussed the merits of Slipper and of his rivals
Sandy with his semihumorous chaff extracting quiet amusement from his
friends wrath and the latter though suspecting that he was being
drawn unable to restrain his passionate championship of his dog

At length Sandy wearying of the discussion caught sight of a figure
far before them on the trail

Who is that walking along there he enquired

Together they ran over the names of all who in this horse country were
unfortunate enough to be doomed to a pedestrian form of locomotion

Guess its the preacher said Duff finally whose eyes were like a
hawks

Hes been out at my place Sunday afternoon said Sandy but I havent
met him myself What sort is he

Dont ask me I sometimes go with the madame to church but generally I
fall asleep Hes no alarm clock

Then you cant tell what sort of a preacher he is said Sandy with a
twinkle in his eye You cant hear much when you are asleep

I hear enough to know that hes no good as a preacher I hear theyre
going to fire him

I tell you what it is Stewart said Sandy I dont believe you would
know a good sermon if you heard one

Whats that you say Ive heard the best preachers in the country that
breeds preachers in the country where preachers grow like the berries
on the bramble bushes I know preaching and I like good preaching
too

Oh come off Stewart You may be a good judge of dogs but Im blowed
if I am going to take you as a judge of preachers

The same qualities in all of them dogs horses preachers insisted
Duff

How do you make that out

Well take a horse He must be a goodlooker This preacher is a
goodlooker all right but looks aint everything Must be quick at the
start must have good action good style staying power and good at
the finish Most preachers never know when to finish and thats the way
with this man

Are you going to take him up inquired Sandy for they were now close
upon the man walking before them

Oh I guess not replied Duff I havent much use for him

Say whats the matter with him He looks rather puffed out said
Sandy Better take him up

All right replied Duff pulling up his bronchos Good day Will you
have a ride Mr Barry Dunbar my friend Mr Bayne

Glad to meet you Mr Bayne said Barry who was pale and panting
hard Thanks for the lift The truthisIm ratherdone up A touch
of asthmathe firstin five years An old trouble of mine

Get up here said Sandy Theres room for three in the seat

Nothank youI shouldcrowd youall right behind here Beastly
businessthis asthma Worse whenthe pollenfrom the plantsis
floatingaboutso they say I dont knownobody doesI fancy They
drove on bumping over the stones Barry gradually getting back his
wind The talk of the men in the front seat had fallen again on dogs
Stewart maintaining with ever increasing vehemence his expert knowledge
of dogs of hunting dogs and very especially of setter hunting dogs
his friend while granting his knowledge of dogs in general questioning
the unprejudiced nature of his judgment as far as Slipper was concerned

As Duffs declarations grew in violence they became more and more
elaborately decorated with profanity In the full tide of their
conversation a quiet voice broke in

Too many damns

What exclaimed Duff

I beg your pardon said Sandy

Too many damns said Barry looking quietly at Duff

Dams Where said Duff looking about

Beaver dams do you mean enquired Sandy I dont see any

Too many damns reiterated Barry You dont need them You really
dont need them you know and besides they are not right Profanity is
quite useless and its wicked

Well Ill be damned said Stewart in a low voice to his friend He
means us

And quite right too said Sandy solemnly You know your English is
rotten bad Yes sir he continued turning round to Barry I quite
agree with you My friend is quite unnecessarily free in his speech

Yes but you are just the same you know said Barry Not quite so
many but then you are not quite so excited

Got you there old sport grunted Duff highly amused at Sandys
discomfiture But to Barry he said I guess its our own business how
we express ourselves

Yes it is but pardon me not entirely so There are others in the
world you know and you must consider others The habit is a bad habit
a rotten habit and quite uselesssilly indeed

Duff turned his back upon him Sandy giving his friend a nudge burst
into a loud laugh

You are right sir he said turning to Barry You are quite right

At this point Slipper created a diversion

Hello said Duff Say Look at him He pointed to the dog Aint he
a picture

A hundred yards away stood Slipper rigid every muscle every hair
taut one foot arrested in air

Ill just get those said Duff slipping out of the buckboard and
drawing the gun from beneath the seat Steady old boy steady Hold
the lines Sandy

He moved quickly toward the dog who quivering with that mysterious
instinct found in the hunting dog still held the point with taut
muscles nose and tail in line

Hello Barry called out It isnt the season yet for chicken I say
Mr Duff he shouted it isnt the chicken season you know

Better leave him alone said Sandy

But it isnt the season yet It is against the law protested Barry
indignantly

Meantime Stewart Duff was closing up cautiously behind Slipper

Forward old boy Steeeady Forward The dog refused to move
Forward Slipper

Still the dog remained rigid as if nailed to the ground

On Slipper

Slowly the dog turned his head with infinite caution half round toward
his master as if in protest

Hello there shouted Barry you know

Just as he called there was on all sides a great whirring of wings A
dozen chicken flew up from under Duffs feet Bang Bang went his gun

Missed as Im a sinner exclaimed Sandy I thought he was a better
shot than that

Back came Duff striding wide toward the buckboard Fifty yards away he
shouted

Say what the devil do you mean calling like that at a man when hes on
the point of shooting His face was black with anger He looked ready
to strike Barry looked at him steadily

But I was just reminding you that it was not the season for chicken
yet he said in the tone of a man prepared to reason the matter

Whats that got to do with it And anyway whose business is it what I
do but my own

But its against the law

Oh blank the law Besides

Besides it isntwell you know it isnt quite sporting to shoot out
of season Barrys manner was as if dealing with a fractious child

Duff speechless with his passion looked at him as if not quite sure
what form his vengeance should take

Hes quite right Stewart said his friend Sandy who was hugely
enjoying himself You know well enough you are down on the farmer chaps
who go pot hunting before season Its rotten sport you know

Oh hell Will you shut up Cant I shoot over my dog when he points
Im not out shooting If I want to give my dog a little experience an
odd bird or two dont matter Besides what the

Oh come on Stewart Get in and get a move on You know you are in
the wrong But I thought you were a better shot than that added Sandy

His remark diverted Duffs rage

Better shot he stormed Who could shoot with aaa he was
feeling round helplessly for a properly effective wordwith a fellow
yelling at you he concluded lamely Id have had a brace of them if
it hadnt been for him

In that case said Barry coolly I saved you from the law

Saved me from the law What the devil do you mean anyway said
Stewart If I want to pick up a bird whos to hinder me And whats the
law got to do with it

Well you know Im not sure but it might have been my duty to report
you I feel that all who break the game laws should be reported It is
the only way to stop the lawless destruction of the game

Barry spoke in a voice of quiet deliberation as if pondering the proper
action in the premises

Quite right too said Sandy gravely but with a twinkle in his blue
eye They ought to be reported I have no use for those poachers

Duff made no reply His rage and disgust mingled with the sense of his
being in the wrong held him silent No man in the whole country was
harder upon the game poachers than he but to be held up in his action
and to be threatened with the law by this young preacher whom he rather
despised anyway seemed to paralyse his mental activities It did not
help his selfcontrol that he was aware that his friend was having his
fun of him

At this moment fortunately for the harmony of the party their
attention was arrested by the appearance of a motor car driven at a
furious rate along the trail and which almost before they were aware
came honking upon them With a wild lurch the bronchos hurled themselves
from the trail upsetting the buckboard and spilling its load

Duff cumbered with his gun which he had reloaded allowed one of
the reins to drop from his hands and the team went plunging about in a
circle but Barry the first to get to his feet rushed to the rescue
snatched the reins and held on till he had dragged the plunging bronchos
to a halt

The rage which had been boiling in Duff and which with difficulty had
been held within bounds suddenly burst all bonds of control With
a fierce oath he picked up the gun which he had thrown aside in his
struggle with the horses and levelled it at the speeding motor car

For Gods sake Stewart stop shouted Bayne springing toward his
friend

Barry was nearer and quicker The shot went off but his hand had
knocked up the gun

My God Stewart Are you clean crazy said Bayne gripping him by the
arm Do you know what you are doing You are not fit to carry a gun

Id have bust his blanked tires for him anyway blustered Duff
though his face and voice showed that he had received a shock

Yes and you might have been a murderer by this time and heading for
the pen but for Dunbar here You owe him more than you can ever pay
you blanked fool

Duff made no reply but busied himself with his horses Nor did he speak
again till everything was in readiness for the road

Get in he then said gruffly and that was his last word until they
drove into the village

At the store he drew up

Thank you for the lift said Barry I should have had a tough job to
get back in time

Duff grunted at him and passed on into the store

I am very glad to have met you said Bayne shaking hands warmly with
him You have done us both a great service He is my friend you know

I am afraid I have offended him all the same But you see I couldnt
help it could I

Bayne looked at his young earnest face for a moment or two as if
studying him then said with a curious smile No I dont believe you
could have helped it And with that he passed into the store

What sort of a chap is that preacher of yours he asked of the
storekeeper

I dont know he aint my church Ask Innes there Hes a pillar

Bayne turned to a long lean hardfaced man leaning against the
counter

My name is Bayne from Red Pine Mr Innes I am interested in knowing
what sort of a chap your preacher is He comes out to our section but I
never met him till today

Oh hes no that bad said Innes cautiously

Not worth a cent said a little red headed man standing near He
cant preach for sour apples

I wadna just say that Mr Hayes said Innes

How do you know Innes retorted Hayes You know you fall asleep
before he gets rightly started

I aye listen better with ma eyes shut

Yes and snore better too Mac said Hayes But I dont blame you
Most of them go to sleep anyway Thats the kind of preacher he is

What sort of a chap is he I mean what sort of man

Well for one thing hes always buttin in volunteered a
squarebuilt military looking man standing near If hed stick to
his gospel it wouldnt be so bad but hes always pokin his nose into
everything

But hes no that bad said Innes again and as for buttin in
McFettridge and preachin the gospel I doubt the country is a good
deal the better for the buttin in that him and his likes have done this
past year And besides the bairns all like him

Well thats not a bad sign Mr Innes said Sandy Bayne and Im not
sure that I dont like him myself But I guess he butts in all right

Oh ay he butts in agreed Innes but Im no so sure that thats no
a part of his job too



CHAPTER III

A QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE


The Dunbars lived in a cottage on a back street which had the
distinction of being the only home on the street which possessed the
adornment of a garden A unique garden it was too Indeed with the
single exception of Judge Hepburns garden which was quite an elaborate
affair and which was said to have cost the Judge a pile of money
there was none to compare with it in the village of Wapiti

Any garden on that bare windswept prairie meant toil and infinite
pains but a garden like that of the Dunbars represented in addition
something of genius In conception in design and in execution the
Dunbars garden was something apart Visitors were taken round to the
back street to get a glimpse of the Dunbars cottage and garden

The garden was in two sections That at the back of the cottage
sheltered by a high close board fence covered with Virginia creeper
was given over to vegetables and it was quite marvellous how under
Richard Dunbars care a quarter of an acre of ground could grow such
enormous quantities of vegetables of all kinds Next to the vegetable
garden came the plot for small fruitsstrawberries raspberries
currants of rare varieties

The front garden was devoted to flowers Here were to be found the old
fashioned flowers dear to our grandmothers and more particularly the
old fashioned flowers native to English and Scottish soil Between the
two gardens a thick row of tall splendid sunflowers made a stately
hedge Then came larkspur peonies stocks and sweetwilliams verbenas
and mignonette with borders of lobelia and heliotrope Along the fence
were sweet peas for which Alberta is famous

But it was the part of the garden close about the front porch and
verandah where the particular genius of Richard Dunbar showed itself
Here the flowers native to the prairie the coulee the canyon were
gathered the early wind flower the crowfoot and the buffalo bean wild
snowdrops and violets Over trellises ran the tiny morningglory
with vetch and trailing arbutus A bed of wild roses grew to wonderful
perfection Later in the year would be seen the yellow and crimson
lilies daisies white and golden and when other flowers had faded
golden rod and asters in gorgeous contrast The approach to the door of
the house was by a gravel walk bordered by these prairie flowers

The house inside fulfilled the promise of the garden The living room
simple in its plan plain in its furnishing revealed everywhere that
touch in decorative adornment that spoke of the cultivated mind and
refined taste A group of rare etchings had their place over the mantel
above a large open fireplace On the walls were to be seen really fine
copies of the worlds most famous pictures and on the panels which ran
round the walls were bits of pottery and china relics of other days
and of other homes

But what was most likely to strike the eye of a stranger on entering the
living room was the array of different kinds of musical instruments
At one end of the room stood a small upright piano a cello held one
corner a guitar another upon a table a cornet was deposited and on
the piano a violin case could be seen while a banjo hung from a nail on
the wall

Near the fireplace a curiously carved piperack hung with some half
dozen pipes of weird design evidently the collection of years while
just under it a small table held the utensils sacred to the smoker

When Barry entered he found the table set and everything in readiness
for tea

Awfully sorry Im too late to help you with tea dad I have had a long
walk and quite a deuce of a time getting home

All right boy Glad you are here The toast is ready tea waiting to
be infused But what happened No dont begin telling me till you get
yourself ready But hurry your meeting hour will be on in no time

Righto dad Shame to make a slavey of you in this way Ill be out in
a jiffy

He threw off his coat and vest shirt and collar took a pail of water
to a big block in the little shed at the back soused his head and
shoulders in it with loud snorting and puffing and emerged in a few
minutes looking refreshed clean and wholesome his handsome face
shining with vigorous health

Together they stood at the table while the son said a few words of
reverent grace

Im ravenous dad What Fried potatoes Oh you are a brick

Tired boy

No That reminds me of my thrilling tale which I shall begin after
my third slice of toast and not before You can occupy the precious
minutes dad in telling me of your excitements in the office this
afternoon

Dont sniff at me I had a few though apparently you think it
impossible in my humdrum grey life

Good said Barry his mouth full of toast Go on

Young Neil Fraser is buying or has just bought the SQR ranch
Filed the transfer today

Neil Fraser Hes in my tale too Bought the SQR Where did he get
the stuff

Stuff

Dough the dirt the wherewithal in short the currency dad

Barry you are ruining your English said his father

Yumyum Bully Did you notice that dad Im coming on eh One thing
I almost pray about that I might become expert in slinging the modern
jaw hash Im appallingly correct in my forms of speech But go on dad
Im throwing too much vocalisation myself You were telling me about
Neil Fraser Give us the chorus now

I dont like it boy said his father shaking his head and
especially in a clergyman

But thats where you are off dad The trouble is when I come within
range of any of my flock all my flip vocabulary absolutely vanishes
and I find myself talking like a professor of English or a maiden lady
school maam of very certain age

I dont like it boy Correct English is the only English for a
gentleman

I wonder said the lad But I dont want to worry you dad

Oh as for me that matters nothing at all but I am thinking of you
and of your profession your standing

I know that dad I sometimes wish you would think a little more about
yourself But what of Neil Fraser

He has come into some money He has bought the ranch

Barrys tone expressed doubtful approval Neil is a good sort dad
awfully reckless but I like him said Barry He is up and up with it
all

Now what about your afternoon said his father

Well to begin with I had a dose of my old friend the enemy

Barry you dont tell me Your asthma His father sat back from the
table gazing at him in dismay And I thought that was all done with

So did I dad But it really didnt amount to much Probably some
stomach derangement more likely some of that pollen which is floating
around now I passed through a beaver meadow where they were cutting
hay and away I went in a gale of sneezing forty miles an hour But Im
all right now dad Im telling you the truth You know I do

Yes yes I know said his father concern and relief mingling in his
voice but you dont know how to take care of yourself Barry But go
on with your tale

Well as I was panting along like a heavey horse as Harry Hobbs
would saynot really too bad dadalong comes that big rancher
Stewart Duff driving his team of pinto bronchos and with him a chap
named Bayne from Red Pine Creek He turned out to be an awfully decent
sort And Duffs dog Slipper ranging on ahead a beautiful setter

Yes I have seen him

They discussed for a few moments the beauties and points of Duffs
Slipper for both were keen sportsmen and both were devoted to dogs
Then Barry went back to his tale and gave an account of what had
happened during the ride home

You see Slipper ranging about got on point and beautiful work it was
too Out jumped Duff with his gun ready to shoot though of course he
knew it was out of season and that he was breaking the law Well just
as Slipper flushed the birds I shouted to Duff that he was shooting out
of season He missed

Oh he was properly wrathful at my spoiling his shot cried the young
man

I dont know that I blame him Barry said his father thoughtfully
It is an annoying thing to be shouted at with your gun on a bird you
know extremely annoying

But he was breaking the law dad cried Barry indignantly

I know I know But after all

But dad you cant sit there and tell me that you dont condemn him
for shooting out of season You know nothing makes you more furious than
hearing about chaps who pot chicken out of season

I know I know my boy The father was apparently quite distressed
You are quite right but

Now dad I wont have it You are not to tell me that I had no
business to stop him if I could Besides the law is the law and sport
is sport

I quite agree Barry Believe me I quite agree Yet all the same a
chap does hate to have his shot spoiled and to shout at a fellow with
his gun on a birdwell youll excuse me Barry but it is hardly the
sporting thing

Sporting Sporting said Barry I know that I hated to do it but
it was right Besides talk about sportingwhat about shooting out of
season

Yes yes Well we wont discuss it Go on Barry

But I dont like it dad I dont like to think that you dont approve
of what I do It was a beastly hard thing to do anyway I had to make
myself do it It was my duty The young man sat looking anxiously at
his father

Well my boy said his father I may be wrong but do you think you
are always called upon to remonstrate with every law breaker No listen
to me he continued hurriedly What I mean is must you or any of us
assume responsibility for every criminal in the land

Barry sat silent a moment considering this proposition

I wish I knew dad You know I have often said that to excuse myself
after I have funked a thing and let something go by without speaking up
against it

Funked it

Yes Funked standing up for the right thing you know

Funked it said his father again You wouldnt do that Barry

Oh wouldnt I though I am afraid you dont know me very well dad
However I rather think I had started him up before that you know You
wont like this either But I may as well go through with it You know
he was swearing and cursing most awfully just in his ordinary talk you
know and that is a thing I cant stand so I up and told him he was
using too many damns

You did eh In spite of himself the father could not keep the
surprise out of his voice Well that took some nerve at any rate

There you are again dad You think I had no right to speak But
somehow I cant help feeling I was right For dont you see it would
have seemed a bit like lowering the flag to have kept silent

Then for Gods sake speak out lad I do not feel quite the same way as
you but it is what you think yourself that must guide you But go on
go on

Well I assure you he was in a proper rage and if it hadnt been
for Bayne I believe he would have trimmed me to a peak administered a
fitting castigation I mean

He would eh said the father with a grim smile I should like to see
him try

So should I dad if you were around I think I see youfeint with
the right then left right left bing bang bung All over but the
shiver eh dad It would be sweet But he added regretfully thats
the very thing a fellow cannot do

Cannot do And why not pray It is what every fellow is in duty bound
to do to a bully of that sort

Yes but to be quite fair dad you could hardly call Duff a bully At
least he wasnt bullying me As a matter of fact I was bullying him
Oh I think he had reason to be angry When a chap undertakes to pull
another chap up for law breaking perhaps he should be prepared to take
the consequences But to go on Bayne stepped inawfully decent of
him toowhen just at that moment as novelists say with startling
suddenness occurred an event that averted the impending calamity Along
came Neil Fraser no less in that new car of his in a whirlwind of
noise and dust honking like a flock of wild geese Well you should
have seen those bronchos One lurch and we were on the ground a
beautiful upset and the bronchos in an incipient runaway fortunately
checked by your humble servant Duff in a new and real rage this time
up with his gun and banged off both barrels after the motor car by this
time honking down the trail

By Jove he deserved it said the father Those motor fellows make me
long to do murder at times

Thats because you have no car Dad of course

Did he hit him do you think

No My arm happened to fly up the gun banged toward the zenith
Nothing doing

Well Barry you do seem to have run foul of Mr Duff

Three times dad But each time prevented him from breaking the law and
doing himself and others injury Would you have let him off this last
time dad

No no boy Human life has the first claim upon our care You did
quite right quite right Ungovernable fool he must be Shouldnt be
allowed to carry a gun

So Bayne declared said Barry

Well you have had quite an exciting afternoon But finish your tea and
get ready for the meeting I will wash up

Not if I know it dad You take your sawhorse and do me a little
Handel or Schubert Do please entreated his son I want that before
meeting more than anything else I want a change of mood I confess I am
slightly rattled My address is all prepared but I must have atmosphere
before I go into the meeting

His father took the cello and after a few moments spent in carefully
tuning up began with Handels immortal Largo then he wandered into
the Adagio Movement in Haydns third Sonata from thence to Schuberts
Impromptu in C Minor after which he began the Serenade when he was
checked by his son

No not that dad thats sickening I consider that the most morally
relaxing bit of music that I know It frays the whole moral fibre Give
us one of Chopins Ballades or better still a bit of that posthumous
Fantasie Impromptu the largo movement Ah fine fine

He flung his dishcloth aside ran to the piano and began an
accompaniment to his fathers playing

Now dad the Largo once more before we close They did the Largo once
and again then springing from the piano Barry cried That Largo is
a means of grace to me There could be no better preparation for a
religious meeting than that If you would only come in and play for
them it would do them much more good than all my preaching

If you would only take your music seriously Barry replied his
father somewhat sadly you would become a good player perhaps even a
great player

And then what dad

His father waved him aside putting up his cello

No use going into that again boy

Well I couldnt have been a great player at any rate dad

Perhaps not boy perhaps not said his father Great players are
very rare But it is time for your meeting

So it is dad Awfully sorry I didnt finish up those dishes Let them
go till I return I wish you would dad and come along with me His
voice had a wistful note in it

Not tonight boy I think We will have some talk after You will only
be an hour you know

All right dad said Barry Some time you may come He could not
hide the wistful regret of his tone

Perhaps I shall boy replied his father

It was the one point upon which there was a lack of perfect harmony
between father and son When the boy went to college it was with the
intention of entering the profession of law for which his father had
been reading in his young manhood when the lure of Canada and her broad
free acres caught him and he had abandoned the law and with his wife
and baby boy had emigrated to become a land owner in the great Canadian
west

Alas death that rude spoiler of so many plans broke in upon the
sanctity and perfect peace of that happy ranch home and ravished it of
its treasure leaving a broken hearted man and a little boy orphaned
and sickly to be cared for The ranch was sold the rancher moved to
the city of Edmonton thence in a few years to a little village some
twentyfive miles nearer to the Foothills where he became the Registrar
and Homestead Inspector for the district

Here he had lived ever since training the torn tendrils of his heart
about the lad till peace came back again though never the perfect
joy of the earlier days Every May Day the two were wont to go upon an
expedition many miles into the Foothills to a little sunny spot where
a strong palisaded enclosure held a little grave So little it looked
and so lonely amid the great hills There not in an abandonment of
grief but in loving and grateful remembrance of her whose dust the
little grave now held of what she had been to them and had done for
them they spent the day returning to take up again with hearts solemn
tender and chastened the daily routine of life

That his son should grow to take up the profession of law had been the
fathers dream but during his university course the boy had come under
the compelling influence of a spiritual awakening that swept him into
a world filled with new impressions and other desires Obeying what
he felt to be an imperative call the boy chose the church as his
profession and after completing his theological course in the city of
Winnipeg and spending a year in study in Germany while still a mere
youth he had been appointed as missionary to the district of which his
own village was the centre

But though widely separate from each other in the matter of religion
there were many points of contact between them They were both men of
the great outofdoors and under his fathers inspiration and direction
the boy had come to love athletic exercises of all kinds They were
both musicmad the father having had in early youth a thorough musical
education the boy possessing musical talent of a high order Such
training as was his he had received from his father but it was confined
to one single instrument the violin To this instrument upon which his
father had received the tuition of a really excellent master the son
devoted long hours of study and practice during his boyhood years and
his attainments were such as to give promise of something more than
an amateurs mastery of his instrument His college work however
interfered with his music and to his fathers great disappointment and
regret he was forced to lay aside his study of the violin On the piano
however the boy developed an extraordinary power of improvisation and
of sight reading and while his technique was faulty his insight his
power of interpretation were far in excess of many artists who were his
superiors in musical knowledge and power of execution Many were the
hours the father and son spent together through the long evenings of
the western winter and among the many bonds that held them in close
comradeship none was stronger than their common devotion to music

Long after his son had departed to his meeting the father sat dreaming
over his cello wandering among the familiar bits from the old masters
as fancy led him nor was he aware of the lapse of time till his son
returned

Hello Ninethirty he exclaimed looking at his watch You have
given them an extra dose tonight

Business meeting afterwards which didnt come off after all said
his son Postponed till next Sunday With this curt announcement and
without further comment he sat down at his desk

But after a few moments he rose quickly saying Let us do some real
work dad

He took up his violin His father who was used to his moods without
question or remark proceeded to tune up An hours hard practice
followed without word from either except as regarded the work in hand

I feel better now dad said the young man when they had finished
And now for a round with you

But what about your wind boy I dont like that asthma of yours this
afternoon

I am quite all right Its quite gone I feel sure it was the pollen
from the beaver meadow

They cleared back the table and chairs from the centre of the room
stripped to their shirts put on the gloves and went at each other with
vim Their style was similar for the father had taught the son all
he knew except that the fathers was the fighting and the sons the
sparring style Tonight the roles appeared to be reversed the son
pressing hard at the infighting the father trusting to his foot work
and countering with the light touch of a man making points

You ARE boring in arent you said the father stopping a fierce
rally

You are not playing up dad said his son I dont feel like soft
work tonight Come to me

As you say replied the father and for the next five minutes Barry
had no reason to complain of soft work for his father went after him
with all the fight that was in him so that in spite of a vigorous
defence the son was forced to take refuge in a runaway game

Now youre going shouted the son making a fierce counter with his
right to a hard driven left which he sidestepped It was a fatal
exposure Like the dart of a snake the right hand hook got him below the
jaw and he was hurled breathless on the couch at the side of the room

Got you now said his father

Not quite yet cried Barry Like a cat he was on his feet breathing
deep breaths dodging about fighting for time

Enough cried his father putting down his hands

Play up shouted Barry who was rapidly recovering his wind No soft
work Watch out

Again the father was on guard while Barry who seemed to have drawn
upon some secret source of strength came at him with a whirlwind
attack feinting jabbing swinging hooking till finally he landed a
short half arm on the jaw which staggered his father against the wall

Pax cried the young man I have all I want

Great said his father I believe you could fight boy if you were
forced to

In the shed they sluiced each other with pails of water had a rub down
and got into their dressing gowns

I feel fine now dad and ready for anything said Barry glowing
with his exercise and his tub I was feeling like a quitter I guess
that asthma got at my nerve But I believe I will see it through some
way

Yes said his father and waited

Yes They were talking blue ruin in there tonight Finances are
behind congregation is running down therefore the preacher is a
failure

Well lad remember this said his father never let your liver
decide any course of action for you Some good stiff work a turn
with the gloves for instance is the best preparation I know for any
important decision A man cannot decide wisely when he feels grubby
Your asthma this afternoon is a symptom of liver

It is humiliating to a creature endowed with conscience and intellect
to discover how small a part these play at times in his decisions
The ancients were not far wrong who made the liver the seat of the
emotions

Well said his father it is a good thing to remember that most of
our bad hours come from our livers So the preacher is a failure Who
said so

Oh a number of them principally Hayes

Thank God and go to sleep said his father If Hayes were pleased
with my preaching I should greatly suspect my call to the ministry

But seriously I am certainly not a great preacher and perhaps not
a preacher at all They say I have no pep which with some of them
appears to be the distinctive and altogether necessary characteristic of
a popular preacher

What said Innes enquired his father

Did you ever hear Innes say much From his silence one would judge that
he must possess the accumulated wisdom of the ages

When he does talk however he generally says something What was his
contribution

Ah weel said the silent one Ah doot hes no a Spurgeon not yet a
Billy Sunday but yell hardly be expectin thae fowk at Wapiti for nine
hundred dollars a year Then bless his old heart he added But the
bairns tak to him like ducks to water so youd better bide a bit So
they decided to bide a bit till next Sunday Dad at first I wanted
to throw their job in their faces only I always know that it is the old
Adam in me that feels like that so I decided to bide a bit too

It is a poor job after all my boy said his father Its no
gentlemans job the way it is carried on in this country To think of
your being at the bidding of a creature like Hayes

He could have said no better word The boys face cleared like the
sudden shining of the sun after rain He lifted his head and said

Thank God not at his bidding dad One is your Master he quoted
But after all Hayes has something good in him Do you know I rather
like him Hes

Oh come now well drop it right there said his father in a
disgusted tone When you come to finding something to like in that rat
I surrender

Who knows said the boy as if to himself Poor Hayes He may be
quite a wonderful man considering all things his heredity and his
environment What would I have been dad but for you

His father grunted pulled hard at his pipe coughed a bit then looked
his son straight in the face saying God knows what any of us owe to
our past He fell into silence His mind was far away following his
heart to the palisaded plot of ground among the Foothills and the little
grave there in which he had covered from his sight her that had been the
inspiration to his best and finest things and his defence against the
things low and base that had once hounded his soul howling hard upon
his trail

The son knowing his mood sat in silence with him then rising suddenly
he sat himself on the arm of his fathers chair threw his arm around
his shoulder and said Dear old dad Good old boy you are too Good
stuff What would I have been but for you A puny puling wretched
little crock afraid of anything that could spit at me Do you remember
the old gander I was near my eternal damnation that day

But you won out my boy said his father in a croaking voice putting
his arm round his son

Yes because you made me stick it just as you have often made me stick
it since May God forget me if I ever forget what you have done for me
Shall we read now

He took the big Bible from its place upon the table and turning the
leaves read aloud from the teachings of the worlds greatest Master It
was the parable of the talents

Rather hard on the failure he said as he closed the book

No not the failure said his father the slacker the quitter It is
natures law There is no place in Gods universe for a quitter

You are right dad said Barry Goodnight

He kissed his father as he had ever done since his earliest infancy
Their prayers were said in private the son clergyman though he was
could never bring himself to offer to lead the devotions of him at whose
knee he had kneeled every night of his life as a boy for his evening
prayer

Goodnight boy said his father holding him by the hand for a moment
or so We do not know what is before us defeat loss suffering That
part is not in our hands altogether but the shame of the quitter never
need and never shall be ours

The little man stepped into his bedroom with his shoulders squared and
his head erect

By Jove Hes no quitter said his son to himself as his eyes
followed him When he quits hell be dead God keep me from shaming
him



CHAPTER IV

REJECTED


The hour for the church service had not quite arrived but already a
number of wagons buckboards and buggies had driven up and deposited
their loads at the church door The women had passed into the church
where the Sunday School was already in session the men waited outside
driven by the heat of the July sun and the hotter July wind into the
shade of the church building

Through the church windows came the droning of voices with now and then
a staccato rapping out of commands heard above the droning

Thats Hayes said a sturdy young chap brown as an Indian lolling
upon the grass He likes to be bossing something

Thats so Ewen replied a smaller man with a fishlike face his
mouth and nose running into a single feature

I guess hes doin his best Nathan Pilley answered another man
stout and stocky with bushy side whiskers flanking around a rubicund
face out of which stared two prominent blue eyes

Oh I reckon he is Mr Boggs I have no word agin Hayes replied
Nathan Pilley a North Ontario man who abandoning a rocky farm in
Muskoka had strayed to this far west country in search of better
fortune I have no word agin Mr Hayes Mr Boggs he reiterated In
fact I think he ought to be highly commended for his beneficent work

But he does like to hear himself giving out orders all the same
persisted the young man addressed as Ewen

Yes he seems to sorter enjoy that too Ewen agreed Nathan who was
never known to oppose any mans opinion

Hes doin his best insisted Mr Boggs rather sullenly

Yes he is that Mr Boggs he is that said Nathan

But he likes to be the big toad in the puddle said Ewen

Well he certainly seems to he does indeed Ewen

Clear over the droning there arose at this point another sound a chorus
of childish laughter

Thats the preachers class said Boggs Quare sort o Sunday School
where the kids carry on like that

Seems rather peculiar agreed Nathan peculiar in Sunday School it
does

Whats the matter with young Pickles enquired Ewen

The eyes of the company following the pointing finger fell upon young
Pickles standing at the window of the little vestry to the church and
looking in He was apparently convulsed with laughter with his hand
hard upon his mouth and nose as a kind of silencer

Do you know whats the matter with him Pat continued Ewen

Pat McCann the faithful friend and shadow of young Pickles after
studying the attitude and motions of his friend gave answer

Its the preacher I guess Hes kiddin the kids inside Hes some
kidder too he said moving to take his place beside his friend

Whats he doing anyway said Ewen Im going to see

Gradually a little company gathered behind young Pickles and Pat McCann
The window commanded a view of the room yet in such a way that the
group were unobserved by the speaker

Say you ought to seen him do the camel a minute ago whispered
Pickles

In the little vestry room were packed some twenty children of all ages
and sizes with a number of grownups who had joined the class in charge
of some of its younger members There was for instance Mrs Innes
with the two youngest of her numerous progeny pillowed against her
yielding and billowy person and Mrs Stewart Duff an infant of only a
few weeks upon her knee accounting sufficiently for the paleness of
her sweet face and two or three other women with their small children
filling the bench that ran along the wall

Say look at Harry Hobbs said Pat McCann to his friend

Upon the stove which in summer was relegated to the corner of the room
sat Harry Hobbs a man of any age from his appearance thin and wiry
with keen darting eyes which now however were fastened upon the
preacher All other eyes were too Even the smallest of the children
seated on the front bench were gazing with mouths wide open as if
fascinated upon the preacher who moving up and down with quick lithe
steps was telling them a story A wonderful story too it seemed the
wonder of it apparent in the riveted eyes and fixed faces It was
the immortal story matchless in the language of Joseph the Hebrew
shepherd boy who sold into slavery by his brethren became prime
minister of the mighty empire of Egypt The voice tone of the minister
now clear and high now low and soft vibrating like the deeper notes
of the cello was made for story telling Changing with every changing
emotion it formed an exquisite medium to the hearts of the listeners
for the exquisite music of the tale

The story was approaching its climactic denouement the rapturous
moment of the younger brothers revealing was at hand Judah the
older brother was now holding the centre of the stage and making that
thrilling appeal than which nothing more moving is to be found in our
English speech The preachers voice was throbbing with all the
pathos of the tale Motionless the little group hung hard upon the
storyteller when the door opened quickly a red head appeared a
rasping voice broke in

Your class report Mr Dunbar please Were waiting for it

A sigh of disappointment and regret swept the room

Oh darn the little woodpecker said Ewen from the outside in a
disgusted tone Thats the way with Hayes He thinks hes the whole
works and that he never can get in wrong

The spell was broken never to be renewed The story hurried to its
close but the great climax failed of its proper effect

Hes a hummer aint he exclaimed young Pickles to his friend Pat
McCann

Some hummer and then some replied Pat

Im goin in said Pickles

Aw what for He aint no good preachin to them folks By gum I think
hes scared of em

But Pickles persisted and followed with the men and boys who lounged
lazily into the church from which the Sunday School had now been
dismissed

It appeared that the judgment of Pat McCann upon the merits of the
preacher would be echoed by the majority of the congregation present
While the service was conducted in proper form and in reverent spirit
the sermon was marked by that most unpardonable sin of which sermons can
be guilty it was dull Solid enough in matter thoughtful beyond the
average it was delivered in a style appallingly wooden with an utter
absence of that arresting dramatic power that the preacher had shown in
his childrens class

The appearance of the congregation was as ever a reflection of the
sermon The heat of the day the reaction from the long week in the open
air the quiet monotony of the well modulated voice rising and falling
in regular cadence in what is supposed by so many preachers to be
the tone suitable for any sacred office produced an overwhelmingly
somnolent effect Many of them slept some frankly and openly others
under cover of shading hands bowed heads or other subterfuges Others
again spent the whole of the period of the sermon except for some
delicious moments of surreptitious sleep in a painful but altogether
commendable struggle against the insidious influence of the god of
slumber

Among the latter was Mrs Innes whose loyalty to her minister which
was as much a part of her as her breathing contended in a vigorous
fight against her much too solid flesh It was a certain aid to
wakefulness that her two children deep in audible slumber kept her in
a state of active concern lest their inert and rotund little masses of
slippery flesh should elude her grasp and wreck the proprieties of the
hour by flopping on the floor There was also a further sleep deterrent
in the fact that immediately before her sat Mr McFettridge whose
usually erect form yielding to the soporific influences of the
environment showed a tendency gradually to sag into an attitude
relaxed and formless which suggested sleep This to the lady behind
him partook of the nature of an affront to her minister Consequently
she considered it her duty to arouse the snoozing McFettridge with a
vigorous poke in the small of the back

The effect was instantaneously apparent As if her insistent finger had
touched a button and released an electric current Mr McFettridges
sagging form shot convulsively into rigidity and impinging violently
upon the peacefully slumbering Mr Boggs on the extreme end of the
bench toppled him over into the aisle

The astonished Boggs finding himself thus deposited upon the floor and
beholding the irate face of Mr McFettridge glooming down upon him and
fancying him to be the cause of his present humiliating position sprang
to his feet swung a violent blow upon Mr Fettridges ear exclaiming
sotto voce

Take that will you And mind your own business You were sleeping
yourself anyway

Before the astonished and enraged Mr McFettridge could gather his wits
sufficiently for action there rang over the astonished congregation a
peal of boyish laughter It was from the minister A few irrepressible
youngsters joined in the laugh the rest of the congregation however
were held rigid in the grip of a shocked amazement

Oh I say do forgive me Mr McFettridge cried the young man at the
desk It was quite involuntary I assure you Then quickly recovering
himself he added And now we shall conclude the service by singing the
seventyninth hymn

Before the last verse was sung he reminded the audience of the
congregational meeting immediately following and without further
comment the service was brought to a close

A number of the congregation among them Barrys father departed

Sit down Neil said Mrs Innes to Neil Fraser Youll be wanted I
doot And Neil protesting that he knew nothing about church business
sat down

At the back of the church were gathered Harry Hobbs young Pickles
and others of the less important attendants of the church who had been
induced to remain by the rumour of a scrap

By a fatal mischance the pliant Nathan Pilley was elected chairman
This gentleman was obsessed by the notion that he possessed in a high
degree the two qualities which he considered essential to the harmonious
and expeditious conduct of a public meeting namely an invincible
determination to agree with every speaker and an equally invincible
determination to get motions passed

In a rambling and aimless speech Mr Pilley set forth in a somewhat
general way the steps leading up to this meeting and then called
upon Mr Innes the chairman of the Board of Management to state more
specifically the object for which it was called

Mr Innes who was incurably averse to voluble speech whether public or
private arose and said in rolling Doric

Weel Mr Chairrman theres no much to be done Were behind a few
hundred dollars but if some one will go about wi a bit paper nae doot
the arrearrs wad soon be made up and everything wad be arricht

Exactly said Mr Pilley pleasantly Now will some one offer a
motion

Thereupon Mr Hayes was instantly upon his feet and in a voice thin and
rasping exclaimed

Mr Chairman theres business to be done and we are here to do it
and were not going to be rushed through in this way

Exactly Mr Hayes exactly said Mr Pilley We must give these
matters the fullest consideration

Then followed a silence

Perhaps Mr Hayes continued the chairman looking appealingly at
that gentleman

Well Mr Chairman said Mr Hayes with an appeased but slightly
injured air it is not my place to set forth the cause of this meeting
being called If the chairman of the board would do his dutyhere he
glared at the unconscious Mr Inneshe would set before it the
things that have made this meeting necessary and that call for drastic
action

Hear Hear cried Mr Boggs

Exactly so acquiesced the chairman Please continue Mr Hayes

Mr Hayes continued The situation briefly is this We are almost
hopelessly in debt and

How much enquired Neil Fraser briskly interrupting

Seven hundred dollars replied Mr Hayes and further

Five hundred dollars said Mr Innes

I have examined the treasurers books said Mr Hayes in the calmly
triumphant tone of one sure of his position and I find the amount to
be seven hundred dollars and therefore

Five hundred dollars repeated Mr Innes gazing into space

Seven hundred dollars I say snapped Mr Hayes

Five hundred dollars reiterated Mr Innes without further comment

I say I have examined the books The arrears are seven hundred
dollars

Five hundred dollars said Mr Innes calmly

The youngsters at the back snickered

Go to it said Harry Hobbs under his breath

Even the minister who was sitting immediately behind Harry could not
restrain a smile

Mr Chairman cried Mr Hayes indignantly I appeal against this
interruption I assert

Wheres the treasurer said Neil Fraser Whats the use of this
chewin the rag

Ah Exactly so said the chairman greatly relieved Mr
BoggsPerhaps Mr Boggs will enlighten us

Mr Boggs arose with ponderous deliberation

Mr Chairman he said in one sense Mr Hayes is right when he states
the arrears to be seven hundred dollars

Five hundred dollars Am tellin ye said Mr Innes with the first
sign of feeling he had shown

And Mr Innes is also right continued Mr Boggs ignoring the
interruption when he makes the arrears five hundred dollars the two
hundred dollars difference being the quarterly revenue now due

Next week said Mr Innes reverting to his wonted calm

Exactly so said the chairman rubbing his hands amiably so that the
seven hundred dollars we now owe

This was too much even for the imperturbable Mr Innes

He arose in his place moved out into the aisle advanced toward the
platform and with arm outstretched exclaimed in wrathful tones

Mon did ye no hear me tellin ye I want nae mon to mak me a leear

At this point Mr Stewart Duff who had come to convey his wife home
and had got tired waiting for her outside entered the church

Oh get on with the business said Neil Fraser who although enjoying
the scene was becoming anxious for his dinner The question whats to
be done with the five hundred dollars arrears I say lets make it up
right here I am willing to give

No Mr Chairman shouted Mr Hayes who was notoriously averse
to parting with his money and was especially fearful of a public
subscription

There is something more than mere arrearsmuch more

Ay there is emphatically declared Mr McFettridge rising straight
and stiff Im for plain speakin The finances is not the worst about
this congregation The congregation has fallen off Other churches in
this village has good congregations Why shouldnt we The truth is Mr
ChairmanMr McFettridges voice rolled deep and sonorous over the
audiencewe want a popular preachera preacher that drawsa preacher
with some pep

Hear hear cried Mr Boggs Peps what we want Thats itpep

Pep echoed the chairman Exactly so pep

More than that continued Mr McFettridge we want a minister thats
a good mixerone that stands in with the boys

Hear Hear cried Mr Boggs again

A mixer Exactly agreed the chairman A mixer nodding pleasantly
at Mr Boggs

And another thing I will say continued Mr McFettridge now that I
am on my feet We want a preacher that will stick to his jobthat will
preach the gospel and not go meddlin with other matterswith politics
and such like

Or prohibition shouted Harry Hobbs from the rear to the undiluted
joy of the youngsters in his vicinity

The minister shook his head at him

Yes prohibition answered Mr McFettridge facing toward the rear
of the church defiantly Let him stick to his preaching the gospel I
believe the time has come for a change and Im prepared to make a motion
that we ask our minister to resign and that motion I now make

Second the motion cried Mr Boggs promptly

You have heard the motion said the chairman with businesslike
promptitude Are you ready for the question

Question said Mr Hayes after a few moments silence broken by the
shuffling of some members in their seats and by the audible whispering
of Mrs Innes evidently exhorting her husband to action

Then all those in favour of the motion will please

Then from behind the organ a little voice piped up Does this mean Mr
Chairman that we lose our minister

It was Miss Quigg a lady whose years no gallantry could set below
forty for her appearance indicated that she was long past the bloom of
her youth She was thin almost to the point of frailness with sharp
delicately cut features but the little chin was firm and a flash of
the brown eyes revealed a fiery soul within Miss Quigg was the milliner
and dressmaker of the village and was herself a walking model of her
own exquisite taste in clothes and hats It was only her failing health
that had driven her to abandon a much larger sphere than her present
position offered but even here her fame was such as to draw to her
little shop customers from the villages round about for many miles

Does this mean sir that Mr Dunbar will leave us she repeated

Wellyes madamthat is Miss I suppose in a waypractically it
would amount to that

Will you tell me yes or no please Miss Quiggs neat little figure
was all aquiver to the tips of her hat plumes

Well said the chairman squirming under the unpleasant experience of
being forced to a definite answer I supposeyes

Miss Quigg turned from the squirming and smiling Mr Pilley in contempt

Then she said I say no And I believe there are many here who would
say noand men too The wealth of indignation and contemptuous
scorn infused into the word by which the difference in sex of the
human species was indicated made those unhappy individuals glance
shamefacedly at each otheronly they are too timid the creatures or
too indifferent

Again there was an exchange of furtive glances and smiles and an uneasy
shifting of position on the part of the creatures

But if you give them time Mr Chairman I believe they will perhaps
get up courage enough to speak

Miss Quigg sat down in her place behind the organ disappearing quite
from view except for the tips of her plumes whose rapid and rhythmic
vibrations were eloquent of the beating of her gallant little heart

Exactly so said the chairman in confused but hearty acquiescence
Perhaps some one will say something

Then Mr Innes forced to a change of position by the physical
discomfort caused by his wifes prodding rose and said

I dinna see the need o any change Mr Dunbar is no a great preacher
but Ah doot he does his best And the bairns all like him

Then the congregation had a thrill In the back seat rose Harry Hobbs

Im near forty years old he cried in a high nasal tone that
indicated a state of extreme nervous tension and I never spoke in
meetin before I aint had no use for churches and preachers and I
guess they hadnt no use for me You folks all know me Ive been in
this burg for near eight years and I was a drinkin swearin fightin
cuss This preacher came into the barn one day when I was freezin to
death after a big spree He tuk me home with him and kep me there
for two weeks settin up nights with me too Let me be he said
impatiently to Barry who was trying to pull him down to his seat Im
agoin to speak this time if it kills me Many a time I done him dirt
sence then but he stuck to me and never quit till he got me turned
round I was goin straight to hell he says Im goin to heaven now
Here he laughed with a touch of scorn I dunno But by gum if you
fire him and do him dirt I dont know whatll become of me but I guess
Ill go straight to hell again

No Harry no you wont Youll keep right on Harry straight to
heaven It was the preachers voice full of cheery confidence

Mrs Innes was audibly sniffling Mrs Stewart Duff wiping her eyes It
was doubtless this sight that brought her husband to his feet

I dont quite know what the trouble is here he said I understand
there are arrears I heard some criticism of the ministers preaching
I cant say I care much for it myself but I want to say right here that
there are other things wanted in a minister and this young fellow has
got some of them If he stays he gets my money if he doesnt no one
else does Ill make you gentlemen who are kicking about finances a
sporting proposition Im willing to double my subscription if any
other ten men will cover my ante

Ill call you said Neil Fraser and Ill raise you one

Im willing to meet Mr Duff and Mr Fraser said Miss Quigg rising
from behind her organ with a triumphant smile on her face

I aint got much money said Harry Hobbs but Ill go you just half
what I earn if youll meet me on that proposition

Ah may say said Mr Innes yielding to his wifes vigorous vocal and
physical incitations Am prepairred to mak a substantial increase
in my subscreeptionthat is if necessary he added cautiously

Then Barry came forward from the back of the church and stood before the
platform After looking them over for a few moments in silence he said
in a voice clear quiet but with a ring in it that made it echo in
every heart

Had it not been for these last speeches it would have been unnecessary
to allow the motion to go before you I could not have remained where I
am not wanted But now I am puzzled I confess I am really puzzled to
know what to do I am not a great preacher I know but then there are
worse I dont at least I think I dont talk nonsense And I am not
what Mr McFettridge calls a good mixer On the other hand I think
Mr Innes is right when he says the bairns like me at least it would
breakhe paused his lip quivering then he went on quietlyit would
be very hard to think they didnt

They do that then said Mrs Innes emphatically

So you see it is really very difficult to know what to do I would
hate to go away but it might be right to go away I suggest you let me
have a week to think it over Can you wait that long

His handsome boyish face alight with a fine glow of earnestness and
sincerity made irresistible appeal to all but those who for personal
reasons were opposed to him

You see he continued in a tone of voice deliberative and quite
detached there are a number of things to think about Those arrears
for instance are hardly my faultat least not altogether I was
looking over the treasurers books the other day and I was surprised
to find how many had apparently quite forgotten to pay their church
subscription It is no doubt just an oversight For instance he added
in the confidential tone of one imparting interesting and valuable
information you will be surprised to learn Mr Duff that you are
twentyfive dollars behind in your payments

At this Neil Fraser threw back his head with a loud laugh Touche he
said in a joyous undertone

The minister looked at him in surprise and went on And while Mr
Innes and Miss Quigg are both paid up in full Mr Hayes has apparently
neglected to pay his last quarter

Hit him again murmured Harry Hobbs while Mr Hayes rose in virtuous
indignation

I protest Mr Chairman he cried against these personalities

Oh you quite mistake me Mr Hayes said the preacher these are not
personalities I am simply showing how easy it is for arrears to arise
and that it may not be my fault at all Of course it may be right for
me to resign I dont know about that yet but I want to be very sure
It would be easier to resign but I dont want to be a quitter

I move we adjourn said Neil Fraser

I second the motion said Stewart Duff The motion was carried and
the meeting adjourned

At the door the minister stood shaking hands with all as they passed
out making no distinction in the heartiness with which he greeted all
his parishioners To Miss Quigg however he said Thank you You were
splendidly plucky

Nonsense cried the little lady the colour flaming in her faded
cheeks But she added hastily you did that beautifully and he
deserved it the little beast

Solar plexus said Neil Fraser who was immediately behind Miss Quigg

The minister glanced from one to the other in perplexity as they passed
out of the door

But you know I was only

Oh yes we know cried Miss Quigg But if those men would only take
hold Oh those men She turned upon Neil Fraser and shook her head at
him violently

I know Miss Quigg We are a hopeless and helpless lot But were going
to reform

You need to badly she said But you need some one to reform you
Look at Mr Duff there how vastly improved he is and she waved her
hand to that gentleman who was driving away with his wife in their
buckboard

He is a perfect dear sighed Mrs Duff as she bowed to the minister
And you too Stewart she added giving his arm a little squeeze
you said just the right thing when those horrid people were going to
turn him out

Say Your preacher isnt so bad after all said her husband Wasnt
that a neat one for old Hayes

He rather got you though Stewart

Yes he did by Jove Not the first time either hes done it But I
must look after that Say hes the limit for freshness though Or is it
freshness Im not quite sure

Will he stay with us said his wife I really do hope he will

Guess hell stay all right He wont give up his job said her
husband

But next week proved Mr Duff a poor prophet for the minister after
the service informed his people that he had come to the conclusion that
another man might get better results as minister of the congregation he
had therefore handed in his resignation to the Presbytery

It was a shock to them all but he adhered to his resolution in spite of
tearful lamentations from the women wideeyed amazement and dismay from
the bairns of the congregation and indignation loudly expressed from
Neil Fraser and Stewart Duff and others of their kind

Well said Miss Quigg struggling with indignant tears as she was
passing out of the church you wont see Harry Hobbs in this church
again nor me either

Oh yes Miss Quigg Harry has promised me that he will stick by the
church and that he will be there every Sunday And so will you dear
Miss Quigg I know you You will do what is right

But that little lady with her head very erect and a red spot burning in
each faded cheek passed out of the church saying nothing the plumes on
her jaunty little hat quivering defiance and wrath against those men
who had so little spunk as to allow a little beast like Hayes to run
them



CHAPTER V

THE WAR DRUM CALLS


Well dad said Barry next evening as they were sitting in the garden
after tea I feel something like Mohammeds coffin detached from earth
but not yet ascended into heaven Its unpleasant to be out of a job
I confess I shall always cherish a more intelligent sympathy henceforth
for the great unemployed But cheer up dad You are taking this thing
much too seriously The world is wide and there is something waiting me
that I can do better than any one else

But the father had little to say He felt bitterly the humiliation to
which his son had been subjected

Barry refused to see the humiliation

Why should I not resign if I decide it is my duty so to do And why
on the other hand should not they have the right to terminate my
engagement with them when they so desire Thats democratic government

But good Lord Barry burst out his father with quite an unusual
display of feeling to think that a gentleman should hold his position
at the whim of such whippersnappers as Hayes Boggs et hoc genus omne
And more than that that I should have to accept as my minister a man
who would be the choice of cattle like that

After all dad we are ruled by majorities in this age and in this
country That is at once the glory and the danger of democratic
government There is no better way discovered as yet And besides I
couldnt go on here dad preaching Sunday after Sunday to people who I
felt were all the time saying Hes no good to people in short who
could not profit by my preaching

Because it had no pep eh said his father with bitter scorn

Do you know dad I believe thats what is wrong with my preaching it
hasnt got pep What pep is only the initiated know But the long and
the short of this thing is it is the people that must be satisfied It
is they who have to stand your preaching they who pay the piper But
cheer up dad I have no fear for the future

Nor have I my boy not the slightest I hope you did not think for a
moment my son he added with some dignity that I was in doubt about
your future

No no dad We both feel a little sore naturally but the future is
all right

True my dear boy true I was forgetting myself As you say the world
is wide and your place is waiting

Hello here comes my friend Mr Duff said Barry in a low voice He
was ready to throw Mr McFettridge out of the meeting yesterday body
and bones Awfully funny if it hadnt been in church Wonder what he
wants Seems in a bit of a hurry

But hurry or not it was a full hour before Mr Duff introduced his
business As he entered the garden he stood gazing about him in amazed
wonder and delight and that hour was spent in company with Mr Dunbar
exploring the garden Barry following behind lost in amazement at the
new phase of character displayed by their visitor

I have not had such a delightful evening Mr Dunbar for years said
Duff when they had finished making the round of the garden I have
heard about your garden but I had no idea that it held such a wealth
and variety of treasures I had something of a garden myself in the old
country but here there is no time apparently for anything but cattle
and horses and money But if you would allow me I should greatly like to
have the pleasure of bringing Mrs Duff to see your beautiful garden

Mr Duff was assured that the Dunbars would have the greatest pleasure
in receiving Mrs Duff

Do bring her said Barry and we can have a little music too She is
musical I know I hear her sing in church

Music Why she loves it But she dropped her music when she came here
there seemed to be no time no time no time I wonder sometimesWell
I must get at my business It is this letter that brings me It is from
an American whom you know at least he knows you a Mr Osborne Howland
of Pittsburgh

Mr Dunbar nodded

He is planning a big trip up the Peace River country prospecting for
oil and mines and later hunting He says you and your son engaged to
accompany him and he asks me to complete arrangements with you I am
getting Jim Knight to look after the outfit You know Jim perhaps He
runs the Lone Pine ranch Fine chap he is Knows all about the hunting
business Takes a party into the mountains every year Hell take Tom
Fielding with him I dont know Fielding but Knight does Mr Howland
says there will be three of their party Far too many but thats his
business I myself am rather anxious to look after some oil deposits
and this will be a good chance What do you say

Father and son looked at each other

It would be fine if we could manage it said Mr Dunbar but my work
is so pressing just now A great many are coming in and I am alone in
the office at present When does he propose to start

In six weeks time I hope you can come Mr Dunbar I couldnt have
said so yesterday but I can now Any man with a garden like this the
product of his own planning and working is worth knowing So I do
hope you can both come By the way Knight wants a camp hand a kind of
roustabout who can cooka handy man you know

I have him said Barry Harry Hobbs

Hobbs Boozes a bit doesnt he

Not now Hasnt for six months Hes a new man I can guarantee him

You can eh Well my experience is once a boozer always a boozer

Oh said Barry Hobbs is different He is a member of our church you
know

No I didnt know But I dont know that that makes much difference
anyway said Duff with a laugh I dont mean to be offensive he
added

It does to Hobbs hes a Christian man now I mean a real Christian
Mr Duff

Well I suppose there is such a thing In fact Ive known one or two
butwell if you guarantee him Ill take him

I will guarantee him said Barry

Let me have your answer tomorrow said Duff as he bade them
goodnight

The Dunbars discussed the matter far into the night It was clearly
impossible for Mr Dunbar to leave his work and the only question
was whether or not Barry should make one of the party Barry greatly
disliked the idea of leaving his father during the hot summer months
as he said to slave away at his desk and to slop away in his bachelor
diggings He raised many objections but one consideration seemed to
settle things for the Dunbars To them a promise was a promise

If I remember aright Barry we promised that we should join their
party on this expedition

Yes added Barry quickly if our work permitted it

Exactly said his father My work prevents me your work does not

Hence it came that by the end of August Barry found himself in the far
northern wilds of the Peace River country a hundred miles or so from
Edmonton attached to a prospectinghunting party of which Mr Osborne
Howland was the nominal head but of which the boss was undoubtedly
his handsome athletic and impetuous daughter Paula The party had not
been on the trail for more than a week before every member was moving at
her command and apparently glad to do so

The party were camped by a rushing river at the foot of a falls Below
the falls the river made a wide eddy then swept down in a turbulent
rapid for some miles The landing was a smooth and shelving rock that
pitched somewhat steeply into the river

The unfortunate Harry who after the days march had exchanged his heavy
marching boots with their clinging hobnails for shoes more comfortable
but with less clinging qualities in making preparation for the evening
meal made his way down this shelving rock of water No sooner had he
filled his pail than his foot slipped from under him and in an instant
the pail and himself were in the swiftly flowing river

His cry startled the camp

Hello shouted Duff with a great laugh Harry is in the drink I
never knew he was so fond of water as all that Youve got to swim for
it now old boy

Throw him something said Knight

Past them ran Barry throwing off coat and vest

He cant swim he cried tearing at his boots Throw him a line some
one He ran down to the waters edge plunged in and swam toward the
unfortunate Harry who splashing wildly was being carried rapidly into
the rough water

Oh father he will be drowned cried Paula rushing toward a canoe
which was drawn up on the shore Before any one could reach her she had
pushed it out and was steering over the boiling current in Barrys wake
But after a few strokes of her paddle she found herself driven far
out into the current and away from the struggling men Paula had had
sufficient experience with a canoe to handle it with considerable ease
in smooth water and under ordinary conditions but in the swirl of this
rough and swift water the canoe took the management of its course out of
her hands and she had all she could do to keep afloat

For Gods sake men get her cried Brand She will be drowned before
our eyes

Come on Tom cried Jim Knight swinging another canoe into the water
A glance he gave at the girl another at the struggling men for by this
time Barry could be seen struggling with the drowning Hobbs

Get in Tom ordered Knight taking the stern We will get the men
first The girl is all right in the meantime

Get the girl commanded Brand For Gods sake go for the girl he
entreated in a frenzy of distress

No said Knight the men first Shes all right

Here said Duff to Brand pushing out the remaining canoe get into
the bow and stop howling Those men are in danger of being drowned but
Knight will get them Well go for the girl

It took but a few minutes for Knight and Fielding who knew their craft
thoroughly and how to get the best out of her in just such an emergency
to draw up upon Harry and his rescuer

Say they are fighting hard said Fielding That bloody little fool
is choking the life out of Dunbar My God they are out of sight

Go on roared Knight Keep your eyes on the spot and for Heavens
sake paddle

They are up again One of them is Its Barry The other is gone No
by Jove hes got him Hold on Barry were coming yelled Tom Stick
to it old boy

Swiftly the canoe sped toward the drowning men

They are gone this time for sure cried Tom as the canoe shot over
the spot where the men had last been seen

Not much said Knight as reaching out of the stern he gripped Barry
by the hair Hold hard Barry he said quietly No monkey work now or
youll drown us all Immediately Barry ceased struggling

Dont try to get in Barry Well have to tow you ashore

All right Jim he said between his sobbing breaths Onlyhurry
upIve got himhere

Knight reached down carefully lifted Barry till his hand touched the
gunwale of the canoe

Not too hard Barry he said Ill ease you round to the stern
Steady boy steady Dont dump us

All rightJimbuthes under the waterhere

Oh never mind him Well get him all right Can you hold on now said
Knight

YesI think so

Now for Gods sake Tom edge her into the shore See that little eddy
there Swing into that Youll do it all right Good man

By this time Knight was able to get Harrys head above water

In a few minutes they had reached the shore and were working hard over
Harrys unconscious body leaving Barry lying on the sand to recover his
strength A long fight was necessary to bring the life back into Harry
by which time Barry was sufficiently recovered to sit up

Stay where you are Barry until we get this man back to camp ordered
Knight Well light a bit of a fire for you

Im warm enough said Barry

Warm enough You may be but you will be better with a fire and you
lie beside it till we get you Dont move now

Theres the other canoes coming said Fielding Theyll make shore
a little lower down Theyre all right Say shes handling that canoe
like a man

Who said Barry

Why Miss Howland said Fielding She was out after you like a shot
Shes a plucky one

Barry was on his feet in an instant watching anxiously the progress
of the canoes which were being slowly edged across the river in a long
incline toward the shore

Theyll make it all right said Knight after observing them for a
time Dont you worry Just lie down by the fire Well be back in a
jiffy

In an hour they were all safely back in camp and sufficiently recovered
to discover the humorous points in the episode But they were all
familiar enough with the treacherous possibilities of rough and rapid
water to know that for Hobbs and his deliverer at least there had been
some serious moments during their fierce struggle in the river

Another minute would have done said Fielding to his friend as they
sat over the fire after supper

A half a minute would have been just as good said Knight I got
Barry by the hair under water He was at his last kick you bet And
that rat he added smiling good naturedly at Harry was dragging him
down for the last time

I didnt know nothin about it said poor Harry who was lying
stretched out by the fire still very weak and miserable I didnt
know nothin about it or you bet I woudnt ha done it I didnt know
nothin after he got me

After you got him you mean said Fielding

I guess thats right said Harry but I wouldnt ha got him if he
hadnt ha got me first

They all joined in the discussion of the event except Paula who sat
distrait and silent gazing into the fire and Barry who lay drowsy
and relaxed on a blanket not far from her side

You ought to go to bed said Paula at length in a low voice to him
You need a good nights sleep

Im too tired to sleep said Barry I feel rather rotten in fact I
ought to feel very grateful but somehow I just feel rotten

Can one be grateful and feel rotten at the same time said Paula
making talk

Behold me replied Barry I know I am grateful but I do feel rotten
I dont think I have even thanked you for risking your life for me he
added turning toward her

Risking my life Nonsense I paddled round in the canoe for a bit
till two strong men came to tow me in and would have if I had allowed
them Thank the boys who got you in time She shuddered as she spoke

I do thank them and I do feel grateful to them said Barry It was
rather a near thing You see I let him grip me I choked him off my
arms but he slid down to my thigh and I could not kick him off Had to
practically drown him Even then he hung on

Oh dont speak about it she said with a shudder covering her face
with her hands It was too awful and it might have been the end of
you Her voice broke a little

No not an end answered Barry in a quiet voice Not the end by a
long way not by a very long way

What do you mean Oh you are thinking of immortality and all that
said Paula Its a chilly ghostly subject It makes me shiver I get
little comfort out of it

Ghostly it is if you mean a thing of spirits said Barry but
chilly Why chilly Then he added to himself in an undertone I
wonder I wonder I wish sometimes I knew more

Sometimes cried Paula Always she added passionately Its a
dreadful business to me To be suddenly snatched out of the light and
the warmth away from the touch of warm fingers and the sight of dear
faces Ah I dread it I loathe the thought of it I hate it

And yet mused Barry somehow I cannot forget that out there
somewhere there is One kindly genial truelike my dad How good
he has been to memy dad I mean and that Other too has been good
Somehow I think of them together Yes I am grateful to Him

Oh God you mean said Paula a little impatiently

Yes to God He saved me today Saved I say It is a queer way to
speak after all What I really ought to say is that God thought it
best that I should camp round here for a bit longer before moving in
nearer

Nearer

Yes into the nearer circle Life moves round a centre in outer
and inner circles This is the outer circle Nearer in there it is
kindlier with better light and clearer vision We shall know even as
we are known Barry mused on as if communing with himself

But when you move in said Paula and there was no mistaking the
earnestness of her tone you break touch with those you love here

I dont know about that answered Barry quickly

Oh yes you do You are out of all thisall this she swept her
hand at the world around her this good old world all your joy and
happiness all you love Oh thats the worst of it you give up your
love I hate it she concluded with vehemence sudden and fierce as she
shook her fist towards the stars

Give up your love said Barry Not I Not one good honest affection
do I mean to give up nor shall I

Oh nonsense Dont be religious Just be honest said Paula in a
low intense voice Let me speak to you Suppose II love a man with
all my soul and bodyand body mind you and he goes out or goes in
as you say No matter he goes out of my life I lose him he is not
here I cannot feel and respond to his love I cannot feel his strong
arms about me My God Her voice came with increasing vehemence I
want his arms I want him as he is I want his bodyI cannot love a
ghost No no she added in a low hopeless voice When he goes out
I lose him and lose him as mine forever Oh what do I care for your
spirit love The old Greeks were right They are shadesshades mere
shades beyond the river I dont want a shade I want a man a strong
warmhearted brave man Yes a good man a man with a soul But a MAN
not a SOUL My God she moaned how terrible it all is And it came so
near to us today But I should not be saying this to you played out as
you are I am going to bed Goodnight

She put out her hand and gripped his in warm strong muscular fingers
Thank God yes God if you like you are stillstill in this outer
circleshe broke into a laugh but there was little mirth in her
laughterthis good old outer circle yet awhile

Yes said Barry simply but very earnestly thank God It is a good
world But with all my soul I believe there is a better and all that is
best in love and life we shall take with us Goodnight he added and
thank you at least for the will and the attempt to save my life

Sleep well she said

I hope so he replied but I doubt it

His doubts it turned out were justified for soon after midnight Mr
Howland was aroused by Harry Hobbs in a terror of excitement

Will you come to Mr Dunbar sir he cried I think he is dying

Dying Mr Howland was out of his cot immediately and at Barrys side
He found him fighting for breath his eyes starting from his head a
look of infinite distress on his face

My dear boy what is it Hobbs says you are dying

That conconfoundedfoolshouldnt havecalled you I
forbadehim gasped Barry

But my dear boy what is the matter Are you in pain

No noitsnothingonly an oldfriend come backfor a calla
brief onelet ushope Its only asthma Looks badfeels worsebut
reallynot at all dangerous

What can be done my boy asked Mr Howland greatly relieved as
are most laymen when the trouble can be named It is upon the terror
inspired by the unknown that the medical profession lives

Tell Harryto makea hot drink said Barry but Harry had already
forestalled the request and appeared with a steaming bowl This
willhelp Nowgo tobed Mr Howland Do pleaseYou distressme
by remainingthere Harry willlook after me Goodnight

Next morning Barry appeared at breakfast a little washed out in
appearance but quite bright and announcing himself fit for anything

The incident however was a determining factor in changing the partys
plans Already they were behind their time schedule to Mr Cornwall
Brands disgust The party was too large and too heavily encumbered with
impedimenta for swift travel Besides as Paula said Why rush Are we
not doing the Peace River Country We are out for a good time and we
are having it Paula was not interested in mines and oil She did not
announce just what special interest was hers She was having a good
time and that was reason enough for leisurely travel In consequence
their provisions had run low

It was decided to send forward a scouting party to the Hudsons Bay Post
some thirty miles further on to restock their commissariat Accordingly
Knight and Fielding were despatched on this mission the rest of the
party remaining in camp

A lazy day or two in camp is what we all need said Mr Howland I
confess I am quite used up myself and therefore I know you must all
feel much the same

On the fourth day the scouting party appeared

Theres war cried Knight as he touched land He flung out a bundle of
papers for Mr Howland

War The word came back in tones as varied as those who uttered it

War said Mr Howland Between whom

Every one pretty much said Knight Germany France Russia
Austria Servia Belgium and Britain

Britain said Barry and Duff at the same moment

Britain answered Knight solemnly

The men stood stock still looking at each other with awed faces

War again said Barry With Germany He turned abruptly away from
the group and said I am going

Going Going where said Mr Howland

To the war said Barry quietly

To the war You A clergyman said Mr Howland

You You going cried Paula At the pain in her voice her father and
Brand turned and looked at her Disturbed by what he saw her father
began an excited appeal to Barry

Why my dear sir it would surely be most unusual for a man like you
to go to war he began and for quite ten minutes he proceeded to set
forth in fluent and excited speech a number of reasons why the idea
of Barrys going to war was absurd and preposterous to him It must be
confessed that Barry was the only one of the men who appeared to give
much heed to him They seemed to be dazed by the stupendous fact that
had been announced to them and to be adjusting themselves to that fact

When he had finished his lengthy and excited speech Brand took up the
discourse

Of course you dont think of going immediately he said We have this
expedition in hand

The men made no reply Indeed they hardly seemed to hear him

You dont mean to say continued Brand with a touch of indignation in
his voice addressing Duff the recognised leader of the party that
you would break your engagement with this party Mr Duff

Duff glanced at him then looked away in silence studying the horizon
The world was to him and to them all a new world within the last few
minutes

His silence appeared to enrage Brand He turned to Barry

Do you mean to tell me sir that you approve of this Do you consider
it right and fair that these men should break their engagement with us
We have gone to great expense we have extremely important interests at
stake in this exploration

Barry stood looking at him in silence as if trying to take in exactly
what he meant then in a low and awed tone he said

It is war War with Germany

We cannot help that cried Brand What difference can this war make
to you here a hundred miles from civilisation These men are pledged to
us

Their first pledge is to their country sir said Barry gravely

But why should you a Canadian take part in this war argued Mr
Howland Surely this is Englands war

Then Barry appeared to awake as from a dream

Yes it is Englands war it is Britains war and when Britain is at
war my country is at war and when my country is at war I ought to be
there

God in heaven shouted Duff striking him on the back you have said
it My country is at war and I must be there As God hears me I am off
todaynow

Me too said Knight with a shout

Im going with you sir said little Harry Hobbs ranging himself
beside Barry

Count me in said Tom Fielding quietly I have a wife and three kids
but

My God gasped Duff My wife His face went white He had not yet
fully adjusted himself to the fact of war

Why of course said Mr Howland you married men wont be called
upon You must be reasonable For instance you Mr Duff cannot leave
your wife

But Duff had recovered himself

My wife sir My wife would despise me if I stayed up here Sir my
wife will buckle on my belt and spurs and send me off to the war cried
Duff in a voice that shook as he spoke

With a single stride Barry was at his side offering both his hands

Thank God for men like you And in my soul I believe the Empire has
millions of them

Does your Empire demand that you desert those you have pledged yourself
to enquired Brand in a sneering tone

Oh Cornwall exclaimed Paula how can you

Why Brand said Mr Howland that is unworthy of you

We will see you into safety sir said Duff swinging round upon
Brand either to the Hudsons Bay Companys post where you can
get Indians or back to Edmonton but not one step further on this
expedition do I go

Nor I said Knight

Nor I said Fielding

Nor I said Barry

Nor I said Harry Hobbs

You are quite right sir said Mr Howland turning to Barry I
apologise to you sir to all of you Canadians I am ashamed to confess
that I did not at first get the full meaning of this terrific thing that
has befallen your Empire Were it the USA that was in a war of this
kind hell itself would not keep me from going to her aid Nor you
either Brand Yes you are right Go to your war God go with you

He shook hands solemnly with them one by one I only wish to God that
my country were with you too in this thing he said when he had
performed this function

Father cried Paula do you think for one minute that Uncle Sam wont
be in this You put it down she said swinging round upon Barry
where it will jump at you some day We will be with you in this scrap
for all we are worth

And now for the march said Barry who seemed almost to assume
command Then removing his hat and lifting high his hand he said in a
voice thrilling with solemn reverence God grant victory to the right
God save the king

Instinctively the men took off their hats and stood with bared and bent
heads as if sharing in a solemn ritual They stood with millions upon
millions of their kin in the old mother lands and scattered wide upon
the seas stood with many millions more of peoples and nations pledging
to this same cause of right life and love and all they held dear and
with hearts open to that allsearching eye praying that same prayer
God grant victory to the right Amen and amen We ask no other

Then they faced to their hundred miles trek en route to the war



CHAPTER VI

THE MEN OF THE NORTH


Fifty milesnot too bad boy not too bad for a one days go Well
camp right here at the portage How is it Knight

Good place Duff right on that point Good wood good landing Besides
theres a deuce of a portage beyond which we can do after supper
tonight How do you feel Barry asked Knight Hard day eh

Feeling fit a little tired of course but good for another ten
miles answered Barry

Thats the stuff replied Knight looking at him keenly but see
here you must ease up on the carrying You havent quite got over that
ducking of yours

Im fit enough answered Barry rather more curtly than his wont

They brought the canoes up to the landing and with the speed of long
practice unloaded them and drew them upon the shore

Knight approached Duff and pointing toward Barry said quietly

I guess well have to ease him up a bit That fight you know took it
out of him and he always jumps for the biggest pack Wed better hold
him back tomorrow a bit

Cant hold back any one said Duff with an oath Weve got to make
it tomorrow night Theres the devil of a trip before us That big
marsh portage is a heartbreaker and there must be a dozen or fifteen of
them awaiting us and were going to get throughat least I am

All right said Knight with a quick flash of temper Ill stay with
you only I thought we might ease him a bit

Im telling you were going to get through said Duff with another
oath

You neednt tell me Duff said Knight Keep your shirt on

On or off wet or dry sink or swim were going to make that train
tomorrow Knight Thats all about it

Then Knight let himself go

See here Duff Do you want to go on tonight If you do hell and
blazes say the word and Im with you

His face was white as he spoke He seized a tumpline swung the pack
upon his head and set off across the portage

Come on boys he yelled Were going through tonight

Oh hold up Knight said Duff What the hells eating you Well
grub first anyway

No said Knight The next rapid is a bad bit of water and if were
going through tonight I want that bit behind me before it gets too
dark So come along

Oh cut it out Knight said Duff in a gruff but conciliatory tone
Well camp right here

Its all the same to me said Knight flinging his pack down When
you want to go on say the word You wont have to ask me twice

Duff looked over the six feet of bone and sinew and muscle of the young
rancher made as if to answer paused a moment changed his mind and
said more quietly

Dont be an ass Knight Im not trying to hang your shirt on a tree

You know damned well you cant said Knight who was still white with
passion

Oh come off replied Duff Anyway I dont see what young Dunbar is
to you We must get through tomorrow night The overseas contingent is
camping at Valcartier according to these papers and whatever happens I
am going with that contingent

Knight made no reply He was a little ashamed of his temper But during
the past two days he had chafed under the rasp of Duffs tongue and
his overbearing manner He resented too his total disregard of Barrys
weariness for in spite of his sheer grit the pace was wearing the boy
down

We ought to reach the railroad by six tomorrow said Duff renewing
the conversation and anxious to appease his comrade Theres a late
train but if we catch the six we shall make home in good time Hello
whats this coming

At his words they all turned and looked in the direction in which he
pointed

Down a stream which at this point came tumbling into theirs in a
dangerous looking rapid came a canoe with a man in the centre guiding
it as only an expert could

By Jove He cant make that drop said Knight walking down toward the
landing

They all stood watching the canoe which at the moment hung poised upon
the brink of the rapid like a bird for flight Even as Knight spoke the
canoe entered the first smooth pitch at the top Two long swallowlike
sweeps then she plunged into the foam to appear a moment later
fighting her way through the mass of crowding crested waves which
like whitefanged wolves upon a doe seemed to be hurling themselves
upon her intent upon bearing her down to destruction

By the living jumping Jemima said Fielding in an awestricken tone
shes gone

Shes through cried Knight

Great Jehoshaphat said Fielding Hes a bird

With a flip or two of his paddle the stranger shot his canoe across the
stream and floated quietly to the landing

Barry ran down to meet him

I say that was beautifully done he cried taking the nose of the
canoe while the man stepped ashore and stood a moment looking back at
the water

A leetle more to the left would have been better I think She took
some water he remarked in a slow voice as if to himself

He was a strangelooking creature He might have stepped out of one of
Fenimore Coopers novels Indeed as Barrys eyes travelled up and down
his long bony stooping slouching figure his mind leaped at once to
the Pathfinder

Come far asked Duff approaching the stranger

Quite a bit he answered in a quiet courteous voice pausing a
moment in his work

Going out enquired Duff

Not yet he said Going up the country first to The Post

Ah we have just come down from there said Duff We started
yesterday morning he added evidently hoping to surprise the man

Yes he answered in a quiet tone of approval Nice little run Nice
little run Bit of a hurry I guess he ventured apologetically

You bet your life we just are This damned war makes a man feel like
as if the devil was after him said Duff

War The man looked blankly at him Whos fightin

Why havent you heard Its been going on for a month We heard only
three days ago as we were going further up the country It knocked our
plans endways and here we are chasing ourselves to get out

War said the man again Whos fightin Uncle Sam after them
Mexicans

No Mexicans hell exclaimed Duff Germany and Britain

Britain The slouching shoulders lost their droop Britain he said
straightening himself up Whats she been doin to Germany

Whats Germany been doing to her and to Belgium and to Servia and
to France answered Duff in a wrathful voice Shes been raising hell
all around You havent seen the papers eh I have them all here

The stranger seemed dazed by the news He made no reply but getting out
his fryingpan and teapail his only utensils he set about preparing
his evening meal

I say said Duff wont you eat with us Were just about ready
Well be glad to have you

The man hesitated a perceptible moment In the wilds men do not always
accept invitations to eat Food is sometimes worth more than its weight
in gold

I guess I will if youve lots of stuff he said at length

Weve lots of grub and we expect to be home by tomorrow night anyway
if things go all right You are very welcome

The man laid down his fryingpan and teapail and walked with Duff
toward his camp

Are you goin he enquired

Going

To the war Guess some of our Canadian boys will be goin likely eh

Going cried Duff You bet your life Im going But come on Well
talk as we eat And we cant stay long either

Duff introduced the party

My names McCuaig said the stranger

Scotch I guess enquired Duff

My father came out with The Company I was born up north Never been
much out but I read the papers he added quickly as if to correct any
misapprehension as to his knowledge of the world and its affairs My
father always got the Times and the Spectator and Ive continued the
habit

Any one who reads the Times and the Spectator said Barry can claim
to be a fairly wellread man My father takes the Spectator too

As they sat down to supper he noticed that McCuaig took off his old
grey felt and crossed himself before beginning toast

As a matter of courtesy Barry had always been asked to say grace before
meals while with the Howland party This custom however had been
discontinued upon this trip They had no time for meals They had just
grabbed their grub and run as Harry Hobbs said

While they ate Duff kept a full tide of conversation going in regard to
the causes of the war and its progress as reported in the papers Barry
noticed that McCuaigs comments though few revealed a unique knowledge
of European political affairs during the last quarter of a century He
noticed too that his manners at the table were those of a gentleman

After supper they packed their stuff over the long portage leaving
their tent and sleeping gear with their food however to be taken in
the morning For a long time they sat over the fire Barry reading for
McCuaigs benefit the newspaper accounts of the Belgian atrocities the
story of the smashing drive of the German hosts and the retreat of the
British army from Mons

What exclaimed McCuaig the British soldiers goin back Runnin
away from them Germans

Well the Germans are only about ten to one not only in men but in
guns and in this war its guns that count Guns can wipe out an army of
heroes as easily as an army of cowards said Duff

And them women and children said McCuaig Are they killing them
still

Youre just right they are replied Duff and will till we stop
them

McCuaigs eyes were glowing with a deep inner light They were wonderful
eyes quick darting straightlooking and fearless the eyes of a man
who owes his life to his vigilance and his courage

Before turning in for the night Barry went to the rivers edge and
stood looking up at the stars holding their steadfast watch over the
turbulent and tossing waters below

Quiet aint they said a voice at his shoulder

Why you startled me Mr McCuaig I never heard you step

McCuaig laughed his quiet laugh

Got to move quietly in this country he said if you are going to
keep alive

A moment or so he stood by Barrys side looking up with him at the
stars

No fuss up there he said interpreting Barrys mood and attitude
Not like that there pitchin tossin threatenin water

No said Barry but though they look quiet I suppose if we could
really see there is a most terrific whirling of millions of stars up
there going at the rate of thousands of miles a minute

Millions of em and all whirlin about said McCuaig in an
awestricken voice Its a wonder they dont hit

They dont hit because they each keep their own orbit said Barry
and they obey the laws of their existence

Orbut enquired McCuaig Whats that

The trail that each star follows said Barry

I see said McCuaig each one keeps its own trail its own orbut
and so theres peace up there And I guess thered be peace down here if
folks did the same thing Its when a man gets out of his own orbut
and into another fellows that the scrap begins I guess thats where
Germanys got wrong

Something like that replied Barry

And sometimes continued McCuaig his eyes upon the stars when a
little one comes up against a big one he gets busted eh

Barry nodded

And a big one when he comes up against a bigger one gets pretty badly
jarred eh

I suppose so said Barry

Thats whats goin to happen to Germany said McCuaig

Germanys a very powerful nation said Barry The most powerful
military nation in the world

What said McCuaig Bigger than Britain

Britain has two or three hundred thousand men in her army Germany has
seven millions or more with seventy millions of people behind them
organised for war Of course Britain has her navy but then Germany has
the next biggest in the world Oh its going to be a terrific war

I say said McCuaig putting his hand on Barrys shoulder You dont
think it will bother us any to lick her

It will be the most terrible of all Britains wars replied Barry It
will take every ounce of Britains strength

You dont tell me exclaimed McCuaig as if struck by an entirely new
idea Say are you really anxious young man

I am terribly anxious replied Barry I know Germany a little I
spent a year there She is a mighty nation and she is ready for war

She is eh replied McCuaig thoughtfully He wandered off to the fire
without further word where rolling himself in his blanket and scorning
the place in the tent offered him by Duff he made himself comfortable
for the night

At the break of day Duff was awakened by the smell of something frying
Over the fire bent McCuaig busy preparing a breakfast of tea bacon and
bannocks together with thick slices of fat pork

Breakfast was eaten in haste The days work was before them and there
was no time for talk In a very few minutes they stood ready for their
trip across the portage

With them stood McCuaig His blanket roll containing his grub with
fryingpan and teapail attached lay at his feet his rifle beside it

For a moment or two he stood looking back up the stream by which last
night he had come Then he began tying his paddles to the canoe thwarts
in preparation for packing it across the portage

As he was tying on the second paddle Duffs eye fell on him

Whats up McCuaig he said Arent you going up to the Post

No I guess I aint goin up no more replied McCuaig slowly

What do you mean You arent going back home

No My old shack will do without me for a while I guessSay he
continued facing around upon Duff and looking him squarely in the face
this young chap saysputting his hand upon Barrys shoulderBritain
is going to have a hell of a time licking Germany back into her own
orbut Them papers said last night that Canada was going in strong Do
you think she could use a fellow like me

A silence fell upon the group of men

What Do you mean it McCuaig said Duff at length

The man turned his thin eagle face toward the speaker a light in his
eyes

Why aint you goin Aint every one goin that can If a fellow stood
on one side while his country was fightin where would he live when
its all over He read out of the papers that them Germans were shootin
women and children So his face began to work am I goin to stand
by and ask some one else to make em quit No by God

The men stood watching his face curiously twisted and quivering Then
without a word Duff seized his pack and swung into the trail every
man following him in his order Without pausing except for a brief half
hour at noon and another later in the day for eating they pressed the
trail running what rapids they could and portaging the others until in
the early evening they saw far away a dirty blur on the skyline

Hurrah yelled Fielding Good old firebus waiting for us

Somebody run ahead and hold her said Duff

Barry flung his pack down and started away

Come back here Barry cried Knight Youre not fit Youre all in

Thats right too said McCuaig I guess Ill go

And off he set with the long shuffling tireless trot with which for
a hundred years the runners of the woods have packed their loads and
tracked their game in the wilds of northwestern Canada



CHAPTER VII

BARRICADES AND BAYONETS


The city of Edmonton was in an uproar its streets thronged with
excited men ranchers and cowboys from the ranches lumberjacks from the
foothill camps men from the mines trappers with lean hard faces in
weird garb from the north

The news from the front was ominous Belgium was a smoking waste Her
skies were black with the burning of her towns villages and homesteads
her soil red with the blood of her old men her women and children The
French armies driven back in rout from the Belgian frontier were being
pounded to death by the German hordes Fortresses hitherto considered
impregnable were tumbling like ninepins before the terrible smashing of
Austrian and German sixteeninch guns Already von Kluck with his four
hundred thousand of conquering warriors was at the gates of Paris

Most ominous of all the British army that gallant little sacrificial
army of a scant seventyfive thousand men holding like a bulldog to
the flank of von Bulows mighty army fifty times as strong threatened
by von Kluck on the left flank and by von Housen on the right was
slowing down the German advance but was itself being slowly ground
into the bloody dust of the northern and eastern roads of Northern and
Eastern France

Black days these were for the men of British blood Was the world to
see something new in war Were Germans to overcome men of the race of
Nelson and Wellington and Colin Campbell

At home hundreds of thousands were battering at the recruiting offices
In the Dominions of the Empire overseas it was the same In Canada
a hundred thousand men were demanding a place in the first Canadian
contingent of thirtyfive thousand now almost ready to sail General
Sam at Ottawa was being snowed under by entreating insistent cajoling
threatening telegrams Already northern Alberta had sent two thousand
men The rumour in Edmonton ran that there were only a few places left
to be filled in the north Alberta quota For these few places hundreds
of men were fighting in the streets

Alighting from their train Duff and his men stood amazed aghast
gazing upon the scene before them Duff climbed a wagon wheel and
surveyed the crowd packing the street in front of the bulletin boards

No use this way boys Well have to go around Come on

They went on Up side streets and lanes through back yards and shops
they went until at length they emerged within a hundred yards of the
recruiting office

Duff called his men about him

Boys well have to bluff them he said Youre a party of recruits
that Col Kavanagh expects Youve been sent for Im bringing you in
under orders Look as much like soldiers as you can and bore in like
hell Come on

They began to bore At once there was an uproar punctuated with
vociferous and varied profanity

Duff proved himself an effective leader

Here let me pass he shouted into the backs of mens heads Im on
duty here I must get through to Colonel Kavanagh Keep up there men
keep your line Stand back please Make way

His huge bulk distorted face and his loud and authoritative voice
startled men into temporary submission and before they could recover
themselves he and his little company of hardboring men were through

Twentyfive yards from the recruiting office a side rush of the crowd
caught them

Theyve smashed the barricades a boy from a telegraph pole called
out

Duff and his men fought to hold their places but they became conscious
of a steady pressure backwards

Whats doing now boy shouted Duff to the urchin clinging to the
telegraph pole

The fusileersthey are sticking their bayonets into them

Before the line of bayonets the crowd retreated slowly but Duff and his
company held their ground allowing the crowd to ebb past them until
they found themselves against the line of bayonets

Let me through here sergeant with my party said Duff Im under
orders of Colonel Kavanagh

The sergeant an old British army man looked them over

Have you an order sira written order I mean

No said Duff I havent but the colonel expects us He is waiting
for me now

Sorry sir replied the sergeant my orders are to let no one through
without a written pass

Duff argued stormed threatened swore but to no purpose The N C O
knew his job

Send a note in suggested Barry in Duffs ear

Good idea replied Duff and wrote hurriedly

Here take this through to your colonel he said passing the note to
the sergeant

Almost immediately Colonel Kavanagh came out and greeted Duff warmly

Where in this wide creation have you been Duff he exclaimed Ive
wanted you terribly

Here I am now then answered Duff Six of us Were going with you

It cant be done said the colonel I have only twenty places left
every one promised ten times over

That makes it easy Kavanagh You can give six of them to us

Duff it simply cant be done You know Id give it to you if I
could Ive wires from Ottawa backing up a hundred applicants actually
ordering me to put them on No Its no use continued the colonel
holding up his hand Look here Ill give you a pointer We have got
word today that theres to be a second contingent Neil Fraser is out
there in your district Wapiti raising a company of two hundred and
fifty men We have stripped that country bare already so hes up
against it He wants Wapiti men he says They are no better than any
other but he thinks they are You get out there tonight Duff and get
in on that thing You will get a commission too Now hike Hike Go
Honest to God Duff I want you with my battalion and if I can work it
afterwards Ill get you exchanged but your only chance now is Wapiti
Go for Gods sake go quick

What do you say boys asked Duff wheeling upon his men

I say go said Knight

In this decision they all agreed

Go it is said Duff Right about turn Good luck Kavanagh damn you
I see you have got a good sergeant there

Who McDowell None better You couldnt beat him eh said the
colonel with a grin

The sergeant stood at attention with a wooden face

Hes the kind of man they want in the front lines said Duff The
devil himself couldnt break through where he is

Thats why I have him Good luck Goodbye

Throughout the night they marched now and then receiving a lift from a
ranch wagon and in the grey of the morning weary hungry but resolute
for a place in the Wapiti company they made the village

Early as it was Barry found his father astir with breakfast in
readiness

Hello boy cried his father running to him with outstretched hands

Hello dad answered Barry His father threw a searching glance over
his sons face as he shook his hand warmly

Not a word Barry until you eat Not a word Go get ready for your
bath Ill have it for you in a minute No not one word Quick March
That is the only word these days As you eat Ill give you the news

Resolutely he refused to talk until he saw his son begin upon his
breakfast Then he poured forth a stream of news The whole country was
aflame with war enthusiasm Alberta had offered half a million bushels
of oats for the imperial army and a thousand horses or more The
Calgary district had recruited two thousand men the Edmonton district
as many more All over Canada from Vancouver to Halifax it was the
same

From the Wapiti district twentysix ranchers furnishing their own
horses had already gone Ewen Innes was in Edmonton His brother
Malcolm was in uniform too and his young brother Jim was keen to
enlist Neil Fraser was busy raising a company of Wapiti men Young
Pickles and McCann had joined up as buglers

And so the stream flowed Barry listening with grave face but making no
response

And Im glad youre back my boy Im glad youre back said his
father clapping him on the shoulder

The rest of the meal was eaten in silence They were having each his own
thoughts and for the first time in their life together they kept their
thoughts to themselves

Youre going to your office Dad said Barry when they had cleared
away and set the house in order

No the office is closed and will be for some time I imagine Im
busy with Neil Fraser Im acting paymaster quartermaster recruiting
sergeant and half a dozen other things

Ill go down with you said Barry as his father rose to go

His father came back to him put his hands on his shoulders and said

Barry I want you to go to bed

Nonsense dad Im all right Im going downtown with you

Barry said his father we have hard times before us and you must be
fit I ask you to go to bed and sleep there this forenoon Youre half
asleep now This afternoon we shall face up to our job

His fathers voice was quietly authoritative and Barry yielded

All right dad Ill do as you say and this afternoonwell well
see

At the noonday meal they were conscious of a mutual restraint For the
first time in their lives they were not opening to each other their
innermost souls The experience was as distressing as it was unusual
The father as if in dread of silence was obviously exerting himself
to keep a stream of talk flowing Barry was listening with a face very
grave and very unlike the bright and buoyant face he usually carried
They avoided each others eyes and paid little heed to their food

At length Barry pushed back his chair

Will you excuse me dad he said I think I shall step out a moment
into the garden

Do Barry said his father in obvious relief You are fagged out my
boy

Thanks dad I am a bit played out

And take it easy this afternoon Barry Tonight you will tell me about
your trip andandwell have a talk

Good old dad said Barry You do understand a chap See you later
then he called back as he passed through the door

His father sat gazing before him for some moments with a deep shadow on
his face

There is something wrong with that boy he said to himself I wish I
knew what it was

He set his house in order moving heavily as if a sudden weight of years
had fallen upon his shoulders and took his way slowly down the street

I wonder what it is he mused refusing to give form to a horrible
thought that hovered like a spectre about the windows of his soul

The first glance at his sons face at the time of the evening meal made
his heart sing within him

Hes all right again Hes all right he said to himself jubilantly

Hello dad cried Barry as his father entered the room Suppers
just ready How do you feel eh

Better my boyfirst rate I mean Im properly hungry Youre rested
I can see

Im all right dad Im all right cried Barry in his old cheery way
Dad I want to apologise to you I wasnt myself today but now Im
all right again Dad Ive joined up Im a soldier now he said with a
smile on his face but with anxious eyes turned on his father

Joined up echoed his father Barry you have enlisted Thank God my
boy I fearedI thoughtNo damned if I did he added with such
an unusual burst of passion that Barry could only gaze at him with
astonishment

Forgive me my boy he said coming forward with outstretched hand
For a moment I confess I thought Again he paused apparently unable
to continue

You thought dad cried Barry andforgive me dadI thought too I
ought to have known you better

And I you my son

They shook hands with each other in an ecstasy of jubilation

My God Im glad thats through said the older man We were both
fools Barry but thank God that horror is past Now tell me all about
everythingyour trip your plans Lets have a good talk as we always
do

Come on then dad cried Barry Lets have an eat first By Jove
I feel a thousand years younger I go to the M O tomorrow for an
examination

He is quite unusually severe in his interpretation of the regulations
I understand said his father He is turning men down right and left
He knows of course that there are plenty to choose from But there is
no fear of your fitness Barry

Not much said Barry with a gay laugh

Never had they spent a happier evening together True the spectre of
war would thrust itself upon them but they faced it as menwith a full
appreciation of its solemn reality but without fear and with a quiet
determination to make whatever sacrifice might be demanded of them The
perfect understanding that had always marked their intercourse with
each other was restored The intolerable burden of mutual uncertainty in
regard to each others attitude toward the war was lifted All shadows
that lay between them were gone Nothing else really mattered

The day following Barry received a rude shock The M O after an
examination to his amazement and dismay pronounced him physically
unfit for service

And why pray cried his father indignantly when Barry announced the
astounding report Is the man a fool I understood that he was strict
But you unfit It is preposterous Unfit how

Heart murmur said Barry Sets it down to asthma You remember I told
you I had a rotten attack after my experience last week in the river He
suggested that I apply for a position in an ambulance corps and he is
giving me a letter to Colonel Sidleigh at Edmonton I am going tomorrow
to Edmonton to see Sidleigh and besides I have some church business to
attend to I must call upon my superintendent You remember I made an
application to him for another mission field

He found Colonel Sidleigh courteously willing to accept his application
the answer to which he was informed he might expect in a fortnight
and so went with a comparatively light heart to his interview with his
superintendent

The interview however turned out not entirely as he had expected He
went with an idea of surrendering his appointment His superintendent
made him an offer of another and greater

So they turned you down said the superintendent Well I consider
it most providential You have applied for a position on the ambulance
corps As fine as is that service and as splendid as are its
possibilities I offer you something much finer and I will even say
much more important to our army and to our cause We are in need of men
for the Chaplain Service and for this service we demand the picked men
of our church The appointments that have been made already are some
of them most unsuitable some I regret to say scandalous Let me
tell you sir of an experience in Winnipeg only last week It was my
fortune to fall in with the commanding officer of a Saskatchewan unit
I found him in a rage against the church and all its officials His
chaplain had become so hilarious at the mess that he was quite unable to
carry on

Hilarious inquired Barry

Hilarious sir Yes plain drunk Think of it Think of the crime the
shame of it A man charged with the responsibility of the souls of these
men going to warpossibly to their deathdrunk in their presence
A man standing for God and the great eternal verities incapacitated
before them I took the matter up with Ottawa and I have this
satisfaction at least that I believe that no such appointment will ever
be made again That chaplain I may say too has been dismissed I have
here sir a mission field suitable to your ability and experience I
shall not offer it to you I am offering you the position of chaplain in
one of our Alberta battalions

Barry stood before him dumb with dismay

Of course I want to go to the war he said at length but I am sure
sir I am not the man for the position you offer me

Sir said the superintendent I have taken the liberty of sending in
your name Time was an element Appointments were being rapidly made
and I was extremely anxious that you should go with this battalion I
confess to a selfish interest My own boy Duncan has enlisted in
that unit and many of our finest young men with him I assumed the
responsibility of asking for your appointment I must urge you solemnly
to consider the matter before you decline

Eloquently Barry pleaded his unfitness instancing his failure as a
preacher in his last field

I am not a preacher he protested I am not a mixer They all say
so I shall be impossible as a chaplain

Young man said the superintendent a note of sternness in his voice
you know not what transformations in character this war will work
Would I were twenty years younger he added passionately twenty years
sounder Think of the opportunity to stand for God among your men to
point them the way of duty and fit them for it to bring them comfort
when they need comfort sorely to bring them peace when they most need
peace

Barry came away from the interview more disturbed than he had ever been
in his life After he had returned to his hotel a message from his
superintendent recalled him

I have a bit of work to do he said in which I need your help I
wish you to join me in a visitation of some of the military camps in
this district We start this evening

There was nothing for it but to obey his superintendents orders The
two weeks experience with his chief gave Barry a new view and a new
estimate of the chaplains work As he came into closer touch with camp
life and its conditions he began to see how great was the soldiers
need of such moral and spiritual support as a chaplain might be able
to render He was exposed to subtle and powerful temptations He was
deprived of the wonted restraints imposed by convention by environment
by family ties The reactions from the exhaustion of physical training
from the monotonous routine of military discipline from loneliness and
homesickness were such as to call for that warm sympathetic brotherly
aid and for the uplifting spiritual inspiration that it is a chaplains
privilege to offer But in proportion as the service took on a nobler
and loftier aspect was Barry conscious to a corresponding degree of his
own unfitness for the work

When he returned to the city he found no definite information awaiting
him in regard to a place in the ambulance corps He returned home in an
unhappy and uncertain frame of mind

But under the drive of war events were moving rapidly in Barrys life
He arrived late in the afternoon and proceeding to the military HQ
he found neither his father nor Captain Neil Fraser in the office

Gone out for the afternoon sir was the word from the orderly in
charge

Wandering about the village he saw in a field at its outskirts a squad
of recruits doing military evolutions and physical drill As he drew
near he was arrested by the short snappy tones of the N C O in
charge

That chap knows his job he said to himself and looks like his job
too he added as his eyes rested upon the neat upright soldierlike
figure

Captain Neil he found observing the drill from a distance

What do you think of that he called out to Barry as the latter came
within hailing distance What do you think of my sergeant

Fine replied Barry Where did you get him

What Look at him

I am Pretty natty sergeant he makes too

Lets go out there and Ill introduce him

As they crossed the parade ground the sergeant dropped his military
tone and proceeded to explain in his ordinary voice some details in
connection with the drill Barry catching the sound of his voice
stopped short

You dont mean it Captain Neil Not dad is it

Nobody else said Captain Neil Wait a minute Wait and lets watch
him at his work

For some time they stood observing the work of the new sergeant Barry
was filled with amazement and delight

What do you think of him inquired Captain Neil

But Barry made no reply

My company sergeant major got drunk continued Captain Neil I had no
one to take the drill I asked your father to take it He nearly swept
us off our feet In consequence there he stands my company sergeant
major and let me tell you he will be the regimental sergeant major
before many weeks have passed or Im a German

But his age inquired Barry still in a maze of astonishment

Oh thats all right You dont want them too young I assured the
authorities that he was of proper military age telling them at the
same time that I must have him Hes a wonder and the men just adore
him

I dont wonder at that said Barry

Together they moved over to the squad The sergeant observing his
officer called his men smartly to attention and greeted the captain
with a very snappy salute

Sergeant major let me introduce you to my friend Mr Barry Dunbar
said Captain Neil with a grin

I say dad said Barry still unable to associate his father with this
N C O in uniform who stood before him I say dad where did you get
all that military stuff

Im very rusty my boy very rusty I hope to brush up though The men
are improving I think sir

Im sure of it said Captain Neil How is that wild man from
Athabasca doing

He is finding it hard work sir Im afraid He finds it difficult to
connect up this drill business with the business of war He wants to go
right off and kill Germans But he is making an effort to put up with
me

And you with him eh sergeant major But turn them loose They have
done enough for today and I know your son wants to take you off with
him and get you to explain how you go into the army

The explanation came as they were walking home together

You see boy I felt keenly your disappointment in being rejected from
the fighting forces of the country I felt too that our family ought
to be represented in the fighting line so when Captain Fraser found
himself in need of a drill sergeant I could hardly refuse I would have
liked to have consulted you my boy but

Not at all dad you did perfectly right It was just fine of you Im
as proud as Punch I only wish I could go with you Id like to be in
your squad But never mind Ive two jobs open to me now and I sorely
need your advice

Together they talked over the superintendents offer of the position of
chaplain

I cant see myself a chaplain dad The position calls for an older
man a man of wider experience Many of these men would be almost twice
my age Now the superintendent himself would be the man for the job You
ought to see him at his work with the soldiers I really cant think Im
fit

In this opinion his father rather concurred

An older man would be better Barrya man of more experience would be
of more service and yet I dont know One thing I am sure of if you
accept the position I believe you will fill it worthily After all in
every department this war is a young mans job

Of course said Barry If I went as chaplain it would be in your
unit dad and that would be altogether glorious

I do hope so But we must not allow that however to influence our
decision replied his father

I know I know hurriedly agreed Barry I trust I would not be unduly
influenced by personal considerations

This hope however was rudely dashed by an unexpected call for a draft
of recruits from Captain Neils company that came through from Colonel
Kavanagh to replace a draft suddenly dispatched to make up to strength
another western regiment Attached to the call there was a specific
request which amounted to a demand for the sergeant major for whose
special qualifications as physical and military instructor there was
apparently serious need in Colonel Kavanaghs regiment

With great reluctance and with the expenditure of considerable
profanity Captain Neil Fraser dispatched his draft and agreed to the
surrender of his sergeant major

The change came as a shock to both Barry and his father For some days
they had indulged the hope that they would both be attached to the same
military unit and unconsciously this had been weighing with Barry in
his consideration of his probable appointment as chaplain

The disappointment of their hope was the more bitter when it was
announced that Colonel Kavanaghs battalion was warned for immediate
service overseas and the further announcement that in all probability
the new battalion to which the Wapiti company would be attached might
not be dispatched until some time in the spring

But you may catch us up in England Barry said his father when Barry
was deploring their ill luck No one knows what our movements will be
I do wish however that your position were definitely settled

The decision in this matter came quickly and was without his will or
desire materially hastened by Barry himself

Colonel Kavanaghs battalion being under orders to depart within ten
days a final Church Parade was ordered at which only soldiers and
their kin were permitted to be present The preacher for the day falling
ill from an overweight of war work and Barry being in the city with
nothing to do the duty of preaching at this Parade Service was suddenly
thrust upon him

To his own amazement and to that of his father Barry accepted without
any fear or hesitation this duty which in other circumstances would
have overwhelmed him with dismay But to Barry the occasion was of such
surpassing magnitude and importance that all personal considerations
were obliterated

The war with its horrors its losses its overwhelming sacrifice its
vast and eternal issues was the single fact that filled his mind It
was this that delivered him from that nervous selfconsciousness the
preachers curse that paralyses the mental activities chills the
passions and cloggs the imagination so that his sermon becomes
a lifeless repetition of words previously prepared correct even
beautiful it may be in form logical in argument sound in philosophy
but dead dull and impotent bereft of the fire that kindles the powers
of the soul the emotion that urges to action the imagination that
lures to high endeavour

I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
is your reasonable service

The voice clear vibrant melodious arrested with its first word the
eyes and hearts of his hearers and so held them to the end With the
earnest voice there was the fascination of a face alight with a noble
beauty eyes glowing as with lambent flame

A second time he read the appealing words then paused and allowed his
eyes to wander quietly over the congregation They represented to him in
that hour the manhood and womanhood of his country Sincerely with
no attempt at rhetoric and with no employment of any of its tricks he
began his sermon

This war he said is a conflict of ideals eternally opposed Our
ambitious and ruthless enemy has made the issue and has determined the
method of settlement It is a war of souls but the method of settlement
is not that of reason but that of forcea force that finds expression
through your bodies Therefore the appeal of the Apostle Paul this
oldworld hero to the men of his time reaches down to us in this day
and at this crisis of the worlds history Offer your bodiesthese
living bodiesthese sacred bodiesoffer them in sacrifice to God

There was little discussion of the causes of the war What need They
knew that this war was neither of their desiring nor of their making
There was no attempt to incite hatred or revenge There was little
reference to the horrors of war to its griefs its dreadful agonies
its irreparable losses

From the first word he lifted his audience to the high plane of
sacrament and sacrifice They were called upon to offer upon the altar
of the worlds freedom all that they held dear in lifeyea life
itself It was the ancient sacrifice that the noblest of the race had
always been called upon to make In giving themselves to this cause they
were giving themselves to their country They were offering themselves
to God In simple diction and in clear flowing speech the sermon
proceeded without pause or stumbling to the end The preacher closed
with an appeal to the soldiers present to make this sacrifice of theirs
at once worthy and complete These bodies of theirs were sacred and were
devoted to this cause It was their duty to keep them clean and fit

For a few brief moments he turned to the others present at the
servicethe fathers mothers wives and sweethearts of the soldiers
and reminded them in tones thrilling with tenderness and sympathy that
though not privileged to share in the soldiers service in the front
lines none the less might they share in this sacrifice by patient
endurance of the separation and loss by a cheerful submission to trial
and by continual remembrance in prayer to Almighty God of the sacred
cause and its defenders they might help to bring this cause to victory

In the brief prayer that followed the sermon in words tender simple
heartmoving he led the people in solemn dedication of themselves soul
and body to their country to their cause to their God

The effect of the sermon and prayer was overpowering There were
no tears but men walked out with heads more erect because of the
exaltation of spirit which was theirs And women fearful of the coming
hour of parting felt their hearts grow strong within them with the
thought that they were voluntarily sending their men away Upon the
whole congregation lay a new and solemn sense of duty a new and
uplifting sense of privilege in making the sacrifice of all that they
counted precious for this holy cause

It was the sermon that brought the decision in the matter of Barrys
appointment

What do you think of that Colonel Kavanagh asked Captain Neil
Fraser who came in for the service

A very fine sermon A very notable sermon said the colonel Who is
he

He is my own minister said Captain Neil and he gave me today the
surprise of my life I didnt know it was in him I understand there is
a chance of his being our chaplain He is Sergeant Dunbars son

I wish to Heaven we could take him with us What about it Fraser
Weve got the father why not the son too Theyd both like it

I say Colonel for Heavens sake have a heart I hated to surrender
my company sergeant major I dont think I ought to be asked to
surrender our chaplain

All right Fraser so be it But you have got a wonderful chaplain in
that boy What a face What a voice And thats the kind of a spirit we
want in our men

That very afternoon Captain Neil went straight away to Colonel
Leighton the officer commanding the new regiment to which Captain
Neils company belonged To the colonel he gave an enthusiastic report
of the sermon with Colonel Kavanaghs judgment thereon

I would suggest sir that you wire Ottawa on the matter he urged
If Colonel Kavanagh thought he had a chance he would not hesitate We
really ought to get this fixed I assure you hes a find

Go to it then Fraser Im rather interested to see your earnest
desire for a chaplain The Lord knows you need one Go up to
Headquarters and use my name Say what you like

Thus it came that the following day Barry was informed by wire of his
appointment as chaplain of the new regiment of Alberta rangers

Its at least a relief to have the matter settled said his father to
whom Barry brought his wire Barry Im glad of the opportunity to tell
you that since yesterday my mind has undergone considerable change
I am not sure but that you have found your place and your work in the
war

No dad answered Barry I wasnt responsible for that sermon
yesterday The war was very near and very real to me Those boys were
looking up at me and you were there dad You drew that sermon stuff
out of me

If once why not again At any rate it greatly rejoiced me to know
that it was there in you I dont say I was proud of you my boy I was
proud of you but that is not the word that I should like to use I was
profoundly grateful that I was privileged to hear a sermon like that
from a son of mine Now Barry continued his father this is our last
day together for some months perhaps forever he added in a low tone

Dont daddy dont cried Barry I cant bear to think of that
today

All right Barry but why not It is really far better that we should
face all the possibilities But now that we have this dayand what a
perfect day it isfor our last day together what shall we do with it

I know dadI think you would wish that we take our ride into the
foothills today

It was in my mind my boy I hesitated to suggest it So let us go

It was one of those rare November days that only Alberta knows mellow
with the warm sun and yet with a nip in it that suggested the coming
frost without a ripple of the wind that almost constantly sweeps the
Alberta ranges In the blue sky hung motionless like white ships at
sea bits of cloud The long grass brown yellow and green in a hundred
shades lay like a carpet over the rolling hills and wide spreading
valleys reaching up on every side to the horizon except toward the
west where it faded into the blue of the foothills at the bases of the
mighty Rockies

Up the long trail resilient to their horses feet they cantered where
the going was good or picked their way with slow and careful tread
where the rocky ridges jutted through the black soil

They made no effort to repulse the thought that this was their last day
together nor did they seek to banish the fact of the war With calm
courage and hope they faced the facts of their environment seeking
to aid each other in readjusting their lives to those facts They
were resolutely cheerful The day was not to be spoiled with tears
and lamentations Already each in his own place and time had made his
sacrifice of a comradeship that was far dearer than life The agony of
that hour each had borne in silence and alone No shadow should fall
across this sunny day

By the side of the grave in its little palisaded enclosure they
lingered the father recalling the days of his earlier manhood which
had been brightened by a love whose fragrance he had cherished and
shared with his son through their years together Barry listening with
reverent attention and tender sympathy

I had always planned that I too should be laid here Barry said his
father as they prepared to take their departure but do you know boy
this war has made many changes in me and this is one It seems to me
a very little thing where my body lies if it be offered as you were
saying so beautifully yesterday in sacrifice to our cause

Barry could only nod his head in reply He was deeply moved

You are young Barry said his father noting his emotion and life
is very dear to you my boy

No dad no Not life said Barry brokenly Not life only you dad
I just want you and oh dad continued the boy losing hold of himself
and making no effort to check or hide the tears that ran down his face
if one of us is to go in this waras is likely enoughI only
want that the other should be there at the time It would
beterriblylonelydadto go out myselfwithout you Or to have you
go outaloneWe have always been togetherand you have beenso very
good to me dad I cant help this dadI trybut I am not strong
enoughIm not holding back from the sacrifice dad hurrying his
wordsNo no not that but perhaps you understand

For answer his father put both his arms around his son drew his head
down to his breast as if he had been a child

There there laddie he said patting him on the shoulder I know I
know Oh God how I know We have lived together very closely without
a shadow ever between us and my prayer since this war began has
been that in death if it had to be we might be together and Barry
somehow I believe God will give us that

Good old dad good old boy What a brick you are I couldnt help that
dad Forgive me for being a baby and spoiling the day

Forgive you boy still with his arms around his son Barry I love
you for it Youve never brought me one sorrow nor will you Today and
every day I thank God for you my son

They rode back through the evening toward the camp By the time they
arrived there the sun had sunk behind the mountains and the quiet
stars were riding serenely above the broken floating clouds and in
their hearts was peace



CHAPTER VIII

A QUESTION OF NERVE


Gentlemen may I introduce Captain Dunbar your skypilot padre
chaplain anything you like They say hes a devil of a good preacher
The Lord knows you need one

So Barrys commanding officer introduced him to the mess

He bowed in different directions to the group of officers who in the
anteroom of the mess were having a preprandial cocktail Barry found
a place near the foot of the table and for a few minutes sat silent
getting his bearings

Some of the officers were known to him He had met the commanding
officer Colonel Leighton a typical burly Englishman the owner of
an Alberta horse ranch who well to do to begin with had made money
during his five years in the country He had the reputation of being a
sporting man of easy morality fond of his glass and of good living He
owed his present position partly to political influence and partly
to his previous military experience in the South African war His
popularity with his officers was due largely to his easy discipline and
to the absence of that rigidity of manner which is supposed to go with
high military command and which civilians are wont to find so irksome

Barry had also met Major Bustead the Senior Major of the Battalion and
President of the mess an eastern Canadian with no military experience
whatever but with abounding energy and ambition the close friend and
boon companion of Colonel Leighton he naturally had become his second
in command Barry was especially delighted to observe Major Bayne whom
he had not seen since his first meeting with him some months ago on the
Red Pine Trail Captain Neil Fraser and Lieutenant Stewart Duff were the
only officers about the table whom he recognised except that among
the junior lieutenants he caught the face of young Duncan Cameron the
oldest son of his superintendent and a fine cleanlooking young fellow
he appeared

Altogether Barry was strongly attracted by the clean strong faces about
him He would surely soon find good friends among them and he only
hoped he might be able to be of some service to them

The young fellow on his right introduced himself as Captain Hopeton
He was a young English public school boy who though a failure as a
rancher had proved an immense success in the social circles of the
city Because of this and also of his family connections at home he
had been appointed to a Civil Service position A rather bored manner
and a supercilious air spoiled what would otherwise have been a handsome
and attractive face

After a single remark about the beastly bore of military duty Hopeton
ignored Barry giving such attention as he had to spare from his dinner
to a man across the table with whom apparently he had shared some
rather exciting social experiences in the city

For the first half hour of the meal the conversation was of the most
trivial nature and was to Barry supremely uninteresting Shop talk
was strictly taboo and also all reference to the war The thin stream
of conversation that trickled from lip to lip ran the gamut of sport
spiced somewhat highly with society scandal which even in that little
city appeared to flourish

To Barry it was as if he were in a strange land and among people of a
strange tongue Of sport as understood by these young chaps he knew
little and of scandal he was entirely innocent so much so that many
of the references that excited the most merriment were to him utterly
obscure After some attempts to introduce topics of conversation which
he thought might be of mutual interest but which had fallen quite flat
Barry gave up and sat silent with a desolating sense of loneliness
growing upon his spirit

After the port when smoking was permitted he was offered a cigarette
by Hopeton and surprised that young man mightily by saying that he
never smoked This surprise it is to be feared deepened into disgust
when a few moments later he declined a drink from Hopetons whisky
bottle which a servant brought him

Liquors were not provided at the mess but officers were permitted to
order what they desired

As the bottles circulated tongues were loosened There was nothing foul
in the talk but more and more profanity with frequent apology to the
chaplain began to decorate the conversation Conscious of a deepening
disgust with his environment and of an overwhelming sense of isolation
Barry cast vainly about for a means of escape Of military etiquette he
was ignorant hence he could only wait in deepening disgust for the
O C to give the signal to rise How long he could have endured is
doubtful but release came in a startling and to most of the members
of the mess a truly horrifying manner

In one of those strange silences that fall upon even the noisiest of
companies Colonel Leighton under the influence of a somewhat liberal
indulgence in his whisky bottle began the relation of a tale of very
doubtful flavour In the midst of the laughter that followed the tale
Barry rose to his feet his face white and his eyes aflame and in a
voice vibrating with passion said

May I be excused sir

Why certainly said the colonel pleasantly adding after a moments
hesitation is there anything wrong Dunbar Are you ill

No sir Barrys voice had the resonant quality of a cello string
I mean yes sir he corrected I am ill The atmosphere surrounding
such a tale is nauseating to me

In the horrified silence that followed his remark he walked out from
the room Upon his ears as he stood in the anteroom trembling with
the violence of his passion a burst of laughter fell A sudden wrath
like a hot flame swept his body He wheeled in his tracks tore open the
door and with head high and face set strode to his place at the table
and sat down

Astonishment beyond all words held the company in tense stillness From
Barrys face they looked toward the colonel who too dumfounded for
speech or action sat gazing at his chaplain Then from the end of the
table a few places down from Barry a voice was heard

Feel better Dunbar The cool clear voice cut through the tense
silence like the zip of a sword

I do thank you sir looking him straight in the eye

The fresh air doubtless continued the cool voice I always find
myself that even a whiff of fresh air is a very effective antidote for
threatening vertigo I remember once continued the speaker dropping
into a conversational tone and leaning across the table slightly toward
Barry I was in the room with a company of men And the speaker
entered upon a long and none too interesting relation of an experience
of his the point of which no one grasped but the effect of which every
one welcomed with the profoundest relief He was the regimental medical
officer a tall slight man with a keen eye a pleasant face crowned by
a topknot of flaming hair and with a little dab of hair of like colour
upon his upper lip which he fondly cherished as an important item in
his military equipment

Say the old doc is a lifesaver sure enough said a young subaltern
answering to the name of Sally colloquial for Salford as he stood
amid a circle of officers gathered in the smoking room a few minutes
later A lifesaver repeated Sally with emphasis He can have me for
his laboratory collection after Im through

He is one sure singing bird said another sub a stout overgrown boy
by the name of Booth The nerve of him added Booth in admiration

Nerve echoed a young captain but what about the pilots nerve

Sui generis Train I should say drawled Hopeton

Suey who did you say inquired Sally Whats her second name But
let me tell you I could have fallen on his neck and burst into tears of
gratitude For me continued Sally glancing about the room I dont
hold with that dirt stuff at mess It isnt necessary

Beastly bad form said Hopeton but good Lord Your Commanding
Officer Sally Theres such a thing as discipline you know

What extraordinary thing is it that Sally knows inquired Major
Bustead who lounged up to the group

We were discussing the padres break Major which for my part
drawled Hopeton I consider rotten discipline

Discipline snorted the major By Gad it was a piece of the most
damnable cheek I have ever heard at a mess table He ought to be sent to
Coventry I only hope the O C will get him exchanged

The major made no effort to subdue his voice which was plainly audible
throughout the room

Hush for Gods sake warned Captain Train as Barry entered the door
Here he is

But Barry had caught the majors words For a moment he stood
irresolute then walked quietly toward the group

I couldnt help hearing you Major Bustead he said in a voice
pleasant and under perfect control I gather you were referring to me

I was sir said the major defiantly

And why should I be sent to Coventry or exchanged may I ask Barrys
voice was that of an interested outsider

Because stuttered the Major I consider sir thatthatyou have
been guilty of a piece of damnable impertinence toward your Commanding
Officer I never heard anything like it in my life Infernal cheek I
call it sir

While the major was speaking Barry stood listening with an air of
respectful attention

I wonder he said after a moments thought If I thought I had been
impertinent I should at once apologise But sir do you think it is
part of my duty to allow any man even my Commanding Officer topardon
the disgusting metaphor it is not so disgusting as the action
complained ofto spit in my soup and take it without protest Do you
sir

Iyou The major grew very red in the face You need to learn your
place in this battalion sir

I do said Barry still preserving his quiet voice and manner I
want to learnI am really anxious to learn it Do you mind answering
my question His tone was that of a man who is earnestly but quite
respectfully seeking information from a superior officer

Your question sir stuttered the major youryourquestion Damn
your question and yourself too

The major turned abruptly away Barry heard him quite unmoved stood
looking after him in silence a moment or two then shaking his head
with a puzzled expression on his face moved slowly away from the group

Oh my aunt Caroline breathed Sally into his friend Hopetons ear
resting heavily meanwhile against his shoulder What a score What a
score

A bull begad a clean bull murmured Hopeton supporting his friend
out of the room as he added A little fresh air as a preventative of
vertigo as the old doc says eh Sally

Good Lord is he just a plain ass or what inquired young Booth his
eye following Barry down the room

Ass A mule I should say And one with a good lot of kick in him
replied Captain Train I dont know that I care for that kind of an
animal though

Before many hours had passed the whole battalion had received with
undiluted joy an account of the incident for though the Commanding
Officer was popular with his men to have him called down at his own
mess by one of his own officers was an event too thrilling to give
anything but unalloyed delight to those who had to suffer in silence
similar indignities at the hands of their officers

A notable exception in the battalion however was Sergeant Major
McFetteridge who because of his military experience and of his
reputation as a disciplinarian had been recently transferred to the
battalion To the sergeant major this act of Barrys was but another and
more flagrant example of his fondness for buttin in and the sergeant
major let it be known that he strongly condemned the chaplain for what
he declared was an unheard of breach of military discipline

Of course there were others who openly approved and who admired the
chaplains nerve in standing up to the old man In their opinion he
was entirely justified in what he had said The O C had insulted him
and every officer at the mess by his offcolour story but on the whole
the general result of the incident was that Barrys life became more and
more one of isolation from both officers and men For this reason and
because of a haunting sense of failure the months of training preceding
the battalions departure for England were for Barry one long and almost
uninterrupted misery It seemed impossible to establish any point of
contact with either the officers or the men In their athletics in
their social gatherings in their reading he was quietly ignored and
made to feel that he was in no way necessary An impalpable but very
real barrier prevented his near approach to those whom he was so eager
to serve

This unexpressed opposition was quickened into active hostility by the
chaplains uncompromising attitude on the liquor question By the army
regulations the battalion canteen was dry but in spite of this
many both of the officers and the men freely indulged in the use
of intoxicating drink The effect upon discipline was of course
deplorable and in his public addresses as well as private conversation
Barry constantly denounced these demoralising habits winning thereby
the violent dislike of those especially affected and the latent
hostility of the majority of the men who agreed with the sergeant major
in resenting the chaplains buttin in

It was therefore with unspeakable joy that Barry learned that the
battalion was warned for overseas service Any change in his lot would
be an improvement for he was convinced that he had reached the limit of
wretchedness in the exercise of his duty as chaplain of the battalion

In this conviction however he was mistaken On shipboard he
discovered that there were still depths of misery which he was called
upon to plumb Assigned to a miserable stateroom in an uncomfortable
part of the ship he suffered horribly from seasickness and for the
first half of the voyage lay foodless and spiritless in his bunk
indifferent to his environment or to his fate His sole friend was his
batman Harry Hobbs but of course he could not confide to Harry the
misery of his body or the deeper misery of his soul

It was Harry however that brought relief for it was he that called
the M O to his officers bedside The M O was shocked to find the
chaplain in a state of extreme physical weakness and mental depression
At once he gave orders that Barry should be removed to his own
stateroom which was large and airy and open to the sea breezes The
effect was immediately apparent for the change of room and more
especially the touch of human sympathy did much to restore Barry to his
normal health and spirits A friendship sprang up between the M O
and the chaplain With this friendship a new interest came into Barrys
life and with surprising rapidity he regained both his physical and
mental tone

The doctor took him resolutely in hand pressed him to take his part in
the daily physical drill induced him to share the daily programme of
sports and best of all discovering a violin on board insisted on his
taking a place on the musical programme rendered nightly in the salon
As might be expected his violin won him friends among all of the music
lovers on board ship and life for Barry began once more to be bearable

Returning strength however recalled him to the performance of
his duties as chaplain and straightway in the exercise of what he
considered his duty he came into conflict with no less a personage than
the sergeant major himself The trouble arose over his batman Harry
Hobbs

Harry was a man who in his youthful days had been a diligent patron of
the London music halls and in consequence had become himself an amateur
entertainer of very considerable ability His sailors hornpipes Irish
jigs his old English Northcountry ballads and his coster songs were an
unending joy to his comrades Their gratitude and admiration took forms
that proved poor Harrys undoing and besides some of them took an
unholy joy in sending the chaplains batman to his officer incapable of
service

Barrys indignation and grief were beyond words He dealt faithfully
with the erring Hobbs as his minister as his officer as chaplain but
the downward drag of his environment proved too great for his batmans
powers of resistance Once and again Barry sought the aid of the
sergeant major to rescue Harry from his downward course but the old
sergeant major was unimpressed with the account of Harrys lapses

Is your batman unfit for duty sir he inquired

Yes he is often said Barry indignantly

Did you report him sir inquired the sergeant major

No I did not

Then sir I am afraid that until you do your duty I can do nothing
answered the sergeant major with suave respect

If you did your duty Barry was moved to say then Hobbs would not
need to be reported The regulations governing that canteen should
prevent these frequent examples of drunkenness which are a disgrace to
the battalion

Do I understand sir inquired the sergeant major with quiet respect
that you are accusing me of a failure in duty

I am saying that if the regulations were observed my batman and
others would not be so frequently drunk and the enforcing of these
regulations I understand is a part of your duty

Then sir replied the sergeant major perhaps I had better report
myself to the Commanding Officer

You can please yourself said Barry shortly as he turned away

Very good sir replied the sergeant major I shall report myself at
once

The day following the chaplain received an order to appear before the
O C in the orderly room

Captain Dunbar I understand that you are making a charge against
Sergeant Major McFetteridge was Colonel Leightons greeting

I am making no charge against any one sir replied Barry quietly

What do you say to that Sergeant Major McFetteridge

In reply the sergeant major gave a full and fair statement of the
passage between the chaplain and himself the day before

Is this correct Captain Dunbar asked the O C

Substantially correct sir except that the sergeant major is here on
his own suggestion and on no order of mine

Then I understand that you withdraw your charge against the sergeant
major

I withdraw nothing sir I had no intention of laying a charge and I
have laid no charge against the sergeant major but at the same time I
have no hesitation in saying that the regulations governing the canteen
are not observed and as I understand that the responsibility for
enforcing these regulations is in the sergeant majors hands in that
sense I consider that he has failed in his duty

But the sergeant major was too old a soldier to be caught napping
He had his witnesses ready at hand to testify that the canteen was
conducted according to regulations and that if the chaplains batman
or any others took more liquor than they should neither the corporal in
charge of the canteen nor the sergeant major was to be blamed

All I can say sir replied Barry is that soldiers are frequently
drunk on this ship and I myself have seen them when the worse for
liquor going into the canteen

And did you report these men to their officers or to me Captain
Dunbar or did you report the corporal in charge of the canteen

No sir I did not

Then sir do you know that you have been guilty of serious neglect of
duty said the colonel sternly

Do I understand sir that it is my duty to report to you every man I
see the worse for liquor on this ship

Most certainly replied the colonel emphatically Every breach of
discipline must be reported

I understood sir that an officer had a certain amount of discretion
in a matter of this kind

Where did you get that notion inquired the colonel Let me tell you
that you are wrong Discretionary powers lie solely with me

Then sir I am to understand that I must report every man whom I see
the worse for liquor

Certainly sir

And every officer as well sir

The colonel hesitated a moment fumbled with his papers and then
blurted out

Certainly sir And let me say Captain Dunbar that an officer
especially an officer in your position ought to be very careful in
making a charge against a N C O more particularly the sergeant major
of his battalion Nothing is more calculated to drag down discipline
The case is dismissed

Sir said Barry maintaining his place before the table May I ask
one question

The case is dismissed Captain Dunbar What do you want asked the
colonel brusquely

I want to be quite clear as to my duty in the future sir Do I
understand that if any man or officer is found under the influence of
liquor anywhere in this ship and at any hour of the day or night he
is to be reported at once to the orderly room even though that officer
should be say even the adjutant or yourself Barry said gazing up
at the colonel with a face in which earnestness and candour were equally
blended

The colonel gazed back at him with a face in which rage and perplexity
were equally apparent For some moments he was speechless while the
whole orderly room held its breath

I meanthat youyou understandof course stuttered the colonel
that an officer must use common sense He must be damned sure of what
he says in other words said the colonel rushing his speech

But sir continued Barry

Oh go to the devil sir roared the colonel The case is dismissed

Barry saluted and left the room

Is the man an infernal and condemned fool or what is the matter with
him exclaimed the colonel turning to his adjutant in a helpless
appeal while the orderly room struggled with its grins

The devil only knows said Major Bustead He beats me He is an
interfering and impertinent ass in my opinion but what else he is I
dont know

It is fair to say that the sergeant major bore the chaplain no grudge
for his part in the affair The whole battalion however soon became
possessed of the tale adorned and expanded to an unrecognisable extent
and revelled in ecstasy over the discomfort of the C O The consensus
of opinion was that on the whole the sergeant major had come off with
premier honours and as between the old man and the Sky Pilot as
Barry was coming to be called it was about an even break As for the
Pilot he remained more than ever a mystery and on the whole the
battalion was inclined to leave him alone

The chaplain however had partially at least achieved his aim in
that the regulations governing the canteen were more strictly enforced
to the vast improvement of discipline generally and to the immense
advantage of Harry Hobbs in particular

Soon after this another event occurred which aided materially in
bringing about this same result and which also led to a modification of
opinion in the battalion in regard to their chaplain

To the civilian soldier the punctilio of military etiquette is
frequently not only a bore but at times takes on the appearance of
wilful insult which no grown man should be expected to tolerate To the
civilian soldier born and brought up in wide spaces of the far Northwest
this is especially the case

It is not surprising therefore that McCuaig fresh from his
thirtyfive years of life in the Athabasca wilds should find the
routine of military discipline extremely irksome and the niceties of
military etiquette as from a private to an officer not only foolish
but degrading both to officer and man Under the patient shepherding of
Barrys father he had endured much without protest or complaint but
with the advent of Sergeant Major McFetteridge with his rigid military
discipline and his strict insistence upon etiquette McCuaig passed
into a new atmosphere To the freeborn and freebred recruit from the
Athabasca plains the stiff and somewhat exaggerated military bearing
of the sergeant major was at first a source of quiet amusement later of
perplexity and finally of annoyance For McFetteridge and his minutiae
of military discipline McCuaig held only contempt To him the whole
business was a piece of silly nonsense unworthy of serious men

It was inevitable that the sergeant major should sooner or later
discover this opinion in Private McCuaig and that he should consider
the holding of this opinion as a tendency toward insubordination It was
also inevitable that the sergeant major should order a course of special
fatigues calculated to subdue the spirit of the insubordinate private

It took McCuaig some days to discover that in these frequent fatigues
and special duties he was undergoing punishment but once made the
discovery wrought in him a cold and silent rage which drove him to
an undue and quite unwonted devotion to the canteen which in turn
transformed the reserved selfcontrolled man of the wilds into a
demonstrative disorderly and quarrelsome rookie aching for trouble

Under these circumstances an outburst was inevitable Corporal Ferry
in charge of the canteen furnished the occasion

No more for you McCuaig Youve got more aboard now than you can
carry

To the injury of being denied another beer was added the insult
of suggesting his inability to carry what he had This to a man of
McCuaigs experience in every bar and camp and roadhouse from Edmonton
to the Arctic circle was not to be endured

He leaned over the improvised bar until his face almost touched the
corporals

What he ejaculated but in the single expletive there darted out
such concentrated fury that the little corporal sprang back as from a
striking snake

You cant have any more beer McCuaig said the corporal from a safe
distance

Watch me sonny replied McCuaig

With a single sweep of his hand he snatched two bottles from the ledge
behind the corporals head Holding one aloft he knocked the top off
the other drank its contents slowly and smashed the empty bottle at the
spot where the corporals head had been knocked the top off the second
bottle and was proceeding to drink it in a more or less leisurely
fashion

Private Timms Private Mulligan shouted Corporal Ferry reappearing
from beneath the counter Arrest that man

Wait sonny give me a chance cried McCuaig in a wild high
singsong voice Lifting his bottle to his lips he continued to drink
slowly keeping his eye upon the two privates who were considering the
best method of carrying out their orders

There sonny fill that up again cried McCuaig goodnaturedly when
he had finished his drink tossing the second bottle at the head of
the corporal who being on the alert again made a successful
disappearance

Now then boys come on said McCuaig backing toward the wall and
dropping his hands to his hips With a curse of disappointment that he
found himself without his usual weapons of defence McCuaig raised a
shout sprang into the air cracked his heels together in a double rap
and swinging his arms around his head yelled

Come on my boys Im hungry I am Meat Meat Meat

With each meat his white teeth came together with a snap like that
of a hungry wolf Such was the beastly ferocity in his face and posture
that both Private Timms and Private Mulligan themselves men of more
than average strength paused and looked at the corporal for further
orders

Arrest that man said the corporal again preserving at the same time
an attitude that revealed a complete readiness for swift disappearance
Private McTavish he added calling upon a tall Highlander who was
gazing with admiring eyes upon the raging McCuaig assist Private Timms
and Private Mulligan in arresting that man

Why dont you come yourself sonny inquired McCuaig With a swift
sidestep and a swifter swoop of his long arm he reached for the
corporal who once more found safety in swift disappearance

At that instant the Highlander seeing his opportunity flung himself
upon McCuaig and winding his arms around him hung to him grimly
crying out

Get hold of his legs Queeck Will you

When the sergeant major attracted by the unwonted uproar appeared upon
the scene there was a man on every one of McQuaigs limbs and another
one astride his stomach Heavin like sawlogs shootin a rapid as
Private Corbin a lumberjack from the Eau Claire was later heard to
remark

What is he like now inquired the colonel after listening to the
sergeant majors report of the Homeric combat

He is in a compartment in the hold sir and raging like one demented
He very nearly did for Major Bustead smashing at him with a scantling
that he ripped from the ships timbers sir He still has the scantling
sir

Let him cool off all night said the Commanding Officer after
consultation with the adjutant

Barry who with difficulty had restrained himself during the sergeant
majors report slipped from the room found the M O to whom he
detailed the story and dragged him off to visit the raging McCuaig

They found a corporal on guard outside

I would not open the door sir He is really dangerous

Oh rot replied the M O Open up the door

Excuse me sir said the corporal it is not safe At present he is
clean crazy He is off his nut entirely

The M O stood listening at the door From within came moaning sounds
as from a suffering beast

That man is suffering Open the door ordered the M O peremptorily

The corporal with great reluctance unlocked the padlock shot back the
bolt and then stood away from the door

It is the medical officer McCuaig said the doctor opening the door
slightly

Bang Crash came the scantling upon the door jamb shattering it to
pieces The whole guard flung themselves against the door shoved it
shut and shot the bolt

I warned you sir said the panting corporal Better leave him until
morning Hes a regular devil

He is no more a devil than you are corporal said Barry in a loud
clear voice He is one of the best men in the battalion More than
that he is my friend and if he spends the night there I spend it with
him

So saying and before any one could stop him Barry shot back the bolt
opened the door and with his torchlight flashing before him stepped
inside

Hello McCuaig he called in a quiet clear voice where are you
Its Dunbar you know

He drew the door shut after him The corporal was for following him but
the M O interposed

Stop out he ordered Stay where you are You have done enough
mischief already

But sir hell kill him

This is my case said the M O sharply Fall back all of you out of
sight

Together they stood listening in awestruck silence expecting every
moment to hear sounds of conflict and cries for help but all they
heard was the cool even flow of a quiet voice and after some minutes
had passed the sound of moans mingled with a terrible sobbing

The M O moving toward the corporal and his guard said in a low tone

Take your men down the passage and keep them there until I call for
you

Sir began the corporal

Will you obey my orders said the M O Im in command here Go

Without further words the corporal moved his men away

Half an hour later the sergeant major going his rounds received a
rude shock In the passage leading to McCuaigs compartment he met four
men bearing on a stretcher toward the sick bay a long silent form

Who have you got there corporal he inquired in a tone of kindly
interest

McCuaig sir

McCuaig roared the sergeant major And who

Medical officers orders

Silence there said a sharp voice in the rear Carry on men

And past the astonished sergeant major the procession filed with the
medical officer and the chaplain at its tail end

After the sergeant major had made his report to the O C as was his
duty the M O was sent for What took place at that interview
was never divulged to the mess but it was known that whereas the
conversation began in very loud tones by the Officer Commanding it
ended half an hour later with the M O being shown out of the room by
the colonel himself who was heard to remark

A very fine bit of work Tell him I want to see him when he has a few
minutes and thank you doctor thank you

Who does the old man want to see inquired Sally who with Hopeton
and Booth happened to be passing

The chaplain snapped the M O going on his way

The chaplain By Jove hes a queer one eh

The M O turned sharply back and coming very close to Sally said in a
wrathful voice

A queer one Yes a queer one But if some of you damned young idiots
that sniff at him had just half his guts youd be twice the men you
areShut up Hopeton Listen to me and in words of fiery rage that
ran close to tears he recounted his experience of the last hour

By Jove Doc some guts eh said Sally in a low tone as he moved
away



CHAPTER IX

SUBMARINES BULLPUPS AND OTHER THINGS


A long weird blast from the fog horn followed by two short sharp
toots recalled Barry from his morning dream

Fog he grumbled and turned over to recapture the enchantment of the
Athabasca rapids and his dancing canoe

Overhead there sounded the trampling of feet

Submarines doc he shouted and leaped to the floor broad awake

Whats the row murmured the M O who was a heavy sleeper

For answer Barry ripped the clothes from the doctors bed

Submarines doc he shouted again and buckling on his Sam Brown and
seizing his lifebelt he stood ready to go

What your boots off doc

In the orders of the day before had been an announcement that officers
and men were to sleep fully dressed

Oh the devil exclaimed the doctor hunting through his bedclothes
in desperation I cant sleep in my boots Wheres my tunic Go on old
fellow Ill follow you

Barry held his tunic for him

Here you are Wake up doc And heres your Sam Brown

Barry dropped to lace the doctors boots while the latter was buckling
on the rest of his equipment

All right cried the doctor rushing from the room and leaving his
lifebelt behind him

Barry caught up the lifebelt and followed

Your lifebelt doc he said as they passed up the companion way

Oh Im a peach of a soldier said the doctor struggling into his
lifebelt and swearing deeply the while

Stop swearing doc Its a waste of energy

Oh go to hell

No I prefer Heaven if I must leave this ship but for the present I
believe Im needed here and so are you doc Look there

The doctor glanced out upon the deck

By Jove Youre right old man we are needed and badly I say old
chap he said pausing for a moment to turn to Barry you are a dear
old thing arent you

The deck was a mass of soldiers struggling swearing fighting their way
to their various stations Officers half dressed and half awake were
rushing hither and thither seeking their units swearing at the men
and shouting meaningless orders Over all the stentorian voice of the
sergeant major was vainly trying to make itself understood

In the confusion the cry was raised Were torpedoed Were going
down

There was a great rush for the nearest boats Men flung discipline
to the winds and began fighting for a chance of their lives It was a
terrific and humiliating scene

Suddenly over the tumult was heard a loud ringing laugh

Oh I say Duff Not that way Not that way

Again came the ringing laugh

Immediately a silence fell upon the struggling crowd and for a moment
they stood looking inquiringly at each other That moment of silence was
seized by the sergeant major Like a trumpet his sonorous voice rang out
steady and clear

Fall in men Boat quarters Silence there

He followed this with sharp intelligible commands to his N C Os
Like magic order fell upon the turbulent struggling crowd

Stand steady you there roared the sergeant major who having got
control of his men began to indulge himself in a few telling and
descriptive adjectives

In less than two minutes the men were standing steady as a rock and the
panic was passed

Who was it that laughed up there in that stampede inquired the O C
when the officers were gathered about him in the orderly room

I think it was the Sky Pilot sirthe chaplain sir said Lieutenant
Stewart Duff

Was it you that laughed Captain Dunbar asked the colonel turning
upon Barry

Perhaps I did sir Im sorry if

Sorry exclaimed the colonel Dammit sir you saved the situation
for us all Who told you it was a false alarm

No one sir I didnt know it was a false alarm I was looking at
Lieutenant Duff He checked himself promptly I mean sirwell it
seemed a good place to laugh so I just let it come

The colonels eyes rested with curious inquiry upon the serene face of
the chaplain with its glowing eyes and candid expression A good place
for a laugh It was a damned good place for a laugh and gentlemen I
thank God I have one officer who finds in the face of sudden danger a
good place for a laugh And now I have something to say to you

The O Cs remarks did not improve the officers opinion of themselves
and they slunk out of the roomno other word properly describes the
cowed and shamed appearance of that company of menthey slunk out of
the room They had failed to play the part of British officers in the
face of sudden peril

In his speech to the men the C O made only a single reference to the
incident but that reference bit deep

Men I am thoroughly ashamed and disappointed You acted not like
soldiers but like a herd of steers The difference between a herd of
steers and a battalion of soldiers in the face of sudden danger is
only thisthe steers break blindly for God knows where and end piled
up over a cut bank soldiers stand steady listening for the word of
command

If the O C handled the men with a light hand the sergeant major did
not His tongue rasped them to the raw No one knows a soldier as does
his N C O and no N C O is qualified to set forth the soldiers
characteristics with the intimate knowledge and adequate fluency of
the sergeant major One by one he peeled from their shivering souls the
various layers of their moral cuticle until they stood in their own
and in each others eyes objects of commiseration

Theres just one thing more I wad like ta say to ye The sergeant
majors tendency to Doric was more noticeable in his moments of deeper
feeling but its something for you lads to give heed ta When ye were
scrammlin up yonder like a lot o mavericks at a brandin and yowlin
like a bunch o coyotes there was one man in the regiment who could
laugh Theres lots o animals that the Almighty made can yowl but
theres only one can laugh and thats a mon For Gods sake men when
yere in a tight place try a laugh

For some weeks after this event the chaplain was known throughout the
battalion as the man that can laugh and certain it is that from
that day there existed between the M O and the chaplain a new bond of
friendship

As the ship advanced deeper into the submarine zone the sole topic of
thought and of conversation came to be the convoy Where was that convoy
anyway While the daylight lasted a thousand pairs of eyes swept the
horizon and the intervening spaces of tossing bluegrey water for the
sight of a sinister periscope or for the smudge of a friendly cruiser
and when night fell a thousand pairs of ears listened with strained
intentness for the impact of the deadly torpedo or for the signal of the
protecting convoy

While still a day and a night out from land Barry awoke in the
dim light of a misty morning and proceeded to the deck for his
constitutional There he fell in with Captain Neil Fraser and Captain
Hopeton pacing up and down

Come along Pilot said Captain Neil heartily between whom and the
chaplain during the last few days a cordial friendship had sprung up
Were looking for submarines This is the place and the time for Fritz
if he is going to get us at all

Arm in arm they made the circle of the deck The mist lying like a
bank upon the sea shifted the horizon to within a thousand yards of the
ship

I wish I knew just what lies behind that bank there said Captain
Hopeton pointing over the bow

For some moments they stood peering idly into the mist

By Jove there IS something there said Barry who had a hawks eye

Youve got em too eh laughed Hopeton Ive had em for the last
fortyeight hours Ive been seein things all night

But there is insisted Barry pointing over the port bow

What is it like asked Captain Neil while Hopeton ran for his glass

Ill tell you what its likeexactly like the eye of an oyster in its
pulp And by Jove theres another added Barry excitedly

I cant see anything said Captain Neil

But I can insisted Barry Look there Hopeton

Hopeton fixed his glass upon the mist where Barry pointed

Youre right There is something and there are two of them

Give the Pilot the glass Hopeton said Neil Hes got a good eye

There are two ships boys as Im a sinner but what they are I dont
know cried Barry in a voice tense with excitement Here Neil take
the glass You know about ships

Long and earnestly Captain Neil held the glass in the direction
indicated

Boys by all thats holy theyre destroyers he said at length in a
low voice

Even as they gazed the two black dots rapidly took shape growing
out of the mist into two sea monsters all head and shoulders boring
through the seas each flinging high a huge comb of white spray and
with an indescribable suggestion of arrogant resistless power bearing
down upon the ship at furious speed

Destroyers shouted Captain Neil in a voice that rang through the
ship By gad destroyers

There was no question of friend or foe only Great Britains navy rode
over those seas immune

Upon every hand the word was caught up and passed along In a
marvellously short space of time the rails the boats the rigging all
the points of vantage were thronged with men roaring waving cheering
like mad

With undiminished speed each enveloped in its cloud of spray the
destroyers came one on each side rushed foaming past swept in a
circle around the ship and took their stations alongside riding quietly
at half speed like bulldogs tugging at a leash

Great heavens what a sight At the croak in Hopetons voice the
others turned and looked at him

Youve got it too eh said Captain Neil clearing his own throat

Ive got something God knows answered Hopeton wiping his eyes

I too said Barry swallowing the proverbial lump Those
littlelittle

Bulldogs suggested Hopeton

Bulldog pups said Captain Neil

Thats it said Barry Thats what they are little bulldog pups got
me by the throat all right

Me too by gad said Captain Neil I should have howled out loud in
another minute

Listen to the boys cried Barry

From end to end of the ship rose one continuous roar Good old Navy
Good old John Bull while Hopeton openly abandoning the traditional
reserve and selfcontrol supposed to be a characteristic of the English
public school boy climbed upon the rail and hanging by a stanchion
with one hand and with the other frantically waving his cap over his
head continued to shout

England England England forever

Then above the cheering cries was heard the battalion band and from
a thousand throats in solemn chant there rose the Empires national
anthem God Save the King

That night they steamed into old Plymouth town and the following
morning were anchored safe at Devonport dock Strict orders held the
officers and men on board ship until arrangements for debarkation should
be completed but to Barry and the doctor the Commanding Officer gave
shore leave for an hour

And I would suggest he said that you go and have a talk with that
old boy walking up and down the dock there Yarn to him about Canada
hes wild to know about it

The old naval officer was indeed wild to know about Canada so
that the greater part of their shore leave was spent in answering his
questions and eager though he was to explore the old historic town
before Barry knew it he was in the full tide of a glowing description
of his own Province of Alberta extolling its great ranches its
sweeping valleys its immense resources

And to think you are all British out there exclaimed the old salt

Were all British of course replied Barry but not all from
Britain

I know I know said the officer but that only makes it more
wonderful

Wonderful Why why should it be wonderful

Yes wonderful Oh you Canadians cried the old salt impulsively
stretching out his hand to Barry You Canadians

Surprised Barry glanced at his face Those hard blue eyes were brimming
with tears the leatherlike skin was working curiously about the mouth

Why sir I dont quite understand what you mean said Barry

No and you never will Think of it rushing three thousand miles

Five thousand for some of us interrupted Barry

Fancy that Rushing five thousand miles in this way to help old mother
England and all of your own free will We didnt ask it of you Though
by heaven were grateful for it I find it difficult sir to speak
quietly of this

Not until that moment had Barry caught the British point of view To
him as to all Canadians it had only been a perfectly reasonable and
natural thing that when the Empire was threatened they should spring
into the fight They saw nothing heroic in that They were doing their
simple duty

But think of the wonder of it said the naval officer again that
Canada should feel in that way its response to the call of the blood

The old mans lips were still quivering

That is true sir said the M O joining in the talk but there is
something more Frankly my opinion is that the biggest thing sir with
some of us in Canada is not that the motherland was in need of help
though of course we all feel that but that the freedom of the world
is threatened and that Canada as one of the free nations of the world
must do her part in its defence

A fine spirit said the old gentleman

This fight continued the M O is ours you see as well as yours
and we hate a bully

The old salt swore a great oath and said

You are pups of the old breed and you run true to type Im glad to
know you gentlemen he continued shaking them warmly by the hand

After they had gone a few steps he called Barry back to him

Thats my card sir I should like you to come to see me in London
sometime when you are on leave

Barry glanced at the card and read Commander Howard Vincent R N R

It was very decent of the old boy he said to the Commanding Officer
afterwards when recounting the interview I dont suppose Ill ever
use the card but I do think he really meant it

Meant it exclaimed the Commanding Officer Why Dunbar Im an old
country man and I know Make no mistake These people and especially
these naval people do not throw their cards loosely about You will
undoubtedly hear from him

Its not likely replied Barry but the old gentleman is great stuff
all right

During the long sunny spring day their dinky little train whisked them
briskly through the sweet and restful beauty of the English southern
counties To these men however from the wide sunbaked windswept
plains of western Canada the English landscape suggested a dainty
picture done in soft greys and greens with here and there a vivid
splash of colour where the rich red soil broke through the green But
its tiny fields set off with hedges and lines of trees its little
cleanswept villages with their picturesque church spires its parks
with deer that actually stood still to look at you its splendid manor
houses and at rare intervals its turreted castles gave these men
fresh from the raw unmeasured and unmade west a sense of unreality To
them it seemed a toy landscape for children to play with but as they
passed through the big towns and cities with their tall clustering
chimneys their crowding populations with unmistakable evidences of
great wealth their shipping where the harbours bit into the red coast
line there began to waken in them the thought that this tiny England
so beautifully finished and so neatly adorned was something mightier
than they had ever known

In these tiny fields in these clean swept villages in these manor
houses in these castles in factory and in shipyard were struck deep
the roots of an England whose greatness they had never yet guessed

The next afternoon brought them to the great military camp at
Shorncliffe in a misty rain hungry for their rations had been
exhausted early in the day weary from ship and train travel and eager
to get their feet once again on mother earth

At the little station they were kept waiting in a pouring rain for
something to happen they knew not what The R T O a young Imperial
officer blase with his ten months of war in England had some occult
reason for delaying their departure So while the night grew every
moment wetter and darker the men sat on their kitbags or found such
shelter as they could in the tiny station or in the lee of the goods
trains blocking the railroad tracks growing more indignant and
more disgusted with the British high command the war in general and
registering with increasing intensity vows of vengeance against the
Kaiser who in the last analysis they considered responsible for their
misery

At length the brass hat for whom they had been waiting appeared
upon the scene not in the slightest degree apologetic but very
businesslike and with a highly emphasised military manner After a
little conversation between the brass hat and their Commanding Officer
the latter gave the command and off they set in the darkness for their
first route march on English soil

Through muddy roads and lanes over fields slushy and sodden up hill
and down dale they plodded steadily along At the rear of the column
marched Barry with the M O

Long before they reached their destination their conversation had given
out the M O sucking sullenly at his pipe the bowl upside down The
rear end of the column was very frayed and straggling Why it is that a
perfectly fit company will invariably fray out if placed at the rear
of a marching column no military expert has quite succeeded in
satisfactorily explaining

As he tramped along in the dark by the side of the road the M O
stumbled over a soldier sitting upon the soggy bank

Who are you he inquired shortly

Corporal Thom sir

Whats the matter with you

Im all in sir Ive been sick all day sir

Why didnt you report sick then Cant you get on

I dont think so sir Not for a while at least

Have you any pain any nausea

No sir Im just all in

Do you know our route

Yes sir Ive got the turns down

Well come along then when you can Ill send back a waggon later but
dont wait for that

Yes sir said Corporal Thom

Come on Dunbar Well send a waggon back for these stragglers There
will be a good many of them before long

You go on doc Ill come later said Barry Ill catch up to you

But the M O at the various halts waited in vain for the chaplain to
appear

On arriving at the camp after a long struggle he succeeded in sending
back an Army Service waggon to bring in the stragglers but just as the
waggon was about to leave he heard coming up the road a party stepping
out briskly to the music of their own whistling In the rear of the
party marched the chaplain laden down with one mans rifle and another
mans kitbag

Theyre all here sir said Corporal Thom to the M O with a
distinct note of triumph in his voice All here sir he repeated as
he observed the sergeant major standing at the doctors side

Well done corporal said the sergeant major You brought em all
in That means that no man has fallen out on our first march in this
country

The corporal made no reply but later on he explained the matter to the
sergeant major

Its that Sky Pilot of ours sir he said Blowed if hed let us fall
out

Kept you marching eh

No its his chocolate and his jaw but more his jaw than his
chocolate Hes got lots of both I was all in Id been sick all day
in the train Couldnt eat a bite Well the first thing he gives me a
cake of his chocolate Then he sets himself down in the mud beside me
and me wishin all the time hed go on and leave me for the waggon to
pick up Then he gives me a cigarette and then he begins to talk

Talk what about

Damned if I know but the first thing I knew I was tellin him about
the broncho bustinthats my job you knowand how I won out from
Nigger Jake in the Calgary Stampede until I was that stuck on myself
that I said Well sir wed better get a move on and up he gets with
my kitbag on his back By and by we picks up another lame duck and
then another feedin em with chocolate and slingin his jaw and when
we was at the limit he halts us outside one of them stone shacks and
knocks at the door No soldiers here snaps the redheaded angel
shuttin the door right in his face Then he opens the door and steps
right in where she could see him and starts to talk to her and us
listening out in the rain Say In fifteen minutes we was all standin
up to a feed of coffee and buns and then he gets Harry Hobbs whistlin
and singin and derned if we couldnt have marched to Berlin Say
Hes a good one aint no quitter and he wont let nobody else be a
quitter

And thus it came that with Corporal Thom and his derelicts the chaplain
marched into a new place in the esteem of the men of his battalion and
of its sergeant major

But of this of course Barry had no knowledge He knew that he had made
some little progress into the confidence of both officers and men in his
battalion He had made too some firm friendships which had relieved
to a certain extent the sense of isolation and loneliness that had
made his first months with the battalion so appalling But there still
remained the sense of failure inasfar as his specific duty as chaplain
was concerned

The experiences of the first weeks in England only served to deepen in
him the conviction that his influence on the men against the evils which
were their especial snare was as the wind against the incoming tide
beating in from the North Sea He could make a ripple a certain amount
of fussy noise but the tide of temptation rolled steadily onward
unchecked in its flow

The old temptations to profanity drink and lust that had haunted the
soldiers steps at home were found to be lying in wait for them here
and in aggravated form True in the mess and in his presence among the
men there was less profanity than there had been at the first but it
filled him with a kind of rage to feel that this change was due to no
sense of the evil of the habit but solely to an unwillingness to give
offence to one whom many of them were coming to regard with respect and
some even with affection

I hate that he said to the M O to whom he would occasionally
unburden his soul Youd think I was a kind of policeman over their
morals

Oh I wouldnt worry about that said the M O to whom the habit of
profanity was a very venial sin You ought to be mighty glad that your
presence does act as a kind of moral prophylactic And it does I assure
you I confess that since I have come to be associated with you I am
conscious of a very real and at times distressing limitation of
my vocabulary I may not be more virtuous but certainly I am more
respectable

This sentiment however brought little comfort to the chaplain

I am not a policeman he protested and I am not going to play
policeman to these men I notice them shut up when I come around but I
know quite well that they turn themselves loose when I pass on and
that they feel much more comfortable I am not and will not be their
policeman

What then would you be inquired the M O

Barry pondered this question for some time

To tell the truth he said at length I confess I dont quite
know I wish I did doc on my soul One thing I do know the men are no
better here in their morals than they were at home

Better They are worse by Jove exclaimed the M O Look at
the daily crimesheet Look at that daily orderly room parade Its
something fierce and its getting worse

The wet canteen inquired Barry who had lost prestige with some in
the battalion by reason of the strenuous fight he had made against its
introduction since coming to England Not that the men cared so much
for their liquor but they resented the idea that they were denied
privileges enjoyed by other battalions

The wet canteen echoed the doctor No you know I opposed as you
did the introduction of the wet canteen although not upon the same
grounds I regard it as a perfect nuisance in camp It is the centre of
every disorder it is subversive of discipline it materially
increases my sick parade But it is not the wet canteen that is chiefly
responsible for the growing crimesheet and orderly room parade It is
those damnedI dont apologise

Please dont Say it again exclaimed Barry fervently

Those damned pubs continued the M O stuck at every crossroads in
this country Theyre the cause of ninety per cent of the drunkenness
in our army and more than that I want to give you another bit of
information that came out at our M O conference this week namely that
these pubs account for ninety per cent of our tent hospital cases

Ninety per cent doctor Thats surely high

I would have said so but I am giving you the unanimous verdict of
the twentysix medical officers at the conference Cut out the damned
beerand you know I take my share of itcut out the beer and ninety
per cent of the venereal disease goes With me it is not a question of
morality but of efficiency Here the M O sprang from his chair and
began to pace the hut This is the one thing in this army business that
makes me wild We come over here to fightthese boys are willing to
fightand by gad they will fight They go out for a walk they have a
few beers together their inhibitory powers are paralysed opportunity
comes their way and they wake up a little later diseased God in
heaven I love this dear old England and I would die for her if need
be but may God Almighty damn her public houses and all the infernal
and vicious customs which they nourish

Thank you doctor go right on said Barry I was at the tent
hospital this week for the first time Ever since I have been wanting
to say what you have said just now But what did your M O conference
do about it

What could we do The Home Office blocks the way Well Ive got that
off my stomach and I feel better added the M O with a slight
laugh

But doc I want to say this said Barry I dont believe that the
percentage of men who go in for this sort of thing is large Ive been
making inquiries from our chaplains and they all agree that we have a
mighty fine and clean body of men in our Canadian army

Right you are Of course it is only a small percentage a very small
percentagea much smaller percentage than in our civilian population
at home But small as it is it is just that much too many Hell and
blazes These men are soldiers They have left their homes and their
folks to fight Their peopletheir people are the best in our land
Theres that young Pentland A finer young chap never threw a leg over
a broncho Hes in that tent hospital tonight I know his mother Three
sons she has given Oh damn it all the doctors voice broke at this
point I cant speak quietly Their mothers have given them up to
death if need be but not to this rotten damnable disease Look here
Pilot The doctor pointed a shaking and accusing finger at Barry You
have often spoken against this thing but next time you break loose
give them merry hell over it You cant make it too hot

Long Barry sat silent overborne by the fury of the doctors passionate
indictment

Cheer up old chap said the doctor when his wrath had somewhat
subsided Well lick the Kaiser and beat the devil yet

But doctor what can I do implored Barry Thats part of my job
surely Part of the job of the chaplain service I mean Oh that is the
ghastly tragedy of this work of mine Somehow I cant get at it These
evils exist I can speak against them and make enemies but the things
go on just as before

Dont you believe it Pilot not quite as before Behold how you have
already checked my profanity Even the old man has pretty much cut it
out at mess You dont know where they would have been but for you
Cheer up Our wings may not be visible but on the other hand there are
no signs of horns and hoofs

Doctor one thing Ill do cried Barry with a sudden inspiration
Weve a meeting of the chaplains corps tomorrow Ill give them your
speech

Expurgated edition I hope said the M O

No Ill put in every damn I can remember and if need be a few
more

Lord Id like to be there old boy said the doctor fervently

Barry was as good as his word At the meeting of the chaplains
corps the time was mainly taken up in routine business dealing with
arrangements for religious services at the various camps within the
area

At the close of the meeting however one of the chaplains rose and
announced that he had a matter to bring to the attention of the corpsa
matter of the highest importance which demanded their immediate and
serious attention and which they dared not any longer ignore It was
the matter of venereal disease in our Canadian army

His statistics and illustrative incidents gripped hard the hearts of
the men present He closed with a demand that steps be taken that day to
deal with the situation The Canadian people had entrusted them with
the care of their boys souls Their souls he cried I say our first
duty is to their bodies I am not saying the percentage is large It is
not as large as in the civilian population at home But why any We must
care for these mens bodies They fight with their bodies

His last sentence struck Barry to the heart It recalled his own sermon
spoken in Edmonton to his fathers battalion Immediately he was on his
feet and without preface or apology reproduced as far as he was able
the M Os speech of the previous night and that without expurgation

There was but little discussion There was but one opinion It was
resolved to call a joint meeting of the chaplains and medical officers
to decide upon a course of action

As Barry was leaving the meeting the senior chaplain an old Anglican
clergyman with a saintly face and a smile that set ones tenderest
emotions astir came to him and putting his hand affectionately upon
his shoulder said

And how is your work going my dear fellow

It was to Barry as if his fathers hand were upon his shoulder and
before he was aware he was pouring out the miserable story of his own
sad failure as a chaplain

Poor boy Poor boy the old gentleman kept saying I know how you
feel Just so just so

When Barry had finished relieving his heart of the burden that had so
long lain upon it the old gentleman took him by the hand and said

My dear fellow remember they are far from home These boys need their
mothers They sorely need their mothers And my boy they need God And
they need you Goodbye

Barry came away with a warm feeling in his heart and in it a new
purpose and resolve No longer would he be a policeman to his men He
would try to forget their faults and to remember only how sorely they
needed their mothers and their God and that they needed him too

He found the camp thrilling with great news glorious news The day so
long awaited had come The battalion was under orders for France At
that very moment there was an officers meeting in the orderly room

As Barry entered the room the O C was closing his speech

Barry was immediately conscious of a new tone a new spirit in the
colonels words He spoke with a new sense of responsibility and what
more than anything else arrested Barrys attention with a new sense of
brotherhood toward his officers

In closing what I have to say gentlemen let me make a confession
I am not satisfied with the battalion nor with my officers I am not
satisfied with myself I remember being indignant at the report sent in
by the inspecting officer concerning this battalion I thought he was
unfair and unduly severe I believe I said so Gentlemen I was wrong
Since that time I have seen work in some regiments of the Imperial
Service and especially I have seen the work on the front line I think
I know now what discipline means Discipline gentlemen is the
thing that saves an army from disaster Some things we must cut out
absolutely Whatever unfits for service must go I saw a soldier a
Canadian soldier shot at the front for being intoxicated I pray God
I may never see the like again At this point I wish to express my
appreciation of the work of our chaplain who I am glad to see has just
come in He has stood for the right thing among us and has materially
helped in the discipline and efficiency of this battalion Gentlemen
you have your orders Let there be no failure Obedience is demanded
not excuses Gentlemen carry on

Barry hurried away to his hut The words of his colonel had lifted him
out of his despair He had not then so desperately failed His colonel
had found something in him to approve And France was before him There
was still a chance for service The boys would need him there



CHAPTER X

FRANCE


France sunny France The tone carried concentrated bitterness and
disgust One cursed fraud after another in this war

Cheer up said Barry Theres worse to comeperhaps better This
rain is beastly but the clouds will pass and the sun will shine again
for in spite of the rain this IS sunny France Theres a little homily
for you said Barry and for myself as well for I assure you this
combination of mal de mer and sleet makes one feel rotten

Everything is rotten grumbled Duff gazing gloomily through the
drizzling rain at the rugged outline of wharves that marked the Boulogne
docks

Look at this cried Duff sweeping his hand toward the deck You
would think this stuff was shot out of the blower of a threshing
machinesoldiers baggage kits quartermasters storesand this is a
military organisation Good Lord

Lieutenant Duff Is Lieutenant Duff here It was the O Cs voice

Yes sir said Duff going forward and saluting

Mr Duff I wish you to take charge of the Transport for the present
Lieutenant Bonner is quite uselesshelpless I mean You will find
Sergeant Mackay a reliable man Sorry I couldnt give you longer notice
I think however you are the man for the job

Ill do my best sir said Duff saluting as the O C turned away

What did I tell you Duff said Barry You certainly are in for it
and you have my sympathy

Sympathy Dont you worry about me said Duff This is just the kind
of thing I like I havent run a gang of navvies in the Crows Nest Pass
for nothing You watch my smoke But one word Pilot When you see me
bearing down full steam ahead give me room Ill make this go or bust
something Then in a burst of confidence he took Barry by the arm and
added in a low voice And if I live Pilot Ill be running something
in this war bigger than the Transport of a battalion before Im done

Barry let his eyes run over the powerful figure the rugged passionate
face lit up now with gleaming eyes and said

I believe you Duff Meantime Ill watch your smoke

Do replied Duff with superb selfconfidence And it was worth while
during the next hour to watch Duff evolve order out of chaos First of
all he put into his men and into his sergeant the fear of death But he
did more than that He breathed into them something of his own spirit
of invincible determination He had them springing at his snappy orders
with an eagerness that was in itself the larger half of obedience and
as they obeyed they became conscious that they were working under the
direction of a brain that had a perfected plan of action and that held
its details firmly in its grasp

Not only did Duff show himself a master of organisation and control
but in a critical moment he himself leaped into the breach and did
the thing that balked his men Did a heavy transport wagon jamb at the
gangway holding up the traffic with a spring Duff was at the wheel
A heave of his mighty shoulders and the wagon went roaring down the
gangway Did a horse stupid with terror from its unusual surroundings
balk Duff had a twitch on its upper lip and before it knew what
awful thing had gripped it the horse was lifted clear out of its
tracks and was on its way to the dock

Before he had cleared the ship Duff had a circle of admirers about him
gazing as if at a circus

An energetic officer you have there said the brass hat standing
beside the colonel

A new man This is his first time on the transport replied the
colonel

Quite remarkable Quite remarkable exclaimed the brass hat That
unloading must have been done in record time and in spite of quite
unusual conditions

The boat being clear and the loads made up Duff approached the
Commanding Officer

All ready sir he announced Shall we move off I should like to get
a start The roads will be almost impassable Im afraid

Do you know the route asked the Commanding Officer

Yes sir I have it here

All right go ahead Duff A mighty good piece of work you have done
there

Thank you sir said Duff saluting and turning away

Move off there he shouted to the leading team

The driver started the team but they slipped plunged and fell heavily
Duff was at their heads before any other man could move

Get hold here men he yelled Take hold of that horse What are
you afraid of he cried to a groom who was gingerly approaching the
struggling animal Now then all together

When he had the team on their feet again he said to the grooms standing
at their heads Jump up on the horses backs that will help the them
to hold their footing

There was some slight hesitation on the part of the grooms

Come on he roared and striding to the horse nearest him he flung
himself upon its back

A groom mounted the other and once more a start was made but they had
not gone more than a few steps when the grooms horse fell heavily and
rolled over on its side pinning the unfortunate man beneath him

There was a shriek of agony In an instant Duff was off his horse and at
the head of the fallen animal

Medical officer here he shouted Now then two of you men One of
you pull out that man while we lift

The horses head and shoulders were lifted clear and the injured man
was pulled out of danger

Take him out of the way please doctor said Duff to the M O who
was examining the groom

Sergeant

His sergeant literally sprang to his side

Get me a dozen bags he said

Bags sir I dont know where

Bags repeated Duff savagely Canvas anything to wrap around these
horses feet

The sergeant without further words plunged into the darkness returning
almost immediately with half a dozen bags

Thanks sergeant thats the way to move Now get some more

Under Duffs directions the bags were tied about the feet of the horses
thus enabling them to hold their footing and the transport moved off in
the darkness

Returning from the disposing of the injured man the M O found Barry
shivering with the cold and weak from his recent attack of seasickness

There will be no end of a sick parade tomorrow morning and youll be
one of them grumbled the M O If they dont move them out of here
soon theyll take them away in ambulances There are a hundred men at
this moment fit to go to hospital but the O C wont hear of it

Doc they ought to have something hot The kitchens are left behind I
understand Let me have a couple of your men and let me see what I can
do

Its no use Ive tried all the hotels about here Theyre full up

No harm trying doc said Barry and off he went

But he found the hotels full up as the doctor had said After much
inquiry he found his way to the Y M C A A cheerful but sleepy
secretary half dead with the fatigue of a heavy day ministering to
soldiers going up the line could offer him no help at all

Do you mean to say that there is no place in this town said Barry
desperately where a sick man can get a dish of coffee

Sick man cried the secretary Why certainly Why not try the R A
M C Theyve a hospital half a mile up the street They will certainly
help you out Ill come with you

No you dont said Barry You go back to bed Ill find the place

Half a mile up the street as the secretary had said Barry came upon
the flaring lantern of the R A M C at the entrance to a huge
warehouse the gate of which stood wide open

Entering the courtyard Barry found a group of men about a blazing fire

May I see the officer in charge he asked approaching the group

The men glanced at his rank badges

Yes sir said a sergeant clicking his heels smartly Can I do
anything for you sir

Thank you said Barry and told him his wants

We have plenty of biscuits said the sergeant and coffee too You
are welcome to all you can carry but I dont see how we can do any more
for you But would you like to see the officer in charge sir

Thank you said Barry and together they passed into another room

But the officer was engaged elsewhere While they were discussing the
matter a door opened and a young girl dressed in the uniform of a V
A D Voluntary Aid Detachment appeared

What is it sergeant she inquired in a soft but rather tired voice

The sergeant explained while she listened with mild interest Then
Barry took up the tale and proceeded to dilate upon the wretched
condition of his comrades out in the icy rain But his story moved
the V A D not at all She had seen too much of the real misery and
horrors of war Barry began to feel discouraged and indeed a little
ashamed of himself

You see we have just come over he said in an apologetic tone and
we dont know much about war yet

You are Canadians cried the girl a new interest dawning in her eyes
As she came into the light Barry noticed that they were brown and that
they were very lustrous

I love the Canadians she exclaimed My brother was a liaison
artillery officer at Ypres with them at the time of the gas you know
He liked them immensely Her voice was soft and sad

Unconsciously Barry let his eyes fall to the black band on her arm

He was with the Canadians too when he was killed at Armentieres
three months ago

Killed exclaimed Barry Oh I am so sorry for you

I had two brothers she went on in her gentle even tone One was
killed at Landrecies on the retreat from Mons you know

No said Barry Im afraid I dont know about it Tell me

It was a great fight said the girl Oh a splendid fight A ring
came into her voice and a little colour into her cheek They tried to
rush our men but they couldnt My oldest brother was there in charge
of a machine gun section The machine guns did wonderful work The
colonel came to tell us about it He said it was very fine There was
no sign of tears in her eyes nor tremor in her voice only tenderness
and pride

And your mother is alone now inquired Barry

Oh we gave up our house to the government for a hospital You see
father was in munitions Hes too old for active service and mother is
matron in the hospital She was very unwilling that I should come over
here She said I was far too young but of course thats quite nonsense
So you see we are all in it

It is perfectly amazing said Barry You British women are
wonderful

The brown eyes opened a little wider

Wonderful Why what else could we do But the Canadians I think
theyre wonderful coming all this way to fight

I cant see that said Barry Thats what that old naval boy at
Devonport said but I cant see that its anything wonderful that we
should fight for our Empire

Devonport A naval officer The girl lost her calm She became
excited What was his name

I have his card here said Barry taking out his pocket book and
handing her the card

My uncle she cried Why how perfectly splendid offering Barry
her hand Why were really introduced Then youre the man that Uncle
Howard She stopped abruptly a flush on her cheek Then she turned
to the N C O Yes sergeant that will do as the man brought half a
dozen large biscuit cans and as many large bottles of prepared coffee

As Barrys eyes fell upon the biscuit cans an idea came to him

Will these cans hold water he inquired

Yes sir replied the sergeant

Then were fixed cried Barry in high delight This is perfectly
fine

What do you mean asked the girl

Well dump the biscuits and boil the coffee in the cans I havent
camped on the Athabasca for nothing Now were all right and I suppose
we must go

The V A D hesitated a moment then she took the sergeant to one side
and entered into earnest and persuasive talk with him

Its against regulations miss Barry heard him say and besides you
know were expecting a hospital train any minute and every car will be
needed

Then Ill take my own car she said Its all ready and has the
chains on sergeant I think

Yes its quite ready but you will get me into trouble miss

Then Ill get you out again Load those things in while I run and
changeIm going to drive you out to your camp she said to Barry as
she hurried away

The sergeant shook his head as he looked after her

Shes a thoroughbred sir he said We jump when she asks us for
anything Shes a real blooded one not like some sirlike some of
them fullrigged ones They keep er oppin

Fullrigged ones inquired Barry

Them nurses I mean sir They loves to awe themthem young
Vaddies as we call themV A D you know sir They keeps em a
oppin properscrubbin floors runnin messages but Miss Vincent
she mostly drives a car

While the sergeant was dilating upon the virtues and excellences of the
young V A D his men ran out her car and packed into it the biscuit
tins and coffee By the time the sergeant was ready she was back
dressed in a chauffeurs uniform

Barry had thought her charming in her V A D dress but in her uniform
she was bewitching He noticed that her hair clustered in tiny ringlets
about her natty little cap in quite a maddening way One vagrant curl
over her ear had a particular fascination for his eyes He felt it ought
to be tucked in just a shade He was conscious of an almost irresistible
desire to do the tucking in What would happen if

Well are you ready inquired the girl in a quick businesslike tone

What Oh yes said Barry recalled to the business of the moment

During the drive the girl gave her whole attention to her wheel as
indeed was necessary for the road was dangerously slippery and she
drove without lights through the black night Barry kept up an endless
stream of talk set going by her command as she took her place at the
wheel Now tell me about Canada I can listen but I cant talk

In the full tide of his most eloquent passages Barry found himself
growing incoherent at times for his mind was in a state of oscillation
between the wonderful and lustrous qualities of the brown eyes that
he remembered flashing upon him in the light of the fire and that
maddening little curl over the girls ear

In an unbelievably short time so it seemed to him they came upon the
rear of a marching column

These are your men I fancy she said and this will be your camp on
the left I know it well Ive often been here

She swung the car off the road into an open field set out with tents
and brought the car to a stop beside an old ruined factory

This I believe will be the best place for your purpose she said
and sprang from her seat and ran to the ruin flashing her torchlight
before her Here you are she said This will be just the thing

Barry followed her a few steps down into the long stoneflagged cellar

Splendid This is the very thing he cried enthusiastically You are
really the most wonderful person

Now get your stuff in here she ordered But what will you do for
wood There is always water she added in some tanks further on
Come Ill show you

Barry followed her in growing amazement and admiration at her prompt
efficiency

Now then there are your tanks she said As for wood I dont know
what you will do but there is a garden paling a little further on and
of course

Dont worry about that said Barry

I wont with a gay laugh I know you Canadians you see

Together they returned to the car

Before she mounted to her seat she turned to Barry and offered him her
hand and said I think it is perfectly ripping that we were introduced
in this way Though I dont know your name yet she added shyly

Awfully stupid of me said Barry and he gave her his name adding
that of the regiment and his rank

Goodbye then she said climbing into her car and starting her
engine

But said Barry I must see you safely back

She laughed a scornful but as Barry thought a most delicious little
laugh

Nonsense We dont do that sort of thing here you know Were on our
own

A little silence fell between them

When does your battalion march she asked abruptly

Perhaps tomorrow I dont know

If you do go then she said with again that little touch of shyness
I suppose I wont see you again

See you again exclaimed Barry his tone indicating that the
possibility of such a calamity was unthinkable why of course I shall
see you again I must see you againIII just must see you again

Good night then she said in a soft hurried voice throwing in her
clutch

Barry stood listening in the dark to the hum of her engine growing more
faint every moment

Some girl eh said a voice At his side he saw Harry Hobbs Barry
turned sharply upon him

Now then Hobbs some wood and we will get a fire going and look
lively And Hobbs I believe theres a fence about fifty yards down
there which you might find useful Now move Quick Unconsciously he
tried to reproduce in uttering the last word Duffs tone and manner
The effect was evident immediately

Hobbs without further words departed in the darkness Again Barry stood
listening to the hum of the engine until he could no longer hear it in
the noise and confusion of the camp but in his heart Harrys words made
music

Some girl eh

As he stood there in the darkness hearing that music in his heart a
voice broke in swearing hard and deep oaths It was the M O

Hello doc my boy come here cried Barry

The M O approached He was in a state of rage that rendered coherent
speech impossible

Oh quit it doc Let me show you something

He led him into the ruin where his spoils were cached

Biscuits my boy and coffee Hold on Listen Im going to get a
fire going here and in twenty minutes therell be six cans of fragrant
delicious coffee boiling hot

Why how the

Doc dont talk Listen to me You round up your sick men and bring
them quietly over here I dont know how many I can supply but at
least I think a hundred

Why how the devil

Go on I havent time to talk to you Get busy

Working by flashlight the men cut open the tins dumped the biscuits
on a blanket spread in a corner of the cellar while Barry made
preparations for a fire

Here Hobbs you punch two holes in these cans just an inch from the
top

Soon the fire was blazing cheerily In its light Barry was searching
through the ruin

By Jove he shouted the very thing Just made for us

He pulled out a long steel rod from a heap of rubbish and ran with it to
the fire

Here boys punch a hole in this wall Now then for the cans String
them on this rod

In twenty minutes the coffee was ready

How is it he inquired anxiously handing a mess tin full to one of
his men

The boy tasted it

Like mother made he said with a grin Gee but its good

At that moment the doctor appeared at the cellar door

I say old chap he said there will be a riot here in fifteen
minutes That coffee smells the whole camp

Bring em along doc The sick chaps first By Jove heres the
sergeant major himself

Whats all this inquired the sergeant major in his gruffest voice
Whos responsible for this fire

Coffee sergeant major answered Barry handing him a tin full

But what

Drink it first sergeant major

The sergeant major took the mess tin and tasted the coffee

Well this IS fine he declared and its what the boys want But
this fire is against orders sir I ought to have it put out

You will have it put out over my dead body sergeant major cried the
M O

And mine added Barry

By gad well chance the zeps sir said the sergeant major This
freezin rain will kill more men than a bomb Bring in your men sir
he added to the M O But I must see the O C

The sergeant majors devotion to military discipline was struggling hard
with his humanity which under his rugged exterior beat warm in his
heart

Why bother with the O C said the M D

But I must see him insisted the sergeant major

He had not far to go to attain his purpose

Hello What the devil is this exclaimed a loud voice at the door

By gad its the old man himself muttered the M O to Barry Now
look out for ructions

In came the O C followed by a brass hat Barry went forward with a
steaming tin of coffee

Sorry our china hasnt arrived yet sir he said cheerfully but the
coffee isnt bad the boys say

Why its you Dunbar said the colonel peering into his face and
shaking the rain drops from his coat I might have guessed that youd
be in it Where theres any trouble he continued turning to the brass
hat at his side you may be quite sure that the Pilot or the M O here
will be in it By Jove this coffee goes to the right spot Have a cup
major he said as Barry brought a second tin

Its against regulations you know said the major taking the mess
tin gingerly Fires are quite forbidden Air raids and that sort of
thing dont you know

Oh hang it all major cried the O C The coffee is fine and my
men will be a lot better for it This camp of yours anyway is no place
for human beings and especially for men straight off the boat As for
me Im devilish glad to get this coffee Give me another tin Pilot

Its quite irregular murmured the major still drinking his coffee
Its quite irregular But I see the door is fairly well guarded against
light and perhaps

I think well just carry on said the colonel If there is any
trouble Ill assume the responsibility for it Thank you Pilot Just
keep guard on the light here sergeant major

All right sir Very good sir we will hang up a blanket

Meanwhile the news had spread throughout the camp and before many
minutes had passed the cellar was jammed with a crowd of men that
reached through the door and out into the night The crowd was becoming
noisy and there was danger of confusion Then the pilot climbed up on a
heap of rubbish and made a little speech

Men he called out this coffee is intended first of all for the sick
men in this battalion Those sick men must first be cared for After
that we shall distribute the coffee as far as it will go There is
plenty of water outside and I think I have plenty of coffee Sergeant
major I suggest that you round up these men in some sort of order

A few sharp words of command from the sergeant major brought order
out of confusion and for two hours there filed through the cellar a
continuous stream of men each bringing an empty mess tin and carrying
it away full of hot and fragrant coffee

By the time the men had been supplied the officers were finished with
their duties and having got word of the Pilots coffee stall came
crowding in One and all they were vociferous in their praise of the
chaplain voting him a good fellow and a lifesaver of the highest
order But it was felt by all that Corporal Thom expressed the general
consensus of opinion to his friend Timms That Pilot of ours he
declared runs a little to the narrow gauge but in that last round up
he was telling us about last Sunday there wont be the goat run for him
Its him for the baa baas sure enough

And though in the vernacular the corporals words did not sound quite
reverent it was agreed that they expressed in an entirely satisfactory
manner the general opinion of the battalion

An hour later wearied as he was Barry crawled into his icy blankets
but with a warmer feeling in his heart than he had known since he joined
the battalion But before he had gone to sleep there came into his mind
a thought that brought him up wide awake He had quite forgotten all
about his duty as chaplain What a chance you had there insisted his
chaplains conscience for a word that would really hearten your men
This is their first night in France Tomorrow they march up to danger
and death What a chance And you missed it

Barry was too weary to discuss the matter further but as he fell asleep
he said to himself At any rate the boys are feeling a lot better
and in spite of his sense of failure that thought brought him no small
comfort



CHAPTER XI

THE NEW MESSAGE


I think said Barry to the M O I really ought to ride down to the
R A M C hospital and tell them how the boys enjoyed the coffee last
night His face was slightly flushed but the flush might have been due
to the fact that he had been busily engaged in tying up the thongs of
his bedroll an awkward job at times

Sure thing agreed the M O heartily Indeed its absolutely
essential and say old chap you might tell her how I enjoyed my
coffee She will be glad to hear about me

Barry heaved his bedroll at the doctor and departed

At the R A M C Hospital the Officer Commanding to whom he had sent
in his card gave him a cordial greeting

I am glad to know you sir We have quite a lot of your chaps here now
and then and fine fellows they seem to be We expect a hospital train
this morning and I understand there are some Canadians among them
Rather a bad go a few days ago at St Eloi Heavy casualty list
Clearing stations all crowded and so they are sending a lot down the
line

Canadians asked Barry thinking of his father You have not heard
what unit sir

No we only get the numbers and the character of the casualties and
that sort of thing Well I must be off Would you care to look around

Thank you no We are also on the march I simply came to tell you how
very greatly our men appreciated your help last night

Oh thats perfectly all right Glad the sergeant had sense enough to
do the right thing

Barry hesitated

May I seeahthe sergeant

The sergeant Why certainly but its not necessary at all

The sergeant was called and duly thanked The R A M C officer was
obviously anxious to be rid of his visitor and to get off to his duty

Still Barry lingered

There was also a young lady sir last night he said at length

A young lady

Sister Vincent sir interjected the sergeant She ran them up to the
camp in her car sir The ambulances and cars were all under orders

Ah Ran you up to the camp eh

Yes she ran us up with the biscuits and coffee It was awfully kind of
her

AhUmVery good Very good Sergeant call her said the O C
abruptly

Im afraid shed be asleep now sir She was on night duty sir

Oh then said Barry please dont disturb her I wouldnt think of
it If you will be kind enough sir to convey the thanks of the men and
of myself to her

Surely surely Well I really must be going Goodbye Good luck

He turned to his motor car I wont forget sir he said to Barry
Oh Ill be sure to tell her he added with a significant smile

As Barry was mounting his horse the strains of the battalion band were
heard floating down the street He drew up his horse beside the entrance
and waited Down the winding hill they came tall lean hardlooking
men striding with the free easy swing of the men of the foothills
Barry felt his heart fill with pride in his comrades

By Jove he said to himself the boys are all right

Fine body of men sir said the sergeant who with his comrades had
gathered about the gateway

Not too bad eh sergeant said Barry with modest pride

Sir said the sergeant in a low voice the young lady is up at the
window to your left

Sergeant youre a brick Thank you said Barry He turned in his
saddle and saw above him a window filled with smiling nurses looking
down at the marching column and among them his friend of the night
before Her face was turned away from him and her eyes were upon the
column eagerly searching the ranks of the marching men

Sergeant said Barry your Commanding Officer is a very busy man and
has a great many things to occupy his attention Dont you think it is
quite possible that that message of mine might escape his memory and
dont you think it would be really more satisfactory if I could deliver
that message in person

The sergeant tilted his hat over one eye and scratched his head

Well sir the Commanding Officer does ave a lot of things to think
about and though he doesnt often forget he might Besides I really
think the young lady would like to know just how the coffee went

Sergeant you are a man of discernment Ill just wait here until the
battalion passes

He moved his horse a few steps out from the gateway and swung him
around so that he stood facing the window The movement caught the
attention of the V A D in the window She glanced down saw him and
leaning far out waved her hand in eager greeting and with a smile of
warm friendliness

He had only time to wave his hand in reply when the head of the column
drew opposite the gateway forcing him to turn his back to the window
and stand at salute

The Commanding Officer acknowledged the salute glanced up at the
window waved his hand to the group of nurses there gathered then
glanced back at Barry with a smile full of meaning and rode on

After the band had passed the entrance it ceased playing and the men
catching sight of Barry and the smiling group at the window above him
broke softly into a rather suggestive music hall ditty at that time
popular with the soldiers


 Hello Hello Whos your lady friend
 Whos the little blossom by your side
 I saw you with a girl or two
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Im surprised at you


Down the length of the column the refrain passed gradually gaining
in strength and volume until by the time the rear came opposite the
entrance the men were shouting with wide open throats


 Oh Oh Oh Oh Im surprised at you


with a growing emphasis and meaning upon every successive Oh

Barrys face was aflame and his heart hot with furious indignation
She was not that kind of a girl She would be humiliated before her
associates He glanced up at the window but she was gone The battalion
marched on but Barry still remained his eyes following the swinging
column his face still flaming and his heart hot with indignation

Good morning Captain Dunbar

He swung off his horse and there smiling at him with warm friendliness
was the little V A D

Im awfully sorry began Barry thinking of the impudent song of his
comrades I mean Im very glad to see you I just ran in to tell you
how splendidly the coffee went last night There are a hundred fellows
marching along there that are fine and fit just because of your
kindness and Im here to give you their thanks

Barry felt that he was cutting a rather poor figure His words came
haltingly and stumblingly The suggestive music hall ditty was still in
his mind

What a splendid band you have she said and how splendidly the men
sing

Sing cried Barry indignantly Oh yes they do sing rather well
dont they he added greatly relieved I have only a minute he
added hurriedly but I wanted to see you again and I wonder if I may
drop you a little note now and then just towell hang it alljust to
keep in touch with you I dont want you to quite forget me

Oh I wont forget you she said The brown eyes looked straight at
him You see after all my uncle knows you so well Indeed he told me
about you You see we really are friends in a way arent we

We are indeed and you are awfully good Goodbye

Goodbye she said and if I leave here soon I promise to let you
know

And Barry rode away his heart in such a turmoil as he had never known
In his ears lingered the music of that soft voice and his eyes saw a
bewildering complexity of dancing ringlets and lustrous glances until
he drew up at the rear of the column and found himself riding once more
beside his friend the M O

Congratulations old man said the doctor Shes a blossom all
right Cheer up you may find her bending over your white face some
day holding your hand or smoothing your brow in the approved V A D
manner

Oh shut up doc said Barry with quite unusual curtness Shes not
that kind of a girl

Ah who knows said the doctor Who knows

At the railway station the battalion was halted awaiting the making
up of their train the departure of which was delayed by the incoming
hospital train from up the line They had not long to wait

Here she is boys called out a soldier And into the station slowly
rolled that hospital train with its freight of wounded men mutilated
maimed broken Its windows were crowded with faces white as their
swathings worn spent deeplined from which looked forth eyes
indifferent staring but undaunted and indomitable

Gradually with stately movement as befitted its noble burden the
train came to rest immediately opposite the battalion With grave
fascinated horrorstricken faces the men of the battalion stood rigid
and voiceless gazing at that deeply moving spectacle Before their eyes
were being paraded the tragic pathetic remnants of a gallant regiment
which but a few weeks before had stood where they now stood vital
with life tingling with courage At their countrys bidding they had
ascended that Holy Mount of Sacrifice to offer upon the altar of the
worlds freedom their bodies as a living sacrifice unto God holy and
acceptable Now their offering being made they were being borne back
helpless bruised shattered but unconquered and eternally glorious

Silently the two companies gazed at each other across the intervening
space Then from the window of the train a soldier thrust a bandaged
head and bandaged arm

Hello there Canada he cried waving the arm Instantly as if he
had touched a hidden spring from the battalions thousand throats there
broke a roar of cheers that seemed to rock the rafters of the station
building

Again again and yet again As if they could never exhaust the burden
of their swelling emotions they roared forth their cheers waving caps
and rifles high in the air while down their cheeks poured unheeded and
unhindered a rain of tears

Canada Canada Canada they cried Oh you Canadians Alberta
Alberta

Feebly came the answering cheers awkwardly waved the bandaged hands and
arms

Then the battalion broke ranks and flinging rifles and kitbags to the
ground they rushed across the tracks eager to bring their tribute of
pride and love to their brothers from their own country far across the
sea

Malcolm Hello Malcolm cried a voice from a window of the train as
the noise had somewhat subsided Hey Malcolm here you are cried a
wounded man raising himself from his cot to the window

Malcolm Innes turned scanned the train then rushed across the tracks
to the window and clung fast to it

It was his brother Ewen

Is it yourself Ewen and are you hurted bad cried the boy all
unconscious of his breaking voice and falling tears They clung together
for some little time in silence

Are you much hurted Ewen Tell me the Gods truth again said
Malcolm

Not much said Ewen True as death Im tellin you My arm is broke
thats all We had a bad time of it but man we gave them hell you
bet Oh it was great

Then again the silence fell between them There seemed to be nothing to
say

Here stand back there You must get back you know men

An N C O of the R A M C tried to push Malcolm back from the
window

Here you go to hell cried Malcolm fiercely Its my brother Ive
got

The N C O widely experienced in these tragic scenes hesitated a
moment An officer coming up behind him with a single glance took in
the situation

My boy he said kindly placing his hand on Malcolms arm we want
to get these poor chaps as soon as possible where they will be
comfortable

Malcolm sprang back at once saluting

Yes sir he said Certainly sir And backing across the tracks
stood looking across at the window from which his brother wearied with
his effort had disappeared

Meantime the R A M C were busy with their work With marvellous
rapidity and speed the train was unloaded of its pathetic freight
the carrying cases into ambulances and the walking cases into cars and
wagons

Goodbye Mac called a voice as a car was driving off It was Ewen
again The wounded man spoke to the driver who immediately pulled up
and swung over to the platform where Malcolm was standing

Oh are you sure Ewen you are goin to be all right Man you look
awful white

All right Mac You bet I will Its only my arm said Ewen his
brave bright words in pathetic contrast to his white face

At this point Barry came rushing along

Why Ewen My poor fellow he cried throwing his arm about the
wounded mans shoulder What is it

My arm sir said the boy adding some words in a low tone But Im
all right he said brightly Youll write my mother sir and tell
her Youll know what to say

Surely I will Youll be all right old boy God bless you Good luck
Ewen

Then leaning over the boy he added in a low voice Remember you are
not all alone God is with you You wont forget that

I wont sir I know it well said Ewen earnestly

Most of the stretcher cases had been hurried away Only a few of the
more seriously wounded remained As Barry turned away from the car he
saw the medical officer and sergeant major approaching him

A terrible business said Barry in a horrorstricken voice Splendid
chaps How plucky they are

The M O made no reply but coming close to Barry he put his arm
through his the sergeant major taking him by the other arm

I say Barry old chap said the M O in a grave voice calling him
for the first time by his first name There is some one here that you
know well

Some one I know said Barry standing still and looking from one to
the other

Ay sir Some one we all know and greatly respect replied the
sergeant major

Notnotoh not my father

The M O nodded

Bad doctor Not dying doctor His face was white even in spite of
his tan His hands closed about the doctors arm in a grip that reached
to the bone

No not dying Barry but in a bad way I fear

Take me muttered Barry in a dazed way and they moved together
rapidly across the platform

Wait a moment doctor said Barry breathing hard

They stood still a silent and sympathetic group of soldiers about them
Barry turned from them walked a few steps his clasped hands writhing
before him then stood with his face uplifted to the sky for a few
moments

All right doctor Ill follow he said coming quietly back Will he
know me

Sure thing sir said the sergeant major cheerily He was asking for
you

On a stretcher waiting to be lifted into the ambulance he found his
father lying white and still

Dad cried Barry dropping to his knees beside him He put his arms
around him on the stretcher and kissed him on both cheeks and on the
lips They all drew back from the stretcher and turned their backs upon
the two

Barry my boy Thank the good God I feared I would not see you Its
all right now Everything is all right now I cant put my arms around
you boy I havent any left

Barrys shudder shook the stretcher

Dad dad oh dad he whispered over and over again

Its all right whispered his father We must not forget were
soldiers Help me to keep up boy Im not very strong

That pitiful word did for Barry what nothing else could do He lifted
his head stood up and drew a deep breath

Sure thing dad he said in a clear steady voice I mustnt keep
you

He motioned to the bearers Then suddenly recollecting that his duty
would call him away from his father he turned to the M O an agony of
supplication in his voice

Oh doctor must I leave him here he asked in a low tone

Just then an orderly came running up to him and saluting said

Sir the Commanding Officer says you are to remain behind with your
fathertilltill

Until you are sent for said the M O I will see to that

Wheres the Commanding Officer cried Barry starting forward

He has gone off somewheres sir He was sorry he couldnt come himself
but he was called away He sent that message to you

Doctor will you remember to thank the Commanding Officer for me he
said briefly and turned to follow his father into the ambulance which
he discovered to be in charge of his friend the sergeant of the R A
M C

At the hospital he was received with every mark of solicitous care He
was made to feel that he was among friends

How long doctor he asked after the doctor had finished his
examination

Not long Im afraid A few hours perhaps a day He will not suffer
though said the doctor But he added taking Barry by the arm he
is very weak remember and must not be excited

I know doctor said Barry quietly I wont worry him

Through the morning Barry sat by his fathers cot giving him under
the directions of the nurse such stimulants as he needed now and then
speaking a quiet cheery word

Often his father opened his eyes and smiled at him

Good to see you there my boy That was my only grief I feared I might
not see you again Thank the good God that he allowed me to see you

He is good dad isnt He Good to me good to us both

Yes He is good said his father and fell asleep For almost two
hours he slept a sleep of exhaustion due to the terrific strain of the
past fortyeight hours and woke refreshed calm and strong

You are a lot better dad said Barry I believe you are going to
pull through eh

A lot better Barry said his father but my boy we are soldiers
you and I I shall not be long but remember we are soldiers

All right dad Ill try to play the game

Thats the word Barry We must play the game and by Gods grace we
will you and Iour last game together

Through the afternoon they talked between intervals of sleep resolved
each to help the other in playing to the end in the manner of British
soldiers that last great game

They talked of course of home and their happy days together going far
back into the earlier years of struggle on the ranch

Hard days Barry they were but your mother never failed me Wonderful
courage she had and if we were all right you and I Barry she was
always happy Do you remember her

Yes dad quite well I remember her smiling always

Smiling my God Smiling through those days Yes thats the way she
played the game and thats the only way boy

Yes dad said Barry and his smile was brighter than ever but his
knuckles showed white where he gripped the chair

The nurse came and went wondering at their bright faces and their
cheery voices They kept their minds upon the old happy days They
recalled their canoe trips their hunting experiences dwelling mostly
upon the humorous incidents playing the game Of the war they spoke
little not at all of what was to be afterthe past the golden happy
past rich in love and in comradeship that was their one theme

As night fell the father grew weary and his periods of sleep grew
longer but ever as he woke he found his sons face smiling down upon
him

Good boy Barry he said once with an understanding look and an
answering smile Dont try too hard my boy

Its all right dad I assure you its all right You know it is

I know I know my boy he said and fell asleep again

As the midnight hour drew on Barrys head from sheer weariness sunk
upon his breast In his sleep he became aware of some one near him He
sat up dazed and stupid from his exhaustion and his grief and found a
nurse at his side

Take this she said softly You will need it She set a tray at his
side

Oh thank you no he said I cant eat I cant touch anything

You need it said the nurse You must take it for his sake you
know He will need you

Her voice aroused him He glanced at her face

Oh its you he cried

It was the little V A D

Dont rise she said putting her hand on his shoulder and pointing
to his father Drink this first She handed him an eggnog Now
take your tea There was a quiet authority about her that compelled
obedience He ate in silence while she stood beside him He was too
weary and too sick at heart to talk but he gradually became aware that
the overpowering sense of loneliness that had been with him all day was
gone

When he had finished his slight meal he whispered to her

I wish I could thank you but I cant I did need it You have helped
me greatly

You are better now she said softly Its very very hard for you so
far from home and from all your friends

There is no one else said Barry simply We have no one but just
ourselves

At this point his father opened his eyes bright and very wideawake

The V A D began to gather up the tea things Barry put out his hand
and touched her arm

Dad this is your night nurse She was very kind to me last night and
again tonight This is Miss Vincent

The brightness of the V A Ds smile outshone his own

Im not a real nurse she said Im only a V A D you know They
use me to wash the floors and dishes and for all sorts of odd jobs
Tonight they are shorthanded and have put me on this duty

While she was speaking she continued to smile a smile of radiant cheer
and courage

The wounded man listened gravely to her his eyes searching her face
her eyes her very soul it seemed to her In spite of her experience
and her selfcontrol she felt her face flushing under his searching
gaze

My dear he said at length I am glad to meet you You are a good and
brave girl I know His eyes fell upon the black band upon her arm I
see you are wearing the badge of heroism My dear pardon me you
have the same lookBarry she has your dear mothers look not so
beautifulyou will forgive me my dearbut the same look She thinks
of others and she has courage to suffer My dear I cannot take your
hands in minehe glanced with a pathetic smile at his bandaged arms
but with a swift movement of indescribable grace the girl stooped and
kissed him on the forehead

Barry he said turning to his son that was a fine courtesy I count
it an honour to have known you Miss Vincent

He paused a moment or two his searching eyes still upon her face

You will befriend my boy afterafter

I will try my best sir said the girl the colour deepening in her
cheeks the while Good night sir she said I shall be near at hand
if I am wanted

Barry said his father after the girl had gone that is a very
charming and a very superior young lady one you will be glad to know

Yes dad I am sure she is said Barry and then he told his father of
the events of the previous night

For some moments after he had finished his father lay with his eyes
shut and quite still and Barry thinking he slept sat watching his
eyes intent upon the face he loved best in all the world

But his father was not asleep

Yes Barry he said she is like your dear mother and now he added
hurriedly I hope you will not think I am taking a liberty

Oh dad I implore you said Barry

Barry I would like to speak to you about your work

Barry shook his head sadly

Im not much good dad he said but Im not going to quit he added
quickly noting a shadow on his fathers face

Barry Im going to say something to you which I do hope will not hurt
you I know the common soldier better than you do boy Our Canadian
soldiers do not like to be rebuked criticised or even watched too
closely Forgive me this my boy

Oh dad please tell me all that is in your heart

Thank you Barry They dont like the chaplain to be a censor over
their words

I loathe it said Barry passionately

Believe me they are good chaps in their hearts They swear and all
that but that is merely a habit or a mere expression of high emotion
You ought to hear them as they go over Barry let all that pass and
remember that these boys are giving their livestheir lives Barry for
right for conscience and ultimately though it may be unconsciously
for God Barry a man that is giving his life for God may say what he
likes Dont be too hard on them but recall to mind Barry that when
they go up the line they feel terribly lonely and terribly afraid and
that is a truly awful experience

He paused a moment or two and then lowered his voice and continued
Barry you wont be ashamed of me I was terribly afraid myself

Barry choked back a convulsive sob

You dad you He laughed scornfully

I didnt run Barry thank God But the boysmy boysthey are only
lads many of themlonely and afraidand they must go on They must
go on Oh Barry in that hour they need some one to go with them They
need God

His son was listening with his heart in his eyes He was getting a new
view of the soldier and of the soldiers needs

Unhappily continued his father God is at best a shadowy being to
many of them a stranger to some a terror Barry he said they need
some one to tell them the truth about God Its not fair to God you
know Here again his father paused and then said very humbly I think
I may say Barry I know God now as I did not before And you helped
me boy to know him

Oh dad cried Barry passionately Not I I dont know Him at all

Let me tell you how you helped me Barry Before I went up the last
time I wanted

He paused abruptly his face working and his lip quivering

Forgive me my boy Im a little weak

A few moments of silence and then he continued quietly

I wanted you Barry

The boys hands were writhing under his knees but his face and eyes
were quite steady

I was terribly lonely I thought of that strange dear bond that held
us together and then like a flash out of the sky came those great
words Like as a father pitieth his children and oh boy boy It
came to me then that as I feel toward my boy God feels toward me Barry
listen His voice fell to a whisper I am Gods son as you are
mine There was no more fear and I was not nearly so lonely Tell the
boystell the boys the truth about God

He lay a long time silent with his eyes closed and as Barry watched
he saw two tears fall down the white cheeks It was to him a terrible
sight Never not even at his mothers grave had he seen his fathers
tears It was more than he could endure He put his face down beside his
fathers on the pillow

Dad I understand he whispered I know now what God is like He is
like you dad He gave himself for us as you dad have given yourself
all these years for me

He was sobbing but very quietly

Forgive me dad Im not crying Im just thinking about God and you
Oh dad you are both wonderful Wonderful

Barry my boy tell them Dont worry yourself about them Just tell
them about God He is responsible for them not you

Oh I will dad I promise you I will Ive been all wrong but Ill
tell them Ill tell them

Thank God my boy said his father with a deep sigh Now Im tired
Say Our Father

Together they whispered those greatest of words in human speech those
words that have bound heaven to earth in yearning and in hope for these
two thousand years

Dont move Barry whispered his father I like you there

With their faces thus together they fell asleep

Barry was awakened by his fathers voice clear and strong

Are you there Barry it said

Here dad right here

Good boy Good boy You wont leave me Barry I mean you dont need to
go

No dad Ill never leave you

Good boy again murmured his father softly Always a good boy
always always

He was breathing heavily long deep breaths

Lift me up Barry he said

Barry sat on the bed put his arm around his fathers shoulders and
lifted him up

Thats betterhold me closer BarryYou wont hurt meOh its
goodto feelyour armsstrong armsBarry

You made them strong dad said Barry in a clear steady voice

The father nestled his head upon his sons shoulder

Barry he said in the low tone of one giving a confidence dont
ever forgetto thank Godfor these eighteen yearstogetherYou saved

Barry kissed him on the lips

SoGoodnight

A deep breath he took anotherBarry waited for the next but there was
not another

He laid his father down and looked into his quiet face touched even
now with the noble stateliness of death He put his arms about the
unresponsive form and his face to the cheek still warm

Dad oh dad he whispered Do you knowdo you knowOh God tell
him how I love him Tell him Tell him I never could

The little V A D came softly and stood looking from a distance Then
coming to the bedside she laid her hand upon the head and then the
heart of the dead man Then she drew back and beckoning to an orderly
they placed a screen about the cot She let her eyes rest for a moment
or two upon the kneeling boy then went softly away

Death was to her an all too familiar thing She had often seen it
unmoved but tonight as she walked away the brown eyes could not hold
their tears



CHAPTER XII

A MAN OF GOD


Barry was standing beside his fathers grave in a little plot in the
Boulogne cemetery set apart for British officers They had one by one
gone away and left him until alone he stood looking down on the simple
wooden cross on which were recorded the name age and unit of the
soldier with the date of his death and underneath the simple legend
eloquent of heroic sacrifice Died of wounds received in action

Throughout the simple beautiful burial service he had not been acutely
conscious of grief Even now he wondered that he could shed no tears
Rather did an exultant emotion fill his soul as he looked around upon
the little British plot with its rows of crosses and he was chiefly
conscious of a solemn tender pride that he was permitted to share that
glorious offering which his Empire was making for the saving of the
world But in this moment as he stood there alone close to his
fathers grave and surrounded by those examples of high courage and
devotion he became aware of a mighty change wrought in him during these
last three days He had experienced a veritable emancipation of soul He
was as if he had been born anew

The old sense of failure in his work the feeling of unfitness for it
and the old dread of it had been lifted out of his soul and not only
was he a new man but he felt himself to be charged with a new mission
because he had a new message for his men No longer did he conceive
himself as a moral policeman or religious censor whose main duty it
was to stand in judgment over the faults and sins of the men of
his battalion No more would the burden of his message be a stern
denunciation of these faults and sins Standing there today he could
only wonder at his former blindness and stupidity and pride

Who am I he said in bitter selfhumiliation that I should judge my
comrades How little I knew myself

A man of God his superintendent had said in his last letter to him
Yes truly a man of God A MAN not God A MAN not to sit in Gods place
in judgment upon his fellow sinners but to show them God their Father

Barry thought of the frequent rebukes he had administered to the
officers and men for what he considered to be their sins He groaned
aloud

God will forgive me I know he said But will they

He tried to recall what the burden of his message to his battalion
had been during these past months but to him there came no clear and
distinct memory of aught but warnings and denunciations with reference
to what he judged to be faulty in their conduct Today it seemed to him
both sad and terrible

How had he so failed and so misconceived the Masters plain teaching He
moved among sinners all His days not with denunciations in His heart or
voice but only with pity and love

Be not anxious He had said Consider the birds of the air Not
one of them falleth to the ground without your Father How much more
precious are you than the birds

What a message for men going up to face the terrors and perils of the
front line Be not anxious

I was afraid his father had said to him That to him was
inconceivable That that gallant spirit should know terror seemed to
him impossible Yet even he had said I was afraid And for the
loneliness what a message he now had In their loneliness men cried out
for the presence of a friend and the Master had said

When ye pray pray to your Father Your Father knoweth When ye pray
say Our Father And he had missed all this What a mess he had made
of his work How sadly misread his Masters teaching and misinterpreted
his Masters spirit

Barry looked down upon the grave at his feet

But you knew dad you knew he whispered

For the first time since he had become a chaplain he thought of his
work with gratitude and eagerness He longed to see his men again He
had something to tell them It was this that God to them was like their
fathers their mothers their brothers their friends only infinitely
more loving and without their faults

With his head high and his feet light upon the earth he returned to the
R A M C Hospital where he found Harry Hobbs with his handbag and a
letter from his O C

Take a few days off said the O C We all sympathise with you
We miss you and shall be glad to see you but take a few days now for
yourself

Barry was greatly touched but he had only one desire now and that was
to return to his unit His batman brought him also an order from
the Assistant Director of Chaplain Service bidding him report at the
earliest moment

At Headquarters he learned that the A D C S had been in Boulogne
but had gone to Etaples some thirty or forty miles distant to visit
the large hospitals there He determined that tomorrow he would go to
Etaples and report after which he would proceed to his battalion

That evening he visited the men in the hospital coming upon many
Canadians whose joy in seeing a chaplain from their own country touched
Barry to the heart He took their messages which he promised to transmit
to their folks at home and left with them something of the serene and
exultant peace that filled his own soul

From Ewen Innes and others of the Wapiti draft he learned something
of his fathers work and place in their battalion Soldiers are not
eloquent in speech but mostly in silence Their words halted when they
came to speak of their sergeant majors soldierly qualitiesfor his
father had become the sergeant major of the battalionhis patience his
skill his courage

He knew his job sir said one of them He was always onto it

It was his care of his men that we thought most of said Ewen who
continued to relate incidents that had come under his own observation of
this characteristic tears the while flowing down his cheeks

He never thought of himself sir It was our comfort first He was far
more than our sergeant major He watched us like a father thats what
he did

As Barry listened to the soldiers telling of his father in broken words
and with flowing tears he almost wondered at them for their tears and
wondered at himself that he had none Tears seemed to be so much out of
place in telling such a tale as that

The train for Etaples leaving at an unearthly hour in the morning Barry
went to take farewell of the V A D the night before

That is an awfully early hour she said and oh such a wretched
train There was in her voice an almost maternal solicitude for his
comfort

Thats nothing said Barry When I see you here at your unending
work it makes me feel more and more like a slacker

Wait for me here a moment she said and hurried away to return
shortly in such a glow of excitement as even her wonted calm and
selfrestraint could not quite hide

Im going to drive you to Etaples tomorrow in my car I know the
matron and some of the nurses in the American hospital there

You dont mean it said Barry but are you sure its not a terrible
bore for you I am much afraid that I have been a nuisance to you and
you have been so very very good to me

A bore she cried and the brown eyes were wide open in surprise A
bore and you a Canadian Why you are one of my brothers friends
and besides you seem to me a friend of our family My uncle Howard you
know told me all about you Besides she added in a voice of great
gentleness you remember I promised

Barry caught her hand

I wish I could tell you all I feel about it but somehow I cant get
the words

She allowed her hand to remain in his for a moment or two then
withdrawing it said hurriedly with a slight colour showing in her
cheeks

I think I understand Then changing her tone abruptly and dropping
into the businesslike manner of a V A D she said So well go
tomorrow It will be a splendid run if the day is fine We had better
start by nine oclock to give us a long day Then as if forgetting she
was a V A D she added with a little catch in her voice Oh I shall
love it

The day proved to be fineone of those golden days of spring that have
given to the land its name of sunny France It was a day for life and
youth and hope A day on which war seemed more than ever a cruel outrage
upon humanity But across the sunniest days across the shining face of
France and across their spirits too the war cast its black shadow
They both however seemed to have resolved that for that day at least
they would turn their eyes from that shadow and let them rest only where
the sun was shining

The V A D with her mind intent upon her wheel could only contribute
as her share in the conversation descriptive and somewhat desultory
comments upon points of interest along the way Barry because it
harmonised with his mood talked about his father and all their years
together but ever without obtrusion of his grief The experiences of
the past three days which they had shared seemed to have established
between them a sense of mutual confidence and comradeship such as in
ordinary circumstances would have demanded years of companionship to
effect This sense of sympathy and of perfect understanding on the part
of the girl at his side together with the fascinating charm of her
beauty and her sweetness was to Barrys stricken heart like a healing
balm to an aching wound

They were in sight of Etaples before Barry imagined they could have made
more than half the journey

Etaples so soon It cannot be

But it is said the girl throwing a bright smile at him and thats
the hospital on the hill yonder where the flag is flying

Why exclaimed Barry thats the American flag Whats the American
flag doing there

Its flying over an American hospital said the V A D I think its
such a beautiful flag In the breeze it seems to me the most beautiful
of all the flags The stripes seem to flow out from the stars Of
course she added hurriedly the Union Jack with all its historic
meaning and its mingled crosses is splendidly glorious and is more
decorative but I always think when I see those floating stripes that
the Americans have the most beautiful flag

I admit said Barry its a beautiful flag butwell Im a
Britisher I suppose and see it with British eyes But why is that flag
flying here in France How do the authorities allow that Its a neutral
flagawfully neutral too

I understand they have permission from the French authorities to fly
that flag over every American institution in France And you know
continued the girl with rising enthusiasm if they are neutral they
have immensely helped us too havent theyin munitions and that sort
of thing

Thats true enough agreed Barry and its all the more wonderful
when you think of the millions of Germans that they have in their
country I heard a very fine thing not long ago from a friend of
mine A Pittsburgh oil man about to close a deal with a traveller
with millions in it suddenly discovered that his oil was to go to
the Germans At once the deal was off and though the price was
considerably raised there was in his own words Nothing doing No
stuff of mine he said shall go to help an enemy of the AngloSaxon
race Thats the way I believe the real Americans feel

This is a wonderful hospital said the V A D Whenever I see it I
somehow feel my heart grow warm to the American people for the splendid
way in which they have helped poor France for you know in the first
months of the war the French hospitals were perfectly ghastly

I know I know cried Barry And the Canadians too have chipped in
a bit We have a Canadian hospital in Paris for the French and others
are being organised

They turned in at the gate and found themselves in a beautiful
quadrangle set out with grass plots and flowers and cement walks The
building itself an ancient royal palace had been enlarged by means of
sunparlours and porches which gave it an air of wonderful cheeriness
and brightness

I will run in and see if any of my friends are about said the V A
D Wait here for me Unless you care to come in she added

No I will wait here I dont just feel like meeting strangers but
if there are Canadians in the hospital I should like to see them
And perhaps you can discover where my chief can be found if you dont
mind

Hardly had she passed within the door when another car came swiftly to
the gate and drew up a little in front of Barrys A girl leaped from
the wheel and with a spring in her step which spoke of a bounding
vitality ran up the steps

What thought caught her it is difficult to say but on the topmost step
she spun around and looked straight into Barrys eyes

Paula he shouted and was out of the car and at the foot of the
steps with hand outstretched when with a single touch of her foot to
the steps she was at him with both hands reaching for his

Barry oh Barry It cant be you she panted Her face went red then
white then red again Oh its better than a drink to see you Whence
how why whither Oh never mind answering she went on Its enough
to see you

A step behind her diverted her attention from Barry Barry ran up the
steps and taking the V A D by the hand led her down

I want you to meet a friend of mine he said and introduced Paula

Paulas eyes keen as a knifepoint were upon the V A Ds face

Im glad to know you she said frankly offering her hand
Principally she added with a little laugh because you know Barry

The V A D bowed with the slight reserve characteristic of her and
took Paulas hand

I too am pleased she said to meet a friend of Captain Dunbar
Then she added with increased cordiality and Im glad to meet an
American in France I know your matron and some of the nurses

Good cried Paula Now then youll both of you take lunch with me

The V A D demurred

Of course you will cried Paula Oh Barry Im just ready to die
from seeing you again Come along she cried impulsively catching
the V A D by the arm Come along and park your buzzwagon here beside
mine

She ran to her car sprang in and whirled it into place before the V A
D had hers well started

Barry waited where they had left him The sudden appearing of Paula had
stirred within him depths of feeling that almost overpowered him His
mind was far away in Athabasca once more he was seeing the dark pool
the swiftly flowing water the campfire and his father bending over it
His heart was quivering as if a hand had been rudely thrust into a raw
wound in it

The V A D held Paula a few moments beside her car speaking quickly
and earnestly When they rejoined Barry Paulas eyes were soft with
unshed tears and her voice was very gentle

I know Barry she said Miss Vincent just told me Oh what terrible
changes this war brings to us all We see so many sad things here every
day Its terribly sad for you Barry

Yes it is sad Paula and it is going to be lonely You have brought
back to me that bright day on the Athabasca But he added earnestly
after all in this war everything personal is so small Besides he was
so splendid you know and the boys told me he played the game up there
right to the end So Im not going to shame him at least Im trying
not to

But bright as was Barrys smile Paula caught the quivering of his lips
and turned quickly away from him

After a moment or two of silence she cried with her old impulsiveness
Now you will both lunch with me Im the quartermaster of this outfit
and have a small parlour of my own We shall have a lovely cosy time
just Miss Vincent you and myself together

But replied the V A D I have just arranged with the matron to
lunch with her

Oh rubbish Ill cut that out all right Whats the use of being
quartermaster if I cant arrange a lunch party to suit myself

Still the V A D demurred With her breaking an engagement for lunch
was a serious affairwas indeed taking a liberty which no English girl
would think of doing

Oh thats nonsense cried Paula Ill make it perfectly all right
Look here she cried wheeling upon the V A D you Britishers
are so terribly correct Ill show you a little shirtsleeve diplomacy
Besides if you dont come in on this you can have the matron and Ill
take Barry she said with a threatening smile Watch me she added
as she ran away

What a splendid girl said the V A D And that captivating American
way she has Perfectly ripping I call it I do hope we shall be
friends

In a short time Paula came rushing back into the room announcing
triumphantly that arrangements had been made according to her programme
with the matron in hearty accord

And she sends her love she said to the V A D She would not have
you on any account miss this party She is desperately grieved that she
cannot accept my invitation to join us Of course I knew the old dear
couldnt And we are to meet her afterwards

The little lunch party was on the whole a success To the conversation
Paula contributed the larger part Barry doing his best to second her
But in spite of his heroic efforts his mind would escape him far away
to the sunny Athabasca plains and the gleaming river and the smooth
slipping canoe and then with swift transition to the little British
plot in the cemetery at Boulogne

At such times Paula reading his face would momentarily falter in
her gay talk only to begin again with renewed vivacity On one topic
however she had no difficulty in holding Barrys attention It was when
she told of the organising and despatching of the American Red Cross
units to France and more especially of her own unit organised and
financed by her father

I am awfully sorry he is not here today He would have loved to have
seen you again Barry

And I to have seen him said Barry He is a big man and it is
fine of him to do this thing Its just like the big generoushearted
Americansthey are so unstinted in their sympathies and they back them
up for all they are worth

And how efficient they are added the V A D in warm admiration
This hospital you know turning to Barry is perfectly wonderful
Its equipment Its appliances I have often heard our O C speak in the
most rapturous envy of the Etaples American Red Cross unit

And why should not it be cried Paula Its a question of money after
all We are not at war We put in a few little hospitals here in France
We have more money thrown at us than we can use And you talk about
efficiency she added turning to the V A D Good Lord My pater has
just come back from London where he was rubbering around with lords and
dukes and things in a disgustingly unAmerican way I told him and now
he raves from morning until night over the efficiency of the British
Hes been allowed to see some of their munition works you know I
simply had to declaim the American Declaration of Independence to him
three times a day to revive his drooping Democratic sentiments and I
had to sew Old Glory on to his pajamas so that he might dream proper
American dreams No to tell you the truth here Paulas voice took
a deeper note every last American of us here in France is hot with
humiliation and rage at his countrys attitudemonkeying with those
babykilling womanraping devils

As she ended her voice shook with passion her cheeks were pale and in
her eyes shone two bright tears Impulsively the V A D rose from her
place ran around to Paula and putting her arm around her neck said

Oh I do thank you and I love you for your words while Barry stood
at attention as if in the presence of his superior officer I salute
you he said with grave earnestness You worthily represent your brave
and generous people

Oh darn it all cried Paula brushing away her tears Im a fool
but you dont know how we Americans feelreal Americans I mean not
the yellow hyphenated breed

After lunch Barry went to look up his chief the assistant director of
chaplain service while Paula took charge of the V A D saying

Run away Barry and see your Brass Hat Ill show Miss Vincent how a
quartermasters department of a real hospital should be run

His hour with the A D C S was a most stimulating experience for
Barry He found himself at once in touch with not an official thinking
in terms of military regulations and etiquette but a soldier and a man
For the A D C S was both Through all the terrible days at Ypres
where the Canadians in that welter of gas and fire and blood had won
their imperishable fame as fighting men he had been with them sharing
their dangers and ministering to their wants with his brother officers
of the fighting line Physically an unimpressive figure small and
slight yet he seemed charged with concentrated energy waiting release

As Barry listened to his words coming forth in snappy jerking phrases
he was fascinated by the bulldog jaw and piercing eyes of the little
man In brief comprehensive vigorous sentences he set forth his
ideals for the chaplain service in the Canadian army

Three things he said I tell my men should mark the Canadian
chaplain service The first Unityunity among themselves unity
with the other departments of the army Two words describe our
chaplainsChristian and Canadians I am an Anglican myself but on this
side of the channel there are no Anglican no Presbyterian no Methodist
chaplains only Christian and Canadian chaplains I have had to fight
for this with high officials both in the army and in the church I have
won out and while Im here this will be maintained The second thing is
Spirituality The Chaplain must be a Christian man living in touch with
the Divinealive toward God Third Humanity He must be touched
with the feeling of our infirmity sharing the experiences of the men
getting to know their feelings their fears their loneliness their
misery their anxieties and God knows they have their anxieties for
themselves and for their folks at home

As Barry listened he heard again his fathers voice They need you
They are afraid They are lonely They need God

And remember said the A D C S as he rose to close the interview
that I am at your back If you have any difficulty let me know If you
are wrong I promise to tell you If you are right Ill back you up
Now let us go and look over the hospital There are some of our fellows
there If you feel like saying anything in the convalescent ward all
right but dont let it worry you

As they went through the wards Barry could not but notice how the faces
of the patients brightened as his chief approached and how their eyes
followed him after he had passed

They moved slowly through those long corridors sanctified by the
sufferings and griefs and hidden tears of homesick and homelonging men
to many of whom it seemed that the best of life was past

When they had gone the length of the convalescent ward the A D C
S turned and after getting permission of the medical superintendent
briefly introduced Barry to the wounded men as a man from the wild and
woolly Canadian west on his way up the line and therefore competent to
tell us about the war and especially when it will end

Beside them stood a piano and on it lay a violin in its open case
Barry took up the violin fingered its strings in an absentminded way
and said

I dont know anything about the war men but I do know when it
will end and that is when we lick those Huns good and plenty as our
American friends would say bowing to the doctor at his side Im an
awfully poor speaker boys he continued in a confidential tone but I
can make this thing talk a bit

Without further preface he began to play He had not held a violin in
his hands since he had played with his father at home Unconsciously his
fingers wandered into the familiar notes of Handels Largo He found the
violin to possess an exceptionally rich and pure quality of tone

As he began to play a door opened behind them admitting Paula the
V A D and two or three young doctors who took their places in the
corner about the piano

Do you know this whispered Paula to the V A D as she caught the
strains of the Largo

Yes I used to play it with my brother

Go to it then said Paula

But the V A D hesitated

Go on Look at the boys and look at his face

The V A D glanced about the room at the lines of pale and patient
faces which in spite of the marks of pain were so pathetically and
resolutely bright Then she glanced at Barrys face He had forgotten
all about his surroundings and his face was illumined with the light
from those hidden lamps that burn deep in the soul of genius a light
enriched and warmed by the glow of a heart in sympathy with its kind

In obedience to Paulas command and a little push upon her shoulder the
V A D sat down at the piano and touched the notes softly feeling for
the key then fell in with the violin

At the first note Barry turned sharply about and as she found her key
and began to follow he stepped back to her side Immediately from his
instrument there seemed to flow a richer fuller stream of melody From
the solemn and stately harmonies of the Largo he passed to those old
familiar airs that never die and never lose their power over the human
heartAnnie Laurie and Ben Bolt and thence to a rollicking French
chanson which rather bowled over his accompanist but only for the
first time though for she had the rare gift of improvisation and
sympathetic accompaniment

Then with a full arm bowing he swept them into the fiercely majestic
strains of the Marseillaise bringing the bluecoated orderlies about
the door and such patients as could stand and the group about the
piano to rigid attention From the Marseillaise it was easy to pass
into the noble simplicity of his own national song Oh Canada
where again his accompanist was quite able to follow and thence to the
Empires National Anthem which had for a hundred years or more lifted
to their feet British soldiers and sailors the world over

As he drew his bow over the last chord Paula stepped to his side and
whispered in his ear

Wheres America in this thing

Without an instants break in the music he dropped into a whimsical and
really humorous rendering of Yankee Doodle Quickly the V A D moved
from the stool caught Paula and thrust her into the vacant place Then
together the violin and piano rattled into a fantastic and brilliant
variation of that famous and trifling air Again with a sudden change
of mood Barry swung into that old song of the homesick plantation
negro The Suwanee Rivera simple enough air but under the
manipulations of a master lending itself to an interpretation of the
deep and tender emotions which in that room and in that company of
French British Canadian American folk were throbbing in a common
longing for the old home and the old folks at home Before he had
played the air once through the greyhaired American doctor was openly
wiping his eyes and his colleagues looking away from each other
ashamed of the tears that did them only honour

Paulas flushed face and flashing eyes were eloquent of her deep
emotion while at her side the V A D stood quiet controlled but
with a glow of tender feeling shining in her face and in her soft brown
eyes

Not long did Barry linger amid those deeps of emotion but straightening
his figure to its full height and throwing up his head he in full
octaves played the opening bars of what has come to be known as
Americas national anthem The Star Spangled Banner

Instantly the A D C S the orderlies about the door the wounded
French British and Canadian soldiers that could stand sprang
to attention and so remained while the violin with its piano
accompaniment throbbed forth the sonorous chords With the last bar
Barry dropped his bow to his side but held the violin still at his
chin Not one of that company moved but stood with their eyes fastened
upon his face After a moments pause he quietly lifted his bow again
and on the silence still throbbing to the strains of that triumphant
martial air there stole out pure sweet as from some ethereal source
the long drawn trembling notes of that old sacred melody which
sounding over men and women in their hours of terror and anguish and
despair has lifted them to peace and comfort and hopeNearer My God
to Thee

The tension which had held the company was relaxed the wounded men sank
to their seats the A D C S removed his hat which according to
military regulations he had worn to this moment On all sides heads
dropped in an attitude of reverence and so continued until Barry had
drawn the last deep vibrating note to a close

When he had laid his violin in its case the old American doctor came
forward with his hand extended

Let me as an American and a Christian thank you sir he said

One by one the group of Americans came to shake hands with him the last
being Paula who held his hand a moment and said softly

Thank you Barry I believe all that stuff now I have learned it
here

The last of all to come was the V A D Shyly with a smile radiant
through her tears she offered her hand saying Thank you He would
have liked that I know

Captain Dunbar wheres your own violin The abrupt tone of the A D
C S startled them all

At home sir I didnt think a chaplain would need one

Whose violin in this asked the A D C S in his brusque manner

I rather think this is mine said one of the doctors

Will you sell it Ill buy it from you at any price you say I want it
for him

You cant buy it colonel said the doctor Its his now I never
knew it had all that heart stuff in it

He took up the violin and handed it to Barry But Barry drew back in
astonishment Then the old doctor came forward

No Travis he said well do better than that What did your fiddle
cost

A hundred and fifty dollars I think

Travis this company of Americans representing their country here in
France as a token of their sympathy with the allies and their sacred
cause and of gratitude to you sir bowing to Barry will buy this
instrument and present it to this young man on condition that he repeat
in similar circumstances the service he has rendered this afternoon Am
I right he asked looking about him

You bet you are Right you are said the doctors

Oh doctor you are a dear old thing exclaimed Paula

Barry stood holding the instrument in his hand unable to find his
voice The A D C S came to his aid

In the name of my chaplain and in the name of thousands of Canadian
soldiers to whom I promise you he will bring the blessing that he has
brought us this afternoon I thank you for this very beautiful and very
characteristic American act

Well said the old doctor I dont know how you folks feel but I
feel as if I had been to church

Now sir said the A D C S to Barry in his military tone I am
organising a company of musicians who will go through our camps and help
the boys as you have helped us today I would like you to be one of
them What do you say

Oh sir exclaimed Barry hastily laying the violin upon the piano and
standing back from it dont make that an order sir I want to stay
with my men

His face was quivering with deep emotion The A D C S looked into
the quivering face

All right Dunbar he said with a little laugh and putting his hand
on Barrys shoulder I guess you are all right

Some boy What said the American doctor Here I think you had better
take your fiddle along handing Barry the violin It doesnt belong to
any one in this bunch

The burst of laughter that followed all out of proportion to the humour
of the remark revealed the tensity of the strain through which they had
passed

Through the little town of Etaples they drove together in almost
complete silence until they had emerged into the country lying spread
out about them in all the tender beauty of the soft spring evening As
the car moved through the sweet silence of the open fields the V A D
said softly

Oh Captain Dunbar I

My name is Barry he said gently

A quick flush came into the beautiful face and a soft light to the brown
eyes as she answered

And mine is Phyllis Then she hurried to add I was going to say
that you helped me this afternoon as nothing has since my dear brothers
went

Thank you Phyllis What you have been to me through all these days I
wish I could tell but I cant find words

Then they rode together in silence that was more eloquent than any words
of theirs could be At length Barry burst forth enthusiastically

Those Americans What a beautiful and gracious act of kindness that was
to me

Oh replied Phyllis with answering enthusiasm arent they fine
That was perfectly ripping of them



CHAPTER XIII

INTENSIVE TRAINING


Barrys return to the battalion was like a coming home In the mess
there was no demonstration of sympathy with him in his loss but the
officers took occasion to drop in casually with an interesting bit of
news seeking to express more or less awkwardly by their presence what
they found it impossible to express in actual words

It was to Barry an experience as new as it was delightful Hitherto
as far as any real fellowship was concerned he had lived a life of
comparative isolation among his fellow officers and while they were
careful to preserve the conventions and courtesies imposed by their
mutual relations he had ever been made to feel that in that circle he
was an outsider

Among the officers who came to call upon him none surprised him more
than did Major Bayne While that officer had always been careful to
maintain an attitude toward him at once correct and civil there had
never been any approach to friendliness As a matter of fact Major
Bayne was too entirely occupied with his own interests to have either
the leisure or the inclination for anything but a casual concern for the
chaplain and his affairs That was not to be wondered at Life in the
army notwithstanding all its loyalties and its fine unselfishnesses
is in some of its phases a brutally selfcentred form of existence
Its routine consists in the continual performance of duties under an
authority ruthless in its exactions and relentless in its penalties
Only after months of experience of its iron rigidity does the civilian
accustomed as he is to selfdetermination with a somewhat easygoing
regard for the conventions of his community arrive at the state of mind
in which unconsciously and as a matter of second nature he estimates the
quality of the most trivial act by its relation to the standard set by
the Military High Command Like a spectre does that solemn impalpable
often perfectly unreasonable omniscient and omnipotent entity lurk in
the shadow ready to reach out a clutching hand and for some infraction
of regulations wilful or inadvertent hale the luckless and shivering
defaulter to judgment It therefore behooves a man to take heed to
himself and to his ways for with the best intention he may discover
that he has been guilty of an infraction not of a regulation found in
K R  O with which he has painfully made himself familiar and which
he has diligently exercised himself to observe but of one of those
seventeen hundred and sixtynine instructions and informations which
from time to time have appeared in those sacred writings known as Army
Divisional Brigade or Battalion Orders

In consequence an officer with a conscience toward his duty or an
ambition for promotion gives himself so completely to the business of
watching his step that only by a definite exercise of his altruistic
faculties can he indulge himself in the commendable civilian luxury of
caring for his neighbour

And so it came about that Major Bayne possessing in a large measure the
quality of canniness characteristic of his racea quality which for
the benefit of the uninitiated Saxon it may be necessary to define as
being a judicious blending of shrewdness and cautionand being
as well again after the manner of his race ambitious for his own
advancement and furthermore being a man of conscience had been so
entirely engrossed in the absorbing business of watching his step that
he had paid slight heed to the affairs of any other officer and least
of all to those of the chaplain whose functions in the battalion he had
regarded it must be confessed as more or less formal if not merely
decorative

But in spite of all this in the major the biggest thing was his heart
which however true to his race type again he kept stored in the
deepest recesses of his system To touch the majors heart was an
operation of more than ordinary difficulty It was that very thing
however which the letter to the battalion Commanding Officer from the
A D C S had achieved The effect of this letter upon the members of
the mess and most especially upon the junior major in regard to their
relation to their chaplain was revolutionary Hence the majors visit
to Barry upon the evening of his return

It was with an unusually cordial handshake that he greeted the chaplain

We are glad to have you back with us Captain Dunbar he said We
missed you and we have discovered that we need you Things have
been moving while you were away This battalion is undergoing a
transformation The O C is tightening down the screws of discipline
He sees and we all are beginning to see that we are up against a
different proposition from what we had imagined and right here Captain
Dunbar I want to say for myself and I believe for the rest of the
boys that we have not given you a square deal

His attitude and his words astounded Barry

Dont say that major he said in a voice husky with emotion Dont
say that I have been all wrong I am not going to talk about it but I
am awfully glad to get a second chance

If you need a second chance Pilot said the major for the first time
using the friendly western sobriquet believe me youll get it

The major sat down pulled out his pipe and began to impart some
interesting bits of news

Things are moving rather swiftly with us these days There are many
changes taking place Duff has gone permanently to the transport and is
in the way for a captaincy Hopeton has gone for a machine gun course
Sally is to be company commander in his place Booth takes charge of the
bombers Your friend Sergeant Knight is slated for a commission He
is doing awfully well with the signallers and by the way there is
something I want to show you tomorrow something quite unique and
remarkable our new instructor in bayonet fighting Do you know we were
rather stuck on our bayonet fighting but he has made the boys feel that
they didnt know anything about bayonet fighting or for that matter
about anything else I think you will enjoy him The boys are all up on
their toes There is nothing like the scream of a live shell coming in
to speed up the training

When the major had departed he left Barry in a maze of wonder and
gratitude That the battalion were glad to have him back that all the
old feeling of latent hostility of which he had been conscious was gone
and that they felt that they really needed him stirred in his heart a
profound sense of humility and gratitude

Late as it was he felt he must go out for a stroll about the camp just
to see the men and give them greeting

Wherever he went he was greeted with a new respect and a new cordiality
It was as if he had passed through some mystic initiation ceremony and
had been admitted into a magic circle of comradeship with the common
soldier than which no privilege is more dearly coveted by the officers
from the colonel himself to the youngest sub and which is indeed in
the last analysis the sine qua non of effective leadership

As Barry was passing the sergeants messroom the door opened and there
came out Sergeant Major McFetteridge himself with two others of the
mess

Good evening sergeant major said Barry quietly passing on his way

Good evening sir said the sergeant major with his usual stiff
salute Oh its you sir he cried as the light fell upon Barrys
face Were glad to see you back sir

Thank you sergeant major replied Barry offering his hand and Im
glad to be back with you all again

Thank you sir I assure you were glad to have you Wont you come
in sir The boys will all want to see you and so saying the sergeant
major threw wide open the door

Nowhere is class privilege more appreciated and more jealously guarded
than in the sergeants mess It is the most enclusive of all military
circles Realising this Barry was glad to accept the invitation The
hut was filled with sergeants in easy deshabille smoking lounging
playing various games

The chaplain boys announced the sergeant major and instantly every
man was on his feet and at attention

Its all right boys said the sergeant major The chaplain has just
dropped in for a minute for a friendly call and we want you to feel
sir he added for the sergeant major loved a little ceremonial that
we respectfully sympathise with you in your loss and that we consider
ourselves honoured by your presence here tonight

Barry was so deeply touched by the unexpected warmth of their welcome
and by the reference to his recent sorrow that he could not trust
himself to speak Without a word he passed around the group shaking
hands with each man in turn By the time he had finished the round he
had his voice in control and said

Sergeant major this is very kind of you I thank you for this welcome
and I am grateful for your sympathy He hesitated a moment or two
then as if he heard his fathers voice Tell them Tell them They
dont know Him he added And sergeant major if you will allow me
I have something I want to say to all the men when I get a chance I
cannot say it all tonight to the sergeants but this much I would like
to say That since I saw you I believe I have got a new idea of my work
in the battalion I got it from a sergeant major whose men told me that
he was a fine soldier and a brave man and more than that that he was
like a father to them That sergeant major was my own father From
him I learned that my job was not to jump on men for their faults but
to help men to know God who is our Father in Heaven and men I think
if I can do this I shall count myself happy for He is worth knowing
and we all need Him

His words gripped them hard Then he added Before I say good night
may I have the privilege of leading you to Him in words that you have
all learned at your mothers knee Then simply he spoke the words of
that immortal prayer the men joining in low and reverent voices

After the prayer he quietly said Good night and was passing out of
the hut He had not got to the door however when the sergeant majors
voice arrested him

Sir on behalf of the sergeants I thank you for coming in and I thank
you for your words You have done us all good

The following morning a sergeant from a neighbouring battalion
visiting the transport lines and observing Barry passing along with
Major Bayne on the battalion parade ground took occasion to remark

That is your padre aint it He checks you fellows up rather short
dont he

Yes that is our padre or Pilot as we like to call him was Sergeant
Mackays answer but I want to tell you that he can just check us up
until our heads touch the crupper and its nobodys damned business but
our own

Well you neednt get so blasted hot over it I aint said nothing
against your padre that I havent heard from your own fellows

Thats all right sergeant That was before we got to the war Im not
huntin for any trouble with anybody but if any one wants to start up
anything with any one sergeant in this battalion he knows how to do
it

And this came to be recognised as an article in the creed of the
sergeants mess

The bayonetfighting squad were engaged in some preliminary drill of
the more ordinary kind when Major Bayne and the chaplain arrived on the
ground

Well just watch the little beggar a while from here and go up later
said the major

As Barry watched the drill sergeant on his job it seemed to him that
he had never seen a soldier work before In figure in pose in action
there was a perfection about him that awakened at once admiration and
envy Below the average height yet not insignificant erect without
exaggeration precise in movement without angularity swift in action
without haste he was indeed a joy to behold

Now did you ever see anything like that enquired the major after
their eyes had followed the evolutions of the drill sergeant for a time

Never said Barry nor do I hope to again He is aI was going to
say dream but hes no dream Hes much too wide awake for that Hes a
poem thats what he is

Back and forth about and around stepped the little drill sergeant
a finished example of precise graceful movement He was explaining in
clean cut and evidently memorised speech the details of the movements
he wished executed but through his more formal and memorised vocabulary
his native cockney would occasionally erupt adding vastly to the
pungency and picturesqueness of his speech

He knows we are here all right said the major but he would not let
on if it were King George himself Ill bet you a months pay though
that we cant get one foot beyond what he considers the saluting point
before he comes to attention and as for his salute there is nothing
like it in the whole Canadian army Talk about a poem his salute has
Shakespeare faded Now hes going to move them off Watch and listen

Yeaouw came the longdrawn cry fiercely threatening representing
in English speech the word squad Then followed an expletive Yun
which for explosive quality made a rifle crack seem a drawl and which
appeared to release in the men a hidden spring drawn to its utmost
tension The slack and sagging line leaped into a rigid unit of
breathless motionless humanity

Aweouaw a prolonged vocalisation expressive of an infinite and
gentle pity and interpreted to the initiated ear to mean As you were
released the rigid line to its former sagging state

Naw then said the voice in a semiundertone slow and tense this
aint no arter dinner bloomin siester A little snappleease The
last word in a sharply rising inflection tightening up the spring
again for the explosive Yeaouwyun Squad attention
Aweouryun Aweouryun

Without warning came the commands repeating As you were Attention
He walked up and down before the rigid line looking them over and
remarking casually

Might be a little worse adding as an afterthought perhaps After
which with a sharp right turn and a quick march he himself
leading with a step of cleancut easy grace he moved them to the
bayonetfighting ground

By Jove breathed Barry Did you ever imagine anything like that

The result of ten years in the regular army said the major

Its almost worth it answered Barry

Arriving at the bayonetfighting ground the little sergeant major
put the squad through their manual as if they had been recruits to
a running comment of biting pleasantries After bringing them to
attention he walked slowly down the line then back again and remarked
after due deliberation

I have seen worsenot often Then in a tone of resignation he gave
the order

Stanayeh

The men stood at ease and then stood easy

Now then said the major well steal in on him if we can They
moved forward toward the little sergeant major who remained studying
the opposite horizon in calm abstraction until their toes had reached a
certain line when like the crack of a whip there came once more the
longdrawn cry with its explosive termination

YeaouwYun with the result that the line was again thrown into
instantaneous breathless and motionless rigidity

Toward the advancing officers the sergeant major threw himself into a
salute with one smooth unbroken movement of indescribable grace and
finish

Good morning sergeant major said Major Bayne Captain Dunbar this
is Sergeant Major Hackett

Again came the salute with a barely perceptible diminution of snap as
befitted a less formal occasion

Sergeant major said Barry I would give a great deal to be able to
do that

Wots that sir enquired the sergeant major

That salute of yours

Quite easy wen you knaow ow permitting himself a slight smile

You are doing some bayonetfighting I see sergeant major said Major
Bayne

Yes sir goin to do a bit sir replied the sergeant major

Very well carry on

And the sergeant major carried on putting into his work and into his
every movement and utterance an unbelievable amount of concentrated and
even vicious energy

On the bayonetfighting ground the first line of the enemy was
represented by sacks stuffed with straw hung upon a frame the
second by stuffed sacks deposited on the parapet of a trench In
bayonetfighting the three points demanding special emphasis are the
guarding of the enemys attack a swift bayonet thrust and an equally
swift recovery each operation whether in case of a living enemy or in
the stuffed effigy being attended with considerable difficulty Barry
was much interested in the psychological element introduced into the
exercises by the drill master

You must halways keep in mind that the henemy is before you Its
important that you should visualise your foe The henemy is hever before
you Anything beind a British soldier wont trouble anybody and you
are to remember that hits either you or im

In moments of rapid action the sergeant major evidently had difficulty
with his aspirates

The suspended sacks before you represent the henemy You are to treat
em so

Having got his line within striking distance of the swinging sacks
the exercise was directed by two commands On guard and Point the
first of which was supposed to knock off the enemys thrust and the
second to drive the bayonet home into his vitals after which without
command there must be a swift recovery

Naw then HngahPint

For some moments in response to these orders the squad practised
guarding and pointing not however to the complete satisfaction of
the sergeant

Naw then number five stick it hinto im Ye aint andin a lidy an
unbreller

Another attempt by number five being still suggestive of the amenities
proper to a social function the sergeant major stepped up to the
overgentle soldier

Naw then he said hobserve Theres my henemy See is hugly mug
Hngah Pint

At the words of command the sergeant major threw himself into his guard
and attacked with such appalling ferocity as must have paralysed an
ordinary foe sending his bayonet clean through to his guard and
recovering it with a clean swift movement

Having secured a fairly satisfactory thrust the sergeant major devoted
his attention to the recovery of the bayonet

Fetch it hout he cried fiercely Theres another man comin Fetch
it hout Ye may fetch is spinial column with it No matter e wont
need it

The final act in this gruesome drama was the attack upon the second line
represented by the sacks lying upon the parapet of the trench beyond
The completed action thus included the guard thrust recovery the
leap forward past the swinging line of sacks and a second thrust at
the figure prone upon the parapet with a second recovery of the weapon
this second recovery being effected by stamping the foot upon the
transfixed effigy and jerking back the bayonet with a violent upward
movement

This last recovery appeared to cause number five again some difficulty

Now then number five put a little aight hate into it Stamp your
bleedin obnyles hobnails on his fice and fetch it hout This wye
As he took the rifle from number five the sergeant majors face seemed
to be transformed into a living embodiment of envenomed hate his
attack thrust recovery gathering in intensity until with unimaginable
fury he leaped upon the prostrate figure drove his bayonet through to
the hilt stamped his hobnails upon the transfixed enemy jerked
his weapon out and stood quivering ready for any foe that dared to
approach The savage ferocity of his face the fierce energy in his
every movement culminating in that last vicious leap and stamp
altogether constituted such a dramatic and realistic representation of
actual fighting that the whole line burst into a very unsoldierly but
very hearty applause which however the sergeant major immediately and
sternly checked

What do you think of that enquired the major Isnt he a scream

He is perfectly magnificent said Barry and after all he is right
in his psychology There is no possibility of training men to fight
without putting the aight into it



CHAPTER XIV

A TOUCH OF WAR


The period of intensive training was drawing to a close The finishing
touches in the various departments that had come to be considered
necessary in modern warfare had been given With the putting on the
lacquer the fighting spirit of the men had been sharpened to its
keenest edge They were all waiting impatiently for the order to go
up The motives underlying that ardour of spirit varied with the
temperament disposition and education of the soldier There were those
who were eager to go up to prove themselves in that deadly struggle
where their fellow Canadians had already won their right to stand as
comrades in arms with the most famous fighting battalions of the British
army Others again there were in whose heart burned a deep passion to
get into grips with those hellish fiends whose cruelties practised upon
defenceless women and children in that very district where they were
camped and upon wounded Canadians had stirred Canada from Vancouver to
Halifax with a desire for revenge

But with the great majority there was little of the desire either for
military glory or for revenge Their country had laid upon them a duty
for the discharge of which they had been preparing themselves for many
months and that duty they were ready to perform More than that they
were eager to get at it and get done with it no matter at what cost
With all this too there was an underlying curiosity as to what the
thing would be like up there Far down below all their feelings
there lay an unanswered interrogation which no man dared to put to his
comrade and which indeed few men put to themselves That interrogation
was How shall I stand up under the test

The camp was overrun with rumours from returning battalions of the
appalling horrors of the front line Ever since that fateful 22nd of
April 1915 that day of tragedy and of glory for the Canadian army and
for the Canadian people the Ypres salient the point of honour on the
western front from Dixmude to Verdun had been given into the keeping of
the Canadian army During those long and terrible months in the face of
a continued bombardment and of successive counterattacks with the
line growing thinner week by week hacked up by woefully inadequate
artillery the Canadian army had held on with the grim tenacity of death
itself There was nothing that they could do but hold on To push the
salient deeper into the enemy lines would only emphasise the difficulty
and danger of their position The role assigned them was that of simply
holding steady with what ultimate objective in view no one seemed to
know

Week by week and month after month the Canadian battalions had
moved up into the salient had done their tours building up their
obliterated parapets digging out their chokedup watercourses
revetting their crumbling trenches and rebuilding their flimsy dugouts
and then returning to their reserve lines always leaving behind them in
hastily dug graves over the parados of their trenches or in the little
improvised cemeteries by Hooge or Maple Copse or Hill 60 a few more of
their comrades and ever sending down the line their maimed and broken
to be refitted for war or discharged again to civilian life It
was altogether a ghastly business a kind of warfare calling for an
endurance of the finest temper and a courage of the highest quality

From this grim and endless test of endurance the Canadians had
discovered a form of relief known as a trench raid a special
development of trench warfare which later came to be adopted by their
comrades of the French and British armies It was a form of sport grim
enough deadly enough greatly enjoyed by the Canadian soldiers and
the battalion which had successfully pulled off a trench raid always
returned to its lines in a state of high exaltation They had been able
to give Fritz a little of what they had been receiving during these
weary months

While the battalion waited with evergrowing impatience for the order
that would send them up the line a group of officers was gathered
in the senior majors hut for the purpose of studying in detail some
photographs secured by our aircraft of the enemy trenches immediately
opposite their own sector of the front line They had finished their
study and were engaged in the diverting and pleasant exercise of
ragging each other The particular subject of that discussion was their
various sprinting abilities and the comparative usefulness of various
kinds of funkholes as a protection against JJs Jack Johnsons
whizzbangs or the uncertain and wobbling minniewafers

Seldom had Barry found occasion to call upon Major Bustead with whom he
had been unable to establish anything more than purely formal relations
A message however from the orderly room to Lieutenant Cameron which
he undertook to deliver brought him to the senior majors hut

Come in padre said the major who of late had become more genial
and tell us the best kind of a funkhole for a minniewafer

The deepest and the closest for me major I should say said Barry
from what I have heard of those uncertain and wobbling beasts

I understand that chaplains do not accompany their battalions to the
front line but stay back at the casualty clearing stations suggested
the major Wise old birds they are too The major had an unpleasant
laugh

I suppose they go where they are ordered sir replied Barry but
if you will excuse me I have here a chit for Lieutenant Cameron sir
which has just come in and Barry handed Cameron his message

Will you allow me sir said Cameron

Certainly go on read it said the major

Cameron read the message and on his face there appeared a grave and
anxious look

Its from the casualty clearing station sir One of our chaps from
Edmonton is there dangerously wounded and wants to see me Id like to
go sir if I might

Oh certainly Ill make it all right with the O C Get a horse from
the transport Which casualty clearing station is it

Cameron looked at his message

Menin Mill sir

Menin Mill By gad I thought it was Brandthoek but Menin Mill good
Lord thats a different proposition Thats way beyond Ypres you know
Right up on the line You cant take a horse there Do you think you
ought to go up at all

I think I should like to go sir replied Cameron I know the chap
well Went to school and college with him

Then said the major you had better hurry up and attach yourself to
one of the transports going in You will barely be in time

Thank you sir said Cameron and left the room

Barry went out with him Who is it Cameron he said Do I know him

I dont know sir whether you do or not Its young McPherson of
Edmonton an awfully decent chap and my very best friend

May I go up with you Duncan I know Colonel Tait and Captain Gregg
who are at the Mill I understand

I would be awfully glad if you would but I hardly liked to ask you It
hasnt the reputation of being a very healthy place I hear

All right Cameron Im going up said Barry

Upon enquiry they found that they were too late for the transports and
again the question arose as to whether in view of the majors order
they should make the attempt by themselves

It was not really an order I think sir said Cameron It was more
in the way of a suggestion I think Ill go The note said dangerously
wounded and he sent for me

All right said Barry well go on and well almost certainly pick
up some one who will be able to direct us to the Mill

Their road which took them to Vlammertinghe led through level
fields lying waste and desolate with rank overgrowing weeds As they
approached that historic village they saw on every hand the cruel marks
of war On either side of the road were roofless and shattered cottages
grown around with nettles and briars Among these ruins as they found
on a later day were the old garden flowers pansies and daisies
bravely trying to hold their own Among the rank weeds was to be seen
the halfhidden debris of broken farm gear Here and there stood the
ruins of what had been a thrifty homestead with its stoneflagged
courtyard around which clustered its stables Now nettles and briars
grew around the broken walls and shattered staring windows At rare
intervals a great house appeared with pretentious gateway and
grassgrown drive winding up between stately and mutilated trees Over
the whole countryside hung a melancholy and weird desolation cottages
homesteads fields the very trees crying aloud to high heaven for pity
and vengeance

At Vlammertinghe itself the church tower still stood whole but
the church itself was wrecked as were most of the village shops and
dwellings In the village was to be seen no living thing except some
soldiers who in the broken cellars were making their bivouacs The
village stood deserted of its inhabitants ever since the terrific
onslaught of the Huns on the 22nd of April 1915 which had driven them
forth from their homes a panicstricken terrorhunted crowd of old
men women and little babes while over them broke with a continuous
and appalling roar a pitiless rain of shells

At the crossroads stood a mounted officer directing the traffic
which here tended to congestion As they entered the village the sentry
halted them to enquire as to their bona fides Having satisfied him
they enquired their way to the Menin Mill

Menin The rising inflection of the sentrys voice expressed a mild
surprise The old Mill Are you going there

Yes said Barry answering his inflection Why not

Well sir you know its rather a bad road Warm bit of country up
there but He shrugged his shoulders in quite a French manner as if
to say it was no business of his If you are going to Menin you keep
this road straight through past Wipers past the Cloth Hall out by the
Menin Gate A hot place that sir Then straight on taking the right
incline for about a mile and a half You will see a big cemetery on your
left The Mill stands near a big school on your right But why not drop
into the dressing station here sir right here in this old mill which
stands at the crossroads You may catch an ambulance going straight up
to the Mill

Thank you very much said Barry Well do that very thing

Good luck sir said the sentry saluting

They found an ambulance about to start and asked for a lift

All right sir said the driver but youd better step in and ask the
officer

They passed into a large and highvaulted stone building which in peace
days had been a mill The oldfashioned massive machinery was still
standing intact Obtaining permission from the officer they took their
places beside the driver of the ambulance and were soon on their way

It was already growing dark but although the surface of the stone pave
was frequently broken with shellholes the ambulance dodging round the
holes rushed without pause along at a high rate of speed

You dont use your lights asked Barry

No not lately sir said the driver Thats the newest order he
added in a tone of disgust

The road lay between double rows of once noble trees centuries old
with the first delicate green of spring softening their bare outlines
Now splintered twisted broken their wounds showing white in the
darkening light through the delicate green they stood silently eloquent
of the terrific force of the H E shell

As they went speeding along the shellmarked road they came upon a huge
trunk of a mighty elm broken clear from its stump lying partially
cross their track which soldiers were already busy clearing away
Without an instants pause the driver wheeled his car off the pave
crashed through the broken treetops and continued on his way

Barry looked upon the huge trunk with amazement

Did a single shell break that tree off like that he asked

You bet was the reply and all these you see along here Its
the great transport road for our front line and the boches shell it
regularly Here comes one now he added casually

There was a soft woolly whoof far away a high thin whine as from a
vicious insect overhead with every fractional second coming nearer and
yet nearer ever deepening in tone ever increasing in volume until
like an express train with an overwhelming sense of speed and power
and with an appalling roar it crashed upon them In the field on their
left there leaped fifty yards into the air a huge mass of earth and
smoke Then a stunning detonation

Insensibly Barry and Cameron both crouched down in the car but the
driver held his wheel without the apparent quiver of a muscle

Therell be three more presently I guess he said putting on full
speed

His guess proved right Again that distant woolly whoof the
longdrawn whine deepening to a scream the appalling roar and crash
and a second shell fell in the road behind them

Two said the driver coolly There will be a couple more

Again and yet again each time the terror growing deeper in their souls
came the two other shells but they fell far behind

Oh Fritzie remonstrated the driver thats rotten bad work Youll
have to do better than that

Again and again in groups of four the shells came roaring in but the
car had passed out of that particular zone of danger and sped safely on
its way

Do you have this sort of thing every night enquired Barry

Oh no cheerfully replied the driver Fritzie makes a lot better
practice than that at times Do you see this He put his finger upon
a triangular hole a few inches above his head I got that last week
We dont mind so much going up but its rather annoying when youre
bringing down your load of wounded

As they approached Ypres the road became more and more congested until
at length they had to thread their way between two continuous streams
of traffic up and down consisting of marching battalions transports
artillery wagons ambulances with now and then a motor or a big gun

About a mile from the city they came to a large red brick building
with pretentious towers and surrounded by a high brick wall

An asylum explained the driver Now used as a dressing station
Well just run in for orders

At what seemed to Barry reckless speed he whirled in between the brick
posts and turned into a courtyard on one side of which he parked his
ambulance

Better come inside sir said the driver They sometimes throw a few
in here seeing its a hospital

They passed down the wide stairs the centre of which had been converted
into a gangway for the passage of wheeled stretchers into a large
basement with concrete floors and massive pillars lit by flaring
gasjets Along the sides of the outer room were rows of wounded
soldiers their bandaged heads and arms no whiter than their faces a
patient and pathetic group waiting without complaint for an ambulance
to carry them down the line

In an inner and operating room Barry found two or three medical
officers with assistants and orderlies intent upon their work While
waiting there for their driver they heard overhead again that ominous
and terrifying whine this time however not long drawn but coming in
with terrific speed and ending with a sharp and shattering crash
Again and again and again with hardly a second between there came the
shells It seemed to Barry as if every crash was fair upon the roof
of the building but no man either of the medical attendants or of the
waiting wounded paid the slightest heed

At length there came a crash that seemed to break within the very room
in which they were gathered The lights flickered some of them went
out there was a sound as if a tower had crashed down upon the roof
Dust and smoke filled the room

Light up that gas said the Officer Commanding An orderly sprang to
obey The gasjets were once more lighted and the work went on

Rather near wasnt that one asked Barry of a wounded man at his
side

Yes he replied casually they got a piece that time and again he
sunk into apathetic silence

In a few moments the driver had obtained his orders and was ready to set
forth

Better wait a bit said the sergeant at the door until their Evening
Hate is over

Oh thats all right said the driver I guess Fritz is pretty well
through They are rather crowded there at the mill and I guess well go
on

In his heart Barry earnestly hoped that the sergeant would interpose
with a more definite command but inasmuch as the bombardment had
apparently ceased and as if it were all in a days work the driver
buttoning up his coat said

Well go sir if you are ready

A few minutes run brought them to the gate of the ruined city As
the car felt its way through the ghostly town Barry was only vaguely
conscious in the darkness of its ghostly skeletonlike ruins Fifteen
minutes brought them to the Menin gate

Sounds rather hot out there remarked the driver Well Fritzie
I guess we wont join your party this time We prefer to wait if you
dont mind really

He ran the car into the lee of the ramparts by the side of the gateway
waited there half an hour or so until the Evening Hate was past then
onward again to the Menin Mill

They lifted the blanket covering the sandbagged entrance passed through
a dark corridor and came into a cellar lit by lanterns swinging from
the roof and by candles everywhere upon ledges or upon improvised
candlesticks

No sooner had they come into the light than Barry saw across the room
his friend Dr Gregg his coat off and his shirtsleeves rolled to his
elbows

Hello Dunbar said the doctor coming forward I guess I wont shake
hands just now Sit down Wont you have a cup of coffee Jim turning
to an orderly give Captain Dunbar a cup of coffee

Barry presented Cameron to his friend and together they sat down and
waited When the doctor was through with his patient he came and sat
down with them

We came up to see a young chap named McPherson I think you sent a note
down about him today

McPherson said the doctor I dont remember but I will see

He turned to a desk and turning over the pages of a record apparently
found the name and returned to Barry

I am sorry to say that McPherson died this afternoon he said

Dead said Barry He turned to Cameron Im awfully sorry Duncan

Was there anybody with him he enquired of the doctor He was
Lieutenant Camerons very close friend and college companion

Oh awfully sorry replied the doctor Yes I think Captain Winter
the chaplain of the th was with him at the last Hes not here just
now I can tell you where to get him Tomorrow is his day here

Isisis his body still here enquired Cameron after a few moments
silence

Yes its in the next room Do you want to see it He was pretty badly
smashed up Im afraid

I think I should like to see him said Cameron I know his people
you see and I would like to tell them that I saw him

Oh all right said the doctor He called an orderly

Come this way sir said the orderly

Together they followed the orderly into the next room apparently a
storehouse for grain There lying upon the floor they saw three silent
shapes wrapped in grey blankets

This is Mcpherson sir said the orderly looking at the card attached
to the blanket

He stooped drew down the blanket from the face and stepped back In
civil life both Barry and Cameron had seen the faces of the dead but
only in the coffin after having been prepared for burial by those whose
office it is to soften by their art deaths grim austerities

Cameron gave one swift glance at the shapeless bloody mass out of
which stared up at him wideopen glassy eyes

Oh my God my God he gasped gripping Barry by the arm and
staggering back as if he had received a blow He turned to the door as
if to make his escape but Barry himself white and shaken held him
firmly

Steady old boy he said Steady Duncan

Oh let me go Let me get out of here

Duncan there are a lot of wounded chaps out there

The boyhe was only nineteenwas halted at the word stood motionless
and then muttered

You are right sir I was forgetting

And Duncan remember said Barry in a quiet and solemn voice
theres more than that to McPherson That fine young chap whom you knew
and loved is not that poor and battered piece of clay Your friend has
escaped from death and all its horrors

Yes yes I know whispered Cameron still shaking Well go out now
sir Ill be all right I assure you Im all right

They passed out into the dressingroom again where the wounded were
continuing to arrive Cameron was for departing at once but Barry
held him back unwilling that the lad should be driven away beaten and
unnerved by what he had seen

I say Duncan lets see some of these boys We can perhaps cheer them
up a bit They need it badly enough God knows

All right muttered Cameron sitting down upon a bench in the shadow
They waited there till Dr Gregg came along

Hello Dunbar you are looking seedy Feeling rotten eh said the
doctor eying him critically for a few moments

Oh Im all right said Barry The truth is Ive just been in there
with young Cameron Rather a ghastly sight Camerons badly knocked up
Can you do anything for him

Sure thing said the doctor cheerfully Stay right there where you
are Ill bring you something in a moment or two Now sit right there
do you hear Dont move

In a few moments he returned bringing hot coffee for them both

There he said in a cheerful matteroffact voice drink that

Barry gulped it down Cameron taking his more slowly and with evident
distaste The doctor continued to converse with them in tones of
cheerful and as Barry thought of almost careless indifference

Now I must leave you said the doctor I see theres a case of shell
shock We didnt know how to handle that for a while The British R A
M C for some months declined to recognise it as requiring treatment at
all You might care to look at this chap Poor devil

Barry had been looking at the man ever since he had come into the room
supported by two of his comrades He was indeed an object of pity
Of splendid physique six feet and powerfully built with the fine
intelligent face of an educated man he stood there white twitching in
every muscle in a state of complete nervecollapse

Colonel Tait who had been observing him keenly ever since his entering
the room now approached him greeted him with a cheerful Hello took
him by the hand and felt his pulse

How are you old chap Feeling a little better than you were arent
you

Yesdoctor RatherrottenthoughBe all righttomorrow

Sure you will Still a little rest wont do you any harm Well send
you down for a couple of weeks and then you will be fit enough to have
another go at the boche

So saying he turned him over to an assistant and went on with his work
At this point Cameron from whose eyes the look of horror had not yet
faded leaned over to Barry and whispered

Lets get out of this For Heavens sake this thing is getting me He
glanced at Barry What are you ill too

Ill answered Barry between his clenched teeth Ill No why should
I be ill Look at these boys I see myself ill By Jove he added under
his breath heres another shell shock Sit down Cameron His voice
took on a sterner tone Sit down Dont be an ass

Once more Colonel Tait took in hand the shellshock man This second was
a stretcher case The man was very violent requiring two men to hold
him on his stretcher

Oh let him go Let him go said Colonel Tait Whats wrong with
you he said to the man Have you any wounds

No sir chattered the man miserably Shellshocksir
Buriedtwiceby a shell Oh Ah

The colonel had a few moments conversation with Gregg who came over to
where Barry was sitting and said

I say Dunbar watch this case You will see some fun

Fun echoed Barry shaken and indignant Not much fun for that poor
chap

Stand up said the colonel sharply

The man stood up without much apparent difficulty

Ah said the colonel Shell shock Bad case too His voice was kind
and sympathetic He gripped the man by the arm and ran his hand down his
spine until he came to the small of his back

Pain there eh he said giving the man a poke

Yes yes Ouw Doctor Awful

Thought so said the doctor Bad case Poor chap A curious feeling
in the legs eh

The man nodded vigorously still twitching violently and making animal
moanings

Still pursuing his investigations and continuing to sympathise with his
patient the doctor enquired as to other symptoms to all of which the
patient promptly confessed When the examination was completed the
doctor gave his man a hearty slap on the back and said

Youre all right my boy Go treat yourself to a cup of cocoa and a
good thick slice of bread and raspberry jamraspberry rememberand
tomorrow you can report to your battalion medical officer

What exclaimed the man Doctor I cant go up again Im not fit to
go up

Oh yes you can my boy Youll be in good fighting trim tomorrow
Youll see Youll see Come back here some day perhaps with a V C

Thereupon the man began to swear violently

Here none of that said the doctor sharply or up you go tonight

A grin ran around the dressing station in which none joined more
heartily than the first shellshock man waiting to be conveyed down the
line

They dont get by the old man often nowadays was Dr Greggs
comment

You dont often get cases like this though do you enquired Barry

Not often We have passed through this dressing station some thousands
of cases and we may have had eight or ten malingerers But this is not
all sham There is a strong mixture of hysteria and suggestion with the
sham A chap with a highly organised temperament gets buried by a shell
That is a terrific nerve shock He sees two or three chaps blown to
bits Another nerve shock Now he has heard about shell shock as a
result of a similar experience Immediately the suggestion begins to
work and the man discovers in himself the well known symptoms of genuine
shell shock and begad I dont wonder What we have just given him is
part of the treatment for hysteriaa little nerve tonic A good sleep
may put him all right by tomorrow morning The chances are however
that the O C will send him down for a few days rest and change If
so the chap will be as happy as a clam The boys will rag him half to
death down there so that he will be keen to get back again and the
chances are may get his V C Oh we all get scared stiff laughed
Gregg We are none of us proud about here That hero stuff that you
read about in the home papers we dont know much about We just carry
on

By Jove Gregg Thats all right but to just carry on in this
business it seems to me calls for some pretty fine hero stuff

Well we dont call it so said Gregg Now Ill see about your
ambulance I believe theres one about ready to go I think I can find a
place for you and your friend and it will save you a long walk

They came away from the old mill with mingled feelings Barry had to a
certain extent recovered from his shock and had himself somewhat firmly
in hand Cameron was still silent and obviously shaken

It was grey dawn when they arrived at the camp physically weary
nervously exhausted and sick at heart Barry wakened Hobbs who greeted
them with the news that the battalion was under orders to go up that
night By his own state Barry was able to gauge that of his friend
Cameron The experiences of the last ten hours had been like nothing in
his previous life The desolation wrought by war upon the face of the
country upon the bodies of men upon their souls had sickened and
unnerved him and this he remembered was an experience of only a brief
ten hours He was conscious of a profound selfdistrust and humiliation
as he thought of those other men those medical officers with their
orderlies the ambulance drivers those wounded soldiers How could they
endure this horror day in and day out for weeks and for months In a
few hours he would have to meet his fellow officers and the men They
could not fail to read in his face all this that he carried in his
heart

By his grey haggard face he knew that the same horror and fear had gone
deep into his friends soul There came to him the sudden thought that
Cameron too must meet his fellow officers and must endure their
searching chaff and that he would reveal himself to his undoing for
no man can ever live down in his battalion the whisper that he is
a quitter That very night Cameron would be forced to lead up his
platoon into the front line and must lead them step by step over that
same Vlammertinghe road where the transports were nightly shelled In
the presence of any danger soever he must not falter When the shells
would begin to fall he knew well how the eyes of his men would turn to
their leader and search his very soul to see of what quality he was
Far better a man should die than falter He had not failed to notice the
startled look in Camerons eyes when Hobbs blurted out his news Some
way must be found for the bracing up of the nerve the steadying of the
courage of his friend

Come in with me Cameron he said standing at the door of his hut
Im dead beat and so are you Well have coffee and some grub and then
sleep for a couple of hours until reveille

Cameron hesitated The thing he most longed for at that moment was to be
alone

Come on insisted Barry Hobbs will have a fire going and hot coffee
in ten minutes Come on old chap I want you to

He threw his arm around Camerons shoulder and dragged him in The boy
dropped onto Barrys cot and as he was boots and coat on was asleep
before the coffee was ready His boyish face with its haggard look
struck pity to Barrys heart and recalled his fathers words These
boys need their mothers If ever a lad needed his mother it was young
Cameron and just in that hour

He woke the boy up gave him his coffee had Hobbs remove his boots
made him undress and covered him up in his blankets Then taking his
own coffee he lay down on Hobbs bed

Harry he said give us every minute of sleep you can Wake us just
onehalf hour before reveille with coffee and everything else good you
can rustle and Harry waken me before Mr Cameron

When he lay down to sleep he made an amazing discoverythat his own
horror and fear and selfdistrust had entirely passed away He felt
himself quite prepared to carry on How had this thing come to pass
His physical recuperation by means of coffee and food This doubtless in
part but only in part In his concern for his friend he had forgotten
himself and in forgetting himself he had forgotten his fear It was an
amazing discovery

Thank the good God he said He never forgets a fellow and I wont
forget that

He woke to find Hobbs at his side with coffee toast and bacon and on
the floor beside his cot his tub awaiting himthe tub being a rubber
receptacle exactly eighteen inches in diameter

He hurried through his dressing and his breakfast all the while
Cameron lying like a dead man and with almost a dead mans face

Barry hated to waken him but reveille was but a bare thirty minutes
off and he had an experiment to work upon his friend

Bring the coffee Harry Not the bacon yet he ordered

Hello Cameron old boy Wake up

Cameron rolled over with a groan and opened his eyes still dull and
heavy with sleep

Here you are Pipe this down your tunnel and look lively too You have
got thirty minutestwentyfive reallyto reveille and you have your
toilet to performshave massage manicure and all the restso go to
it Heres your tub You cant get into it but soap yourself over and
Hobbs will sluice you with a pail or two outside

Why all this Spartan stuff Its awfully cold I think Ill content
myself with a nose rub this morning

Get out of bed and be quick about it commanded Barry unless youd
rather take your tub where you are

So saying he jerked the clothes clear off the cot threatening Cameron
with the tub Cameron sprang up stripped soaped himself over groaning
and shivering the while then stood outside in the open while Hobbs
administered the order of the bath and after a vigorous rub came in
glowing

By jingo Thats bully Its a pity a fellow cant always feel just how
bully it is before he takes it

Naaw then a little snap ordered Barry in attempted imitation of
the inimitable Sergeant Major Hackett A little speed pleease Thats
better Ive seen worsenot often

And so he rattled on through Camerons dressing and shaving operations

Now then Obbs a little Delmonico ere Shove this bacon against your
fice Cameron

What about yours sir said Cameron as he sat down to the luxuries
which somehow Hobbs had rustled

Had it you slacker Then with a swift change of voice and manner he
added Listen to me Cameron Im going to have my prayers You wont
bother me any and if you dont mind Ill do them out loud Dont you
stop eating though Hobbs stop your wandering around there and sit
down and listen Barry took his Bible

Cameron he said one comfort in reading the Bible to a chap with a
father like yours is that you know all about the thing alreadycontext
historical references and theological teachingtherefore no need of
comment Also you have a good imagination to see things Turn on the
juice while I read Hobbs you waken up too

Then he began to read the vivid words which picture as in miniature
etchings the life stories of the heroes of Faith who in their day held
their generation steady and pointed the way to duty and victory As he
read his face became alight his dark eyes glowed his voice thrilled
under the noble passion of the words he read Then he came to this
stately peroration

And what shall I more say For the time would fail me to tell of
Gideon and so on through the list of heroes Who through faith
subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the
mouths of lions of whom the world was not worthy Wherefore seeing we
also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let
us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus
the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set
before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at
the right hand of the throne of God

Both reader and hearers were swept along upon the tide of dramatic
passion They were themselves a part of the great and eternal conflict
there pictured they too were called upon to endure the cross

Cameron had forgotten his breakfast and with his kindling eyes
fastened upon the readers face was listening to the noble music of the
thrilling words

Barry closed his book and laid it down

Great eh Wonderful company All the finest and the best of the wars
heroes are in it Now then prayer He dropped on his knees Cameron
and Hobbs following his example

It was a prayer chiefly of thanksgiving for those who in their day
and in the face of anguish and terror and death had kept the faith of
thanksgiving too for all who in this present day of sacrifice in the
home land and of sacrifice upon the field of battle were keeping that
same faith for the Empire and for this same sacred cause of humanity
The prayer closed with a simple petition that they in the battalion
might be found worthy of a humble place in that great company

As they were repeating together the prayer Our Father the notes of
the reveille sounded shrilly over the camp

Go out Hobbs for a minute said Barry after they had risen from
their prayer He knew well that Cameron would want a few minutes with
him alone

Sir said the boy and his voice was quiet and steady Im not going
to try to thank you but I believe I can carry on now

You bet you can said Barry gripping his hand You bet you can Its
the point of view after all old man isnt it For ourselves it doesnt
matter but we have got to think of the boys and we have got to stay
with the game

Eighteen hours later the relief was completed and the battalion was
in its place in the line all but the sentries asleep in their flimsy
dugouts and behind their rotten parapets

An hour later Barry who was sleeping with the M O in the regimental
aid post was wakened from a dead sleep by the M O

Theres something doing out there he said Listen

There was a quick succession of sharp explosions

Bombs said the M O

The explosions were followed by the rattattattattattattattat of
the machine guns Instantly they were both on their feet and out in the
trench

I guess Fritzie is trying to put something over on us being our first
night said the M O Ill get my boys out

He ran to the adjoining dugout where his corporal and stretcher bearers
were sleeping roused them and sent them up the trench There was
the sound of subdued voices and of quick marching feet along the
communication trench a few yards away They stood together listening for
a few minutes

Im going said Barry hurrying off in the direction of the sound
Come on

Captain Dunbar called the M O sharply my place is here and I
think this is where you will be most useful as well They will bring the
wounded to us right here

In a few minutes all was still again except for the machine guns which
still kept up their incessant tattoo

The M O was correct in his forecast In a few minutes down the
communication trench came a wounded man walking jubilant in spite of
his wounds

Fritzie tried to put one over on us he exclaimed while the doctor
was dabbing with iodine and tying up his wounded arm but I think hes
got another guess coming You ought to have seen our officer he added
The first one in the bunch to be at em With a bayonet too mind
you Grabbed one from a private as he ran past and bombs bursting like
hell all around Beg pardon sir he added turning to Barry Hes
some kid poor chap Hes got his I guess

Who is he asked the M O

Lieutenant Cameron sir

Cameron cried Barry Where is he

They are carrying the stretcher cases right down to the dressing
station I hear said the man

Im going doc said Barry and was off at a run

At the casualty clearing station there was no excitement the doctors
and orderlies carrying on as usual receiving the wounded dressing
their wounds sending them down with the smoothness and despatch
characteristic of their department

Cameron said the doctor in answer to Barrys question Why
certainly Ill show you And he led him to Camerons cot

Well old chap said the doctor cheerily were going to send you
down in a minute or two Now dont talk

Camerons eyes welcomed Barry

Dear old boy said Barry dropping on his knees beside him Im
awfully sorry

Its all right whispered Cameron TheyneverknewYoull write
dadand tell himI kept The voice trailed off into silence The
morphia was doing its merciful work

Kept the faith said Barry

Yes whispered Cameron with a smile faint but exultant

Good old boy whispered Barry

Yes IkeptI kept

The bearers came to carry out the stretcher

Will he recover whispered Barry to the doctor

Recover Surest thing you know said the doctor in a loud cheery
voice We cant spare this kind of stuff you know

And again Barry leaned over the stretcher and said patting Cameron on
the shoulder

Good old boy You make us proud of you You kept the faith



CHAPTER XV

THINNING RANKS


Three months in that hellhole of the salient have made their mark on
this battalion said Transport Sergeant Mackay

Yes theres quite a lot of these round the first line and back about
here replied the pioneer sergeant who was putting the finishing
touches upon some crosses that were to be sent up the line that night

Thats so Fatty Whose is that cross you are finishing

Thats Lieutenant Salfords a fine young officer he was too Always
had a smile The deeper the mud the more Sally smiled And this here
is Lieutenant Booths Theres a chap now that picked up wonderful Two
months ago everybody thought he was a big soft slob and those bombers
say that he was all right And heres the M Os Poor old doc There
was a man now if there ever was one He wasnt afraid of nothing He
would go walking about with a smile when a bombardment was on and in
that last big show the other day they say him and the chaplaintheres
another peachthey carried on wonderful I wasnt around there at the
time but the boys at the dressing station told me that them two worked
back and forward getting out the wounded I think they had about thirty
injured up at that time as if it was a kind of er summer shower that
was falling let alone H Es and whizzbangs and then after they got
the last man out the M O went in with some stretcher bearers just
lookin around before he left and a shell came and got em all and
they say it was about the last shell that was throwed And thats where
poor Harry Hobbs got his too The Pilot went out just a minute before
and when he came back thats what he saw They say he was terrible cut
up over the M O Funny thing the M Os face was just as quiet as if
he had gone to sleep but the rest of the boys well you could hardly
get em together and the Pilot walkin up and down there lookin like a
lost man We buried em right there by Maple Copse I want to tell
you sergeant that thats the hardest job I ever done in this war The
Pilot he broke right down in the middle of the service It must have
been hard for him Ive been with him now at every funeral and he stands
up to his work like a man He takes it kind of cheery almost but when
we was puttin down the M O and poor Harry the Pilot just couldnt
appear to stand it I cried like a baby and you ought to have seen the
crowd the O C and the adjutant and the pioneers and they are all
pretty hardened up by this time They have done enough plantin anyhow
They just all went to pieces The shells was goin overhead among the
trees something awful but nobody minded more than if they had been
peashooters First time I ever seen the Pilot break and I have been
with him ever since the first one we buried and that was big Jim Berry
A sniper got him You dont remember I guess you dont see much or get
much of the news back here

Back here exclaimed Sergeant Mackay What do you mean back here
Dont I have to go up every night with the transport and through that
barridge too This aint no safety first job

I know sergeant Im not sayin you aint at war Believe me Id
rather be up front than to go up round Hell Fire Corner and come back
by the Menin Gate every night like you fellows I aint sayin nothing
about that but you dont see things that I see and you dont get the
news same as I do Now about Jim Berry you know he was goin to do
some snipin in place of McCuaig who went to the machine gun company

McCuaig in the machine gun company I never heard that

Well thats what Im sayin said Sergeant Matthews you dont get
some of the chances to get news down here same as me You see when
were sewin up the boys and fixin em up like and when were fixin
up the graves and puttin on the crosses you get kind of thinkin about
things and kind of lonesome and so the boys keep telling the news
to cheer themselves up and thats how I heard about McCuaig You see
McCuaig was snipin the first tour and hes a killer you bet and he
had only cut three natches in his rifle The boys say he had got four
of the Huns but he had only put down three natches on his rifle to be
sure and after he seen the machine gun work stoppin a raid he comes
to the officer and says he givin him his rifle Say this is all
right for sport but it aint good enough for killin these devils Id
like to get on to your gang if I can and they put him right onto the
machine gun Say hes sleepin with that Lewis gun ever since Just
pets it like a baby What was I tellin you Oh yes about McCuaig and
Jim Berry Well he took McCuaigs place snipin and a good sniper he
was too He used to hunt you know up in the mountains with Jim Knight
every fall Well he started out snipin the day after McCuaig quit and
McCuaig gave him his rifle too and took him up to the hide Well big
Jim was always a careless cuss you know He gets his eye on the hole
sightin his rifle and McCuaig was watchin through one of them new
things

Perrys scope

Yes thats it Paris cope Them French is mighty smart fellows
you bet When along walks a Hun There he comes sings out McCuaig
Didnt see him until he got past says Jim pretty mad because Jim
hated to show that hed got buck fever or something and waited for
the next Here he comes says McCuaig again Bang goes Jim Ive
got him he shouts hoppin up to get a good look when McCuaig grabs
him and jerks him down swearin somethin awful and tellin him he
wasnt shootin no mountain goats Oh shaw says Jim They cant get
me You keep your head down Jim said McCuaig Thats the very last
words he said to him just as he was leavin him He wasnt down the
next day when bang goes Jims rifle and again up he jumps to see what
hed got when ping goes a Boche bullet right through his head You
know McCuaig was real mad and he stood quiet at that hole for three
hours Then he got Corporal Thom to shove up a hat on a rifle when
ping comes the bullet and bang goes Jims rifle Guess he wont shoot
no more unless theres shootin in hell says he and makes another
natch Say the boys all felt bad about Jim and so did the Pilot Well
we had to plant him that night as we was goin out next day It was out
beyond the Loop You dont know where that is I guess

Of course I do asserted Mackay indignantly Ive been all around
that front line What are you givin us

Oh you have eh Well I wouldnt unless I had to you bet Its no
place for a man with a waist line like mine Well as I was sayin that
cemetery was right out in the open right under observation and exposed
to machine guns snipers whizbangs all the hull bloody lot of em
Wasnt no place for a cemetery anyway I say Im not after any bomb
proof job but a cemetery should be

Should be a quiet and retired spot suggested one of the transport
boys

Yes Whats the use of getting livin men shot up when theyre buryin
dead men I want to know Not saying anything about the officers thats
always round and the chaplain I say a cemetery should be somewhere out
of sight like Maple Copse now theres a good place except that the
roots make it hard diggin Up against a railway bank like that down at
Zillebeck by the Railway Dugouts theres a lovely place

How would the Ramparts do sergeant enquired another transport lad

Ramparts You mean at Ypres Yes said the sergeant with a grin but
Id hate to turn out the Brigade Headquarters Staff

Go on sergeant

Well as I was sayin thats no place for a cemetery up there beyond
the Loop but I didnt know so much about it then you bet Thats where
we had to bury Jim It was a awful black night and of course just as
we got out to the trench to go overland to the cemetery them flares
started up something awful I dont know what they was lookin for but
when they went up I want to tell you I felt about the size of a tree
and I wisht I was one Well Jim you know was pretty heavy an awful
heavy carry he was for the boys I was tryin to hurry em along but
that Pilot he heads the procession and on he goes at a funeral march
pace Now I believe in doin things right Ive heard of some pioneers
that hurries their job I dont believe in that but when you are
going across the open on a dark night with them flares going up I
say between flares is a good time to get a move on but no that there
Pilot he just goes that pace and no more I want to tell you the boys
was nervous and the officers too The O C and Major Bustead was there
I could see the major fussin to get on Well we got Jim down all
right and just as the Pilot got started darned if they didnt open up
the biggest kind of a machine gun chorus you ever heard

What did you do sergeant

Me Well I started huggin mud and saying all the good words I could
think of Even the O C got down on his knees and the major he near
got into the grave but that darned Pilot stood up there getting taller
every minute and goin on with his prayer and the boys sayin Amen
that loud and emphatic that I thought hed take the hint and cut out
somethin but cut out nothin Seemed as if his memory was workin
over time the way he kept a fetchin up things that he could a easily
forgot and when he comes to the benediction the whizbangs begin to
come Up goes his hand the way they do I thought to myself that that
was a kind of unnecessary display I looks up and there he was more
like a tree than ever In fact I says to myselfits queer how you
think things at times like thatdarned if they wont think the darned
fool is a tree for nothin but a darned tree would stand up in the
flare light and look so much like a tree anyhow I guess thats what
saved him He never moved until he was done and then didnt he stay
with us pioneers after the rest had gone until we filled up Say hes
all right

You bet hes all right said Sergeant Mackay and hes gettin in his
work with the boys

What do you mean gettin in his work enquired the pioneer
sergeant

Oh well you know said Sergeant Mackay awkwardly hes makin em
think a lot different about things I know he has em tied up all right
in their language And this was as near to a confession of faith as the
sergeant cared to go

Oh I can see a difference myself up the line said the pioneer
sergeant The boys used to get out of his way He used to jump on em
something fierce You remember

Huhuh

Well they just love to have him drop in now and they tell him things
I saw Corporal Thom the other night showin him his girls picture and
the Pilot thought she was a fine girl too and got her address down
and said he was going to write her and tell her what a fine chap the
corporal was and you ought to see Corporal Thom swell up until he most
bust his tunic

Oh I know the corporals dippy about the Pilot said Sergeant Mackay

Yes and the officers too said the pioneer sergeant Theres
Captain Duff Well you know what a holy terror he is

Hes all right said Sergeant Mackay stoutly He was my chief for
about a month here and he was the first one to get this transport
licked into shape you bet

Im not saying anything against Captain Duff but he was a roughneck
you know well enough and I guess he hadnt much use for the Pilot

Oh I know all about that said Sergeant Mackay The Pilot used to go
up with us on the transport It was awful hard on Captain Duff handlin
the column and the mules and all the rest to hold in when the Pilot was
along The captain he had to come round now and then to the rear There
he would have a lovely time for a few minutes with the Pilot safe up in
front But the Pilot calmed him down all right

Yes and theres that young Captain Fraser said the pioneer sergeant
with a note of enthusiasm in his monotonous voice There a soldier He
just loved fightin I remember the night he got his wound It was on
a raid of course If there was a raid on Captain Neil was sure to be
there He just about got his arm blown off but they say hes goin to
be all right I was at the regimental aid post when they fetched him in
Oh he was a dirty mess face all cut up and his arm hangin and not a
word out of him until the Pilot comes along Then he begins to chirp up
and the Pilot starts jollyin him along one minute and sayin Psalms to
him the next minute and little prayers and the boys around listenin
sometimes grinnin and sometimes all choked up but Im awful glad
Captain Neil is comin round all right

By this time the pioneer sergeant had his crosses finished

Well he said as he set the crosses against the wall theres three
of the finest officers we ever had in this battalion You take em up
tonight when you go sergeant

Were not going up tonight The boys are coming out this evening
replied Sergeant Mackay

No Is that so I never heard that Guess Ill have to go up with
some other outfit Comin out this evening Well its time they were
Theyve had one hell all the time I hear this tour

Yes continued Sergeant Mackay and the highlanders are sending up
their band to meet them and play them out I call that a mighty fine
thing to do You know our own band had to go up with water and rations
last night and they cant get out until tonight So the Highlanders
band

Pretty good band too isnt it

Best pipe band in the army said Sergeant Mackay with enthusiasm

Oh a pipe band exclaimed the pioneer sergeant in a disappointed
tone

Yes a pipe band what else enquired Sergeant Mackay truculently

Why dont they send up their real band when theyre doin it anyway

What shouted Sergeant Mackay Ill tell you For the same reason
that they dont make you O C in this battalion you damned fat
lobster There now youve started me swearin again and I was quittin
it

Sergeant Mackays wrath at the slur cast upon the pipe band the
only band in his opinion worthy of any real mans attention was
intensified by his lapse into his habit of profanity which out of
deference to the Pilot he for some weeks had been earnestly striving to
hold in check

Oh well Scotty dont spoil your record for me I guess a pipe band is
all right for them that likes that kind of music For me I cant ever
tell when they quit tunin up and begin to play

Sergeant Mackay looked at him with darkening face evidently uncertain
as to what course he should adoptwhether to turn himself loose upon
this benighted Englishman or to abandon him to his deserved condition
of fatuous ignorance He decided upon the latter course In portentous
silence he turned his back upon Fatty Matthews and walked the whole
length of the line to get a mule back over the rope It took him some
little time for the mule had his own mind about the manoeuvre and
the sergeant was unwontedly deliberate and gentle with him Then the
manoeuver executed he walked slowly back to the pioneer sergeant and in
restrained and carefully chosen speech addressed him

Look here Fatty Im askin you dont you ever say things like that
outside of these lines for the sake of the regiment you know Id
really hate the other battalions to know we had got such He halted
himself abruptly and then proceeded more quietly A man as you in this
battalion My God Fatty theyd think your brains had run down into
your pants I know they havent because I know you havent any He
took a fresh breath and continued his address in a tone of patient
remonstrance Why man dont you know that wherever the British Army
has gone its Highland regiments have cleared the way and that when the
pipes get playin the devil himself couldnt hold them back

I dont wonder said Fatty innocently They make a man feel like
fightin all right

Sergeant Mackay scanned his face narrowly uncertain as to whether
he should credit the pioneer sergeant with intelligence sufficient to
produce a sarcasm

What I mean is exclaimed Fatty seeking to appease the wrathful
transport sergeant when you hear them pipes you get so stirred up
you know that you just feel like kullin somebody

This apparently did not improve matters with Sergeant Mackay

Oh darn it you know what I mean

No Fatty said the sergeant solemnly I dont know what you mean
but Ill suggest this to you Fatty You go down to that Pete mule down
there at the end of the line and talk to him I guess hell understand
you Im busy just now

I dont see what youre so hot about said the pioneer sergeant in an
aggravated voice but Im going to see the boys come in anyway

When the distant sound of the pipes coming from the direction of the
front line was heard in camp men of the various transport lines and
base units lined up to watch the battalion come in For the rumour had
run that they had had a bad go that they had beaten back no less than
three rather formidable raids of the enemy and had been badly cut up
More than that by reason of the lack of reinforcements they had had
to do a double tour so that they were returning from an experience of
thirteen days in what was indeed the veritable mouth of hell

I guess they are all pretty well all in said Sergeant Matthews who
standing with his pioneers had been carefully avoided by his friend
Sergeant Mackay That enthusiastic Scot had for the time being abandoned
his transport and was fraternising with the transport men of the
Highlanders with whom he was sure he would feel himself in more
complete accord

Here they come boys said a Scot as the sound of the pipes grew
louder Theres a drummer for ye Listen til that double roll wull
ye

Ay Danny the boys will be shovin out their chests and hitchin their
hips about something awful

Ye may say that Hec Will ye look at young Angus on the big drum man
but he has got the grrand style on him

Ay boys they are the laads said Sergeant Mackay yielding to the
influence of his environment and casually dropping into the cadence of
the Highlanders about him which during his ten years in the west
his tongue had wellnigh lost Its a very fine thing your pipers are
doing playing our boys out in this way and we wont be forgetting that
in a hurry

Why for no enquired Hec in surprise Its the Highlanders
themselves that love a bonny fighter

Down the road between lines of silent men came the pipers with waving
kilts and flying tartans swinging along in their long swaying stride
young Angus doing wonders on the big drum with his whirling sticks and
every piper blowing his loudest and marching his proudest Behind them
came the men of the battalion marching at attention their colonel at
their head grave of face and steady Behind the colonel marched Major
Bayne in place of the senior major whom illness had prevented from
accompanying the battalion on this last tour no longer rotund and
cheery as was his wont but with face grey serious and deep lined
After him at the head of A Company marched Captain Duff his rugged
heavy face looking thinner and longer than its wont but even fiercer
than ever With eyes that looked straight before then heedless of the
line of silent onlookers the men marched on something in their set
haggard faces forbidding applause At the rear of the column marched the
chaplain alone and every one knew that he had left up in the Salient
behind him his friend and comrade the M O whose place in all other
marching had been at his right hand All knew too how during this last
go in the face of death in its most terrifying form they had carried
out their wounded comrades one by one until all were brought to safety
And all knew too how the chaplain carried with him that day a sore and
lonely heart for the loss of one who was more to him than batman and
who had become his loyal and devoted friend The chaplains face was
gaunt and thin with hollow cheeks but for all that it wore a look of
serene detachment

Say he looks awful tough said a voice in Sergeant Mackays ear

Sergeant Mackay turned sharply around upon Fatty Matthews

Tough Tough he exclaimed with a choke in his voice Youre a
damned liar thats what you are He looks fine He looks fine he
added again furiously He looks as if hell itself couldnt scare him

In the sergeants eyes strange lights were glistening

Yes youre right sergeant said Fatty Matthews humbly Youre
right and thats where hes been too I guess

Bravely and gallantly with the historic and immortal Cock o the
North shrilling out on the evening air the pipers played them on to
the battalion parade ground where they halted silent still and with
that strange air of detached indifference still upon them They had been
through hell Nothing else could surprise them All else indeed seemed
paltry

Briefly but with heartreaching words the colonel thanked the pipers
for what he called an act of fine and brotherly courtesy Then turning
to his men he spoke a few words before dismissal

Men you have passed through a long and hard time of testing You have
not failed I am not going to praise you but I want you to know that
I am proud of you Proud to be your commanding officer I know that
whatever is before us you will show the same spirit of endurance and
courage

We have lost this time twentynine men eleven of them killed and with
these three very brave and very gallant officers among them our medical
officer a very great loss to this battalion These men did their duty
to the last We loved them We shall miss them but today we are proud
of them Let us give three cheers for our gallant dead

With no joyous outburst but with a note of fierce strained
determination came the cheers In spite of all he could do Barry could
not prevent a shudder as he heard the men about him cheering for those
whom he had so recently seen lying some of them sorely mutilated in
their grey blankets

Now men concluded the O C we must carry on You will have a
couple of hours in which to clean up and have supper and then we shall
have tonight a cinema show to which I hope you will all come and
which I hope you will all greatly enjoy

The colonels little speeches as a rule elicited appreciative cheers
but this afternoon there was only a grave silence After dismissal the
men went to their huts and were soon busy giving themselves a high mark
scrub preliminary to the hot bath and jungle hunt in which they would
indulge themselves tomorrow

As Barry was moving off the parade ground the junior major caught up to
him and took him by the arm and said

I have sent around my batman to your hut He will look after you until
I can pick out a man from the new draft We all know how you feel about
Hobbs old man

Thank you major said Barry quietly I appreciate that

You will be around tonight continued the major

No I think not I have a lot of things to do All those letters to
write Barry shuddered as he spoke For nothing in all his ministerial
experience was to him a more exhausting and heartbreaking task than
the writing of these letters to the relatives and friends of his dead
comrades

I think you had better come said the major earnestly I know the O
C would like it and the boys would like it too

Do you think so said Barry Then Ill be there

Good man said Major Bayne patting him on the shoulder Thats the
stuff we like in this battalion

Barry found his hut in order his things out for airing his tub ready
and supper in preparation

Thanks Monroe he said to Major Baynes batman as he passed into his
hut

As he entered his hut and closed the door for the first time there
swept over his soul an appalling and desolating sense of loneliness It
was his first moment of quiet his first leisure to think of himself for
almost two weeks With the loss of his batman there had been snapped
the last link with that old home life of his now so remote but all the
dearer for that It came to him that while he remained a soldier this
was to be his continual experience Upon his return from every tour
new gaps would stare at him Up in the lines they did not so terribly
obtrude themselves but back here in rest billets they thrust themselves
upon him like hideous mutilations upon a well loved face He could
hardly force himself to remove his muddy filthy clothes He would
gladly have laid himself down upon his cot just as he was and given
himself up to the luxury of his grief and loneliness until sleep should
come but his life as a soldier had taught him something These months
of discipline and especially these last months of companionship with
his battalion through the terrible experiences of war had wrought into
the very fibre of his life a sense of unity with and responsibility for
his comrades His every emotion of loss of grief of heartsickness
carried with it the immediate suggestion and remembrance that his
comrades too were passing through a like experience and this was his
salvation Weary sick desolate as he felt himself in this hour he
remembered that many of his comrades were as he weary and sick and
desolate He wondered how the majors batman felt

Well Monroe he said with an attempt at a voice of cheer pretty
tough go this time

Yes sir very tough said Monroe I lost my chum this time he
added after a few moments silence

Poor chap said Barry Im awfully sorry for you Its hard to leave
a friend up there

It is that sir replied Monroe and then he added hurriedly but with
hesitation and if you will pardon me sir we all know its awful
tough for you The boys all feel for you sir believe me

The unexpected touch of sympathy was too much for Barrys selfcontrol
A rush of warm tears came to his eyes and choked his voice For some
minutes he busied himself with his undressing but Monroe continued
speaking

Yes sir the Wapiti bunch is getting pretty small Corporal Thom was
with me

Corporal Thom cried Barry Was Corporal Thom your chum

Yes sir for six years we was on the Bar U M together We was awful
close friends He was a good chum

Corporal Thom exclaimed Barry again he was your chum He was a
great friend of mine too You have indeed suffered a great loss

He thought a lot of you sir said Monroe He has often talked to me
about you

But what a splendid death cried Barry Perfectly glorious

I didnt hear sir said Monroe I came down three days ago and only
heard that a bomb got him

Oh splendid said Barry Nothing finer in the war Let me tell you
about it There was an enemy raid coming up The corporal had got wind
of it and called his men out They rushed into the front line bay Just
as they got there eight or ten of them a live bomb fell hissing among
them They all rushed to one end of the bay but the corporal kicked the
bomb to the other end and then threw himself on top of it He was blown
to pieces but no one else was hurt

During the recital of this tale Monroe stood looking at Barry and when
he had finished his eyes were shining with tears

Ay sir he was a man sir he said at length

Yes you have said it Monroe He was a man just a common man but
uncommonly like God for He did the same thing He gave Himself for us

Monroe turned away to his work in silence

Monroe said Barry calling him back look here lad it would not
be right for us to grieve too much for Corporal Thom We ought to be
thankful for him and proud of him should we not

Yes sir I know sir but he added while his lip trembled you hate
to lose your chum

Only under compulsion of his conscience did Barry go to the cinema show
that night which in this camp was run under the chaplain service and by
a chaplain He knew what the thing would be like His whole soul shrunk
from the silly melodramatic films which he knew would constitute the
programme as from a nauseating dose of medicine The billboard announced
a double header a trite and especially to Canadians a ridiculous
representation of the experiences of John Bull and his wife and pretty
daughter as immigrants to the Canadian Northwest which was to be
followed by the immortal Charlie Chaplin

The cinema hut was jammedthe whole battalion now much reduced in
numbers officers and men being present and with them the men of the
base units and transports of other battalions It was in some senses an
unusual gathering There was an entire absence of the wonted chaff and
uproarious horseplay instead a grave and almost bored air rested upon
the mens faces The appalling experiences of the past thirteen days
seemed to dwarf all other things in comparison They had been in the
presence of the Big Thing all else seemed petty they had been looking
into deaths cold eyes after that other sights seemed trivial Many of
them carried sore hearts for their comrades with whom they had at other
times foregathered in just such circumstances as these but nevermore
again

It was the custom in the battalion as the officers came into such
gatherings as this to receive them with a ripple of applause but
tonight there was silence Barry arrived late When he appeared there
fell upon the men a hush and then as he moved toward the front seats
reserved for the officers the men began to rise until the whole
battalion was standing silent and motionless and so remained until he
had found a seat It was Major Bayne who called his attention to this
unusual demonstration which was reserved only for great occasions and
for nothing less than a battalion commander

They are saluting you Pilot said Major Bayne in a whisper himself
standing with the other officers

Barry quickly lifted his eyes saw the men standing with all eyes
directed toward him slowly looked over the rows of faces smiled a
bright but slightly wavering smile turned and saluted the Commanding
Officer and sat down all trembling and shaken by this most touching
tribute of sympathy and affection

The show began with some pictures of great allied leaders which excited
a mild interest and drew some perfunctory applause Then came the tragic
comedy of John Bulls experiences as an immigrant when just as the
interest began to deepen the machine blew up and the pictures were off
for the night

Ordinarily such a contretemps would have been by no means fatal to the
evenings enjoyment for in the battalion there was no lack of musical
and other talent and an impromptu entertainment was easily possible
Ordinarily too in such an emergency there would at once have arisen
a demand for the chaplain who had come to be recognised as a great
standby in times of need such as this Tonight however everything
seemed changed The mild suggestion of one of the men that the chaplain
should take the piano was promptly discouraged by the dissenting growls
of the others present They knew well how their chaplain was feeling

What shall we do asked Major Bayne of Barry

Get Coleman to the piano He is a perfect wizard suggested Barry
indicating a young lieutenant who had come to the battalion with the
recent draft and who had done some accompaniments for Barrys violin
playing

Lieutenant Coleman on being called for went to the piano and began
to play He was indeed a wizard as Barry had said with a genius for
ragtime and popular music hall ditties and possessed also of the
further gift of improvisation that made his services invaluable on just
such an occasion as this

From one popular air to another he wandered each executed with greater
brilliance than the last but he failed to excite anything more than a
mild interest and approval The old songs which on other occasions had
been wont to let loose the song birds of the battalion seemed to have
lost their power It was not gloom but a settled and immovable apathy
which apparently nothing could break

This is going awfully slow said Major Bayne to Barry I wish
something could be done

The boys are tired out answered Barry himself weary and sick of the
performance and longing more than anything else for solitude and his
cot

The Commanding Officer came over and sat beside them He was obviously
worried and uneasy

I dont like this he said to the major Coleman is doing his best
and is doing mighty well but there is no heart in the boys and it
isnt entirely due to physical weakness I wish we could start something
that would wake them up before they leave They would sleep much
better

The Pilot here can do it said Major Bayne in an undertone but I
rather hate to ask him for he is pretty much all in

They sat a little while longer listening to the mens half hearted
drawling of The Tulip and the Rose

This wont do said the O C abruptly Get Dunbar over here

Dunbar said the O C when Barry had come to him This thing is as
dull as ditchwater I want to get the boys started up a bit They are
hopelessly dull Look at their eyes Do you know what they are seeing

Yes sir said Barry they are seeing what they have been looking at
for the last thirteen days

You are right Dunbar and thats what I want them to forget Now I
know you dont feel very fit and I hate to ask you but I believe you
can do something for the men with that violin of yours What do you
say

I have already sent a man for it said Major Bayne I knew hed do
it and his violin lies there under the piano

Without announcement or preface Barry walked straight to the stage where
Coleman having miserably failed to strike fire with The Tulip and the
Rose was grinding out with great diligence and conscientious energy
Irish Eyes Barry picked up his violin from the floor mounted the
stage laid his violin on the piano then he took his place behind the
pianist and bending over him reached down caught him under the legs
and while still in full tide of his performance lifted him squarely off
the stool and deposited him upon a chair at one side of the stage Then
ignoring the amazed look upon Colemans face he proceeded gravely to
tune his violin to the piano The act itself the cool neatness with
which it was performed the astonished face of the outraged pianist
all together created a situation excessively funny The effect upon
the audience was first one of surprise then of unalloyed delight
Immediately every man in the hall was wide awake and as the humour
of the situation grew upon them they began to cheer in quite a lively
manner

When Barry put his violin to his chin they cheered again for often had
he bewitched them with the magic of his instrument

Before he began to play he glanced over his shoulder at the discomfited
Coleman and remarked in an undertone perfectly audible throughout the
hall Now well have some music

Again the audience went off in a perfect storm of delighted cheers
which were renewed from time to time as Barry would turn looking with a
grave face upon the still amazed Coleman not yet quite recovered from
his first astonishment

When quiet was finally restored Barry began to play For his opening
number he made a daring choice It was the intricate but altogether
tuneful Ballade and Polonaise by Vieuxtemps Throughout the somewhat
lengthy number he held his audience fixed under the mastery of his art
It was a triumph immediate and complete When he had finished the
last brilliant movement of the Polonaise the men burst again into
enthusiastic cheering moved not only by the music but more by the
spirit of their chaplain which they could not fail to understand and
appreciate

He had already achieved what the O C had desired but he was not yet
done with them Having finished his classical selection which he was
quite well aware Coleman could not touch he turned to the latter and
gravely motioned him to the piano stool Coleman hesitated not knowing
quite what would be demanded of him

Come on Coleman be a sport shouted a young officer the audience
joining once more in encouraging cheers

Still Coleman hesitated One never knew just what vagary the chaplain
might put on Failing to move him by imploring gesture Barry finally
approached him and with elaborate courteous formality offered him his
hand and finally conducted him to the piano stool Again the delighted
audience went into a roar of cheers

From that moment and for a full hour Barry had them at his will now
listening spellbound to some simple old heart song now beating hand and
foot to a reel now roaring to the limit of their lung power some old
and wellloved popular air

Aint he a bird said the major to the Commanding Officer

Hes fine assented the Commanding Officer with a great sigh I cant
tell you what a burden he has lifted from me Its worth a weeks rest
to the men and poor chaps they need it Lowering his voice he
leaned over to the major and said We may be going up again tomorrow
night

Tomorrow night colonel exclaimed the major aghast

Not a word but I have exceedingly grave news The front line is driven
in One of the battalions holding is completely wiped out

Wiped out Good God and where are the enemy

As far as I can hear although I havent the particulars they have
broken through from Hooge to Hill 60 are through Sanctuary Wood and
down to Maple Copse Two relief battalions have gone up and are holding
The chances are we shall have to go to back them up tomorrow evening
Its hard on the boys for they have come through a long and bitter
experience but not a word of this major to any one We shall let
them have their rest tonight Thats why I was so anxious about this
entertainment Thats why I am particularly grateful to that Pilot of
ours He is a wonder and by the look of him he is about all in He is
staying magnificently with the game And now major I am going to do
something that will please him immensely At least I think it will

At a pause in the music the O C arose and moved toward the stage
Barry at once stepped back to the rear Standing before the men the O
C spoke briefly

I wish to thank in your name men our chaplain and his assistant Mr
Coleman for the very delightful evening they have given us I know how
you feel by the way I feel myself I need say no more and now seeing
that we have missed our parade service for the last two Sundays and as
I should not like the chaplain to become rusty in his duty Im going
to ask him to bring our very pleasant evening to a close with a little
service such as he himself would suggest

Hardly were the words out of his mouth when Barry took up his violin
and said

Boys did you have a good time tonight

Yes sir you bet we had sir

Well then if you had sing this and recited for them the first
verses of the old hymn


Abide with me fast falls the even tide


When they had sung the first verse he said again

Now sing these words and once more he recited the stirring verse


I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless


When they had finished the verse he said to them

Shall we have another

Go on sir they said Sure thing Finish it up

Then said Barry sing these words


 I need Thy presence every passing hour
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempters power


Then when he had finished the verse he dropped the violin and moving
to the edge of the platform said in a voice vibrant with emotion

Dont sing these words but say them as I play them for you

He then recited the moving words with which the old hymn closes


 Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
 Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
 Heavens morning breaks and earths vain shadows flee
 In life in death O Lord abide with me


I want every one of you to say the words to himself as I play them

In longdrawn tremulous notes he voiced the beautiful plea for aid in
the hour of mans supreme need which finds expression in the first
two lines Then with his bow gripping the strings in a great sweeping
crescendo he poured forth in full strong chords the triumphant faith
with which the hymn closes

He laid his violin on the piano stood quite a few moments looking upon
them then said

Men listen to these great words They might have been written for
us and for these days and he recited to them the words of the Hebrew
psalm eloquent of courage in the face of a crumbling world


God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble

Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the
mountains be carried into the midst of the sea

Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains
shake with the swelling thereof Selah

There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God
the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High

God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her
and that right early

The heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the
earth melted

The Lord of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge Selah

Come behold the words of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the
earth

He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow
and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire

Be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heathen I
will be exalted in the earth

The Lord of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge


Then they followed him in the General Confession and the Lords prayer

Captain Dunbar said the O C offering him his hand you have
done for us tonight a greater thing than you know just now You will
understand better tomorrow With all my heart I thank you on the mens
behalf and on my own behalf for I assure you I needed it as much as
they did I want to assure you too sir that I received tonight the
thing I needed

Thank you sir said Barry simply too weary to utter another word
and staggered out half dead with exhaustion

Half an hour later as he was leisurely undressing and drinking the cup
of cocoa which Monroe had prepared for him a message summoned him to
the orderly room There he found Colonel Leighton with Major Bayne and
the company commanders

I have a communication here for you Captain Dunbar said the O C
from your D A C S and he passed him a little slip

It was the announcement of his leave

Well what do you think of that said the O C How does that suit
you

Well sir said Barry uncertainty and hesitation in his voice Id
like the leave all right but can I conveniently be spared just now

Most certainly said the O C and whats more I want you to go
tonight Can you get ready

I suppose so sir said Barry wearily

By Jove listen to him said the O C He hates to leave us doesnt
he And they all laughed Now Dunbar he said no more posing You
catch the leave train tonight at Poperinghe As a matter of fact I
think it starts somewhere about twelve

Thank you sir said Barry I think I can catch it

Then good luck said the O C rising from his chair Every one
of us here would like to be in your place but since it isnt himself
every man is glad that it should be you

Still Barry hesitated

I really hate to leave you sir just now he said I mean that he
added with a little nervous laugh

Oh come on Dunbar said the O C in a voice whose gruffness might
signify almost any emotion but with a touch upon his shoulder that
Barry knew meant comradeship Say goodbye to the boys here and get
out

They had just finished the plan for the campaign of the next night and
every man in that little company knew that for him this might be his
last Goodbye to the chaplain It only added to the depth of their
feeling that they knew that of all this Barry was unconscious But
whether it was that unconsciously he had gathered something of the real
significance of the situation or whether it was that he himself had
reached the limit of emotional control as he passed from man to man
shaking hands in farewell his lips refused to utter a single word but
in his eyes were unshed tears that spoke for him

Major Bayne followed him to the door and outside

Take my horse and Monroe with you and goodbye old man All sorts of
good luck Remember that we all feel tonight that you are really one of
us and that we are better men because we have known you Goodbye

Again Barry was conscious of that strange suggestion almost of
impending calamity

I hate to go major he said I believe Ill wait

Nonsense said the major impatiently Take your leave when you get
your chance and have a good time You have earned it



CHAPTER XVI

THE PASSING OF McCUAIG


At Poperinghe the leave train was waiting in the station and a
little company of officers and men were having their papers examined
preparatory to their securing transportation Some of the officers were
from his own brigade and were known to Barry

A big push on at the front I hear said one of them to a friend

Yes major said his friend They have been having a perfect hell of
a time

By the way your men are going in tomorrow I understand said the
major turning to Barry

I dont think so major replied Barry We have just come out

Oh well I had it from fairly good authority that they were going in
tomorrow night

Barry hunted up Monroe whom he found talking to a signaller of the
battalion

Did you boys hear anything about the battalion going up tomorrow

Yes sir said the signaller promptly We had it over the wires They
are going in all right tomorrow night

Monroe kicked the signaller on the ankle

Did you hear anything about it Monroe enquired Barry

No sir I dont believe these rumours at all They are always flying
about

But you say you got it over the wires said Barry to the signaller

Yes sir That is sir of course we get a lot of messages Perhaps
Im mixed up said the signaller in very evident confusion

And you havent heard anything Monroe said Barry

No sir not a thing and I think I would have heard if there had been
any truth in it

Something in the childlike expression of innocence upon Monroes face
wakened Barrys suspicion

Look here Monroe he said dont lie to me Now Im talking to you
as your chaplain Tell me the truth Have you heard of the battalion
going in tomorrow

Under Barrys eye Monroe began to squirm

Well sir to tell you the truth I did hear a rumour of that kind

And you said Barry turning upon the signaller tell me the truth

Well sir its just as I said We had it over the wires The battalion
is going in

Very well get my stuff Monroe said Barry quietly Im going
back

I beg your pardon sir

Do you hear me Get my stuff Im not going out tonight Barrys tone
admitted no further talk and Monroe swearing deeply at his friend the
signaller and at his own stupidity and especially at his own lack
of nerve to see his lie through hunted out Barrys baggage and stood
ready for his officer to return

Hello Dunbar said the major as he saw Barry about to mount his
horse Whats up Forgotten something Youll surely miss your train

Im not going said Barry briefly getting himself settled in his
saddle

Not going exclaimed the major What do you mean I thought you were
on leave

Changed my mind said Barry cheerfully

I say old man said the major there may be nothing in what I told
you about the push Anyway you know we cannot postpone our leave until
all the fighting is over

Oh thats all right replied Barry There are lots of you combatant
chaps in a battalion but there is only one chaplain

Oh hang it all cried the major take your leave Well seeing that
Barry paid no heed to his advice the best of luck old man he said
offering his hand I guess youre all right after all

The exhilaration that had sustained Barry during the evening suddenly
fled leaving him flat in spirit and limp in body What he wanted most
of all was sleep and morning was not so far away He rode back to his
hut and bidding Monroe let him sleep all day he tumbled into bed and
knew nothing until late in the afternoon Monroe too had slept in
and after rising had been busy about the hut so that he had no
further information as to the battalions movements The chaplains hut
was some distance from Headquarters and from the battalion camp Hence
it came that while Barry was writing hard at his letters throughout
the remainder of the afternoon he was quite unaware of what was taking
place Monroe however returned about six oclock to say that the
battalion had been standing to all afternoon but that the general
feeling was that there would be no advance until late at night

Glad of the opportunity to catch up with his correspondence Barry paid
little heed to the passing of time His last letter was to the V A D
in which he poured out the bitterness of his disappointment that he was
not even now on his way to Boulogne and to her and expressing the hope
that after this show was over he would be granted leave upon
which happy event he would with all speed proceed to her She had been
speaking of a trip to England Would it not be a very wise and proper
proceeding that she should make her leave to synchronise with his Now
he must be off and so with love to her and with the hope that they
might see London together

Just then Monroe came with the startling news that the battalion had
moved up hours ago

Which road enquired Barry springing to his feet

Dont know sir replied Monroe who had evidently his own opinion
about matters But I met a padre he continued who told me that
there was a stream of wounded passing through the Brandhoek Clearing
Station He said they were very shorthanded there sir and Monroe
regarded his officer with anxious eyes

I hate to take you up there Monroe said Barry with a smile

Oh thats all right sir said Monroe hastily but I guess well
have to hurry

I remember Monroe that your major and you would have sent me out
of this but you know well enough that theres only one place for me
tonight and the question is where is the battalionYpres Barracks
Chateau Beige Zillebeck or where

I enquired at the transports sir said Monroe and no one appeared
to know They moved out quietly and left no word behind

All right well go up to Chateau Belge and if they are not there
well make a shot at Zillebeck said Barry Well go right away We
dont need a lot of truck this trip

It was a long and tiresome march but Barry found himself remarkably
fit and already under the exhilaration of what was before him At
the Chateau Belge they found no word of their battalion but they were
informed that the shelling on the Kruisstraat road had been bad all
afternoon and was still going on The Boches were paying particular
attention indeed to the crossroads

All right said Barry Well go up and have a look at it anyway

A hundred yards further up the road they were held up by a sudden burst
of H E shells which fell in near proximity to the crossroads before
them

Well well just wait here a few minutes until we can time these
things said Barry sitting down by the roadside

As they were waiting there three soldiers passed them at quick march

Better wait boys called Barry they are dropping quite a few shells
at the crossroads

We are runners sir said one of them I guess well just take a
chance thank you sir

All right boys if you think best replied Barry Good luck

Thank you sir they said and set off at a smart pace

While Barry sat listening to the sound of their footsteps upon the
pavement there came that terrific whine followed by an appalling
crash as a H E shell landed full upon the road Barry sprang to his
feet Three other shells followed in quick succession then there came
the sound of hurrying feet and a man appeared bleeding horribly and
gasping

Oh my God My God They are gone They are gone

Sit down said Barry Now wheres your wound

My arm sir said the man

Barry cut off the bloodsoaked sleeve ripped open his first aid
dressing and bound the wound up tightly Then he put a tourniquet upon
the arm above the wound

The other boys killed you say he inquired

Yes sir blown to pieces Oh my God he groaned shuddering My
chums whole head was blown off and the other has his belly all torn
up

Now look here old man said Barry you lie down here where you are
and keep perfectly still for the man was throwing himself about more
from shock than from pain Well get you to the dressing station in a
few minutes Monroe run and get the stretcher bearers and Ill go and
see how things are up yonder

He threw his coat over the wounded man and set off at a run toward the
crossroads He found matters as the man had said the two bodies lying
in a dark patch of bloodsoaked dust one with head quite blown off and
the other with abdomen horribly torn

He hurried back to the wounded man who had recovered somewhat from his
shock and was now lying on his side quietly moaning Barry got from him
the names and units of the men who had been killed

I will drop a note to your mother too my boy he said and tell her
about your wound

Oh sir said the boy quicklyhe was only a boy after alldont
tell herat least tell her Im all right Ill be all right wont I

Sure thing said Barry dont you fear I wont alarm her and Ill
tell her what good stuff you are boy

All right sir Thank you sir said the boy quietly

And Ill tell her too that you are not worrying a bit and that you
know that you are in the keeping of your Heavenly Father How is that

Yes sir said the boy in a low voice I will be glad to have you
tell her that She taught me all that sir Poor mother shell worry
though I know he added with a little catch in his throat

Now you brace up said Barry firmly You have got off mighty well
You have got a nice little blighty there and you are going to be all
right Ill give your mother the best report about you so that she
wont worry

Oh thank you said the boy with fervent gratitude that will be
fine And you are right he added a note of resolution coming into
his voice I got off mighty well and its only my left arm thank
goodness Ill brace up sir never fear he added between his teeth
choking back a groan

Barry accompanied the stretcherbearer back to the chateau and gave the
man over into the care of the C A M C

Can you put a squad on to digging a grave he inquired of the officer
in charge If so though Im in an awful hurry Ill stay to bury those
poor chaps

Sure thing we can said the officer Well do the very best we can
to hurry it

In about an hour and a half Barry was on his way again He dodged
the shelling at the crossroads and following a track across the open
fields arrived at the Zillebeck Bund without adventure

Here to his relief he found the battalion He made his way at once to
Headquarters and walked in upon a meeting of officers

Well Im exclaimed Colonel Leighton checking himself hard who
have we here What in hell are you doing here Pilot I thought you
would be safely in old Blighty by this time he added shaking him
warmly by the hand

Oh you couldnt work that game on me colonel said Barry cheerily
going round the group of men who gave him an eager welcome You
thought you had shipped me off just as the fun was starting but I got
on to you

Well Ill be darned said Major Bayne How did you find out

Barry told him adding You will have to train your man to lie more
cheerfully

Thats what comes of a mans environment said the major disgustedly
I was always too truthful anyway

Well sir said Barry turning to the colonel Im awfully glad to
find you here I was afraid Id lost you

Well gentlemen said the colonel you have all got your orders Does
any one want to ask a question Well then its pretty simple after
all Two companies advance as far as Maple Copse and gradually work up
until they feel the enemy then put in a block and hold against attack
at all costs The other two companies are to follow up in support at
Zillebeck Village Later on when our reserves come up and when our
guns returnI hear they are pushing them up rapidlywe are promised
a go at those devils Meantime we have got to hold on but I expect the
battalion will be pulled out very shortly

The flickering candles lit up the faces of the men crowding the dugout
They were elaborately careless and jolly but their eyes belied their
faces Under the careless air there was a tense and stern look of
expectation They were all sportsmen and had all experienced the
anxious nervous thrill of the moments preceding a big contest Once the
ball was off their nervousness would go and they would be cool and
wary playing the game for all they had in them

Now gentlemen said the colonel as they prepared to leave the
dugout before I let you go there is one thing I want to say Its a
tradition of the British army that any soldier or officer who has lost
his unit marches toward the sound of the guns I am proud tonight that
we have an example of that old tradition here We left our chaplain
behind and he didnt know where his battalion had gone but he moved
toward the sound of the guns That is what I would expect from any
of you gentlemen but its none the less gratifying to find ones
expectations realised

Only his flaming face revealed Barrys emotion as the colonel was
speaking

Now then gentlemen carry on and the best of luck

Sir said Barry what about a little prayer

Fine said the colonel heartily while round the room there ran a
murmur of approval

Barry pulled out his little Bible and read not one of the fighting
psalms but the tenderly exquisite words of the Shepherds song His
voice was clear steady and ringing with cheery confidence His prayer
was in the spirit of the psalm breathing high courage and calm trust
even in the presence of the ultimate issue

In a single sentence he commended his comrades to the keeping of the
Eternal God of Truth and Justice and Mercy asking that they might be
found steadfast in their hour of testing and worthy of their country and
their cause

Together they joined in the Lords prayer then lifting over them his
hands he closed the little service with that ancient and beautiful
formula of blessing which for two thousand years has sent men out from
the Holy Place of Meeting to face with hearts resolved whatever life
might hold for them

One by one as they passed out the officers shook hands with Barry
thanking him for the service and expressing their delight that he was
with them again

What are we going to do with you Pilot inquired the colonel

I thought Id stick around with the boys said Barry

Well said the colonel gravely of course theres no use of your
going up to the attack You would only be in the way You would be an
embarrassment to the officers That reminds me there was a call from
Menin Mill for you this afternoon They are having an awful rush there
Our own R A P will be in Zillebeck Village and our Headquarters will
be there

Ill go there sir if you agree said Barry and after some
discussion the matter was so arranged

In a ruined cellar in the village of Zillebeck a mile and a half
further in the R A P was established and there carried on during
the desperate fighting of the next three days Through this post a
continuous stream of wounded passed the stretcher cases all night the
walking cases all day and all night In spite of its scenes of horror
and suffering the R A P was a cheery spot The new M O was strange
to his front line business but he was of the right stuff cool quick
with his fingers and undisturbed by the crashing of bursting shells
The stretcher bearers and even the wounded maintained an air of resolute
cheeriness that helped to make bearable what otherwise would have been
a nightmare of unspeakable horror Attached to the R A P was an outer
building wherein the wounded men were laid after treatment Thither in a
pause of his work Barry would run to administer drinks ease the strain
of an awkward position speak a word of cheer say a prayer or sing
snatches of a hymn or psalm There was little leisure for reflection
nor if there had been would he have indulged in reflection knowing well
that only thus could he maintain his selfcontrol and carry on

With each wounded man there came news of the progress of the fighting
The boys were holding splendidly indeed were gradually eating into
the enemy front They brought weird stories of his comrades incidents
pathetic humorous heroic according to the temperament of the
narrator But from more than one source came tales of Knights machine
gun section to which McCuaig was attached Knight himself had been
killed soon after entering the line and about his men conflicting tales
were told they were holding a strong point they were blown up
they had shifted their position they were wiped out they were still
carrying on McCuaig was the hero of every tale He was having the
time of his life He had gone quite mad He was for going out and over
alone

The first authentic account came with young Pickles now a runner who
made his way hobbling to Headquarters with a message from A Company and
who reported that he had fallen in with McCuaig by the way and by
him had been commandeered to carry ammunition under threat of instant
death

Where did you see McCuaig first Pickles Barry inquired anxious to
learn the truth about his friend

Way up Lovers Walk said young Pickles who was in high spirits
under a pile of brush and trees I though it was a wildcat or
something moving and snarlingthe light was kind of dimand when I
went up there was McCuaig He was alone Two or three men were lying
near him dead I guess and he was swearing and talking to himself
something fierce I was scart stiff when he called me to him I went
over and he says to me Say youngster just like that you know
where this walk used to drop down into the trench Well theres a lot
of machine gun ammunition over there all fixed up and ready You go
and bring it up here I tried to get out of it sayin I was bringing
a hurry up message down but he turns his machine gun on me and says
Young man its only a couple of hundred yards down there and fairly
good cover They cant see you Go and bring that stuff here If you
dont Ill blow you to hell just where you stand You bet I promised
I got that ammunition so quick Oh of course hes crazy all right
said young Pickles but he is fighting like hell I beg pardon sir

Doctor Im going after him said Barry He will stay there until he
bleeds to death He is my oldest friend

All right padre if you say so said the M O but its a nasty
job I should not care for it

Barry knew the area thoroughly He got from young Pickles an exact
description of the location of the spot where McCuaig had last been
seen and with the returning stretcher bearers set off for the wood
which was about a thousand yards further on

The communication trench leading up to the wood which had been
constructed with such care and of which the Canadians were so proud had
been blown up from end to end by the systematic and thorough bombardment
of the three days before The little party therefore were forced to
make their way overland by the light of the star shells

They reached the wood in safety Barry looked about him in utter
bewilderment Every familiar feature of the landscape was utterly
blotted out The beautiful ambrosial wood itself of heavy trees and
thick tinderbrush was a mat of tangled trunks above which stood
splintered stubs Not a tree not a branch hardly a green leaf was
left Under that mat of fallen trunks were A and C Companies somewhere
holding blocking feeling up toward the Hun

The shells were whining overhead going out and coming in but mostly
coming in None however were falling on the wood because here friend
and foe were lying almost within bayonet length of each other Only an
occasional burst from a machine gun broke the silence that hung over
this place of desolation and death

Thats the company Headquarters said the stretcher bearer pointing
to what looked like a bear den under some fallen trees Barry pushed
aside the blanket and poking his head in found Duff and a young
lieutenant working at a table by the light of a guttering candle

For the love of God Pilot exclaimed Duff springing up and gripping
Barrys hand its good to see you but what are you doing here

I came up for McCuaig said Barry after a warm greeting to both

Oh say thats good We have got him as far as the next dugout here
the old bear Ive been trying to get him out for half a day Theres a
soldier for you Hes been potting Boches with his blessed machine gun
scouting from one hole to another for the last two days and hes got a
nasty wound Im awfully glad you have come

How are things going Duff

We have got the s so that they cant move a foot and well hold
them unless they bring up a lot of reserves

By Jove Duff you boys are wonderful

I say said Duff brushing aside the compliment did young Pickles
get through That young devil is the limit Youd have thought he was
hunting coyotes

Yes he got through Got a blighty though I guess It was he that told
me about McCuaig

Well Pilot old man said Duff taking him by the arm get out
Get out Dont waste time There may be a break any minute Get out of
here

Duff was evidently in a fever of anxiety You had no right to come up
here anyway though by Jove Im glad to see you

Whats the fuss Duff said Barry Am I in any more danger than you
I say he continued with tense enthusiasm do you realise Duff that
as long as Canada lasts they will talk of what you are doing up here
these days

For Heavens sake Pilot get out said Duff crossly You make me
nervous Besides you have got to get that wounded man out you know
Come along

He hustled Barry out and over to the neighbouring dugout where they
found McCuaig with his beloved machine gun still at his side The
wounded man was very pale but extremely cheerful smoking a cigarette

Im glad to see you sir he said quietly reaching out his hand

Good old man said Barry gripping his hand hard but you are a
blamed old fool you know

McCuaig made no reply but there was a happy light on his face Under
Duffs compelling urging they got the wounded man on a stretcher and
started on their long and painful carry

Now boys warned Duff you are all right up here except for machine
guns but dont take any chances further out Thats where the danger
is When the shells come dont rush things Take your time Now
goodbye Pilot its worth a lot to have seen you anyway

Goodbye old man said Barry smiling at him Youre the stuff Good
luck old man God keep you

Duff nodded and waved him away The return trip was made in comparative
quiet

What do you think doctor said Barry after the M O had completed
his examination

Oh well pull him through all right said the M O When did you get
this McCuaig he continued touching a small wound over the kidney

Dunno rightly Guess I got it when we was blown up yesterday

Then why didnt you come in at once inquired the M O indignantly

McCuaig looked at him in mild surprise

Why they was all blown up and there wasnt anybody to run the gun

The M O examined the wound more closely and shook his head at Barry

We wont touch that now Well just bandage it up Are you feeling
pretty comfortable

Fine said McCuaig with cheerful satisfaction We held them up
I guess They thought they was going to walk right over us They was
comin with their packs on their backs But the boys changed their minds
for them I guess

A reminiscent smile lingered upon the long eaglelike face

Half an hour later Barry found a minute to run into the adjoining room
where the wounded lay

Anything you want McCuaig he asked

A drink if you aint too busy but I hate to take your time

Oh you go to thunder said Barry Take my time What am I for Any
pain Mac

No not much Im a little sleepy

Barry turned the flashlight on his face He was startled to find it
grey and drawn He brought the M O who examined the wounded mans
condition

No pain eh Mac

No sir said McCuaig cheerfully

All right boy just lie still said the M O beckoning Barry after
him

He is going out he said when they reached the dressing room and
hes going fast That wound in the back has been bleeding a long time

Oh doctor cant anything be done You know hes got a remarkable
constitution Cant something be done

There are times when a doctor wishes he had some other job said the
M O and this is one of them

I say doctor will you get along without me for a while said Barry

Go on said the M O nodding to him

Barry took a candle and went in beside his friend As he sat there
gazing upon the greying face the wounded man opened his eyes

That you Barry he asked with a quiet smile

Barry started Only in the very first weeks of their acquaintance had
McCuaig called him by his first name and never during the past months
had he used anything but his rank title Now all rank distinctions were
obliterated They were as man to man

Yes Mac its me Do you know what I was thinking about I was
thinking of the first time I saw you coming down that rapid in your
canoe

I remember well Barry I often think of it Its a long time ago
said McCuaig in his soft slow voice Ive never been sorry but once
that I come and that time it was my own fault but I didnt understand
the game

Youve made a great soldier Mac We are all proud of you said Barry
putting his hand upon McCuaigs McCuaigs long thin fingers tightened
upon Barrys hand

I think Im going out he said with his eyes on Barrys face What
do you think

It was the time for truth telling

Oh Mac old man said Barry putting his head down close to him to
hide from him the rush of tears that came to his eyes Im afraid you
are and I hate to have you go

Why Barry you crying for me asked McCuaig in a kind of wonder
Say boy Im awful glad you feel that way Somehow I dont feel quite
so lonely now

Oh Mac you are my oldest my best friend in the battalion in all the
world said Barry

Oh I just love to hear you say that boy Do you know I wanted to tell
you how I felt about that time on the boat you remember Barry nodded
Barry tell me honest Injun did I make good as a soldier

The best ever said Barry They all say so officers and men I heard
the colonel say so the other day

Again the smile came

Barry it was you that done that for me You showed me and you done it
so nice I never forgot that and I always wanted to tell you how I felt
about it Barry you done a lot for me

Oh Mac dont talk like that said Barry trying to keep his voice
steady I did so little and I wanted to do so much

Say I like to hear you Id like to stay a little longer just to be
with you Barry Ive watched you just like you was my own boy and Ive
been awful proud of you but I didnt like to say so

The uncovering of the great love of this simple humble hearted man
broke down Barrys selfcontrol He made no effort to check his falling
tears

Im gettingkind of weak Barry whispered McCuaig I guess I wont
be long mebbe

His words recalled Barrys nerve

Mac would you like me to say a prayer he asked Just as you feel
about it you know

YesI wouldbut I aintyour religionyou knowthoughI
likeawful wellthe wayyou talk aboutHim

I know you are R C Mac but after all you know we have just the one
Father in Heaven and the one Saviour

YesI know Barry Its all the same

Barry had a sudden inspiration

Wait Mac a minute he said

He hurried out to the dressing room seeking a crucifix but could find
none there

Ill run across to Headquarters he said

Say theres a machine gun playing that street awful said the M Os
sergeant to say nothing of whizzbangs

Oh thats all right said Barry Ill make a dash for it

But at Headquarters he was no more successful He went out into the
garden in the rear of the R A P and returned with two small twigs
The M O bound them together in the form of a cross Barry took it and
hastened to McCuaigs side

The hurried breathing and sunken cheeks of the wounded man showed that
the end was not far As Barry knelt beside him he opened his eyes
There was a look of distress upon his face which Barry understood God
was near And God was terrible He wanted his priest

Barry he whispered Ive notbeen a good man I havent beenmean
to anybodybut I usedto swearand fight and

Mac listen to me Were all the same said Barry in a quiet clear
voice Suppose Id injured you

You wouldntBarry

But suppose I did some real mean thing to you and then came and said I
was sorry would you forgive me

Would IId never thinkof anythingyou didto me Barry

Mac thats the way your Father in Heaven feels to you We have all
done wrong but He says I will blot out all your sins You neednt
fear to trust Him Mac

I guessthats so BarryI guess thatsall right

Yes its all right Now Ill say a prayer Look Mac

He held up the little wooden cross before his eyes A smile of joy and
surprise transfigured the dying face

I see itI seeit he whispered and made a movement with his lips
Barry laid the cross upon them and with that symbol of the Divine love
and of the Divine sacrifice pressed to the dying lips he prayed in
words such as a child might use

For some time after the prayer McCuaig lay with his eyes shut then
with a sudden accession of strength he opened them and looking up into
Barrys eyes said

Barry Im all right now    You helped me again

The long thin hands once of such iron strength began to wander weakly
over the blanket until touching Barrys they closed upon it and held
it fast

Iwontforgetyouever he whispered The nerveless fingers with
difficulty lifted Barrys hand to the cold lips GoodbyeBarry
he said

Goodbye dear old comrade Goodbye dear old friend said Barry in
a clear quiet voice gazing through his falling tears straight into the
dying eyes

Goodnight The whisper faded into silence A quiet smile lay on
the white face The eyes closed there was a little tired sigh and the
brave tender spirit passed on to join that noble company of immortals
who abide in the Presence of the Eternal God of Truth and Love and go
no more out forever because they are akin to Him

In the sorely tortured graveyard beside the little shellwrecked
Zillebeck church in a hole made by an enemy shell they laid McCuaiga
fitting resting place for one who had lived his days in the free wild
spaces of the Canadian west a fitting tomb for as gallant a soldier as
Canada ever sent forth to war to make the world free

That night the battalion was relieved Worn spent but with spirit
unbroken they crawled out from under that matted mass of tangled
trunks sending out their wounded before them and leaving their buried
dead behind them to hold with other Canadian dead the line which from
St Julien by Hooge Sanctuary Wood and Maple Copse and Mount Sorel
and Hill 60 and on to St Eloi guards the way to Ypres and to the sea
To Canada every foot of her great domain from sea to sea is dear but
while time shall last Canada will hold dear as her own that bloodsoaked
sacred soil which her dead battalions hold for Honour Faith and
Freedom



CHAPTER XVII

LONDON LEAVE AND PHYLLIS


The leave train pulled into the Boulogne station exactly twentysix
hours late As Barry stepped off the train he was met by the R T O
an old Imperial officer with a brisk and important military manner

You are the O C train sir he inquired

I am sir replied Barry saluting

You have had a hard time I understand said the R T O drawing him
off to one side and speaking in a low tone

Yes sir we HAVE had a hard time replied Barry at least the men
have This is my report sir

The R T O took the document opened it glanced hurriedly through it

Ah he said ninetyseven casualties thirteen fatal Very bad Six
burned This is truly terrible

There were only two soldiers burned sir replied Barry but it IS
terrible especially when you think that the men were going on leave and
were supposed to have got quit of the danger zone

Very very terrible said the officer You ran off the track I
understand

No sir it was a collision There must have been gross carelessness
sir said Barry I trust there will be an investigation I have taken
the liberty to suggest that sir in my report

Barrys voice was stern

You need have no apprehension on that score sir said the R T O
with his eyes still upon the report This is very clear and concise
I see you make no mention of your own services in connection with the
affair but others have I have had a most flattering telegram from
the officer commanding the R A M C as also from the Divisional
Commander mentioning your initiative and resourcefulness I assure you
this will not be forgotten I understand you are a padre

Yes sir replied Barry who was getting rather weary of the
conversation

All I have to say then sir is that the Canadian army must be rich in
combatant officers for if you will pardon me it strikes me that there
is a damned good combatant officer lost in you

If I were a better padre replied Barry I would be content

I fancy you have little ground for complaint on that score said the
R T O for the first time smiling at him

May I ask sir replied Barry if my responsibility ends here

Yes unless you want to take charge of the boat

Id rather not sir if you please How long before she sails

About three hours Have you anything to do

I should like to visit the R A M C hospital I should also like to
phone the American hospital at Etaples

Very well you can easily do both I will run you up in my car if you
care to wait a few moments until I put through some little matters here
Then if you will be good enough to join me at breakfast I can drive you
up afterwards to the hospital This is my car I think you had better
step in and sit down you look rather used up

Will you allow me to speak to some of the men first sir

Oh certainly Do anything you like There are your men

As Barry moved along the line of men drawn up on the platform he was
followed by a rising murmur of admiration until as he reached a group
of officers at the end a little Tommy an English cockney lifting high
his rifle sang out

Naow then lads eres to our O D adding after the cheers es a
bit ov ol raaght e is

Men said Barry I thank you for your cheers but I thank you more
for your splendid behaviour night before last It was beyond praise You
couldnt save all your comrades but you would willingly have given
your lives to save them Thats the true spirit of the Empire Its
the spirit of Humanity Its the spirit of God If I were a combatant
officer

Youd be a good un sir cried a voice

If I were a combatant officer I should like to lead men like you into
action

Wed follow you to ell sir shouted the little cockney

Oh I hope not replied Barry Im not going that way May I say in
wishing you every good luck that you are a credit to your country and
I can say nothing higher I wish to thank the officers who so splendidly
did their duty and gave such valuable service Good luck to you boys
and give my love to all at home

Again the men broke into cheers and Barry shaking hands with the
officers turned away toward the car As he was entering the car
Sergeant Matthews came over to him

I want to thank you sir for getting me free of the R A M C up
there I feel rather bad but since my wife is waiting to meet me in
London I was anxious to get through

All right sergeant replied Barry Ill get you to a hospital in
London when we arrive You are not feeling too badly I hope

A little shook up sir said the sergeant

At the R A M C hospital a bitter disappointment awaited him He
found that the V A D had departed for England but just where no one
seemed to know In her last letter to him received before the last tour
in the trenches she had mentioned the possibility of a visit to London
and had promised him further information before her departure but no
further word had he received

His inquiry at Etaples was equally unproductive of result Paula and her
father had also gone to England They had taken the V A D with them
and their address was unknown The matron of the hospital believed that
they had planned a motor trip to Scotland for they had carried Captain
Neil Fraser off with them and were planning a visit to his home They
expected to return in about three weeks

By the bitterness of his disappointment Barry realised how greatly he
had counted on this meeting with his friends Were it not for the hope
of being able to discover them in England he would have turned back
up the line there and then and found among the only friends he had on
this side of the ocean relief from the intolerable weight of loneliness
that was bearing him down

He walked out to the cemetery and stood beside his fathers grave
There for the first time it came over him that henceforth he must go all
the way of his life without the sight of that face without the touch
of that hand on his shoulder without the cheer of that voice In floods
his sense of loss swept his soul It took all his manhood to refrain
from throwing himself prone upon the little mound and yielding to the
agony that flooded his soul and that wrought in his heart physical
pain By a resolute act of will he held himself erect While he blamed
and despised himself for his weakness he was unable to shake it off He
did not know that his mental and emotional state was in large measure
a physical reaction from the prolonged period of exhausting strain
his treble tour in the trenches with its unrelieved sense of impending
destruction that its endless procession of broken torn bodies with
its nights of sleepless activity with its eternal struggle against
depression consequent upon the loss of his comrades its eternal
striving after cheeriness and more than all the shock of the train
wreck with its scenes of horror all this had combined to reduce his
physical powers of resistance to the point of utter exhaustion

As he stood there in that cemetery with its rows of crosses silently
eloquent of heroism and of sacrifice the spirit of the place seemed to
breathe into him new life As his eyes fell upon the cross bearing his
fathers name he seemed to see again that erect and gallant figure
instinct with life and courage There came to him the memory of a scene
he had never forgotten Again he was with his father in the little home
cottage How dear it had been to him then How dear to him today Once
more he felt the strong grip of his fathers hand and heard his fathers
voice

Good night boy We dont know what is before us defeat loss
suffering that part is not in our hands altogether but the shame of
the quitter never need and never shall be ours

Unconsciously as if he were in the presence of a superior officer he
lifted his hand in salute and with a sense of renewal of his vital
energies he returned to the boat

During the crossing his mind was chiefly occupied with the problem of
discovering the whereabouts of the V A D or his American friends
He had never learned her London address if indeed she had one He
remembered that she had told him that her home had been turned into a
hospital He had some slight hope that he might be able to trace her by
the aid of her uncle

Arrived in London his first duty was to see Sergeant Matthews whose
injuries in the wreck were apparently more serious than at first
supposed safely disposed in a hospital ambulance Thereupon he
proceeded to the Hotel Cecil and set himself seriously to the solution
of his problem He was too weary for clear thinking and as the result of
long confused and very vexing cogitation he resolved upon a letter to
Commander Howard Vincent R N R This after much labour he succeeded
in accomplishing Thereafter much too weary for food he proceeded to
his room where he gave himself up to the unimaginable luxury of a bath
in a clean tub and with an unstinted supply of clean towels after
which riotous indulgence he betook himself to bed As he lay stretched
between the smooth clean sheets he found it impossible to recall a
state of existence when clean sheets had been a nightly experience The
chief regret of these semiunconscious moments preceding slumber was
that sleep would rob him of this delicious sense of physical cleanness
and wellbeing

He was wakened by a knock at his door followed by a hesitating apology
for intrusion Rejoicing in the luxury of his surroundings and in the
altogether satisfying discovery that he might sleep again he turned
over and once more was lost in profound slumber A second time he was
aroused by a mild but somewhat anxious inquiry as to his welfare

I want nothing only a little more sleep and again luxuriating for
a few moments in his clean sheets and his peaceful environment he
resigned himself to sleep to waken with a comfortable sense of pleasant
weariness which gradually passed into a somewhat acute sense of hunger

He decided after due consideration that he would plumb the depths of
bliss unmeasured and unknown and have breakfast in bed He went to the
window and looked out upon the murky light of a London day He decided
that it was still early morning and rang for the waiter He was
informed by that functionary that breakfast was impossible but that if
he desired he could be supplied with an early dinner

Dinner exclaimed Barry

He looked at his watch but found that he had neglected to wind it and
that consequently it had stopped

What time do you make it waiter

Half after six sir

He decided that he would rise for dinner phoned for a paper and his
mail and lay back between the sheets once more striving to recapture
that rapturous sense of welfare that had enwrapped him the night before
Luxuriating in this delightsome exercise he glanced lazily at the
heading of his paper and then cried as the paper boy was leaving the
room

Hello here boy what day is this

Friday sir said the boy gazing at him in astonishment

Friday Are you sure

Yes sir Friday sir What does the paper say sir

Oh yes of course All right

He had gone to bed on Wednesday night He knew that because he
remembered the date of his letter to Commander Howard Vincent R N
R He made the astounding discovery that he had slept just fortyfour
hours Then he made a second discovery and that was that of his precious
eight days leave three were already gone

After he had dined he inquired at the desk for his mail and searched
through the telegrams but there was nothing for him

Then he betook himself to the streets aware that the spectre of
loneliness was hard on his trail and swiftly catching up with him
London was roaring around him in the dark like a jungle full of wild
beasts of whose shapes he could catch now and then horrid glimpses
Among all the millions in the city he knew of no living soul to whom he
could go for companionship nor was there anything in form of amusement
that specially invited him

There was Grand Opera of course but from its associations with his
father he knew that that would bring him only acute misery Gladly would
he have gone to the hospitals but they would be shut against him at
this hour He bought an evening paper and under a shaded lamp studied
the amusement columns Some of the Revues he knew to be simply tiresome
others disgusting None of them appealed to him Aimlessly he wandered
along the streets heedless of his direction conscious now and then of
an additional pang of wretchedness as he caught a glimpse now and then
at a theatre door of young officers passing in with sweet faced girls on
their arms

At length in desperation he followed one such pair and found himself
listening to Cinderella Its light and delicate fancy its sweet pathos
its gentle humour lured him temporarily from his misery but often there
came back upon him the bitter memory of his comrades in their horrid
environment of filth danger and wretchedness

He found some compensation in the thought that these officers beside him
were like himself on leave and while he envied them he did not grudge
them their delight in the play and their obviously greater delight in
their lovely companions beside them but this again was neutralised by
the bitter recollection of his own hard fate which denied him a like
joy

After the play he stood in the entrance hall observing the crowd
indulging his sense of illusage at the hands of fate as he saw the
officers lingering with many unnecessary touches over the cloaking of
their fair partners and as he caught the answering glances and smiles
that rewarded their attentions

His eyes followed the manoeuvrings of the painted ladies as they hovered
about the doors boldly busy with their profession He understood as
never before the nature of their lure and the overpowering subtlety of
the temptation cast by them over the lonely soldier in London

Close at his side he heard a voice

How do you like it boy Not bad eh

Awfully jolly dad Its perfectly fine of you

He turned and saw a greyhaired gentleman with upright soldierly
figure and walking with him arm in arm a young officer evidently his
son He followed them slowly to the door and eager to share if he might
the joy of their comradeship he listened to their talk Then as they
disappeared into the darkness sick at heart he passed out of the door
stood a moment to get his bearings and sauntered beyond the radius of
the subdued light about the entrance into the darkness further on

He had gone but a few paces and was standing beneath a shaded corner
light meditating the crossing of the roaring street when he heard
behind him an eager voice crying

Captain Dunbar Captain Dunbar

Swiftly he turned and saw in the dim light a dainty figure opera coat
flowing away from gleaming arms and shoulders a face with its halo of
gold brown hair with soft brown eyes ashine and eager parted lips a
vision of fluttering bewildering loveliness bearing down upon him with
outstretched hands

What he gasped you Oh you darling

He reached for her gathered her in his arms drew her toward him and
before either he or she was aware of what he intended to do kissed her
parting lips

Oh how dare you she cried aghast pushing him back from her her
face in a red flame Oh Im so glad I was afraid I should lose you

Barry appalled at his own temerity his eyes taking in the sweet beauty
of her lovely face stood silent trembling

Well arent you going to tell me you are glad to see me she cried
smiling up at him saucily

Phyllis he murmured moving toward her

Stop she said putting her hands out before her as if to hold him
off Remember where you are I ought to be very angry indeed

She drew him toward a dark wall

But you arent angry Phyllis If you only knew how I have wanted you
in this awful place Oh I have wanted you

She saw that he was white and still trembling

Have you Barry she asked gently Oh you poor boy I know you have
been through horrible things No Barry dont You awful man for his
hands were moving toward her again You must remember where you are
Look at all these people staring at us

People he said as if in a daze What difference do they make Oh
Phyllis you are so wonderfully lovely I cant believe its you but
it is it is I know your eyes Are you glad to see me he asked shyly
his hungry eyes upon her face

Oh Barry she whispered the warm flush rising again in her cheeks
cant you see Cant you see But what am I thinking about Come and
see mamma and theres another dear friend and admirer of yours with
her

Who Not Paula

No not Paula she said with a subtle change in her voice Come and
see

She took his arm and brought him back to a motor standing at the theatre
entrance

Oh mamma I have had such a race she cried excitedly and I have
captured him Barry my mother

Barry took the offered hand and gazed earnestly into the sad brown eyes
that searched his in return

And heres your friend said Phyllis

Hello Pilot said a voice from a dark corner of the car

What Neil Oh you boy he cried in an ecstasy pushing both hands at
him You dear old boy How is the arm eh all right

Oh doing awfully well said Captain Neil And you

Oh never so well in all my life cried Barry Yet to think of it
ten minutes ago or when was it I was in there a miserably homesick
creature envious of all the happy people about me and now

While he was speaking his eyes were on Mrs Vincents face but his
hand was holding fast to her daughters arm Now its a lovely old
town and full of dear people

Where are you putting up asked Mrs Vincent

The Cecil

Let us drive you there then she said

During the drive Barry sat silent for the most part listening to
Phyllis talking excitedly and eagerly beside him answering at random
the questions which came like rapid fire from them all but planning
meanwhile how he should prolong these moments of bliss

How about supper he cried as they arrived in the courtyard of the
hotel Come in I want you to you see I have so much to ask and so
much to tell Captain Fraser here and three of my days are gone already
Besides I want you to awfully

Mrs Vincent looked at his face which for all its brightness was worn
and deeplined and her compassionate motherly heart was stirred

Of course well come We want to see you and to hear about your
experiences

Oh bully cried Barry I shall always remember how good you are to
me tonight

He was overflowing with excitement

Oh this is great Neil Its like having a bit of the old battalion
here to see you again

While waiting for their orders to be filled at the supper table Captain
Neil turned suddenly to Barry and said Whats all this about a train
wreck and the gallant O C train

Yes and this rescuing of men from burning cars exclaimed Phyllis

And knocking out insubordinates

And being mentioned in despatches

And receiving cheers at the station

Now where did you get all that stuff inquired Barry

Why all London is ringing with it said Captain Neil

Nonsense said Barry whos been stuffing you

Well said Phyllis we came across your sergeant today in the
hospital Such a funny man

Who Fatty Matthews asked Barry turning to Captain Neil

Yes it was Fatty said Captain Neil and if you had your rights by
his account you ought to be in command at this moment of an army corps
at the very least But you were O C leave train were you not

Yes to my dismay I was made O C but I met a chap Captain Courtney
a very decent fellow my adjutant and made him carry on

My word that was a stroke

We had a wreck a ghastly affair it was though it might have been a
lot worse The R A M C people did magnificently and the men behaved
awfully well so that we managed to get through

And what about the O C inquired Captain Neil

Oh nothing special He just saw that the others carried on Now tell
me about you people What have you been doing and what are you going to
do

Well were here because were here chanted Captain Neil

And why didnt you send me word as to your movements said Barry
What hours of agony you would have spared me

But I did replied Phyllis I sent you our town address and told you
everything

Now isnt that rotten exclaimed Barry Never mind Ive found you
and now whats the programme

Well cried Captain Neil with great enthusiasm we are all off to
Edinburgh tomorrow where we meet the Howlands and then for a motor
trip through the Highlands and to my ancestral home

Barrys face fell Tomorrow he said blankly with a quick look at
Phyllis And you are all going

Not I said Mrs Vincent but why should you not join the party You
need just such a change It would do you good

Sure thing he will cried Captain Neil

During the supper they had firmly resolved to taboo the war They talked
on all manner of subjects chiefly of the proposed motor trip but in
spite of the ban their talk would hark back to the trenches For Captain
Neil must know how his comrades were faring and how his company was
carrying on and Barry must tell him of their losses and all of the
great achievements wrought by the men of their battalion And Barry
because his own heart was full of all their splendid deeds let himself
go He told how Sally and Booth had met their last call of the M O
and his splendid work in rescuing the wounded

No word in all of this of the Pilot I observe interjected Captain
Neil

Oh he just carried on

Then he told how at last the M O went out and how on his face there
was only peace He had to tell of Corporal Thom and how he gave himself
for his comrades and how Cameron kept the faith a long list of heroes
he had to enumerate of whom the world was not worthy whose deeds are
unknown to fame but whose names are recorded in the books of God And
then reverently he told of McCuaig

As Barry talked his heart was far away from London He was seeing
again that line of mud bespattered men patiently plodding up the
communication trench He was looking upon them sleeping with worn and
weary faces in rain and mudsoaked boots and puttees down in their
flimsy dark dugouts He was hearing again the heavy crash of the
trench mortar the earth shaking crumph of the high explosive the
swift rush of the whizbang Before his eyes he saw a steady line of
bayonets behind a crumbling wall then a quick rush to meet the attack
bomb and rifle in hand He saw the illumined face of his dying friend

As he told his tale his face was glowing his eyes gleaming as with an
inner fire

Oh Gods Mercy he cried they are men They are men Only God could
make such men

Yes only God echoed Mrs Vincent after a long pause They are Gods
men and to God they go at last Truly they are Gods own men

While Barry was speaking Phyllis her hands tightly clasped was
leaning forward listening with glistening eyes and parted lips Suddenly
she rose and went hurriedly to the door

Forgive me said Barry turning to Mrs Vincent I should not have
talked about these things Its Neil here that drew me out Its his
fault

In a few minutes Captain Neil arose and saying Ill see where Phyllis
has gone went out at the same door

They are very great friends said Mrs Vincent We are very fond of
Captain Fraser Indeed he is like one of our family

A fine brave chap he is said Barry warmly but with a queer chill at
his heart

Phyllis has made some very delightful friends in France Those
Americans at Etaples were very good to her and she continued to chat
in her soft gentle voice to which Barry gave a courteous hearing
but very casual replies His heart and his ears were attentive for the
returning footsteps of those who had so abruptly deserted them While
Mrs Vincent was talking an ugly question was thrusting itself upon his
attention demanding an answer He could seeany one with eyes could
seethat there was between Phyllis and his friend Captain Neil some
understanding Just what was between them Barry longed to know It
flashed upon him that upon the answer to that question his whole future
hung for if this girl was more than friend to Captain Neil then the
joy of life had for him been quenched No motor trip for him tomorrow
He had had enough heartwrenching to bear as it was without that No
If between these two a closer relation than that of mere friendship
existed his way was clear He would return to the trenches tomorrow

Oh here you are dear said Mrs Vincent as Phyllis and Captain Neil
returned to the room You found the air too close I fear

No said Phyllis with simple sincerity it was Barry I saw those
men and I could not bear it I cant bear it now Her lips were still
trembling and her eyes were filled with tears

And yet said Barry when you were over there in the midst of it all
you never once weakened Thats the wonder of it You just go on doing
what you must do You havent time to reflect and its Gods mercy that
it is so Thank God we have our duty to do no matter what comes Without
that life would be unbearable

Now what about tomorrow said Captain Neil briskly as Mrs Vincent
rose from the table We must settle that What about it Barry

I dont know Do you think I should go Its your party and its
already made up

Not quite said Phyllis looking shyly at him You belong to the
party more than any of us you know

Then what about Paula said Barry This is her party is it not

Phyllis was silent

I think Captain Dunbar said Mrs Vincent if you would like it
you ought to go You need something of the kind and you will fit in
admirably with the party I am quite sure Today she added with a
little laugh I was doubtful as to the propriety of these young people
going off all the way to Edinburgh by themselves but you know in these
war times we do extraordinary things but now if you join them my
scruples will be removed

Some chaperon whispered Captain Neil audibly to Phyllis Then he
added briskly Well then thats settled Tomorrow at 837 we meet at
Kings Cross 837 remember

But for Barry the matter was far from settled

I cant quite make up my mind tonight he said I shall be at Kings
Cross however in the morning at any rate

But Barry began Phyllis protesting you mustI want

She ceased speaking abruptly her face flushing and then going suddenly
white

Oh rot old man said Captain Neil impatiently you will come Of
course hell come he added to Phyllis

They moved together out of the room Mrs Vincent and Captain Neil
leading the way

Oh Barry arent you going said Phyllis in a low voice

How can I answer that he replied almost in anger Do YOU ask me to
go Do YOU want me to go

Of course we all want you to go said the girl

Is that your answer His voice was tense his face strained If that
is all Phyllis I must say Goodbye tonight Why should I go with
you Why should I stay here in London Theres nothing for me here The
war is the only place

Oh Barry she said her eyes bright with tears how unkindly how
terribly you talk Then with a swift change of mood she turned upon
him What right have you to talk like that she cried in sudden wrath
What have I donewhat have we done to you

Wait Phyllis he cried desperately Oh let them go on he added
impatiently For Heavens sake is there no place about here where I
can talk to you They were both pale and trembling I must talk to you
tonightnowat once He stood between her and the door Cant
you see I love you I love you do you hear If you dont love me why
should I live

Oh Barry said the girl in a hurried voice You must not talk like
this Come this way I know this place She hurried out by a side door
down a corridor and into a small parlour with cosy corners where they
were alone

Now Phyllis said Barry facing her with a settled fierceness in
his voice and manner I am quite mad I know to love you but I do I
cant help it any more than breathing I have no right to tell you this
perhaps I am nobody and I have nothing to offer any girl I see that
now Oh I see that clearly now but I never thought of that part of
it before I only loved you How could I help it I hardly knew myself
until tonight But I know now he added in a voice of triumph the
gloom lifting from his face and the fierce light fading from his eyes
Yes I know now Phyllis I love you I shall always love you I love
you and I am glad to love you Nothing can take that from me

All this time she was standing before him her face white her lips
parted a look of wonder almost of fear in the brown eyes so bravely
holding his her hands pressed hard upon her bosom as if to stay its
tumult

I have no right to say this to you said Barry again You belong to a
great family Perhaps you are rich Great Heavens he groaned I never
thought of that You are beautiful Many men will love you great men
and rich men will love you You are so wonderful Why theres Captain
Neil he

Captain Neil echoed Phyllis with infinite scorn in her voice

Well many men

Many men she repeated her lips beginning to tremble Oh Barry
cant you see You blind boy Theres only one man for me Barry and
thats you just you She came near to him laid her hands upon his
breast her eyes looking into his

Phyllis he said putting his arms round her a great wonder in his
voice It cant be true Oh it cant be true Yet your eyes your dear
eyes say so Phyllis I do believe you love me

The little hands slid up around his neck he drew her close

Phyllis my dear dear love he whispered

He felt her body suddenly relax and as she leaned backwards in his
arms still clinging to him he bent over her and his lips met hers in a
long kiss



CHAPTER XVIII

A WEDDING JOURNEY


Just a moment if you please Paula I should like to get down a
few notes of this bit Oh what a view Lake moor hills mountains
village

Mr Howland sprang from the car sketchbook in hand and ran forward
to a jutting rock that commanded the wide valley flanked by hills in
whose bosom lay a loch shimmering in the morning light The car drew
up on the brow of a long and gently sloping incline which the road
followed until it disappeared in a turn at the village at the lochs
end

Get the little church tower in father and a bit of the castle I can
see it from here said Paula standing upon the motor seat

I shall try this further rock said her father Ah here it is Do
come all of you and get this Oh what a perfectly glorious view

The little group gathered about him in silence upon a little headland
that overlooked the valley and feasted upon the beauty that spread
itself out before them the undulating slope and shimmering loch the
wide moors and softly rounded hills the dark green masses of ragged
firs and the great white Bens in the far distance and below them
in the midst the human touch in a nestling village with its
Heavenpointing spire

Hark said Paula

From across the loch there floated up to them soft and mellow as an
angels song the sound of a bell

Mr Rowland dropped his sketchbook took off his hat and stood as if in
worship The other men followed his example

Father said Paula lets go to church

Hush said her father putting up his hand and so stood for some
moments

Oh Scotland Scotland he cried lifting his arms high above his
head no wonder your children in exile weep for their native land

And your men fight and die for you added Paula glancing at Captain
Neil

Thank you said Captain Neil turning quickly away

Yes said Paula we shall go to church here father

The church stood against a cluster of ancient firs in the midst of
its quiet graves yew shaded here and there Beside it stood the manse
within its sweet old garden protected by a moss covered stone wall

At its gate the minister stood a dark man with silvering hair of some
sixty years but still erect and with a noble intellectual face

Let us speak to him said Paula as they left their car

With characteristic reserve Barry and Neil shrank from greeting a
stranger but with fine and easy courtesy Mr Howland bared his head
and went up to the minister

We heard your bells invitation sir he said and we came to worship
with you

A grave smile touched the dark face

You rightly interpreted its message he said Let me repeat its
welcome

We are Americans at least my daughter and I are said Mr Howland
presenting Paula a frank smile upon her beautiful face and this is
her young friend from London Miss Vincent and these young officers are
of the Canadian army

Canadians exclaimed the minister meeting them with both hands Oh
you are indeed welcome

We are all in the war sir I would have you know added Mr Howland

The minister looked puzzled

Let me explain said Barry Mr Rowland and his daughter are on leave
from their own hospital which they have set up in France Miss Vincent
is from the base hospital in Boulogne

Like the sun breaking upon the loch in a dull day a smile broke over
the dark face He threw the gate wide open

In the name of my country in this its dark hour let me give you
welcome and once more he shook them each by the hand We have still
half an hour before worship he continued Pray do me the honour of
entering my manse

They followed him up the shrubberyflanked gravel walk to the door

Enter he said going before them into the manse Jean Jean he
called

Yes dear came a voice like the sound of a silver bell and from
another room issued a lady with a face of rare and delicate loveliness
Her soft clinging black gown with a touch of white at her throat
served to emphasise the sweet purity of her face but cast over it a
shade of sadness at once poignant and tender

My dear this is Mrs Robertson he said simply these friends
Americans and Canadians are from the war

At that word she came to greet them her face illumined by a smile
inexpressibly sweet but inexpressibly sad You are welcome oh very
welcome she said in a soft Scotch voice Come in and rest for a few
moments

Our young friend here Captain Dunbar is chaplain of a distinguished
Canadian regiment

They are all distinguished said the lady

A chaplain said the minister My dear sir we should be grateful for
a message for our people from the front

Oh yes if you would added his wife

But protested Barry I want to hear some one else preach One
gets very tired of ones own preaching and besides Im a very poor
preacher

Ill take that risk but I will not press you said the minister
courteously

Do Barry said Paula in a low voice but he shook his head

I see you have some soldier friends at the front said Mr Rowland
pointing to a photograph on the mantel of a young officer in Highland
dress

Our son sir said the minister quietly

Our only son added his wife quietly He was in the Black Watch
Her voice with its peculiar belllike quality was full of pride and
tenderness

Oh said Phyllis turning to her with quick tears in her eyes and
holding out her hand

Ah said the lady you too Your brother

My two brothers

My dear child My dear child said the ministers wife kissing her
Your mother was greatly privileged she added gently

It was a deeply moving scene

Madam said Mr Howland wiping his eyes forgive me but you mothers
are the wonder of the war

There are many of us in this glen sir she replied We cannot give
our lives sir We can only give what is dearer than our lives our
dear dear sons and believe me we dont grudge them

Madam said Mr Howland the whole world honours you and wonders at
you

Sir said Barry obeying a quick impulse I cannot preach but may I
tell your people something about their boys and how splendid they are

Thank you said the minister

Oh would you cried his wife There are many there who feel only the
loss and the sorrow You can tell them something of its splendour

By this time in the eyes of all the visitors there were tears but on
the faces of the minister and his wife there was only the serene peace
of those who within the sacred shrine of sacrifice have got a vision of
its eternal glory

Barry said Paula drawing him aside I love you for this but do
talk about something or I shall surely cry These people break my
heart

Oh no said Barry looking at them there are no tears there They
have been all the way through

Like people like priest The folk that gathered in the little church
that morning were simple people of the glen shepherds and cotters from
the countryside humble villagers They were women for the most part
with old men and children The girls were away at the munition plants
the young men at the war fighting or lying under their little crosses
or in their unknown and unmarked graves on one of Britains five battle
fronts or under the tossing waters of the Seven Seas where Britains
navy rides guarding the worlds freedom Simple peasant folk they were
but with that look of grave and thoughtful steadfastness with which
Scotland knows how to stamp her people

The devotions were conducted by the minister with simple sincerity
and with a prophets mystic touch and a prophets vision of things
invisible

Barry made no attempt at a sermon He yielded himself to the spirit
of the place the spirit of the manse and its people whose serene
fortitude under the burden of their sorrow had stirred him to his souls
depths Their spirit recalled the spirit of his own father and the
spirit of the men he had known in the trenches He made a slight
reference to the horrors of the war He touched lightly upon the
soldiers trials but he told them tales of their endurance their
patience their tenderness to the wounded their comradeship their
readiness to sacrifice Before he closed he lifted them up to see the
worth and splendour of it all and gave them a vision of the worlds
regeneration through the eternal mystery of the cross

They listened with uplifted face on which rested a quiet wonder
touched with that light that only falls where sacrifice and sacrament
are joined There were tears on many faces but they fell quietly
without bitterness without passion without despair

A woman with a grief worn face waited for him at the foot of the pulpit
stairs the ministers wife and Phyllis beside her

Mrs Finlayson wishes to speak to you she said

Ay ay I jist want to say that you had the word for me the day I
see it better the noo Am mair content that ma mon sud be sleepin oot
yonder She held Barrys hand while she spoke her tears falling on it
then kissed it and turned away

And this said the ministers wife is Mrs Murray who has given
three sons and who has just sent her last son away this week

Three sons echoed Barry gazing at the strong face beaten and brown
with the winds and suns of fifty years and you sent away your last
Oh I wonder at you How could you

A cudna haud him back wi his three brithers lyin oot there and she
added with a proud lift of her head and wudna

It took some minutes for Barry to make his way through to the door He
wanted to greet them all He had a feeling that he was there not in his
own person but as a representative standing between two noble companies
of martyrs those who had gone forth to die and those who had sent
them

You have done us a great service today sir said the minister in
bidding Barry goodbye

It was a privilege to do it said Barry as he shook hands with the
minister and his wife I shall tell the men about you and your people

My dear my dear is he your man asked the ministers wife as she
held Phyllis hand

He is said Phyllis glancing at Barry with shy pride

And he leaves you soon

In two days replied the girl with a quick breath

Dont let him away till you give yourself wholly to him Why not
tomorrow Its a mothers word

Thats what I say cried Paula impulsively seeking to cover the
girls blushing confusion Neil she added turning to him I should
love to be married in just such a dear little church as this

All right said Neil I know another just like it and I shall show
it to you next week

They wandered down by the lochs side Passing a boatrenting
establishment Paula suddenly exclaimed

My Land of Liberty look there Barry

What

A canoe she cried running toward it A Canadian canoe

A genuine Peterboro he cried following her Where did you get
this he inquired turning to the boatman

My boy brought it with him from Canada sir He is an engineer I have
his whole outfit in the housetent camp things and all He is at the
war himself

Oh Barry look at the dear thing What does it make you think of She
glanced at Barrys face and added quickly Oh I know Forgive me Im
a fool

Come along Phyllis said Barry drawing her away with him I want to
talk to you

We shall take lunch in half an hour Barry called Mr Howland after
him Were due at Pitlochry you know for dinner

All right sir said Barry Well be on hand

I wonder if shes got the nerve said Paula to Captain Neil as they
stood looking after them

I wonder said Captain Neil looking at her Would you

Would I said Paula with sudden shyness Ibut you are not going
away in two days

No thank the good Lord said Captain Neil fervently but Paula
Ill not forget

At Pitlochry they found their mail awaiting them

A telegram for you Barry said Paula who had assumed the duty of
postman

They all paused in examining their mail to watch Barry open his wire

Guess he shouted holding his telegram high

Oh glory I know exclaimed Paula Extended leave How much

Oh excellent young maid how much elder art thou than thy looks

Oh Barry exclaimed Phyllis How much

Five days five whole days

Humph Its the least they could do They might have made it ten
grumbled Paula

Mr Howland may I speak to you a moment Barrys look and voice were
eloquent of resolve

Certainly Barry Immediately

If you please sir

They retired to a corner where Barry could be seen with ardent look
and vehement gesture putting his proposition to Mr Howland whose face
showed mingled pleasure and perplexity The others waited patiently for
the conference to end

Oh pshaw said Paula Barry ought to know by this time that the
pater simply cant make up his mind without me I know what they are
at

She moved over to them

Now father of course you will do as Barry wishes she declared
Oh I know what he wants Now listen to me Just wire Mrs Vincent that
everything is perfectly all right that you can guarantee Barry
and that its the sensible thing the only thing to do under the
circumstances Oh well have it in that dear little church Splendid
Perfectly ripping Eh Phyllis Come over here at once Now father get
busy on the wire Why waste a perfectly good hour in just talking about
it What do you say folks How many say Ay

Up went Barrys two hands and with them Neils and Paulas

What about you miss asked Paula turning wrathfully toward Phyllis

Phyllis walked quietly to Barrys side

Barry she said giving him her hand I have decided to be married
tomorrow I shall wire mamma

Barry answered her only with his eyes

By Jove said Paula you Britishers are the limit for stolid
unemotional people Here am I shouting my head off like a baseball fan
to get this thing put through and you quietly walk up and announce that
everythings fixed but the band

The wires to London that afternoon were kept busy a message going to
Mrs Vincent from each member of the party but it was felt that that
from Phyllis to her mother was really all that was necessary


Dearest MammaBarry and I are to be married tomorrow English law
makes London impossible as Barry has only five days I am very happy
feeling sure you approve Our dearest dearest love

Phyllis


A long wire also went from Barry to Mr Robertson the minister of the
little church where they had spent such a delightful hour that morning
but this wire Barry showed to no one

The brides bouquet was from the manse garden a shower of white roses
no purer and no sweeter than the bride herself At the church door the
party stood shrinking from the moment of parting At length Paula took
matters in hand

As usual she said the heavy work falls to me Dear Mrs
Robertsonto the ministers wifegoodbye I shall always love you
and your dear little church

She put her arms around the ministers wife and kissed her

Oh were going to see them off said that lady Lead the way
Captain Dunbar please she added with a bright smile giving him a
little push

Come Phyllis said Barry offering his wife his arm and they started
off down the street toward the lake

Will you permit me said the minister offering his arm to Paula who
in mystified silence took it without a word

May I have the pleasure said Mr Howland offering his arm to Mrs
Robertson

Come Captain Fraser she said gaily offering him the other arm

Just what is happening to me I dont pretend to know said Paula
but whatever it is America is in this thing to the finish

Barry stopped at the boathouse landing There tied to the dock floated
the Canadian canoe laden with tent and camp outfit and with extra
baskets provided from the manse

Oh Barry how wonderful How perfectly wonderful cried Paula in an
ecstasy of delight

In that farewell there were tears and smiles but more smiles than
tears The last to touch their hands was Paula She managed to draw them
apart from the others with her eyes glistening with unaccustomed tears
You deserve each other Phyllis she whispered alternately shaking
and kissing her there was a day when I would have fought you for him
until Neil came Barry you dear boy you may kiss me goodbye and oh
may you both live forever

Goodbye dear Paula cried Phyllis You have been so lovely to me
from the very first I shall never never forget you

Goodbye Paula said Barry dearest of all dear friends

She stooped to steady the canoe while Phyllis stepped to her place in
the bow

Goodbye to all of you God love you and keep you all said Barry

He took his paddle and stepped into the canoe Paula still stooping over
it to keep it steady

Dear dear Barry she whispered and for the first time her tears
fell Goodbye Goodbye

Together the little company stood watching them away Phyllis in the
bow not paddling sat with her face toward them Barry swinging his
paddle with graceful powerful strokes until just at a curve of the
shore where some birches overhung the water he swung the canoe half
round and with paddle held Voyageur fashion in salute they passed out
of sight



CHAPTER XIX

THE PILOTS LAST PORT


The little Canadian army was done with The Salient The British
tradition established in the third month of the war in that first
terrific twentytwo days fight by Ypres that that deadly convex should
be no thoroughfare to Calais for the Hun was passed on with The Salient
into Canadian hands in the early months of 1915 How the little Canadian
army preserved the tradition and barred the roadhog of Europe from
the channel coast for seventeen months let history tell and at what
cost let the dead declare who lie in unmarked graves which following
the curving line of trenches from Langemarck through Hooge and Sanctuary
Wood over Observation Ridge to St Eloi and the dead under those little
crosses that crowd the cemeteries of The Salient and of the clearing
stations in the rear and the living as well who through life will
carry the burden of enfeebled and mutilated bodies

For seventeen months the Canadians in shallow dugouts and behind flimsy
trenches endured the maddening pounding of the Huns guns big and
little without the satisfaction of reprisal except in raid or
counterattack suffering the loss of twothirds of their entire force
but still holding Now at length came the welcome release They were
ordered to the Somme Welcome not simply because of escape from an
experience the most trying to which an army could be subjected but
welcome chiefly because there was a chance of fighting back

They had no illusions about that great battle area of the south echoes
of whose titanic struggle had reached them but they longed for a chance
to get back at their foe Besides the Somme challenged their fighting
spirit That glorious assault of the first of July of the allied
armies which flung them upon the scientifically prepared embattled
and entrenched German Frontier with its fortified villages its gun
stuffed woods its massed parks of artillery and defended by highly
disciplined and superbly organised soldiery stirred them like a bugle
call For two years the master warmakers of the world had employed
scientific knowledge ingenuity and unlimited resources upon the
construction of a system of defence by means of which they hoped to defy
the world and upon which when completed they displayed the vaunting
challenge We are ready for you come on

In that great conflict there was no element of surprise It was a
deliberate testing out of strength physical and moral For the first
time in the war the British army stood upon something like even terms
in manpower and in weight of metal with however the immense handicap
still resting upon it that it was the attacking force The result
settled forever the question of the fighting quality of the races When
the first days fight was done on a battle front of twenty miles the
British armies had smashed a hole seven miles wide while their gallant
allies fighting on an eightmile front had captured the whole line
In two weeks time the sevenmile hole was widened to ten Fortified
villages entrenched redoubts woods stuffed with guns great and small
had gone down before that steady relentless crushing advance The
full significance of the Somme had not dawned as yet upon the world The
magnitude of the achievement was not yet estimated but already names
hitherto unknown were flung up flaming into the worlds sky in letters
of eternal fire Ovillers Mametz Wood Trones Wood Langueval Mouquet
Farm Deville Wood for the British with twentyone thousand prisoners
and Hardecourt Dompierre BecquinCourt Bussu and Fay for the French
allies with thirtyone thousand prisoners

On that line of carefully chosen and elaborately fortified defences the
proudest of Germanys supermen of war had been beaten at their own game
by the civilian soldiers of effete and luxury loving Britain and the
republican armies of decadent France and still the Homeric fight was
raging Foot by foot yard by yard the Hun was fighting to hold the
line which should make good his insolent claim to the hegemony of the
world Step by step yard by yard that line was being torn from his
bloody fingers Into that sea of fire and blood the Canadians were to
plunge They remembered Langemarck and Sanctuary Wood and St Eloi and
were not unwilling to make the plunge They thought of those long
months in The Salient when the ruthless Hun from his vantage ground of
overwhelming superiority had poured his deadly hail from right flank
left flank front and rear upon them holding suffering dying day by
day month by month and they were grimly jubilant over the chance which
the Somme offered them of evening somewhat the score

We have something to hand Fritzie young Pickles was heard to remark
when he had learned of the quality of the Somme fighting and I hope
hell like it for hes got to take it

The battalion ranks both officers and men had once more been filled
up They had a brief fortnights training in the new open fighting under
barrage and then set off cheerfully for the Big Game Ten days they
marched and countermarched in the back country keeping clear of those
two mighty streams up and down that flowed between ditches and
hedges along the road that led to the great arena and catching glimpses
and echoes as they marched until hard fit keen they joined the
upstream flowing toward Albert That stream was made up of those
various and multifarious elements that go to constitute equip and
maintain a modern army

There were marching battalions with their mounted officers bearing
names and insignia famous in the worlds wars for two hundred years and
with them battalions who a few brief months ago were peaceful citizens
knowing nothing of war There were transport columns ammunition
columns artillery columns with mounted escorts There were big guns
on huge caterpillar trucks shouldering the lighter traffic to the
ditches and little guns slipping meekly in their rear There were motor
lorries honking and thundering their insistent way through dodging
escaping cursing infantry fortysix miles of them to a single army
corps There were strings of mules and horses with weirdly shaped
burdens on their pack saddles There were motor cars bearing Brass
Hats gentle looking individuals excessively polite yet somehow
getting men to jump when they spoke and everywhere ambulances silent
and swift moving before whose approach the stream parted in recognition
of the right of way of these messengers of mercy over all the enginery
of war

The down stream was much the same with here and there differences
That stream flowed more swiftly The battalions marched with more
buoyant tread They had done their part and without shame They had met
their foes and seen their backs The trucks transport and ammunition
wagons were empty and coming with a rush Only the ambulances moved more
slowly Carefully with watchful avoidance of ruts and holes which
in spite of the army of roadmending Huns broke up the surface of the
pavements these ambulances made their way They must get through no
matter what was held up

And as they flowed these streams ever and anon broke their banks and
flooded over in little eddies into villages and fields there to tarry
for a day and a night only to be caught up again in either one of those
resistless inevitable currents of war

Look before you major said Barry who was riding with the
Headquarters Company at the head of the column as often now at the
invitation of the O C

The column was slowly climbing a long gentle sloping hill that reached
its apex some two or three miles away On either side spread out over
the fields as far as the eye could reach were military encampments in
tents in huts and in the open Infantry units horse lines motor
truck parks repair camps for motors and for guns ammunition dumps
with shells piled high supply sheds bulging with their canvascovered
contents Red Cross huts and marquees and Y M C A tents with their
cues of waiting soldiers getting eats and drinks and comforts of
various kinds The whole countryside was one mighty encampment packed
with munitions and supplies and thronging with horses mules and men

This is war on the grand scale said the O C dropping back beside
them From the top of this hill we can see Albert and a part of the
most famous battlefield of all time We camp just outside of Albert
on what is known as the brick field and in a couple of days more
we shall be in it Well he continued with a glance over the column
following the boys never were more fit

And never more keen said the major They are right on their toes

Major I expect to meet the divisional commander down here and I want
you to be there Captain Dunbar you know him I believe He has asked
especially that you should be there as well

Yes sir I have met the General To my mind he is an ideal soldier

Yes and an ideal officer said the O C He knows his job and he is
always fit and keen

At the top of the hill a traffic officer a young lieutenant from the
Imperial forces diverted the column from the road into a field

Why is this inquired the O C

Theres the answer sir said the officer coolly

There was a long drawn whine which rapidly grew into a shriek and an H
E shell dropped fair in the road a short distance in front

Oh I see you have some of these birds down in this country too

Yes sir this is their breeding ground said the young lieutenant

Once more came the long whining shriek and the terrific blast of the H
E this time closer

I would not delay sir if I were you said the young chap coolly
pulling out his cigarette case They get rather ugly at times

What about you inquired the O C moving off

Part of my job sir replied the youth saluting

Well good luck boy said the O C trotting to the head of the
column

Thank you sir said the youth turning to his job again

They rode a hundred yards when another shell came there was a terrific
explosion apparently just at the spot where the young officer had been
standing

By Jove Im afraid thats got him said the O C

Ill go and see sir said Barry spurring his horse back to the spot

Come back here Barry called the major Darn him for a fool Whats
the use of that That isnt his job he added angrily

He thinks it is probably said the O C

Barry found a great hole in the road with the officers horse lying
disembowelled beside it kicking in his death agony There was no sign
of his rider anywhere Fortunately there was a gap in the column so
that no one else was near enough to be injured

As Barry stood gazing about a voice hailed him from the ditch which
was several feet deep

I say sir said the voice I wouldnt just stay there They
generally send over four of em Thats only the third I find this
ditch very convenient though somewhat mucky

Barry looked at him in astonishment He was white and shaken covered
with mud but trying to get his cigarette case open

Id get off sir if I were you he said until the next one comes
Quick sir I hear it now

Barry needed no second invitation He flung himself headlong into the
ditch beside the young fellow but the shell dropped into the field
beyond

Thats as near as I like em said the young officer scraping the
mud off his clothes My poor old geegee got it though He drew his
revolver and shot the wounded animal Its hard on the horses You see
they cant dodge he added

I say my boy said Barry for the lieutenant was only a boy that
was a near thing for you What are you going to do now

Oh just carry on said the boy The relief will be along in a few
hours Beastly mess eh he continued but whether he referred to the
disembowelled horse or the state of his own uniform Barry could not
say

You are sure you are all right said Barry as he shook hands with
him Im awfully glad you werent hurt

So am I said the boy heartily Awfully rotten to be potted out here
playing a bally policeman eh What Well good luck sir and Barry
rode off to join his column with a deep admiration in his heart for the
English school boy who when war began was probably a fifth form lad
in whose life the most dangerous episode would be a ball taken full off
bat at point or a low tackle on the Rugby field

At Divisional Headquarters they met the general who after a
conversation with the O C greeted Barry warmly

So you have gone and done it young man Well I admire your nerve and
I congratulate you I happen to know the family very well As a matter
of fact there is some remote connection I believe By the way I have a
communication from London for you he added drawing Barry to one side
and giving him a little slip I happen to know about it he continued
while Barry was reading his telegram and say if I can be of any
assistance I shall be very glad Its a step up you see I have no
doubt it can be put through quite easily and quickly and I believe the
step is coming to you

Barry stood with his eyes upon the dispatch It was an offer of a
hospital appointment at the base and carried with it his majority

I have no doubt the missus will be pleased eh said the general with
a grin

Barry pulled out a letter from his pocket opened it and handed it to
the general pointing to a paragraph The general took it and read

And Barry dear remember that though you have a wife now your duty to
your country is still your first duty I would hate that any thought of
me should make it harder for you to carry on

The general folded up the letter put it slowly into its envelope and
handed it back to Barry

I know her he said simply I should expect nothing else from her
You are a lucky dog but of course he added with a swift glance at
Barrys face some one must take that job

I fancy sir there are many for it who are hardly fit for this work
up here replied Barry quietly I think sir Ill just carry on where
I am

You are quite sure inquired the general Dont you want a day or two
to think it over

I am quite sure sir said Barry I am quite sure that my wife would
approve

Very well then said the general let me handle this for you and
let me say sir that I am proud to have you in my division

So saying he gripped Barrys hand hard and turned abruptly away to the
others

They rode to their camp in almost complete silence except for a grunt
or two from the O C who seemed in a grumpy mood

When they arrived at Headquarters the O C drew up his horse and
turning to the major said

I dont know just what to do with this Pilot of ours He is a fool in
some ways

A darned fool sir said the major emphatically

And continued the major I am selfish enough to say that I am damned
gladI wont apologise Pilotthat he decided to stay with us It
would have been just a little harder to carry on if he had left us

Yes growled the major but oh well we have got to stick it I
guess The Pilot is a soldier all right

There was nothing further said about the matter but next day as Barry
walked about the camp among the men their eyes followed him as he
passed and every officer in the mess seemed to discover an errand that
took him to Barrys tent

Two days later the Canadians moved up into the line and took over from
the Australians They followed the Bapaume Road toward Pozieres passing
through a country which had seen the heaviest fighting in the war

This said the O C drawing aside from the road and riding to a
slightly rising ground is La Boiselle or at least where it was and
that I fancy is the famous mine crater Sixty thousand pounds of gun
cotton blew up that hole

There was absolutely no sign of the village the very foundations of the
houses and the cellars having the appearance of a ploughed field

That was a desperate fight continued the O C It was here that
the Middlesex men made their great charge Fifty men reported from the
battalion when it was over In that village they had a whole division
fighting before they were through Middlesex men Royal Scots and Irish
for three days and three nights

As they rode along the guns on either side began their evening
chorus and from the far rear came the roaring rush of the H Es like
invisible express trains hurtling through the air It was music to their
ears and they rode forward with a new feeling in their hearts for
there appeared to be almost no reply from the enemy guns

The battalion took to the trenches at the crossing of the Pozieres Road
and so effective was the counterbattery work that they were able to
settle down into their battle positions without casualties The R A P
was in a deep German dugout thirty feet below the surface with double
entrances and heavily timbered It had been most elaborately prepared
planked on sides and floor and fitted with electric lights There were
two main rooms with a connecting corridor leading to each entrance
They found an Australian medical officer in charge

These chaps were regular settlers werent they said Barry after
they had exchanged greetings

Yes sir they intended to sty apparently said the Australian in
his slow drawl We found some letters on a wounded officer indicating
their intention to remyn for the durytion but we wanted the
plycecouldnt carry on without it in fact Its quite a good plyce
too he added with a cheerful grin

Why its just bully said the M O I am only sorry that we cant
promise you as good in The Salient

I hear it is rather rotten eh sir said the Australian

Not as bad as Gallipoli though said Barry By Jove You Australian
chaps did magnificently down there Must have been a perfect hell

Oh yes quite hot for a while but I fancy you Canydians didnt have
any afternoon tea party in The Sylient eh My word there was some
fighting there Oh there it comes he added

As he spoke a muffled explosion was heard and the dugout rocked and
the candles flickered

Can they get you down here inquired the M O

I fancy a direct hit from a really big H E would disturb our little
home but nothing else would Of course a shell in the door wye would
be a bit awkward you knaow replied the Australian

The night however passed quietly and except for a few slightly
wounded walking cases there was little work to do The Canadians
decided that in coming to the Somme they had made a most happy
exchange

A quiet day followed the night but the whole battalion was keyed up
with intense expectation for the attack which they knew was fixed for
the night following With expectation mingled curiosity They knew all
about raiding that was their own specialty but they were curious as
to the new style of fighting which they knew to be awaiting them the
capturing holding and consolidating of a line of enemy trenches

Nightfall brought the opportunity to gratify their curiosity For two
hours before the attack their guns put down the barrage to cover the
front line of enemy trenches and to dispose of his wire

The M O and Barry with the Australian and their whole staff made
their way to a ridge a few yards distant to see the show

Great Heaven what is that inquired the M O pointing to what
seemed to be a line of flickering watch fires upon the crest of a
neighbouring rising ground

Guns Ours said the Australian surprised at the M Os excitement

Guns My Lord guns Barry shouted the M O

Guns And in the open And on a hill And wheel to wheel cried Barry
Thank the good Lord I have lived to see this day Look at the boys he
added in a low tone to the Australian beside him

They glanced over their shoulders and saw two of the orderlies executing
a foxtrot in the heavy shellploughed soil

Whats the row inquired the Australian

Why my dear chap replied the M O dont you know we have never
seen a gun in action in the open that way Our guns operated only from
holes and corners from hedges and cellars Otherwise theyd be spotted
and knocked out in an hour

Ow said the Australian our bird men attended to that the first dye
of the fight They sye there was a double line of observation balloons
along the lines ours and theirs up to the 30th of June The next
morning not a Boche balloon was to be seen Our plynes put their eye out
in a single afternoon Since that time we hold over them in the air
Ah There are the heavies coming up now The full chorus will be on in
half a minute

A few seconds later the truth of the Australians prophecy was
demonstrated The full chorus was on For two hours the barrage raged
and the din was such that they had to shout in each others ears to be
heard The hilltops were ringed with darting tongues of red flame as
though belched out by a thousand fabled dragons It was as if the air
above was filled with millions of invisible demons whining moaning
barking shrieking in a fury of venomous hate while at regular
intervals came the express train roar of the twelve fifteen and sixteen
inch guns

Its almost worth while to have lived through those months in The
Salient said Barry to get the full enjoyment of this experience
Well do I remember the day when our O C asked for retaliation and
was told he could have six rounds I think it was or eight Meanwhile
our trenches and dugcuts were going up in bloody mud

I think we might as well go below said the Australian They will be
coming in presently

But Barry and the M O remained long after the first coming in shells
began to drop around That barrage so long waited for and so ardently
desired was worth some risk

Soon the wounded began to arrive and throughout the whole night the
M O and his staff were busy at their work On the arrival of the zero
hour the barrage lifted

Well good luck go with the boys said the Australian fervently
They are out and over now Well get some of them presently

Throughout the night a stream of walking wounded kept flowing in
Jubilant exultant in spite of their pain they bore with them the
joyful report that they had shifted the Hun from his trenches and his
deep dugouts and were still advancing Singing at the top of their
voices they came limping in bloody and muddy but wild with exultation
and joy The day long looked for by the Canadians had arrived They were
getting something of their own back

The next day revealed the full extent of the achievement The whole
Canadian line had swept forward for over a thousand yards had captured
strong points a fortified sunken road the famous sugar refinery and
overrunning their objective had captured the village of Courcelette as
well It was a gallant little fight and quite a notable achievement

After two days the battalion was pulled out having suffered
comparatively slight losses and more than ready to return when the
opportunity should come

The next three weeks were spent in minor operations consolidating
positions repelling counterattacks and preparing for the real big
go in which the Canadians were to take their part in the advance of
the whole allied line after which the battalion was sent into reserve
for a few days respite

The Canadian line was gradually wearing thin but the spirit of those
who survived was the spirit of the whole allied linethe spirit that
claimed victory and was not to be denied As to the nature of the task
awaiting them however they well knew that it was to be a fight in
which the last ounce of resolution and only the last ounce would carry
them through to their objective

The experiences of the allies during the past months had wrought in
them a settled conviction that victory was awaiting them and a settled
resolution that that victory they would secure at all cost soever

At length the day arrived a dull October day overhung with rain clouds
and thick with chill mist On the parade ground the battalion was drawn
up for the service which always preceded an attack

The operations of the past month had reduced the battalion to about half
its fighting strength Only some five hundred men with officers barely
sufficient to direct their movements looked back at Barry through the
mist as he faced them for the service

Truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he read
The psalm might have been written for the occasion

He only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence I shall not be
moved

My soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him

He only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence I shall not be
moved

In God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my
refuge is in God

Trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him
God is a refuge for us

Barry made only a single comment upon the psalm Men nothing can move
God and nothing can move those whose trust is in God Remember God is
to be trusted

The reading was followed by the General Confession the Absolution and
a brief extemporary prayer concluding with the Lords Prayer As Barry
was mounting his horse a runner brought him an order from his divisional
chief directing him to report at the casualty clearing station in
Albert for immediate duty He carried the order to the O C

Look at this he stormed

Too bad Too bad said the O C Rotten luck for you

Look here sir said Barry I have always gone up with the battalion
and I think

I fancy they are getting on to you Dunbar You know you have rather
shirked the C C S duty said the O C with a smile

Isnt there some way out of this If I got a substitute

A soldier obeys orders Captain Dunbar said the O C gravely

Yes sir I know but

And he doesnt say but continued the O C No Barry he added in
a kindly voice I have no responsibility or authority in this Id be
glad to have you come up with us We are going into the big thing this
time I know but perhaps its just as well You go your way and well
go ours Id like to say this to you however my boy you have been a
great help to me with the men

His tone was grave but kind and it sent to Barrys heart a chill of
foreboding Goodbye Barry he added shaking hands with him

Goodbye sir Good luck sir May I say sir said Barry that you
have helped me immensely with my duty

Do you say so Barry said the O C a note of surprise in his voice
Im delighted to know that

God keep you sir said Barry earnestly

Thank you sir We are in His keeping arent we and turning in his
saddle he gave the order to advance

Barry rode with the column to the very mouth of the communication trench
running to Pozieres dropping into step with each company commander for
a time and leaving each with a cheery word of farewell At the mouth
of the trench he stood watching the men as they stepped down and out
of his sight giving them a word of good cheer and good luck as they
passed and receiving in return answering smiles and greetings Then
with eyes unseeing he rode back to camp heavy of heart for he knew
well that many of these faces he would see no more

The zero hour was fixed for five a m the following morning As the
hour drew near Barry at his work in the C C S found in his heart
the words of the psalm My soul wait thou only upon God    I shall
not be moved That wounds and death were awaiting many of them he well
knew and his prayer was that they might meet the fate appointed them
with unshaken faith and courage

By seven oclock the wounded began to arrive and an hour later the C
A M C marquee was filled to overflowing with a cue of wounded men
forming outside in the falling rain The suffering in their pale and
patient faces stirred in him a poignant sympathy There was the chaplain
service tent adjoining He ran to find the chaplain in charge

Tell me he said may we use your marquee for wounded men

Sure thing It will never be used for a better purpose

Barry returned to the O C of the C C S

Why not direct that a part of this stream be sent to the adjoining tent
for registration and for antitetanus hypodermics These poor chaps are
standing out in the rain chilled to the bone and ready to drop

For Heavens sake do it said the O C We are really up against it
here Can you take that off my hands

Ill try said Barry

In a few minutes the congestion at the door of the marquee was relieved
and the wounded men to their own vast comfort were bestowed upon the
benches and chairs in the chaplain service tent But something further
was necessary to their comfort

Draper said Barry to the chaplain in charge of the tent you see
these men They have had nothing to eat since last night They have
fought a battle been wounded and walked out some five miles or so
since then Its eight oclock now What about it

What about it exclaimed the chaplain You watch me

He ran to the Y M C A tent enlisted the secretarys aid and in
twenty minutes they together had transported to the chaplain service
tent coffee and cocoa urns and with an organised band of assistants
were supplying the wounded with warming and comforting nourishment
Never had those splendid services more quickly and effectively justified
their place in the army

With the wounded came rumours more or less fantastic of disaster
Something terrible had befallen the whole Canadian line It was
difficult to get at the truth As with all rumours they contradicted
each other and left the mind in a chaos of perplexity The battalion had
run into wire where the machine guns had found it the battalion was
practically wiped out it had found cover in a trench and was still
holding on the O C was wounded the O C was killed and with him
every company commander

Again and again Barry sent men to the signals to learn the truth but
it was found impossible to get a message through That an overwhelming
disaster had befallen his battalion was abundantly evident from the
numbers of wounded With his heart growing numb with pain he struggled
with his work Gradually he was forced to accept as true that a large
proportion of the battalion were casualties that the O C was wounded
possibly dying that many of the officers had fallen and that the
remainder were still holding a precarious position and fighting for
their lives

I shall not be moved he had read to them last night The promise was
being fulfilled in the men of his battalion They could die at the
wire or in the trench but they could not be moved While mechanically
carrying on his work his mind was with the fighting dying remnant
of his comrades The O C of the C C S passing on his rounds found
Barry carrying on with tears blinding his eyes so that he could hardly
see the figures he was entering in his record

Your men are having a hell of a time I hear said the O C I say
boy he added glancing at Barrys haggard face let up for a while

Im all right sir said Barry through his teeth Excuse me really
Im all right It is a bit difficult to carry on when you know that your
friends are being cut to pieces but Im all right sir

All right my boy said the O C were up against it today Ill
come for you in a few minutes and well have a bit to eat

Barry shook his head He was too sick to eat but the O C knew better
than he just what he wanted In a few minutes he returned with an
assistant who took Barrys place

Come along boy said the O C cheerfully We have got to feed the
living that we may care for the wounded and dying

You are quite right sir said Barry I am ashamed of myself Ill be
fit in a few minutes

Dont apologise for one moment said the colonel if you felt any
less deeply than you do youd be something less than a man Well get
into touch with the Divisional Headquarters and try to get the facts

He had no sooner reached his private room than his signaller informed
him that Divisional Headquarters had just been trying to get him It
took some time however to get the message through Meantime the
Colonel was handling Barry with a wise and skillful touch He made him
eat and eat heartily seeking to divert his mind in the meantime from
the disaster that had befallen the battalion to the big issues at stake
and pointing out with resolute cheerfulness that the calamity that had
befallen the battalion was only a temporary setback

Were winning my boy and were paying the price he said

At length signals got the D H Q and called the colonel to the phone
After a few minutes conversation the O C called Barry

The general wants to speak to you padre and Barry with an
apprehensive heart went to the phone

Oh that you Captain Dunbar It was the generals voice and somehow
it carried with it an atmosphere of calm and cheerful confidence How
are you getting on

Oh sir very well We are terribly anxious of course

Thats natural said the general quietly We have had rather a
serious reverse Your whole brigade met with wire and I fear they
suffered heavily The men behaved with great steadiness and are still
splendidly holding We are of course making every effort to relieve
them and with good hope of success

Have you heard of my O C inquired Barry

I fear rather bad news Dunbar Indeed I fear he is seriously wounded
We have sent him straight on to Contay Your officers have suffered
quite severely

Have you heard what the casualties are sir

Not exactly replied the General We shall not know until evening
but we must be prepared for a heavy loss By the way can you be spared
from the casualty clearing station I hear you are doing fine work
there If you can run up I can send my car for you

Im afraid not sir just now Perhaps later on in the afternoon

Let me speak to Colonel James said the general

The O C came to the phone

Yes sir he saidWell we are short handed just nowHe is really
necessary at the present momentYes later on well send him upVery
well sirWe are doing our best

The calm and confident bearing of his superior officer made Barry
ashamed of the unnerving emotion from which he had been suffering all
morning He returned to his work resolved to put aside all personal
considerations The thing in which they were engaged was vastly more
important than the fate of any individual or of any battalion Victory
was necessary was guaranteed and was demanding its price That price
was being paid and to that price every man must make his contribution

Toward night the stream of wounded gradually grew less and the O C
sent Barry in a returning ambulance up to the Divisional Headquarters
The serenity with which the general received him did much to restore
Barrys poise which had been severely shaken by the strain of the night
and day with the wounded in the casualty clearing station and by the
heartracking agony he had suffered over the loss of his comrades

Come in Dunbar said the general kindly Take a seat for a few
minutes Have a cigar These you will find are good I think

Thank you sir I will take a cigarette if I may said Barry helping
himself from a box on the table

He had not been many minutes in the dugout until he began to catch
the reactions of the place The spirit was one of controlled but
concentrated energy It was the spirit of the divisional commander
and it passed from him to the humblest orderly in the room There
was swiftness of action alertness of mind and with these a complete
absence of hurry or confusion Runners were continually arriving with
urgent messages phones insisting upon immediate answer officers coming
in with business of vast importance but with no sign of flurry the
work of the Divisional Headquarters went swiftly and smoothly on

At length there was a pause in the rush of calls upon the generals
attention

Come in this way he said to Barry and led him to a smaller room at
the back of the dugout

Very comfortable quarters these They seem to have done themselves
quite well havent they It is most convenient for we certainly should
not have taken pains to construct such elaborate dugouts as these
we have fallen heir to Find a seat Dunbar I have got the latest
reports His voice was very gentle and very kindly Yes he
continued we have had a bad nights work Uncut wire and an enfilade
from a redoubt which should have been blown up The casualties are very
heavy

What are they Barry asked

Quite heavy Dunbar Im afraid Only some fifty have reported so far

Fifty cried Barry Out of five hundred

There will doubtless some more drop in added the general but we
must be prepared for a heavy loss far heavier both in officers and
men than we can afford The Battalion Headquarters was terribly wrecked
by a succession of direct hits Only a few of the staff escaped unhurt
Colonel Leighton was a fine officer I had a great admiration indeed
affection for him I know how you felt towards him and he to you

The steadiness in his voice brought quiet but the kindness in it
brought strength and comfort Barry became suddenly aware of the
crushing load of responsibility upon this gentlevoiced man He was
eager to help

I wish I could help you sir he said I am sure we are all ready to
do our best

I know that Dunbar and all are needed Major Duff has gone out badly
injured The only officers remaining unhurt in the front line are Major
Bayne and Captain Fraser both of whom are splendidly carrying on And
you too have given great help today Colonel James assures me that
your initiative and resourcefulness were of the greatest service to him
Oh by the way a message came through in a letter the other day that I
should have sent you but other things put it out of my mind I am sorry
to say He touched a bell You see I had to tell your wife Dunbar
of your determination to stay by us he added with a smile Get me my
private postbag please he said to the orderly He selected a letter
from a packet opened it and pointed to a page Barry recognised the
handwriting as his wifes He read

I need not assure you it was none of my familys doing to get that
appointment for Barry I was not surprised that he declined it but then
you see I know Barry He is at the place where I would want him to be

Barry kept his eyes steadily upon the words until he should be sure of
his voice His heart was thrilling with pride in the girl who had given
herself to him As the moments passed he there and then vowed that by
Gods grace he would not shame her nor belie her trust in him

Thank you sir he said quietly handing the letter back

Helps a bit eh what said the general We cant let our women down
can we

No sir said Barry Is there nothing I can do His voice was as
steady and quiet as the generals

Oh thank you just the C C S I fancy at present

At that point the door opened and the corps commander came in wearing
a very tired and anxious face

Bad business general he said with a single word of greeting and
ignoring Barry

Yes a very bad business sir said the divisional commander and
Barry fancied he caught a new note in his voice a note of sternness
almost of challenge

Seems that we missed that wire eh along here said the corps
commander putting his finger upon a map which lay on the table

We must have that patrolled very carefully you know There was a note
of criticism in his voice

Yes sir replied the corps commander courteously I wasnt at all
sure that the wire was cut and so reported

Ah

This strong point should have been removed continued the divisional
commander putting his finger upon a point of junction That I asked to
be done but McDowell seems to have missed it

Ah

The enfilade got us from that point of course There was no mistaking
the implication in the generals words

Ah You reported that eh

You will find it in my report sir My division has suffered very
heavily from that strong point

The corps commander turned and apparently observing Barry for the first
time started and said

You are

My friend Captain Dunbar said the general

Ah Captain Dunbar said the corps commander obviously annoyed at his
presence at the interview I trust Captain Dunbar is quite

Captain Dunbars reticence said the general with quiet courtesy can
be entirely trusted He has just been doing some fine work at the C C
S

Ah yes You are a padre Dunbar Oh I remember to have heard about
you Very glad indeed to meet you sir Well I must be off Well see
to that strong point at once general Goodnightgoodnight Dunbar

The general returned from seeing his visitor out Of course we keep
these things to ourselves

Of course answered Barry

And now said the general with a kindly smile I have kept the good
news to the last Your majority is coming through and here is a letter
which came in my care Now if you will excuse me Ill leave you to
take a bit of a rest Theres a cot if you want to lie down Then well
have a bite to eat later

Oh thank you very much said Barry eagerly taking the letter This
is good news indeed My letters have been going astray somehow I have
not had one for a week

As long as that said the general with uplifted brows

One sentence in his letter made music in Barrys heart

And oh my hearts beloved God has been good to me and to you for
when the war is over I hope there will be two of us to welcome daddy
back To which sentence Barry in his letter written in immediate
reply said

Yes dear dear heart God has been good to us in that he has given us
to each other and to us both this wonderful new life to carry on when
we are done

When the general returned he found Barry with his face on his arms and
dead asleep

Poor chap he said to his batman he is done up Let him rest a bit

They gave him an hour after which they had their bite together

Now general said Barry I should like to run up to Battalion
Headquarters I might be of use there

Thats quite all right said the general You will be glad to know
that that strong point has already been attended to You didnt hear the
row did you

No sir

Well the relief is going in and your men will soon be out

When Barry entered the Battalion Headquarters he found only Major Bayne
and Captain Neil with a signaller and a couple of runners completing
the arrangements for the relief

You Pilot exclaimed the major as he gripped his hand Now what the
devil brought you here

Couldnt help it major Simply had to come I have been trying to get
you all day said Barry

Awfully glad to see you old chap said Captain Neil for the major
was finding difficulty with his speech

How many left major said Barry

Five officers and seventy men said the major in a husky voice My
God how those boys stuck

I shall not be moved quoted Barry

Thats it Thats it said the major Not the devil himself let
alone the Huns could move them back from that wire What is it
Sergeant Matthews he inquired of the sergeant who came in at that
moment Have you completed your work

Sergeant Matthews was pale panting and exhausted Yes sir he said
I think so I didntI didntgo quite the full length of the trench
The boys said there was no one up there

But Sergeant Matthews thundered the major your orders were to go
to the very end of the trench You know this battalion never goes out
leaving its wounded behind

We had a full load sir said the sergeant leaning against the wall

Well you will have to go back said the major and complete the job
Can you carry on

Yes sir I think so sir

As he spoke Sergeant Matthews swayed along the wall and collapsed onto a
bench

Give him a shot of rum said the major curtly to a runner

Let me go major Ill take the party said Barry eagerly The
sergeant is all in Ive had an hours sleep and a feed and I feel quite
fit

Oh nonsense the sergeant will be all right soon said the major
impatiently

But major I should like to go The sergeant is played out and I am
perfectly fit We cant take the risk of leaving wounded men up there
in that trench Besides theres little danger now The strong point is
blown up so the general told me before I left

No Barry I wont allow it I wont take the chance said the major
My God man there are only five officers left I have lost every
friend I have got in the battalion except Neil here and you Im damned
if Im going to let you go out over No Mans Land

Steady now major said Barry Im going to take a walk to the end
of that trench just in case one of the boys should be there Dont say
no It must be done and done carefully

All right Barry said the major suddenly yielding Better take the
sergeant with you He knows the way and I guess hes all right now

The major and Captain Neil followed the party up the stairs and out into
the trench It was a beautiful starry night and all was quiet now along
the front

I dont like it said the major as he and Captain Neil stood together
watching the party away I feel queer about it Neil I tell you I wish
I hadnt let him go but he is so darned stubborn about what he thinks
is his duty

By Jove Major he always bucks me up somehow said Captain Neil

Bucks us all up said the major and he turned to take up again the
heavy burden of responsibility so suddenly and so terribly laid upon
him The relief had been completed and the last N C O had just
reported all clear The Headquarters Company now reduced to a poor
half dozen were standing ready to move when the telephone rang

Yes doctor said the major answering it Oh my God My God Not
that doctor Oh God help us all Ill be right down Its the Pilot
Neil he said turning to his friend Just take charge will you
please I must run

Breathless he arrived at the R A P

Any chance doctor he asked of the M O who was standing awaiting
him at the door

Not the very least major and he only has a few minutes He wants
you

Now may God help me said the major standing quite still a moment or
two How did he get it he asked of a stretcher bearer Do you know

Yes sir we had just picked up the last man Sergeant Matthews got a
wound in the leg and we had to carry him Just as we started they
got to shelling pretty bad and we dropped into a hole I looked over my
shoulder and there was the Pilot the chaplain sir I mean with his
body spread over Sergeant Matthews to keep off the shrapnel It was
there he got it

Damn Sergeant Matthews exclaimed the major and passed on

Barry was lying on a stretcher very white and very still but the smile
with which he welcomed the major was very bright

Awfully sorryfor youold chap he whispered Couldnt
reallyhelpityou knowwegotthem allImawfullygladto
see youjust a minutebeforebefore

The major by this time was weeping quietly

You havebeena good friendto memajor Wehave hada
goodtimetogether Saygoodbyetothe boysformeandto
toNeil

Oh Barry boy said the major brokenly Its hard to have you go
You have helped us all

Barry fumbled with weak fingers at his breast The major opened his
tunic thinking that he needed air

Mymyletter he whispered

The major took the letter from his breast pocket and put it in his
hand Barry held it a moment then carried it to his lips

Nowthatsallmajor he whispered
TellherIthankGodforherandfortheother
Majortellthe boysthatGodis good Neverto beafraidbut
tocarry on

It was his last word and there could be no better God is good Never
be afraid but carry on



CHAPTER XX

CARRY ON


The next day but one they carried the Pilot to his grave in the little
plot outside the walled cemetery on the outskirts of the city of Albert
It had been arranged that only a small guard should follow to the grave
But this plan was changed Sergeant Mackay who was the only sergeant
left after consulting the boys came to Major Bayne

The boys feel bad sir he said that they cant go with the Pilot
excuse me sir the chaplain

Do they said the major We want to avoid congestion in the streets
and besides we dont want to expose the men They are still shelling the
city you know

I know sir replied the sergeant The boys have heard the shells
before sir And theres not so many of them that they will crowd the
streets much

Let them go sergeant said the major and Sergeant Mackay went back
with the word to the men And I want you to look like soldiers said
the sergeant for remember we are following a soldier to his grave

And look like soldiers they did with every button and bayonet shining
as they had never shone for battalion inspection

They had passed through an experience which had left them dazed they
had marched deliberately into the mouth of hell and had come back
stunned by what they had seen and heard incapable of emotion So they
thought till they learned that the Pilot had been killed Then they
knew that grief was still possible to them With their grief mingled a
kind of inexplicable wrath at the manner of his death

If it had been the O C now or any one else but Fatty Matthews said
Sergeant Mackay in disgust expressing the general opinion It is an
awful waste

Under the figure of the Virgin and Child leaning out in pity and appeal
over the shattered city through marching battalions going in and
coming out the little pitiful remnant made its way the band leading
the Brigade and Divisional Headquarters Staffs bringing up in the rear
The service was brief and simple a brother chaplain reading at the
majors suggestion the Psalm which Barry had read at his last Parade
Service with the battalion

At the conclusion of the service the divisional commander stepped
forward and said

May I offer the officers and men of this battalion my respectful
sympathy with them in the loss of their chaplain During these last
weeks I had come to know him well Captain Dunbar was a chaplain in
his brigade He was more He was a gallant officer a brave soldier
a loyalhearted Canadian The morale of this division is higher today
because he has been with us He did his duty to his country to his
comrades to his God What more can we ask than this for ourselves and
for our comrades

Then there was a little pause and Major Bayne began to speak At first
his voice was husky and tremulous but as he went on it gathered
strength and clearness He reminded them how when the chaplain came to
them first they did not understand him nor treat him quite fairly but
how in these last months he had carried the confidence and the love
of every officer and man in the battalion

Were the Commanding Officer here today he would tell as I have
often heard him tell how greatly the chaplain had contributed to the
discipline and to the morale of this battalion He helped us all to be
better soldiers and better men He never shrank from danger He never
faltered in duty He lived to help his comrades and to save a comrade he
gave his life at last

The major paused looked round upon the gallant remnant of a once
splendid battalion his lips quivering his eyes running over with
tears But he pulled himself together and continued with steady voice
to the end

But not to say these things am I speaking to you today I wish only to
give you this last message from our Sky Pilot This is the Pilots last
message Tell the boys that God is good and when they are afraid to
trust Him and carry on And for myself men I want to say that he
was the only man that showed me what God is like

In that company of men who had looked steadfastly into the face of
death there were no eyes without tears many of them were openly
weeping

When the major had finished the officers present beginning with the
divisional commander came and stood at the head of the open grave for a
single moment then silently saluted and turned away It was the duty
of Bugler Pat McCann to sound The Last Post but poor Pat was too
overcome with his sobbing at once to perform this last duty Whereupon
the runner Pickles standing with rigid stony face beside his chum
took the bugle from his hands and there sounded forth that most
beautiful and most poignant of all musical sounds known to British
soldiers the world over The Last Post ending with that last high
longdrawn heartpiercing note of farewell

Then because the war was yet to be won they carried on the
battalion marching away to a merry tune

Beside Barrys grave there still lingered three men the divisional
commander Major Bayne and Captain Neil

I am thinking of that little girl in London said the divisional
commander and for the first time his voice broke The others waited
looking at him We will hold back this news for a couple of days and I
think major you ought to go and

No generalMy God no Dont ask me The major was profoundly
agitated Send Neil here He knows her well and his wife is her great
friend

Very well major I think that will be better said the general in his
courteous gentle voice You know her Captain Fraser and you can be
better spared

And so it was arranged Captain Neil telegraphed Paula to meet him at
Boulogne and together they made the journey to London carrying with
them sad and fearful hearts

They found Phyllis in a little flat which her mother had taken When
she saw them her face went white and her hands flew to her bosom
Speechless and with a great fear in her wideopen brown eyes she stood
looking from one to the other waiting for their message Paula went to
her and without a word put her arms round her and held her close

I know Paula she said putting her gently away from her I know
what you have to tell me Barry is dead My dear love is dead Her
voice was tender soft and low Dont fear to tell me Neil she said
See I am quite steady She put out her hand that he might see that
there was no tremour in it

Sit down darling besought Paula again winding her arms about her

No no let me stand Paula dear See I am quite strong Now tell me
about it Neilall about it You were his dear friend you know

Her voice so sweet so soft so perfectly controlled helped Captain
Neil with his task It seemed an offence that he should intrude any
exhibition of grief or emotion upon the serene calm of this young girl
standing so straight so proud and regarding him with such brave eyes

Then Captain Neil told his tale He began with the last service upon the
Parade Ground before the battalion moved into action He told of Barrys
bitter disappointment and of their relief that he was not allowed to
accompany them to the front line He told of Barrys long day at the
casualty clearing station and of his service to the wounded and of how
good the divisional commander had been to him that night

It was there he got your letter Phyllis

Oh he got my letter Im so glad whispered the girl with a quick
breath and a sudden flushing of her pale cheeks He knew He knew

I have his letter in reply here said Captain Neil handing it to her

She took it in both her hands kissed it tenderly as if caressing a
child and put it in her bosom

Please go on she said and Captain Neil took up his tale again He
told how the major tried to persuade him not to go out after the wounded
that night

But of course he would go the girl said with a proud little smile
at which Captain Neils selfcontrol quite gave way and he could only
look at her piteously through his tears

Oh Im so sorry she said gently Cant you go on I want to hear so
much every bit but if you cant

At which Captain Neil gripped himself hard and went on and so he went
out and they searched the trench from end to end They found one poor
chap whose leg was badly smashed

Oh Im so glad they found him whispered Phyllis

Then Sergeant Matthews got his wound and the shells began to fall
They took refuge in a shell hole and there while covering Fatty
Matthews from the breaking shrapnel Barry got his wound

Captain Neil was forced to pause again in the recital of his story
After a few minutes he told of how they carried him to his grave and
laid him in the cemetery outside the city of Albert

The boys were all there There were not many of them left he said

How many she asked

Seventy only out of five hundred and four who went over the parapet
two nights before

Ah poor gallant boys I love them I love them all said the girl
clasping her hands together

They were all terribly broken up as they stood about the grave and no
wonder No wonder Then the divisional commander made a little speech
and then our own major gave them Barrys last message

Tell me said the girl gently as Captain Neil paused

It was this said Captain Neil Tell the boys that God is good and
when they are afraid to trust Him and carry on

That was like him she said That was like Barry Oh Paula she
cried turning to her friend Im so happy It was a beautiful closing
to a beautiful life He was a beautiful boy Paula wasnt he His body
was beautiful his soul was beautiful his life was beautiful and the
ending oh was beautiful Oh Paula God is good I am so glad he gave
Barry to me and gave me to him Oh Im sohappysohappy Her
voice sank into a whisper Then after a few moments of silence with a
little piteous cry she suddenly broke forth But Paula Paula he is
gone I shall never see him again

Paula held her arms tightly about her sobbing as if her own heart were
broken but Phyllis recovered herself quickly

No no she said softly as if counselling her own heart I must
remember God is good he said and so Paula I must not be afraid
God was good to him He will be good to me He will be good to his
child Her voice sank again into a whisper She stood silent with eyes
looking into the far distance Then in a clear firm voice she said
I will not be afraid God is good I will carry on

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
