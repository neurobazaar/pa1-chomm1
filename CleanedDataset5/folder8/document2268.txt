Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The Tragedie of Anthonie and Cleopatra






Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The Tragedie of Anthonie and Cleopatra

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

The Tragedie of Anthonie and Cleopatra

Actus Primus Scoena Prima

Enter Demetrius and Philo

 Philo Nay but this dotage of our Generals
Oreflowes the measure those his goodly eyes
That ore the Files and Musters of the Warre
Haue glowd like plated Mars
Now bend now turne
The Office and Deuotion of their view
Vpon a Tawny Front His Captaines heart
Which in the scuffles of great Fights hath burst
The Buckles on his brest reneages all temper
And is become the Bellowes and the Fan
To coole a Gypsies Lust

Flourish Enter Anthony Cleopatra her Ladies the Traine with
Eunuchs
fanning her

Looke where they come
Take but good note and you shall see in him
The triple Pillar of the world transformd
Into a Strumpets Foole Behold and see

 Ant Theres beggery in the loue that can be reckond
 Cleo Ile set a bourne how farre to be beloud

When shrilltongud Fuluia scolds The Messengers

 Ant Let Rome in Tyber melt and the wide Arch
Of the raingd Empire fall Heere is my space
Kingdomes are clay Our dungie earth alike
Feeds Beast as Man the Noblenesse of life

And such a twaine can doot in which I binde
One paine of punishment the world to weete
We stand vp Peerelesse

 Cleo Excellent falshood
Why did he marry Fuluia and not loue her
Ile seeme the Foole I am not Anthony will be himselfe

 Ant But stirrd by Cleopatra
Now for the loue of Loue and her soft houres
Lets not confound the time with Conference harsh
Theres not a minute of our liues should stretch
Without some pleasure now What sport to night
 Cleo Heare the Ambassadors

 Ant Fye wrangling Queene
Whom euery thing becomes to chide to laugh
To weepe who euery passion fully striues
To make it selfe in Thee faire and admird
No Messenger but thine and all alone to night
Weel wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people Come my Queene
Last night you did desire it Speake not to vs

Exeunt with the Traine

 Dem Is Caesar with Anthonius prizd so slight
 Philo Sir sometimes when he is not Anthony

 Cleo Nay pray you seeke no colour for your going
But bid farewell and goe

Breed scrupulous faction The hated growne to strength
Are newly growne to Loue The condemnd Pompey

Into the hearts of such as haue not thriued
Vpon the present state whose Numbers threaten
And quietnesse growne sicke of rest would purge
By any desperate change My more particular
And that which most with you should safe my going
Is Fuluias death

 Cleo Though age from folly could not giue me freedom
It does from childishnesse Can Fuluia dye
 Ant Shes dead my Queene
Looke heere and at thy Soueraigne leysure read
The Garboyles she awakd at the last best
See when and where shee died

 Cleo O most false Loue
Where be the Sacred Violles thou shouldst fill
With sorrowfull water Now I see I see
In Fuluias death how mine receiud shall be

 Ant Quarrell no more but bee prepard to know
The purposes I beare which are or cease
As you shall giue th aduice By the fire
That quickens Nylus slime I go from hence

Therefore be deafe to my vnpittied Folly
And all the Gods go with you Vpon your Sword
Sit Lawrell victory and smooth successe
Be strewd before your feete

 Ant Let vs go
Come Our separation so abides and flies
That thou reciding heere goes yet with mee
And I hence fleeting heere remaine with thee
Away

Enter Octauius reading a Letter Lepidus and their Traine

 Caes You may see Lepidus and henceforth know
It is not Caesars Naturall vice to hate
One great Competitor From Alexandria
This is the newes He fishes drinkes and wastes
The Lampes of night in reuell Is not more manlike
Then Cleopatra nor the Queene of Ptolomy
More Womanly then he Hardly gaue audience
Or vouchsafe to thinke he had Partners You
Shall finde there a man who is th abstracts of all faults
That all men follow

 Lep I must not thinke
There are euils enow to darken all his goodnesse
His faults in him seeme as the Spots of Heauen
More fierie by nights Blacknesse Hereditarie
Rather then purchaste what he cannot change
Then what he chooses

 Caes You are too indulgent Lets graunt it is not
Amisse to tumble on the bed of Ptolomy
To giue a Kingdome for a Mirth to sit
And keepe the turne of Tipling with a Slaue
To reele the streets at noone and stand the Buffet
With knaues that smels of sweate Say this becoms him
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Anthony
No way excuse his foyles when we do beare
So great waight in his lightnesse If he filld
His vacancie with his Voluptuousnesse
Full surfets and the drinesse of his bones
Call on him fort But to confound such time
That drummes him from his sport and speakes as lowd
As his owne State and ours tis to be chid
As we rate Boyes who being mature in knowledge
Pawne their experience to their present pleasure
And so rebell to iudgement
Enter a Messenger

 Lep Heeres more newes

 Mes Thy biddings haue beene done  euerie houre
Most Noble Caesar shalt thou haue report
How tis abroad Pompey is strong at Sea
And it appeares he is beloud of those
That only haue feard Caesar to the Ports
The discontents repaire and mens reports
Giue him much wrongd

 Caes I should haue knowne no lesse
It hath bin taught vs from the primall state
That he which is was wisht vntill he were
And the ebbd man
Nere loud till nere worth loue
Comes feard by being lackd This common bodie
Like to a Vagabond Flagge vpon the Streame
Goes too and backe lacking the varrying tyde
To rot it selfe with motion

 Mes Caesar I bring thee word
Menacrates and Menas famous Pyrates
Makes the Sea serue them which they eare and wound
With keeles of euery kinde Many hot inrodes
They make in Italy the Borders Maritime
Lacke blood to thinke ont and flush youth reuolt
No Vessell can peepe forth but tis as soone
Taken as seene for Pompeyes name strikes more
Then could his Warre resisted
 Caesar Anthony
Leaue thy lasciuious Vassailes When thou once
Was beaten from Medena where thou slewst
Hirsius and Pansa Consuls at thy heele
Did Famine follow whom thou foughtst against
Though daintily brought vp with patience more
Then Sauages could suffer Thou didst drinke
The stale of Horses and the gilded Puddle
Which Beasts would cough at Thy pallat then did daine
The roughest Berry on the rudest Hedge
Yea like the Stagge when Snow the Pasture sheets
The barkes of Trees thou browsd On the Alpes
It is reported thou didst eate strange flesh
Which some did dye to looke on And all this
It wounds thine Honor that I speake it now
Was borne so like a Soldiour that thy cheeke
So much as lankd not

 Lep Tis pitty of him

 Caes Let his shames quickely
Driue him to Rome tis time we twaine
Did shew our selues ith Field and to that end
Assemble me immediate counsell Pompey
Thriues in our Idlenesse

 Lep To morrow Caesar
I shall be furnisht to informe you rightly
Both what by Sea and Land I can be able
To front this present time

 Caes Til which encounter it is my busines too Farwell

 Lep Farwell my Lord what you shal know mean time
Of stirres abroad I shall beseech you Sir
To let me be partaker

 Caesar Doubt not sir I knew it for my Bond

 Cleo Oh Charmion
Where thinkst thou he is now Stands he or sits he
Or does he walke Or is he on his Horse
Oh happy horse to beare the weight of Anthony
Do brauely Horse for wotst thou whom thou mooust

Or murmuring wheres my Serpent of old Nyle
For so he cals me Now I feede my selfe
With most delicious poyson Thinke on me
That am with Phoebus amorous pinches blacke
And wrinkled deepe in time Broadfronted Caesar
When thou wast heere aboue the ground I was
A morsell for a Monarke and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
There would he anchor his Aspect and dye
With looking on his life
Enter Alexas from Caesar

 Cleo Mine eare must plucke it thence

 Alex Good Friend quoth he
Say the firme Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an Oyster at whose foote
To mend the petty present I will peece
Her opulent Throne with Kingdomes All the East
Say thou shall call her Mistris So he nodded
And soberly did mount an Armegaunt Steede
Who neighd so hye that what I would haue spoke
Was beastly dumbe by him

 Cleo What was he sad or merry
 Alex Like to the time oth yeare between y extremes
Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merrie

 Cleo Oh well diuided disposition Note him
Note him good Charmian tis the man but note him
He was not sad for he would shine on those
That make their lookes by his He was not merrie
Which seemd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his ioy but betweene both

The violence of either thee becomes
So dos it no mans else Metst thou my Posts

 Pom Whiles we are sutors to their Throne decayes

 Mene We ignorant of our selues
Begge often our owne harmes which the wise Powres
Deny vs for our good so finde we profit
By loosing of our Prayers

 Pom I shall do well
The people loue me and the Sea is mine
My powers are Cressent and my Auguring hope
Sayes it will come toth full Marke Anthony
In Egypt sits at dinner and will make
No warres without doores Caesar gets money where
He looses hearts Lepidus flatters both
Of both is flatterd but he neither loues
Nor either cares for him

 Mene Caesar and Lepidus are in the field
A mighty strength they carry

 Pom Where haue you this Tis false

 Mene From Siluius Sir

 Pom He dreames I know they are in Rome together
Looking for Anthony but all the charmes of Loue
Salt Cleopatra soften thy wand lip
Let Witchcraft ioyne with Beauty Lust with both
Tye vp the Libertine in a field of Feasts
Keepe his Braine fuming Epicurean Cookes
Sharpen with cloylesse sawce his Appetite
That sleepe and feeding may prorogue his Honour
Euen till a Lethied dulnesse

 Var This is most certaine that I shall deliuer
Marke Anthony is euery houre in Rome
Expected Since he went from Egypt tis
A space for farther Trauaile

 Pom I could haue giuen lesse matter
A better eare Menas I did not thinke
This amorous Surfetter would haue donnd his Helme
For such a petty Warre His Souldiership
Is twice the other twaine But let vs reare
The higher our Opinion that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypts Widdow plucke
The neere Lustwearied Anthony

 Mene I cannot hope
Caesar and Anthony shall well greet together
His Wife thats dead did trespasses to Caesar
His Brother wand vpon him although I thinke
Not moud by Anthony

 Pom I know not Menas
How lesser Enmities may giue way to greater
Weret not that we stand vp against them all
Twer pregnant they should square between themselues
For they haue entertained cause enough
To draw their swords but how the feare of vs
May Ciment their diuisions and binde vp
The petty difference we yet not know
Beet as our Gods will hauet it onely stands
Our liues vpon to vse our strongest hands
Come Menas

Exeunt

Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus

 Lep Good Enobarbus tis a worthy deed
And shall become you well to intreat your Captaine
To soft and gentle speech

 Enob I shall intreat him
To answer like himselfe if Caesar moue him
Let Anthony looke ouer Caesars head
And speake as lowd as Mars By Iupiter
Were I the wearer of Anthonios Beard
I would not shauet to day

 Lep Tis not a time for priuate stomacking

 Eno Euery time serues for the matter that is then

 Ant If we compose well heere to Parthia
Hearke Ventidius

 Caesar I do not know Mecenas aske Agrippa

 Lep Noble Friends
That which combind vs was most great and let not
A leaner action rend vs Whats amisse
May it be gently heard When we debate
Our triuiall difference loud we do commit
Murther in healing wounds Then Noble Partners
The rather for I earnestly beseech
Touch you the sowrest points with sweetest tearmes
Nor curstnesse grow toth matter

 Ant Tis spoken well
Were we before our Armies and to fight
I should do thus
Flourish

 Caes Welcome to Rome

 Ant Thanke you

 Caes Sit

 Ant Sit sir

 Caes Nay then

 Ant I learne you take things ill which are not so
Or being concerne you not

 Caes I must be laught at if or for nothing or a little I
Should say my selfe offended and with you
Chiefely ith world More laught at that I should
Once name you derogately when to sound your name
It not concernd me

 Ant My being in Egypt Caesar what wast to you
 Caes No more then my reciding heere at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt yet if you there
Did practise on my State your being in Egypt
Might be my question

 Ant How intend you practisd
 Caes You may be pleasd to catch at mine intent
By what did heere befall me Your Wife and Brother
Made warres vpon me and their contestation
Was Theame for you you were the word of warre

 Ant You do mistake your busines my Brother neuer
Did vrge me in his Act I did inquire it
And haue my Learning from some true reports
That drew their swords with you did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours
And make the warres alike against my stomacke
Hauing alike your cause Of this my Letters
Before did satisfie you If youl patch a quarrell
As matter whole you haue to make it with
It must not be with this

 Caes You praise your selfe by laying defects of iudgement
to me but you patcht vp your excuses

 Anth Not so not so
I know you could not lacke I am certaine ont
Very necessity of this thought that I
Your Partner in the cause gainst which he fought
Could not with gracefull eyes attend those Warres
Which fronted mine owne peace As for my wife
I would you had her spirit in such another
The third oth world is yours which with a Snaffle
You may pace easie but not such a wife

 Enobar Would we had all such wiues that the men
might go to Warres with the women

 Anth So much vncurbable her Garboiles Caesar
Made out of her impatience which not wanted
Shrodenesse of policie to I greeuing grant
Did you too much disquiet for that you must
But say I could not helpe it

 Caesar I wrote to you when rioting in Alexandria you
Did pocket vp my Letters and with taunts
Did gibe my Misiue out of audience

 Ant Sir he fell vpon me ere admitted then
Three Kings I had newly feasted and did want
Of what I was ith morning but next day
I told him of my selfe which was as much
As to haue askt him pardon Let this Fellow
Be nothing of our strife if we contend
Out of our question wipe him

 Caesar You haue broken the Article of your oath
which you shall neuer haue tongue to charge me with

 Lep Soft Caesar

 Ant No Lepidus let him speake
The Honour is Sacred which he talks on now
Supposing that I lackt it but on Caesar
The Article of my oath

 Caesar To lend me Armes and aide when I requird
them the which you both denied

 Anth Neglected rather
And then when poysoned houres had bound me vp
From mine owne knowledge as neerely as I may
Ile play the penitent to you But mine honesty
Shall not make poore my greatnesse nor my power
Worke without it Truth is that Fuluia
To haue me out of Egypt made Warres heere
For which my selfe the ignorant motiue do
So farre aske pardon as befits mine Honour
To stoope in such a case

 Lep Tis Noble spoken

 Mece If it might please you to enforce no further
The griefes betweene ye to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present neede
Speakes to attone you

 Lep Worthily spoken Mecenas

 Enobar Or if you borrow one anothers Loue for the
instant you may when you heare no more words of
Pompey returne it againe you shall haue time to wrangle
in when you haue nothing else to do

 Anth Thou art a Souldier onely speake no more

 Enob That trueth should be silent I had almost forgot

 Anth You wrong this presence therefore speake no
more

 Enob Go too then your Considerate stone

 Caesar I do not much dislike the matter but
The manner of his speech fort cannot be
We shall remaine in friendship our conditions
So diffring in their acts Yet if I knew
What Hoope should hold vs staunch from edge to edge
Ath world I would persue it

 Agri Giue me leaue Caesar

 Caesar Speake Agrippa

 Agri Thou hast a Sister by the Mothers side admird
Octauia Great Mark Anthony is now a widdower

 Caesar Say not say Agrippa if Cleopater heard you your
proofe were well deserued of rashnesse

 Anth I am not marryed Caesar let me heere Agrippa
further speake

 Agri To hold you in perpetuall amitie
To make you Brothers and to knit your hearts
With an vnslipping knot take Anthony
Octauia to his wife whose beauty claimes
No worse a husband then the best of men whose
Vertue and whose generall graces speake
That which none else can vtter By this marriage
All little Ielousies which now seeme great
And all great feares which now import their dangers
Would then be nothing Truths would be tales
Where now halfe tales be truths her loue to both
Would each to other and all loues to both
Draw after her Pardon what I haue spoke
For tis a studied not a present thought
By duty ruminated

 Anth Will Caesar speake
 Caesar Not till he heares how Anthony is toucht
With what is spoke already

 Anth What power is in Agrippa
If I would say Agrippa be it so
To make this good
 Caesar The power of Caesar
And his power vnto Octauia

 Anth May I neuer
To this good purpose that so fairely shewes
Dreame of impediment let me haue thy hand
Further this act of Grace and from this houre
The heart of Brothers gouerne in our Loues
And sway our great Designes

 Caesar Theres my hand
A Sister I bequeath you whom no Brother
Did euer loue so deerely Let her liue
To ioyne our kingdomes and our hearts and neuer
Flie off our Loues againe

 Lepi Happily Amen

 Ant I did not think to draw my Sword gainst Pompey
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late vpon me I must thanke him onely
Least my remembrance suffer ill report
At heele of that defie him

 Lepi Time cals vpons
Of vs must Pompey presently be sought
Or else he seekes out vs

 Anth Where lies he
 Caesar About the MountMesena

 Anth What is his strength by land
 Caesar Great and encreasing
But by Sea he is an absolute Master

 Anth So is the Fame
Would we had spoke together Hast we for it
Yet ere we put our selues in Armes dispatch we
The businesse we haue talkt of

 Caesar With most gladnesse
And do inuite you to my Sisters view
Whether straight Ile lead you

 Anth Let vs Lepidus not lacke your companie

 Lep Noble Anthony not sickenesse should detaine
me

Flourish Exit omnes Manet Enobarbus Agrippa Mecenas

 Mec Welcome from aegypt Sir

 Eno Halfe the heart of Caesar worthy Mecenas My
honourable Friend Agrippa

 Agri Good Enobarbus

 Mece We haue cause to be glad that matters are so
well disgested you staid well byt in Egypt

 Enob I Sir we did sleepe day out of countenaunce
and made the night light with drinking

 Mece Eight WildeBoares rosted whole at a breakfast
and but twelue persons there Is this true
 Eno This was but as a Flye by an Eagle we had much
more monstrous matter of Feast which worthily deserued
noting

 Mecenas Shes a most triumphant Lady if report be
square to her

 Enob When she first met Marke Anthony she purst
vp his heart vpon the Riuer of Sidnis

 Agri There she appeard indeed or my reporter deuisd
well for her

 Eno I will tell you
The Barge she sat in like a burnisht Throne
Burnt on the water the Poope was beaten Gold
Purple the Sailes and so perfumed that
The Windes were Louesicke
With them the Owers were Siluer
Which to the tune of Flutes kept stroke and made
The water which they beate to follow faster
As amorous of their strokes For her owne person
It beggerd all discription she did lye
In her Pauillion cloth of Gold of Tissue
Orepicturing that Venus where we see
The fancie outworke Nature On each side her
Stood pretty Dimpled Boyes like smiling Cupids
With diuers coulourd Fannes whose winde did seeme
To gloue the delicate cheekes which they did coole
And what they vndid did

 Agrip Oh rare for Anthony

 Eno Her Gentlewoman like the Nereides
So many Mermaides tended her ith eyes
And made their bends adornings At the Helme
A seeming Mermaide steeres The Silken Tackle
Swell with the touches of those Flowersoft hands
That yarely frame the office From the Barge
A strange inuisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adiacent Wharfes The Citty cast
Her people out vpon her and Anthony
Enthrond ith Marketplace did sit alone
Whisling toth ayre which but for vacancie
Had gone to gaze on Cleopater too
And made a gap in Nature

 Agri Rare Egiptian

 Eno Vpon her landing Anthony sent to her
Inuited her to Supper she replyed
It should be better he became her guest
Which she entreated our Courteous Anthony
Whom nere the word of no woman hard speake
Being barberd ten times ore goes to the Feast
And for his ordinary paies his heart
For what his eyes eate onely

 Agri Royall Wench
She made great Caesar lay his Sword to bed
He ploughed her and she cropt

 Eno I saw her once
Hop forty Paces through the publicke streete
And hauing lost her breath she spoke and panted
That she did make defect perfection
And breathlesse powre breath forth

 Mece Now Anthony must leaue her vtterly

 Eno Neuer he will not
Age cannot wither her nor custome stale
Her infinite variety other women cloy
The appetites they feede but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies For vildest things
Become themselues in her that the holy Priests
Blesse her when she is Riggish

 Mece If Beauty Wisedome Modesty can settle
The heart of Anthony Octauia is
A blessed Lottery to him

 Agrip Let vs go Good Enobarbus make your selfe
my guest whilst you abide heere

 Eno Humbly Sir I thanke you

Exeunt

 Anth Speake this no more

To scourge th ingratitude that despightfull Rome

The offers we haue sent you

 Caesar Theres the point

 Ant Which do not be entreated too
But waigh what it is worth imbracd
 Caesar And what may follow to try a larger Fortune

 Pom You haue made me offer
Of Cicelie Sardinia and I must
Rid all the Sea of Pirats Then to send
Measures of Wheate to Rome this greed vpon
To part with vnhackt edges and beare backe
Our Targes vndinted

 Omnes Thats our offer

 Pom Know then I came before you heere
A man prepard
To take this offer But Marke Anthony
Put me to some impatience though I loose
The praise of it by telling You must know
When Caesar and your Brother were at blowes
Your Mother came to Cicelie and did finde
Her welcome Friendly

 Ant I haue heard it Pompey
And am well studied for a liberall thanks
Which I do owe you

 Pom Let me haue your hand

 Enob If I were bound to Diuine of this vnity I wold

 Enob I thinke so too But you shall finde the band

very strangler of their Amity Octauia is of a holy cold
and still conuersation

 Men Who would not haue his wife so
 Eno Not he that himselfe is not so which is Marke
Anthony he will to his Egyptian dish againe then shall
the sighes of Octauia blow the fire vp in Caesar and as I

Requires to liue in Egypt which not granted
He Lessons his Requests and to thee sues
To let him breath betweene the Heauens and Earth

 Cleo Wherefore is this
 Ant To let a Fellow that will take rewards
And say God quit you be familiar with
My playfellow your hand this Kingly Seale
And plighter of high hearts O that I were

To follow Caesar in his Triumph since
Thou hast bin whipt For following him henceforth
The white hand of a Lady Feauer thee
Shake thou to looke ont Get thee backe to Caesar
Tell him thy entertainment looke thou say
He makes me angry with him For he seemes
Proud and disdainfull harping on what I am
Not what he knew I was He makes me angry
And at this time most easie tis to doot
When my good Starres that were my former guides
Haue empty left their Orbes and shot their Fires
Into th Abisme of hell If he mislike
My speech and what is done tell him he has
Hiparchus my enfranched Bondman whom
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
As he shall like to quit me Vrge it thou
Hence with thy stripes be gone

 Cleo Ah Deere if I be so
From my cold heart let Heauen ingender haile
And poyson it in the sourse and the first stone
Drop in my necke as it determines so

Till by degrees the memory of my wombe
Together with my braue Egyptians all
By the discandering of this pelleted storme
Lye grauelesse till the Flies and Gnats of Nyle
Haue buried them for prey

 Ant I am satisfied
Caesar sets downe in Alexandria where
I will oppose his Fate Our force by Land
Hath Nobly held our seuerd Nauie too
Haue knit againe and Fleete threatning most Sealike

 Ant I will be trebblesinewed hearted breathd
And fight maliciously for when mine houres

Diseases in our Bodies I must perforce

Or looke on thine we could not stall together
In the whole world But yet let me lament
With teares as Soueraigne as the blood of hearts
That thou my Brother my Competitor
In top of all designe my Mate in Empire
Friend and Companion in the front of Warre
The Arme of mine owne Body and the Heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindle that our Starres
Vnreconciliable should diuide our equalnesse to this

Nor once be chasticd with the sober eye
Of dull Octauia Shall they hoyst me vp
And shew me to the showting Varlotarie
Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle graue vnto me rather on Nylus mudde
Lay me starkenakd and let the waterFlies
Blow me into abhorring rather make

 Dol Most Soueraigne Creature

 Cleo His legges bestrid the Ocean his reard arme
Crested the world His voyce was propertied
As all the tuned Spheres and that to Friends
But when he meant to quaile and shake the Orbe

There was no winter int An Anthony it was
That grew the more by reaping His delights
Were Dolphinlike they shewd his backe aboue
The Element they liud in In his Liuery
Walkd Crownes and Crownets Realms  Islands were
As plates dropt from his pocket

 Cleo Thinke you there was or might be such a man
As this I dreampt of
 Dol Gentle Madam no

 Cleo You Lye vp to the hearing of the Gods

To vie strange formes with fancie yet t imagine

Of my good purposes and put your children

To one so meeke that mine owne Seruant should
Parcell the summe of my disgraces by
Addition of his Enuy Say good Caesar
That I some Lady trifles haue reserud

but in the keeping of wise people for indeede there is
no goodnesse in the Worme

 Cleo Take thou no care it shall be heeded

 Clow Very good giue it nothing I pray you for it

 Cleo Will it eate me
 Clow You must not think I am so simple but I know
the diuell himselfe will not eate a woman I know that
a woman is a dish for the Gods if the diuell dresse her
not But truly these same whorson diuels doe the Gods
great harme in their women for in euery tenne that they
make the diuels marre fiue

 Cleo Well get thee gone farewell

 Clow Yes forsooth I wish you ioy oth worm

Exit

 Cleo Giue me my Robe put on my Crowne I haue
Immortall longings in me Now no more
The iuyce of Egypts Grape shall moyst this lip
Yare yare good Iras quicke Me thinkes I heare
Anthony call I see him rowse himselfe
To praise my Noble Act I heare him mock
The lucke of Caesar which the Gods giue men
To excuse their after wrath Husband I come
Now to that name my Courage proue my Title
I am Fire and Ayre my other Elements
I giue to baser life So haue you done
Come then and take the last warmth of my Lippes
Farewell kinde Charmian Iras long farewell
Haue I the Aspicke in my lippes Dost fall
If thou and Nature can so gently part
The stroke of death is as a Louers pinch
Which hurts and is desird Dost thou lye still
If thus thou vanishest thou tellst the world
It is not worth leauetaking

 Char Dissolue thicke clowd  Raine that I may say
The Gods themselues do weepe

 Cleo This proues me base
If she first meete the Curled Anthony
Heel make demand of her and spend that kisse
Which is my heauen to haue Come thou mortal wretch
With thy sharpe teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once vntye Poore venomous Foole
Be angry and dispatch Oh couldst thou speake
That I might heare thee call great Caesar Asse vnpolicied

 Char Oh Easterne Starre

 Cleo Peace peace
Dost thou not see my Baby at my breast
That suckes the Nurse asleepe

 Char O breake O breake
 Cleo As sweet as Balme as soft as Ayre as gentle
O Anthony Nay I will take thee too
What should I stay

Dyes

 Char In this wilde World So fare thee well
Now boast thee Death in thy possession lyes
A Lasse vnparalelld Downie Windowes cloze
And golden Phoebus neuer be beheld
Of eyes againe so Royall your Crownes away
Ile mend it and then play
Enter the Guard rustling in and Dolabella

 1Guard Wheres the Queene
 Char Speake softly wake her not

 1 Caesar hath sent
 Char Too slow a Messenger
Oh come apace dispatch I partly feele thee

 1 Approach hoa
Alls not well Caesars beguild

 2 Theres Dolabella sent from Caesar call him

 1 What worke is heere Charmian
Is this well done
 Char It is well done and fitting for a Princesse
Descended of so many Royall Kings
Ah Souldier

Charmian dyes

Enter Dolabella

 Dol How goes it heere
 2Guard All dead

 Dol Caesar thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this Thy selfe art comming
To see performd the dreaded Act which thou
So soughtst to hinder
Enter Caesar and all his Traine marching

 All A way there a way for Caesar

 Dol Oh sir you are too sure an Augurer
That you did feare is done

 Caesar Brauest at the last
She leuelld at our purposes and being Royall
Tooke her owne way the manner of their deaths
I do not see them bleede

 Dol Who was last with them
 1Guard A simple Countryman that broght hir Figs
This was his Basket

 Caesar Poysond then

 1Guard Oh Caesar
This Charmian liud but now she stood and spake
I found her trimming vp the Diadem
On her dead Mistris tremblingly she stood
And on the sodaine dropt

 Caesar Oh Noble weakenesse
If they had swallowd poyson twould appeare
By externall swelling but she lookes like sleepe
As she would catch another Anthony
In her strong toyle of Grace

 Dol Heere on her brest
There is a vent of Bloud and something blowne
The like is on her Arme

 1Guard This is an Aspickes traile
And these Figgeleaues haue slime vpon them such
As th Aspicke leaues vpon the Caues of Nyle

 Caesar Most probable
That so she dyed for her Physitian tels mee
She hath pursude Conclusions infinite
Of easie wayes to dye Take vp her bed
And beare her Women from the Monument
She shall be buried by her Anthony
No Graue vpon the earth shall clip in it
A payre so famous high euents as these
Strike those that make them and their Story is
No lesse in pitty then his Glory which
Brought them to be lamented Our Army shall
In solemne shew attend this Funerall
And then to Rome Come Dolabella see
High Order in this great Solemnity

Exeunt omnes

FINIS THE TRAGEDIE OF Anthonie and Cleopatra
