THE LAST STETSON

By John Fox Jr




I

A MIDSUMMER freshet was running over old Gabe Bunchs waterwheel into
the Cumberland Inside the mill Steve Marcum lay in one dark corner with
a slouched hat over his face The boy Isom was emptying a sack of corn
into the hopper Old Gabe was speaking his mind

Always the miller had been a man of peace and there was one time when
he thought the old StetsonLewallen feud was done That was when Rome
Stetson the last but one of his name and Jasper Lewallen the last
but one of his put their guns down and fought with bare fists on a high
ledge above old Gabes mill one morning at daybreak The man who was
beaten was to leave the mountains the other was to stay at home and
have peace Steve Marcum a Stetson heard the sworn terms and saw the
fight Jasper was fairly whipped and when Rome let him up he proved
treacherous and ran for his gun Rome ran too but stumbled and fell
Jasper whirled with his Winchester and was about to kill Rome where he
lay when a bullet came from somewhere and dropped him back to the ledge
again Both Steve Marcum and Rome Stetson said they had not fired the
shot neither would say who had Some thought one man was lying some
thought the other was and Jaspers death lay between the two State
troops came then under the Governors order from the Blue Grass and
Rome had to drift down the river one night in old Gabes canoe and on
Out of the mountains for good Martha Lewallen who though Jaspers
sister and the last of the name loved and believed Rome went with
him Marcums and Braytons who had taken sides in the fight hid in the
bushes around Hazlan or climbed over into Virginia A railroad started
up the Cumberland Furriners came in to buy wild lands and get out
timber Civilization began to press over the mountains and down on
Hazlan as it had pressed in on Breathitt the seat of another feud
in another county In Breathitt the feud was long past and with good
reason old Gabe thought that it was done in Hazlan

But that autumn a panic started over from England It stopped the
railroad far down the Cumberland it sent the furriners home and
drove civilization back Marcums and Braytons came in from hiding and
drifted one by one to the old fightingground In time they took up the
old quarrel and with Steve Marcum and Steve Brayton as leaders the
old StetsonLewallen feud went on though but one soul was left in the
mountains of either name That was Isom a pale little fellow whom Rome
had left in old Gabes care and he though a Stetson and a halfbrother
to Rome was not counted because he was only a boy and a foundling and
because his ways were queer

There was no open rupture no organized divisionthat might happen no
more The mischief was individual now and ambushing was more common
Certain men were looking for each other and it was a question of
drawin quick n shootin quick when the two met by accident or of
getting the advantage from the bresh

In time Steve Marcum had come face to face with old Steve Brayton in
Hazlan and the two Steves as they were known drew promptly Marcum
was in the dust when the smoke cleared away and now after three months
in bed he was just out again He had come down to the mill to see Isom
This was the millers first chance for remonstrance and as usual
he began to lay it down that every man who had taken a human life must
sooner or later pay for it with his own It was an old story to Isom
and with a shake of impatience he turned out the door of the mill and
left old Gabe droning on under his dusty hat to Steve who being heavy
with moonshine dropped asleep

Outside the sun was warm the flood was calling from the dam and the
boys petulance was gone at once For a moment he stood on the rude
platform watching the tide then he let one bare foot into the water
and with a shiver of delight dropped from the boards In a moment his
clothes were on the ground behind a laurel thicket and his slim white
body was flashing like a faun through the reeds and bushes up stream
A hundred yards away the creek made a great loop about a wet thicket
of pine and rhododendron and he turned across the bushy neck Creeping
through the gnarled bodies of rhododendron he dropped suddenly behind
the pine and lay flat in the black earth Ten yards through the
dusk before him was the halfbent figure of a man letting an old army
haversack slip from one shoulder and Isom watched him hide it with
a rifle under a bush and go noiselessly on towards the road It was
Crump Eli Crump who had been a spy for the Lewallens in the old feud
and who was spying now for old Steve Brayton It was the second time
Isom had seen him lurking about and the boys impulse was to hurry back
to the mill But it was still peace and without his gun Crump was not
dangerous so Isom rose and ran on and splashing into the angry little
stream shot away like a roll of birch bark through the tawny crest of
a big wave He had done the feat a hundred times he knew every rock and
eddy in floodtime and he floated through them and slipped like an eel
into the millpond Old Gabe was waiting for him

Whut ye mean boy he said sharply reskin the fever an ager this
way No wonder folks thinks ye air half crazy Git inter them clothes
now n come in hyeh Youll ketch yer death o cold swimmin this way
atter a fresh

The boy was shivering when he took his seat at the funnel but he did
not mind that some day he meant to swim over that dam Steve still lay
motionless in the corner near him and Isom lifted the slouched hat
and began tickling his lips with a straw Steve was beyond the point of
tickling and Isom dropped the hat back and turned to tell the miller
what he had seen in the thicket The dim interior darkened just then
and Crump stood in the door Old Gabe stared hard at him without a word
of welcome but Crump shuffled to a chair unasked and sat like a toad
astride it with his knees close up under his arms and his wizened face
in his hands

Meeting Isoms angry glance he shifted his own uneasily

Seed the new preacher comm long today he asked Drawing one dirty
finger across his forehead Got a long scar cross hyeh

The miller shook his head

Well hes acomm Ive been waitin fer him up the road but I reckon
I got to git cross the river purty soon now

Crump had been living over in Breathitt since the old feud He had been
convicted over there by Sherd Raines a preacher from the Jellico
Hills and he had grown pious Indeed he had been trailing after Raines
from place to place and he was following the circuitrider now to the
scene of his own deviltryHazlan

Reckon you folks dont know I got the cirkitrider to come over hyeh
do ye he went on Ef he cant preach Well Id tell a man He kin
jus draw the heart outn a holler log He convicted me fust night
over thar in Breathitt He come up thar ye know to stop the feud he
said n thar was laughin from one eendo Breathitt to tother but
thar was the whoppinest crowd thar I ever see when he did come The
meetinhouse wasnt big enough to hold em so he goes out on the
aidge o town n climbs on to a stump He hed a woman with him from the
settlemintsshes awaitin at Hazlan fer him nown she had a curus
little box n he put her n the box on a big rock n started in a
callin em his bretherin n sisteren n folks seed mighty soon
thet he meant it too Hes always mighty easylike tell he gits to the
bloodpenalty

At the word Crumps listeners paid sudden heed Old Gabes knife
stopped short in the heart of the stick he was whittling the boy looked
sharply up from the running meal into Crumps face and sat still

Well he jes prayed to the Almighty as though he was atalkin to him
face to face n then the woman put her hands on that box n the
sweetes sound anybody thar ever heerd come outen it Then she got to
singin Hit wusnt nuthin anybody thard ever heerd but some o the
women folks was a snifflin fore she got through He pitched right into
the feud as he calls hit n the sin o sheddin human blood I tell
ye n twixt him and the soldiers I reckon thar wont be no more
fightin in Breathitt He says n he always says it mighty loud
Crump raised his own voicethet the man as kills his fellercritter
hev some day got ter give up his own blood sartin n shore

It was old Gabes pet theory and he was nodding approval The boys
parted lips shook with a spasm of fear and were as quickly shut tight
with suspicion Steve raised his head as though he too had heard the
voice and looked stupidly about him

I tol him Crump went on thet things was already agettin kind o
frolicsome round hyeh agin thet the Marcums n Braytons was atakin
up the ole war n would be aplunkin one nother every time they got
together n agittin the whole country in fear n tremblinnow
thet Steve Marcum had come back

Steve began to scowl and a vixenish smile hovered at Isoms lips

He knows mighty wellfer I tol himthet thar haint a wuss man in all
these mountains than thet very Steve The name ended in a gasp and the
wizened gossip was caught by the throat and tossed chair and all into
a corner of the mill

None o that Steve called the miller sternly Not hyeh Dont hurt
him now

Crumps face stiffened with such terror that Steve broke into a laugh

Well ye air a skeery critter he said contemptuously I haint
goin to hurt him Uncl Gabe but he must be a plumb idgit atalkin
bout folks to thar face n him so puny an spindlin You git

Crump picked himself up tremblingDont ye ever let me see ye on this
side o the river agin now and shuffled out giving Marcum one look
of fear and unearthly hate

Convicted snorted Steve I heerd old Steve Brayton had hired him to
waylay me n I swar I believe hits so

Well he wont hev to give him moren a chaw o tobaccer now said
Gabe Hell come purty near doin hit hisseif I reckon ef he gits
the chance

Well he kin git the chance ef I gits my leetle account settled with ole
Steve Brayton fust Pears like that old hog aint satisfied shootin
me hisself Stretching his arms with a yawn Steve winked at Isom and
moved to the door The boy followed him outside

Were goin fer ole Brayton about the dark o the next moon boy he
said Hes sort o spicious now n well give him a leetle time to
git tame Ill have a brannew Winchester fer ye Isom Hit ull be like
ole times agin when Rome was hyeh Whuts the matter boy he asked
suddenly Isom looked unresponsive listless

Air ye gittin sick agin

Well I haint feelin much peert Steve

Take keer o yourself boy Dont git sick now Well have to watch Eli
Crump purty close I dont know why I haint killed thet spyin skunk
long ago ceptin I never had a shore an sartin reason fer doin it

Isom started to speak then and stopped He would learn more first and
he let Steve go on home unwarned

The two kept silence after Marcum had gone Isom turned away from old
Gabe and stretched himself out on the platform He looked troubled The
miller too was worried

Jus a hole in the groun he said half to himself thats whut were
all comm to Pears like we mought help one nother to keep outn hit
stid o holpin em in

Brown shadows were interlacing out in the millpond where old Gabes
eyes were intent A current of cool air had started down the creek to
the river A katydid began to chant Twilight was coming and the miller
rose

Hits a comfort to know you wont be mixed up in all this devilment
he said and then as though he had found more light in the gloom
Hits a comfort to know the new rider air shorely apreachin the right
doctrine n I want ye to go hear him Blood for bloodlife fer a life
Your grandad shot ole Tom Lewallen in Hazlan Ole Jack Lewallen shot him
from the bresh Tom Stetson killed ole Jack ole Jass killed Tom n so
hit comes down fer back as I can ricollect I hev nuver knowed hit to
fail The lad had risen on one elbow His face was pale and uneasy and
he averted it when the miller turned in the door

Youd better stay hyeh son n finish up the grist Hit wont take
long Hev ye got victuals fer yer supper

Isom nodded without looking around and when old Gabe was gone he rose
nervously and dropped helplessly back to the floor

Pears like old Gabe knows I killed Jass he breathed sullenly
Pears like all of em knows hit n air jus atormentin me

Nobody dreamed that the boy and his old gun had ended that fight on the
cliff and without knowing it old Gabe kept the lad in constant torture
with his talk of the bloodpenalty But Isom got used to it in time
for he had shot to save his brothers life Steve Marcum treated him
thereafter as an equal Steves friends too changed in manner towards
him because Steve had And now just when he had reached the point of
wondering whether after all there might not be one thing that old Gabe
did not know Crump had come along with the millers story which he had
got from still another a circuitrider who must know the truth The
fact gave him trouble

Mebbe hits goin to happen when I goes with Steve atter ole Brayton
he mumbled and he sat thinking the matter over until a rattle and a
whir inside the mill told him that the hopper was empty He arose to
fill it and coming out again he heard hoofbeats on the dirt road A
stranger rode around the rhododendrons and shouted to him asking the
distance to Hazlan He took off his hat when Isom answered to wipe the
dust and perspiration from his face and the boy saw a white scar across
his forehead A little awestricken the lad walked towards him

Air you the new rider whuts goin to preach up to Hazlan he asked

Raines smiled at the solemnity of the little fellow Yes he said
kindly Wont you come up and hear me

Yes sir he said and his lips parted as though he wanted to say
something else but Raines did not notice

I wished I had axed him he said watching the preacher ride away
Uncle Gabe knows might nigh everthing n he says so Crump said
the rider said so but Crump might a been lyin He most alays is I
wished I had axed him

Mechanically the lad walked along the millrace which was made of hewn
boards and hollow logs In every crevice grass hung in thick bunches to
the ground or tipped wiry blades over the running water Tightening
a prop where some silvery jet was getting too large he lifted the
tailgate a trifle and lay down again on the platform near the old
wheel Out in the millpond the water would break now and then into
ripples about some unwary moth and the white belly of a fish would
flash from the surface It was the only sharp accent on the air The
chant of the katydids had become a chorus and the hush of darkness
was settling over the steady flow of water and the low drone of the
millstones

I haint afeerd he kept saying to himself I haint afeerd o
nothin nor nobody but he lay brooding until his head throbbed until
darkness filled the narrow gorge and the strip of dark blue up through
the trees was pointed with faint stars He was troubled when he rose
and climbed on Romes horse and rode homewardso troubled that he
turned finally and started back in a gallop for Hazlan

It was almost as Crump had said There was no church in Hazlan and as
in Breathitt the people had to follow Raines outside the town and he
preached from the roadside The riders Master never had a tabernacle
more simple overhead the stars and a low moon close about the trees
still and heavy with summer a pine torch over his head like a yellow
plume two tallow dips hung to a beech on one side and flicking to the
other the shadows of the people who sat under them A few Marcums and
Braytons were there one faction shadowed on Rainess right one on
his left Between them the rider stood straight and prayed as though
talking with some one among the stars Behind him the voice of the woman
at her tiny organ rose among the leaves And then he spoke as he had
prayed and from the first they listened like children while in their
own homely speech he went on to tell them just as he would have told
children a story that some of them had never heard before Forgive
your enemies as He had forgiven his that was his plea Marcums and
Braytons began to press in from the darkness on each side forgetting
each other as the rest of the people forgot them And when the story
was quite done Raines stood a full minute without a word No one was
prepared for what followed Abruptly his voice rose sternlyThou
shalt not kill and then Satan took shape under the torch The man was
transformed swaying half crouched before them The long black hair fell
across the white scar and picture after picture leaped from his tongue
with such vividness that a low wail started through the audience and
women sobbed in their bonnets It was penalty for bloodshednot in this
world penalty eternal in the next and one slight figure under the dips
staggered suddenly aside into the darkness

It was Isom and no soul possessed of devils was ever more torn than
his when he splashed through Troubled Fork and rode away that night
Half a mile on he tried to keep his eyes on his horses neck anywhere
except on one high gray rock to which they were raised against his
willthe peak under which he had killed young Jasper There it was
staring into the moon but watching him as he fled through the woods
shuddering at shadows dodging branches that caught at him as he passed
and on in a run until he drew rein and slipped from his saddle at the
friendly old mill There was no terror for him there There every bush
was a friend every beech trunk a sentinel on guard for him in shining
armor

It was the old struggle that he was starting through that nightthe old
fight of humanity from savage to Christian and the lad fought it until
with the birth of his wavering soul the premonitions of the first dawn
came on The patches of moonlight shifted paling The beech columns
mottled slowly with gray and brown A ruddy streak was cleaving the east
like a slow sword of fire The chill air began to pulse and the mists to
stir Moisture had gathered on the boys sleeve His horse was stamping
uneasily and the lad rose stiffly his face gray but calm and started
home At old Gabes gate he turned in his saddle to look where under
the last sinking star was once the home of his old enemies Farther
down under the crest was old Steve Brayton alive and at that moment
perhaps asleep

Forgive your enemies that was the riders plea Forgive old Steve
who had mocked him and had driven Rome from the mountains who had
threatened old Gabes life and had shot Steve Marcum almost to death
The lad drew breath quickly and standing in his stirrups stretched out
his fist and let it drop slowly




II

OLD Gabe was just starting out when Isom reached the cabin and the old
man thought the boy had been at the mill all night Isom slept through
the day and spoke hardly a word when the miller came home though the
latter had much to say of Raines the two Steves and of the trouble
possible He gave some excuse for not going with old Gabe the next day
and instead went into the woods alone

Late in the middle of the afternoon he reached the mill Old Gabe sat
smoking outside the door and Isom stretched himself out on the platform
close to the water shading his eyes from the rich sunlight with one
ragged sleeve

Uncl Gabe he said suddenly sposin Steve Brayton was to step
outn the bushes thar some mawnin n pull down his Winchester on ye
would ye say Lawd fergive him fer he dont know whut he do

Old Gabe had told him once about a Stetson and a Lewallen who were heard
half a mile away praying while they fought each other to death with
Winchesters There was no use prayin an shootin the miller
declared There was but one way for them to escape damnation that was
to throw down their guns and make friends But the miller had forgotten
and his mood that morning was whimsical

Well I mought Isom he said ef I didnt happen to have a gun
handy

The humor was lost on Isom His chin was moving up and down and his
face was serious That was just it He could forgive JassJass was dead
he could forgive Crump if he caught him in no devilment old Brayton
evenafter Steves revenge was done But nowThe boy rose shaking his
head

Uncl Gabe he said with sudden passion whut ye reckon Romes
adoin

The miller looked a little petulant Dont ye git tired axin me thet
question Isom Romes ascratchin right peert fer a livin I reckon
fer hisself n Marthy Yes n mebbe fer a young un too by this time
Ef ye air honin fer Rome why dont ye rack out n go to him Lawd
knows Id hate ter see ye go but I tol Rome Id let ye whenever ye got
ready n so I will

Isom had no answer and old Gabe was puzzled It was always this way
The boy longed for Rome the miller could see He spoke of him sometimes
with tears and sometimes he seemed to be on the point of going to him
but he shrank inexplicably when the time for leaving came

Isom started into the mill now without a word as usual Old Gabe
noticed that his feet were unsteady and with quick remorse began to
question him

Kinder puny haint ye Isom

Well I haint feelin much peert

Hit was mighty keerless old Gabe said with kindly reproach
swimmin the crick atter a fresh

Hit wasnt the swimmin he protested dropping weakly at the
threshold Hit was settin out n the woods I was in Hazlan tother
night Und Gabe to hear the new rider

The miller looked around with quick interest Ive been skeered afore
by riders atellin bout the torments o hell but I never heerd
nothin like his tellin bout the Lord He said the Lord was jes as
pore as anybody thar and lived jes as rough thet He made fences and
barns n oxyokes n sech like an He couldnt write His own name when
He started out to save the worl an when he come to the pint whar His
enemies tuk hol of Him the rider jes crossed his fingers up over his
head n axed us if we didnt know how it hurt to run a splinter into
a fellers hand when hes loggin or a thorn into yer foot when yere
goin barefooted

Hit jes made me sick Uncl Gabe hearin him tell how they stretched
Him out on a cross o wood when Hed come down fer nothin but to save
em n stuck a spear big as a conknife into His side n give Him
vinegar n let Him hang thar n die with His own mammy astandin
down on the groun acryin n watchin Him Some folks thar never
heerd sech afore The women was arockin n ole Granny Day axed right
out ef thet tuk place a long time ago n the rider said Yes a long
time ago mos two thousand years Granny was acryin Uncl Gabe n
she said sorter soft Stranger lets hope that hit haint so n
the rider says But hit air so n He fergive em while they was doin
it Thets whut got me Uncl Gabe n when the woman got to singin
somethin kinder broke loose hyehIsom passed his hand over his thin
chestn I couldnt git breath I was mos afeerd to ride home I jes
layed at the mill studyin till I thought my head would bust I reckon
hit was the spent aworkin me Looks like I was mos convicted Uncl
Gabe His voice trembled and he stopped Crump was alyin he cried
suddenly But hits wuss Und Gabe hits wuss You say a life fer a
life in this worl the rider says hits in the next n Im misble
Uncl Gabe Ef RomeI wish Rome was hyeh he cried helplessly I
dont know whut to do

The miller rose and limped within the mill and ran one hand through
the shifting corn He stood in the doorway looking long and perplexedly
towards Hazlan he finally saw he thought just what the lads trouble
was He could give him some comfort and he got his chair and dragged it
out to the door across the platform and sat down in silence

Isom he said at last the Spent air shorely aworkin ye n Im
glad of it But ye mus n t worry about the penalty afallin on Rome
Steve Marcum killed Jasshe cant fool men Ive told Steve hes got
thet penalty to pay ef he gits up this trouble Im glad the Spents
aworkin ye but ye musn t worry bout Rome

Isom rose suddenly on one elbow and with a moan lay back and crossed
his arms over his face

Old Gabe turned and left him

Git up Isom It was the millers voice again an hour later You
better go home now Ride the hoss boy he and kindly

Isom rose and old Gabe helped him mount and stood at the door The
horse started but the boy pulled him to a standstill again

I want to ax ye jes one thing more Uncl Gabe he said slowly
Sposin Steve had akilled Jass to keep him from killin Rome hev he
got to be damned fer it jes the same Hev he got to give up eternal life
anyways Haint thar no way outn itno way

There was need for close distinction now and the miller was deliberate

Ef Steve shot Jass he said jes to save Romes lifehe had the right
to shoot him Thar haint no doubt bout that The law says so
Butthere was a judicial pauseIve heerd Steve say that he hated Jass
wuss n anybody on earth cept old Brayton n ef he wus glad o the
chance o killin him whythe Lord air merciful Isom the Bible air
true n hit says an eye fer an eye a tooth fer a tooth n I never
knowed hit to failbut the Lord air merciful Ef Steve would only jes
repent n ef stid o fightin the Lord by takin human life hed
fight fer Him by savin it I reckon the Lord would fergive him Fer
ef ye lose yer life fer Him He do say youll find it agin
somewharsometime

Old Gabe did not see the sullen despair that came into the boys tense
face The subtlety of the answer had taken the old man back to the days
when he was magistrate and his eyes were half closed Isom rode away
without a word From the dark of the mill old Gabe turned to look after
him again

Im afeerd hes agittin feverish agin Hit looks like hes convicted
buthe knew the wavering nature of the boyI dont knowI dont
know

Going home an hour later the old man saw several mountaineers climbing
the path towards Steve Marcums cabin it meant the brewing of mischief
and when he stopped at his own gate he saw at the bend of the road a
figure creep from the bushes on one side into the bushes on the other

It looked like Crump




III

IT was Crump and fifty yards behind him was Isom slipping through the
brush after himIsoms evil spiritold Gabe Raines conviction
bloodpenalty forgotten all lost in the passion of a chase which has
no parallel when the game is man

Straight up the ravine Crump went along a path which led to Steve
Marcums cabin There was a clump of rhododendron at the head of the
ravine and near Steves cabin About this hour Marcum would be chopping
wood for supper or sitting out in his porch in easy range from the
thicket Crumps plan was plain he was about his revenge early and
Isom was exultant

Oh no Eli you wont git Steve this time Oh naw

The bushes were soon so thick that he could no longer follow Crump by
sight and every few yards he had to stop to listen and then steal on
like a mountaincat towards the leaves rustling ahead of him Halfway
up the ravine Crump turned to the right and stopped Puzzled Isom
pushed so close that the spy standing irresolute on the edge of
the path whirled around The boy sank to his face and in a moment
footsteps started and grew faint Crump had darted across the path and
was running through the undergrowth up the spur Isom rose and hurried
after him and when panting hard he reached the top the spys
skulking figure was sliding from Steves house and towards the Breathitt
road and with a hot puzzled face the boy went down after it

On a little knob just over a sudden turn in the road Crump stopped and
looking sharply about him laid his gun down Just in front of him were
two rocks waisthigh with a crevice between them Drawing a long knife
from his pocket he climbed upon them and began to cut carefully away
the spreading top of a bush that grew on the other side Isom crawled
down towards him like a lizard from tree to tree A moment later the
spy was filling up the crevice with stones and Isom knew what he was
about he was making a blind to waylay Steve who the boy knew was
going to Breathitt by that road the next Sunday How did Crump know
thathow did he know everything The crevice filled Crump cut branches
and stuck them between the rocks Then he pushed his rifle through the
twigs and taking aim several times withdrew it When he turned away
at last and started down to the road he looked back once more and Isom
saw him grinning Almost chuckling in answer the lad slipped around the
knob to the road the other way and Crump threw up his gun with a gasp
of fright when a figure rose out of the dusk before him

Hol on Eli said Isom easily Dont git skeered Hits nobody but
me Whar ye been

Crump laughed so quick was he disarmed of suspicion Jes up the river
a piece to see Aunt Sally Day Shes a fust cousin o mine by marriage

Jsoms right hand was slipping back as if to rest on his hip Dyou say
youd been convicted Eli

Crumps answer was chantlike Yes Lawd reckon I have

Goin to stop all o yer lyin air ye Isom went on in the same
tone and Crump twitched as though struck suddenly from behind an
stealin n laywayin

Look ahyeh boy he began roughly and mumbling a threat started
on

Uh Eli Even then the easy voice fooled him again and he turned
Isom had a big revolver on a line with his breast Drap yer gun he
said tremulously

Crump tried to laugh but his guilty face turned gray Take keer boy
he gasped yer guns cocked Take keer I tell ye

Drap it damn ye Isom called in sudden fury n git clean away from
it Crump backed and Isom came forward and stood with one foot on the
fallen Winchester

I seed ye Eli Been makin a blind fer Steve hev ye Goin to shoot
him in the back too air ye Youre ketched at last Eli Youve done
a heap o devilment Youre gittin wuss all the time You oughter be
dead n now

Crump found voice in a cry of terror and a whine for mercy The boy
looked at him unable to speak his contempt

Git down thar he said finally and Crump knowing what was wanted
stretched himself in the road Isom sat down on a stone the big pistol
across one knee

Roll over Crump rolled at full length

Git up Isom laughed wickedly Ye dont look purty Eli He lifted
the pistol and nipped a cake of dirt from the road between Crumps feet
With another cry of fear the spy began a vigorous dance

Hol on Eli I dont want ye to dance Ye belong to the chuch now
n I wouldnt have ye go agin yer religion fer nothin Stan still
Another bullet and another cut between Crumps feet Pears like ye
dont think I kin shoot straight Eli he went on reloading the empty
chambers some folks think Im a idgit n I know em Do you think
Im a idgit Eli

Actin mighty nateral now Isom was raising the pistol again Oh
Lawdy Dont shoot boydont shoot

Git down on yer knees Now I want ye to beg fer mercy thet ye never
showedthet ye wouldnt a showed Steve Purty good he said
encouragingly

Mebbe ye kin pray a leetle seem ez ye air a chuch member Pray fer
yer enemies Eli Uncl Gabe says ye must love yer enemies I know how
ye loves me n I want yer to pray fer me The Lawd mus sot a powerful
store by a good citizen like you Ax him to fergive me fer killin ye

Have mercy O Lawd prayed Crump to commandand the prayer was
subtleon the murderer of this Thy servant A life fer a life Thou
hev said O Lawd Fer killin me he will foller me n ef Ye hev not
mussy he is boun fer the lowes pit o hell O Lawd

It was Isoms time to wince now and Crumps pious groan was cut short

Shet up cried the boy sharply and he sat a moment silent Youve
been aspyin on us sence I was borned Eli he said reflectively

I believe ye laywayed dad Yu spied on Rome Yu told the soldiers
whar he was ahidin Yu tried to shoot him from the bresh Yu found
out Steve was goin to Breathitt on Sunday n youve jes made a blind
to shoot him in the back I reckon thars no meanness ye haint done
Dads alays said ye sot a snare fer a woman oncea woman Yu loaded a
musket with slugs n tied a string to the trigger n stretched hit
cross the path n yu got up on a cliff n whistled to make her slow
up jes when she struck the string I reckon thets yer wustbut I dont
know

Several times Crump raised his hands in protest while his arraignment
was going on several times he tried to speak but his lips refused
utterance The boys voice was getting thicker and thicker and he was
nervously working the cock of the big pistol up and down

Git up he said and Crump rose with a spring The lads tone meant
release

You haint wuth the risk I haint goin ter kill ye I jus wanted
ter banter ye n make ye beg Youre a good beggar Eli n a powerful
prayer Youll be a shinin light in the chuch ef ye gits a chance ter
shine long Fer lemme tell ye nobody ever ketched ye afore But youre
ketched now an Im goin to tell Steve Hell be awatchin fer ye
n so ll I I tell ye in time ef ye ever come over hyeh agin as long
as you live youll never git back alive Turn roun Hev ye got any
balls he asked feeling in Crumps pockets for cartridges No
wellhe picked up the Winchester and pumped the magazine emptyIll
keep these he said handing Crump the empty rifle Now git awayan
git away quick

Crumps slouching footsteps went out of hearing and Isom sat where he
was His elbows dropped to his knees His face dropped slowly into his
hands and the nettles of remorse began to sting He took the back of
one tremulous hand presently to wipe the perspiration from his forehead
and he found it burning A sharp pain shot through his eyes He knew
what that meant and feeling dizzy he rose and started a little blindly
towards home

Old Gabe was waiting for him He did not answer the old mans querulous
inquiry but stumbled towards a bed An hour later when the miller was
rubbing his forehead he opened his eyes shut them and began to talk

I reckon I haint much better n Eli Und Gabe he said plaintively
Ive been abusin him down thar in the woods I come might nigh
killin him onct The old man stroked on scarcely heeding the boys
words so much nonsense would he talk when ill

Ive been lyin to ye Uncl Gabe n adeceivin of ye right along
Steves agoin atter ole BraytonIm goin tooSteve didnt kill
Jasshit wusnt Stevehit wusnt Romehit was The last word stopped
behind his shaking lips he rose suddenly in bed looked wildly into the
millers startled face and dropping with a sob to the bed went sobbing
to sleep

Old Gabe went back to his pipe and while he smoked his figure shrank
slowly in his chair He went to bed finally but sleep would not come
and he rose again and built up the fire and sat by it waiting for day
His own doctrine sternly taught for many a year had come home to him
and the millers face when he opened his door was gray as the breaking
light




IV

THERE was little peace for old Gabe that day at the mill And when he
went home at night he found cause for the thousand premonitions that had
haunted him The lad was gone

A faint light in the east was heralding the moon when Isom reached Steve
Marcums gate There were several horses hitched to the fence several
dim forms seated in the porch and the lad halloed for Steve whose
shadow shot instantly from the door and came towards him

Glad ter see ye Isom he called jubilantly I was jus about to sen
fer ye Howd ye happen to come up

Isom answered in a low voice with the news of Crumps blind and Steve
laughed and swore in the same breath

Come hyeh he said leading the way back and at the porch he had Isom
tell the story again

Whut d I tell ye boys he asked triumphantly Dont believe ye
more n half believed me

Three more horsemen rode up to the gate and came into the light Every
man was armed and at Isoms puzzled look Steve caught the lad by the
arm and led him around the chimneycorner He was in high spirits

Pears like ole times Isom Im agoin fer thet cussed ole Steve
Brayton this very night Hes behind Crump I spicioned it afore now
I know it for sartain Hes agoin to give Eli a mule n a Winchester
fer killin me Were goin to sprise him tonight He wont be
lookin fer usIve fixed that I wus jus about to sen fer ye I
haint fergot how ye kin handle a gun Steve laughed significantly
Yere a good frien o mine n Im goin to show ye thet Im a frien
o yourn

Isoms paleness was unnoticed in the dark The old throbbing began to
beat again at his temple the old haze started from his eyes

Hyehs yer gun Isom he heard Steve saying next The fire was blazing
into his face At the chimneycorner was the bent figure of old Daddy
Marcum and across his lap shone a Winchester Steve was pointing at it
his grim face radiant the old mans toothless mouth was grinning and
his sharp black eyes were snapping up at him

Hits yourn I tell ye said Steve again I aimed jes to lend it
to ye but yeve saved me frum gittin killed mebbe n hits yourn
nowyourn boy fer keeps

Steve was holding the gun out to him now The smooth cold touch of the
polished barrel thrilled him It made everything for an instant clear
again and feeling weak Isom sat down on the bed gripping the treasure
in both trembling hands On one side of him some one was repeating
Steves plan of attack Old Braytons cabin was nearly opposite but
they would go up the river cross above the mill and ride back The
night was cloudy but they would have the moonlight now and then for the
climb up the mountain They would creep close and when the moon was hid
they would run in and get old Brayton alive if possible Thenthe rest
was with Steve

Across the room he could hear Steve telling the three newcomers with
an occasional curse about Crumps blind and how he knew that old
Brayton was hiring Crump

Old Steves meaner n Eli he said to himself and a flame of the old
hate surged up from the fire of temptation in his heart Steve Marcum
was his best friend Steve had shielded him The boy had promised to
join him against old Brayton and here was the Winchester brandnew to
bind his word

Git ready boys git ready

It was Steves voice and in Isoms ears the preachers voice rang after
it Again that blinding mist before his eyes and the boy brushed at
it irritably He could see the men buckling cartridgebelts but he sat
still Two or three men were going out Daddy Marcum was leaning on a
chair at the door looking eagerly at each man as he passed

Haint ye goin Isom

Somebody was standing before him twirling a rifle on its butt a boy
near Isoms age The whirling gun made him dizzy

Stop it he cried angrily Old Daddy Marcum was answering the boys
question from the door

Isom goin he piped proudly I reckon he air Whars yer belt boy
Git ready Git ready

Isom rose thenhe could not answer sitting downand caught at a bedpost
with one hand while he fumbled at his throat with the other

I haint goin

Steve heard at the door and whirled around Daddy Marcum was tottering
across the floor with one bony hand uplifted

Youre a coward The name stilled every sound Isom with eyes afire
sprang at the old man to strike but somebody caught his arm and forced
him back to the bed

Shet up dad said Steve angrily looking sharply into Isoms face
Dont ye see the boys sick He neednt go ef he dont want to Time to
start boys

The tramp of heavy boots started across the puncheon floor and porch
again Isom could hear Steves orders outside the laughs and jeers and
curses of the men as they mounted their horses he heard the cavalcade
pass through the gate the old mans cackling goodby then the horses
hoofs going down the mountain and Daddy Marcums hobbling step on the
porch again He was standing in the middle of the floor full in the
firelight when the old man reached the thresholdstanding in a trance
with a cartridgebelt in his hand

Good fer you Isom

The cry was apologetic and stopped short

The critters fersakcn he quavered and cowed by the boys strange
look the old man shrank away from him along the wall But Isom seemed
neither to see nor hear He caught up his rifle and wavering an
instant tossed it with the belt on the bed and ran out the door The
old man followed dumb with amazement

Isom he called getting his wits and his tongue at last Hyehs yer
gun Come back I tell ye Youve fergot yer gun Isom Isom

The voice piped shrilly out into the darkness and piped back without
answer

A steep path dangerous even by day ran snakelike from the cabin down
to the waters edge It was called Isoms path after that tragic night
No mountaineer went down it thereafter without a firm faith that only by
the direct help of Heaven could the boy in his flight down through the
dark have reached the river and the other side alive The path dropped
from ledge to ledge and ran the brink of precipices and chasms In a
dozen places the boy crashed through the undergrowth from one slippery
fold to the next below catching at roots and stones slipping past
death a score of times and dropping on till a flood of yellow light
lashed the gloom before him Just there the river was most narrow the
nose of a cliff swerved the current sharply across and on the other
side an eddy ran from it up stream These earthly helps he had and he
needed them

There had been a rainstorm and the waves swept him away like
thistledown and beat back at him as he fought through them and stood
choked and panting on the other shore He did not dare stop to rest
The Marcums too had crossed the river up at the ford by this time and
were galloping towards him and Isom started on and up When he reached
the first bench of the spur the moon was swinging over Thunderstruck
Knob The clouds broke as he climbed strips of radiant sky showed
between the rolling masses and the mountain above was light and dark
in quick succession He had no breath when he reached the ledge that ran
below old Steves cabin and flinging one arm above it he fell through
sheer exhaustion The cabin was dark as the clump of firs behind it
the inmates were unsuspecting and Steve Marcum and his men were not
far below A rumbling started under him while he lay there and grew
faintthe rumble of a stone knocked from the path by a horses hoof
Isom tried to halbo but his voice stopped in a whisper and he
painfully drew himself upon the rock upright under the bright moon
A quick oath of warning came thenit was Crumps shrill voice in the
Brayton cabinand Isom stumbled forward with both hands thrown up and
a gasping cry at his lips One flash came through a porthole of the
cabin A yell broke on the nightCrumps cry againand the boy swayed
across the rock and falling at the brink dropped with a limp struggle
out of sight




V

THE news of Isoms fate reached the miller by way of Hazlan before the
next noon Several men in the Brayton cabin had recognized the boy in
the moonlight At daybreak they found bloodstains on the ledge and on a
narrow shelf a few feet farther down Isom had slipped from one to the
other they said and in his last struggle had rolled over into Dead
Creek and had been swept into the Cumberland

It was Crump who had warned the Braytons Nobody ever knew how he had
learned Steve Marcums purpose And old Brayton on his guard and in his
own cabin was impregnable So the Marcums after a harmless fusillade
had turned back cursing Mocking shouts followed after them
pistolshots even the scraping of a fiddle and shuffling on the ledge
But they kept on cursing across the river and back to Daddy Marcum
who was standing in the porch peering for them through the dawn with a
story to tell about Isom

The critter was teched in the head the old man said and this was
what the Braytons too believed But Steve Marcum going to search for
Isoms body next day gave old Gabe another theory He told the miller
how Daddy Marcum had called Isom a coward and Steve said the boy had
gone ahead to prove he was no coward

He had mighty leetle call to prove it to me Think o his takin ole
Brayton all by hisself he said with a look at the yellow heaving
Cumberland N Lord think o his swimmin that river in the dark

Old Gabe asked a question fiercely then and demanded the truth and
Steve told him about the handtohand fight on the mountainside about
young Jaspers treachery and how the boy who was watching the fight
fired just in time to save Rome It made all plain at lastRomes and
Steves denials Isoms dinning on that one theme and why the boy
could not go to Rome and face Martha with her own blood on his hands
Isoms true motive too was plain and the miller told it brokenly to
Steve who rode away with a low whistle to tell it broadcast and left
the old man rocking his body like a woman

An hour later he rode back at a gallop to tell old Gabe to search the
river bank below the mill He did not believe Isom dead It was just his
feelin he said and one fact that nobody else thought importantthe
Brayton canoe was gone

Ef he was jus scamped by a ball said Steve you kin bet he tuk the
boat n hes down thar in the bushes somewhar now waitin fer dark

And about dusk sure enough old Gabe wandering hopefully through the
thicket below the mill stumbled over the canoe stranded in the bushes
In the new mud were the tracks of a boys bare feet leading into the
thicket and the miller made straight for home When he opened his door
he began to shake as if with palsy A figure was seated on the hearth
against the chimney and the firelight was playing over the face and
hair The lips were parted and the head hung limply to the breast The
clothes were torn to rags and one shoulder was bare Through the upper
flesh of it and close to the neck was an ugly burrow clotted with blood
The boy was asleep

Three nights later in Hazlan Sherd Raines told the people of Isoms
flight down the mountain across the river and up the steep to save his
life by losing it Before he was done one grayheaded figure pressed
from the darkness on one side and stood trembling under the dips It was
old Steve Brayton who had fired from the cabin at Isom and dropping
his Winchester he stumbled forward with the butt of his pistol held out
to Raines A Marcum appeared on the other side with the muzzle of his
Winchester down Raines raised both hands then and imperiously called on
every man who had a weapon to come forward and give it up Like children
they came Marcums and Braytons piling their arms on the rock before
him shaking hands right and left and sitting together on the mourners
bench

Old Brayton was humbled thereafter He wanted to shake hands with Steve
Marcum and make friends But Steve grinned and said Not yit and
went off into the bushes A few days later he went to Hazlan of his own
accord and gave up his gun to Raines He wouldnt shake hands with old
Brayton he said nor with any other man who would hire another man
to do his killin but he promised to fight no more and he kept his
word

A flood followed on New Years day Old Gabes canoehis second
canoewas gone and a Marcum and a Brayton worked side by side at the
mill hollowing out another The miller sat at the door whittling

Pears like folks is havin bad luck with thar dugouts said Brayton
Some trifin cuss took old Steve Braytons jes to cross the river
without the grace to tie it to the bank let lone takin it back Ive
heard ez how Aunt Sally Days boy Ben who was afishin that evenin
says ez how he seed Isoms harnt afloatin across the river in it
without techin a paddle

The Marcum laughed Idgits is thick over hyeh he said Bens
agittin wuss sence Isom was killed Yes I recollect Gabe hyeh lost a
canoe jus atter a flood moren a year ago when Rome Stetson n Marthy
Lewallen went agallivantin out n the mountains together Hyehs
another flood n old Gabes dugout gone agin The miller raised
a covert glance of suspicion from under his hat but the Marcum was
laughing Ye oughter put a tracechain on this un he added A rope
gits rotten in the water n a tide is mighty apt to break it

Old Gabe said that mebbe that wus so but he had no chain to waste he
reckoned a rope was strong enough and he started home

Old Gabe dont seem to keer much now bout Isom said the Brayton
Folks say he tuk on so awful at fust that hit looked like he wus goin
crazy Hes gittin downright peert again Hello

Bud Vickers was carrying a piece of news down to Hazlan and he pulled
up his horse to deliver it Aunt Sally Days dog had been seen playing
in the Breathitt road with the frame of a human foot Some boys had
found not far away behind a withered blind a heap of rags and bones
Eli Crump had not been seen in Hazlan since the night of the Marcum
raid

Well ef hit was Eli said the Brayton waggishly were all goin to
be saved Elis case ll come fust an ef thars only one Jedgment Day
the Lord ll nuver git to us

The three chuckled while old Gabe sat dreaming at his gate The boy had
lain quiet during the weeks of his getting well absorbed in one aimto
keep hidden until he was strong enough to get to Rome On the last night
the miller had raised one of the old hearthstones and had given him the
hire of many years At daybreak the lad drifted away Now old Gabe was
following him down the river and on to the dim mountain line where the
boys figure was plain for a moment against the sky and then was lost

The clouds in the west had turned gray and the crescent had broken
the gloom of the woods into shadows when the miller rose One star was
coming over Black Mountain from the east It was the Star of Bethlehem
to old Gabe and starlike on both sides of the Cumberland answering
fires from cabin hearths were giving back its message at last

Thar haint nothin to hender Rome n Marthy now I nuver knowed
anybody to stay way from these mountins ef he could git back n Isom
said hed fetch em Thar haint nothin to hendernothin now

On the stoop of the cabin the miller turned to look again and then on
the last Stetson the door was closed
