THE WAY TO PEACE

 TO LORIN DELAND

 KENNEBUNKPORT MAINE AUGUST 12TH 1910





I

ATHALIA HALL stopped to get her breath and look back over the road
climbing steeply up from the covered bridge It was a little after five
and the delicate air of dawn was full of wood and pasture scentsthe
sweetness of bay and the freshness of dewdrenched leaves In the valley
night still hung like gauze under the trees but the top of the hill was
glittering with sunshine

Why weve hardly come halfway she said

Her husband plodding along behind her nodded ruefully Hardly he
said

In her slim prettiness Athalia Hall looked like a girl but she was
thirtyfour Part of the girlishness lay in the smoothness of her white
forehead and in the sincere intensity of her gaze She wore a blue linen
dress and there was a little soft blue scarf under her chin her
white hat with pink roses and loops of grayblue ribbon shadowed
eager unhumorous eyes the color of forgetmenots Her husband was
her senior by several yearsa large looselimbed man with a scholarly
face and mild calm eyeseyes that were full of a singular tenacity of
purpose Just now his face showed the fatigue of the long climb uphill
and when his wife stopping to look back over the glistening tops of the
birches said I believe its half a mile to the top yet he agreed
breathlessly Hard work he said

It will be worth it when I get to the top and can see the view she
declared and began to climb again

All the same this road will be mighty hot when the sun gets full on
it her husband said and added anxiously I wish I had made you
rest in the station until traintime She flung out her hands with an
exclamation Rest I hate rest

Hold on and Ill give you a stick he called to her its a help
when youre climbing He pulled down a slender birch and setting his
foot on it broke it off at the root She stopped with an impatient
gesture and waited while he tore off handfuls of leaves and whittled
away the sideshoots


Do hurry Lewis she said

They had left their train at five oclock in the morning and had been
sitting in the frowsy station sleepily awaiting the express when
Athalia had had this fancy for climbing the hill so that she might see
the view

It looks pretty steep her husband warned her

It will be something to do anyhow she said and added with a
restless sigh but you dont understand that I suppose

I guess I doafter a fashion he said smiling at her It was only in
loves fashion for really he was incapable of quite understanding her
To the country lawyer of sober piety and granite sense of duty the
rich variety of her moods was a continual wonder and sometimes a painful
bewilderment But whether he understood the impetuous inconsequence
of her temperament after a fashion or whether he failed entirely to
follow the complexity of her thought he met all her fancies with a sort
of tender admiration People said that Squire Hall was henpecked they
also said that he had married beneath him His father had been a
judge and his grandfather a minister he himself was a graduate of a
freshwater college which later when he published his exegesis on the
Prophet Daniel had conferred its little degree upon him and felt that
he was a distinguished son With such a lineage he might have done
better people said than to marry that girl who was the most fickle
creature and no housekeeper and whose peoplethis they told one
another in reserved voiceswere PLAYACTORS Athalias mother who
had been the playactor had left her children an example of
dutydomestic as well as professional dutyfaithfully done As she did
not leave anything else Athalia added nothing to the Hall fortune but
Lewiss law practice which was hardly more than conveyancing now and
then was helped out by a sawmill which the Halls had owned for two
generations So as things were they were able to live in humdrum
prosperity which gave Lewis plenty of time to browse about among his
grandfathers old theological books and byandby to become a very
sound Hebrew scholar and spared Athalia much wholesome occupation which
would have been steadying to her eager nature She was one of those
people who express every passing emotion as a flower expresses each
wind that sways it upon its stalk But with expression the emotion
ended

But she isnt fickle Lewis had defended her once to a privileged
relation who had made the accusation basing it on the fact that Athalia
had sewed her fingers off for the Missionary Society one winter and
done nothing the nextAthalia ISNT fickle Lewis explained
fickle people are insincere Athalia is perfectly sincere but she
is temporary thats all Anyway she wants to do something else this
winter and Thalia must have her head

Your heads better than hers young man the venturesome relative
insisted

But it must be her head and not mine Aunty when it comes to doing
what she thinks is right even if its wrong he said smiling

Well tell her shes a little fool cried the old lady viciously

You cant do that with Thalia Lewis explained patiently because
it would make her unhappy She takes everything so dreadfully hard she
feels things more than other people do

Lewis said the little old wrinkled privileged greataunt think
a little less of her feelings and a little more of your own or youll
make a mess of things

Lewis Hall was too respectful to tell the old lady what he thought of
such selfish advice he merely did not act upon it Instead he went on
giving a great deal of thought to Athalias feelings That was why
he and she were climbing the hill in the dewy silence of this August
morning Athalia had felt that she wanted to see the viewthough
it would have been better for her to have rested in the station
Lewis thoughtI ought to have coaxed her out of it he reproached
himself It certainly was a hard walk considering that it followed
a broken night in the sleepingcar They had left the train at five
oclock in the morning and were sitting in the station awaiting the
express when Athalia had had this impulse to climb the hill It looks
pretty steep Lewis objected and she flung out her hands with an
impatient gesture

I love to climb she said So here they were almost at the top
panting and toiling Athalias skirts wet with dew and Lewiss face
drawn with fatigue

Look she said its all open We can sit down and see all over the
world She left the road springing lightly through the fringing bay
and briers toward an open space on the hillside There is a gate in the
wall she called out it seems to be some sort of enclosure Lewis
help me to open the gate Hurry What a queer place What do you suppose
it is

The gate opened into a little field bounded by a stone wall the grass
had been lately mowed and the stubble glistening with dew showed
the curving swaths of the scythe across it in even lines from wall to
wall were rows of small stakes painted black Here and there were faint
depressions low green cradles in the grass each depression was
marked at the head and foot by these iron stakes hardly higher than the
stubble itself

Shakers graveyard I guess Lewis said Ive heard that they dont
use gravestones Peaceful place isnt it

Her vivid face was instantly grave Very peaceful Oh she added as
they sat down in the shadow of a pine dont you sometimes want to lie
down and sleepdeep down in the grass and flowers

Well he confessed I dont believe it would be as interesting as
walking round on top of them

She looked at him in despair

Come now he defended himself you dont take much to peace yourself
at home

You dont understand she said passionately

There there little Tay he said smiling and putting a soothing
hand on hers I guess I doafter a fashion

It was very still below them the valley had suddenly brimmed with
sunshine that flickered and twinkled on the birch leaves or shimmered
on sombre stretches of pine and spruce Close at hand pennyroyal grew
thick in the shadow of the wall and just beyond mullen candles cast
slender bars of shade across the grass The sunken graves and the lines
of iron markers lay before them

How quiet it is she said in a whisper

I guess Ill smoke Lewis said and scratched a match on his trousers

How can you she protested it is profane

He gave her an amused look but lighted his cigar and smoked dreamily
for a minute then he drew a long breath I was pretty tired he said
and turned to glance back at the road A horse and cart were coming
in at the open gate the elderly driver singing to himself drew up
abruptly at the sight of the two under the pinetree then drove toward
them the wheels of the cart jolting cheerfully over the cradling
graves He had a sickle in his hand and as he clambered down from the
seat he said with friendly curiosity

You folks are out early for the worlds people

Is this a graveyard Athalia demanded impetuously

Yee he said smiling its our burialplace were Shakers

But why are there just the stakeswithout names

Why should there be names he said whimsically they have new names
now

Where is your community Can we go and visit it

Yee but were not much to see he said just men and women like
you Only were happy I guess thats all the difference

But what a difference she exclaimed and Lewis smiled

Ive come up for pennyroyal the Shaker explained sociably it grows
thick round here

Tell me about the Shakers Athalia pleaded What do you believe

Well he said a simple shrewdness glimmering in his brown eyes
if you go to the Trustees House down there in the valley Eldress
Hannahll tell you all about us And the sisters have baskets and pretty
truck to sellthings the worlds people like Go and ask the Eldress
what we believe and shell show you the baskets

She turned eagerly to her husband Never mind the tenoclock train
Lewis Let us go

We could take a later train all right he admitted but

Oh PLEASE she entreated joyously Well help you pick pennyroyal
she added to the Shaker

But this he would not allow I doubt youd be careful enough he said
mildly Sister Lydia was the only female I ever knew who could pick
herbs

Do you get paid for the work you do Athalia asked practically Lewis
flushed at the boldness of such a question but the old man chuckled

Should I pay myself he asked

You own everything in common dont you Lewis said

Yee said the Shaker were all brothers and sisters Nobody tries to
get ahead of anybody else

And you dont believe in marriage Athalia asserted

We are as the angels of God he said simply

He left them and began to sickle his herbs with the cheerfully obvious
purpose of escaping further interruption

Athalia instantly bubbled over with questions but Lewis could tell her
hardly more of the Shakers than she knew already

No it isnt free love he said theyre decent enough They believe
in general love not particular I suppose Thalia do you think
its worth while to wait over a train just to see the settlement

Of course it is He said they were happy I would like to see what kind
of life makes people happy

He looked at the lighted end of his cigar and smiled but he said
nothing Afterward as they followed the cart across the field and out
into the road Athalia asked the old herbgatherer many questions about
the happiness of the community life which he answered patiently enough
Once or twice he tried to draw into their talk the silent husband
who walked at her side but Lewis had nothing to say Only when some
reference was made to one of the Prophecies did he look up in sudden
interest You take that to mean the Judgment do you he said And for
the rest of the walk to the settlement the two men discussed the point
the Shaker walking with one hand on the heavy shaft for the support it
gave him and Lewis keeping step with him

At the foot of the hill the road widened into a grassy street on both
sides of which under the elms and maples were the community houses
big and substantial but gauntly plain their yellow paint flaking and
peeling here and there shone clean and fresh in the sparkle of morning
Except for a black cat whose fur glistened like jet dozing on a white
doorstep the settlement steeped in sunshine showed no sign of life
There was a strange remoteness from time about the place a sort of
emptiness and a silence that silenced even Athalia

Where IS everybody she said in a lowered voice as she spoke a
child in a blue apron came from an open doorway and tugged a basket
across the street

Are there children here Lewis asked surprised and their guide said
sadly

Not as many as there ought to be The new school laws have made a great
difference Weve only got two Folks used to send em to us to bring
up oftentimes they stayed on after they were of age Sister Lydia came
that way Well well she tired of us Lydy did poor girl She went
back into the world twenty years ago now And Sister Jane she was a
boundout child too he rambled on she came here when she was six
shes seventy now

What Lewis exclaimed has she never known anything butthis

His shocked tone did not disturb the old man Want to see my
herbhouse he said Guess youll find some of the sisters in the
sortingroom Im Nathan Dale he added courteously

They had come to the open door of a great weatherbeaten building from
whose open windows an aromatic breath wandered out into the summer
air As they crossed the worn threshold Athalia stopped and caught her
breath in the overpowering scent of drying herbs then they followed
Brother Nathan up a shaky flight of steps to the loft Here some elderly
women sitting on low benches were sorting over great piles of herbs in
silencethe silence apparently of peace and meditation Two of
them were dressed like worlds people but the others wore small gray
shouldercapes buttoned to their chins and little caps of white net
stretched smoothly over wire frames the narrow shirrings inside the
frames fitted so close to their peaceful wrinkled foreheads that no
hair could be seen

I wish I could sit and sort herbs Athalia said under her breath

Brother Nathan chuckled For how long he asked and then introduced
her to the three workers who greeted her calmly and went on sorting
their herbs The loft was dark and cool the windowframes in which
there were no sashes opened wide on the still August fields and woods
the occasional brief words of the sortingwomen seemed to drop into a
pool of fragrant silence The two visitors followed Brother Nathan down
the room between piles of sorted herbs and out into the sunshine again
Athalia drew a breath of ecstasy

Its all so beautifully tranquil she whispered looking about her
with blue excited eyes

Tay and tranquillity Lewis said with an amused laugh

But as they went along the grassy street this sense of tranquillity
closed about them like a palpable peace Now and then they stopped and
spoke to some onealways an elderly person and in each old face the
experiences that life writes in unerasable lines about eyes and lips
were hidden by a veil of calmness that was curiously unhuman

It isnt canny exactly Lewis told his wife in a low voice But she
did not seem to hear him She asked many questions of Eldress Hannah
who had taken them in charge and once or twice she burst into impetuous
appreciation of the idea of brotherhood and even of certain theological
principleswhich last diverted her husband very much Eldress Hannah
showed them the dairy and the workroom and all there was to see
with a patient hospitality that kept them at an infinite distance She
answered Lewiss questions about the community with a sad directness

Yee there are not many of us now The worlds people say were dying
out But the Lord will preserve the remnant to redeem the world young
man Yee when they come in from the world they cast their possessions
into the whole we own nothing for ourselves Nay we dont have many
come Brother William was the last Why did he come She looked coldly
at Athalia who had asked the question Because he saw the way to
peace Hed had strife enough in the world Yee she admitted briefly
some fall from grace and leave us The last was Lydia She was one
of our children and I thought she was of the chosen But she was only
thirty when she fell away and you cant expect wisdom at that age That
was nearly twenty years ago When she has tasted the dregs of the world
she will come back to usif she lives Eldress Hannah ended

Athalia listened breathlessly her rapt unhumorous eyes fixed on
Eldress Hannahs still face Now and then she asked a question and
once cried out that after all why wasnt it the way to live Peace and
selfsacrifice and love Oh she said turning to her husband cant
you feel the attraction of it I should think even you could feel it

I think I feel itafter a fashion he said mildly I think I have
always felt the attraction of community life

Afterward when they had left all this somnolent peace and begun the
long walk back to the station he explained what he meant I couldnt
say so before the Eldress but of course there are times when anybody
can feel the charm of getting rid of personal responsibilityand that
is what community life really means Its the relief of being a little
cog in a big machine in fact the very attraction of it is a sort
of temptation to my way of looking at it But itwell it made me
sleepy he confessed

For once his wife had no reply She was very quiet on that return
journey in the cars and in the days that followed she kept referring to
their visit with a persistence that surprised her husband She thought
the net caps were beautiful she thought the exquisite cleanness of
everything was like a perfumethe perfume of a wild rose she said
ecstatically She thought the having everything in common was the way to
live And just think how peaceful it is

Well yes Lewis said I suppose its peacefulafter a fashion
Anything that isnt alive is peaceful

But their idea of brotherhood is the highest kind of life

The only fault I have to find with it is that it isnt human he said
mildly He had no desire to prove or disprove anything Athalia was
looking better just because she was interested in something and that
was enough for Lewis When she proposed to read a book on Shakerism
aloud he fell into her mood with what was for him enthusiasm he
declared he would like nothing better and he put his daily paper aside
without a visible regret

Well he admitted I must say theres more to it than I supposed
Theyve studied the Prophecies thats evident And theyre not narrow
in their belief Theyre really Unitarians

Narrow she saidthey are as wide as heaven itself And oh the
peace of it

But they are NOT human he would insist smiling no marriagethats
not human little Tay

It was not until two months later that he began to feel vaguely uneasy
Yes its interesting he admitted but nobody in these days would
want to be a Shaker To which she replied boldly Why not

That was all but it was enough Lewis Halls face suddenly sobered
He had not stumbled along behind her in all her emotional experiences
without learning to read the guideposts to her thought I hope shell
get through with it soon he said to himself with a worried frown
it isnt wholesome for a mind like Thalias to dwell on this kind of
thing

It was in November that she broke to him that she had written Eldress
Hannah to ask if she might come and visit the community and had been
answered Yee

Lewis was silent with consternation he went out to the sawmill and
climbed up into the loft to think it all out alone Should he forbid
it He knew that was nonsense in the first place his conception of
the relation of husband and wife did not include that kind of thing but
more than that opposition would he said to himself push her in
Not into Shakerism Thalia couldnt be a Shaker to save her life he
thought with an involuntary smile but into an excited discontent with
her comfortable prosaic life No definite opposition to the visit must
not be thought ofbut he must try and persuade her not to go How What
plea could he offer His own loneliness without her he could not
bring himself to speak of he shrank from taking what seemed to him an
advantage He might urge that she would find it cold and uncomfortable
in those old frame houses high up on the hills or that it would be bad
for her health to take the rather wearing journey at this time of year
But he knew too well how little effect any such prudent counsels would
have The very fact that her interest had lasted for more than three
months showed that it had really struck roots into her mind and mere
prudence would not avail much Still he would urge prudence then if
she was determined she must go Shell get sick of it in a fortnight
he said but for the present he must let her have her head even if
she was making a mistake She had a right to have her head he reminded
himselfbut I must tell those people to keep her warm she takes cold
so easily

He got up and looked out of the window below in the race there was a
jam of logs and the air was keen with the pungent smell of sawdust and
new boards The whir and thud of the machinery downstairs sent a faint
quiver through the planks under his feet The mill will net a good
profit this year he said to himself absently Thalia can have
pretty nearly anything she wants And even as he said it he had a
sudden vague misgiving if she didnt have everything she wanted
perhaps she would be happier But the idea was too new and too subtle to
follow up so the result of that troubled hour in the millchamber was
only that he made no very resolute objection to Athalias acceptance
of Eldress Hannahs permission to come It had been given grudgingly
enough


The family were gathered in the sittingroom they had had their
supperthe eight elderly women and the three elderly men all that were
left of the community The room had the austere and shining cleanness
which Athalia had called a perfume but it was full of homely comfort
A blueandwhite rag carpet in the centre left a border of bare floor
painted pumpkinyellow there was a glittering airtight stove with
isinglass windows that shone like square red eyes a gay patchwork
cushion in the seat of a rockingchair was given up to the black cat
whose sleek fur glistened in the lamplight Three of the sisters knitted
silently two others rocked back and forth their tired idle hands
in their laps their eyes closed the other three yawned and spoke
occasionally between themselves of their various tasks Brother Nathan
read his weekly FARMER Brother William turned over the leaves of
a hymnbook and appeared to count them with noiseless moving lips
Brother George cut pictures out of the back of a magazine yawning
sometimes and looking often at his watch Into this quietness Eldress
Hannahs still voice came

I have heard from Lydia again There was a faint stir but no one
spoke The Lord is dealing with her Eldress Hannah said she is in
great misery

Brother George nodded That is good He works in a mysterious
wayshes real miserable is she Well well thats good The mercies
of the Lord are everlasting he ended in a satisfied voice and began
to read again

Amenamen said Brother William vaguely

Poor Lydy Brother Nathan murmured

And I had another letter the Eldress proceeded from that young
woman who came here in AugustAthalia Hall do you remembershe asked
two questions to the minute She wants to visit us

Brother Nathan looked at her over his spectacles and one of the sisters
opened her eyes

I dont see why she should Eldress Hannah added

Two of the old brothers nodded agreement

The curiosity of the worlds people does not help their souls said
one of the knitters

She thinks we walk in the Way to Peace said the Eldress

Yee we do said Brother George

Shall I tell her nay the Eldress questioned calmly

Yee said Brother George and the dozing sisters murmured Yee

Wait said Brother Nathan her husbandHE has something to him Let
her come

But if she visited us how would that affect him Eldress Hannah
asked surprised into faint animation

If she was moved to stay it would affect him Brother Nathan said
dryly he would come too and there are very few of us left Eldress
He would be a great gain

There was a long silence Brother Williams gray head sagged on his
shoulder and the hymnbook slipped from his gnarled old hands The
knitting sisters began one after another to stab their needles into
their balls of gray yarn and roll their work up in their aprons

Its getting late Eldress one of them said and glanced at the
clock

Then Ill tell her she may come said Eldress Hannah reluctantly

He can make the wrath of man to praise Him Brother Nathan encouraged
her

Yee but I never heard that He could make the foolishness of woman do
it the old woman said grimly

As the brothers and sisters parted at the door of the sittingroom
Brother Nathan plucked at the Eldresss sleeve Is she very
wretchedLydia Where is she now Eldress Poor Lydy poor little
Lydy


The fortnight of Athalias absence wore greatly upon her husband
Apprehension lurked in the back of his mind In the mill or out on the
farm or when he sat down among his shabby old calfskin books he was
assailed by the memory of all her various fancies during their married
life Some of them were no more remarkable or unexpected than this
interest in Shakerism He began to be slowly frightened Suppose she
should take it into her head

When her fortnight was nearly up and he was already deciding whether
when he drove over to Depot Corners to meet her he would take Ginnys
colt or the new mare a letter came to say she was going to stay a week
longer

I believe she wroteher very pen in the frantic downhill slope of
her lines betraying the excitement of her thoughtsI believe that for
the first time in my life I have found my God The letter was full
of dashes and underlining and on the last page there was a blistered
splash into which the ink had run a little on the edges

Lewis Halls heart contracted with an almost physical pang I must go
and get her right off he said this thing is serious And yet after
a wakeful night he decided with the extraordinary respect for her
individuality so characteristic of the mana respect that may be called
foolish or divine as you happen to look at ithe decided not to go
If he dragged her away from the Shakers against her will what would be
gained I must give her her head and let her see for herself that its
all moonshine he told himself painfully over and over my seeing
it wont accomplish anything But he counted the hours until she would
come home

When she came as soon as he saw her walking along the platform looking
for him while he stood with his hand on Ginnys colts bridle even
before she had spoken a single word even then he knew what had
happenedthe uplifted radiance of her face announced it

But she did not tell him at once On the drive home in the dark
December afternoon he was tense with apprehension once or twice he
ventured some questions about the Shakers but she put them aside with a
curious gentleness her voice a little distant and monotonous her words
seemed to come only from the surface of her mind When he lifted her out
of the sleigh at their own door he felt a subtle resistance in her whole
body and when in the hall he put his arms about her and tried to kiss
her she drew back sharply and said

NoPLEASE Then as they stood there in the chilly entry she burst
into a passionate explanation she had been convicted and converted She
had found her Saviour She

There there little Tay he broke in sadly supper is ready dear
He heard a smothered exclamationthat it was smothered showed how
completely she was immersed in a new experience one of the details of
which was the practice of selfcontrol

But of course that night they had it out When they came into the
sittingroom after supper she flung the news into his pale face _she
wished to join the Shakers_ But she must have his consent she added
impatiently because otherwise the Shakers would not let her come

Thats the only thing I dont agree with them about she said
candidly I dont think they ought to make anything so solemn
contingent upon the consent of any other human being But of course
Lewis its only a form I have left you in spirit and that is what
counts So I told them I knew you would consent

She looked at him with those blue ecstatic eyes so oblivious to
his pain that for a moment a sort of impersonal amazement at such
selfcentredness held him silent But after the first shock he spoke
with a slow fluency that pierced Athalias egotism and stirred an
answering astonishment in her His weeks of vague misgiving deepening
into keen apprehension had given him protests and arguments which
although they never convinced her silenced her temporarily She had
never known her husband in this character Of course she had been
prepared for objections and entreaties but sound arguments and stern
disapproval confused and annoyed her She had supposed he would tell her
she would break his heart instead he said calmly that she hadnt the
head for Shakerism

Youve got to be very reasonable Thalia to stand a community life
or else youve got to be an awful fool You are neither one nor the
other

I believe their doctrines she declared and I would die for a
religious belief But I dont suppose you ever felt that you could die
for a thing

I think I haveafter a fashion he said mildly but dying for a
thing is easy its living for it thats hard You couldnt keep it up
Athalia you couldnt live for it

Well of course that night was only the beginning The days and weeks
that followed were full of argument of entreaty of determination
Perhaps if he had laughed at her But it is dangerous to laugh
at unhumorous people for if they get angry all is lost So he never
laughed nor in all their talks did he ever reproach her for not
loving him Once only his plea was personaland even then it was only
indirectly so

Athalia he said theres only one kind of pain in this world that
never gets cured Its the pain that comes when you remember that youve
made somebody who loved you unhappynot for a principle but for your
own pleasure I know that pain and I know how it lasts Once I did
something just to please myself that hurt mothers feelings Id give
my right hand if I hadnt done it Its twentytwo years ago and I
wasnt more than a boy and she forgave me and forgot all about it I
have never forgotten it I wish to God I could Thalia I dont want
you to suffer that kind of pain

She saw the implication rather than the warning and she burst out
angrily that she wasnt doing this for pleasure she was doing it for
principle It was for the salvation of her soul

Athalia he said solemnly the salvation of our souls depends on
doing our duty

Ah she broke in triumphantly out of your own lipsisnt it my
duty to do what seems to me right

He considered a minute Well yes I suppose the most valuable example
any one can set is to do what he or she believes to be right It may be
wrong but that is not the point We must do what we conceive to be
our duty Only weve got to be sure Tay in deciding upon duty in
deciding what is rightweve got to be sure that selfinterest is
eliminated I dont believe anybody can decide absolutely on what is
right without eliminating self

She frowned at this impatiently its perfect fairness meant nothing to
her

You promised to be my wife he went on with a curious sternness
it is obviously right and so it is your first duty to keep your
promiseat least so long as my conduct does not absolve you from
it Then he added hastily with careful justice Of course Im not
talking about promises to love they are nonsense Nobody can promise to
love Promises to do our duty are all that count

That was the only reproach he madeif it was a reproachfor his
betrayed love It was just as well Discussion on this subject between
husbands and wives is always futile Nothing was ever accomplished by
it and yet in spite of the verdict of time and experience that nothing
is gained over and over the jealous man and still more frequently the
jealous woman protests against a lost love with a bitterness that
kills pity and turns remorse into antagonism But Lewis Hall made no
reproaches Perhaps Athalia missed them perhaps under her spiritual
passion she was piqued that earthly passion was so readily silenced
But if she was she did not know it She was entirely sincere
and intensely happy in a new experience It was a long winter of
argumentand then suddenly in early April the break came

I WILL go I have a right to save my soul

And he said very simply Well Athalia then Ill go too

You But you dont believe And almost in the Bible words he answered
her No but where you go I will go where you live I will live And
then a moment later I promised to cleave to you little Tay




II

THE uprooting of their life took a surprisingly short time In all those
dark months of argument Lewis Hall had been quietly making plans for
this final step and such preparation betrayed his knowledge from the
first of the hopelessness of his struggleindeed the struggle had only
been loyalty to a lost cause His calm assent to his wifes ultimatum
left her a little blank but in the immediate excitement of removal in
the thrill of martyrdom that came with publicity the blankness did not
last What the publicity was to her husband she could not understand
He received the protests of his family in stolid silence when the
venturesome greataunt told him what she thought of him he smiled
when his brother informed him that he was a fool he said he shouldnt
wonder When the minister egged on by distracted Hall relatives
remonstrated he replied respectfully that he was doing what he
believed to be his duty and if it seems to be a duty I cant help
myself you see that dont you he said anxiously But that was
practically all he found to say for the most part he was silent
Athalia in her absorption probably had not the slightest idea of the
agonies of mortification which he suffered her imagination told her
truly enough what angry relatives and pleasantly horrified neighbors
said about her and the abuse exhilarated her very much but her
imagination stopped there It did not give her the familys opinion of
her husband it did not whisper the gossip of the grocerystore and the
postoffice it did not repeat the chuckles or echo the innuendoes

So Squire Halls wifes got tired of him Rather live with the Shakers
than him I like Hall but I havent any sympathy with him the
doctor said what in thunder did he let her go gallivanting off to
visit the Shakers for Might have known a female like Mrs Halld get a
bee in her bonnet He ought to have kept her at home _I_ would have I
wouldnt have had any such nonsense in my family Well for an obstinate
man and he IS obstinate you know the squire when it comes to his
wife has no more backbone than a wet string

Wonder if theres anything under it all came the sly insinuation of
gossip wonder if she hasnt got something besides the Shakers up her
sleeve You wait

If Athalias imagination spared her these comments Lewiss
unimaginative common sense supplied them He knew what other men and
husbands were saying about him what servants and gossip and friends
insinuated to one another and set his jaw in silence He made no excuse
and no explanation Why should he The facts spoke His wife did prefer
the Shakers to her husband and her home To have interfered with her
purpose by any plea of his personal unhappiness or by any threat of an
appeal to law or even by refusing to give the consent essential to
her admission would not have altered these facts As for his reasons
for going with her they would not have enhanced his dignity in the eyes
of the men who wouldnt have had any such nonsense in their families he
must be near her to see that she did not suffer too much hardship and
to bring her home when she was ready to come

In those days of tearing his life up by the roots the silent man was
just a little more silent that was all But the fact was burning into
his consciousness he couldnt keep his wife That was what they said
and that was the truth It seemed to him as if his soul blushed at
his helplessness But his face was perfectly stolid He told Athalia
passively that he had rented the house and mill to Henry Davis that he
had settled half his capital upon her so that she would have some money
to put into the common treasury of the community then he added that
he had taken a house for himself near the settlement and that he would
hire out to the Shakers when they were haying or do any farmwork that
he could get

I can take care of myself I guess he said I used to camp out when
I was a boy and I can cook pretty well mother always said He looked
at her wistfully but the uncomfortableness of such an arrangement
did not strike her In her desire for a new emotion her eagerness to
FEELthat eagerness which is really a sensuality of the mindshe was
too absorbed in her own selfchosen hardships to think of his which
were not entirely selfchosen


I think I can find enough to do he said the Shakers need an
ablebodied man they only have those three old men

How do you know that she asked quickly

Ive been to see them twice this winter he said

Why she said amazed you never told me

I dont tell you everything nowadays Thalia he said briefly

In those two visits to the Shakers Lewis Hall had been treated with
great delicacy there had been no effort to proselytize and equally
there had been no triumphing over the accession of his wife in fact
Athalia was hardly referred to except when they told him that they
would take good care of her and when Brother Nathan volunteered a brief
summary of Shaker doctrinesso as you can feel easy about her he
explained We believe that Christ was the male principle in Deity and
Mother Ann was the female principle And we believe in confession of
our sins and communion with the deadspiritualism they call it
nowadaysand in the virgin life Shakers dont marry nor give in
marriage And we have all things in common Thats all friend You see
we dont teach anything that Christ didnt teach so she wont learn any
evil from us Simple aint it

Well yes after a fashion Lewis Hall said but it isnt human

And Brother Nathan smiled mystically Maybe that isnt against it in
the long run he said


They came to the community in the spring twilight The brothers and
sisters had assembled to meet the convert and to give a neighborly hand
to the silent man who was to live by himself in a little gray shingled
house down on Lonely Lake Road It was a supreme moment to Athalia She
had expected an intense parting from her husband when they left their
own house and she was ready to press into her soul the poignant thorn
of grief not only because it would make her FEEL but because it would
emphasize in her own mind the divine selfsacrifice which she wanted to
believe she was making But when the moment came to close the door of
the old home behind them her husband was cruelly commonplace about
itfor poor Lewis had no more drama in him than a kindly Newfoundland
dog He was full of practical cares for his tenant and he stopped even
while he was turning the key in the lock to fuss as Athalia said
over some last details of the transfer of the sawmill Athalia could
not tear herself from arms that placidly consented to her withdrawal so
there had been no rending ecstasies In consequence on the journey up
to the community she was a little morose a little irritable even just
as the drunkard is apt to be irritable when sobriety is unescapable
But at the door of the Family House she had her opportunity she said
dramatically Goodnight_Brother Lewis_ It was an entirely sincere
moment Dramatic natures are not often insincere they are only unreal

As for her husband he said calmly Goodnight dear and trudged
off in the cool May dusk down Lonely Lake Road He found the door of
the house on the latch and a little fire glowing in the stove Brother
Nathan had seen to that and had left some food on the table for him
But in spite of the old mans friendly foresight the house had all the
desolation of confusion in the kitchen there were two or three cases of
books broken open but not unpacked a trunk and a carpetbag and some
bundles of groceries they had been left by the expressman on tables and
chairs and on the floor so that the solitary man had to do some lifting
and unpacking before he could sit down in his loneliness to eat the
supper Brother Nathan had provided He looked about to see where he
would put up shelves for his books and as he did so the remembrance of
his quiet shabby old study came to him almost like a blow

Well he said to himself this wont be for so very long Well be
back again in a year I guess Poor little Tay I shouldnt wonder if it
was six months I wonder can I buy Henry Davis off if she wants to go
back in six months

And yet in spite of his calm understanding of the situation the wound
burned As he went about putting things into some semblance of order
he paused once and looked hard into the fire When she did want to go
backlet it be in six months or six weeks or six dayswould things be
the same Something had been done to the very structure and fabric of
their life Can it ever be the same he said to himself and then
he passed his hand over his eyes in a bewildered wayWill I be the
same he said




III

SUMMER at the Shaker settlement lying in the green cup of the hills
was very beautiful The yellow houses along the grassy street drowsed in
the sunshine and when the wind stirred the maple leaves one could
see the distant sparkle of the lake Athalia had a fancy in the warm
twilights for walking down Lonely Lake Road that jolted over logs and
across gullies and stopped abruptly at the waters edge She had to pass
Lewiss house on the way and if he saw her he would call out to her
cheerfully

Hullo Thalia how are you dear

And she with prim intensity would reply Goodevening BROTHER
Lewis

If one of the sisters was with her they would stop and speak to him
otherwise she passed him by in such an eager consciousness of her part
that he smiledand then sighed When she had a companion Lewis and the
other Shakeress would gossip about the weather or the haying and Lewis
would have the chance to say Youre not overworking Thalia Youre
not tired While Athalia in her net cap and her gray shoulder cape
buttoned close up to her chin would dismiss the anxious affection
with a peremptory Of course not I have bread to eat you know not of
Brother Lewis Then she would add didactically some word of dogma or
admonition

But she had not much time to give to Brother Lewiss salvationshe was
so busy in adjusting herself to her new life Its picturesque details
fascinated herthe cap the brevity of speech the small mannerisms
the occasional and very reserved mysticism absorbed her so that she
thought very little of her husband She saw him occasionally on those
walks down to the lake or when after a day in the fields with the
three old Shaker men Brother Nathan brought him home to supper

We Shakers are given to hospitality he said were always looking
for the angel we are going to entertain unawares Come along home with
us Lewis And Lewis would plod up the hill and take his turn at the
tin washbasin and then file down the mens side of the stairs to the
diningroom where he and the three old brothers sat at one table and
Athalia and the eight sisters sat at the other table After supper he
had the chance to see Athalia and to make sure that she was not looking
tired You didnt take cold yesterday Thalia I saw you were out in
the rain he would say And she always a little embarrassed at such
personal interest would reply primly I am not at all tired Brother
Lewis Nathan used to walk home with his guest and sometimes they
talked of work that must be done and sometimes touched on more
unpractical thingsthose spiritual manifestations which at rare
intervals centred in Brother William and were the hope of the whole
community For who could tell when the old mans incoherent muttering
would break into the clear speech of one of those Heavenly Visitants
who in the early days had descended upon the Shakers and then for
some divine and deeply mysterious reason withdrawn from such pure
channels of communication and manifested themselves in the worldbut
through base and sordid natures Poor vague Brother William who saw
visions and dreamed dreams was in this community the torch that held
a smouldering spark of the divine fire and when in a cataleptic
state his faint intelligence fluttered back into some dim depths of
personality and he moaned and muttered using awful names with babbling
freedom Brother Nathan and the rest listened with pathetic eagerness
for a _thus saith the Lord_ which should enflame the gray embers of
Shakerism and give light to the whole world When Nathan talked of these
things he would add with a sigh that he hoped some day William would
be inspired to tell them something more of Sister Lydia Once William
said Coming coming _I_ think it meant Lydia but Eldress thought
it was Athalia it was just before she came Brother Nathan sighed I
wish it had meant Lydy he said simply

If Lewis wished it had meant Lydy he did not say so And indeed
he said very little upon any subject Brother Nathan did most of the
talking

I fled from the City of Destruction when I was thirty he told Lewis
that was just a year before Sister Lydy left us Poor Lydy poor Lydy
he said Oh yee _I_ know the world I know it my boy Do you

Why after a fashion Lewis said and then he asked suddenly Why
did you turn Shaker Nathan

Well I got hold of a Shaker book that set me thinking Sister Lydia
gave it to me I met Sister Lydia when she had come down to the place I
lived to sell baskets And she was interested in my salvation and
gave me the book Then I got to figuring out the Prophecies and I saw
Shakerism fulfilled them and then I began to see that when you dont
own anything yourself you cant worry about your property well that
clinched me I guess Poor Sister Lydia she didnt abide in grace
herself he ended sadly

I should have thought you would have been sorry then that you Lewis
began but checked himself How abouthe said and stopped to clear
his voice which broke huskilyhow about love between man and woman
Husband and wife

Marriage is honorable Brother Nathan conceded Shakers dont despise
marriage But they like to see folks grow out of it into something
better likelike your wife maybe

Well your doctrine would put an end to the world Lewis said
smiling

I guess said Brother Nathan dryly there aint any immediate danger
of the world coming to an end

Id like to see that book Lewis said when they parted at the
pasturebars where a footpath led down the hill to his own house

And that night Brother Nathan had an eager word for the family Hes
asked for a book he said The Eldress smiled doubtfully but Athalia
with a rapturous upward look said

May the Lord guide him then added practically It wont amount to
anything He thinks Shakerism isnt human

Thats not against it thats not against it Nathan declared
smiling Ive told him so a dozen times

But Athalia was so happy that first year and so important that she did
not often concern herself with the welfare of the man who had been her
husband Insteadit was early in Aprilhe concerned himself with hers
he tried tentatively to see if it wasnt almost time for Athalia to
get through with it Of course afterward Sister Athalia realized
with chagrin that this attempt was only a forerunner of the fever that
was developing which in a few days was to make him a very sick man
But for the moment his question seemed to her a temptation of the devil
and of course resisted temptation made her faith stronger than ever

It was a deliciously cold spring night Lewis had drawn the table with
his books on it close to the fire to try to keep warm but he shivered
even while his shoulders scorched and somehow he could not keep his
mind on the black rectangular characters of the Hebrew page before
him He had been interested in Brother Nathans explanation of Hoseas
forecasting of Shakerism and he had admitted to himself that if Nathan
was correct there would be something to be said for Shakerism The
idea made him vaguely uneasy because that something might be so
conclusive thatBut he could not face such a possibility

He wanted to dig at the text so that he might refute Nathan but
somehow that night he was too dull to refute anybody and byandby he
pushed the blacklettered page aside and crouching over the fire held
out his hands to the blaze He thought vaguely of the big fireplace in
the old study and suddenly in the chilly numbness of his mind he saw
itwith such distinctness that he was startled Then a moment later
it changed into the south chamber that had been his mothers bedroomhe
could even detect the faint scent of rosegeranium that always hung
about her he noticed that the green shutters on the west windows were
bowed and from between them a line of sunshine fell across the matting
on the floor and touched the fourposter that had a chintz spread and
valance How well he knew the faded roses and the cockatoos on that old
chintz Over there by the window he had caught her crying that time he
had hurt her feelings just for his own pleasure the old stab of this
thought pierced through the feverish mists and touched the quick He
struggled numbly with the visualization of fever brushing his hot hand
across his eyes and trying to see which was realthe geraniumsweet
south chamber or the chilly house on Lonely Lake Road Athalia had given
him pain in that same wayjust for her own pleasure Poor little Tay
He was afraid it would hurt her some day when she realized it well
when she came to herself when she got through her playing at Shakerism
he must not let her know how great the pain had been she would suffer
too much if she should understand his misery and Athalia didnt bear
suffering well But how long she had been getting over Shakerism He
had thought it would only last six months and here it was a year Well
if Nathans reading of the Prophecies was right then Athalia would
never get over it She ought never to get over it Then what would
become of the farm and the sawmill And instantly everything was unreal
again he could hear the hum of the drivingwheel and the screech of the
saw tearing through a log how fragrant the fresh planks were and the
great heaps of sawdustbut the noise made his head ache andand the
fire didnt seem hot

It was in one of those moments when the mists thinned and he knew that
he was shivering over the stove instead of basking in the sunshine in
his mothers room that smelled of rosegeranium leaves that Athalia
came in She looked conscious and confused full of a delightful
embarrassment at being for once alone with him The color was deep on
her cheeks and her eyes were starry

Eldress asked me to bring your mail down to you Brother Lewis she
said

Thalia he said I am so glad to see you dear II seem to be
rather used up somehow The mists had quite cleared away but
a violent headache made his words stumble I was just wondering
Thaliadont you think you might go home now Youve had a whole year
of itand I really ought to go homethe mill

Why Lewis Hall What do you mean she said forgetting her part in
her indignation I am a Shakeress Youve no right to speak so to me

He blinked at her through the blur of pain I wish youd stay with
me Athalia Ive got aa sort ofheadache Never mind about being a
Shakeress just for tonight It would be such a comfort to have you

But Athalia with a horrified look had left him She fled home in
the darkness with burning cheeks she debated with herself whether she
should tell Eldress how her husbandno Brother Lewishad tried to
tempt her back to him In her excitement at this lure of the devil she
even wondered whether Lewis had pretended that he was ill to induce her
to stay with him But even Athalias imagination could not compass such
a thought of Lewis for more than a moment so she only told the Eldress
that Brother Lewis had tried to persuade her to go back to the world
with him The Lord had defended her she said excitedly and she had
forbidden him to speak to her

Eldress Hannah looked perplexed Thats not like Lewis I wonder
But she did not say what she wondered Instead she went early in the
morning down Lonely Lake Road to Lewiss house The poor fellow was
entirely in the mists by that time shivering and burning and quite
unconscious saying over and over She wouldnt stay she wouldnt
stay

Lure her back said Eldress Hannah with a snort Poor boy Its
good riddance for him

But Eldress Hannah stayed and Brother Nathan joined her and for many
days the little community was shaken with real anxiety for they had all
come to love the solitary waiting husband Athalia abashed but still
cherishing the dear insult of having been tempted took what little part
Eldress allowed her in the care of the sick man but in the six or seven
weeks of his illness Brother Nathan and the Eldress were his devoted
nurses and byandby a genuine friendship grew up between them Old
Eldress Hannahs shrewd goodhumor was as wholesome as a sound winter
apple and Nathan had a gayety Lewis had never suspected The old man
grew very confidential in those days of Lewiss convalescence he showed
his simple heart with a generosity that made the sick mans lip tighten
once or twice and his eyes blurLewis came to know all about Sister
Lydia indeed he knew more than the old man knew himself When the
invalid grew stronger Nathan wrestled with him over the Prophecies and
Lewis studied them and the other foundationstones of the Shaker faith
with a constantly increasing anxiety Because he said with a nervous
blink if you ARE right But he left the sentence unfinished Once
he said with a feeble passionfor he was still very weakI tell
you Nathan it isnt human and then added under his breath but God
knows whether thats not in its favor


When he was quite well again he was plainly preoccupied He pored
over the Prophecies with a concentration that made him blind even to
Athalias tired looks Once when some one said in his presence Sister
Thalia is working too hard he blinked at her in an absent way before
the old anxious attention awoke in his eyes

Athalia tossed her head and said Brother Lewis has his own affairs to
think of I guess

And he said eagerly Yes Thalia I have been thinkingSome day Ill
tell you But not yet

Oh I havent time to pry into other peoples thoughts she said
acidly And indeed just then her time was very full She was
enormously useful to the community that second winter her young power
and strength shone out against the growing weariness of the old sisters
Athalias capable Eldress Hannah said and the other sisters said
Yee and smiled at one another

She IS useful Sister Jane declared do you know she got through the
churning before nine Id a been at it until eleven

Athalia is like one of those candles that have a streak of soft wax in
em Eldress Hannah murmured but shes useful as you say Jane

In January when the Eldress fell ill Athalia was especially useful
She nursed her with a passion of faithfulness that made the other
sisters remonstrate

Youll wear yourself out Athalia you havent had your clothes off for
three days and nights

The Lord has upheld me and His right hand has sustained me Athalia
quoted with an uplifted look

Yee old Jane assented but He likes sense Athalia and there
aint any reason why two of us shouldnt take turns settin up with her
tonight

This is my service Athalia said smiling joyously

Eldress Hannah lying with closed eyes said suddenly Athalia dont
be foolish and conceited You go right along to your bed Jane and
Maryll look after me

It took Athalia a perceptible minute to get herself in hand sufficiently
to say meekly Yee Eldress When she had shut the door behind her
with perhaps something more than Shaker emphasis the Eldress opened her
eyes and smiled at old Jane Shes smart she said

Yee said Sister Jane and there was a little chuckle

The sick woman closed her eyes again and sighed What a nurse Lydia
was she said and added suddenly How is Nathan getting along with
Lewis There isnt much more time I guess she ended mildly she
wont last it out another summer

Shes done better than I expected to stay till now Jane said and the
Eldress nodded

But it was perhaps a natural result of Athalias abounding energy that
toward the end of that second winter in the Shaker village she should
grow irritable The spring work was very heavy that year Brother
William was too feeble to do even the light pottering tasks that had
been allotted to him and his vague babblings about the spirits ceased
altogether In April old Jane died and that put extra burdens on
Athalias capable shoulders But I notice I dont get anything extra
for my work not even thanks she told Lewis sharply and forgot to
call him Brother She had walked down Lonely Lake Road and stopped at
his gate She looked thinner her forgetmenot eyes were clouded
and there was an impatient line about her lips instead of the faint
ecstatic smile which was part of her early experience

Yes theres lots of work to be done he agreed but when people do
it together

What do you thinkshe interrupted him her lip drooping a little in
a halfcontemptuous smiletheyve heard again from that Sister Lydia
who ran away You know who I meanBrother Nathan is always talking
about her They think shell come back _I_ should say good riddance
Though of course if its genuine repentance Ill be glad Only I dont
think it is

How pleased Nathan will be Lewis said

Oh hes pleased hes rather too pleased for a Shaker it strikes me

Lewis frowned There is joy in the presence of the angels he reminded
her gravely

Angels she said with a laugh I dont believe so much in the angels
as I did before I knew so much about them I understand that when
this angel comes back I am to give up my room to her if you please
because it used to be hers Oh Im of no importance nowLewis she
broke off suddenly who has our house this year

Davis he wants to release it in May

He just takes it by the year doesnt he she asked

He nodded Wants a fiveyears lease next time

Well dont give it to him she said and added frowning You ought
to go back yourself you know Its foolish for you to be here Why
its almost two years

Time flies he said smiling

She laughed and sighed YesI mean yeeindeed it does I was just
thinking Lewis weve been married ten years

No eight years We were married just eight years he said soberly

The color flew into her face Oh yee we were married eight years when
I came in

He looked at her with great tenderness Athalia I have to confess
to you that when you came I didnt think it would last with you I
distrusted the Holy Spirit And I came myself against my will as you
know But now I begin to think you were ledand perhaps you have led
me

Athalia gave a little gaspWHAT

I am not sure yet he said

You said Shakerism was unhuman Athalia protested with a thrill of
panic in her voice

Ah he cried his voice suddenly kindling you know what Nathan is
always sayingThats not against it Athalia its unhumanness as
you call it is why I think it may be of God The human in us must give
way to the divine First that which is natural then that which is
spiritual

Idont understand she said faintly you are not a Shaker

No he said not yet But perhaps some dayI am trying to follow
you Athalia

She caught her breath with a frightened look FollowME Then she
burst out crying

Why Tay he said bewildered what is it dear But she had left
him stumbling blindly as she walked her face hidden in her hands

Lewis went back into his house and lighting his lamp sat down to pore
over one of Brother Nathans books He was concerned but he smiled a
little it was so like Athalia to cry when she was happy He did not see
his wife for several days The Eldress said Sister Thalia was not well
and Lewis looked sorry but made no comment He was a little anxious
but he did not dwell upon his anxiety In the next few days he worked
hard all day in Brother Nathans herbhouse where the air was hazy with
the aromatic dust of tansy and pennyroyal then hurried home at night to
sit down to his books so profoundly absorbed in them that sometimes he
only knew that it was time to sleep because the dawn fell white across
the blacklettered page

But one night a week later when he came home from work he did not
open his Bible he stood a long time in his doorway looking at the
sunset and as he looked his face seemed to shine with some inner
light The lake was like glass high in the upper heavens thin golden
lines of cloud had turned to rippling copper the sky behind the black
circle of the hills was a clear pale green and in the growing dusk the
water whitened like snow Glass mingled with fire he murmured to
himself yes great and marvellous are Thy works Lord God Almighty
just and true are Thy ways Thou King of Saints And what more
marvellous work than this wonder of his own salvation Brought here
against his will against his judgment How he had struggled against the
Spirit He was humbled to the earth at the remembrance of it if I
had my way we wouldnt have walked up the hill from the station that
morning

The flushing heavens faded into ashes but the solemn glow of
halfastonished gratitude lingered on his face

Lewis some one said in the darkness of the laneLEWIS Athalia
came up the path swiftly and put her hands on his arm Lewis II want
to go home She sobbed as she spoke

He started as if she had struck him

Lewis Lewis let us go home

The flame of mystical satisfaction went out of his face as a lighted
candle goes out in the wind

There isnt any home now Athalia he said with a sombre look
theres only a house Come in he added heavily we must talk this
out

She followed him and for a moment they neither of them spoke he
fumbled about in the warm darkness for a match and lifting the shade
lighted the lamp on the table then he looked at her Athalia he
said in a terrified voice I am_I am a Shaker_

Nonono she said She grew very white and sat down breathing
quickly Then the color came back faintly into her lips Dont say it
Lewis it isnt true It cant be true

It is true he said with a groan He had sunk into a chair and
his face was hidden in his hands What are we going to do he said
hoarsely

Why you mustnt be she cried you cant bethats all You cant
STAY if I go

I must stay he said

There was a stunned silence Then she said in an amazed whisper

What You dont love me any more

Still he was silent

Youdontloveme she said as if repeating some astounding fact
which she could not yet believe

He seemed to gather his courage up

I have he tried to speak faltered broke went on I havethe
kindliest feelings toward you Thaliahis last word was in a whisper

Stop she protested with a frightened lookoh stopdont say
THAT He did not speak and suddenly looking at his fixed face she
cried out violently Oh why why did I go up to the graveyard that
day Why did you let me She stared at him her forgetmenot eyes
dilating with dismay It all came from that If we hadnt walked up the
hill that morning He was speechless Then abruptly she sprang to
her feet and running to him knelt beside him and tried to pull down
the hands in which he had again hidden his face Lewis its ITay
You dont feel kindly to ME Lewis you havent stopped loving me

I am a Shaker he said helplessly I cant give up my religion even
for you

He got on his feet and stood before her his empty palms hanging at his
sides in that strange gesture of entire hopelessness he tried to speak
but no words came The lamp on the table flickered a little Their
shadows loomed gigantic on the wall behind them the little hot room was
very still

You think you dont love me Athalia said between set teeth _I know
better_ With a laugh she caught his arm with both her shaking hands
and kissed him once and then again Still he was silent Then with
a cry she threw herself against his breast I love you she said
passionately and you love me Nothing on earth will make me believe
you dont love meand for one vital moment her lips burned against
his

His arms did not close about herbut his hands clinched slightly Then
he moved back a step or two and she heard him sigh Dont sister he
said gently

She threw up her hands with a frantic gesture SISTER My God she
said and left him

    


There was no further struggle between them A week later she went away
As he told her the house was thereand to that she went until she
should go to find some whirl of life that would make her deaf to voices
of the past

As for Lewis he did not see that miserable departure from the Family
House in the shabby old carryall that had been the Shakers one
vehicle for more than thirty years He told Nathan he wanted to mow the
burialground up on the hill that morning From that high and silent
spot he could see the long white road up from the settlement on one
side and down to the covered bridge on the other side He sat under the
pinetree his scythe against the stone wall behind him his clinched
hands between his knees Sitting thus he watched the road and the
slow crawl of the shaky old carriage  After it had passed the
buryingground and was out of sight he hid his face in his bent elbow


It was some ten years afterward that word came to Eldress Hannah that
Athalia Hall was dying and wanted to see her husband would he come to
her

Will you go Brother Lewis Eldress asked him doubtfully

Yee if you think best he said

I do think best the old woman said

He went a bent elderly man in a gray coat threading his wavering way
through the noisy buffet of the streets of the city where Athalia had
elected to dwell He found her in a gaudy hotel full of the glare of
pushing hurrying life He sat down at her bedside a little breathless
and looked at her with mild remote eyes

Do you forgive me Lewis she said

I have nothing to forgive sister he told her

Dont call me that she cried with feeble passion

He looked a little bewildered Yee he said I forgive you

Oh LewisLewisLewis she mourned this is what I have done
She wept pitifully His face grew vaguely troubled as if he did not
quite understand Then abruptly the veil lifted his eyes dilated
with pain he passed his hand over his forehead once or twice and
sighed Then he looked down at the poor dying face that once he had
loved

Why Thalia he said in a surprised and anguished voice suddenly
he put his arm under the restless head There there little Tay dont
cry he said and smiled at her

And with that she was content to fall asleep
