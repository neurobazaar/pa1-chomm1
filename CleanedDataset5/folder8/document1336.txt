SHELLEY AN ESSAY


The Church which was once the mother of poets no less than of saints
during the last two centuries has relinquished to aliens the chief
glories of poetry if the chief glories of holiness she has preserved for
her own The palm and the laurel Dominic and Dante sanctity and song
grew together in her soil she has retained the palm but forgone the
laurel Poetry in its widest sense 1 and when not professedly
irreligious has been too much and too long among many Catholics either
misprised or distrusted too much and too generally the feeling has been
that it is at best superfluous at worst pernicious most often
dangerous Once poetry was as she should be the lesser sister and
helpmate of the Church the minister to the mind as the Church to the
soul But poetry sinned poetry fell and in place of lovingly
reclaiming her Catholicism cast her from the door to follow the feet of
her pagan seducer The separation has been ill for poetry it has not
been well for religion

Fathers of the Church we would say pastors of the Church pious laics
of the Church you are taking from its walls the panoply of Aquinastake
also from its walls the psaltery of Alighieri Unroll the precedents of
the Churchs past recall to your minds that Francis of Assisi was among
the precursors of Dante that sworn to Poverty he forswore not Beauty
but discerned through the lamp Beauty the Light God that he was even
more a poet in his miracles than in his melody that poetry clung round
the cowls of his Order Follow his footsteps you who have blessings for
men have you no blessing for the birds Recall to your memory that in
their minor kind the love poems of Dante shed no less honour on
Catholicism than did the great religious poem which is itself pivoted on
love that in singing of heaven he sang of Beatricethis supporting
angel was still carven on his harp even when he stirred its strings in
Paradise What you theoretically know vividly realise that with many
the religion of beauty must always be a passion and a power that it is
only evil when divorced from the worship of the Primal Beauty Poetry is
the preacher to men of the earthly as you of the Heavenly Fairness of
that earthly fairness which God has fashioned to His own image and
likeness You proclaim the day which the Lord has made and Poetry
exults and rejoices in it You praise the Creator for His works and she
shows you that they are very good Beware how you misprise this potent
ally for hers is the art of Giotto and Dante beware how you misprise
this insidious foe for hers is the art of modern France and of Byron
Her value if you know it not God knows and know the enemies of God If
you have no room for her beneath the wings of the Holy One there is
place for her beneath the webs of the Evil One whom you discard he
embraces whom you cast down from an honourable seat he will advance to
a haughty throne the brows you dislaurel of a just respect he will bind
with baleful splendours the stone which you builders reject he will
make his head of the corner May she not prophesy in the temple then
there is ready for her the tripod of Delphi Eye her not askance if she
seldom sing directly of religion the bird gives glory to God though it
sings only of its innocent loves Suspicion creates its own cause
distrust begets reason for distrust This beautiful wild feline
Poetry wild because left to range the wilds restore to the hearth of
your charity shelter under the rafter of your Faith discipline her to
the sweet restraints of your household feed her with the meat from your
table soften her with the amity of your children tame her fondle her
cherish heryou will no longer then need to flee her Suffer her to
wanton suffer her to play so she play round the foot of the Cross

There is a change of late years the Wanderer is being called to her
Fathers house but we would have the call yet louder we would have the
proffered welcome more unstinted There are still stray remnants of the
old intolerant distrust It is still possible for even a French
historian of the Church to enumerate among the articles cast upon
Savonarolas famous pile _poesies erotiques tant des anciens que des
modernes livres impies ou corrupteurs Ovide Tibulle Properce pour ne
nommer que les plus connus Dante Petrarque Boccace tous ces auteurs
Italiens qui deja souillaient les ames et ruinaient les moeurs en creant
ou perfectionnant la langue_ 2 Blameworthy carelessness at the least
which can class the _Vita Nuova_ with the _Ars Amandi_ and the
_Decameron_ And among many English Catholics the spirit of poetry is
still often received with a restricted Puritanical greeting rather than
with the traditionally Catholic joyous openness

We ask therefore for a larger interest not in purely Catholic poetry
but in poetry generally poetry in its widest sense With few
exceptions whatsoever in our best poets is great and good to the non
Catholic is great and good also to the Catholic and though Faber threw
his edition of Shelley into the fire and never regretted the act though
moreover Shelley is so little read among us that we can still tolerate
in our Churches the religious parody which Faber should have thrown after
his threevolumed Shelley 3in spite of this we are not disposed to
number among such exceptions that straying spirit of light

    

We have among us at the present day no lineal descendant in the poetical
order of Shelley and any such offspring of the aboundingly spontaneous
Shelley is hardly possible still less likely on account of the defect
by which we think contemporary poetry in general as compared with the
poetry of the early nineteenth century is mildewed That defect is the
predominance of art over inspiration of body over soul We do not say
the _defect_ of inspiration The warrior is there but he is hampered by
his armour Writers of high aim in all branches of literature even when
they are notas Mr Swinburne for instance islavish in expression
are generally overdeliberate in expression Mr Henry James
delineating a fictitious writer clearly intended to be the ideal of an
artist makes him regret that he has sometimes allowed himself to take
the secondbest word instead of searching for the best Theoretically
of course one ought always to try for the best word But practically
the habit of excessive care in wordselection frequently results in loss
of spontaneity and still worse the habit of always taking the best
word too easily becomes the habit of always taking the most ornate word
the word most removed from ordinary speech In consequence of this
poetic diction has become latterly a kaleidoscope and ones chief
curiosity is as to the precise combinations into which the pieces will be
shifted There is in fact a certain band of words the Praetorian
cohorts of poetry whose prescriptive aid is invoked by every aspirant to
the poetical purple and without whose prescriptive aid none dares aspire
to the poetical purple against these it is time some banner should be
raised Perhaps it is almost impossible for a contemporary writer quite
to evade the services of the freelances whom one encounters under so
many standards 4 But it is at any rate curious to note that the
literary revolution against the despotic diction of Pope seems issuing
like political revolutions in a despotism of its own making

This then we cannot but think distinguishes the literary period of
Shelley from our own It distinguishes even the unquestionable treasures
and masterpieces of today from similar treasures and masterpieces of the
precedent day even _the LotusEaters_ from _KublaKhan_ even Rossettis
ballads from _Christabel_ It is present in the restraint of Matthew
Arnold no less than in the exuberance of Swinburne and affects our
writers who aim at simplicity no less than those who seek richness
Indeed nothing is so artificial as our simplicity It is the simplicity
of the French stage _ingenue_ We are selfconscious to the fingertips
and this inherent quality entailing on our poetry the inevitable loss of
spontaneity ensures that whatever poets of whatever excellence may be
born to us from the Shelleian stock its founders spirit can take among
us no reincarnation An age that is ceasing to produce childlike
children cannot produce a Shelley For both as poet and man he was
essentially a child

Yet just as in the effete French society before the Revolution the Queen
played at Arcadia the King played at being a mechanic everyone played
at simplicity and universal philanthropy leaving for most durable
outcome of their philanthropy the guillotine as the most durable outcome
of ours may be execution by electricityso in our own society the talk
of benevolence and the cult of childhood are the very fashion of the
hour We of this selfconscious incredulous generation sentimentalise
our children analyse our children think we are endowed with a special
capacity to sympathise and identify ourselves with children we play at
being children And the result is that we are not more childlike but
our children are less childlike It is so tiring to stoop to the child
so much easier to lift the child up to you Know you what it is to be a
child It is to be something very different from the man of today It
is to have a spirit yet streaming from the waters of baptism it is to
believe in love to believe in loveliness to believe in belief it is to
be so little that the elves can reach to whisper in your ear it is to
turn pumpkins into coaches and mice into horses lowness into loftiness
and nothing into everything for each child has its fairy godmother in
its own soul it is to live in a nutshell and to count yourself the king
of infinite space it is

 To see a world in a grain of sand
 And a heaven in a wild flower
 Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
 And eternity in an hour

it is to know not as yet that you are under sentence of life nor
petition that it be commuted into death When we become conscious in
dreaming that we dream the dream is on the point of breaking when we
become conscious in living that we live the ill dream is but just
beginning Now if Shelley was but too conscious of the dream in other
respects Drydens false and famous line might have been applied to him
with very much less than its usual untruth 5 To the last in a
degree uncommon even among poets he retained the idiosyncrasy of
childhood expanded and matured without differentiation To the last he
was the enchanted child

This was as is well known patent in his life It is as really though
perhaps less obviously manifest in his poetry the sincere effluence of
his life And it may not therefore be amiss to consider whether it was
conditioned by anything beyond his congenital nature For our part we
believe it to have been equally largely the outcome of his early and long
isolation Men given to retirement and abstract study are notoriously
liable to contract a certain degree of childlikeness and if this be the
case when we segregate a man how much more when we segregate a child It
is when they are taken into the solution of schoollife that children by
the reciprocal interchange of influence with their fellows undergo the
series of reactions which converts them from children into boys and from
boys into men The intermediate stage must be traversed to reach the
final one

Now Shelley never could have been a man for he never was a boy And the
reason lay in the persecution which overclouded his schooldays Of that
persecutions effect upon him he has left us in _The Revolt of Islam_
a picture which to many or most people very probably seems a poetical
exaggeration partly because Shelley appears to have escaped physical
brutality partly because adults are inclined to smile tenderly at
childish sorrows which are not caused by physical suffering That he
escaped for the most part bodily violence is nothing to the purpose It
is the petty malignant annoyance recurring hour by hour day by day
month by month until its accumulation becomes an agony it is this which
is the most terrible weapon that boys have against their fellow boy who
is powerless to shun it because unlike the man he has virtually no
privacy His is the torture which the ancients used when they anointed
their victim with honey and exposed him naked to the restless fever of
the flies He is a little St Sebastian sinking under the incessant
flight of shafts which skilfully avoid the vital parts

We do not therefore suspect Shelley of exaggeration he was no doubt
in terrible misery Those who think otherwise must forget their own
past Most people we suppose _must_ forget what they were like when
they were children otherwise they would know that the griefs of their
childhood were passionate abandonment _dechirants_ to use a
characteristically favourite phrase of modern French literature as the
griefs of their maturity Childrens griefs are little certainly but
so is the child so is its endurance so is its field of vision while
its nervous impressionability is keener than ours Grief is a matter of
relativity the sorrow should be estimated by its proportion to the
sorrower a gash is as painful to one as an amputation to another Pour
a puddle into a thimble or an Atlantic into Etna both thimble and
mountain overflow Adult fools would not the angels smile at our
griefs were not angels too wise to smile at them

So beset the child fled into the tower of his own soul and raised the
drawbridge He threw out a reserve encysted in which he grew to
maturity unaffected by the intercourses that modify the maturity of
others into the thing we call a man The encysted child developed until
it reached years of virility until those later Oxford days in which Hogg
encountered it then bursting at once from its cyst and the university
it swam into a world not illegitimately perplexed by such a whim of the
gods It was of course only the completeness and duration of this
seclusionlasting from the gate of boyhood to the threshold of
youthwhich was peculiar to Shelley Most poets probably like most
saints are prepared for their mission by an initial segregation as the
seed is buried to germinate before they can utter the oracle of poetry
they must first be divided from the body of men It is the severed head
that makes the seraph

Shelleys life frequently exhibits in him the magnified child It is
seen in his fondness for apparently futile amusements such as the
sailing of paper boats This was in the truest sense of the word child
like not as it is frequently called and considered childish That is
to say it was not a mindless triviality but the genuine childs power
of investing little things with imaginative interest the same power
though differently devoted which produced much of his poetry Very
possibly in the paper boat he saw the magic bark of Laon and Cythna or

 That thinnest boat
 In which the mother of the months is borne
 By ebbing night into her western cave

In fact if you mark how favourite an idea under varying forms is this
in his verse you will perceive that all the charmed boats which glide
down the stream of his poetry are but glorified resurrections of the
little paper argosies which trembled down the Isis

And the child appeared no less often in Shelley the philosopher than in
Shelley the idler It is seen in his repellent no less than in his
amiable weaknesses in the unteachable folly of a love that made its goal
its startingpoint and firmly expected spiritual rest from each new
divinity though it had found none from the divinities antecedent For
we are clear that this was no mere straying of sensual appetite but a
straying strange and deplorable of the spirit that contrary to what
Mr Coventry Patmore has said he left a woman not because he was tired
of her arms but because he was tired of her soul When he found Mary
Shelley wanting he seems to have fallen into the mistake of Wordsworth
who complained in a charming piece of unreasonableness that his wifes
love which had been a fountain was now only a well

 Such change and at the very door
 Of my fond heart hath made me poor

Wordsworth probably learned what Shelley was incapable of learning that
love can never permanently be a fountain A living poet in an article
6 which you almost fear to breathe upon lest you should flutter some of
the frail pastellike bloom has said the thing Love itself has tidal
moments lapses and flows due to the metrical rule of the interior
heart Elementary reason should proclaim this true Love is an
affection its display an emotion love is the air its display is the
wind An affection may be constant an emotion can no more be constant
than the wind can constantly blow All therefore that a man can
reasonably ask of his wife is that her love should be indeed a well A
well but a Bethesdawell into which from time to time the angel of
tenderness descends to trouble the waters for the healing of the beloved
Such a love Shelleys second wife appears unquestionably to have given
him Nay she was content that he should veer while she remained true
she companioned him intellectually shared his views entered into his
aspirations and yetyet even at the date of _Epipsychidion_ the
foolish child her husband assigned her the part of moon to Emilia
Vivianis sun and lamented that he was barred from final certain
irreversible happiness by a cold and callous society Yet few poets were
so mated before and no poet was so mated afterwards until Browning
stooped and picked up a faircoined soul that lay rusting in a pool of
tears

In truth his very unhappiness and discontent with life in so far as it
was not the inevitable penalty of the ethical anarch can only be
ascribed to this same childlike irrationalitythough in such a form it
is irrationality hardly peculiar to Shelley Pity if you will his
spiritual ruins and the neglected early training which was largely their
cause but the pity due to his outward circumstances has been strangely
exaggerated The obloquy from which he suffered he deliberately and
wantonly courted For the rest his lot was one that many a young poet
might envy He had faithful friends a faithful wife an income small
but assured Poverty never dictated to his pen the designs on his
bright imagination were never etched by the sharp fumes of necessity

If as has chanced to othersas chanced for example to Manganoutcast
from home health and hope with a charred past and a bleared future an
anchorite without detachment and selfcloistered without
selfsufficingness deposed from a world which he had not abdicated
pierced with thorns which formed no crown a poet hopeless of the bays
and a martyr hopeless of the palm a land cursed against the dews of
love an exile banned and proscribed even from the innocent arms of
childhoodhe were burning helpless at the stake of his unquenchable
heart then he might have been inconsolable then might he have cast the
gorge at life then have cowered in the darkening chamber of his being
tapestried with mouldering hopes and hearkened to the winds that swept
across the illimitable wastes of death But no such hapless lot was
Shelleys as that of his own contemporariesKeats half chewed in the
jaws of London and spit dying on to Italy de Quincey who if he
escaped escaped rent and maimed from those cruel jaws Coleridge whom
they dully mumbled for the major portion of his life Shelley had
competence poetry love yet he wailed that he could lie down like a
tired child and weep away his life of care Is it ever so with you sad
brother is it ever so with me and is there no drinking of pearls except
they be dissolved in biting tears Which of us has his desire or
having it is satisfied

It is true that he shared the fate of nearly all the great poets
contemporary with him in being unappreciated Like them he suffered
from critics who were for ever shearing the wild tresses of poetry
between rusty rules who could never see a literary bough project beyond
the trim level of its day but they must lop it with a crooked criticism
who kept indomitably planting in the defile of fame the established
canons that had been spiked by poet after poet But we decline to
believe that a singer of Shelleys calibre could be seriously grieved by
want of vogue Not that we suppose him to have found consolation in that
senseless superstition the applause of posterity Posterity
posterity which goes to Rome weeps largesized tears carves beautiful
inscriptions over the tomb of Keats and the worm must wriggle her
curtsey to it all since the dead boy wherever he be has quite other
gear to tend Never a bone less dry for all the tears

A poet must to some extent be a chameleon and feed on air But it need
not be the musty breath of the multitude He can find his needful
support in the judgement of those whose judgement he knows valuable and
such support Shelley had

 La gloire
 Ne compte pas toujours les voix
 Elle les pese quelquefois

Yet if this might be needful to him as support neither this nor the
applause of the present nor the applause of posterity could have been
needful to him as motive the one allsufficing motive for a great poets
singing is that expressed by Keats

 I was taught in Paradise
 To ease my breast of melodies

Precisely so The overcharged breast can find no ease but in suckling
the babysong No enmity of outward circumstances therefore but his
own nature was responsible for Shelleys doom

A being with so much about it of childlike unreasonableness and yet
withal so much of the beautiful attraction luminous in a childs sweet
unreasonableness would seem forefated by its very essence to the
transience of the bubble and the rainbow of all things filmy and fair
Did some shadow of this destiny bear part in his sadness Certain it is
that by a curious chance he himself in _Julian and Maddalo_ jestingly
foretold the manner of his end O ho You talk as in years past said
Maddalo Byron to Julian Shelley If you cant swim Beware of
Providence Did no unearthly _dixisti_ sound in his ears as he wrote
it But a brief while and Shelley who could not swim was weltering on
the waters of Lerici We know not how this may affect others but over
us it is a coincidence which has long tyrannised with an absorbing
inveteracy of impression strengthened rather than diminished by the
contrast between the levity of the utterance and its fatal
fulfilmentthus to behold heralding itself in warning mockery through
the very lips of its predestined victim the Doom upon whose breath his
locks were lifting along the coasts of Campania The death which he had
prophesied came upon him and Spezzia enrolled another name among the
mournful Marcelli of our tongue Venetian glasses which foamed and burst
before the poisoned wine of life had risen to their brims

    

Coming to Shelleys poetry we peep over the wild mask of revolutionary
metaphysics and we see the winsome face of the child Perhaps none of
his poems is more purely and typically Shelleian than _The Cloud_ and it
is interesting to note how essentially it springs from the faculty of
makebelieve The same thing is conspicuous though less purely
conspicuous throughout his singing it is the childs faculty of make
believe raised to the nth power He is still at play save only that his
play is such as manhood stops to watch and his playthings are those
which the gods give their children The universe is his box of toys He
dabbles his fingers in the dayfall He is golddusty with tumbling
amidst the stars He makes bright mischief with the moon The meteors
nuzzle their noses in his hand He teases into growling the kennelled
thunder and laughs at the shaking of its fiery chain He dances in and
out of the gates of heaven its floor is littered with his broken
fancies He runs wild over the fields of ether He chases the rolling
world He gets between the feet of the horses of the sun He stands in
the lap of patient Nature and twines her loosened tresses after a hundred
wilful fashions to see how she will look nicest in his song

This it was which in spite of his essentially modern character as a
singer qualified Shelley to be the poet of _Prometheus Unbound_ for it
made him in the truest sense of the word a mythological poet This
childlike quality assimilated him to the childlike peoples among whom
mythologies have their rise Those Nature myths which according to
many are the basis of all mythology are likewise the very basis of
Shelleys poetry The lark that is the gossip of heaven the winds that
pluck the grey from the beards of the billows the clouds that are
snorted from the seas broad nostril all the elemental spirits of
Nature take from his verse perpetual incarnation and reincarnation pass
in a thousand glorious transmigrations through the radiant forms of his
imagery

Thus but not in the Wordsworthian sense he is a veritable poet of
Nature For with Nature the Wordsworthians will admit no tampering they
exact the direct interpretative reproduction of her that the poet should
follow her as a mistress not use her as a handmaid To such following
of Nature Shelley felt no call He saw in her not a picture set for his
copying but a palette set for his brush not a habitation prepared for
his inhabiting but a Coliseum whence he might quarry stones for his own
palaces Even in his descriptive passages the dreamcharacter of his
scenery is notorious it is not the clear recognisable scenery of
Wordsworth but a landscape that hovers athwart the heat and haze arising
from his crackling fantasies The materials for such visionary Edens
have evidently been accumulated from direct experience but they are
recomposed by him into such scenes as never had mortal eye beheld Dont
you wish you had as Turner said The one justification for classing
Shelley with the Lake poet is that he loved Nature with a love even more
passionate though perhaps less profound Wordsworths _Nightingale and
Stockdove_ sums up the contrast between the two as though it had been
written for such a purpose Shelley is the creature of ebullient
heart who

 Sings as if the god of wine
 Had helped him to a valentine

Wordsworths is the

 Love with quiet blending
 Slow to begin and never ending

the serious faith and inward glee

But if Shelley instead of culling Nature crossed with its pollen the
blossoms of his own soul that Babylonian garden is his marvellous and
best apology For astounding figurative opulence he yields only to
Shakespeare and even to Shakespeare not in absolute fecundity but in
images The sources of his figurative wealth are specialised sources of
Shakespeares are universal It would have been as conscious an effort
for him to speak without figure as it is for most men to speak with
figure Suspended in the dripping well of his imagination the commonest
object becomes encrusted with imagery Herein again he deviates from the
true Nature poet the normal Wordsworth type of Nature poet imagery was
to him not a mere means of expression not even a mere means of
adornment it was a delight for its own sake

And herein we find the trail by which we would classify him He belongs
to a school of which not impossibly he may hardly have read a linethe
Metaphysical School To a large extent he _is_ what the Metaphysical
School should have been That school was a certain kind of poetry trying
for a range Shelley is the range found Crashaw and Shelley sprang
from the same seed but in the one case the seed was choked with thorns
in the other case it fell on good ground The Metaphysical School was in
its direct results an abortive movement though indirectly much came of
itfor Dryden came of it Dryden to a greater extent than is we
imagine generally perceived was Cowley systematised and Cowley who
sank into the arms of Dryden rose from the lap of Donne

But the movement was so abortive that few will thank us for connecting
with it the name of Shelley This is because to most people the
Metaphysical School means Donne whereas it ought to mean Crashaw We
judge the direction of a development by its highest form though that
form may have been produced but once and produced imperfectly Now the
highest product of the Metaphysical School was Crashaw and Crashaw was a
Shelley _manque_ he never reached the Promised Land but he had fervid
visions of it The Metaphysical School like Shelley loved imagery for
its own sake and how beautiful a thing the frank toying with imagery may
be let _The Skylark_ and _The Cloud_ witness It is only evil when the
poet on the straight way to a fixed object lags continually from the
path to play This is commendable neither in poet nor errandboy The
Metaphysical School failed not because it toyed with imagery but
because it toyed with it frostily To sport with the tangles of Neaeras
hair may be trivial idleness or caressing tenderness exactly as your
relation to Neaera is that of heartless gallantry or of love So you may
toy with imagery in mere intellectual ingenuity and then you might as
well go write acrostics or you may toy with it in raptures and then you
may write a _Sensitive Plant_ In fact the Metaphysical poets when they
went astray cannot be said to have done anything so dainty as is implied
by _toying_ with imagery They cut it into shapes with a pair of
scissors From all such danger Shelley was saved by his passionate
spontaneity No trappings are too splendid for the swift steeds of
sunrise His swordhilt may be rough with jewels but it is the hilt of
an Excalibur His thoughts scorch through all the folds of expression
His cloth of gold bursts at the flexures and shows the naked poetry

    

It is this gift of not merely embodying but apprehending everything in
figure which cooperates towards creating his rarest characteristics so
almost preternaturally developed in no other poet namely his wellknown
power to condense the most hydrogenic abstraction Science can now educe
threads of such exquisite tenuity that only the feet of the tiniest
infantspiders can ascend them but up the filmiest insubstantiality
Shelley runs with agile ease To him in truth nothing is abstract The
dustiest abstractions

 Start and tremble under his feet
 And blossom in purple and red

The coldest moon of an idea rises haloed through his vaporous
imagination The dimmestsparked chip of a conception blazes and
scintillates in the subtile oxygen of his mind The most wrinkled AEson
of an abstruseness leaps rosy out of his bubbling genius In a more
intensified signification than it is probable that Shakespeare dreamed
of Shelley gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name Here
afresh he touches the Metaphysical School whose very title was drawn
from this habitual pursuit of abstractions and who failed in that
pursuit from the one cause omnipresent with them because in all their
poetic smithy they had left never a place for a forge They laid their
fancies chill on the anvil Crashaw indeed partially anticipated
Shelleys success and yet further did a later poet so much further that
we find it difficult to understand why a generation that worships Shelley
should be reviving Gray yet almost forget the name of Collins The
generality of readers when they know him at all usually know him by his
_Ode on the Passions_ In this despite its beauty there is still a
_soupcon_ of formalism a lingering trace of powder from the eighteenth
century periwig dimming the bright locks of poetry Only the literary
student reads that little masterpiece the _Ode to Evening_ which
sometimes heralds the Shelleian strain while other passages are the sole
things in the language comparable to the miniatures of _Il Penseroso_
Crashaw Collins Shelleythree ricochets of the one pebble three jets
from three bounds of the one Pegasus Collinss Pity with eyes of dewy
light is near of kin to Shelleys Sleep the filmyeyed and the
shadowy tribes of mind are the lineal progenitors of Thoughts crowned
powers This however is personification wherein both Collins and
Shelley build on Spenser the dizzying achievement to which the modern
poet carried personification accounts for but a moiety if a large
moiety of his vivifying power over abstractions Take the passage
already alluded to in that glorious chorus telling how the Hours come

 From the temples high
 Of mans ear and eye
 Roofed over Sculpture and Poesy

     

 From those skiey towers
 Where Thoughts crowned powers
 Sit watching your dance ye happy Hours
 Our feet now every palm
 Are sandalled with calm
 And the dew of our wings is a rain of balm
 And beyond our eyes
 The human love lies
 Which makes all it gazes on Paradise

Any partial explanation will break in our hands before it reaches the
root of such a power The root we take it is this He had an
instinctive perception immense in range and fertility astonishing for
its delicate intuition of the underlying analogies the secret
subterranean passages between matter and soul the chromatic scales
whereat we dimly guess by which the Almighty modulates through all the
keys of creation Because the more we consider it the more likely does
it appear that Nature is but an imperfect actress whose constant changes
of dress never change her manner and method who is the same in all her
parts

To Shelleys ethereal vision the most rarified mental or spiritual music
traced its beautiful corresponding forms on the sand of outward things
He stood thus at the very junctionlines of the visible and invisible
and could shift the points as he willed His thoughts became a mounted
infantry passing with baffling swiftness from horse to foot or foot to
horse He could express as he listed the material and the immaterial in
terms of each other Never has a poet in the past rivalled him as
regards this gift and hardly will any poet rival him as regards it in
the future men are like first to see the promised doom lay its hand on
the tree of heaven and shake down the golden leaves 7

The finest specimens of this faculty are probably to be sought in that
Shelleian treasury _Prometheus Unbound_ It is unquestionably the
greatest and most prodigal exhibition of Shelleys powers this amazing
lyric world where immortal clarities sigh past in the perfumes of the
blossoms populate the breathings of the breeze throng and twinkle in
the leaves that twirl upon the bough where the very grass is all
arustle with lovely spiritthings and a weeping mist of music fills the
air The final scenes especially are such a Bacchic reel and rout and
revelry of beauty as leaves one staggered and giddy poetry is spilt like
wine music runs to drunken waste The choruses sweep down the wind
tirelessly flight after flight till the breathless soul almost cries
for respite from the unrolling splendours Yet these scenes so
wonderful from a purely poetical standpoint that no one could wish them
away are to our humble thinking nevertheless the artistic error of the
poem Abstractedly the development of Shelleys idea required that he
should show the earthly paradise which was to follow the fall of Zeus
But dramatically with that fall the action ceases and the drama should
have ceased with it A final chorus or choral series of rejoicings
such as does ultimately end the drama where Prometheus appears on the
scene would have been legitimate enough Instead however the
bewildered reader finds the drama unfolding itself through scene after
scene which leaves the action precisely where it found it because there
is no longer an action to advance It is as if the choral _finale_ of an
opera were prolonged through two acts

We have nevertheless called _Prometheus_ Shelleys greatest poem
because it is the most comprehensive storehouse of his power Were we
asked to name the most _perfect_ among his longer efforts we should name
the poem in which he lamented Keats under the shed petals of his lovely
fancy giving the slain bird a silken burial Seldom is the death of a
poet mourned in true poetry Not often is the singer coffined in laurel
wood Among the very few exceptions to such a rule the greatest is
_Adonais_ In the English language only _Lycidas_ competes with it and
when we prefer _Adonais_ to _Lycidas_ we are following the precedent set
in the case of Cicero _Adonais_ is the longer As regards command over
abstraction it is no less characteristically Shelleian than
_Prometheus_ It is throughout a series of abstractions vitalised with
daring exquisiteness from Morning who sought

 Her eastern watchtower and her hair unbound
 Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground

and who

 Dimmed the aerial eyes that kindle day

to the Dreams that were the flock of the dead shepherd the Dreams

 Whom near the living streams
 Of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught
 The love that was its music

of whom one sees as she hangs mourning over him

 Upon the silken fringe of his faint eyes
 Like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies
 A tear some dream has loosened from his brain
 Lost angel of a ruined Paradise
 She knew not twas her own as with no stain
 She faded like a cloud which hath outwept its rain

In the solar spectrum beyond the extreme red and extreme violet rays
are whole series of colours demonstrable but imperceptible to gross
human vision Such writing as this we have quoted renders visible the
invisibilities of imaginative colour

One thing prevents _Adonais_ from being ideally perfect its lack of
Christian hope Yet we remember well the writer of a popular memoir on
Keats proposing as the best consolation for the mind pained by this sad
record Shelleys inexpressibly sad exposition of Pantheistic
immortality

 He is a portion of the loveliness
 Which once he made more lovely _etc_

What desolation can it be that discerns comfort in this hope whose wan
countenance is as the countenance of a despair What deepest depth of
agony is it that finds consolation in this immortality an immortality
which thrusts you into death the maw of Nature that your dissolved
elements may circulate through her veins

Yet such the poet tells me is my sole balm for the hurts of life I am
as the vocal breath floating from an organ I too shall fade on the
winds a cadence soon forgotten So I dissolve and die and am lost in
the ears of men the particles of my being twine in newer melodies and
from my one death arise a hundred lives Why through the thin partition
of this consolation Pantheism can hear the groans of its neighbour
Pessimism Better almost the black resignation which the fatalist draws
from his own hopelessness from the fierce kisses of misery that hiss
against his tears

With some gleams it is true of more than mock solace _Adonais_ is
lighted but they are obtained by implicitly assuming the personal
immortality which the poem explicitly denies as when for instance to
greet the dead youth

 The inheritors of unfulfilled renown
 Rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought
 Far in the unapparent

And again the final stanza of the poem

 The breath whose might I have invoked in song
 Descends on me my spirits bark is driven
 Far from the shore far from the trembling throng
 Whose sails were never to the tempest riven
 The massy earth the sphered skies are given
 I am borne darkly fearfully afar
 Whilst burning through the inmost veil of heaven
 The soul of Adonais like a star
 Beacons from the abode where the eternal are

The Soul of AdonaisAdonais who is but

 A portion of the loveliness
 Which once he made more lovely

After all to finish where we began perhaps the poems on which the lover
of Shelley leans most lovingly which he has oftenest in his mind which
best represent Shelley to him and which he instinctively reverts to when
Shelleys name is mentioned are some of the shorter poems and detached
lyrics Here Shelley forgets for a while all that ever makes his verse
turbid forgets that he is anything but a poet forgets sometimes that he
is anything but a child lies back in his skiff and looks at the clouds
He plays truant from earth slips through the wicket of fancy into
heavens meadow and goes gathering stars Here we have that absolute
virgingold of song which is the scarcest among human products and for
which we can go to but three poetsColeridge Shelley Chopin 8 and
perhaps we should add Keats _Christabel_ and _KublaKhan_ _The
Skylark_ _The Cloud_ and _The Sensitive Plant_ in its first two
parts _The Eve of Saint Agnes_ and _The Nightingale_ certain of the
Nocturnesthese things make very quintessentialised loveliness It is
attar of poetry

Remark as a thing worth remarking that although Shelleys diction is
at other times singularly rich it ceases in these poems to be rich or
to obtrude itself at all it is imperceptible his Muse has become a
veritable Echo whose body has dissolved from about her voice Indeed
when his diction is richest nevertheless the poetry so dominates the
expression that we feel the latter only as an atmosphere until we are
satiated with the former then we discover with surprise to how imperial
a vesture we had been blinded by gazing on the face of his song A
lesson this deserving to be conned by a generation so opposite in
tendency as our own a lesson that in poetry as in the Kingdom of God
we should not take thought too greatly wherewith we shall be clothed but
seek first 9 the spirit and all these things will be added unto us

On the marvellous music of Shelleys verse we need not dwell except to
note that he avoids that metronomic beat of rhythm which Edgar Poe
introduced into modern lyric measures as Pope introduced it into the
rhyming heroics of his day Our varied metres are becoming as painfully
overpolished as Popes one metre Shelley could at need sacrifice
smoothness to fitness He could write an anapaest that would send Mr
Swinburne into strong shudders eg stream did glide when he
instinctively felt that by so forgoing the more obvious music of melody
he would better secure the higher music of harmony If we have to add
that in other ways he was far from escaping the defects of his merits
and would sometimes have to acknowledge that his Nilotic flood too often
overflowed its banks what is this but saying that he died young

    

It may be thought that in our casual comments on Shelleys life we have
been blind to its evil side That however is not the case We see
clearly that he committed grave sins and one cruel crime but we
remember also that he was an Atheist from his boyhood we reflect how
gross must have been the moral neglect in the training of a child who
_could_ be an Atheist from his boyhood and we decline to judge so
unhappy a being by the rules which we should apply to a Catholic It
seems to us that Shelley was strugglingblindly weakly stumblingly
but still strugglingtowards higher things His Pantheism is an
indication of it Pantheism is a halfway house and marks ascent or
descent according to the direction from which it is approached Now
Shelley came to it from absolute Atheism therefore in his case it meant
rise Again his poetry alone would lead us to the same conclusion for
we do not believe that a truly corrupted spirit can write consistently
ethereal poetry We should believe in nothing if we believed that for
it would be the consecration of a lie Poetry is a thermometer by
taking its average height you can estimate the normal temperature of its
writers mind The devil can do many things But the devil cannot write
poetry He may mar a poet but he cannot make a poet Among all the
temptations wherewith he tempted St Anthony though we have often seen
it stated that he howled we have never seen it stated that he sang

Shelleys anarchic principles were as a rule held by him with some
misdirected view to truth He disbelieved in kings And is it not a
mere factregret it if you willthat in all European countries except
two monarchs are a mere survival the obsolete buttons on the coattails
of rule which serve no purpose but to be continually coming off It is
a miserable thing to note how every little Balkan State having obtained
liberty save the mark by Act of Congress straightway proceeds to
secure the service of a professional king These gentlemen are plentiful
in Europe They are the noble Chairmen who lend their names for a
consideration to any enterprising company which may be speculating in
Liberty When we see these things we revert to the old lines in which
Persius tells how you cannot turn Dama into a freeman by twirling him
round your finger and calling him Marcus Dama

Again Shelley desired a religion of humanity and that meant to him a
religion for humanity a religion which unlike the spectral Christianity
about him should permeate and regulate the whole organisation of men
And the feeling is one with which a Catholic must sympathise in an age
whenif we may say so without irreverencethe Almighty has been made a
constitutional Deity with certain stategrants of worship but no
influence over political affairs In these matters his aims were
generous if his methods were perniciously mistaken In his theory of
Free Love alone borrowed like the rest from the Revolution his aim was
as mischievous as his method At the same time he was at least logical
His theory was repulsive but comprehensible Whereas from our present
_via media_facilitation of divorcecan only result the era when the
young lady in reduced circumstances will no longer turn governess but
will be open to engagement as wife at a reasonable stipend

We spoke of the purity of Shelleys poetry We know of but three
passages to which exception can be taken One is happily hidden under a
heap of Shelleian rubbish Another is offensive because it presents his
theory of Free Love in its most odious form The third is very much a
matter we think for the individual conscience Compare with this the
genuinely corrupt Byron through the cracks and fissures of whose heaving
versification steam up perpetually the sulphurous vapours from his
central iniquity We cannot credit that any Christian ever had his faith
shaken through reading Shelley unless his faith were shaken before he
read Shelley Is any safely havened bark likely to slip its cable and
make for a flag planted on the very reef where the planter himself was
wrecked

    

Why indeed one is tempted to ask in concluding should it be that the
poets who have written for us the poetry richest in skiey grain most
free from admixture with the duller things of earththe Shelleys the
Coleridges the Keatsare the very poets whose lives are among the
saddest records in literature Is it that by some subtile mystery of
analogy sorrow passion and fantasy are indissolubly connected like
water fire and cloud that as from sun and dew are born the vapours so
from fire and tears ascend the visions of aerial joy that the harvest
waves richest over the battlefields of the soul that the heart like the
earth smells sweetest after rain that the spell on which depend such
necromantic castles is some spirit of pain charmpoisoned at their base
10 Such a poet it may be mists with sighs the window of his life
until the tears run down it then some air of searching poetry like an
air of searching frost turns it to a crystal wonder The god of golden
song is the god too of the golden sun so peradventure songlight is
like sunlight and darkens the countenance of the soul Perhaps the rays
are to the stars what thorns are to the flowers and so the poet after
wandering over heaven returns with bleeding feet Less tragic in its
merely temporal aspect than the life of Keats or Coleridge the life of
Shelley in its moral aspect is perhaps more tragical than that of
either his dying seems a myth a figure of his living the material
shipwreck a figure of the immaterial

Enchanted child born into a world unchildlike spoiled darling of
Nature playmate of her elemental daughters pardlike spirit beautiful
and swift laired amidst the burning fastnesses of his own fervid mind
bold foot along the verges of precipitous dream light leaper from crag
to crag of inaccessible fancies towering Genius whose soul rose like a
ladder between heaven and earth with the angels of song ascending and
descending ithe is shrunken into the little vessel of death and
sealed with the unshatterable seal of doom and cast down deep below the
rolling tides of Time Mighty meat for little guests when the heart of
Shelley was laid in the cemetery of Caius Cestius Beauty music
sweetness tearsthe mouth of the worm has fed of them all Into that
sacred bridalgloom of death where he holds his nuptials with eternity
let not our rash speculations follow him Let us hope rather that as
amidst material nature where our dull eyes see only ruin the finer eye
of science has discovered life in putridity and vigour in decayseeing
dissolution even and disintegration which in the mouth of man symbolise
disorder to be in the works of God undeviating order and the manner of
our corruption to be no less wonderful than the manner of our healthso
amidst the supernatural universe some tender undreamed surprise of life
in doom awaited that wild nature which worn by warfare with itself its
Maker and all the world now

 Sleeps and never palates more the dug
 The beggars nurse and Caesars




FOOTNOTES


1 That is to say taken as the general animating spirit of the Fine
Arts

2 The Abbe Bareille was not of course responsible for Savonarolas
taste only for thus endorsing it

3 We mean of course the hymn I rise from dreams of time

4 We are a little surprised at the fact because so many Victorian
poets are or have been prosewriters as well Now according to our
theory the practice of prose should maintain fresh and comprehensive a
poets diction should save him from falling into the hands of an
exclusive coterie of poetic words It should react upon his metrical
vocabulary to its beneficial expansion by taking him outside his
aristocratic circle of language and keeping him in touch with the great
commonalty the proletariat of speech For it is with words as with men
constant intermarriage within the limits of a patrician clan begets
effete refinement and to reinvigorate the stock its veins must be
replenished from hardy plebeian blood

5 Wordsworths adaptation of it however is true Men are not
children of a larger growth but the child _is_ father of the man
since the parent is only partially reproduced in his offspring

6 _The Rhythm of Life_ by Alice Meynell

7 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a figtree
casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind Rev vi
13

8 Such analogies between master in sisterarts are often interesting
In some respects is not Brahms the Browning of music

9 Seek _first_ not seek _only_

10 We hope that we need not refer the reader for the methods of magic
architecture to Ariosto and that Atlas among enchanters Beckford
