PREFACE


An apology is perhaps needed for the neglect of contrast which is shown
by presenting two consecutive stories of hangmen in such a small
collection as the following But in the neighbourhood of countytowns
tales of executions used to form a large proportion of the local
traditions and though never personally acquainted with any chief
operator at such scenes the writer of these pages had as a boy the
privilege of being on speaking terms with a man who applied for the
office and who sank into an incurable melancholy because he failed to
get it some slight mitigation of his grief being to dwell upon striking
episodes in the lives of those happier ones who had held it with success
and renown His tale of disappointment used to cause some wonder why his
ambition should have taken such an unfortunate form but its nobleness
was never questioned In those days too there was still living an old
woman who for the cure of some eating disease had been taken in her
youth to have her blood turned by a convicts corpse in the manner
described in The Withered Arm

Since writing this story some years ago I have been reminded by an aged
friend who knew Rhoda Brook that in relating her dream my
forgetfulness has weakened the facts our of which the tale grew In
reality it was while lying down on a hot afternoon that the incubus
oppressed her and she flung it off with the results upon the body of the
original as described To my mind the occurrence of such a vision in the
daytime is more impressive than if it had happened in a midnight dream
Readers are therefore asked to correct the misrelation which affords an
instance of how our imperfect memories insensibly formalize the fresh
originality of living factfrom whose shape they slowly depart as
machinemade castings depart by degrees from the sharp handwork of the
mould

Among the many devices for concealing smuggled goods in caves and pits of
the earth that of planting an appletree in a tray or box which was
placed over the mouth of the pit is I believe unique and it is
detailed in one of the tales precisely as described by an old carrier of
tubsa man who was afterwards in my fathers employ for over thirty
years I never gathered from his reminiscences what means were adopted
for lifting the tree which with its roots earth and receptacle must
have been of considerable weight There is no doubt however that the
thing was done through many years My informant often spoke too of the
horribly suffocating sensation produced by the pair of spirittubs slung
upon the chest and back after stumbling with the burden of them for
several miles inland over a rough country and in darkness He said that
though years of his youth and young manhood were spent in this irregular
business his profits from the same taken all together did not average
the wages he might have earned in a steady employment whilst the
fatigues and risks were excessive

I may add that the first story in the series turns upon a physical
possibility that may attach to women of imaginative temperament and that
is well supported by the experiences of medical men and other observers
of such manifestations

AN IMAGINATIVE WOMAN


When William Marchmill had finished his inquiries for lodgings at a well
known wateringplace in Upper Wessex he returned to the hotel to find
his wife She with the children had rambled along the shore and
Marchmill followed in the direction indicated by the militarylooking
hallporter

By Jove how far youve gone I am quite out of breath Marchmill
said rather impatiently when he came up with his wife who was reading
as she walked the three children being considerably further ahead with
the nurse

Mrs Marchmill started out of the reverie into which the book had thrown
her Yes she said youve been such a long time I was tired of
staying in that dreary hotel But I am sorry if you have wanted me
Will

Well I have had trouble to suit myself When you see the airy and
comfortable rooms heard of you find they are stuffy and uncomfortable
Will you come and see if what Ive fixed on will do There is not much
room I am afraid hut I can light on nothing better The town is rather
full

The pair left the children and nurse to continue their ramble and went
back together

In age wellbalanced in personal appearance fairly matched and in
domestic requirements conformable in temper this couple differed though
even here they did not often clash he being equable if not lymphatic
and she decidedly nervous and sanguine It was to their tastes and
fancies those smallest greatest particulars that no common denominator
could be applied Marchmill considered his wifes likes and inclinations
somewhat silly she considered his sordid and material The husbands
business was that of a gunmaker in a thriving city northwards and his
soul was in that business always the lady was best characterized by that
superannuated phrase of elegance a votary of the muse An
impressionable palpitating creature was Ella shrinking humanely from
detailed knowledge of her husbands trade whenever she reflected that
everything he manufactured had for its purpose the destruction of life
She could only recover her equanimity by assuring herself that some at
least of his weapons were sooner or later used for the extermination of
horrid vermin and animals almost as cruel to their inferiors in species
as human beings were to theirs

She had never antecedently regarded this occupation of his as any
objection to having him for a husband Indeed the necessity of getting
lifeleased at all cost a cardinal virtue which all good mothers teach
kept her from thinking of it at all till she had closed with William had
passed the honeymoon and reached the reflecting stage Then like a
person who has stumbled upon some object in the dark she wondered what
she had got mentally walked round it estimated it whether it were rare
or common contained gold silver or lead were a clog or a pedestal
everything to her or nothing

She came to some vague conclusions and since then had kept her heart
alive by pitying her proprietors obtuseness and want of refinement
pitying herself and letting off her delicate and ethereal emotions in
imaginative occupations daydreams and nightsighs which perhaps would
not much have disturbed William if he had known of them

Her figure was small elegant and slight in build tripping or rather
bounding in movement She was darkeyed and had that marvellously
bright and liquid sparkle in each pupil which characterizes persons of
Ellas cast of soul and is too often a cause of heartache to the
possessors male friends ultimately sometimes to herself Her husband
was a tall longfeatured man with a brown beard he had a pondering
regard and was it must be added usually kind and tolerant to her He
spoke in squarely shaped sentences and was supremely satisfied with a
condition of sublunary things which made weapons a necessity

Husband and wife walked till they had reached the house they were in
search of which stood in a terrace facing the sea and was fronted by a
small garden of windproof and saltproof evergreens stone steps leading
up to the porch It had its number in the row but being rather larger
than the rest was in addition sedulously distinguished as Coburg House
by its landlady though everybody else called it Thirteen New Parade
The spot was bright and lively now but in winter it became necessary to
place sandbags against the door and to stuff up the keyhole against the
wind and rain which had worn the paint so thin that the priming and
knotting showed through

The householder who bad been watching for the gentlemans return met
them in the passage and showed the rooms She informed them that she
was a professional mans widow left in needy circumstances by the rather
sudden death of her husband and she spoke anxiously of the conveniences
of the establishment

Mrs Marchmill said that she liked the situation and the house but it
being small there would not be accommodation enough unless she could
have all the rooms

The landlady mused with an air of disappointment She wanted the
visitors to be her tenants very badly she said with obvious honesty
But unfortunately two of the rooms were occupied permanently by a
bachelor gentleman He did not pay season prices it was true but as he
kept on his apartments all the year round and was an extremely nice and
interesting young man who gave no trouble she did not like to turn him
out for a months let even at a high figure Perhaps however she
added he might offer to go for a time

They would not hear of this and went back to the hotel intending to
proceed to the agents to inquire further Hardly had they sat down to
tea when the landlady called Her gentleman she said had been so
obliging as to offer to give up his rooms for three or four weeks rather
than drive the newcomers away

It is very kind but we wont inconvenience him in that way said the
Marchmills

O it wont inconvenience him I assure you said the landlady
eloquently You see hes a different sort of young man from
mostdreamy solitary rather melancholyand he cares more to be here
when the southwesterly gales are beating against the door and the sea
washes over the Parade and theres not a soul in the place than he does
now in the season Hed just as soon be where in fact hes going
temporarily to a little cottage on the Island opposite for a change
She hoped therefore that they would come

The Marchmill family accordingly took possession of the house next day
and it seemed to suit them very well After luncheon Mr Marchmill
strolled out towards the pier and Mrs Marchmill having despatched the
children to their outdoor amusements on the sands settled herself in
more completely examining this and that article and testing the
reflecting powers of the mirror in the wardrobe door

In the small back sittingroom which had been the young bachelors she
found furniture of a more personal nature than in the rest Shabby
books of correct rather than rare editions were piled up in a queerly
reserved manner in corners as if the previous occupant had not conceived
the possibility that any incoming person of the seasons bringing could
care to look inside them The landlady hovered on the threshold to
rectify anything that Mrs Marchmill might not find to her satisfaction

Ill make this my own little room said the latter because the books
are here By the way the person who has left seems to have a good many
He wont mind my reading some of them Mrs Hooper I hope

O dear no maam Yes he has a good many You see he is in the
literary line himself somewhat He is a poetyes really a poetand he
has a little income of his own which is enough to write verses on but
not enough for cutting a figure even if he cared to

A poet O I did not know that

Mrs Marchmill opened one of the books and saw the owners name written
on the titlepage Dear me she continued I know his name very
wellRobert Treweof course I do and his writings And it is his
rooms we have taken and him we have turned out of his home

Ella Marchmill sitting down alone a few minutes later thought with
interested surprise of Robert Trewe Her own latter history will best
explain that interest Herself the only daughter of a struggling man of
letters she had during the last year or two taken to writing poems in
an endeavour to find a congenial channel in which to let flow her
painfully embayed emotions whose former limpidity and sparkle seemed
departing in the stagnation caused by the routine of a practical
household and the gloom of bearing children to a commonplace father
These poems subscribed with a masculine pseudonym had appeared in
various obscure magazines and in two cases in rather prominent ones In
the second of the latter the page which bore her effusion at the bottom
in smallish print bore at the top in large print a few verses on the
same subject by this very man Robert Trewe Both of them had in fact
been struck by a tragic incident reported in the daily papers and had
used it simultaneously as an inspiration the editor remarking in a note
upon the coincidence and that the excellence of both poems prompted him
to give them together

After that event Ella otherwise John Ivy had watched with much
attention the appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing the signature
of Robert Trewe who with a mans unsusceptibility on the question of
sex had never once thought of passing himself off as a woman To be
sure Mrs Marchmill had satisfied herself with a sort of reason for
doing the contrary in her case that nobody might believe in her
inspiration if they found that the sentiments came from a pushing
tradesmans wife from the mother of three children by a matteroffact
smallarms manufacturer

Trewes verse contrasted with that of the rank and file of recent minor
poets in being impassioned rather than ingenious luxuriant rather than
finished Neither symboliste nor decadent he was a pessimist in so far
as that character applies to a man who looks at the worst contingencies
as well as the best in the human condition Being little attracted by
excellences of form and rhythm apart from content he sometimes when
feeling outran his artistic speed perpetrated sonnets in the loosely
rhymed Elizabethan fashion which every rightminded reviewer said he
ought not to have done

With sad and hopeless envy Ella Marchmill had often and often scanned
the rival poets work so much stronger as it always was than her own
feeble lines She had imitated him and her inability to touch his level
would send her into fits of despondency Months passed away thus till
she observed from the publishers list that Trewe had collected his
fugitive pieces into a volume which was duly issued and was much or
little praised according to chance and had a sale quite sufficient to
pay for the printing

This step onward had suggested to John Ivy the idea of collecting her
pieces also or at any rate of making up a book of her rhymes by adding
many in manuscript to the few that had seen the light for she had been
able to get no great number into print A ruinous charge was made for
costs of publication a few reviews noticed her poor little volume but
nobody talked of it nobody bought it and it fell dead in a fortnightif
it had ever been alive

The authors thoughts were diverted to another groove just then by the
discovery that she was going to have a third child and the collapse of
her poetical venture had perhaps less effect upon her mind than it might
have done if she had been domestically unoccupied Her husband had paid
the publishers bill with the doctors and there it all had ended for
the time But though less than a poet of her century Ella was more
than a mere multiplier of her kind and latterly she had begun to feel
the old afflatus once more And now by an odd conjunction she found
herself in the rooms of Robert Trewe

She thoughtfully rose from her chair and searched the apartment with the
interest of a fellowtradesman Yes the volume of his own verse was
among the rest Though quite familiar with its contents she read it
here as if it spoke aloud to her then called up Mrs Hooper the
landlady for some trivial service and inquired again about the young
man

Well Im sure youd be interested in him maam if you could see him
only hes so shy that I dont suppose you will Mrs Hooper seemed
nothing loth to minister to her tenants curiosity about her predecessor
Lived here long Yes nearly two years He keeps on his rooms even
when hes not here the soft air of this place suits his chest and he
likes to be able to come back at any time He is mostly writing or
reading and doesnt see many people though for the matter of that he
is such a good kind young fellow that folks would only be too glad to be
friendly with him if they knew him You dont meet kindhearted people
every day

Ah hes kindhearted    and good

Yes hell oblige me in anything if I ask him Mr Trewe I say to
him sometimes you are rather out of spirits Well I am Mrs
Hooper hell say though I dont know how you should find it out
Why not take a little change I ask Then in a day or two hell say
that he will take a trip to Paris or Norway or somewhere and I assure
you he comes back all the better for it

Ah indeed His is a sensitive nature no doubt

Yes Still hes odd in some things Once when he had finished a poem
of his composition late at night he walked up and down the room
rehearsing it and the floors being so thinjerrybuilt houses you
know though I say it myselfhe kept me awake up above him till I wished
him further    But we get on very well

This was but the beginning of a series of conversations about the rising
poet as the days went on On one of these occasions Mrs Hooper drew
Ellas attention to what she had not noticed before minute scribblings
in pencil on the wallpaper behind the curtains at the head of the bed

O let me look said Mrs Marchmill unable to conceal a rush of tender
curiosity as she bent her pretty face close to the wall

These said Mrs Hooper with the manner of a woman who knew things
are the very beginnings and first thoughts of his verses He has tried
to rub most of them out but you can read them still My belief is that
he wakes up in the night you know with some rhyme in his head and jots
it down there on the wall lest he should forget it by the morning Some
of these very lines you see here I have seen afterwards in print in the
magazines Some are newer indeed I have not seen that one before It
must have been done only a few days ago

O yes    

Ella Marchmill flushed without knowing why and suddenly wished her
companion would go away now that the information was imparted An
indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary
made her anxious to read the inscription alone and she accordingly
waited till she could do so with a sense that a great store of emotion
would be enjoyed in the act

Perhaps because the sea was choppy outside the Island Ellas husband
found it much pleasanter to go sailing and steaming about without his
wife who was a bad sailor than with her He did not disdain to go thus
alone on board the steamboats of the cheaptrippers where there was
dancing by moonlight and where the couples would come suddenly down with
a lurch into each others arms for as he blandly told her the company
was too mixed for him to take her amid such scenes Thus while this
thriving manufacturer got a great deal of change and seaair out of his
sojourn here the life external at least of Ella was monotonous enough
and mainly consisted in passing a certain number of hours each day in
bathing and walking up and down a stretch of shore But the poetic
impulse having again waxed strong she was possessed by an inner flame
which left her hardly conscious of what was proceeding around her

She had read till she knew by heart Trewes last little volume of verses
and spent a great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival some of
them till in her failure she burst into tears The personal element
in the magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient
unapproachable master of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual
and abstract that she could not understand it To be sure she was
surrounded noon and night by his customary environment which literally
whispered of him to her at every moment but he was a man she had never
seen and that all that moved her was the instinct to specialize a
waiting emotion on the first fit thing that came to hand did not of
course suggest itself to Ella

In the natural way of passion under the too practical conditions which
civilization has devised for its fruition her husbands love for her had
not survived except in the form of fitful friendship any more than or
even so much as her own for him and being a woman of very living
ardours that required sustenance of some sort they were beginning to
feed on this chancing material which was indeed of a quality far
better than chance usually offers

One day the children had been playing hideandseek in a closet whence
in their excitement they pulled out some clothing Mrs Hooper
explained that it belonged to Mr Trewe and hung it up in the closet
again Possessed of her fantasy Ella went later in the afternoon when
nobody was in that part of the house opened the closet unhitched one of
the articles a mackintosh and put it on with the waterproof cap
belonging to it

The mantle of Elijah she said Would it might inspire me to rival
him glorious genius that he is

Her eyes always grew wet when she thought like that and she turned to
look at herself in the glass His heart had beat inside that coat and
his brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never
reach The consciousness of her weakness beside him made her feel quite
sick Before she had got the things off her the door opened and her
husband entered the room

What the devil

She blushed and removed them

I found them in the closet here she said and put them on in a freak
What have I else to do You are always away

Always away Well    

That evening she had a further talk with the landlady who might herself
have nourished a halftender regard for the poet so ready was she to
discourse ardently about him

You are interested in Mr Trewe I know maam she said and he has
just sent to say that he is going to call tomorrow afternoon to look up
some books of his that he wants if Ill be in and he may select them
from your room

O yes

You could very well meet Mr Trewe then if youd like to be in the way

She promised with secret delight and went to bed musing of him

Next morning her husband observed Ive been thinking of what you said
Ell that I have gone about a good deal and left you without much to
amuse you Perhaps its true Today as theres not much sea Ill
take you with me on board the yacht

For the first time in her experience of such an offer Ella was not glad
But she accepted it for the moment The time for setting out drew near
and she went to get ready She stood reflecting The longing to see the
poet she was now distinctly in love with overpowered all other
considerations

I dont want to go she said to herself I cant bear to be away And
I wont go

She told her husband that she had changed her mind about wishing to sail
He was indifferent and went his way

For the rest of the day the house was quiet the children having gone out
upon the sands The blinds waved in the sunshine to the soft steady
stroke of the sea beyond the wall and the notes of the Green Silesian
band a troop of foreign gentlemen hired for the season had drawn almost
all the residents and promenaders away from the vicinity of Coburg House
A knock was audible at the door

Mrs Marchmill did not hear any servant go to answer it and she became
impatient The books were in the room where she sat but nobody came up
She rang the bell

There is some person waiting at the door she said

O no maam Hes gone long ago I answered it

Mrs Hooper came in herself

So disappointing she said Mr Trewe not coming after all

But I heard him knock I fancy

No that was somebody inquiring for lodgings who came to the wrong
house I forgot to tell you that Mr Trewe sent a note just before lunch
to say I neednt get any tea for him as he should not require the books
and wouldnt come to select them

Ella was miserable and for a long time could not even reread his
mournful ballad on Severed Lives so aching was her erratic little
heart and so tearful her eyes When the children came in with wet
stockings and ran up to her to tell her of their adventures she could
not feel that she cared about them half as much as usual

    

Mrs Hooper have you a photograph ofthe gentleman who lived here
She was getting to be curiously shy in mentioning his name

Why yes Its in the ornamental frame on the mantelpiece in your own
bedroom maam

No the Royal Duke and Duchess are in that

Yes so they are but hes behind them He belongs rightly to that
frame which I bought on purpose but as he went away he said Cover me
up from those strangers that are coming for Gods sake I dont want
them staring at me and I am sure they wont want me staring at them So
I slipped in the Duke and Duchess temporarily in front of him as they
had no frame and Royalties are more suitable for letting furnished than
a private young man If you take em out youll see him under Lord
maam he wouldnt mind if he knew it He didnt think the next tenant
would be such an attractive lady as you or he wouldnt have thought of
hiding himself perhaps

Is he handsome she asked timidly

I call him so Some perhaps wouldnt

Should I she asked with eagerness

I think you would though some would say hes more striking than
handsome a largeeyed thoughtful fellow you know with a very electric
flash in his eye when he looks round quickly such as youd expect a poet
to be who doesnt get his living by it

How old is he

Several years older than yourself maam about thirtyone or two I
think

Ella was as a matter of fact a few months over thirty herself but she
did not look nearly so much Though so immature in nature she was
entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin to suspect
that last love may be stronger than first love and she would soon alas
enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the vainer ones of
her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise than with their
backs to the window or the blinds half down She reflected on Mrs
Hoopers remark and said no more about age

Just then a telegram was brought up It came from her husband who had
gone down the Channel as far as Budmouth with his friends in the yacht
and would not be able to get back till next day

After her light dinner Ella idled about the shore with the children till
dusk thinking of the yet uncovered photograph in her room with a serene
sense of something ecstatic to come For with the subtle luxuriousness
of fancy in which this young woman was an adept on learning that her
husband was to be absent that night she had refrained from incontinently
rushing upstairs and opening the pictureframe preferring to reserve the
inspection till she could be alone and a more romantic tinge be imparted
to the occasion by silence candles solemn sea and stars outside than
was afforded by the garish afternoon sunlight

The children had been sent to bed and Ella soon followed though it was
not yet ten oclock To gratify her passionate curiosity she now made
her preparations first getting rid of superfluous garments and putting
on her dressinggown then arranging a chair in front of the table and
reading several pages of Trewes tenderest utterances Then she fetched
the portraitframe to the light opened the back took out the likeness
and set it up before her

It was a striking countenance to look upon The poet wore a luxuriant
black moustache and imperial and a slouched hat which shaded the
forehead The large dark eyes described by the landlady showed an
unlimited capacity for misery they looked out from beneath wellshaped
brows as if they were reading the universe in the microcosm of the
confronters face and were not altogether overjoyed at what the
spectacle portended

Ella murmured in her lowest richest tenderest tone And its you
whove so cruelly eclipsed me these many times

As she gazed long at the portrait she fell into thought till her eyes
filled with tears and she touched the cardboard with her lips Then she
laughed with a nervous lightness and wiped her eyes

She thought how wicked she was a woman having a husband and three
children to let her mind stray to a stranger in this unconscionable
manner No he was not a stranger She knew his thoughts and feelings
as well as she knew her own they were in fact the selfsame thoughts
and feelings as hers which her husband distinctly lacked perhaps
luckily for himself considering that he had to provide for family
expenses

Hes nearer my real self hes more intimate with the real me than Will
is after all even though Ive never seen him she said

She laid his book and picture on the table at the bedside and when she
was reclining on the pillow she reread those of Robert Trewes verses
which she had marked from time to time as most touching and true Putting
these aside she set up the photograph on its edge upon the coverlet and
contemplated it as she lay Then she scanned again by the light of the
candle the halfobliterated pencillings on the wallpaper beside her
head There they werephrases couplets boutsrimes beginnings and
middles of lines ideas in the rough like Shelleys scraps and the
least of them so intense so sweet so palpitating that it seemed as if
his very breath warm and loving fanned her cheeks from those walls
walls that had surrounded his head times and times as they surrounded her
own now He must often have put up his hand sowith the pencil in it
Yes the writing was sideways as it would be if executed by one who
extended his arm thus

These inscribed shapes of the poets world

 Forms more real than living man
 Nurslings of immortality

were no doubt the thoughts and spiritstrivings which had come to him
in the dead of night when he could let himself go and have no fear of
the frost of criticism No doubt they had often been written up hastily
by the light of the moon the rays of the lamp in the bluegrey dawn in
full daylight perhaps never And now her hair was dragging where his arm
had lain when he secured the fugitive fancies she was sleeping on a
poets lips immersed in the very essence of him permeated by his spirit
as by an ether

While she was dreaming the minutes away thus a footstep came upon the
stairs and in a moment she heard her husbands heavy step on the landing
immediately without

Ell where are you

What possessed her she could not have described but with an instinctive
objection to let her husband know what she had been doing she slipped
the photograph under the pillow just as he flung open the door with the
air of a man who had dined not badly

O I beg pardon said William Marchmill Have you a headache I am
afraid I have disturbed you

No Ive not got a headache said she How is it youve come

Well we found we could get back in very good time after all and I
didnt want to make another day of it because of going somewhere else to
morrow

Shall I come down again

O no Im as tired as a dog Ive had a good feed and I shall turn in
straight off I want to get out at six oclock tomorrow if I can   
I shant disturb you by my getting up it will be long before you are
awake And he came forward into the room

While her eyes followed his movements Ella softly pushed the photograph
further out of sight

Sure youre not ill he asked bending over her

No only wicked

Never mind that And he stooped and kissed her

Next morning Marchmill was called at six oclock and in waking and
yawning she heard him muttering to himself What the deuce is this
thats been crackling under me so Imagining her asleep he searched
round him and withdrew something Through her halfopened eyes she
perceived it to be Mr Trewe

Well Im damned her husband exclaimed

What dear said she

O you are awake Ha ha

What do you mean

Some blokes photographa friend of our landladys I suppose I
wonder how it came here whisked off the table by accident perhaps when
they were making the bed

I was looking at it yesterday and it must have dropped in then

O hes a friend of yours Bless his picturesque heart

Ellas loyalty to the object of her admiration could not endure to hear
him ridiculed Hes a clever man she said with a tremor in her
gentle voice which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for

He is a rising poetthe gentleman who occupied two of these rooms
before we came though Ive never seen him

How do you know if youve never seen him

Mrs Hooper told me when she showed me the photograph

O well I must up and be off I shall be home rather early Sorry I
cant take you today dear Mind the children dont go getting
drowned

That day Mrs Marchmill inquired if Mr Trewe were likely to call at any
other time

Yes said Mrs Hooper Hes coming this day week to stay with a
friend near here till you leave Hell be sure to call

Marchmill did return quite early in the afternoon and opening some
letters which had arrived in his absence declared suddenly that he and
his family would have to leave a week earlier than they had expected to
doin short in three days

Surely we can stay a week longer she pleaded I like it here

I dont It is getting rather slow

Then you might leave me and the children

How perverse you are Ell Whats the use And have to come to fetch
you No well all return together and well make out our time in North
Wales or Brighton a little later on Besides youve three days longer
yet

It seemed to be her doom not to meet the man for whose rival talent she
had a despairing admiration and to whose person she was now absolutely
attached Yet she determined to make a last effort and having gathered
from her landlady that Trewe was living in a lonely spot not far from the
fashionable town on the Island opposite she crossed over in the packet
from the neighbouring pier the following afternoon

What a useless journey it was Ella knew but vaguely where the house
stood and when she fancied she had found it and ventured to inquire of
a pedestrian if he lived there the answer returned by the man was that
he did not know And if he did live there how could she call upon him
Some women might have the assurance to do it but she had not How crazy
he would think her She might have asked him to call upon her perhaps
but she had not the courage for that either She lingered mournfully
about the picturesque seaside eminence till it was time to return to the
town and enter the steamer for recrossing reaching home for dinner
without having been greatly missed

At the last moment unexpectedly enough her husband said that he should
have no objection to letting her and the children stay on till the end of
the week since she wished to do so if she felt herself able to get home
without him She concealed the pleasure this extension of time gave her
and Marchmill went off the next morning alone

But the week passed and Trewe did not call

On Saturday morning the remaining members of the Marchmill family
departed from the place which had been productive of so much fervour in
her The dreary dreary train the sun shining in moted beams upon the
hot cushions the dusty permanent way the mean rows of wirethese
things were her accompaniment while out of the window the deep blue sea
levels disappeared from her gaze and with them her poets home Heavy
hearted she tried to read and wept instead

Mr Marchmill was in a thriving way of business and he and his family
lived in a large new house which stood in rather extensive grounds a few
miles outside the city wherein he carried on his trade Ellas life was
lonely here as the suburban life is apt to be particularly at certain
seasons and she had ample time to indulge her taste for lyric and
elegiac composition She had hardly got back when she encountered a
piece by Robert Trewe in the new number of her favourite magazine which
must have been written almost immediately before her visit to Solentsea
for it contained the very couplet she had seen pencilled on the wallpaper
by the bed and Mrs Hooper had declared to be recent Ella could resist
no longer but seizing a pen impulsively wrote to him as a brotherpoet
using the name of John Ivy congratulating him in her letter on his
triumphant executions in metre and rhythm of thoughts that moved his
soul as compared with her own browbeaten efforts in the same pathetic
trade

To this address there came a response in a few days little as she had
dared to hope for ita civil and brief note in which the young poet
stated that though he was not well acquainted with Mr Ivys verse he
recalled the name as being one he had seen attached to some very
promising pieces that he was glad to gain Mr Ivys acquaintance by
letter and should certainly look with much interest for his productions
in the future

There must have been something juvenile or timid in her own epistle as
one ostensibly coming from a man she declared to herself for Trewe
quite adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply But what
did it matter he had replied he had written to her with his own hand
from that very room she knew so well for he was now back again in his
quarters

The correspondence thus begun was continued for two months or more Ella
Marchmill sending him from time to time some that she considered to be
the best of her pieces which he very kindly accepted though he did not
say he sedulously read them nor did he send her any of his own in
return Ella would have been more hurt at this than she was if she had
not known that Trewe laboured under the impression that she was one of
his own sex

Yet the situation was unsatisfactory A flattering little voice told her
that were he only to see her matters would be otherwise No doubt she
would have helped on this by making a frank confession of womanhood to
begin with if something had not happened to her delight to render it
unnecessary A friend of her husbands the editor of the most important
newspaper in the city and county who was dining with them one day
observed during their conversation about the poet that his the editors
brother the landscapepainter was a friend of Mr Trewes and that the
two men were at that very moment in Wales together

Ella was slightly acquainted with the editors brother The next morning
down she sat and wrote inviting him to stay at her house for a short
time on his way back and requesting him to bring with him if
practicable his companion Mr Trewe whose acquaintance she was anxious
to make The answer arrived after some few days Her correspondent and
his friend Trewe would have much satisfaction in accepting her invitation
on their way southward which would be on such and such a day in the
following week

Ella was blithe and buoyant Her scheme had succeeded her beloved
though as yet unseen one was coming Behold he standeth behind our
wall he looked forth at the windows showing himself through the
lattice she thought ecstatically And lo the winter is past the
rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the
singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
land

But it was necessary to consider the details of lodging and feeding him
This she did most solicitously and awaited the pregnant day and hour

It was about five in the afternoon when she heard a ring at the door and
the editors brothers voice in the hall Poetess as she was or as she
thought herself she had not been too sublime that day to dress with
infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich material having a faint
resemblance to the chiton of the Greeks a style just then in vogue among
ladies of an artistic and romantic turn which had been obtained by Ella
of her Bond Street dressmaker when she was last in London Her visitor
entered the drawingroom She looked towards his rear nobody else came
through the door Where in the name of the God of Love was Robert
Trewe

O Im sorry said the painter after their introductory words had been
spoken Trewe is a curious fellow you know Mrs Marchmill He said
hed come then he said he couldnt Hes rather dusty Weve been
doing a few miles with knapsacks you know and he wanted to get on
home

Hehes not coming

Hes not and he asked me to make his apologies

When did you pppart from him she asked her nether lip starting off
quivering so much that it was like a tremolostop opened in her speech
She longed to run away from this dreadful bore and cry her eyes out

Just now in the turnpike road yonder there

What he has actually gone past my gates

Yes When we got to themhandsome gates they are too the finest bit
of modern wroughtiron work I have seenwhen we came to them we stopped
talking there a little while and then he wished me goodbye and went on
The truth is hes a little bit depressed just now and doesnt want to
see anybody Hes a very good fellow and a warm friend but a little
uncertain and gloomy sometimes he thinks too much of things His poetry
is rather too erotic and passionate you know for some tastes and he
has just come in for a terrible slating from the  Review that was
published yesterday he saw a copy of it at the station by accident
Perhaps youve read it

No

So much the better O it is not worth thinking of just one of those
articles written to order to please the narrowminded set of subscribers
upon whom the circulation depends But hes upset by it He says it is
the misrepresentation that hurts him so that though he can stand a fair
attack he cant stand lies that hes powerless to refute and stop from
spreading Thats just Trewes weak point He lives so much by himself
that these things affect him much more than they would if he were in the
bustle of fashionable or commercial life So he wouldnt come here
making the excuse that it all looked so new and moniedif youll
pardon

Buthe must have knownthere was sympathy here Has he never said
anything about getting letters from this address

Yes yes he has from John Ivyperhaps a relative of yours he
thought visiting here at the time

Did helike Ivy did he say

Well I dont know that he took any great interest in Ivy

Or in his poems

Or in his poemsso far as I know that is

Robert Trewe took no interest in her house in her poems or in their
writer As soon as she could get away she went into the nursery and
tried to let off her emotion by unnecessarily kissing the children till
she had a sudden sense of disgust at being reminded how plainlooking
they were like their father

The obtuse and singleminded landscapepainter never once perceived from
her conversation that it was only Trewe she wanted and not himself He
made the best of his visit seeming to enjoy the society of Ellas
husband who also took a great fancy to him and showed him everywhere
about the neighbourhood neither of them noticing Ellas mood

The painter had been gone only a day or two when while sitting upstairs
alone one morning she glanced over the London paper just arrived and
read the following paragraph

 SUICIDE OF A POET

 Mr Robert Trewe who has been favourably known for some years as one
 of our rising lyrists committed suicide at his lodgings at Solentsea
 on Saturday evening last by shooting himself in the right temple with
 a revolver Readers hardly need to be reminded that Mr Trewe has
 recently attracted the attention of a much wider public than had
 hitherto known him by his new volume of verse mostly of an
 impassioned kind entitled Lyrics to a Woman Unknown which has been
 already favourably noticed in these pages for the extraordinary gamut
 of feeling it traverses and which has been made the subject of a
 severe if not ferocious criticism in the  Review It is
 supposed though not certainly known that the article may have
 partially conduced to the sad act as a copy of the review in question
 was found on his writingtable and he has been observed to be in a
 somewhat depressed state of mind since the critique appeared

Then came the report of the inquest at which the following letter was
read it having been addressed to a friend at a distance

 DEAR Before these lines reach your hands I shall be delivered
 from the inconveniences of seeing hearing and knowing more of the
 things around me I will not trouble you by giving my reasons for the
 step I have taken though I can assure you they were sound and
 logical Perhaps had I been blessed with a mother or a sister or a
 female friend of another sort tenderly devoted to me I might have
 thought it worth while to continue my present existence I have long
 dreamt of such an unattainable creature as you know and she this
 undiscoverable elusive one inspired my last volume the imaginary
 woman alone for in spite of what has been said in some quarters
 there is no real woman behind the title She has continued to the
 last unrevealed unmet unwon I think it desirable to mention this
 in order that no blame may attach to any real woman as having been the
 cause of my decease by cruel or cavalier treatment of me Tell my
 landlady that I am sorry to have caused her this unpleasantness but
 my occupancy of the rooms will soon be forgotten There are ample
 funds in my name at the bank to pay all expenses R TREWE

Ella sat for a while as if stunned then rushed into the adjoining
chamber and flung herself upon her face on the bed

Her grief and distraction shook her to pieces and she lay in this frenzy
of sorrow for more than an hour Broken words came every now and then
from her quivering lips O if he had only known of meknown of meme
   O if I had only once met himonly once and put my hand upon his
hot foreheadkissed himlet him know how I loved himthat I would have
suffered shame and scorn would have lived and died for him Perhaps it
would have saved his dear life    But noit was not allowed God is
a jealous God and that happiness was not for him and me

All possibilities were over the meeting was stultified Yet it was
almost visible to her in her fantasy even now though it could never be
substantiated 

 The hour which might have been yet might not be
 Which mans and womans heart conceived and bore
 Yet whereof life was barren

    

She wrote to the landlady at Solentsea in the third person in as subdued
a style as she could command enclosing a postal order for a sovereign
and informing Mrs Hooper that Mrs Marchmill had seen in the papers the
sad account of the poets death and having been as Mrs Hooper was
aware much interested in Mr Trewe during her stay at Coburg House she
would be obliged if Mrs Hooper could obtain a small portion of his hair
before his coffin was closed down and send it her as a memorial of him
as also the photograph that was in the frame

By the returnpost a letter arrived containing what had been requested
Ella wept over the portrait and secured it in her private drawer the
lock of hair she tied with white ribbon and put in her bosom whence she
drew it and kissed it every now and then in some unobserved nook

Whats the matter said her husband looking up from his newspaper on
one of these occasions Crying over something A lock of hair Whose
is it

Hes dead she murmured

Who

I dont want to tell you Will just now unless you insist she said
a sob hanging heavy in her voice

O all right

Do you mind my refusing I will tell you some day

It doesnt matter in the least of course

He walked away whistling a few bars of no tune in particular and when he
had got down to his factory in the city the subject came into Marchmills
head again

He too was aware that a suicide had taken place recently at the house
they had occupied at Solentsea Having seen the volume of poems in his
wifes hand of late and heard fragments of the landladys conversation
about Trewe when they were her tenants he all at once said to himself
Why of course its he How the devil did she get to know him What sly
animals women are

Then he placidly dismissed the matter and went on with his daily
affairs By this time Ella at home had come to a determination Mrs
Hooper in sending the hair and photograph had informed her of the day
of the funeral and as the morning and noon wore on an overpowering wish
to know where they were laying him took possession of the sympathetic
woman Caring very little now what her husband or any one else might
think of her eccentricities she wrote Marchmill a brief note stating
that she was called away for the afternoon and evening but would return
on the following morning This she left on his desk and having given
the same information to the servants went out of the house on foot

When Mr Marchmill reached home early in the afternoon the servants
looked anxious The nurse took him privately aside and hinted that her
mistresss sadness during the past few days had been such that she feared
she had gone out to drown herself Marchmill reflected Upon the whole
he thought that she had not done that Without saying whither he was
bound he also started off telling them not to sit up for him He drove
to the railwaystation and took a ticket for Solentsea

It was dark when he reached the place though he had come by a fast
train and he knew that if his wife had preceded him thither it could
only have been by a slower train arriving not a great while before his
own The season at Solentsea was now past the parade was gloomy and
the flys were few and cheap He asked the way to the Cemetery and soon
reached it The gate was locked but the keeper let him in declaring
however that there was nobody within the precincts Although it was not
late the autumnal darkness had now become intense and he found some
difficulty in keeping to the serpentine path which led to the quarter
where as the man had told him the one or two interments for the day had
taken place He stepped upon the grass and stumbling over some pegs
stooped now and then to discern if possible a figure against the sky

He could see none but lighting on a spot where the soil was trodden
beheld a crouching object beside a newly made grave She heard him and
sprang up

Ell how silly this is he said indignantly Running away from homeI
never heard such a thing Of course I am not jealous of this unfortunate
man but it is too ridiculous that you a married woman with three
children and a fourth coming should go losing your head like this over a
dead lover    Do you know you were locked in You might not have
been able to get out all night

She did not answer

I hope it didnt go far between you and him for your own sake

Dont insult me Will

Mind I wont have any more of this sort of thing do you hear

Very well she said

He drew her arm within his own and conducted her out of the Cemetery It
was impossible to get back that night and not wishing to be recognized
in their present sorry condition he took her to a miserable little
coffeehouse close to the station whence they departed early in the
morning travelling almost without speaking under the sense that it was
one of those dreary situations occurring in married life which words
could not mend and reaching their own door at noon

The months passed and neither of the twain ever ventured to start a
conversation upon this episode Ella seemed to be only too frequently in
a sad and listless mood which might almost have been called pining The
time was approaching when she would have to undergo the stress of
childbirth for a fourth time and that apparently did not tend to raise
her spirits

I dont think I shall get over it this time she said one day

Pooh what childish foreboding Why shouldnt it be as well now as
ever

She shook her head I feel almost sure I am going to die and I should
be glad if it were not for Nelly and Frank and Tiny

And me

Youll soon find somebody to fill my place she murmured with a sad
smile And youll have a perfect right to I assure you of that

Ell you are not thinking still about thatpoetical friend of yours

She neither admitted nor denied the charge I am not going to get over
my illness this time she reiterated Something tells me I shant

This view of things was rather a bad beginning as it usually is and in
fact six weeks later in the month of May she was lying in her room
pulseless and bloodless with hardly strength enough left to follow up
one feeble breath with another the infant for whose unnecessary life she
was slowly parting with her own being fat and well Just before her
death she spoke to Marchmill softly

Will I want to confess to you the entire circumstances of thatabout
you know whatthat time we visited Solentsea I cant tell what
possessed mehow I could forget you so my husband But I had got into
a morbid state I thought you had been unkind that you had neglected me
that you werent up to my intellectual level while he was and far above
it I wanted a fuller appreciator perhaps rather than another lover

She could get no further then for very exhaustion and she went off in
sudden collapse a few hours later without having said anything more to
her husband on the subject of her love for the poet William Marchmill
in truth like most husbands of several years standing was little
disturbed by retrospective jealousies and had not shown the least
anxiety to press her for confessions concerning a man dead and gone
beyond any power of inconveniencing him more

But when she had been buried a couple of years it chanced one day that
in turning over some forgotten papers that he wished to destroy before
his second wife entered the house he lighted on a lock of hair in an
envelope with the photograph of the deceased poet a date being written
on the back in his late wifes hand It was that of the time they spent
at Solentsea

Marchmill looked long and musingly at the hair and portrait for
something struck him Fetching the little boy who had been the death of
his mother now a noisy toddler he took him on his knee held the lock
of hair against the childs head and set up the photograph on the table
behind so that he could closely compare the features each countenance
presented There were undoubtedly strong traces of resemblance the
dreamy and peculiar expression of the poets face sat as the transmitted
idea upon the childs and the hair was of the same hue

Im damned if I didnt think so murmured Marchmill Then she did
play me false with that fellow at the lodgings Let me see the
datesthe second week in August    the third week in May    Yes 
  yes    Get away you poor little brat You are nothing to me

1893




THE THREE STRANGERS


Among the few features of agricultural England which retain an appearance
but little modified by the lapse of centuries may be reckoned the high
grassy and furzy downs coombs or eweleases as they are indifferently
called that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and south
west If any mark of human occupation is met with hereon it usually
takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd

Fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down and may
possibly be standing there now In spite of its loneliness however the
spot by actual measurement was not more than five miles from a county
town Yet that affected it little Five miles of irregular upland
during the long inimical seasons with their sleets snows rains and
mists afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a Timon or a
Nebuchadnezzar much less in fair weather to please that less repellent
tribe the poets philosophers artists and others who conceive and
meditate of pleasant things

Some old earthen camp or barrow some clump of trees at least some
starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the
erection of these forlorn dwellings But in the present case such a
kind of shelter had been disregarded Higher Crowstairs as the house
was called stood quite detached and undefended The only reason for its
precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right
angles hard by which may have crossed there and thus for a good five
hundred years Hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides
But though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow and the
rain hit hard whenever it fell the various weathers of the winter season
were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by
dwellers on low ground The raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the
hollows and the frosts were scarcely so severe When the shepherd and
his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from
the exposure they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced
by wuzzes and flames hoarses and phlegms than when they had lived by
the stream of a snug neighbouring valley

The night of March 28 182 was precisely one of the nights that were
wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration The level
rainstorm smote walls slopes and hedges like the clothyard shafts of
Senlac and Crecy Such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood
with their buttocks to the winds while the tails of little birds trying
to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown insideout like umbrellas The
gableend of the cottage was stained with wet and the eavesdroppings
flapped against the wall Yet never was commiseration for the shepherd
more misplaced For that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party
in glorification of the christening of his second girl

The guests had arrived before the rain began to fall and they were all
now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling A glance into
the apartment at eight oclock on this eventful evening would have
resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as
could be wished for in boisterous weather The calling of its inhabitant
was proclaimed by a number of highlypolished sheepcrooks without stems
that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace the curl of each shining
crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal
pictures of old family Bibles to the most approved fashion of the last
local sheepfair The room was lighted by halfadozen candles having
wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them in
candlesticks that were never used but at highdays holydays and family
feasts The lights were scattered about the room two of them standing
on the chimneypiece This position of candles was in itself
significant Candles on the chimneypiece always meant a party

On the hearth in front of a backbrand to give substance blazed a fire
of thorns that crackled like the laughter of the fool

Nineteen persons were gathered here Of these five women wearing gowns
of various bright hues sat in chairs along the wall girls shy and not
shy filled the windowbench four men including Charley Jake the hedge
carpenter Elijah New the parishclerk and John Pitcher a neighbouring
dairyman the shepherds fatherinlaw lolled in the settle a young man
and maid who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a
lifecompanionship sat beneath the cornercupboard and an elderly
engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where
his betrothed was not to the spot where she was Enjoyment was pretty
general and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by
conventional restrictions Absolute confidence in each others good
opinion begat perfect ease while the finishing stroke of manner
amounting to a truly princely serenity was lent to the majority by the
absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in
the world enlarge their minds or do any eclipsing thing whateverwhich
nowadays so generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two
extremes of the social scale

Shepherd Fennel had married well his wife being a dairymans daughter
from a vale at a distance who brought fifty guineas in her pocketand
kept them there till they should be required for ministering to the
needs of a coming family This frugal woman had been somewhat exercised
as to the character that should be given to the gathering A sitstill
party had its advantages but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs
and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of
toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry A dancing
party was the alternative but this while avoiding the foregoing
objection on the score of good drink had a counterbalancing disadvantage
in the matter of good victuals the ravenous appetites engendered by the
exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery Shepherdess Fennel fell
back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short
periods of talk and singing so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in
either But this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind
the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases
of hospitality

The fiddler was a boy of those parts about twelve years of age who had
a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels though his fingers were so small
and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes from
which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed
purity of tone At seven the shrill tweedledee of this youngster had
begun accompanied by a booming groundbass from Elijah New the parish
clerk who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical
instrument the serpent Dancing was instantaneous Mrs Fennel
privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the
length of a quarter of an hour

But Elijah and the boy in the excitement of their position quite forgot
the injunction Moreover Oliver Giles a man of seventeen one of the
dancers who was enamoured of his partner a fair girl of thirtythree
rolling years had recklessly handed a new crownpiece to the musicians
as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind Mrs
Fennel seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her
guests crossed over and touched the fiddlers elbow and put her hand on
the serpents mouth But they took no notice and fearing she might lose
her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly
she retired and sat down helpless And so the dance whizzed on with
cumulative fury the performers moving in their planetlike courses
direct and retrograde from apogee to perigee till the hand of the well
kicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the
circumference of an hour

While these cheerful events were in course of enactment within Fennels
pastoral dwelling an incident having considerable bearing on the party
had occurred in the gloomy night without Mrs Fennels concern about
the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with
the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher Crowstairs
from the direction of the distant town This personage strode on through
the rain without a pause following the littleworn path which further
on in its course skirted the shepherds cottage

It was nearly the time of full moon and on this account though the sky
was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud ordinary objects out of
doors were readily visible The sad wan light revealed the lonely
pedestrian to be a man of supple frame his gait suggested that he had
somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility though not
so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required At
a rough guess he might have been about forty years of age He appeared
tall but a recruiting sergeant or other person accustomed to the
judging of mens heights by the eye would have discerned that this was
chiefly owing to his gauntness and that he was not more than fivefeet
eight or nine

Notwithstanding the regularity of his tread there was caution in it as
in that of one who mentally feels his way and despite the fact that it
was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore there
was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the
blackcoated tribes of men His clothes were of fustian and his boots
hobnailed yet in his progress he showed not the mudaccustomed bearing
of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry

By the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherds premises the
rain came down or rather came along with yet more determined violence
The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind
and rain and this induced him to stand still The most salient of the
shepherds domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of
his hedgeless garden for in these latitudes the principle of masking the
homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was
unknown The travellers eye was attracted to this small building by the
pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it He turned aside and
finding it empty stood under the pentroof for shelter

While he stood the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house and
the lesser strains of the fiddler reached the spot as an accompaniment
to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod its louder beating on
the cabbageleaves of the garden on the eight or ten beehives just
discernible by the path and its dripping from the eaves into a row of
buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage For
at Higher Crowstairs as at all such elevated domiciles the grand
difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water and a casual
rainfall was utilized by turning out as catchers every utensil that the
house contained Some queer stories might be told of the contrivances
for economy in suds and dishwaters that are absolutely necessitated in
upland habitations during the droughts of summer But at this season
there were no such exigencies a mere acceptance of what the skies
bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store

At last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent This
cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie
into which he had lapsed and emerging from the shed with an apparently
new intention he walked up the path to the housedoor Arrived here
his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of
vessels and to drink a copious draught from one of them Having
quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock but paused with
his eye upon the panel Since the dark surface of the wood revealed
absolutely nothing it was evident that he must be mentally looking
through the door as if he wished to measure thereby all the
possibilities that a house of this sort might include and how they might
bear upon the question of his entry

In his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around Not a soul
was anywhere visible The gardenpath stretched downward from his feet
gleaming like the track of a snail the roof of the little well mostly
dry the wellcover the top rail of the gardengate were varnished
with the same dull liquid glaze while far away in the vale a faint
whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in
the meads Beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the
beating dropslights that denoted the situation of the countytown from
which he had appeared to come The absence of all notes of life in that
direction seemed to clinch his intentions and he knocked at the door

Within a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical
sound The hedgecarpenter was suggesting a song to the company which
nobody just then was inclined to undertake so that the knock afforded a
not unwelcome diversion

Walk in said the shepherd promptly

The latch clicked upward and out of the night our pedestrian appeared
upon the doormat The shepherd arose snuffed two of the nearest
candles and turned to look at him

Their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not
unprepossessing as to feature His hat which for a moment he did not
remove hung low over his eyes without concealing that they were large
open and determined moving with a flash rather than a glance round the
room He seemed pleased with his survey and baring his shaggy head
said in a rich deep voice The rain is so heavy friends that I ask
leave to come in and rest awhile

To be sure stranger said the shepherd And faith youve been lucky
in choosing your time for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad
causethough to be sure a man could hardly wish that glad cause to
happen more than once a year

Nor less spoke up a woman For tis best to get your family over and
done with as soon as you can so as to be all the earlier out of the fag
ot

And what may be this glad cause asked the stranger

A birth and christening said the shepherd

The stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many
or too few of such episodes and being invited by a gesture to a pull at
the mug he readily acquiesced His manner which before entering had
been so dubious was now altogether that of a careless and candid man

Late to be traipsing athwart this coombhey said the engaged man of
fifty

Late it is master as you sayIll take a seat in the chimneycorner
if you have nothing to urge against it maam for I am a little moist on
the side that was next the rain

Mrs Shepherd Fennel assented and made room for the selfinvited comer
who having got completely inside the chimneycorner stretched out his
legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home

Yes I am rather cracked in the vamp he said freely seeing that the
eyes of the shepherds wife fell upon his boots and I am not well
fitted either I have had some rough times lately and have been forced
to pick up what I can get in the way of wearing but I must find a suit
better fit for workingdays when I reach home

One of hereabouts she inquired

Not quite thatfurther up the country

I thought so And so be I and by your tongue you come from my
neighbourhood

But you would hardly have heard of me he said quickly My time would
be long before yours maam you see

This testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of
stopping her crossexamination

There is only one thing more wanted to make me happy continued the new
comer And that is a little baccy which I am sorry to say I am out
of

Ill fill your pipe said the shepherd

I must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise

A smoker and no pipe about ee

I have dropped it somewhere on the road

The shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe saying as he did so
Hand me your baccyboxIll fill that too now I am about it

The man went through the movement of searching his pockets

Lost that too said his entertainer with some surprise

I am afraid so said the man with some confusion Give it to me in a
screw of paper Lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that
drew the whole flame into the bowl he resettled himself in the corner
and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs as if he
wished to say no more

Meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of
this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were
engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance The matter being
settled they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the
shape of another knock at the door

At sound of the same the man in the chimneycorner took up the poker and
began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of
his existence and a second time the shepherd said Walk in In a
moment another man stood upon the strawwoven doormat He too was a
stranger

This individual was one of a type radically different from the first
There was more of the commonplace in his manner and a certain jovial
cosmopolitanism sat upon his features He was several years older than
the first arrival his hair being slightly frosted his eyebrows bristly
and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks His face was rather full and
flabby and yet it was not altogether a face without power A few grog
blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose He flung back his long
drab greatcoat revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cindergray
shade throughout large heavy seals of some metal or other that would
take a polish dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament
Shaking the waterdrops from his lowcrowned glazed hat he said I must
ask for a few minutes shelter comrades or I shall be wetted to my skin
before I get to Casterbridge

Make yourself at home master said the shepherd perhaps a trifle less
heartily than on the first occasion Not that Fennel had the least tinge
of niggardliness in his composition but the room was far from large
spare chairs were not numerous and damp companions were not altogether
desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their
brightcoloured gowns

However the second comer after taking off his greatcoat and hanging
his hat on a nail in one of the ceilingbeams as if he had been specially
invited to put it there advanced and sat down at the table This had
been pushed so closely into the chimneycorner to give all available
room to the dancers that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who
had ensconced himself by the fire and thus the two strangers were
brought into close companionship They nodded to each other by way of
breaking the ice of unacquaintance and the first stranger handed his
neighbour the family muga huge vessel of brown ware having its upper
edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of
thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh and bearing the
following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters

 THERE IS NO FUN
 UNTiLL i CUM

The other man nothing loth raised the mug to his lips and drank on
and on and ontill a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the
shepherds wife who had regarded with no little surprise the first
strangers free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to
dispense

I knew it said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction When
I walked up your garden before coming in and saw the hives all of a row
I said to myself Where theres bees theres honey and where theres
honey theres mead But mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this I
really didnt expect to meet in my older days He took yet another pull
at the mug till it assumed an ominous elevation

Glad you enjoy it said the shepherd warmly

It is goodish mead assented Mrs Fennel with an absence of enthusiasm
which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for ones cellar
at too heavy a price It is trouble enough to makeand really I hardly
think we shall make any more For honey sells well and we ourselves can
make shift with a drop o small mead and metheglin for common use from
the combwashings

O but youll never have the heart reproachfully cried the stranger in
cindergray after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down
empty I love mead when tis old like this as I love to go to church
o Sundays or to relieve the needy any day of the week

Ha ha ha said the man in the chimneycorner who in spite of the
taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco could not or would not
refrain from this slight testimony to his comrades humour

Now the old mead of those days brewed of the purest firstyear or maiden
honey four pounds to the gallonwith its due complement of white of
eggs cinnamon ginger cloves mace rosemary yeast and processes of
working bottling and cellaringtasted remarkably strong but it did
not taste so strong as it actually was Hence presently the stranger
in cindergray at the table moved by its creeping influence unbuttoned
his waistcoat threw himself back in his chair spread his legs and made
his presence felt in various ways

Well well as I say he resumed I am going to Casterbridge and to
Casterbridge I must go I should have been almost there by this time
but the rain drove me into your dwelling and Im not sorry for it

You dont live in Casterbridge said the shepherd

Not as yet though I shortly mean to move there

Going to set up in trade perhaps

No no said the shepherds wife It is easy to see that the
gentleman is rich and dont want to work at anything

The cindergray stranger paused as if to consider whether he would
accept that definition of himself He presently rejected it by
answering Rich is not quite the word for me dame I do work and I
must work And even if I only get to Casterbridge by midnight I must
begin work there at eight tomorrow morning Yes het or wet blow or
snow famine or sword my days work tomorrow must be done

Poor man Then in spite o seeming you be worse off than we replied
the shepherds wife

Tis the nature of my trade men and maidens Tis the nature of my
trade more than my poverty    But really and truly I must up and off
or I shant get a lodging in the town However the speaker did not
move and directly added Theres time for one more draught of
friendship before I go and Id perform it at once if the mug were not
dry

Heres a mug o small said Mrs Fennel Small we call it though to
be sure tis only the first wash o the combs

No said the stranger disdainfully I wont spoil your first kindness
by partaking o your second

Certainly not broke in Fennel We dont increase and multiply every
day and Ill fill the mug again He went away to the dark place under
the stairs where the barrel stood The shepherdess followed him

Why should you do this she said reproachfully as soon as they were
alone Hes emptied it once though it held enough for ten people and
now hes not contented wi the small but must needs call for more o the
strong And a stranger unbeknown to any of us For my part I dont
like the look o the man at all

But hes in the house my honey and tis a wet night and a
christening Daze it whats a cup of mead more or less Therell be
plenty more next beeburning

Very wellthis time then she answered looking wistfully at the
barrel But what is the mans calling and where is he one of that he
should come in and join us like this

I dont know Ill ask him again

The catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger
in cindergray was effectually guarded against this time by Mrs Fennel
She poured out his allowance in a small cup keeping the large one at a
discreet distance from him When he had tossed off his portion the
shepherd renewed his inquiry about the strangers occupation

The latter did not immediately reply and the man in the chimneycorner
with sudden demonstrativeness said Anybody may know my tradeIm a
wheelwright

A very good trade for these parts said the shepherd

And anybody may know mineif theyve the sense to find it out said
the stranger in cindergray

You may generally tell what a man is by his claws observed the hedge
carpenter looking at his own hands My fingers be as full of thorns as
an old pincushion is of pins

The hands of the man in the chimneycorner instinctively sought the
shade and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe The man at the
table took up the hedgecarpenters remark and added smartly True but
the oddity of my trade is that instead of setting a mark upon me it
sets a mark upon my customers

No observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma
the shepherds wife once more called for a song The same obstacles
presented themselves as at the former timeone had no voice another had
forgotten the first verse The stranger at the table whose soul had now
risen to a good working temperature relieved the difficulty by
exclaiming that to start the company he would sing himself Thrusting
one thumb into the armhole of his waistcoat he waved the other hand in
the air and with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheepcrooks
above the mantelpiece began

 O my trade it is the rarest one
 Simple shepherds all 
 My trade is a sight to see
 For my customers I tie and take them up on high
 And waft em to a far countree

The room was silent when he had finished the versewith one exception
that of the man in the chimneycorner who at the singers word
Chorus joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish 

 And waft em to a far countree

Oliver Giles John Pitcher the dairyman the parishclerk the engaged
man of fifty the row of young women against the wall seemed lost in
thought not of the gayest kind The shepherd looked meditatively on the
ground the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer and with some
suspicion she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an
old song from recollection or was composing one there and then for the
occasion All were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests
at Belshazzars Feast except the man in the chimneycorner who quietly
said Second verse stranger and smoked on

The singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards and went
on with the next stanza as requested

 My tools are but common ones
 Simple shepherds all 
 My tools are no sight to see
 A little hempen string and a post whereon to swing
 Are implements enough for me

Shepherd Fennel glanced round There was no longer any doubt that the
stranger was answering his question rhythmically The guests one and all
started back with suppressed exclamations The young woman engaged to
the man of fifty fainted halfway and would have proceeded but finding
him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling

O hes the whispered the people in the background mentioning the
name of an ominous public officer Hes come to do it Tis to be at
Casterbridge jail tomorrowthe man for sheepstealingthe poor clock
maker we heard of who used to live away at Shottsford and had no work to
doTimothy Summers whose family were astarving and so he went out of
Shottsford by the highroad and took a sheep in open daylight defying
the farmer and the farmers wife and the farmers lad and every man jack
among em He and they nodded towards the stranger of the deadly
trade is come from up the country to do it because theres not enough
to do in his own countytown and hes got the place here now our own
county mans dead hes going to live in the same cottage under the
prison wall

The stranger in cindergray took no notice of this whispered string of
observations but again wetted his lips Seeing that his friend in the
chimneycorner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any
way he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade who also held
out his own They clinked together the eyes of the rest of the room
hanging upon the singers actions He parted his lips for the third
verse but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door This
time the knock was faint and hesitating

The company seemed scared the shepherd looked with consternation towards
the entrance and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed
wifes deprecatory glance and uttered for the third time the welcoming
words Walk in

The door was gently opened and another man stood upon the mat He like
those who had preceded him was a stranger This time it was a short
small personage of fair complexion and dressed in a decent suit of dark
clothes

Can you tell me the way to he began when gazing round the room to
observe the nature of the company amongst whom he had fallen his eyes
lighted on the stranger in cindergray It was just at the instant when
the latter who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that
he scarcely heeded the interruption silenced all whispers and inquiries
by bursting into his third verse

 Tomorrow is my working day
 Simple shepherds all 
 Tomorrow is a working day for me
 For the farmers sheep is slain and the lad who did it taen
 And on his soul may God ha mercy

The stranger in the chimneycorner waving cups with the singer so
heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth repeated in his bass
voice as before

 And on his soul may God ha mercy

All this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway
Finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking the guests
particularly regarded him They noticed to their surprise that he stood
before them the picture of abject terrorhis knees trembling his hand
shaking so violently that the doorlatch by which he supported himself
rattled audibly his white lips were parted and his eyes fixed on the
merry officer of justice in the middle of the room A moment more and he
had turned closed the door and fled

What a man can it be said the shepherd

The rest between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd
conduct of this third visitor looked as if they knew not what to think
and said nothing Instinctively they withdrew further and further from
the grim gentleman in their midst whom some of them seemed to take for
the Prince of Darkness himself till they formed a remote circle an
empty space of floor being left between them and him 

     circulus cujus centrum diabolus

The room was so silentthough there were more than twenty people in
itthat nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the
windowshutters accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that
fell down the chimney into the fire and the steady puffing of the man in
the corner who had now resumed his pipe of long clay

The stillness was unexpectedly broken The distant sound of a gun
reverberated through the airapparently from the direction of the county
town

Be jiggered cried the stranger who had sung the song jumping up

What does that mean asked several

A prisoner escaped from the jailthats what it means

All listened The sound was repeated and none of them spoke but the man
in the chimneycorner who said quietly Ive often been told that in
this county they fire a gun at such times but I never heard it till
now

I wonder if it is my man murmured the personage in cindergray

Surely it is said the shepherd involuntarily And surely weve zeed
him That little man who looked in at the door by now and quivered like
a leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song

His teeth chattered and the breath went out of his body said the
dairyman

And his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone said Oliver
Giles

And he bolted as if hed been shot at said the hedgecarpenter

Truehis teeth chattered and his heart seemed to sink and he bolted
as if hed been shot at slowly summed up the man in the chimneycorner

I didnt notice it remarked the hangman

We were all awondering what made him run off in such a fright
faltered one of the women against the wall and now tis explained

The firing of the alarmgun went on at intervals low and sullenly and
their suspicions became a certainty The sinister gentleman in cinder
gray roused himself Is there a constable here he asked in thick
tones If so let him step forward

The engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall his
betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair

You are a sworn constable

I be sir

Then pursue the criminal at once with assistance and bring him back
here He cant have gone far

I will sir I willwhen Ive got my staff Ill go home and get it
and come sharp here and start in a body

Staffnever mind your staff the manll be gone

But I cant do nothing without my staffcan I William and John and
Charles Jake No for theres the kings royal crown a painted on en in
yaller and gold and the lion and the unicorn so as when I raise en up
and hit my prisoner tis made a lawful blow thereby I wouldnt tempt
to take up a man without my staffno not I If I hadnt the law to gie
me courage why instead o my taking up him he might take up me

Now Im a kings man myself and can give you authority enough for
this said the formidable officer in gray Now then all of ye be
ready Have ye any lanterns

Yeshave ye any lanternsI demand it said the constable

And the rest of you ablebodied

Ablebodied menyesthe rest of ye said the constable

Have you some good stout staves and pitchforks

Staves and pitchforksin the name o the law And take em in yer
hands and go in quest and do as we in authority tell ye

Thus aroused the men prepared to give chase The evidence was indeed
though circumstantial so convincing that but little argument was needed
to show the shepherds guests that after what they had seen it would look
very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy
third stranger who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred
yards over such uneven country

A shepherd is always well provided with lanterns and lighting these
hastily and with hurdlestaves in their hands they poured out of the
door taking a direction along the crest of the hill away from the town
the rain having fortunately a little abated

Disturbed by the noise or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism
the child who had been christened began to cry heartbrokenly in the room
overhead These notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor
to the ears of the women below who jumped up one by one and seemed glad
of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby for the incidents of the
last halfhour greatly oppressed them Thus in the space of two or three
minutes the room on the groundfloor was deserted quite

But it was not for long Hardly had the sound of footsteps died away
when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the
pursuers had taken Peeping in at the door and seeing nobody there he
entered leisurely It was the stranger of the chimneycorner who had
gone out with the rest The motive of his return was shown by his
helping himself to a cut piece of skimmercake that lay on a ledge beside
where he had sat and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him
He also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained
ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood He had not finished
when another figure came in just as quietlyhis friend in cindergray

Oyou here said the latter smiling I thought you had gone to help
in the capture And this speaker also revealed the object of his return
by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead

And I thought you had gone said the other continuing his skimmercake
with some effort

Well on second thoughts I felt there were enough without me said the
first confidentially and such a night as it is too Besides tis the
business o the Government to take care of its criminalsnot mine

True so it is And I felt as you did that there were enough without
me

I dont want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of
this wild country

Nor I neither between you and me

These shepherdpeople are used to itsimpleminded souls you know
stirred up to anything in a moment Theyll have him ready for me before
the morning and no trouble to me at all

Theyll have him and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the
matter

True true Well my way is to Casterbridge and tis as much as my
legs will do to take me that far Going the same way

No I am sorry to say I have to get home over there he nodded
indefinitely to the right and I feel as you do that it is quite
enough for my legs to do before bedtime

The other had by this time finished the mead in the mug after which
shaking hands heartily at the door and wishing each other well they
went their several ways

In the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hogs
back elevation which dominated this part of the down They had decided
on no particular plan of action and finding that the man of the baleful
trade was no longer in their company they seemed quite unable to form
any such plan now They descended in all directions down the hill and
straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by Nature for
all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous
formation The lanchets or flint slopes which belted the escarpment
at intervals of a dozen yards took the less cautious ones unawares and
losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards the
lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom and there lying on their
sides till the horn was scorched through

When they had again gathered themselves together the shepherd as the
man who knew the country best took the lead and guided them round these
treacherous inclines The lanterns which seemed rather to dazzle their
eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration were
extinguished due silence was observed and in this more rational order
they plunged into the vale It was a grassy briery moist defile
affording some shelter to any person who had sought it but the party
perambulated it in vain and ascended on the other side Here they
wandered apart and after an interval closed together again to report
progress

At the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash
the single tree on this part of the coomb probably sown there by a
passing bird some fifty years before And here standing a little to one
side of the trunk as motionless as the trunk itself appeared the man
they were in quest of his outline being well defined against the sky
beyond The band noiselessly drew up and faced him

Your money or your life said the constable sternly to the still
figure

No no whispered John Pitcher Tisnt our side ought to say that
Thats the doctrine of vagabonds like him and we be on the side of the
law

Well well replied the constable impatiently I must say something
mustnt I and if you had all the weight o this undertaking upon your
mind perhaps youd say the wrong thing tooPrisoner at the bar
surrender in the name of the Fatherthe Crown I mane

The man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time and
giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage he
strolled slowly towards them He was indeed the little man the third
stranger but his trepidation had in a great measure gone

Well travellers he said did I hear ye speak to me

You did youve got to come and be our prisoner at once said the
constable We arrest ee on the charge of not biding in Casterbridge
jail in a decent proper manner to be hung tomorrow morning Neighbours
do your duty and seize the culpet

On hearing the charge the man seemed enlightened and saying not
another word resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search
party who with their staves in their hands surrounded him on all
sides and marched him back towards the shepherds cottage

It was eleven oclock by the time they arrived The light shining from
the open door a sound of mens voices within proclaimed to them as they
approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence On
entering they discovered the shepherds living room to be invaded by two
officers from Casterbridge jail and a wellknown magistrate who lived at
the nearest countryseat intelligence of the escape having become
generally circulated

Gentlemen said the constable I have brought back your mannot
without risk and danger but every one must do his duty He is inside
this circle of ablebodied persons who have lent me useful aid
considering their ignorance of Crown work Men bring forward your
prisoner And the third stranger was led to the light

Who is this said one of the officials

The man said the constable

Certainly not said the turnkey and the first corroborated his
statement

But how can it be otherwise asked the constable Or why was he so
terrified at sight o the singing instrument of the law who sat there
Here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering
the house during the hangmans song

Cant understand it said the officer coolly All I know is that it
is not the condemned man Hes quite a different character from this
one a gauntish fellow with dark hair and eyes rather goodlooking and
with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once youd never mistake
as long as you lived

Why soulstwas the man in the chimneycorner

Heywhat said the magistrate coming forward after inquiring
particulars from the shepherd in the background Havent you got the
man after all

Well sir said the constable hes the man we were in search of
thats true and yet hes not the man we were in search of For the man
we were in search of was not the man we wanted sir if you understand my
everyday way for twas the man in the chimneycorner

A pretty kettle of fish altogether said the magistrate You had
better start for the other man at once

The prisoner now spoke for the first time The mention of the man in the
chimneycorner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do Sir
he said stepping forward to the magistrate take no more trouble about
me The time is come when I may as well speak I have done nothing my
crime is that the condemned man is my brother Early this afternoon I
left home at Shottsford to tramp it all the way to Casterbridge jail to
bid him farewell I was benighted and called here to rest and ask the
way When I opened the door I saw before me the very man my brother
that I thought to see in the condemned cell at Casterbridge He was in
this chimneycorner and jammed close to him so that he could not have
got out if he had tried was the executioner whod come to take his life
singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was
close by joining in to save appearances My brother looked a glance of
agony at me and I knew he meant Dont reveal what you see my life
depends on it I was so terrorstruck that I could hardly stand and
not knowing what I did I turned and hurried away

The narrators manner and tone had the stamp of truth and his story made
a great impression on all around And do you know where your brother is
at the present time asked the magistrate

I do not I have never seen him since I closed this door

I can testify to that for weve been between ye ever since said the
constable

Where does he think to fly towhat is his occupation

Hes a watchandclockmaker sir

A said a was a wheelwrighta wicked rogue said the constable

The wheels of clocks and watches he meant no doubt said Shepherd
Fennel I thought his hands were palish fors trade

Well it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor
man in custody said the magistrate your business lies with the other
unquestionably

And so the little man was released offhand but he looked nothing the
less sad on that account it being beyond the power of magistrate or
constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain for they
concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself
When this was done and the man had gone his way the night was found to
be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before
the next morning

Next day accordingly the quest for the clever sheepstealer became
general and keen to all appearance at least But the intended
punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression and the
sympathy of a great many countryfolk in that district was strongly on
the side of the fugitive Moreover his marvellous coolness and daring
in hobandnobbing with the hangman under the unprecedented
circumstances of the shepherds party won their admiration So that it
may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in
exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came
to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses Stories
were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old
overgrown trackway or other remote from turnpike roads but when a
search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was
found Thus the days and weeks passed without tidings

In brief the bassvoiced man of the chimneycorner was never recaptured
Some said that he went across the sea others that he did not but buried
himself in the depths of a populous city At any rate the gentleman in
cindergray never did his mornings work at Casterbridge nor met
anywhere at all for business purposes the genial comrade with whom he
had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb

The grass has long been green on the graves of Shepherd Fennel and his
frugal wife the guests who made up the christening party have mainly
followed their entertainers to the tomb the baby in whose honour they
all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf But the arrival of
the three strangers at the shepherds that night and the details
connected therewith is a story as well known as ever in the country
about Higher Crowstairs

March 1883




THE WITHERED ARM


CHAPTER IA LORN MILKMAID


It was an eightycow dairy and the troop of milkers regular and
supernumerary were all at work for though the time of year was as yet
but early April the feed lay entirely in watermeadows and the cows
were in full pail The hour was about six in the evening and three
fourths of the large red rectangular animals having been finished off
there was opportunity for a little conversation

He do bring home his bride tomorrow I hear Theyve come as far as
Anglebury today

The voice seemed to proceed from the belly of the cow called Cherry but
the speaker was a milkingwoman whose face was buried in the flank of
that motionless beast

Hav anybody seen her said another

There was a negative response from the first Though they say shes a
rosycheeked tistytosty little body enough she added and as the
milkmaid spoke she turned her face so that she could glance past her
cows tail to the other side of the barton where a thin fading woman of
thirty milked somewhat apart from the rest

Years younger than he they say continued the second with also a
glance of reflectiveness in the same direction

How old do you call him then

Thirty or so

More like forty broke in an old milkman near in a long white pinafore
or wropper and with the brim of his hat tied down so that he looked
like a woman A was born before our Great Weir was builded and I
hadnt mans wages when I laved water there

The discussion waxed so warm that the purr of the milkstreams became
jerky till a voice from another cows belly cried with authority Now
then what the Turk do it matter to us about Farmer Lodges age or
Farmer Lodges new misess I shall have to pay him nine pound a year
for the rent of every one of these milchers whatever his age or hers
Get on with your work or twill be dark afore we have done The evening
is pinking in aready This speaker was the dairyman himself by whom
the milkmaids and men were employed

Nothing more was said publicly about Farmer Lodges wedding but the
first woman murmured under her cow to her next neighbour Tis hard for
she signifying the thin worn milkmaid aforesaid

O no said the second He hant spoke to Rhoda Brook for years

When the milking was done they washed their pails and hung them on a many
forked stand made of the peeled limb of an oaktree set upright in the
earth and resembling a colossal antlered horn The majority then
dispersed in various directions homeward The thin woman who had not
spoken was joined by a boy of twelve or thereabout and the twain went
away up the field also

Their course lay apart from that of the others to a lonely spot high
above the watermeads and not far from the border of Egdon Heath whose
dark countenance was visible in the distance as they drew nigh to their
home

Theyve just been saying down in barton that your father brings his
young wife home from Anglebury tomorrow the woman observed I shall
want to send you for a few things to market and youll be pretty sure to
meet em

Yes mother said the boy Is father married then

Yes    You can give her a look and tell me whats shes like if you
do see her

Yes mother

If shes dark or fair and if shes tallas tall as I And if she
seems like a woman who has ever worked for a living or one that has been
always well off and has never done anything and shows marks of the lady
on her as I expect she do

Yes

They crept up the hill in the twilight and entered the cottage It was
built of mudwalls the surface of which had been washed by many rains
into channels and depressions that left none of the original flat face
visible while here and there in the thatch above a rafter showed like a
bone protruding through the skin

She was kneeling down in the chimneycorner before two pieces of turf
laid together with the heather inwards blowing at the redhot ashes with
her breath till the turves flamed The radiance lit her pale cheek and
made her dark eyes that had once been handsome seem handsome anew
Yes she resumed see if she is dark or fair and if you can notice
if her hands be white if not see if they look as though she had ever
done housework or are milkers hands like mine

The boy again promised inattentively this time his mother not observing
that he was cutting a notch with his pocketknife in the beechbacked
chair



CHAPTER IITHE YOUNG WIFE


The road from Anglebury to Holmstoke is in general level but there is
one place where a sharp ascent breaks its monotony Farmers homeward
bound from the former markettown who trot all the rest of the way walk
their horses up this short incline

The next evening while the sun was yet bright a handsome new gig with
a lemoncoloured body and red wheels was spinning westward along the
level highway at the heels of a powerful mare The driver was a yeoman
in the prime of life cleanly shaven like an actor his face being toned
to that bluishvermilion hue which so often graces a thriving farmers
features when returning home after successful dealings in the town
Beside him sat a woman many years his junioralmost indeed a girl
Her face too was fresh in colour but it was of a totally different
qualitysoft and evanescent like the light under a heap of rosepetals

Few people travelled this way for it was not a main road and the long
white riband of gravel that stretched before them was empty save of one
small scarcemoving speck which presently resolved itself into the
figure of boy who was creeping on at a snails pace and continually
looking behind himthe heavy bundle he carried being some excuse for if
not the reason of his dilatoriness When the bouncing gigparty slowed
at the bottom of the incline above mentioned the pedestrian was only a
few yards in front Supporting the large bundle by putting one hand on
his hip he turned and looked straight at the farmers wife as though he
would read her through and through pacing along abreast of the horse

The low sun was full in her face rendering every feature shade and
contour distinct from the curve of her little nostril to the colour of
her eyes The farmer though he seemed annoyed at the boys persistent
presence did not order him to get out of the way and thus the lad
preceded them his hard gaze never leaving her till they reached the top
of the ascent when the farmer trotted on with relief in his
lineamentshaving taken no outward notice of the boy whatever

How that poor lad stared at me said the young wife

Yes dear I saw that he did

He is one of the village I suppose

One of the neighbourhood I think he lives with his mother a mile or
two off

He knows who we are no doubt

O yes You must expect to be stared at just at first my pretty
Gertrude

I dothough I think the poor boy may have looked at us in the hope we
might relieve him of his heavy load rather than from curiosity

O no said her husband offhandedly These country lads will carry a
hundredweight once they get it on their backs besides his pack had more
size than weight in it Now then another mile and I shall be able to
show you our house in the distanceif it is not too dark before we get
there The wheels spun round and particles flew from their periphery
as before till a white house of ample dimensions revealed itself with
farmbuildings and ricks at the back

Meanwhile the boy had quickened his pace and turning up a bylane some
mile and half short of the white farmstead ascended towards the leaner
pastures and so on to the cottage of his mother

She had reached home after her days milking at the outlying dairy and
was washing cabbage at the doorway in the declining light Hold up the
net a moment she said without preface as the boy came up

He flung down his bundle held the edge of the cabbagenet and as she
filled its meshes with the dripping leaves she went on Well did you
see her

Yes quite plain

Is she ladylike

Yes and more A lady complete

Is she young

Well shes growed up and her ways be quite a womans

Of course What colour is her hair and face

Her hair is lightish and her face as comely as a live dolls

Her eyes then are not dark like mine

Noof a bluish turn and her mouth is very nice and red and when she
smiles her teeth show white

Is she tall said the woman sharply

I couldnt see She was sitting down

Then do you go to Holmstoke church tomorrow morning shes sure to be
there Go early and notice her walking in and come home and tell me if
shes taller than I

Very well mother But why dont you go and see for yourself

I go to see her I wouldnt look up at her if she were to pass my
window this instant She was with Mr Lodge of course What did he say
or do

Just the same as usual

Took no notice of you

None

Next day the mother put a clean shirt on the boy and started him off for
Holmstoke church He reached the ancient little pile when the door was
just being opened and he was the first to enter Taking his seat by the
font he watched all the parishioners file in The welltodo Farmer
Lodge came nearly last and his young wife who accompanied him walked
up the aisle with the shyness natural to a modest woman who had appeared
thus for the first time As all other eyes were fixed upon her the
youths stare was not noticed now

When he reached home his mother said Well before he had entered the
room

She is not tall She is rather short he replied

Ah said his mother with satisfaction

But shes very prettyvery In fact shes lovely

The youthful freshness of the yeomans wife had evidently made an
impression even on the somewhat hard nature of the boy

Thats all I want to hear said his mother quickly Now spread the
tablecloth The hare you caught is very tender but mind that nobody
catches youYouve never told me what sort of hands she had

I have never seen em She never took off her gloves

What did she wear this morning

A white bonnet and a silvercoloured gownd It whewed and whistled so
loud when it rubbed against the pews that the lady coloured up more than
ever for very shame at the noise and pulled it in to keep it from
touching but when she pushed into her seat it whewed more than ever
Mr Lodge he seemed pleased and his waistcoat stuck out and his great
golden seals hung like a lords but she seemed to wish her noisy gownd
anywhere but on her

Not she However that will do now

These descriptions of the newlymarried couple were continued from time
to time by the boy at his mothers request after any chance encounter he
had had with them But Rhoda Brook though she might easily have seen
young Mrs Lodge for herself by walking a couple of miles would never
attempt an excursion towards the quarter where the farmhouse lay Neither
did she at the daily milking in the dairymans yard on Lodges outlying
second farm ever speak on the subject of the recent marriage The
dairyman who rented the cows of Lodge and knew perfectly the tall
milkmaids history with manly kindliness always kept the gossip in the
cowbarton from annoying Rhoda But the atmosphere thereabout was full
of the subject during the first days of Mrs Lodges arrival and from
her boys description and the casual words of the other milkers Rhoda
Brook could raise a mental image of the unconscious Mrs Lodge that was
realistic as a photograph



CHAPTER IIIA VISION


One night two or three weeks after the bridal return when the boy was
gone to bed Rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked
out in front of her to extinguish them She contemplated so intently the
new wife as presented to her in her minds eye over the embers that she
forgot the lapse of time At last wearied with her days work she too
retired

But the figure which had occupied her so much during this and the
previous days was not to be banished at night For the first time
Gertrude Lodge visited the supplanted woman in her dreams Rhoda Brook
dreamedsince her assertion that she really saw before falling asleep
was not to be believedthat the young wife in the pale silk dress and
white bonnet but with features shockingly distorted and wrinkled as by
age was sitting upon her chest as she lay The pressure of Mrs Lodges
person grew heavier the blue eyes peered cruelly into her face and then
the figure thrust forward its left hand mockingly so as to make the
weddingring it wore glitter in Rhodas eyes Maddened mentally and
nearly suffocated by pressure the sleeper struggled the incubus still
regarding her withdrew to the foot of the bed only however to come
forward by degrees resume her seat and flash her left hand as before

Gasping for breath Rhoda in a last desperate effort swung out her
right hand seized the confronting spectre by its obtrusive left arm and
whirled it backward to the floor starting up herself as she did so with
a low cry

O merciful heaven she cried sitting on the edge of the bed in a cold
sweat that was not a dreamshe was here

She could feel her antagonists arm within her grasp even nowthe very
flesh and bone of it as it seemed She looked on the floor whither she
had whirled the spectre but there was nothing to be seen

Rhoda Brook slept no more that night and when she went milking at the
next dawn they noticed how pale and haggard she looked The milk that
she drew quivered into the pail her hand had not calmed even yet and
still retained the feel of the arm She came home to breakfast as
wearily as if it had been suppertime

What was that noise in your chimmer mother last night said her son
You fell off the bed surely

Did you hear anything fall At what time

Just when the clock struck two

She could not explain and when the meal was done went silently about her
household work the boy assisting her for he hated going afield on the
farms and she indulged his reluctance Between eleven and twelve the
gardengate clicked and she lifted her eyes to the window At the
bottom of the garden within the gate stood the woman of her vision
Rhoda seemed transfixed

Ah she said she would come exclaimed the boy also observing her

Said sowhen How does she know us

I have seen and spoken to her I talked to her yesterday

I told you said the mother flushing indignantly never to speak to
anybody in that house or go near the place

I did not speak to her till she spoke to me And I did not go near the
place I met her in the road

What did you tell her

Nothing She said Are you the poor boy who had to bring the heavy
load from market And she looked at my boots and said they would not
keep my feet dry if it came on wet because they were so cracked I told
her I lived with my mother and we had enough to do to keep ourselves
and thats how it was and she said then Ill come and bring you some
better boots and see your mother She gives away things to other folks
in the meads besides us

Mrs Lodge was by this time close to the doornot in her silk as Rhoda
had seen her in the bedchamber but in a morning hat and gown of common
light material which became her better than silk On her arm she
carried a basket

The impression remaining from the nights experience was still strong
Brook had almost expected to see the wrinkles the scorn and the cruelty
on her visitors face

She would have escaped an interview had escape been possible There
was however no backdoor to the cottage and in an instant the boy had
lifted the latch to Mrs Lodges gentle knock

I see I have come to the right house said she glancing at the lad
and smiling But I was not sure till you opened the door

The figure and action were those of the phantom but her voice was so
indescribably sweet her glance so winning her smile so tender so
unlike that of Rhodas midnight visitant that the latter could hardly
believe the evidence of her senses She was truly glad that she had not
hidden away in sheer aversion as she had been inclined to do In her
basket Mrs Lodge brought the pair of boots that she had promised to the
boy and other useful articles

At these proofs of a kindly feeling towards her and hers Rhodas heart
reproached her bitterly This innocent young thing should have her
blessing and not her curse When she left them a light seemed gone from
the dwelling Two days later she came again to know if the boots fitted
and less than a fortnight after that paid Rhoda another call On this
occasion the boy was absent

I walk a good deal said Mrs Lodge and your house is the nearest
outside our own parish I hope you are well You dont look quite
well

Rhoda said she was well enough and indeed though the paler of the two
there was more of the strength that endures in her welldefined features
and large frame than in the softcheeked young woman before her The
conversation became quite confidential as regarded their powers and
weaknesses and when Mrs Lodge was leaving Rhoda said I hope you will
find this air agree with you maam and not suffer from the damp of the
watermeads

The younger one replied that there was not much doubt of it her general
health being usually good Though now you remind me she added I
have one little ailment which puzzles me It is nothing serious but I
cannot make it out

She uncovered her left hand and arm and their outline confronted Rhodas
gaze as the exact original of the limb she had beheld and seized in her
dream Upon the pink round surface of the arm were faint marks of an
unhealthy colour as if produced by a rough grasp Rhodas eyes became
riveted on the discolorations she fancied that she discerned in them the
shape of her own four fingers

How did it happen she said mechanically

I cannot tell replied Mrs Lodge shaking her head One night when I
was sound asleep dreaming I was away in some strange place a pain
suddenly shot into my arm there and was so keen as to awaken me I must
have struck it in the daytime I suppose though I dont remember doing
so She added laughing I tell my dear husband that it looks just as
if he had flown into a rage and struck me there O I daresay it will
soon disappear

Ha ha Yes    On what night did it come

Mrs Lodge considered and said it would be a fortnight ago on the
morrow When I awoke I could not remember where I was she added
till the clock striking two reminded me

She had named the night and the hour of Rhodas spectral encounter and
Brook felt like a guilty thing The artless disclosure startled her she
did not reason on the freaks of coincidence and all the scenery of that
ghastly night returned with double vividness to her mind

O can it be she said to herself when her visitor had departed that
I exercise a malignant power over people against my own will She knew
that she had been slily called a witch since her fall but never having
understood why that particular stigma had been attached to her it had
passed disregarded Could this be the explanation and had such things
as this ever happened before



CHAPTER IVA SUGGESTION


The summer drew on and Rhoda Brook almost dreaded to meet Mrs Lodge
again notwithstanding that her feeling for the young wife amounted well
nigh to affection Something in her own individuality seemed to convict
Rhoda of crime Yet a fatality sometimes would direct the steps of the
latter to the outskirts of Holmstoke whenever she left her house for any
other purpose than her daily work and hence it happened that their next
encounter was out of doors Rhoda could not avoid the subject which had
so mystified her and after the first few words she stammered I hope
yourarm is well again maam She had perceived with consternation
that Gertrude Lodge carried her left arm stiffly

No it is not quite well Indeed it is no better at all it is rather
worse It pains me dreadfully sometimes

Perhaps you had better go to a doctor maam

She replied that she had already seen a doctor Her husband had insisted
upon her going to one But the surgeon had not seemed to understand the
afflicted limb at all he had told her to bathe it in hot water and she
had bathed it but the treatment had done no good

Will you let me see it said the milkwoman

Mrs Lodge pushed up her sleeve and disclosed the place which was a few
inches above the wrist As soon as Rhoda Brook saw it she could hardly
preserve her composure There was nothing of the nature of a wound but
the arm at that point had a shrivelled look and the outline of the four
fingers appeared more distinct than at the former time Moreover she
fancied that they were imprinted in precisely the relative position of
her clutch upon the arm in the trance the first finger towards
Gertrudes wrist and the fourth towards her elbow

What the impress resembled seemed to have struck Gertrude herself since
their last meeting It looks almost like fingermarks she said
adding with a faint laugh my husband says it is as if some witch or
the devil himself had taken hold of me there and blasted the flesh

Rhoda shivered Thats fancy she said hurriedly I wouldnt mind
it if I were you

I shouldnt so much mind it said the younger with hesitation ifif
I hadnt a notion that it makes my husbanddislike meno love me less
Men think so much of personal appearance

Some dohe for one

Yes and he was very proud of mine at first

Keep your arm covered from his sight

Ahhe knows the disfigurement is there She tried to hide the tears
that filled her eyes

Well maam I earnestly hope it will go away soon

And so the milkwomans mind was chained anew to the subject by a horrid
sort of spell as she returned home The sense of having been guilty of
an act of malignity increased affect as she might to ridicule her
superstition In her secret heart Rhoda did not altogether object to a
slight diminution of her successors beauty by whatever means it had
come about but she did not wish to inflict upon her physical pain For
though this pretty young woman had rendered impossible any reparation
which Lodge might have made Rhoda for his past conduct everything like
resentment at the unconscious usurpation had quite passed away from the
elders mind

If the sweet and kindly Gertrude Lodge only knew of the scene in the bed
chamber what would she think Not to inform her of it seemed treachery
in the presence of her friendliness but tell she could not of her own
accordneither could she devise a remedy

She mused upon the matter the greater part of the night and the next
day after the morning milking set out to obtain another glimpse of
Gertrude Lodge if she could being held to her by a gruesome fascination
By watching the house from a distance the milkmaid was presently able to
discern the farmers wife in a ride she was taking aloneprobably to
join her husband in some distant field Mrs Lodge perceived her and
cantered in her direction

Good morning Rhoda Gertrude said when she had come up I was going
to call

Rhoda noticed that Mrs Lodge held the reins with some difficulty

I hopethe bad arm said Rhoda

They tell me there is possibly one way by which I might be able to find
out the cause and so perhaps the cure of it replied the other
anxiously It is by going to some clever man over in Egdon Heath They
did not know if he was still aliveand I cannot remember his name at
this moment but they said that you knew more of his movements than
anybody else hereabout and could tell me if he were still to be
consulted Dear mewhat was his name But you know

Not Conjuror Trendle said her thin companion turning pale

Trendleyes Is he alive

I believe so said Rhoda with reluctance

Why do you call him conjuror

Wellthey saythey used to say he was ahe had powers other folks
have not

O how could my people be so superstitious as to recommend a man of that
sort I thought they meant some medical man I shall think no more of
him

Rhoda looked relieved and Mrs Lodge rode on The milkwoman had
inwardly seen from the moment she heard of her having been mentioned as
a reference for this man that there must exist a sarcastic feeling among
the workfolk that a sorceress would know the whereabouts of the
exorcist They suspected her then A short time ago this would have
given no concern to a woman of her commonsense But she had a haunting
reason to be superstitious now and she had been seized with sudden dread
that this Conjuror Trendle might name her as the malignant influence
which was blasting the fair person of Gertrude and so lead her friend to
hate her for ever and to treat her as some fiend in human shape

But all was not over Two days after a shadow intruded into the window
pattern thrown on Rhoda Brooks floor by the afternoon sun The woman
opened the door at once almost breathlessly

Are you alone said Gertrude She seemed to be no less harassed and
anxious than Brook herself

Yes said Rhoda

The place on my arm seems worse and troubles me the young farmers
wife went on It is so mysterious I do hope it will not be an
incurable wound I have again been thinking of what they said about
Conjuror Trendle I dont really believe in such men but I should not
mind just visiting him from curiositythough on no account must my
husband know Is it far to where he lives

Yesfive miles said Rhoda backwardly In the heart of Egdon

Well I should have to walk Could not you go with me to show me the
waysay tomorrow afternoon

O not Ithat is the milkwoman murmured with a start of dismay
Again the dread seized her that something to do with her fierce act in
the dream might be revealed and her character in the eyes of the most
useful friend she had ever had be ruined irretrievably

Mrs Lodge urged and Rhoda finally assented though with much misgiving
Sad as the journey would be to her she could not conscientiously stand
in the way of a possible remedy for her patrons strange affliction It
was agreed that to escape suspicion of their mystic intent they should
meet at the edge of the heath at the corner of a plantation which was
visible from the spot where they now stood



CHAPTER VCONJUROR TRENDLE


By the next afternoon Rhoda would have done anything to escape this
inquiry But she had promised to go Moreover there was a horrid
fascination at times in becoming instrumental in throwing such possible
light on her own character as would reveal her to be something greater in
the occult world than she had ever herself suspected

She started just before the time of day mentioned between them and half
anhours brisk walking brought her to the southeastern extension of the
Egdon tract of country where the fir plantation was A slight figure
cloaked and veiled was already there Rhoda recognized almost with a
shudder that Mrs Lodge bore her left arm in a sling

They hardly spoke to each other and immediately set out on their climb
into the interior of this solemn country which stood high above the rich
alluvial soil they had left halfanhour before It was a long walk
thick clouds made the atmosphere dark though it was as yet only early
afternoon and the wind howled dismally over the hills of the heathnot
improbably the same heath which had witnessed the agony of the Wessex
King Ina presented to afterages as Lear Gertrude Lodge talked most
Rhoda replying with monosyllabic preoccupation She had a strange
dislike to walking on the side of her companion where hung the afflicted
arm moving round to the other when inadvertently near it Much heather
had been brushed by their feet when they descended upon a carttrack
beside which stood the house of the man they sought

He did not profess his remedial practices openly or care anything about
their continuance his direct interests being those of a dealer in furze
turf sharp sand and other local products Indeed he affected not to
believe largely in his own powers and when warts that had been shown him
for cure miraculously disappearedwhich it must be owned they infallibly
didhe would say lightly O I only drink a glass of grog upon
emperhaps its all chance and immediately turn the subject

He was at home when they arrived having in fact seen them descending
into his valley He was a graybearded man with a reddish face and he
looked singularly at Rhoda the first moment he beheld her Mrs Lodge
told him her errand and then with words of selfdisparagement he
examined her arm

Medicine cant cure it he said promptly Tis the work of an enemy

Rhoda shrank into herself and drew back

An enemy What enemy asked Mrs Lodge

He shook his head Thats best known to yourself he said If you
like I can show the person to you though I shall not myself know who it
is I can do no more and dont wish to do that

She pressed him on which he told Rhoda to wait outside where she stood
and took Mrs Lodge into the room It opened immediately from the door
and as the latter remained ajar Rhoda Brook could see the proceedings
without taking part in them He brought a tumbler from the dresser
nearly filled it with water and fetching an egg prepared it in some
private way after which he broke it on the edge of the glass so that
the white went in and the yolk remained As it was getting gloomy he
took the glass and its contents to the window and told Gertrude to watch
them closely They leant over the table together and the milkwoman
could see the opaline hue of the eggfluid changing form as it sank in
the water but she was not near enough to define the shape that it
assumed

Do you catch the likeness of any face or figure as you look demanded
the conjuror of the young woman

She murmured a reply in tones so low as to be inaudible to Rhoda and
continued to gaze intently into the glass Rhoda turned and walked a
few steps away

When Mrs Lodge came out and her face was met by the light it appeared
exceedingly paleas pale as Rhodasagainst the sad dun shades of the
uplands garniture Trendle shut the door behind her and they at once
started homeward together But Rhoda perceived that her companion had
quite changed

Did he charge much she asked tentatively

O nonothing He would not take a farthing said Gertrude

And what did you see inquired Rhoda

Nothing Icare to speak of The constraint in her manner was
remarkable her face was so rigid as to wear an oldened aspect faintly
suggestive of the face in Rhodas bedchamber

Was it you who first proposed coming here Mrs Lodge suddenly
inquired after a long pause How very odd if you did

No But I am not sorry we have come all things considered she
replied For the first time a sense of triumph possessed her and she
did not altogether deplore that the young thing at her side should learn
that their lives had been antagonized by other influences than their own

The subject was no more alluded to during the long and dreary walk home
But in some way or other a story was whispered about the manydairied
lowland that winter that Mrs Lodges gradual loss of the use of her left
arm was owing to her being overlooked by Rhoda Brook The latter kept
her own counsel about the incubus but her face grew sadder and thinner
and in the spring she and her boy disappeared from the neighbourhood of
Holmstoke



CHAPTER VIA SECOND ATTEMPT


Halfadozen years passed away and Mr and Mrs Lodges married
experience sank into prosiness and worse The farmer was usually gloomy
and silent the woman whom he had wooed for her grace and beauty was
contorted and disfigured in the left limb moreover she had brought him
no child which rendered it likely that he would be the last of a family
who had occupied that valley for some two hundred years He thought of
Rhoda Brook and her son and feared this might be a judgment from heaven
upon him

The once blithehearted and enlightened Gertrude was changing into an
irritable superstitious woman whose whole time was given to
experimenting upon her ailment with every quack remedy she came across
She was honestly attached to her husband and was ever secretly hoping
against hope to win back his heart again by regaining some at least of
her personal beauty Hence it arose that her closet was lined with
bottles packets and ointmentpots of every descriptionnay bunches of
mystic herbs charms and books of necromancy which in her schoolgirl
time she would have ridiculed as folly

Damned if you wont poison yourself with these apothecary messes and
witch mixtures some time or other said her husband when his eye
chanced to fall upon the multitudinous array

She did not reply but turned her sad soft glance upon him in such heart
swollen reproach that he looked sorry for his words and added I only
meant it for your good you know Gertrude

Ill clear out the whole lot and destroy them said she huskily and
try such remedies no more

You want somebody to cheer you he observed I once thought of
adopting a boy but he is too old now And he is gone away I dont know
where

She guessed to whom he alluded for Rhoda Brooks story had in the course
of years become known to her though not a word had ever passed between
her husband and herself on the subject Neither had she ever spoken to
him of her visit to Conjuror Trendle and of what was revealed to her or
she thought was revealed to her by that solitary heathman

She was now fiveandtwenty but she seemed older

Six years of marriage and only a few months of love she sometimes
whispered to herself And then she thought of the apparent cause and
said with a tragic glance at her withering limb If I could only again
be as I was when he first saw me

She obediently destroyed her nostrums and charms but there remained a
hankering wish to try something elsesome other sort of cure altogether
She had never revisited Trendle since she had been conducted to the house
of the solitary by Rhoda against her will but it now suddenly occurred
to Gertrude that she would in a last desperate effort at deliverance
from this seeming curse again seek out the man if he yet lived He was
entitled to a certain credence for the indistinct form he had raised in
the glass had undoubtedly resembled the only woman in the world whoas
she now knew though not thencould have a reason for bearing her ill
will The visit should be paid

This time she went alone though she nearly got lost on the heath and
roamed a considerable distance out of her way Trendles house was
reached at last however he was not indoors and instead of waiting at
the cottage she went to where his bent figure was pointed out to her at
work a long way off Trendle remembered her and laying down the handful
of furzeroots which he was gathering and throwing into a heap he
offered to accompany her in her homeward direction as the distance was
considerable and the days were short So they walked together his head
bowed nearly to the earth and his form of a colour with it

You can send away warts and other excrescences I know she said why
cant you send away this And the arm was uncovered

You think too much of my powers said Trendle and I am old and weak
now too No no it is too much for me to attempt in my own person
What have ye tried

She named to him some of the hundred medicaments and counterspells which
she had adopted from time to time He shook his head

Some were good enough he said approvingly but not many of them for
such as this This is of the nature of a blight not of the nature of a
wound and if you ever do throw it off it will be all at once

If I only could

There is only one chance of doing it known to me It has never failed
in kindred afflictionsthat I can declare But it is hard to carry
out and especially for a woman

Tell me said she

You must touch with the limb the neck of a man whos been hanged

She started a little at the image he had raised

Before hes coldjust after hes cut down continued the conjuror
impassively

How can that do good

It will turn the blood and change the constitution But as I say to
do it is hard You must get into jail and wait for him when hes
brought off the gallows Lots have done it though perhaps not such
pretty women as you I used to send dozens for skin complaints But
that was in former times The last I sent was in 13near twenty years
ago

He had no more to tell her and when he had put her into a straight
track homeward turned and left her refusing all money as at first



CHAPTER VIIA RIDE


The communication sank deep into Gertrudes mind Her nature was rather
a timid one and probably of all remedies that the white wizard could
have suggested there was not one which would have filled her with so much
aversion as this not to speak of the immense obstacles in the way of its
adoption

Casterbridge the countytown was a dozen or fifteen miles off and
though in those days when men were executed for horsestealing arson
and burglary an assize seldom passed without a hanging it was not
likely that she could get access to the body of the criminal unaided And
the fear of her husbands anger made her reluctant to breathe a word of
Trendles suggestion to him or to anybody about him

She did nothing for months and patiently bore her disfigurement as
before But her womans nature craving for renewed love through the
medium of renewed beauty she was but twentyfive was ever stimulating
her to try what at any rate could hardly do her any harm What came
by a spell will go by a spell surely she would say Whenever her
imagination pictured the act she shrank in terror from the possibility of
it then the words of the conjuror It will turn your blood were seen
to be capable of a scientific no less than a ghastly interpretation the
mastering desire returned and urged her on again

There was at this time but one county paper and that her husband only
occasionally borrowed But oldfashioned days had oldfashioned means
and news was extensively conveyed by word of mouth from market to market
or from fair to fair so that whenever such an event as an execution was
about to take place few within a radius of twenty miles were ignorant of
the coming sight and so far as Holmstoke was concerned some
enthusiasts had been known to walk all the way to Casterbridge and back
in one day solely to witness the spectacle The next assizes were in
March and when Gertrude Lodge heard that they had been held she
inquired stealthily at the inn as to the result as soon as she could
find opportunity

She was however too late The time at which the sentences were to be
carried out had arrived and to make the journey and obtain admission at
such short notice required at least her husbands assistance She dared
not tell him for she had found by delicate experiment that these
smouldering village beliefs made him furious if mentioned partly because
he half entertained them himself It was therefore necessary to wait for
another opportunity

Her determination received a fillip from learning that two epileptic
children had attended from this very village of Holmstoke many years
before with beneficial results though the experiment had been strongly
condemned by the neighbouring clergy April May June passed and it
is no overstatement to say that by the end of the lastnamed month
Gertrude wellnigh longed for the death of a fellowcreature Instead of
her formal prayers each night her unconscious prayer was O Lord hang
some guilty or innocent person soon

This time she made earlier inquiries and was altogether more systematic
in her proceedings Moreover the season was summer between the
haymaking and the harvest and in the leisure thus afforded him her
husband had been holidaytaking away from home

The assizes were in July and she went to the inn as before There was
to be one executiononly onefor arson

Her greatest problem was not how to get to Casterbridge but what means
she should adopt for obtaining admission to the jail Though access for
such purposes had formerly never been denied the custom had fallen into
desuetude and in contemplating her possible difficulties she was again
almost driven to fall back upon her husband But on sounding him about
the assizes he was so uncommunicative so more than usually cold that
she did not proceed and decided that whatever she did she would do
alone

Fortune obdurate hitherto showed her unexpected favour On the
Thursday before the Saturday fixed for the execution Lodge remarked to
her that he was going away from home for another day or two on business
at a fair and that he was sorry he could not take her with him

She exhibited on this occasion so much readiness to stay at home that he
looked at her in surprise Time had been when she would have shown deep
disappointment at the loss of such a jaunt However he lapsed into his
usual taciturnity and on the day named left Holmstoke

It was now her turn She at first had thought of driving but on
reflection held that driving would not do since it would necessitate her
keeping to the turnpikeroad and so increase by tenfold the risk of her
ghastly errand being found out She decided to ride and avoid the
beaten track notwithstanding that in her husbands stables there was no
animal just at present which by any stretch of imagination could be
considered a ladys mount in spite of his promise before marriage to
always keep a mare for her He had however many carthorses fine ones
of their kind and among the rest was a serviceable creature an equine
Amazon with a back as broad as a sofa on which Gertrude had
occasionally taken an airing when unwell This horse she chose

On Friday afternoon one of the men brought it round She was dressed
and before going down looked at her shrivelled arm Ah she said to
it if it had not been for you this terrible ordeal would have been
saved me

When strapping up the bundle in which she carried a few articles of
clothing she took occasion to say to the servant I take these in case
I should not get back tonight from the person I am going to visit Dont
be alarmed if I am not in by ten and close up the house as usual I
shall be at home tomorrow for certain She meant then to privately
tell her husband the deed accomplished was not like the deed projected
He would almost certainly forgive her

And then the pretty palpitating Gertrude Lodge went from her husbands
homestead but though her goal was Casterbridge she did not take the
direct route thither through Stickleford Her cunning course at first
was in precisely the opposite direction As soon as she was out of
sight however she turned to the left by a road which led into Egdon
and on entering the heath wheeled round and set out in the true course
due westerly A more private way down the county could not be imagined
and as to direction she had merely to keep her horses head to a point a
little to the right of the sun She knew that she would light upon a
furzecutter or cottager of some sort from time to time from whom she
might correct her bearing

Though the date was comparatively recent Egdon was much less fragmentary
in character than now The attemptssuccessful and otherwiseat
cultivation on the lower slopes which intrude and break up the original
heath into small detached heaths had not been carried far Enclosure
Acts had not taken effect and the banks and fences which now exclude the
cattle of those villagers who formerly enjoyed rights of commonage
thereon and the carts of those who had turbary privileges which kept
them in firing all the year round were not erected Gertrude
therefore rode along with no other obstacles than the prickly furze
bushes the mats of heather the white watercourses and the natural
steeps and declivities of the ground

Her horse was sure if heavyfooted and slow and though a draught
animal was easypaced had it been otherwise she was not a woman who
could have ventured to ride over such a bit of country with a halfdead
arm It was therefore nearly eight oclock when she drew rein to breathe
the mare on the last outlying high point of heathland towards
Casterbridge previous to leaving Egdon for the cultivated valleys

She halted before a pool called Rushypond flanked by the ends of two
hedges a railing ran through the centre of the pond dividing it in
half Over the railing she saw the low green country over the green
trees the roofs of the town over the roofs a white flat facade denoting
the entrance to the county jail On the roof of this front specks were
moving about they seemed to be workmen erecting something Her flesh
crept She descended slowly and was soon amid cornfields and pastures
In another halfhour when it was almost dusk Gertrude reached the White
Hart the first inn of the town on that side

Little surprise was excited by her arrival farmers wives rode on
horseback then more than they do now though for that matter Mrs Lodge
was not imagined to be a wife at all the innkeeper supposed her some
harumskarum young woman who had come to attend hangfair next day
Neither her husband nor herself ever dealt in Casterbridge market so
that she was unknown While dismounting she beheld a crowd of boys
standing at the door of a harnessmakers shop just above the inn
looking inside it with deep interest

What is going on there she asked of the ostler

Making the rope for tomorrow

She throbbed responsively and contracted her arm

Tis sold by the inch afterwards the man continued I could get you
a bit miss for nothing if youd like

She hastily repudiated any such wish all the more from a curious
creeping feeling that the condemned wretchs destiny was becoming
interwoven with her own and having engaged a room for the night sat
down to think

Up to this time she had formed but the vaguest notions about her means of
obtaining access to the prison The words of the cunningman returned to
her mind He had implied that she should use her beauty impaired though
it was as a passkey In her inexperience she knew little about jail
functionaries she had heard of a highsheriff and an undersheriff but
dimly only She knew however that there must be a hangman and to the
hangman she determined to apply



CHAPTER VIIIA WATERSIDE HERMIT


At this date and for several years after there was a hangman to almost
every jail Gertrude found on inquiry that the Casterbridge official
dwelt in a lonely cottage by a deep slow river flowing under the cliff on
which the prison buildings were situatethe stream being the selfsame
one though she did not know it which watered the Stickleford and
Holmstoke meads lower down in its course

Having changed her dress and before she had eaten or drunkfor she
could not take her ease till she had ascertained some
particularsGertrude pursued her way by a path along the waterside to
the cottage indicated Passing thus the outskirts of the jail she
discerned on the level roof over the gateway three rectangular lines
against the sky where the specks had been moving in her distant view
she recognized what the erection was and passed quickly on Another
hundred yards brought her to the executioners house which a boy pointed
out It stood close to the same stream and was hard by a weir the waters
of which emitted a steady roar

While she stood hesitating the door opened and an old man came forth
shading a candle with one hand Locking the door on the outside he
turned to a flight of wooden steps fixed against the end of the cottage
and began to ascend them this being evidently the staircase to his
bedroom Gertrude hastened forward but by the time she reached the foot
of the ladder he was at the top She called to him loudly enough to be
heard above the roar of the weir he looked down and said What dye
want here

To speak to you a minute

The candlelight such as it was fell upon her imploring pale upturned
face and Davies as the hangman was called backed down the ladder I
was just going to bed he said Early to bed and early to rise but I
dont mind stopping a minute for such a one as you Come into house He
reopened the door and preceded her to the room within

The implements of his daily work which was that of a jobbing gardener
stood in a corner and seeing probably that she looked rural he said
If you want me to undertake country work I cant come for I never leave
Casterbridge for gentle nor simplenot I My real calling is officer of
justice he added formally

Yes yes Thats it Tomorrow

Ah I thought so Well whats the matter about that Tis no use to
come here about the knotfolks do come continually but I tell em one
knot is as merciful as another if ye keep it under the ear Is the
unfortunate man a relation or I should say perhaps looking at her
dress a person whos been in your employ

No What time is the execution

The same as usualtwelve oclock or as soon after as the London mail
coach gets in We always wait for that in case of a reprieve

Oa reprieveI hope not she said involuntarily

Wellhee heeas a matter of business so do I But still if ever
a young fellow deserved to be let off this one does only just turned
eighteen and only present by chance when the rick was fired Howsomever
theres not much risk of it as they are obliged to make an example of
him there having been so much destruction of property that way lately

I mean she explained that I want to touch him for a charm a cure of
an affliction by the advice of a man who has proved the virtue of the
remedy

O yes miss Now I understand Ive had such people come in past
years But it didnt strike me that you looked of a sort to require
bloodturning Whats the complaint The wrong kind for this Ill be
bound

My arm She reluctantly showed the withered skin

Ahtis all ascram said the hangman examining it

Yes said she

Well he continued with interest that is the class o subject Im
bound to admit I like the look of the place it is truly as suitable
for the cure as any I ever saw Twas a knowingman that sent ee
whoever he was

You can contrive for me all thats necessary she said breathlessly

You should really have gone to the governor of the jail and your doctor
with ee and given your name and addressthats how it used to be done
if I recollect Still perhaps I can manage it for a trifling fee

O thank you I would rather do it this way as I should like it kept
private

Lover not to know eh

Nohusband

Aha Very well Ill get ee a touch of the corpse

Where is it now she said shuddering

Ithe you mean hes living yet Just inside that little small
winder up there in the glum He signified the jail on the cliff above

She thought of her husband and her friends Yes of course she said
and how am I to proceed

He took her to the door Now do you be waiting at the little wicket in
the wall that youll find up there in the lane not later than one
oclock I will open it from the inside as I shant come home to dinner
till hes cut down Goodnight Be punctual and if you dont want
anybody to know ee wear a veil Ahonce I had such a daughter as
you

She went away and climbed the path above to assure herself that she
would be able to find the wicket next day Its outline was soon visible
to hera narrow opening in the outer wall of the prison precincts The
steep was so great that having reached the wicket she stopped a moment
to breathe and looking back upon the waterside cot saw the hangman
again ascending his outdoor staircase He entered the loft or chamber to
which it led and in a few minutes extinguished his light

The town clock struck ten and she returned to the White Hart as she had
come



CHAPTER IXA RENCOUNTER


It was one oclock on Saturday Gertrude Lodge having been admitted to
the jail as above described was sitting in a waitingroom within the
second gate which stood under a classic archway of ashlar then
comparatively modern and bearing the inscription COVNTY JAIL 1793
This had been the facade she saw from the heath the day before Near at
hand was a passage to the roof on which the gallows stood

The town was thronged and the market suspended but Gertrude had seen
scarcely a soul Having kept her room till the hour of the appointment
she had proceeded to the spot by a way which avoided the open space below
the cliff where the spectators had gathered but she could even now
hear the multitudinous babble of their voices out of which rose at
intervals the hoarse croak of a single voice uttering the words Last
dying speech and confession There had been no reprieve and the
execution was over but the crowd still waited to see the body taken
down

Soon the persistent girl heard a trampling overhead then a hand beckoned
to her and following directions she went out and crossed the inner
paved court beyond the gatehouse her knees trembling so that she could
scarcely walk One of her arms was out of its sleeve and only covered
by her shawl

On the spot at which she had now arrived were two trestles and before
she could think of their purpose she heard heavy feet descending stairs
somewhere at her back Turn her head she would not or could not and
rigid in this position she was conscious of a rough coffin passing her
shoulder borne by four men It was open and in it lay the body of a
young man wearing the smockfrock of a rustic and fustian breeches The
corpse had been thrown into the coffin so hastily that the skirt of the
smockfrock was hanging over The burden was temporarily deposited on the
trestles

By this time the young womans state was such that a gray mist seemed to
float before her eyes on account of which and the veil she wore she
could scarcely discern anything it was as though she had nearly died
but was held up by a sort of galvanism

Now said a voice close at hand and she was just conscious that the
word had been addressed to her

By a last strenuous effort she advanced at the same time hearing persons
approaching behind her She bared her poor curst arm and Davies
uncovering the face of the corpse took Gertrudes hand and held it so
that her arm lay across the dead mans neck upon a line the colour of an
unripe blackberry which surrounded it

Gertrude shrieked the turn o the blood predicted by the conjuror
had taken place But at that moment a second shriek rent the air of the
enclosure it was not Gertrudes and its effect upon her was to make her
start round

Immediately behind her stood Rhoda Brook her face drawn and her eyes
red with weeping Behind Rhoda stood Gertrudes own husband his
countenance lined his eyes dim but without a tear

Dn you what are you doing here he said hoarsely

Hussyto come between us and our child now cried Rhoda This is the
meaning of what Satan showed me in the vision You are like her at
last And clutching the bare arm of the younger woman she pulled her
unresistingly back against the wall Immediately Brook had loosened her
hold the fragile young Gertrude slid down against the feet of her
husband When he lifted her up she was unconscious

The mere sight of the twain had been enough to suggest to her that the
dead young man was Rhodas son At that time the relatives of an
executed convict had the privilege of claiming the body for burial if
they chose to do so and it was for this purpose that Lodge was awaiting
the inquest with Rhoda He had been summoned by her as soon as the young
man was taken in the crime and at different times since and he had
attended in court during the trial This was the holiday he had been
indulging in of late The two wretched parents had wished to avoid
exposure and hence had come themselves for the body a waggon and sheet
for its conveyance and covering being in waiting outside

Gertrudes case was so serious that it was deemed advisable to call to
her the surgeon who was at hand She was taken out of the jail into the
town but she never reached home alive Her delicate vitality sapped
perhaps by the paralyzed arm collapsed under the double shock that
followed the severe strain physical and mental to which she had
subjected herself during the previous twentyfour hours Her blood had
been turned indeedtoo far Her death took place in the town three
days after

Her husband was never seen in Casterbridge again once only in the old
marketplace at Anglebury which he had so much frequented and very
seldom in public anywhere Burdened at first with moodiness and remorse
he eventually changed for the better and appeared as a chastened and
thoughtful man Soon after attending the funeral of his poor young wife
he took steps towards giving up the farms in Holmstoke and the adjoining
parish and having sold every head of his stock he went away to Port
Bredy at the other end of the county living there in solitary lodgings
till his death two years later of a painless decline It was then found
that he had bequeathed the whole of his not inconsiderable property to a
reformatory for boys subject to the payment of a small annuity to Rhoda
Brook if she could be found to claim it

For some time she could not be found but eventually she reappeared in
her old parishabsolutely refusing however to have anything to do
with the provision made for her Her monotonous milking at the dairy was
resumed and followed for many long years till her form became bent and
her once abundant dark hair white and worn away at the foreheadperhaps
by long pressure against the cows Here sometimes those who knew her
experiences would stand and observe her and wonder what sombre thoughts
were beating inside that impassive wrinkled brow to the rhythm of the
alternating milkstreams

FELLOWTOWNSMEN


CHAPTER I


The shepherd on the east hill could shout out lambing intelligence to the
shepherd on the west hill over the intervening town chimneys without
great inconvenience to his voice so nearly did the steep pastures
encroach upon the burghers backyards And at night it was possible to
stand in the very midst of the town and hear from their native paddocks
on the lower levels of greensward the mild lowing of the farmers
heifers and the profound warm blowings of breath in which those
creatures indulge But the community which had jammed itself in the
valley thus flanked formed a veritable town with a real mayor and
corporation and a staple manufacture

During a certain damp evening fiveandthirty years ago before the
twilight was far advanced a pedestrian of professional appearance
carrying a small bag in his hand and an elevated umbrella was descending
one of these hills by the turnpike road when he was overtaken by a
phaeton

Hullo Downeis that you said the driver of the vehicle a young man
of pale and refined appearance Jump up here with me and ride down to
your door

The other turned a plump cheery rather selfindulgent face over his
shoulder towards the hailer

O good evening Mr Barnetthanks he said and mounted beside his
acquaintance

They were fellowburgesses of the town which lay beneath them but though
old and very good friends they were differently circumstanced Barnet
was a richer man than the struggling young lawyer Downe a fact which was
to some extent perceptible in Downes manner towards his companion
though nothing of it ever showed in Barnets manner towards the
solicitor Barnets position in the town was none of his own making his
father had been a very successful flaxmerchant in the same place where
the trade was still carried on as briskly as the small capacities of its
quarters would allow Having acquired a fair fortune old Mr Barnet had
retired from business bringing up his son as a gentlemanburgher and
it must be added as a welleducated liberalminded young man

How is Mrs Barnet asked Downe

Mrs Barnet was very well when I left home the other answered
constrainedly exchanging his meditative regard of the horse for one of
selfconsciousness

Mr Downe seemed to regret his inquiry and immediately took up another
thread of conversation He congratulated his friend on his election as a
councilman he thought he had not seen him since that event took place
Mrs Downe had meant to call and congratulate Mrs Barnet but he feared
that she had failed to do so as yet

Barnet seemed hampered in his replies We should have been glad to see
you Imy wife would welcome Mrs Downe at any time as you know   
Yes I am a member of the corporationrather an inexperienced member
some of them say It is quite true and I should have declined the
honour as prematurehaving other things on my hands just now tooif it
had not been pressed upon me so very heartily

There is one thing you have on your hands which I can never quite see
the necessity for said Downe with goodhumoured freedom What the
deuce do you want to build that new mansion for when you have already
got such an excellent house as the one you live in

Barnets face acquired a warmer shade of colour but as the question had
been idly asked by the solicitor while regarding the surrounding flocks
and fields he answered after a moment with no apparent embarrassment 

Well we wanted to get out of the town you know the house I am living
in is rather old and inconvenient Mr Downe declared that he had
chosen a pretty site for the new building They would be able to see for
miles and miles from the windows Was he going to give it a name He
supposed so

Barnet thought not There was no other house near that was likely to be
mistaken for it And he did not care for a name

But I think it has a name Downe observed I went pastwhen was
itthis morning and I saw somethingChateau Ringdale I think it
was stuck up on a board

It was an idea shewe had for a short time said Barnet hastily But
we have decided finally to do without a nameat any rate such a name as
that It must have been a week ago that you saw it It was taken down
last Saturday    Upon that matter I am firm he added grimly

Downe murmured in an unconvinced tone that he thought he had seen it
yesterday

Talking thus they drove into the town The street was unusually still
for the hour of seven in the evening an increasing drizzle had prevailed
since the afternoon and now formed a gauze across the yellow lamps and
trickled with a gentle rattle down the heavy roofs of stone tile that
bent the houseridges hollowbacked with its weight and in some
instances caused the walls to bulge outwards in the upper story Their
route took them past the little townhall the BlackBull Hotel and
onward to the junction of a small street on the right consisting of a
row of those twoandtwo windowed brick residences of no particular age
which are exactly alike wherever found except in the people they
contain

WaitIll drive you up to your door said Barnet when Downe prepared
to alight at the corner He thereupon turned into the narrow street
when the faces of three little girls could be discerned close to the
panes of a lighted window a few yards ahead surmounted by that of a
young matron the gaze of all four being directed eagerly up the empty
street You are a fortunate fellow Downe Barnet continued as mother
and children disappeared from the window to run to the door You must
be happy if any man is I would give a hundred such houses as my new one
to have a home like yours

Wellyes we get along pretty comfortably replied Downe complacently

That house Downe is none of my ordering Barnet broke out revealing
a bitterness hitherto suppressed and checking the horse a moment to
finish his speech before delivering up his passenger The house I have
already is good enough for me as you supposed It is my own freehold
it was built by my grandfather and is stout enough for a castle My
father was born there lived there and died there I was born there
and have always lived there yet I must needs build a new one

Why do you said Downe

Why do I To preserve peace in the household I do anything for that
but I dont succeed I was firm in resisting Chateau Ringdale
however not that I would not have put up with the absurdity of the name
but it was too much to have your house christened after Lord Ringdale
because your wife once had a fancy for him If you only knew everything
you would think all attempt at reconciliation hopeless In your happy
home you have had no such experiences and God forbid that you ever
should See here they are all ready to receive you

Of course And so will your wife be waiting to receive you said
Downe Take my word for it she will And with a dinner prepared for
you far better than mine

I hope so Barnet replied dubiously

He moved on to Downes door which the solicitors family had already
opened Downe descended but being encumbered with his bag and umbrella
his foot slipped and he fell upon his knees in the gutter

O my dear Charles said his wife running down the steps and quite
ignoring the presence of Barnet she seized hold of her husband pulled
him to his feet and kissed him exclaiming I hope you are not hurt
darling The children crowded round chiming in piteously Poor papa

Hes all right said Barnet perceiving that Downe was only a little
muddy and looking more at the wife than at the husband Almost at any
other timecertainly during his fastidious bachelor yearshe would have
thought her a too demonstrative woman but those recent circumstances of
his own life to which he had just alluded made Mrs Downes solicitude so
affecting that his eye grew damp as he witnessed it Bidding the lawyer
and his family goodnight he left them and drove slowly into the main
street towards his own house

The heart of Barnet was sufficiently impressionable to be influenced by
Downes parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome home as he
imagined the dreary night might at least on this one occasion make
Downes forecast true Hence it was in a suspense that he could hardly
have believed possible that he halted at his door On entering his wife
was nowhere to be seen and he inquired for her The servant informed
him that her mistress had the dressmaker with her and would be engaged
for some time

Dressmaker at this time of day

She dined early sir and hopes you will excuse her joining you this
evening

But she knew I was coming tonight

O yes sir

Go up and tell her I am come

The servant did so but the mistress of the house merely transmitted her
former words

Barnet said nothing more and presently sat down to his lonely meal
which was eaten abstractedly the domestic scene he had lately witnessed
still impressing him by its contrast with the situation here His mind
fell back into past years upon a certain pleasing and gentle being whose
face would loom out of their shades at such times as these Barnet
turned in his chair and looked with unfocused eyes in a direction
southward from where he sat as if he saw not the room but a long way
beyond I wonder if she lives there still he said



CHAPTER II


He rose with a sudden rebelliousness put on his hat and coat and went
out of the house pursuing his way along the glistening pavement while
eight oclock was striking from St Marys tower and the apprentices and
shopmen were slamming up the shutters from end to end of the town In
two minutes only those shops which could boast of no attendant save the
master or the mistress remained with open eyes These were ever somewhat
less prompt to exclude customers than the others for their owners ears
the closing hour had scarcely the cheerfulness that it possessed for the
hired servants of the rest Yet the night being dreary the delay was not
for long and their windows too blinked together one by one

During this time Barnet had proceeded with decided step in a direction at
right angles to the broad main thoroughfare of the town by a long street
leading due southward Here though his family had no more to do with
the flax manufacture his own name occasionally greeted him on gates and
warehouses being used allusively by small rising tradesmen as a
recommendation in such words as Smith from Barnet  CoRobinson
late manager at Barnets The sight led him to reflect upon his
fathers busy life and he questioned if it had not been far happier than
his own

The houses along the road became fewer and presently open ground
appeared between them on either side the track on the right hand rising
to a higher level till it merged in a knoll On the summit a row of
builders scaffoldpoles probed the indistinct sky like spears and at
their bases could be discerned the lower courses of a building lately
begun Barnet slackened his pace and stood for a few moments without
leaving the centre of the road apparently not much interested in the
sight till suddenly his eye was caught by a post in the fore part of the
ground bearing a white board at the top He went to the rails vaulted
over and walked in far enough to discern painted upon the board Chateau
Ringdale

A dismal irony seemed to lie in the words and its effect was to irritate
him Downe then had spoken truly He stuck his umbrella into the sod
and seized the post with both hands as if intending to loosen and throw
it down Then like one bewildered by an opposition which would exist
none the less though its manifestations were removed he allowed his arms
to sink to his side

Let it be he said to himself I have declared there shall be
peaceif possible

Taking up his umbrella he quietly left the enclosure and went on his
way still keeping his back to the town He had advanced with more
decision since passing the new building and soon a hoarse murmur rose
upon the gloom it was the sound of the sea The road led to the
harbour at a distance of a mile from the town from which the trade of
the district was fed After seeing the obnoxious nameboard Barnet had
forgotten to open his umbrella and the rain tapped smartly on his hat
and occasionally stroked his face as he went on

Though the lamps were still continued at the roadside they stood at
wider intervals than before and the pavement had given place to common
road Every time he came to a lamp an increasing shine made itself
visible upon his shoulders till at last they quite glistened with wet
The murmur from the shore grew stronger but it was still some distance
off when he paused before one of the smallest of the detached houses by
the wayside standing in its own garden the latter being divided from
the road by a row of wooden palings Scrutinizing the spot to ensure
that he was not mistaken he opened the gate and gently knocked at the
cottage door

When he had patiently waited minutes enough to lead any man in ordinary
cases to knock again the door was heard to open though it was
impossible to see by whose hand there being no light in the passage
Barnet said at random Does Miss Savile live here

A youthful voice assured him that she did live there and by a sudden
afterthought asked him to come in It would soon get a light it said
but the night being wet mother had not thought it worth while to trim
the passage lamp

Dont trouble yourself to get a light for me said Barnet hastily it
is not necessary at all Which is Miss Saviles sittingroom

The young person whose white pinafore could just be discerned signified
a door in the side of the passage and Barnet went forward at the same
moment so that no light should fall upon his face On entering the room
he closed the door behind him pausing till he heard the retreating
footsteps of the child

He found himself in an apartment which was simply and neatly though not
poorly furnished everything from the miniature chiffonnier to the
shining little daguerreotype which formed the central ornament of the
mantelpiece being in scrupulous order The picture was enclosed by a
frame of embroidered cardboardevidently the work of feminine handsand
it was the portrait of a thin faced elderly lieutenant in the navy From
behind the lamp on the table a female form now rose into view that of a
young girl and a resemblance between her and the portrait was early
discoverable She had been so absorbed in some occupation on the other
side of the lamp as to have barely found time to realize her visitors
presence

They both remained standing for a few seconds without speaking The face
that confronted Barnet had a beautiful outline the Raffaelesque oval of
its contour was remarkable for an English countenance and that
countenance housed in a remote countryroad to an unheardof harbour But
her features did not do justice to this splendid beginning Nature had
recollected that she was not in Italy and the young ladys lineaments
though not so inconsistent as to make her plain would have been accepted
rather as pleasing than as correct The preoccupied expression which
like images on the retina remained with her for a moment after the state
that caused it had ceased now changed into a reserved halfproud and
slightly indignant look in which the blood diffused itself quickly
across her cheek and additional brightness broke the shade of her rather
heavy eyes

I know I have no business here he said answering the look But I
had a great wish to see you and inquire how you were You can give your
hand to me seeing how often I have held it in past days

I would rather forget than remember all that Mr Barnet she answered
as she coldly complied with the request When I think of the
circumstances of our last meeting I can hardly consider it kind of you
to allude to such a thing as our pastor indeed to come here at all

There was no harm in it surely I dont trouble you often Lucy

I have not had the honour of a visit from you for a very long time
certainly and I did not expect it now she said with the same
stiffness in her air I hope Mrs Barnet is very well

Yes yes he impatiently returned At least I suppose sothough I
only speak from inference

But she is your wife sir said the young girl tremulously

The unwonted tones of a mans voice in that feminine chamber had startled
a canary that was roosting in its cage by the window the bird awoke
hastily and fluttered against the bars She went and stilled it by
laying her face against the cage and murmuring a coaxing sound It might
partly have been done to still herself

I didnt come to talk of Mrs Barnet he pursued I came to talk of
you of yourself alone to inquire how you are getting on since your
great loss And he turned towards the portrait of her father

I am getting on fairly well thank you

The force of her utterance was scarcely borne out by her look but Barnet
courteously reproached himself for not having guessed a thing so natural
and to dissipate all embarrassment added as he bent over the table
What were you doing when I camepainting flowers and by candlelight

O no she said not painting themonly sketching the outlines I do
that at night to save timeI have to get three dozen done by the end of
the month

Barnet looked as if he regretted it deeply You will wear your poor
eyes out he said with more sentiment than he had hitherto shown You
ought not to do it There was a time when I should have said you must
not WellI almost wish I had never seen light with my own eyes when I
think of that

Is this a time or place for recalling such matters she asked with
dignity You used to have a gentlemanly respect for me and for
yourself Dont speak any more as you have spoken and dont come again
I cannot think that this visit is serious or was closely considered by
you

Considered well I came to see you as an old and good friendnot to
mince matters to visit a woman I loved Dont be angry I could not
help doing it so many things brought you into my mind    This evening
I fell in with an acquaintance and when I saw how happy he was with his
wife and family welcoming him home though with only onetenth of my
income and chances and thought what might have been in my case it
fairly broke down my discretion and off I came here Now I am here I
feel that I am wrong to some extent But the feeling that I should like
to see you and talk of those we used to know in common was very
strong

Before that can be the case a little more time must pass said Miss
Savile quietly a time long enough for me to regard with some calmness
what at present I remember far too impatientlythough it may be you
almost forget it Indeed you must have forgotten it long before you
acted as you did Her voice grew stronger and more vivacious as she
added But I am doing my best to forget it too and I know I shall
succeed from the progress I have made already

She had remained standing till now when she turned and sat down facing
half away from him

Barnet watched her moodily Yes it is only what I deserve he said
Ambition pricked me onno it was not ambition it was wrongheadedness
Had I but reflected     He broke out vehemently But always
remember this Lucy if you had written to me only one little line after
that misunderstanding I declare I should have come back to you That
ruined me he slowly walked as far as the little room would allow him to
go and remained with his eyes on the skirting

But Mr Barnet how could I write to you There was no opening for my
doing so

Then there ought to have been said Barnet turning That was my
fault

Well I dont know anything about that but as there had been nothing
said by me which required any explanation by letter I did not send one
Everything was so indefinite and feeling your position to be so much
wealthier than mine I fancied I might have mistaken your meaning And
when I heard of the other ladya woman of whose family even you might be
proudI thought how foolish I had been and said nothing

Then I suppose it was destinyaccidentI dont know what that
separated us dear Lucy Anyhow you were the woman I ought to have made
my wifeand I let you slip like the foolish man that I was

O Mr Barnet she said almost in tears dont revive the subject to
me I am the wrong one to console youthink siryou should not be
hereit would be so bad for me if it were known

It wouldit would indeed he said hastily I am not right in doing
this and I wont do it again

It is a very common folly of human nature you know to think the course
you did not adopt must have been the best she continued with gentle
solicitude as she followed him to the door of the room And you dont
know that I should have accepted you even if you had asked me to be your
wife At this his eye met hers and she dropped her gaze She knew
that her voice belied her There was a silence till she looked up to
add in a voice of soothing playfulness My family was so much poorer
than yours even before I lost my dear father thatperhaps your
companions would have made it unpleasant for us on account of my
deficiencies

Your disposition would soon have won them round said Barnet

She archly expostulated Now never mind my disposition try to make it
up with your wife Those are my commands to you And now you are to
leave me at once

I will I must make the best of it all I suppose he replied more
cheerfully than he had as yet spoken But I shall never again meet with
such a dear girl as you And he suddenly opened the door and left her
alone When his glance again fell on the lamps that were sparsely ranged
along the dreary level road his eyes were in a state which showed straw
like motes of light radiating from each flame into the surrounding air

On the other side of the way Barnet observed a man under an umbrella
walking parallel with himself Presently this man left the footway and
gradually converged on Barnets course The latter then saw that it was
Charlson a surgeon of the town who owed him money Charlson was a man
not without ability yet he did not prosper Sundry circumstances stood
in his way as a medical practitioner he was needy he was not a coddle
he gossiped with men instead of with women he had married a stranger
instead of one of the town young ladies and he was given to
conversational buffoonery Moreover his look was quite erroneous Those
only proper features in the family doctor the quiet eye and the thin
straight passionless lips which never curl in public either for laughter
or for scorn were not his he had a fullcurved mouth and a bold black
eye that made timid people nervous His companions were what in old
times would have been called boon companionsan expression which though
of irreproachable root suggests fraternization carried to the point of
unscrupulousness All this was against him in the little town of his
adoption

Charlson had been in difficulties and to oblige him Barnet had put his
name to a bill and as he had expected was called upon to meet it when
it fell due It had been only a matter of fifty pounds which Barnet
could well afford to lose and he bore no illwill to the thriftless
surgeon on account of it But Charlson had a little too much brazen
indifferentism in his composition to be altogether a desirable
acquaintance

I hope to be able to make that little billbusiness right with you in
the course of three weeks Mr Barnet said Charlson with hailfellow
friendliness

Barnet replied goodnaturedly that there was no hurry

This particular three weeks had moved on in advance of Charlsons present
with the precision of a shadow for some considerable time

Ive had a dream Charlson continued Barnet knew from his tone that
the surgeon was going to begin his characteristic nonsense and did not
encourage him Ive had a dream repeated Charlson who required no
encouragement I dreamed that a gentleman who has been very kind to
me married a haughty lady in haste before he had quite forgotten a nice
little girl he knew before and that one wet evening like the present
as I was walking up the harbourroad I saw him come out of that dear
little girls present abode

Barnet glanced towards the speaker The rays from a neighbouring lamp
struck through the drizzle under Charlsons umbrella so as just to
illumine his face against the shade behind and show that his eye was
turned up under the outer corner of its lid whence it leered with impish
jocoseness as he thrust his tongue into his cheek

Come said Barnet gravely well have no more of that

No noof course not Charlson hastily answered seeing that his
humour had carried him too far as it had done many times before He was
profuse in his apologies but Barnet did not reply Of one thing he was
certainthat scandal was a plant of quick root and that he was bound to
obey Lucys injunction for Lucys own sake



CHAPTER III


He did so to the letter and though as the crocus followed the snowdrop
and the daffodil the crocus in Lucys garden the harbourroad was a not
unpleasant place to walk in Barnets feet never trod its stones much
less approached her door He avoided a saunter that way as he would have
avoided a dangerous dram and took his airings a long distance northward
among severely square and brown ploughed fields where no other townsman
came Sometimes he went round by the lower lanes of the borough where
the ropewalks stretched in which his family formerly had share and
looked at the ropemakers walking backwards overhung by appletrees and
bushes and intruded on by cows and calves as if trade had established
itself there at considerable inconvenience to Nature

One morning when the sun was so warm as to raise a steam from the south
eastern slopes of those flanking hills that looked so lovely above the
old roofs but made every lowchimneyed house in the town as smoky as
Tophet Barnet glanced from the windows of the towncouncil room for lack
of interest in what was proceeding within Several members of the
corporation were present but there was not much business doing and in a
few minutes Downe came leisurely across to him saying that he seldom saw
Barnet now

Barnet owned that he was not often present

Downe looked at the crimson curtain which hung down beside the panes
reflecting its hot hues into their faces and then out of the window At
that moment there passed along the street a tall commanding lady in whom
the solicitor recognized Barnets wife Barnet had done the same thing
and turned away

It will be all right some day said Downe with cheering sympathy

You have heard then of her last outbreak

Downe depressed his cheerfulness to its very reverse in a moment No I
have not heard of anything serious he said with as long a face as one
naturally round could be turned into at short notice I only hear vague
reports of such things

You may think it will be all right said Barnet drily But I have a
different opinion    No Downe we must look the thing in the face
Not poppy nor mandragorahowever how are your wife and children

Downe said that they were all well thanks they were out that morning
somewhere he was just looking to see if they were walking that way Ah
there they were just coming down the street and Downe pointed to the
figures of two children with a nursemaid and a lady walking behind them

You will come out and speak to her he asked

Not this morning The fact is I dont care to speak to anybody just
now

You are too sensitive Mr Barnet At school I remember you used to get
as red as a rose if anybody uttered a word that hurt your feelings

Barnet mused Yes he admitted there is a grain of truth in that It
is because of that I often try to make peace at home Life would be
tolerable then at any rate even if not particularly bright

I have thought more than once of proposing a little plan to you said
Downe with some hesitation I dont know whether it will meet your
views but take it or leave it as you choose In fact it was my wife
who suggested it that she would be very glad to call on Mrs Barnet and
get into her confidence She seems to think that Mrs Barnet is rather
alone in the town and without advisers Her impression is that your
wife will listen to reason Emily has a wonderful way of winning the
hearts of people of her own sex

And of the other sex too I think She is a charming woman and you
were a lucky fellow to find her

Well perhaps I was simpered Downe trying to wear an aspect of being
the last man in the world to feel pride However she will be likely to
find out what ruffles Mrs Barnet Perhaps it is some misunderstanding
you knowsomething that she is too proud to ask you to explain or some
little thing in your conduct that irritates her because she does not
fully comprehend you The truth is Emily would have been more ready to
make advances if she had been quite sure of her fitness for Mrs Barnets
society who has of course been accustomed to London people of good
position which made Emily fearful of intruding

Barnet expressed his warmest thanks for the wellintentioned proposition
There was reason in Mrs Downes fearthat he owned But do let her
call he said There is no woman in England I would so soon trust on
such an errand I am afraid there will not be any brilliant result
still I shall take it as the kindest and nicest thing if she will try it
and not be frightened at a repulse

When Barnet and Downe had parted the former went to the Town Savings
Bank of which he was a trustee and endeavoured to forget his troubles
in the contemplation of low sums of money and figures in a network of
red and blue lines He sat and watched the workingpeople making their
deposits to which at intervals he signed his name Before he left in
the afternoon Downe put his head inside the door

Emily has seen Mrs Barnet he said in a low voice She has got Mrs
Barnets promise to take her for a drive down to the shore tomorrow if
it is fine Good afternoon

Barnet shook Downe by the hand without speaking and Downe went away



CHAPTER IV


The next day was as fine as the arrangement could possibly require As
the sun passed the meridian and declined westward the tall shadows from
the scaffoldpoles of Barnets rising residence streaked the ground as
far as to the middle of the highway Barnet himself was there inspecting
the progress of the works for the first time during several weeks A
building in an oldfashioned town fiveandthirty years ago did not as
in the modern fashion rise from the sod like a booth at a fair The
foundations and lower courses were put in and allowed to settle for many
weeks before the superstructure was built up and a whole summer of
drying was hardly sufficient to do justice to the important issues
involved Barnet stood within a windowniche which had as yet received
no frame and thence looked down a slope into the road The wheels of a
chaise were heard and then his handsome Xantippe in the company of Mrs
Downe drove past on their way to the shore They were driving slowly
there was a pleasing light in Mrs Downes face which seemed faintly to
reflect itself upon the countenance of her companionthat politesse du
coeur which was so natural to her having possibly begun already to work
results But whatever the situation Barnet resolved not to interfere
or do anything to hazard the promise of the day He might well afford to
trust the issue to another when he could never direct it but to ill
himself His wifes clenched reinhand in its lemoncoloured glove her
stiff erect figure clad in velvet and lace and her boldlyoutlined
face passed on exhibiting their owner as one fixed for ever above the
level of her companionsocially by her early breeding and materially by
her higher cushion

Barnet decided to allow them a proper time to themselves and then stroll
down to the shore and drive them home After lingering on at the house
for another hour he started with this intention A few hundred yards
below Chateau Ringdale stood the cottage in which the late lieutenants
daughter had her lodging Barnet had not been so far that way for a long
time and as he approached the forbidden ground a curious warmth passed
into him which led him to perceive that unless he were careful he
might have to fight the battle with himself about Lucy over again A
tenth of his present excuse would however have justified him in
travelling by that road today

He came opposite the dwelling and turned his eyes for a momentary glance
into the little garden that stretched from the palings to the door Lucy
was in the enclosure she was walking and stooping to gather some
flowers possibly for the purpose of painting them for she moved about
quickly as if anxious to save time She did not see him he might have
passed unnoticed but a sensation which was not in strict unison with his
previous sentiments that day led him to pause in his walk and watch her
She went nimbly round and round the beds of anemones tulips jonquils
polyanthuses and other oldfashioned flowers looking a very charming
figure in her halfmourning bonnet and with an incomplete nosegay in her
left hand Raising herself to pull down a lilac blossom she observed
him

Mr Barnet she said innocently smiling Why I have been thinking
of you many times since Mrs Barnet went by in the ponycarriage and now
here you are

Yes Lucy he said

Then she seemed to recall particulars of their last meeting and he
believed that she flushed though it might have been only the fancy of
his own supersensitivenesss

I am going to the harbour he added

Are you Lucy remarked simply A great many people begin to go there
now the summer is drawing on

Her face had come more into his view as she spoke and he noticed how
much thinner and paler it was than when he had seen it last Lucy how
weary you look tell me can I help you he was going to cry outIf I
do he thought it will be the ruin of us both He merely said that
the afternoon was fine and went on his way

As he went a sudden blast of air came over the hill as if in
contradiction to his words and spoilt the previous quiet of the scene
The wind had already shifted violently and now smelt of the sea

The harbourroad soon began to justify its name A gap appeared in the
rampart of hills which shut out the sea and on the left of the opening
rose a vertical cliff coloured a burning orange by the sunlight the
companion cliff on the right being livid in shade Between these cliffs
like the Libyan bay which sheltered the shipwrecked Trojans was a little
haven seemingly a beginning made by Nature herself of a perfect harbour
which appealed to the passerby as only requiring a little human industry
to finish it and make it famous the ground on each side as far back as
the daisied slopes that bounded the interior valley being a mere layer of
blown sand But the PortBredy burgesses a mile inland had in the
course of ten centuries responded many times to that mute appeal with
the result that the tides had invariably choked up their works with sand
and shingle as soon as completed There were but few houses here a
rough pier a few boats some stores an inn a residence or two a ketch
unloading in the harbour were the chief features of the settlement On
the open ground by the shore stood his wifes ponycarriage empty the
boy in attendance holding the horse

When Barnet drew nearer he saw an indigocoloured spot moving swiftly
along beneath the radiant base of the eastern cliff which proved to be a
man in a jersey running with all his might He held up his hand to
Barnet as it seemed and they approached each other The man was local
but a stranger to him

What is it my man said Barnet

A terrible calamity the boatman hastily explained Two ladies had
been capsized in a boatthey were Mrs Downe and Mrs Barnet of the old
town they had driven down there that afternoonthey had alighted and
it was so fine that after walking about a little while they had been
tempted to go out for a short sail round the cliff Just as they were
putting in to the shore the wind shifted with a sudden gust the boat
listed over and it was thought they were both drowned How it could
have happened was beyond his mind to fathom for John Green knew how to
sail a boat as well as any man there

Which is the way to the place said Barnet

It was just round the cliff

Run to the carriage and tell the boy to bring it to the place as soon as
you can Then go to the Harbour Inn and tell them to ride to town for a
doctor Have they been got out of the water

One lady has

Which

Mrs Barnet Mrs Downe it is feared has fleeted out to sea

Barnet ran on to that part of the shore which the cliff had hitherto
obscured from his view and there discerned a long way ahead a group of
fishermen standing As soon as he came up one or two recognized him
and not liking to meet his eye turned aside with misgiving He went
amidst them and saw a small sailingboat lying draggled at the waters
edge and on the sloping shingle beside it a soaked and sandy womans
form in the velvet dress and yellow gloves of his wife



CHAPTER V


All had been done that could be done Mrs Barnet was in her own house
under medical hands but the result was still uncertain Barnet had
acted as if devotion to his wife were the dominant passion of his
existence There had been much to decidewhether to attempt restoration
of the apparently lifeless body as it lay on the shorewhether to carry
her to the Harbour Innwhether to drive with her at once to his own
house The first course with no skilled help or appliances near at
hand had seemed hopeless The second course would have occupied nearly
as much time as a drive to the town owing to the intervening ridges of
shingle and the necessity of crossing the harbour by boat to get to the
house added to which much time must have elapsed before a doctor could
have arrived down there By bringing her home in the carriage some
precious moments had slipped by but she had been laid in her own bed in
seven minutes a doctor called to her side and every possible
restorative brought to bear upon her

At what a tearing pace he had driven up that road through the yellow
evening sunlight the shadows flapping irksomely into his eyes as each
wayside object rushed past between him and the west Tired workmen with
their baskets at their backs had turned on their homeward journey to
wonder at his speed Halfway between the shore and PortBredy town he
had met Charlson who had been the first surgeon to hear of the accident
He was accompanied by his assistant in a gig Barnet had sent on the
latter to the coast in case that Downes poor wife should by that time
have been reclaimed from the waves and had brought Charlson back with
him to the house

Barnets presence was not needed here and he felt it to be his next duty
to set off at once and find Downe that no other than himself might break
the news to him

He was quite sure that no chance had been lost for Mrs Downe by his
leaving the shore By the time that Mrs Barnet had been laid in the
carriage a much larger group had assembled to lend assistance in finding
her friend rendering his own help superfluous But the duty of breaking
the news was made doubly painful by the circumstance that the catastrophe
which had befallen Mrs Downe was solely the result of her own and her
husbands lovingkindness towards himself

He found Downe in his office When the solicitor comprehended the
intelligence he turned pale stood up and remained for a moment
perfectly still as if bereft of his faculties then his shoulders
heaved he pulled out his handkerchief and began to cry like a child His
sobs might have been heard in the next room He seemed to have no idea
of going to the shore or of doing anything but when Barnet took him
gently by the hand and proposed to start at once he quietly acquiesced
neither uttering any further word nor making any effort to repress his
tears

Barnet accompanied him to the shore where finding that no trace had as
yet been seen of Mrs Downe and that his stay would be of no avail he
left Downe with his friends and the young doctor and once more hastened
back to his own house

At the door he met Charlson Well Barnet said

I have just come down said the doctor we have done everything but
without result I sympathize with you in your bereavement

Barnet did not much appreciate Charlsons sympathy which sounded to his
ears as something of a mockery from the lips of a man who knew what
Charlson knew about their domestic relations Indeed there seemed an odd
spark in Charlsons full black eye as he said the words but that might
have been imaginary

And Mr Barnet Charlson resumed that little matter between usI
hope to settle it finally in three weeks at least

Never mind that now said Barnet abruptly He directed the surgeon to
go to the harbour in case his services might even now be necessary there
and himself entered the house

The servants were coming from his wifes chamber looking helplessly at
each other and at him He passed them by and entered the room where he
stood mutely regarding the bed for a few minutes after which he walked
into his own dressingroom adjoining and there paced up and down In a
minute or two he noticed what a strange and total silence had come over
the upper part of the house his own movements muffled as they were by
the carpet seemed noisy and his thoughts to disturb the air like
articulate utterances His eye glanced through the window Far down the
road to the harbour a roof detained his gaze out of it rose a red
chimney and out of the red chimney a curl of smoke as from a fire newly
kindled He had often seen such a sight before In that house lived
Lucy Savile and the smoke was from the fire which was regularly lighted
at this time to make her tea

After that he went back to the bedroom and stood there some time
regarding his wifes silent form She was a woman some years older than
himself but had not by any means overpassed the maturity of good looks
and vigour Her passionate features welldefined firm and statuesque
in life were doubly so now her mouth and brow beneath her purplish
black hair showed only too clearly that the turbulency of character
which had made a beargarden of his house had been no temporary phase of
her existence While he reflected he suddenly said to himself I wonder
if all has been done

The thought was led up to by his having fancied that his wifes features
lacked in its complete form the expression which he had been accustomed
to associate with the faces of those whose spirits have fled for ever
The effacement of life was not so marked but that entering uninformed
he might have supposed her sleeping Her complexion was that seen in the
numerous faded portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds it was pallid in
comparison with life but there was visible on a close inspection the
remnant of what had once been a flush the keeping between the cheeks and
the hollows of the face being thus preserved although positive colour
was gone Long orange rays of evening sun stole in through chinks in the
blind striking on the large mirror and being thence reflected upon the
crimson hangings and woodwork of the heavy bedstead so that the general
tone of light was remarkably warm and it was probable that something
might be due to this circumstance Still the fact impressed him as
strange Charlson had been gone more than a quarter of an hour could it
be possible that he had left too soon and that his attempts to restore
her had operated so sluggishly as only now to have made themselves felt
Barnet laid his hand upon her chest and fancied that ever and anon a
faint flutter of palpitation gentle as that of a butterflys wing
disturbed the stillness thereceasing for a time then struggling to go
on then breaking down in weakness and ceasing again

Barnets mother had been an active practitioner of the healing art among
her poorer neighbours and her inspirations had all been derived from an
octavo volume of Domestic Medicine which at this moment was lying as it
had lain for many years on a shelf in Barnets dressingroom He
hastily fetched it and there read under the head Drowning

 Exertions for the recovery of any person who has not been immersed
 for a longer period than halfanhour should be continued for at least
 four hours as there have been many cases in which returning life has
 made itself visible even after a longer interval

 Should however a weak action of any of the organs show itself when
 the case seems almost hopeless our efforts must be redoubled the
 feeble spark in this case requires to be solicited it will certainly
 disappear under a relaxation of labour

Barnet looked at his watch it was now barely two hours and a half from
the time when he had first heard of the accident He threw aside the
book and turned quickly to reach a stimulant which had previously been
used Pulling up the blind for more light his eye glanced out of the
window There he saw that red chimney still smoking cheerily and that
roof and through the roof that somebody His mechanical movements
stopped his hand remained on the blindcord and he seemed to become
breathless as if he had suddenly found himself treading a high rope

While he stood a sparrow lighted on the windowsill saw him and flew
away Next a man and a dog walked over one of the green hills which
bulged above the roofs of the town But Barnet took no notice

We may wonder what were the exact images that passed through his mind
during those minutes of gazing upon Lucy Saviles house the sparrow the
man and the dog and Lucy Saviles house again There are honest men who
will not admit to their thoughts even as idle hypotheses views of the
future that assume as done a deed which they would recoil from doing and
there are other honest men for whom morality ends at the surface of their
own heads who will deliberate what the first will not so much as
suppose Barnet had a wife whose pretence distracted his home she now
lay as in death by merely doing nothingby letting the intelligence
which had gone forth to the world lie undisturbedhe would effect such a
deliverance for himself as he had never hoped for and open up an
opportunity of which till now he had never dreamed Whether the
conjuncture had arisen through any unscrupulous illconsidered impulse
of Charlson to help out of a strait the friend who was so kind as never
to press him for what was due could not be told there was nothing to
prove it and it was a question which could never be asked The
triangular situationhimselfhis wifeLucy Savilewas the one clear
thing

From Barnets actions we may infer that he supposed such and such a
result for a moment but did not deliberate He withdrew his hazel eyes
from the scene without calmly turned rang the bell for assistance and
vigorously exerted himself to learn if life still lingered in that
motionless frame In a short time another surgeon was in attendance and
then Barnets surmise proved to be true The slow life timidly heaved
again but much care and patience were needed to catch and retain it and
a considerable period elapsed before it could be said with certainty that
Mrs Barnet lived When this was the case and there was no further room
for doubt Barnet left the chamber The blue evening smoke from Lucys
chimney had died down to an imperceptible stream and as he walked about
downstairs he murmured to himself My wife was dead and she is alive
again

It was not so with Downe After three hours immersion his wifes body
had been recovered life of course being quite extinct Barnet on
descending went straight to his friends house and there learned the
result Downe was helpless in his wild grief occasionally even
hysterical Barnet said little but finding that some guiding hand was
necessary in the sorrowstricken household took upon him to supervise
and manage till Downe should be in a state of mind to do so for himself



CHAPTER VI


One September evening four months later when Mrs Barnet was in perfect
health and Mrs Downe but a weakening memory an errandboy paused to
rest himself in front of Mr Barnets old house depositing his basket on
one of the windowsills The street was not yet lighted but there were
lights in the house and at intervals a flitting shadow fell upon the
blind at his elbow Words also were audible from the same apartment and
they seemed to be those of persons in violent altercation But the boy
could not gather their purport and he went on his way

Ten minutes afterwards the door of Barnets house opened and a tall
closelyveiled lady in a travellingdress came out and descended the
freestone steps The servant stood in the doorway watching her as she
went with a measured tread down the street When she had been out of
sight for some minutes Barnet appeared at the door from within

Did your mistress leave word where she was going he asked

No sir

Is the carriage ordered to meet her anywhere

No sir

Did she take a latchkey

No sir

Barnet went in again sat down in his chair and leaned back Then in
solitude and silence he brooded over the bitter emotions that filled his
heart It was for this that he had gratuitously restored her to life
and made his union with another impossible The evening drew on and
nobody came to disturb him At bedtime he told the servants to retire
that he would sit up for Mrs Barnet himself and when they were gone he
leaned his head upon his hand and mused for hours

The clock struck one two still his wife came not and with impatience
added to depression he went from room to room till another weary hour
had passed This was not altogether a new experience for Barnet but she
had never before so prolonged her absence At last he sat down again and
fell asleep

He awoke at six oclock to find that she had not returned In searching
about the rooms he discovered that she had taken a case of jewels which
had been hers before her marriage At eight a note was brought him it
was from his wife in which she stated that she had gone by the coach to
the house of a distant relative near London and expressed a wish that
certain boxes articles of clothing and so on might be sent to her
forthwith The note was brought to him by a waiter at the BlackBull
Hotel and had been written by Mrs Barnet immediately before she took
her place in the stage

By the evening this order was carried out and Barnet with a sense of
relief walked out into the town A fair had been held during the day
and the large clear moon which rose over the most prominent hill flung
its light upon the booths and standings that still remained in the
street mixing its rays curiously with those from the flaring naphtha
lamps The town was full of countrypeople who had come in to enjoy
themselves and on this account Barnet strolled through the streets
unobserved With a certain recklessness he made for the harbourroad
and presently found himself by the shore where he walked on till he came
to the spot near which his friend the kindly Mrs Downe had lost her
life and his own wifes life had been preserved A tremulous pathway of
bright moonshine now stretched over the water which had engulfed them
and not a living soul was near

Here he ruminated on their characters and next on the young girl in whom
he now took a more sensitive interest than at the time when he had been
free to marry her Nothing so far as he was aware had ever appeared in
his own conduct to show that such an interest existed He had made it a
point of the utmost strictness to hinder that feeling from influencing in
the faintest degree his attitude towards his wife and this was made all
the more easy for him by the small demand Mrs Barnet made upon his
attentions for which she ever evinced the greatest contempt thus
unwittingly giving him the satisfaction of knowing that their severance
owed nothing to jealousy or indeed to any personal behaviour of his at
all Her concern was not with him or his feelings as she frequently
told him but that she had in a moment of weakness thrown herself away
upon a common burgher when she might have aimed at and possibly brought
down a peer of the realm Her frequent depreciation of Barnet in these
terms had at times been so intense that he was sorely tempted to
retaliate on her egotism by owning that he loved at the same low level on
which he lived but prudence had prevailed for which he was now
thankful

Something seemed to sound upon the shingle behind him over and above the
raking of the wave He looked round and a slight girlish shape appeared
quite close to him He could not see her face because it was in the
direction of the moon

Mr Barnet the rambler said in timid surprise The voice was the
voice of Lucy Savile

Yes said Barnet How can I repay you for this pleasure

I only came because the night was so clear I am now on my way home

I am glad we have met I want to know if you will let me do something
for you to give me an occupation as an idle man I am sure I ought to
help you for I know you are almost without friends

She hesitated Why should you tell me that she said

In the hope that you will be frank with me

I am not altogether without friends here But I am going to make a
little change in my lifeto go out as a teacher of freehand drawing and
practical perspective of course I mean on a comparatively humble scale
because I have not been specially educated for that profession But I am
sure I shall like it much

You have an opening

I have not exactly got it but I have advertised for one

Lucy you must let me help you

Not at all

You need not think it would compromise you or that I am indifferent to
delicacy I bear in mind how we stand It is very unlikely that you
will succeed as teacher of the class you mention so let me do something
of a different kind for you Say what you would like and it shall be
done

No if I cant be a drawingmistress or governess or something of that
sort I shall go to India and join my brother

I wish I could go abroad anywhere everywhere with you Lucy and leave
this place and its associations for ever

She played with the end of her bonnetstring and hastily turned aside
Dont ever touch upon that kind of topic again she said with a quick
severity not free from anger It simply makes it impossible for me to
see you much less receive any guidance from you No thank you Mr
Barnet you can do nothing for me at present and as I suppose my
uncertainty will end in my leaving for India I fear you never will If
ever I think you can do anything I will take the trouble to ask you
Till then goodbye

The tone of her latter words was equivocal and while he remained in
doubt whether a gentle irony was or was not inwrought with their sound
she swept lightly round and left him alone He saw her form get smaller
and smaller along the damp belt of seasand between ebb and flood and
when she had vanished round the cliff into the harbourroad he himself
followed in the same direction

That her hopes from an advertisement should be the single thread which
held Lucy Savile in England was too much for Barnet On reaching the
town he went straight to the residence of Downe now a widower with four
children The young motherless brood had been sent to bed about a
quarter of an hour earlier and when Barnet entered he found Downe
sitting alone It was the same room as that from which the family had
been looking out for Downe at the beginning of the year when Downe had
slipped into the gutter and his wife had been so enviably tender towards
him The old neatness had gone from the house articles lay in places
which could show no reason for their presence as if momentarily
deposited there some months ago and forgotten ever since there were no
flowers things were jumbled together on the furniture which should have
been in cupboards and the place in general had that stagnant
unrenovated air which usually pervades the maimed home of the widower

Downe soon renewed his customary fullworded lament over his wife and
even when he had worked himself up to tears went on volubly as if a
listener were a luxury to be enjoyed whenever he could be caught

She was a treasure beyond compare Mr Barnet I shall never see such
another Nobody now to nurse menobody to console me in those daily
troubles you know Barnet which make consolation so necessary to a
nature like mine It would be unbecoming to repine for her spirits
home was elsewherethe tender light in her eyes always showed it but it
is a long dreary time that I have before me and nobody else can ever
fill the void left in my heart by her lossnobodynobody And Downe
wiped his eyes again

She was a good woman in the highest sense gravely answered Barnet
who though Downes words drew genuine compassion from his heart could
not help feeling that a tender reticence would have been a finer tribute
to Mrs Downes really sterling virtues than such a secondclass lament
as this

I have something to show you Downe resumed producing from a drawer a
sheet of paper on which was an elaborate design for a canopied tomb
This has been sent me by the architect but it is not exactly what I
want

You have got Jones to do it I see the man who is carrying out my
house said Barnet as he glanced at the signature to the drawing

Yes but it is not quite what I want I want something more
strikingmore like a tomb I have seen in St Pauls Cathedral Nothing
less will do justice to my feelings and how far short of them that will
fall

Barnet privately thought the design a sufficiently imposing one as it
stood even extravagantly ornate but feeling that he had no right to
criticize he said gently Downe should you not live more in your
childrens lives at the present time and soften the sharpness of regret
for your own past by thinking of their future

Yes yes but what can I do more asked Downe wrinkling his forehead
hopelessly

It was with anxious slowness that Barnet produced his replythe secret
object of his visit tonight Did you not say one day that you ought by
rights to get a governess for the children

Downe admitted that he had said so but that he could not see his way to
it The kind of woman I should like to have he said would be rather
beyond my means No I think I shall send them to school in the town
when they are old enough to go out alone

Now I know of something better than that The late Lieutenant Saviles
daughter Lucy wants to do something for herself in the way of teaching
She would be inexpensive and would answer your purpose as well as
anybody for six or twelve months She would probably come daily if you
were to ask her and so your housekeeping arrangements would not be much
affected

I thought she had gone away said the solicitor musing Where does
she live

Barnet told him and added that if Downe should think of her as
suitable he would do well to call as soon as possible or she might be
on the wing If you do see her he said it would be advisable not to
mention my name She is rather stiff in her ideas of me and it might
prejudice her against a course if she knew that I recommended it

Downe promised to give the subject his consideration and nothing more
was said about it just then But when Barnet rose to go which was not
till nearly bedtime he reminded Downe of the suggestion and went up the
street to his own solitary home with a sense of satisfaction at his
promising diplomacy in a charitable cause



CHAPTER VII


The walls of his new house were carried up nearly to their full height
By a curious though not infrequent reaction Barnets feelings about that
unnecessary structure had undergone a change he took considerable
interest in its progress as a longneglected thing his wife before her
departure having grown quite weary of it as a hobby Moreover it was an
excellent distraction for a man in the unhappy position of having to live
in a provincial town with nothing to do He was probably the first of
his line who had ever passed a day without toil and perhaps something
like an inherited instinct disqualifies such men for a life of pleasant
inaction such as lies in the power of those whose leisure is not a
personal accident but a vast historical accretion which has become part
of their natures

Thus Barnet got into a way of spending many of his leisure hours on the
site of the new building and he might have been seen on most days at
this time trying the temper of the mortar by punching the joints with his
stick looking at the grain of a floorboard and meditating where it
grew or picturing under what circumstances the last fire would be
kindled in the at present sootless chimneys One day when thus occupied
he saw three children pass by in the company of a fair young woman whose
sudden appearance caused him to flush perceptibly

Ah she is there he thought Thats a blessed thing

Casting an interested glance over the rising building and the busy
workmen Lucy Savile and the little Downes passed by and after that time
it became a regular though almost unconscious custom of Barnet to stand
in the halfcompleted house and look from the ungarnished windows at the
governess as she tripped towards the seashore with her young charges
which she was in the habit of doing on most fine afternoons It was on
one of these occasions when he had been loitering on the firstfloor
landing near the hole left for the staircase not yet erected that
there appeared above the edge of the floor a little hat followed by a
little head

Barnet withdrew through a doorway and the child came to the top of the
ladder stepping on to the floor and crying to her sisters and Miss
Savile to follow Another head rose above the floor and another and
then Lucy herself came into view The troop ran hither and thither
through the empty shavingstrewn rooms and Barnet came forward

Lucy uttered a small exclamation she was very sorry that she had
intruded she had not the least idea that Mr Barnet was there the
children had come up and she had followed

Barnet replied that he was only too glad to see them there And now
let me show you the rooms he said

She passively assented and he took her round There was not much to
show in such a bare skeleton of a house but he made the most of it and
explained the different ornamental fittings that were soon to be fixed
here and there Lucy made but few remarks in reply though she seemed
pleased with her visit and stole away down the ladder followed by her
companions

After this the new residence became yet more of a hobby for Barnet
Downes children did not forget their first visit and when the windows
were glazed and the handsome staircase spread its broad low steps into
the hall they came again prancing in unwearied succession through every
room from groundfloor to attics while Lucy stood waiting for them at
the door Barnet who rarely missed a day in coming to inspect progress
stepped out from the drawingroom

I could not keep them out she said with an apologetic blush I
tried to do so very much but they are rather wilful and we are directed
to walk this way for the sea air

Do let them make the house their regular playground and you yours
said Barnet There is no better place for children to romp and take
their exercise in than an empty house particularly in muddy or damp
weather such as we shall get a good deal of now and this place will not
be furnished for a long long timeperhaps never I am not at all
decided about it

O but it must replied Lucy looking round at the hall The rooms
are excellent twice as high as ours and the views from the windows are
so lovely

I daresay I daresay he said absently

Will all the furniture be new she asked

All the furniture be newthats a thing I have not thought of In fact
I only come here and look on My fathers house would have been large
enough for me but another person had a voice in the matter and it was
settled that we should build However the place grows upon me its
recent associations are cheerful and I am getting to like it fast

A certain uneasiness in Lucys manner showed that the conversation was
taking too personal a turn for her Still as modern tastes develop
people require more room to gratify them in she said withdrawing to
call the children and serenely bidding him good afternoon she went on
her way

Barnets life at this period was singularly lonely and yet he was
happier than he could have expected His wifes estrangement and
absence which promised to be permanent left him free as a boy in his
movements and the solitary walks that he took gave him ample opportunity
for chastened reflection on what might have been his lot if he had only
shown wisdom enough to claim Lucy Savile when there was no bar between
their lives and she was to be had for the asking He would occasionally
call at the house of his friend Downe but there was scarcely enough in
common between their two natures to make them more than friends of that
excellent sort whose personal knowledge of each others history and
character is always in excess of intimacy whereby they are not so likely
to be severed by a clash of sentiment as in cases where intimacy springs
up in excess of knowledge Lucy was never visible at these times being
either engaged in the schoolroom or in taking an airing out of doors
but knowing that she was now comfortable and had given up the to him
depressing idea of going off to the other side of the globe he was quite
content

The new house had so far progressed that the gardeners were beginning to
grass down the front During an afternoon which he was passing in
marking the curve for the carriagedrive he beheld her coming in boldly
towards him from the road Hitherto Barnet had only caught her on the
premises by stealth and this advance seemed to show that at last her
reserve had broken down

A smile gained strength upon her face as she approached and it was quite
radiant when she came up and said without a trace of embarrassment I
find I owe you a hundred thanksand it comes to me quite as a surprise
It was through your kindness that I was engaged by Mr Downe Believe
me Mr Barnet I did not know it until yesterday or I should have
thanked you long and long ago

I had offended youjust a trifleat the time I think said Barnet
smiling and it was best that you should not know

Yes yes she returned hastily Dont allude to that it is past and
over and we will let it be The house is finished almost is it not
How beautiful it will look when the evergreens are grown Do you call
the style Palladian Mr Barnet

Ireally dont quite know what it is Yes it must be Palladian
certainly But Ill ask Jones the architect for to tell the truth I
had not thought much about the style I had nothing to do with choosing
it I am sorry to say

She would not let him harp on this gloomy refrain and talked on bright
matters till she said producing a small roll of paper which he had
noticed in her hand all the while Mr Downe wished me to bring you this
revised drawing of the late Mrs Downes tomb which the architect has
just sent him He would like you to look it over

The children came up with their hoops and she went off with them down
the harbourroad as usual Barnet had been glad to get those words of
thanks he had been thinking for many months that he would like her to
know of his share in finding her a home such as it was and what he could
not do for himself Downe had now kindly done for him He returned to
his desolate house with a lighter tread though in reason he hardly knew
why his tread should be light

On examining the drawing Barnet found that instead of the vast altar
tomb and canopy Downe had determined on at their last meeting it was to
be a more modest memorial even than had been suggested by the architect
a coped tomb of good solid construction with no useless elaboration at
all Barnet was truly glad to see that Downe had come to reason of his
own accord and he returned the drawing with a note of approval

He followed up the housework as before and as he walked up and down the
rooms occasionally gazing from the windows over the bulging green hills
and the quiet harbour that lay between them he murmured words and
fragments of words which if listened to would have revealed all the
secrets of his existence Whatever his reason in going there Lucy did
not call again the walk to the shore seemed to be abandoned he must
have thought it as well for both that it should be so for he did not go
anywhere out of his accustomed ways to endeavour to discover her



CHAPTER VIII


The winter and the spring had passed and the house was complete It was
a fine morning in the early part of June and Barnet though not in the
habit of rising early had taken a long walk before breakfast returning
by way of the new building A sufficiently exciting cause of his
restlessness today might have been the intelligence which had reached
him the night before that Lucy Savile was going to India after all and
notwithstanding the representations of her friends that such a journey
was unadvisable in many ways for an unpractised girl unless some more
definite advantage lay at the end of it than she could show to be the
case Barnets walk up the slope to the building betrayed that he was in
a dissatisfied mood He hardly saw that the dewy time of day lent an
unusual freshness to the bushes and trees which had so recently put on
their summer habit of heavy leafage and made his newlylaid lawn look as
well established as an old manorial meadow The house had been so
adroitly placed between six tall elms which were growing on the site
beforehand that they seemed like real ancestral trees and the rooks
young and old cawed melodiously to their visitor

The door was not locked and he entered No workmen appeared to be
present and he walked from sunny window to sunny window of the empty
rooms with a sense of seclusion which might have been very pleasant but
for the antecedent knowledge that his almost paternal care of Lucy Savile
was to be thrown away by her wilfulness Footsteps echoed through an
adjoining room and bending his eyes in that direction he perceived Mr
Jones the architect He had come to look over the building before
giving the contractor his final certificate They walked over the house
together Everything was finished except the papering there were the
latest improvements of the period in bellhanging ventilating smoke
jacks firegrates and French windows The business was soon ended and
Jones having directed Barnets attention to a roll of wallpaper
patterns which lay on a bench for his choice was leaving to keep another
engagement when Barnet said Is the tomb finished yet for Mrs Downe

Wellyes it is at last said the architect coming back and speaking
as if he were in a mood to make a confidence I have had no end of
trouble in the matter and to tell the truth I am heartily glad it is
over

Barnet expressed his surprise I thought poor Downe had given up those
extravagant notions of his then he has gone back to the altar and canopy
after all Well he is to be excused poor fellow

O nohe has not at all gone back to themquite the reverse Jones
hastened to say He has so reduced design after design that the whole
thing has been nothing but waste labour for me till in the end it has
become a common headstone which a mason put up in half a day

A common headstone said Barnet

Yes I held out for some time for the addition of a footstone at least
But he said O nohe couldnt afford it

Ah wellhis family is growing up poor fellow and his expenses are
getting serious

Yes exactly said Jones as if the subject were none of his And
again directing Barnets attention to the wallpapers the bustling
architect left him to keep some other engagement

A common headstone murmured Barnet left again to himself He mused a
minute or two and next began looking over and selecting from the
patterns but had not long been engaged in the work when he heard another
footstep on the gravel without and somebody enter the open porch

Barnet went to the doorit was his manservant in search of him

I have been trying for some time to find you sir he said This
letter has come by the post and it is marked immediate And theres
this one from Mr Downe who called just now wanting to see you He
searched his pocket for the second

Barnet took the first letterit had a black border and bore the London
postmark It was not in his wifes handwriting or in that of any person
he knew but conjecture soon ceased as he read the page wherein he was
briefly informed that Mrs Barnet had died suddenly on the previous day
at the furnished villa she had occupied near London

Barnet looked vaguely round the empty hall at the blank walls out of
the doorway Drawing a long palpitating breath and with eyes downcast
he turned and climbed the stairs slowly like a man who doubted their
stability The fact of his wife having as it were died once already
and lived on again had entirely dislodged the possibility of her actual
death from his conjecture He went to the landing leant over the
balusters and after a reverie of whose duration he had but the faintest
notion turned to the window and stretched his gaze to the cottage
further down the road which was visible from his landing and from which
Lucy still walked to the solicitors house by a cross path The faint
words that came from his moving lips were simply At last

Then almost involuntarily Barnet fell down on his knees and murmured
some incoherent words of thanksgiving Surely his virtue in restoring
his wife to life had been rewarded But as if the impulse struck
uneasily on his conscience he quickly rose brushed the dust from his
trousers and set himself to think of his next movements He could not
start for London for some hours and as he had no preparations to make
that could not be made in halfanhour he mechanically descended and
resumed his occupation of turning over the wallpapers They had all got
brighter for him those papers It was all changedwho would sit in the
rooms that they were to line He went on to muse upon Lucys conduct in
so frequently coming to the house with the children her occasional blush
in speaking to him her evident interest in him What woman can in the
long run avoid being interested in a man whom she knows to be devoted to
her If human solicitation could ever effect anything there should be
no going to India for Lucy now All the papers previously chosen seemed
wrong in their shades and he began from the beginning to choose again

While entering on the task he heard a forced Ahem from without the
porch evidently uttered to attract his attention and footsteps again
advancing to the door His man whom he had quite forgotten in his
mental turmoil was still waiting there

I beg your pardon sir the man said from round the doorway but
heres the note from Mr Downe that you didnt take He called just
after you went out and as he couldnt wait he wrote this on your study
table

He handed in the letterno blackbordered one now but a
practicallooking note in the wellknown writing of the solicitor

 DEAR BARNETit ranPerhaps you will be prepared for the
 information I am about to givethat Lucy Savile and myself are going
 to be married this morning I have hitherto said nothing as to my
 intention to any of my friends for reasons which I am sure you will
 fully appreciate The crisis has been brought about by her expressing
 her intention to join her brother in India I then discovered that I
 could not do without her

 It is to be quite a private wedding but it is my particular wish
 that you come down here quietly at ten and go to church with us it
 will add greatly to the pleasure I shall experience in the ceremony
 and I believe to Lucys also I have called on you very early to
 make the request in the belief that I should find you at home but
 you are beforehand with me in your early risingYours sincerely C
 Downe

Need I wait sir said the servant after a dead silence

That will do William No answer said Barnet calmly

When the man had gone Barnet reread the letter Turning eventually to
the wallpapers which he had been at such pains to select he
deliberately tore them into halves and quarters and threw them into the
empty fireplace Then he went out of the house locked the door and
stood in the front awhile Instead of returning into the town he went
down the harbourroad and thoughtfully lingered about by the sea near
the spot where the body of Downes late wife had been found and brought
ashore

Barnet was a man with a rich capacity for misery and there is no doubt
that he exercised it to its fullest extent now The events that had as
it were dashed themselves together into one halfhour of this day showed
that curious refinement of cruelty in their arrangement which often
proceeds from the bosom of the whimsical god at other times known as
blind Circumstance That his few minutes of hope between the reading of
the first and second letters had carried him to extraordinary heights of
rapture was proved by the immensity of his suffering now The sun
blazing into his face would have shown a close watcher that a horizontal
line which he had never noticed before but which was never to be gone
thereafter was somehow gradually forming itself in the smooth of his
forehead His eyes of a light hazel had a curious look which can only
be described by the word bruised the sorrow that looked from them being
largely mixed with the surprise of a man taken unawares

The secondary particulars of his present position too were odd enough
though for some time they appeared to engage little of his attention Not
a soul in the town knew as yet of his wifes death and he almost owed
Downe the kindness of not publishing it till the day was over the
conjuncture taken with that which had accompanied the death of Mrs
Downe being so singular as to be quite sufficient to darken the pleasure
of the impressionable solicitor to a cruel extent if made known to him
But as Barnet could not set out on his journey to London where his wife
lay for some hours there being at this date no railway within a
distance of many miles no great reason existed why he should leave the
town

Impulse in all its forms characterized Barnet and when he heard the
distant clock strike the hour of ten his feet began to carry him up the
harbourroad with the manner of a man who must do something to bring
himself to life He passed Lucy Saviles old house his own new one and
came in view of the church Now he gave a perceptible start and his
mechanical condition went away Before the churchgate were a couple of
carriages and Barnet then could perceive that the marriage between Downe
and Lucy was at that moment being solemnized within A feeling of
sudden proud selfconfidence an indocile wish to walk unmoved in spite
of grim environments plainly possessed him and when he reached the
wicketgate he turned in without apparent effort Pacing up the paved
footway he entered the church and stood for a while in the nave passage
A group of people was standing round the vestry door Barnet advanced
through these and stepped into the vestry

There they were busily signing their names Seeing Downe about to look
round Barnet averted his somewhat disturbed face for a second or two
when he turned again front to front he was calm and quite smiling it was
a creditable triumph over himself and deserved to be remembered in his
native town He greeted Downe heartily offering his congratulations

It seemed as if Barnet expected a halfguilty look upon Lucys face but
no save the natural flush and flurry engendered by the service just
performed there was nothing whatever in her bearing which showed a
disturbed mind her graybrown eyes carried in them now as at other times
the wellknown expression of commonsensed rectitude which never went so
far as to touch on hardness She shook hands with him and Downe said
warmly I wish you could have come sooner I called on purpose to ask
you Youll drive back with us now

No no said Barnet I am not at all prepared but I thought I would
look in upon you for a moment even though I had not time to go home and
dress Ill stand back and see you pass out and observe the effect of
the spectacle upon myself as one of the public

Then Lucy and her husband laughed and Barnet laughed and retired and
the quiet little party went gliding down the nave and towards the porch
Lucys new silk dress sweeping with a smart rustle round the
basemouldings of the ancient font and Downes little daughters
following in a state of roundeyed interest in their position and that
of Lucy their teacher and friend

So Downe was comforted after his Emilys death which had taken place
twelve months two weeks and three days before that time

When the two flys had driven off and the spectators had vanished Barnet
followed to the door and went out into the sun He took no more trouble
to preserve a spruce exterior his step was unequal hesitating almost
convulsive and the slight changes of colour which went on in his face
seemed refracted from some inward flame In the churchyard he became
pale as a summer cloud and finding it not easy to proceed he sat down on
one of the tombstones and supported his head with his hand

Hard by was a sexton filling up a grave which he had not found time to
finish on the previous evening Observing Barnet he went up to him and
recognizing him said Shall I help you home sir

O no thank you said Barnet rousing himself and standing up The
sexton returned to his grave followed by Barnet who after watching him
awhile stepped into the grave now nearly filled and helped to tread in
the earth

The sexton apparently thought his conduct a little singular but he made
no observation and when the grave was full Barnet suddenly stopped
looked far away and with a decided step proceeded to the gate and
vanished The sexton rested on his shovel and looked after him for a few
moments and then began banking up the mound

In those short minutes of treading in the dead man Barnet had formed a
design but what it was the inhabitants of that town did not for some
long time imagine He went home wrote several letters of business
called on his lawyer an old man of the same place who had been the legal
adviser of Barnets father before him and during the evening overhauled
a large quantity of letters and other documents in his possession By
eleven oclock the heap of papers in and before Barnets grate had
reached formidable dimensions and he began to burn them This owing to
their quantity it was not so easy to do as he had expected and he sat
long into the night to complete the task

The next morning Barnet departed for London leaving a note for Downe to
inform him of Mrs Barnets sudden death and that he was gone to bury
her but when a thricesufficient time for that purpose had elapsed he
was not seen again in his accustomed walks or in his new house or in
his old one He was gone for good nobody knew whither It was soon
discovered that he had empowered his lawyer to dispose of all his
property real and personal in the borough and pay in the proceeds to
the account of an unknown person at one of the large London banks The
person was by some supposed to be himself under an assumed name but few
if any had certain knowledge of that fact

The elegant new residence was sold with the rest of his possessions and
its purchaser was no other than Downe now a thriving man in the borough
and one whose growing family and new wife required more roomy
accommodation than was afforded by the little house up the narrow side
street Barnets old habitation was bought by the trustees of the
Congregational Baptist body in that town who pulled down the
timehonoured dwelling and built a new chapel on its site By the time
the last hour of that to Barnet eventful year had chimed every vestige
of him had disappeared from the precincts of his native place and the
name became extinct in the borough of PortBredy after having been a
living force therein for more than two hundred years



CHAPTER IX


Twentyone years and six months do not pass without setting a mark even
upon durable stone and triple brass upon humanity such a period works
nothing less than transformation In Barnets old birthplace vivacious
young children with bones like indiarubber had grown up to be stable men
and women men and women had dried in the skin stiffened withered and
sunk into decrepitude while selections from every class had been
consigned to the outlying cemetery Of inorganic differences the
greatest was that a railway had invaded the town tying it on to a main
line at a junction a dozen miles off Barnets house on the
harbourroad once so insistently new had acquired a respectable
mellowness with ivy Virginia creepers lichens damp patches and even
constitutional infirmities of its own like its elder fellows Its
architecture once so very improved and modern had already become stale
in style without having reached the dignity of being oldfashioned
Trees about the harbourroad had increased in circumference or
disappeared under the saw while the church had had such a tremendous
practical joke played upon it by some facetious restorer or other as to
be scarce recognizable by its dearest old friends

During this long interval George Barnet had never once been seen or heard
of in the town of his fathers

It was the evening of a marketday and some halfdozen middleaged
farmers and dairymen were lounging round the bar of the BlackBull Hotel
occasionally dropping a remark to each other and less frequently to the
two barmaids who stood within the pewtertopped counter in a perfunctory
attitude of attention these latter sighing and making a private
observation to one another at odd intervals on more interesting
experiences than the present

Days get shorter said one of the dairymen as he looked towards the
street and noticed that the lamplighter was passing by

The farmers merely acknowledged by their countenances the propriety of
this remark and finding that nobody else spoke one of the barmaids said
yes in a tone of painful duty

Come fairday we shall have to light up before we start for homealong

Thats true his neighbour conceded with a gaze of blankness

And after that we shant see much further difference alls winter

The rest were not unwilling to go even so far as this

The barmaid sighed again and raised one of her hands from the counter on
which they rested to scratch the smallest surface of her face with the
smallest of her fingers She looked towards the door and presently
remarked I think I hear the bus coming in from station

The eyes of the dairymen and farmers turned to the glass door dividing
the hall from the porch and in a minute or two the omnibus drew up
outside Then there was a lumbering down of luggage and then a man came
into the hall followed by a porter with a portmanteau on his poll which
he deposited on a bench

The stranger was an elderly person with curly ashen white hair a deeply
creviced outer corner to each eyelid and a countenance baked by
innumerable suns to the colour of terracotta its hue and that of his
hair contrasting like heat and cold respectively He walked meditatively
and gently like one who was fearful of disturbing his own mental
equilibrium But whatever lay at the bottom of his breast had evidently
made him so accustomed to its situation there that it caused him little
practical inconvenience

He paused in silence while with his dubious eyes fixed on the barmaids
he seemed to consider himself In a moment or two he addressed them and
asked to be accommodated for the night As he waited he looked curiously
round the hall but said nothing As soon as invited he disappeared up
the staircase preceded by a chambermaid and candle and followed by a
lad with his trunk Not a soul had recognized him

A quarter of an hour later when the farmers and dairymen had driven off
to their homesteads in the country he came downstairs took a biscuit
and one glass of wine and walked out into the town where the radiance
from the shopwindows had grown so in volume of late years as to flood
with cheerfulness every standing cart barrow stall and idler that
occupied the wayside whether shabby or genteel His chief interest at
present seemed to lie in the names painted over the shopfronts and on
doorways as far as they were visible these now differed to an ominous
extent from what they had been oneandtwenty years before

The traveller passed on till he came to the booksellers where he looked
in through the glass door A freshfaced young man was standing behind
the counter otherwise the shop was empty The grayhaired observer
entered asked for some periodical by way of paying for admission and
with his elbow on the counter began to turn over the pages he had bought
though that he read nothing was obvious

At length he said Is old Mr Watkins still alive in a voice which had
a curious youthful cadence in it even now

My father is dead sir said the young man

Ah I am sorry to hear it said the stranger But it is so many years
since I last visited this town that I could hardly expect it should be
otherwise After a short silence he continuedAnd is the firm of
Barnet Browse and Company still in existencethey used to be large
flaxmerchants and twinespinners here

The firm is still going on sir but they have dropped the name of
Barnet I believe that was a sort of fancy nameat least I never knew
of any living Barnet Tis now Browse and Co

And does Andrew Jones still keep on as architect

Hes dead sir

And the Vicar of St MarysMr Melrose

Hes been dead a great many years

Dear me He paused yet longer and cleared his voice Is Mr Downe
the solicitor still in practice

No sir hes dead He died about seven years ago

Here it was a longer silence still and an attentive observer would have
noticed that the paper in the strangers hand increased its imperceptible
tremor to a visible shake That grayhaired gentleman noticed it
himself and rested the paper on the counter Is Mrs Downe still
alive he asked closing his lips firmly as soon as the words were out
of his mouth and dropping his eyes

Yes sir shes alive and well Shes living at the old place

In East Street

O no at Chateau Ringdale I believe it has been in the family for some
generations

She lives with her children perhaps

No she has no children of her own There were some Miss Downes I
think they were Mr Downes daughters by a former wife but they are
married and living in other parts of the town Mrs Downe lives alone

Quite alone

Yes sir quite alone

The newlyarrived gentleman went back to the hotel and dined after which
he made some change in his dress shaved back his beard to the fashion
that had prevailed twenty years earlier when he was young and
interesting and once more emerging bent his steps in the direction of
the harbourroad Just before getting to the point where the pavement
ceased and the houses isolated themselves he overtook a shambling
stooping unshaven man who at first sight appeared like a professional
tramp his shoulders having a perceptible greasiness as they passed under
the gaslight Each pedestrian momentarily turned and regarded the other
and the tramplike gentleman started back

Goodwhyis that Mr Barnet Tis Mr Barnet surely

Yes and you are Charlson

Yesahyou notice my appearance The Fates have rather illused me
Bythebye that fifty pounds I never paid it did I    But I was
not ungrateful Here the stooping man laid one hand emphatically on the
palm of the other I gave you a chance Mr George Barnet which many
men would have thought full value receivedthe chance to marry your
Lucy As far as the world was concerned your wife was a drowned woman
hey

Heaven forbid all that Charlson

Well well twas a wrong way of showing gratitude I suppose And now
a drop of something to drink for old acquaintance sake And Mr Barnet
shes again freetheres a chance now if you care for itha ha And
the speaker pushed his tongue into his hollow cheek and slanted his eye
in the old fashion

I know all said Barnet quickly and slipping a small present into the
hands of the needy saddening man he stepped ahead and was soon in the
outskirts of the town

He reached the harbourroad and paused before the entrance to a well
known house It was so highly bosomed in trees and shrubs planted since
the erection of the building that one would scarcely have recognized the
spot as that which had been a mere neglected slope till chosen as a site
for a dwelling He opened the swinggate closed it noiselessly and
gently moved into the semicircular drive which remained exactly as it
had been marked out by Barnet on the morning when Lucy Savile ran in to
thank him for procuring her the post of governess to Downes children
But the growth of trees and bushes which revealed itself at every step
was beyond all expectation sunproof and moonproof bowers vaulted the
walks and the walls of the house were uniformly bearded with creeping
plants as high as the firstfloor windows

After lingering for a few minutes in the dusk of the bending boughs the
visitor rang the doorbell and on the servant appearing he announced
himself as an old friend of Mrs Downes

The hall was lighted but not brightly the gas being turned low as if
visitors were rare There was a stagnation in the dwelling it seemed to
be waiting Could it really be waiting for him The partitions which
had been probed by Barnets walkingstick when the mortar was green were
now quite brown with the antiquity of their varnish and the ornamental
woodwork of the staircase which had glistened with a pale yellow newness
when first erected was now of a rich winecolour During the servants
absence the following colloquy could be dimly heard through the nearly
closed door of the drawingroom

He didnt give his name

He only said an old friend maam

What kind of gentleman is he

A staidish gentleman with gray hair

The voice of the second speaker seemed to affect the listener greatly
After a pause the lady said Very well I will see him

And the stranger was shown in face to face with the Lucy who had once
been Lucy Savile The round cheek of that formerly young lady had of
course alarmingly flattened its curve in her modern representative a
pervasive grayness overspread her once dark brown hair like morning rime
on heather The parting down the middle was wide and jagged once it had
been a thin white line a narrow crevice between two high banks of shade
But there was still enough left to form a handsome knob behind and some
curls beneath inwrought with a few hairs like silver wires were very
becoming In her eyes the only modification was that their originally
mild rectitude of expression had become a little more stringent than
heretofore Yet she was still girlisha girl who had been gratuitously
weighted by destiny with a burden of fiveandforty years instead of her
proper twenty

Lucy dont you know me he said when the servant had closed the door

I knew you the instant I saw you she returned cheerfully I dont
know why but I always thought you would come back to your old town
again

She gave him her hand and then they sat down They said you were
dead continued Lucy but I never thought so We should have heard of
it for certain if you had been

It is a very long time since we met

Yes what you must have seen Mr Barnet in all these roving years in
comparison with what I have seen in this quiet place Her face grew
more serious You know my husband has been dead a long time I am a
lonely old woman now considering what I have been though Mr Downes
daughtersall marriedmanage to keep me pretty cheerful

And I am a lonely old man and have been any time these twenty years

But where have you kept yourself And why did you go off so
mysteriously

Well Lucy I have kept myself a little in America and a little in
Australia a little in India a little at the Cape and so on I have not
stayed in any place for a long time as it seems to me and yet more than
twenty years have flown But when people get to my age two years go like
oneYour second question why did I go away so mysteriously is surely
not necessary You guessed why didnt you

No I never once guessed she said simply nor did Charles nor did
anybody as far as I know

Well indeed Now think it over again and then look at me and say if
you cant guess

She looked him in the face with an inquiring smile Surely not because
of me she said pausing at the commencement of surprise

Barnet nodded and smiled again but his smile was sadder than hers

Because I married Charles she asked

Yes solely because you married him on the day I was free to ask you to
marry me My wife died fourandtwenty hours before you went to church
with Downe The fixing of my journey at that particular moment was
because of her funeral but once away I knew I should have no inducement
to come back and took my steps accordingly

Her face assumed an aspect of gentle reflection and she looked up and
down his form with great interest in her eyes I never thought of it
she said I knew of course that you had once implied some warmth of
feeling towards me but I concluded that it passed off And I have
always been under the impression that your wife was alive at the time of
my marriage Was it not stupid of meBut you will have some tea or
something I have never dined late you know since my husbands death
I have got into the way of making a regular meal of tea You will have
some tea with me will you not

The travelled man assented quite readily and tea was brought in They
sat and chatted over the meal regardless of the flying hour Well
well said Barnet presently as for the first time he leisurely surveyed
the room how like it all is and yet how different Just where your
piano stands was a board on a couple of trestles bearing the patterns of
wallpapers when I was last here I was choosing themstanding in this
way as it might be Then my servant came in at the door and handed me
a note so It was from Downe and announced that you were just going to
be married to him I chose no more wallpaperstore up all those I had
selected and left the house I never entered it again till now

Ah at last I understand it all she murmured

They had both risen and gone to the fireplace The mantel came almost on
a level with her shoulder which gently rested against it and Barnet
laid his hand upon the shelf close beside her shoulder Lucy he said
better late than never Will you marry me now

She started back and the surprise which was so obvious in her wrought
even greater surprise in him that it should be so It was difficult to
believe that she had been quite blind to the situation and yet all
reason and common sense went to prove that she was not acting

You take me quite unawares by such a question she said with a forced
laugh of uneasiness It was the first time she had shown any
embarrassment at all Why she added I couldnt marry you for the
world

Not after all this Why not

It isI wouldI really think I may say itI would upon the whole
rather marry you Mr Barnet than any other man I have ever met if I
ever dreamed of marriage again But I dont dream of itit is quite out
of my thoughts I have not the least intention of marrying again

Buton my accountcouldnt you alter your plans a little Come

Dear Mr Barnet she said with a little flutter I would on your
account if on anybodys in existence But you dont know in the least
what it is you are askingsuch an impracticable thingI wont say
ridiculous of course because I see that you are really in earnest and
earnestness is never ridiculous to my mind

Well yes said Barnet more slowly dropping her hand which he had
taken at the moment of pleading I am in earnest The resolve two
months ago at the Cape to come back once more was it is true rather
sudden and as I see now not well considered But I am in earnest in
asking

And I in declining With all good feeling and all kindness let me say
that I am quite opposed to the idea of marrying a second time

Well no harm has been done he answered with the same subdued and
tender humorousness that he had shown on such occasions in early life
If you really wont accept me I must put up with it I suppose His
eye fell on the clock as he spoke Had you any notion that it was so
late he asked How absorbed I have been

She accompanied him to the hall helped him to put on his overcoat and
let him out of the house herself

Goodnight said Barnet on the doorstep as the lamp shone in his
face You are not offended with me

Certainly not Nor you with me

Ill consider whether I am or not he pleasantly replied Goodnight

She watched him safely through the gate and when his footsteps had died
away upon the road closed the door softly and returned to the room Here
the modest widow long pondered his speeches with eyes dropped to an
unusually low level Barnets urbanity under the blow of her refusal
greatly impressed her After having his long period of probation
rendered useless by her decision he had shown no anger and had
philosophically taken her words as if he deserved no better ones It was
very gentlemanly of him certainly it was more than gentlemanly it was
heroic and grand The more she meditated the more she questioned the
virtue of her conduct in checking him so peremptorily and went to her
bedroom in a mood of dissatisfaction On looking in the glass she was
reminded that there was not so much remaining of her former beauty as to
make his frank declaration an impulsive natural homage to her cheeks and
eyes it must undoubtedly have arisen from an old staunch feeling of his
deserving tenderest consideration She recalled to her mind with much
pleasure that he had told her he was staying at the BlackBull Hotel so
that if after waiting a day or two he should not in his modesty call
again she might then send him a nice little note To alter her views
for the present was far from her intention but she would allow herself
to be induced to reconsider the case as any generous woman ought to do

The morrow came and passed and Mr Barnet did not drop in At every
knock light youthful hues flew across her cheek and she was abstracted
in the presence of her other visitors In the evening she walked about
the house not knowing what to do with herself the conditions of
existence seemed totally different from those which ruled only fourand
twenty short hours ago What had been at first a tantalizing elusive
sentiment was getting acclimatized within her as a definite hope and her
person was so informed by that emotion that she might almost have stood
as its emblematical representative by the time the clock struck ten In
short an interest in Barnet precisely resembling that of her early youth
led her present heart to belie her yesterdays words to him and she
longed to see him again

The next day she walked out early thinking she might meet him in the
street The growing beauty of her romance absorbed her and she went
from the street to the fields and from the fields to the shore without
any consciousness of distance till reminded by her weariness that she
could go no further He had nowhere appeared In the evening she took a
step which under the circumstances seemed justifiable she wrote a note
to him at the hotel inviting him to tea with her at six precisely and
signing her note Lucy

In a quarter of an hour the messenger came back Mr Barnet had left the
hotel early in the morning of the day before but he had stated that he
would probably return in the course of the week

The note was sent back to be given to him immediately on his arrival

There was no sign from the inn that this desired event had occurred
either on the next day or the day following On both nights she had been
restless and had scarcely slept halfanhour

On the Saturday putting off all diffidence Lucy went herself to the
BlackBull and questioned the staff closely

Mr Barnet had cursorily remarked when leaving that he might return on
the Thursday or Friday but they were directed not to reserve a room for
him unless he should write

He had left no address

Lucy sorrowfully took back her note went home and resolved to wait

She did waityears and yearsbut Barnet never reappeared

April 1880




INTERLOPERS AT THE KNAP


CHAPTER I


The north road from Casterbridge is tedious and lonely especially in
wintertime Along a part of its course it connects with LongAsh Lane
a monotonous track without a village or hamlet for many miles and with
very seldom a turning Unapprized wayfarers who are too old or too
young or in other respects too weak for the distance to be traversed
but who nevertheless have to walk it say as they look wistfully
ahead Once at the top of that hill and I must surely see the end of
LongAsh Lane But they reach the hilltop and LongAsh Lane stretches
in front as mercilessly as before

Some few years ago a certain farmer was riding through this lane in the
gloom of a winter evening The farmers friend a dairyman was riding
beside him A few paces in the rear rode the farmers man All three
were well horsed on strong roundbarrelled cobs and to be well horsed
was to be in better spirits about LongAsh Lane than poor pedestrians
could attain to during its passage

But the farmer did not talk much to his friend as he rode along The
enterprise which had brought him there filled his mind for in truth it
was important Not altogether so important was it perhaps when
estimated by its value to society at large but if the true measure of a
deed be proportionate to the space it occupies in the heart of him who
undertakes it Farmer Charles Dartons business tonight could hold its
own with the business of kings

He was a large farmer His turnover as it is called was probably
thirty thousand pounds a year He had a great many draught horses a
great many milch cows and of sheep a multitude This comfortable
position was however none of his own making It had been created by
his father a man of a very different stamp from the present
representative of the line

Darton the father had been a oneidead character with a buttonedup
pocket and a chinklike eye brimming with commercial subtlety In Darton
the son this trade subtlety had become transmuted into emotional and
the harshness had disappeared he would have been called a sad man but
for his constant care not to divide himself from lively friends by piping
notes out of harmony with theirs Contemplative he allowed his mind to
be a quiet meetingplace for memories and hopes So that naturally
enough since succeeding to the agricultural calling and up to his
present age of thirtytwo he had neither advanced nor receded as a
capitalista stationary result which did not agitate one of his
unambitious unstrategic nature since he had all that he desired The
motive of his expedition tonight showed the same absence of anxious
regard for Number One

The party rode on in the slow safe trot proper to nighttime and bad
roads Farmer Dartons head jigging rather unromantically up and down
against the sky and his motions being repeated with bolder emphasis by
his friend Japheth Johns while those of the latter were travestied in
jerks still less softened by art in the person of the lad who attended
them A pair of whitish objects hung one on each side of the latter
bumping against him at each step and still further spoiling the grace of
his seat On close inspection they might have been perceived to be open
rush basketsone containing a turkey and the other some bottles of
wine

Dye feel ye can meet your fate like a man neighbour Darton asked
Johns breaking a silence which had lasted while fiveandtwenty hedgerow
trees had glided by

Mr Darton with a halflaugh murmured Aycall it my fate Hanging and
wiving go by destiny And then they were silent again

The darkness thickened rapidly at intervals shutting down on the land in
a perceptible flap like the wave of a wing The customary close of day
was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air With the fall of
night had come a mist just damp enough to incommode but not sufficient
to saturate them Countrymen as they wereborn as may be said with
only an open door between them and the four seasonsthey regarded the
mist but as an added obscuration and ignored its humid quality

They were travelling in a direction that was enlivened by no modern
current of traffic the place of Dartons pilgrimage being an
oldfashioned villageone of the Hintocks several villages of that
name with a distinctive prefix or affix lying thereaboutwhere the
people make the best cider and ciderwine in all Wessex and where the
dunghills smell of pomace instead of stable refuse as elsewhere The
lane was sometimes so narrow that the brambles of the hedge which hung
forward like anglers rods over a stream scratched their hats and curry
combed their whiskers as they passed Yet this neglected lane had been a
highway to Queen Elizabeths subjects and the cavalcades of the past Its
day was over now and its history as a national artery done for ever

Why I have decided to marry her resumed Darton in a measured musical
voice of confidence which revealed a good deal of his composition as he
glanced round to see that the lad was not too near is not only that I
like her but that I can do no better even from a fairly practical point
of view That I might ha looked higher is possibly true though it is
really all nonsense I have had experience enough in looking above me
No more superior women for me said Iyou know when Sally is a
comely independent simple character with no makeup about her wholl
think me as much a superior to her as I used to thinkyou know who I
meanwas to me

Ay said Johns However I shouldnt call Sally Hall simple Primary
because no Sally is secondary because if some could be this one
wouldnt Tis a wrong denomination to apply to a woman Charles and
affects me as your best man like cold water Tis like recommending a
stage play by saying theres neither murder villainy nor harm of any
sort in it when thats what youve paid your halfcrown to see

Well may your opinion do you good Mines a different one And
turning the conversation from the philosophical to the practical Darton
expressed a hope that the said Sally had received what hed sent on by
the carrier that day

Johns wanted to know what that was

It is a dress said Darton Not exactly a weddingdress though she
may use it as one if she likes It is rather serviceable than
showysuitable for the winter weather

Good said Johns Serviceable is a wise word in a bridegroom I
commend ye Charles

For said Darton why should a woman dress up like a ropedancer
because shes going to do the most solemn deed of her life except dying

Faith why But she will because she will I suppose said Dairyman
Johns

Hm said Darton

The lane they followed had been nearly straight for several miles but it
now took a turn and winding uncertainly for some distance forked into
two By night country roads are apt to reveal ungainly qualities which
pass without observation during day and though Darton had travelled this
way before he had not done so frequently Sally having been wooed at the
house of a relative near his own He never remembered seeing at this
spot a pair of alternative ways looking so equally probable as these two
did now Johns rode on a few steps

Dont be out of heart sonny he cried Heres a handpost Enochcome
and climm this post and tell us the way

The lad dismounted and jumped into the hedge where the post stood under
a tree

Unstrap the baskets or youll smash up that wine cried Darton as the
young man began spasmodically to climb the post baskets and all

Was there ever less head in a brainless world said Johns Here
simple Nocky Ill do it He leapt off and with much puffing climbed
the post striking a match when he reached the top and moving the light
along the arm the lad standing and gazing at the spectacle

I have faced tantalization these twenty years with a temper as mild as
milk said Japheth but such things as this dont come short of
devilry And flinging the match away he slipped down to the ground

Whats the matter asked Darton

Not a letter sacred or heathennot so much as would tell us the way to
the great fireplaceever I should sin to say it Either the moss and
mildew have eat away the words or we have arrived in a land where the
natyves have lost the art o writing and should ha brought our compass
like Christopher Columbus

Let us take the straightest road said Darton placidly I shant be
sorry to get theretis a tiresome ride I would have driven if I had
known

Nor I neither sir said Enoch These straps plough my shoulder like
a zull If tis much further to your ladys home Maister Darton I
shall ask to be let carry half of these good things in my innerdshee
hee

Dont you be such a reforming radical Enoch said Johns sternly
Here Ill take the turkey

This being done they went forward by the righthand lane which ascended
a hill the left winding away under a plantation The pitapat of their
horses hoofs lessened up the slope and the ironical directingpost
stood in solitude as before holding out its blank arms to the raw
breeze which brought a snore from the wood as if Skrymir the Giant were
sleeping there



CHAPTER II


Three miles to the left of the travellers along the road they had not
followed rose an old house with mullioned windows of Hamhill stone and
chimneys of lavish solidity It stood at the top of a slope beside
KingsHintock villagestreet and immediately in front of it grew a
large sycamoretree whose bared roots formed a convenient staircase from
the road below to the front door of the dwelling Its situation gave the
house what little distinctive name it possessed namely The Knap Some
forty yards off a brook dribbled past which for its size made a great
deal of noise At the back was a dairy barton accessible for vehicles
and livestock by a side drong Thus much only of the character of the
homestead could be divined out of doors at this shady eveningtime

But within there was plenty of light to see by as plenty was construed
at Hintock Beside a Tudor fireplace whose moulded fourcentred arch
was nearly hidden by a figured bluecloth blower were seated two
womenmother and daughterMrs Hall and Sarah or Sally for this was
a part of the world where the latter modification had not as yet been
effaced as a vulgarity by the march of intellect The owner of the name
was the young woman by whose means Mr Darton proposed to put an end to
his bachelor condition on the approaching day

The mothers bereavement had been so long ago as not to leave much mark
of its occurrence upon her now either in face or clothes She had
resumed the mobcap of her early married life enlivening its whiteness
by a few roseduBarry ribbons Sally required no such aids to pinkness
Roseate goodnature lit up her gaze her features showed curves of
decision and judgment and she might have been regarded without much
mistake as a warmhearted quickspirited handsome girl

She did most of the talking her mother listening with a halfabsent air
as she picked up fragments of redhot wood ember with the tongs and
piled them upon the brands But the number of speeches that passed was
very small in proportion to the meanings exchanged Long experience
together often enabled them to see the course of thought in each others
minds without a word being spoken Behind them in the centre of the
room the table was spread for supper certain whiffs of air laden with
fat vapours which ever and anon entered from the kitchen denoting its
preparation there

The new gown he was going to send you stays about on the way like
himself Sallys mother was saying

Yes not finished I daresay cried Sally independently Lord I
shouldnt be amazed if it didnt come at all Young men make such kind
promises when they are near you and forget em when they go away But
he doesnt intend it as a weddinggownhe gives it to me merely as a
gown to wear when I likea travellingdress is what it would be called
by some Come rathe or come late it dont much matter as I have a dress
of my own to fall back upon But what time is it

She went to the family clock and opened the glass for the hour was not
otherwise discernible by night and indeed at all times was rather a
thing to be investigated than beheld so much more wall than window was
there in the apartment It is nearly eight said she

Eight oclock and neither dress nor man said Mrs Hall

Mother if you think to tantalize me by talking like that you are much
mistaken Let him be as late as he willor stay away altogetherI
dont care said Sally But a tender minute quaver in the negation
showed that there was something forced in that statement

Mrs Hall perceived it and drily observed that she was not so sure about
Sally not caring But perhaps you dont care so much as I do after
all she said For I see what you dont that it is a good and
flourishing match for you a very honourable offer in Mr Darton And I
think I see a kind husband in him So pray God twill go smooth and
wind up well

Sally would not listen to misgivings Of course it would go smoothly
she asserted How you are up and down mother she went on At this
moment whatever hinders him we are not so anxious to see him as he is
to be here and his thought runs on before him and settles down upon us
like the star in the east Hark she exclaimed with a breath of
relief her eyes sparkling I heard something Yeshere they are

The next moment her mothers slower ear also distinguished the familiar
reverberation occasioned by footsteps clambering up the roots of the
sycamore

Yes it sounds like them at last she said Well it is not so very
late after all considering the distance

The footfall ceased and they arose expecting a knock They began to
think it might have been after all some neighbouring villager under
Bacchic influence giving the centre of the road a wide berth when their
doubts were dispelled by the newcomers entry into the passage The
door of the room was gently opened and there appeared not the pair of
travellers with whom we have already made acquaintance but a palefaced
man in the garb of extreme povertyalmost in rags

O its a trampgracious me said Sally starting back

His cheeks and eyeorbits were deep concavesrather it might be from
natural weakness of constitution than irregular living though there were
indications that he had led no careful life He gazed at the two women
fixedly for a moment then with an abashed humiliated demeanour dropped
his glance to the floor and sank into a chair without uttering a word

Sally was in advance of her mother who had remained standing by the
fire She now tried to discern the visitor across the candles

Whymother said Sally faintly turning back to Mrs Hall It is
Phil from Australia

Mrs Hall started and grew pale and a fit of coughing seized the man
with the ragged clothes To come home like this she said O
Philipare you ill

No no mother replied he impatiently as soon as he could speak

But for Gods sake how do you come hereand just now too

Well I am here said the man How it is I hardly know Ive come
home mother because I was driven to it Things were against me out
there and went from bad to worse

Then why didnt you let us knowyouve not writ a line for the last
two or three years

The son admitted sadly that he had not He said that he had hoped and
thought he might fetch up again and be able to send good news Then he
had been obliged to abandon that hope and had finally come home from
sheer necessitypreviously to making a new start Yes things are very
bad with me he repeated perceiving their commiserating glances at his
clothes

They brought him nearer the fire took his hat from his thin hand which
was so small and smooth as to show that his attempts to fetch up again
had not been in a manual direction His mother resumed her inquiries
and dubiously asked if he had chosen to come that particular night for
any special reason

For no reason he told her His arrival had been quite at random Then
Philip Hall looked round the room and saw for the first time that the
table was laid somewhat luxuriously and for a larger number than
themselves and that an air of festivity pervaded their dress He asked
quickly what was going on

Sally is going to be married in a day or two replied the mother and
she explained how Mr Darton Sallys intended husband was coming there
that night with the groomsman Mr Johns and other details We thought
it must be their step when we heard you said Mrs Hall

The needy wanderer looked again on the floor I seeI see he
murmured Why indeed should I have come tonight Such folk as I are
not wanted here at these times naturally And I have no business
herespoiling other peoples happiness

Phil said his mother with a tear in her eye but with a thinness of
lip and severity of manner which were presumably not more than past
events justified since you speak like that to me Ill speak honestly
to you For these three years you have taken no thought for us You
left home with a good supply of money and strength and education and
you ought to have made good use of it all But you come back like a
beggar and that you come in a very awkward time for us cannot be denied
Your return tonight may do us much harm But mindyou are welcome to
this home as long as it is mine I dont wish to turn you adrift We
will make the best of a bad job and I hope you are not seriously ill

O no I have only this infernal cough

She looked at him anxiously I think you had better go to bed at once
she said

WellI shall be out of the way there said the son wearily Having
ruined myself dont let me ruin you by being seen in these togs for
Heavens sake Who do you say Sally is going to be married toa Farmer
Darton

Yesa gentlemanfarmerquite a wealthy man Far better in station
than she could have expected It is a good thing altogether

Well done little Sal said her brother brightening and looking up at
her with a smile I ought to have written but perhaps I have thought
of you all the more But let me get out of sight I would rather go and
jump into the river than be seen here But have you anything I can
drink I am confoundedly thirsty with my long tramp

Yes yes we will bring something upstairs to you said Sally with
grief in her face

Ay that will do nicely But Sally and mother He stopped and they
waited Mother I have not told you all he resumed slowly still
looking on the floor between his knees Sad as what you see of me is
theres worse behind

His mother gazed upon him in grieved suspense and Sally went and leant
upon the bureau listening for every sound and sighing Suddenly she
turned round saying Let them come I dont care Philip tell the
worst and take your time

Well then said the unhappy Phil I am not the only one in this mess
Would to Heaven I were But

O Phil

I have a wife as destitute as I

A wife said his mother

Unhappily

A wife Yes that is the way with sons

And besides said he

Besides O Philip surely

I have two little children

Wife and children whispered Mrs Hall sinking down confounded

Poor little things said Sally involuntarily

His mother turned again to him I suppose these helpless beings are
left in Australia

No They are in England

Well I can only hope youve left them in a respectable place

I have not left them at all They are herewithin a few yards of us
In short they are in the stable

Where

In the stable I did not like to bring them indoors till I had seen
you mother and broken the bad news a bit to you They were very tired
and are resting out there on some straw

Mrs Halls fortitude visibly broke down She had been brought up not
without refinement and was even more moved by such a collapse of genteel
aims as this than a substantial dairymans widow would in ordinary have
been moved Well it must be borne she said in a low voice with her
hands tightly joined A starving son a starving wife starving
children Let it be But why is this come to us now today tonight
Could no other misfortune happen to helpless women than this which will
quite upset my poor girls chance of a happy life Why have you done us
this wrong Philip What respectable man will come here and marry open
eyed into a family of vagabonds

Nonsense mother said Sally vehemently while her face flushed
Charley isnt the man to desert me But if he should be and wont
marry me because Phils come let him go and marry elsewhere I wont be
ashamed of my own flesh and blood for any man in Englandnot I And
then Sally turned away and burst into tears

Wait till you are twenty years older and you will tell a different
tale replied her mother

The son stood up Mother he said bitterly as I have come so I will
go All I ask of you is that you will allow me and mine to lie in your
stable tonight I give you my word that well be gone by break of day
and trouble you no further

Mrs Hall the mother changed at that O no she answered hastily
never shall it be said that I sent any of my own family from my door
Bring em in Philip or take me out to them

We will put em all into the large bedroom said Sally brightening
and make up a large fire Lets go and help them in and call Rebekah
Rebekah was the woman who assisted at the dairy and housework she lived
in a cottage hard by with her husband who attended to the cows

Sally went to fetch a lantern from the backkitchen but her brother
said You wont want a light I lit the lantern that was hanging
there

What must we call your wife asked Mrs Hall

Helena said Philip

With shawls over their heads they proceeded towards the back door

One minute before you go interrupted Philip II havent confessed
all

Then Heaven help us said Mrs Hall pushing to the door and clasping
her hands in calm despair

We passed through Evershead as we came he continued and I just
looked in at the SowandAcorn to see if old Mike still kept on there
as usual The carrier had come in from Sherton Abbas at that moment and
guessing that I was bound for this placefor I think he knew mehe
asked me to bring on a dressmakers parcel for Sally that was marked
immediate My wife had walked on with the children Twas a flimsy
parcel and the paper was torn and I found on looking at it that it was
a thick warm gown I didnt wish you to see poor Helena in a shabby
state I was ashamed that you shouldtwas not what she was born to I
untied the parcel in the road took it on to her where she was waiting in
the Lower Barn and told her I had managed to get it for her and that
she was to ask no question She poor thing must have supposed I
obtained it on trust through having reached a place where I was known
for she put it on gladly enough She has it on now Sally has other
gowns I daresay

Sally looked at her mother speechless

You have others I daresay repeated Phil with a sick mans
impatience I thought to myself Better Sally cry than Helena freeze
Well is the dress of great consequence Twas nothing very ornamental
as far as I could see

Nono not of consequence returned Sally sadly adding in a gentle
voice You will not mind if I lend her another instead of that one will
you

Philips agitation at the confession had brought on another attack of the
cough which seemed to shake him to pieces He was so obviously unfit to
sit in a chair that they helped him upstairs at once and having hastily
given him a cordial and kindled the bedroom fire they descended to fetch
their unhappy new relations



CHAPTER III


It was with strange feelings that the girl and her mother lately so
cheerful passed out of the back door into the open air of the barton
laden with hay scents and the herby breath of cows A fine sleet had
begun to fall and they trotted across the yard quickly The stabledoor
was open a light shone from itfrom the lantern which always hung
there and which Philip had lighted as he said Softly nearing the
door Mrs Hall pronounced the name Helena

There was no answer for the moment Looking in she was taken by
surprise Two people appeared before her For one instead of the
drabbish woman she had expected Mrs Hall saw a pale darkeyed
ladylike creature whose personality ruled her attire rather than was
ruled by it She was in a new and handsome gown of course and an old
bonnet She was standing up agitated her hand was held by her
companionnone else than Sallys affianced Farmer Charles Darton upon
whose fine figure the pale strangers eyes were fixed as his were fixed
upon her His other hand held the rein of his horse which was standing
saddled as if just led in

At sight of Mrs Hall they both turned looking at her in a way neither
quite conscious nor unconscious and without seeming to recollect that
words were necessary as a solution to the scene In another moment Sally
entered also when Mr Darton dropped his companions hand led the horse
aside and came to greet his betrothed and Mrs Hall

Ah he said smilingwith something like forced composurethis is a
roundabout way of arriving you will say my dear Mrs Hall But we lost
our way which made us late I saw a light here and led in my horse at
oncemy friend Johns and my man have gone back to the little inn with
theirs not to crowd you too much No sooner had I entered than I saw
that this lady had taken temporary shelter hereand found I was
intruding

She is my daughterinlaw said Mrs Hall calmly My son too is in
the house but he has gone to bed unwell

Sally had stood staring wonderingly at the scene until this moment
hardly recognizing Dartons shake of the hand The spell that bound her
was broken by her perceiving the two little children seated on a heap of
hay She suddenly went forward spoke to them and took one on her arm
and the other in her hand

And two children said Mr Darton showing thus that he had not been
there long enough as yet to understand the situation

My grandchildren said Mrs Hall with as much affected ease as before

Philip Halls wife in spite of this interruption to her first
rencounter seemed scarcely so much affected by it as to feel any ones
presence in addition to Mr Dartons However arousing herself by a
quick reflection she threw a sudden critical glance of her sad eyes upon
Mrs Hall and apparently finding her satisfactory advanced to her in a
meek initiative Then Sally and the stranger spoke some friendly words
to each other and Sally went on with the children into the house Mrs
Hall and Helena followed and Mr Darton followed these looking at
Helenas dress and outline and listening to her voice like a man in a
dream

By the time the others reached the house Sally had already gone upstairs
with the tired children She rapped against the wall for Rebekah to come
in and help to attend to them Rebekahs house being a little spitand
dab cabin leaning against the substantial stonework of Mrs Halls
taller erection When she came a bed was made up for the little ones
and some supper given to them On descending the stairs after seeing
this done Sally went to the sittingroom Young Mrs Hall entered it
just in advance of her having in the interim retired with her motherin
law to take off her bonnet and otherwise make herself presentable Hence
it was evident that no further communication could have passed between
her and Mr Darton since their brief interview in the stable

Mr Japheth Johns now opportunely arrived and broke up the restraint of
the company after a few orthodox meteorological commentaries had passed
between him and Mrs Hall by way of introduction They at once sat down
to supper the present of wine and turkey not being produced for
consumption tonight lest the premature display of those gifts should
seem to throw doubt on Mrs Halls capacities as a provider

Drink hearty Mr Johnsdrink hearty said that matron magnanimously
Such as it is theres plenty of But perhaps ciderwine is not to your
tastethough theres body in it

Quite the contrairy maamquite the contrairy said the dairyman
For though I inherit the maltliquor principle from my father I am a
ciderdrinker on my mothers side She came from these parts you know
And theres this to be said forttis a more peaceful liquor and dont
lie about a man like your hotter drinks With care one may live on it a
twelvemonth without knocking down a neighbour or getting a black eye
from an old acquaintance

The general conversation thus begun was continued briskly though it was
in the main restricted to Mrs Hall and Japheth who in truth required
but little help from anybody There being slight call upon Sallys
tongue she had ample leisure to do what her heart most desired namely
watch her intended husband and her sisterinlaw with a view of
elucidating the strange momentary scene in which her mother and herself
had surprised them in the stable If that scene meant anything it
meant at least that they had met before That there had been no time
for explanations Sally could see for their manner was still one of
suppressed amazement at each others presence there Dartons eyes too
fell continually on the gown worn by Helena as if this were an added
riddle to his perplexity though to Sally it was the one feature in the
case which was no mystery He seemed to feel that fate had impishly
changed his visavis in the lovers jig he was about to foot that while
the gown had been expected to enclose a Sally a Helenas face looked out
from the bodice that some longlost hand met his own from the sleeves

Sally could see that whatever Helena might know of Darton she knew
nothing of how the dress entered into his embarrassment And at moments
the young girl would have persuaded herself that Dartons looks at her
sisterinlaw were entirely the fruit of the clothes query But surely
at other times a more extensive range of speculation and sentiment was
expressed by her lovers eye than that which the changed dress would
account for

Sallys independence made her one of the least jealous of women But
there was something in the relations of these two visitors which ought to
be explained

Japheth Johns continued to converse in his wellknown style
interspersing his talk with some private reflections on the position of
Darton and Sally which though the sparkle in his eye showed them to be
highly entertaining to himself were apparently not quite communicable to
the company At last he withdrew for the night going off to the
roadside inn halfamile back whither Darton promised to follow him in a
few minutes

Halfanhour passed and then Mr Darton also rose to leave Sally and
her sisterinlaw simultaneously wishing him goodnight as they retired
upstairs to their rooms But on his arriving at the front door with Mrs
Hall a sharp shower of rain began to come down when the widow suggested
that he should return to the fireside till the storm ceased

Darton accepted her proposal but insisted that as it was getting late
and she was obviously tired she should not sit up on his account since
he could let himself out of the house and would quite enjoy smoking a
pipe by the hearth alone Mrs Hall assented and Darton was left by
himself He spread his knees to the brands lit up his tobacco as he had
said and sat gazing into the fire and at the notches of the chimney
crook which hung above

An occasional drop of rain rolled down the chimney with a hiss and still
he smoked on but not like a man whose mind was at rest In the long
run however despite his meditations early hours afield and a long ride
in the open air produced their natural result He began to doze

How long he remained in this halfunconscious state he did not know He
suddenly opened his eyes The backbrand had burnt itself in two and
ceased to flame the light which he had placed on the mantelpiece had
nearly gone out But in spite of these deficiencies there was a light in
the apartment and it came from elsewhere Turning his head he saw
Philip Halls wife standing at the entrance of the room with a bedcandle
in one hand a small brass teakettle in the other and his gown as it
certainly seemed still upon her

Helena said Darton starting up

Her countenance expressed dismay and her first words were an apology
Idid not know you were here Mr Darton she said while a blush
flashed to her cheek I thought every one had retiredI was coming to
make a little water boil my husband seems to be worse But perhaps the
kitchen fire can be lighted up again

Dont go on my account By all means put it on here as you intended
said Darton Allow me to help you He went forward to take the kettle
from her hand but she did not allow him and placed it on the fire
herself

They stood some way apart one on each side of the fireplace waiting
till the water should boil the candle on the mantel between them and
Helena with her eyes on the kettle Darton was the first to break the
silence Shall I call Sally he said

O no she quickly returned We have given trouble enough already We
have no right here But we are the sport of fate and were obliged to
come

No right here said he in surprise

None I cant explain it now answered Helena This kettle is very
slow

There was another pause the proverbial dilatoriness of watched pots was
never more clearly exemplified

Helenas face was of that sort which seems to ask for assistance without
the owners knowledgethe very antipodes of Sallys which was
selfreliance expressed Dartons eyes travelled from the kettle to
Helenas face then back to the kettle then to the face for rather a
longer time So I am not to know anything of the mystery that has
distracted me all the evening he said How is it that a woman who
refused me because as I supposed my position was not good enough for
her taste is found to be the wife of a man who certainly seems to be
worse off than I

He had the prior claim said she

What you knew him at that time

Yes yes Please say no more she implored

Whatever my errors I have paid for them during the last five years

The heart of Darton was subject to sudden overflowings He was kind to a
fault I am sorry from my soul he said involuntarily approaching
her Helena withdrew a step or two at which he became conscious of his
movement and quickly took his former place Here he stood without
speaking and the little kettle began to sing

Well you might have been my wife if you had chosen he said at last
But thats all past and gone However if you are in any trouble or
poverty I shall be glad to be of service and as your relation by
marriage I shall have a right to be Does your uncle know of your
distress

My uncle is dead He left me without a farthing And now we have two
children to maintain

What left you nothing How could he be so cruel as that

I disgraced myself in his eyes

Now said Darton earnestly let me take care of the children at least
while you are so unsettled You belong to another so I cannot take care
of you

Yes you can said a voice and suddenly a third figure stood beside
them It was Sally You can since you seem to wish to she repeated
She no longer belongs to another    My poor brother is dead

Her face was red her eyes sparkled and all the woman came to the front
I have heard it she went on to him passionately You can protect her
now as well as the children She turned then to her agitated sisterin
law I heard something said Sally in a gentle murmur differing much
from her previous passionate words and I went into his room It must
have been the moment you left He went off so quickly and weakly and
it was so unexpected that I couldnt leave even to call you

Darton was just able to gather from the confused discourse which followed
that during his sleep by the fire this brother whom he had never seen
had become worse and that during Helenas absence for water the end had
unexpectedly come The two young women hastened upstairs and he was
again left alone

    

After standing there a short time he went to the front door and looked
out till softly closing it behind him he advanced and stood under the
large sycamoretree The stars were flickering coldly and the dampness
which had just descended upon the earth in rain now sent up a chill from
it Darton was in a strange position and he felt it The unexpected
appearance in deep poverty of Helenaa young lady daughter of a
deceased naval officer who had been brought up by her uncle a
solicitor and had refused Darton in marriage years agothe passionate
almost angry demeanour of Sally at discovering them the abrupt
announcement that Helena was a widow all this coming together was a
conjuncture difficult to cope with in a moment and made him question
whether he ought to leave the house or offer assistance But for Sallys
manner he would unhesitatingly have done the latter

He was still standing under the tree when the door in front of him
opened and Mrs Hall came out She went round to the gardengate at the
side without seeing him Darton followed her intending to speak

Pausing outside as if in thought she proceeded to a spot where the sun
came earliest in springtime and where the north wind never blew it was
where the row of beehives stood under the wall Discerning her object
he waited till she had accomplished it

It was the universal custom thereabout to wake the bees by tapping at
their hives whenever a death occurred in the household under the belief
that if this were not done the bees themselves would pine away and perish
during the ensuing year As soon as an interior buzzing responded to her
tap at the first hive Mrs Hall went on to the second and thus passed
down the row As soon as she came back he met her

What can I do in this trouble Mrs Hall he said

Onothing thank you nothing she said in a tearful voice now just
perceiving him We have called Rebekah and her husband and they will
do everything necessary She told him in a few words the particulars of
her sons arrival broken in healthindeed at deaths very door though
they did not suspect itand suggested as the result of a conversation
between her and her daughter that the wedding should be postponed

Yes of course said Darton I think now to go straight to the inn
and tell Johns what has happened It was not till after he had shaken
hands with her that he turned hesitatingly and added Will you tell the
mother of his children that as they are now left fatherless I shall be
glad to take the eldest of them if it would be any convenience to her
and to you

Mrs Hall promised that her sons widow should he told of the offer and
they parted He retired down the rooty slope and disappeared in the
direction of the inn where he informed Johns of the circumstances
Meanwhile Mrs Hall had entered the house Sally was downstairs in the
sittingroom alone and her mother explained to her that Darton had
readily assented to the postponement

No doubt he has said Sally with sad emphasis It is not put off for
a week or a month or a year I shall never marry him and she will



CHAPTER IV


Time passed and the household on the Knap became again serene under the
composing influences of daily routine A desultory very desultory
correspondence dragged on between Sally Hall and Darton who not quite
knowing how to take her petulant words on the night of her brothers
death had continued passive thus long Helena and her children remained
at the dairyhouse almost of necessity and Darton therefore deemed it
advisable to stay away

One day seven months later on when Mr Darton was as usual at his farm
twenty miles from Hintock a note reached him from Helena She thanked
him for his kind offer about her children which her motherinlaw had
duly communicated and stated that she would be glad to accept it as
regarded the eldest the boy Helena had in truth good need to do so
for her uncle had left her penniless and all application to some
relatives in the north had failed There was besides as she said no
good school near Hintock to which she could send the child

On a fine summer day the boy came He was accompanied halfway by Sally
and his motherto the White Horse at Chalk Newtonwhere he was
handed over to Dartons bailiff in a shining springcart who met them
there

He was entered as a dayscholar at a popular school at Casterbridge
three or four miles from Dartons having first been taught by Darton to
ride a forestpony on which he cantered to and from the aforesaid fount
of knowledge and as Darton hoped brought away a promising headful of
the same at each diurnal expedition The thoughtful taciturnity into
which Darton had latterly fallen was quite dissipated by the presence of
this boy

When the Christmas holidays came it was arranged that he should spend
them with his mother The journey was for some reason or other
performed in two stages as at his coming except that Darton in person
took the place of the bailiff and that the boy and himself rode on
horseback

Reaching the renowned White Horse Darton inquired if Miss and young
Mrs Hall were there to meet little Philip as they had agreed to be He
was answered by the appearance of Helena alone at the door

At the last moment Sally would not come she faltered

That meeting practically settled the point towards which these
longsevered persons were converging But nothing was broached about it
for some time yet Sally Hall had in fact imparted the first decisive
motion to events by refusing to accompany Helena She soon gave them a
second move by writing the following note

 Private

 DEAR CHARLESLiving here so long and intimately with Helena I have
 naturally learnt her history especially that of it which refers to
 you I am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time
 and I think you ought to give her the opportunity You inquire in an
 old note if I am sorry that I showed temper which it wasnt that
 night when I heard you talking to her No Charles I am not sorry at
 all for what I said thenYours sincerely SALLY HALL

Thus set in train the transfer of Dartons heart back to its original
quarters proceeded by mere lapse of time In the following July Darton
went to his friend Japheth to ask him at last to fulfil the bridal office
which had been in abeyance since the previous January twelvemonths

With all my heart man o constancy said Dairyman Johns warmly Ive
lost most of my genteel fair complexion haymaking this hot weather tis
true but Ill do your business as well as them that look better There
be scents and good hairoil in the world yet thank God and theyll take
off the roughest o my edge Ill compliment her Better late than
never Sally Hall Ill say

It is not Sally said Darton hurriedly It is young Mrs Hall

Japheths face as soon as he really comprehended became a picture of
reproachful dismay Not Sally he said Why not Sally I cant
believe it Young Mrs Hall Well wellwheres your wisdom

Darton shortly explained particulars but Johns would not be reconciled
She was a woman worth having if ever woman was he cried And now to
let her go

But I suppose I can marry where I like said Darton

Hm replied the dairyman lifting his eyebrows expressively This
dont become you Charlesit really do not If I had done such a thing
you would have sworn I was a curst nothern fool to be drawn off the
scent by such a redherring dollolloll

Farmer Darton responded in such sharp terms to this laconic opinion that
the two friends finally parted in a way they had never parted before
Johns was to be no groomsman to Darton after all He had flatly
declined Darton went off sorry and even unhappy particularly as
Japheth was about to leave that side of the county so that the words
which had divided them were not likely to be explained away or softened
down

A short time after the interview Darton was united to Helena at a simple
matterof fact wedding and she and her little girl joined the boy who
had already grown to look on Dartons house as home

For some months the farmer experienced an unprecedented happiness and
satisfaction There had been a flaw in his life and it was as neatly
mended as was humanly possible But after a season the stream of events
followed less clearly and there were shades in his reveries Helena was
a fragile woman of little staying power physically or morally and
since the time that he had originally known hereight or ten years
beforeshe had been severely tried She had loved herself out in
short and was now occasionally given to moping Sometimes she spoke
regretfully of the gentilities of her early life and instead of
comparing her present state with her condition as the wife of the unlucky
Hall she mused rather on what it had been before she took the first
fatal step of clandestinely marrying him She did not care to please
such people as those with whom she was thrown as a thriving farmers
wife She allowed the pretty trifles of agricultural domesticity to
glide by her as sorry details and had it not been for the children
Dartons house would have seemed but little brighter than it had been
before

This led to occasional unpleasantness until Darton sometimes declared to
himself that such endeavours as his to rectify early deviations of the
heart by harking back to the old point mostly failed of success Perhaps
Johns was right he would say I should have gone on with Sally
Better go with the tide and make the best of its course than stem it at
the risk of a capsize But he kept these unmelodious thoughts to
himself and was outwardly considerate and kind

This somewhat barren tract of his life had extended to less than a year
and a half when his ponderings were cut short by the loss of the woman
they concerned When she was in her grave he thought better of her than
when she had been alive the farm was a worse place without her than with
her after all No woman short of divine could have gone through such an
experience as hers with her first husband without becoming a little
soured Her stagnant sympathies her sometimes unreasonable manner had
covered a heart frank and well meaning and originally hopeful and warm
She left him a tiny red infant in white wrappings To make life as easy
as possible to this touching object became at once his care

As this child learnt to walk and talk Darton learnt to see feasibility in
a scheme which pleased him Revolving the experiment which he had
hitherto made upon life he fancied he had gained wisdom from his
mistakes and caution from his miscarriages

What the scheme was needs no penetration to discover Once more he had
opportunity to recast and rectify his illwrought situations by returning
to Sally Hall who still lived quietly on under her mothers roof at
Hintock Helena had been a woman to lend pathos and refinement to a
home Sally was the woman to brighten it She would not as Helena did
despise the rural simplicities of a farmers fireside Moreover she had
a preeminent qualification for Dartons household no other woman could
make so desirable a mother to her brothers two children and Dartons one
as Sallywhile Darton now that Helena had gone was a more promising
husband for Sally than he had ever been when liable to reminders from an
uncured sentimental wound

Darton was not a man to act rapidly and the working out of his
reparative designs might have been delayed for some time But there came
a winter evening precisely like the one which had darkened over that
former ride to Hintock and he asked himself why he should postpone
longer when the very landscape called for a repetition of that attempt

He told his man to saddle the mare booted and spurred himself with a
younger horsemans nicety kissed the two youngest children and rode
off To make the journey a complete parallel to the first he would fain
have had his old acquaintance Japheth Johns with him But Johns alas
was missing His removal to the other side of the county had left
unrepaired the breach which had arisen between him and Darton and though
Darton had forgiven him a hundred times as Johns had probably forgiven
Darton the effort of reunion in present circumstances was one not likely
to be made

He screwed himself up to as cheerful a pitch as he could without his
former crony and became content with his own thoughts as he rode
instead of the words of a companion The sun went down the boughs
appeared scratched in like an etching against the sky old crooked men
with faggots at their backs said Goodnight sir and Darton replied
Goodnight right heartily

By the time he reached the forking roads it was getting as dark as it had
been on the occasion when Johns climbed the directingpost Darton made
no mistake this time Nor shall I be able to mistake thank Heaven
when I arrive he murmured It gave him peculiar satisfaction to think
that the proposed marriage like his first was of the nature of setting
in order things long awry and not a momentary freak of fancy

Nothing hindered the smoothness of his journey which seemed not half its
former length Though dark it was only between five and six oclock
when the bulky chimneys of Mrs Halls residence appeared in view behind
the sycamoretree On second thoughts he retreated and put up at the ale
house as in former time and when he had plumed himself before the inn
mirror called for something to drink and smoothed out the incipient
wrinkles of care he walked on to the Knap with a quick step



CHAPTER V


That evening Sally was making pinners for the milkers who were now
increased by two for her mother and herself no longer joined in milking
the cows themselves But upon the whole there was little change in the
household economy and not much in its appearance beyond such minor
particulars as that the crack over the window which had been a hundred
years coming was a trifle wider that the beams were a shade blacker
that the influence of modernism had supplanted the open chimney corner by
a grate that Rebekah who had worn a cap when she had plenty of hair
had left it off now she had scarce any because it was reported that caps
were not fashionable and that Sallys face had naturally assumed a more
womanly and experienced cast

Mrs Hall was actually lifting coals with the tongs as she had used to
do

Five years ago this very night if I am not mistaken she said laying
on an ember

Not this very nightthough twas one night this week said the correct
Sally

Well tis near enough Five years ago Mr Darton came to marry you
and my poor boy Phil came home to die She sighed Ah Sally she
presently said if you had managed well Mr Darton would have had you
Helena or none

Dont be sentimental about that mother begged Sally I didnt care
to manage well in such a case Though I liked him I wasnt so anxious
I would never have married the man in the midst of such a hitch as that
was she added with decision and I dont think I would if he were to
ask me now

I am not sure about that unless you have another in your eye

I wouldnt and Ill tell you why I could hardly marry him for love at
this time o day And as weve quite enough to live on if we give up the
dairy tomorrow I should have no need to marry for any meaner reason  
 I am quite happy enough as I am and theres an end of it

Now it was not long after this dialogue that there came a mild rap at the
door and in a moment there entered Rebekah looking as though a ghost
had arrived The fact was that that accomplished skimmer and churner
now a resident in the house had overheard the desultory observations
between mother and daughter and on opening the door to Mr Darton
thought the coincidence must have a grisly meaning in it Mrs Hall
welcomed the farmer with warm surprise as did Sally and for a moment
they rather wanted words

Can you push up the chimneycrook for me Mr Darton the notches hitch
said the matron He did it and the homely little act bridged over the
awkward consciousness that he had been a stranger for four years

Mrs Hall soon saw what he had come for and left the principals together
while she went to prepare him a late tea smiling at Sallys recent hasty
assertions of indifference when she saw how civil Sally was When tea
was ready she joined them She fancied that Darton did not look so
confident as when he had arrived but Sally was quite lighthearted and
the meal passed pleasantly

About seven he took his leave of them Mrs Hall went as far as the door
to light him down the slope On the doorstep he said franklyI came to
ask your daughter to marry me chose the night and everything with an
eye to a favourable answer But she wont

Then shes a very ungrateful girl emphatically said Mrs Hall

Darton paused to shape his sentence and asked II suppose theres
nobody else more favoured

I cant say that there is or that there isnt answered Mrs Hall
Shes private in some things Im on your side however Mr Darton
and Ill talk to her

Thank ee thank ee said the farmer in a gayer accent and with this
assurance the not very satisfactory visit came to an end Darton
descended the roots of the sycamore the light was withdrawn and the
door closed At the bottom of the slope he nearly ran against a man
about to ascend

Can a jackolent believe his few senses on such a dark night or cant
he exclaimed one whose utterance Darton recognized in a moment despite
its unexpectedness I dare not swear he can though I fain would The
speaker was Johns

Darton said he was glad of this opportunity bad as it was of putting an
end to the silence of years and asked the dairyman what he was
travelling that way for

Japheth showed the old jovial confidence in a moment Im going to see
yourrelationsas they always seem to me he saidMrs Hall and
Sally Well Charles the fact is I find the natural barbarousness of
man is much increased by a bachelor life and as your leavings were
always good enough for me Im trying civilization here He nodded
towards the house

Not with Sallyto marry her said Darton feeling something like a
rill of ice water between his shoulders

Yes by the help of Providence and my personal charms And I think I
shall get her I am this road every weekmy present dairy is only four
miles off you know and I see her through the window Tis rather odd
that I was going to speak practical tonight to her for the first time
Youve just called

Yes for a short while But she didnt say a word about you

A good sign a good sign Now that decides me Ill swing the mallet
and get her answer this very night as I planned

A few more remarks and Darton wishing his friend joy of Sally in a
slightly hollow tone of jocularity bade him goodbye Johns promised to
write particulars and ascended and was lost in the shade of the house
and tree A rectangle of light appeared when Johns was admitted and all
was dark again

Happy Japheth said Darton This then is the explanation

He determined to return home that night In a quarter of an hour he
passed out of the village and the next day went about his swedelifting
and storing as if nothing had occurred

He waited and waited to hear from Johns whether the weddingday was
fixed but no letter came He learnt not a single particular till
meeting Johns one day at a horseauction Darton exclaimed
geniallyrather more genially than he feltWhen is the joyful day to
be

To his great surprise a reciprocity of gladness was not conspicuous in
Johns Not at all he said in a very subdued tone Tis a bad job
she wont have me

Darton held his breath till he said with treacherous solicitude Try
againtis coyness

O no said Johns decisively Theres been none of that We talked it
over dozens of times in the most fair and square way She tells me
plainly I dont suit her Twould be simply annoying her to ask her
again Ah Charles you threw a prize away when you let her slip five
years ago

I didI did said Darton

He returned from that auction with a new set of feelings in play He had
certainly made a surprising mistake in thinking Johns his successful
rival It really seemed as if he might hope for Sally after all

This time being rather pressed by business Darton had recourse to pen
andink and wrote her as manly and straightforward a proposal as any
woman could wish to receive The reply came promptly

 DEAR MR DARTONI am as sensible as any woman can be of the
 goodness that leads you to make me this offer a second time Better
 women than I would be proud of the honour for when I read your nice
 long speeches on mangoldwurzel and such like topics at the
 Casterbridge Farmers Club I do feel it an honour I assure you But
 my answer is just the same as before I will not try to explain what
 in truth I cannot explainmy reasons I will simply say that I must
 decline to be married to you With good wishes as in former times I
 am your faithful friend

 SALLY HALL

Darton dropped the letter hopelessly Beyond the negative there was
just a possibility of sarcasm in itnice long speeches on
mangoldwurzel had a suspicious sound However sarcasm or none there
was the answer and he had to be content

He proceeded to seek relief in a business which at this time engrossed
much of his attentionthat of clearing up a curious mistake just current
in the county that he had been nearly ruined by the recent failure of a
local bank A farmer named Darton had lost heavily and the similarity
of name had probably led to the error Belief in it was so persistent
that it demanded several days of letterwriting to set matters straight
and persuade the world that he was as solvent as ever he had been in his
life He had hardly concluded this worrying task when to his delight
another letter arrived in the handwriting of Sally

Darton tore it open it was very short

 DEAR MR DARTONWe have been so alarmed these last few days by the
 report that you were ruined by the stoppage of s Bank that now it
 is contradicted I hasten by my mothers wish to say how truly glad
 we are to find there is no foundation for the report After your
 kindness to my poor brothers children I can do no less than write at
 such a moment We had a letter from each of them a few days agoYour
 faithful friend

 SALLY HALL

Mercenary little woman said Darton to himself with a smile Then
that was the secret of her refusal this timeshe thought I was ruined

Now such was Darton that as hours went on he could not help feeling too
generously towards Sally to condemn her in this What did he want in a
wife he asked himself Love and integrity What next Worldly wisdom
And was there really more than worldly wisdom in her refusal to go aboard
a sinking ship She now knew it was otherwise Begad he said Ill
try her again

The fact was he had so set his heart upon Sally and Sally alone that
nothing was to be allowed to baulk him and his reasoning was purely
formal

Anniversaries having been unpropitious he waited on till a bright day
late in Maya day when all animate nature was fancying in its trusting
foolish way that it was going to bask out of doors for evermore As he
rode through LongAsh Lane it was scarce recognizable as the track of his
two winter journeys No mistake could be made now even with his eyes
shut The cuckoos note was at its best between April tentativeness and
midsummer decrepitude and the reptiles in the sun behaved as winningly
as kittens on a hearth Though afternoon and about the same time as on
the last occasion it was broad day and sunshine when he entered Hintock
and the details of the Knap dairyhouse were visible far up the road He
saw Sally in the garden and was set vibrating He had first intended to
go on to the inn but No he said Ill tie my horse to the garden
gate If all goes well it can soon be taken round if not I mount and
ride away

The tall shade of the horseman darkened the room in which Mrs Hall sat
and made her start for he had ridden by a side path to the top of the
slope where riders seldom came In a few seconds he was in the garden
with Sally

Fiveay three minutesdid the business at the back of that row of
bees Though spring had come and heavenly blue consecrated the scene
Darton succeeded not No said Sally firmly I will never never
marry you Mr Darton I would have done it once but now I never can

Butimplored Mr Darton And with a burst of real eloquence he went
on to declare all sorts of things that he would do for her He would
drive her to see her mother every weektake her to Londonsettle so
much money upon herHeaven knows what he did not promise suggest and
tempt her with But it availed nothing She interposed with a stout
negative which closed the course of his argument like an iron gate
across a highway Darton paused

Then said he simply you hadnt heard of my supposed failure when you
declined last time

I had not she said But if I had twould have been all the same

And tis not because of any soreness from my slighting you years ago

No That soreness is long past

Ahthen you despise me Sally

No she slowly answered I dont altogether despise you I dont
think you quite such a hero as I once didthats all The truth is I
am happy enough as I am and I dont mean to marry at all Now may I
ask a favour sir She spoke with an ineffable charm which whenever
he thought of it made him curse his loss of her as long as he lived

To any extent

Please do not put this question to me any more Friends as long as you
like but lovers and married never

I never will said Darton Not if I live a hundred years

And he never did That he had worn out his welcome in her heart was only
too plain

When his stepchildren had grown up and were placed out in life all
communication between Darton and the Hall family ceased It was only by
chance that years after he learnt that Sally notwithstanding the
solicitations her attractions drew down upon her had refused several
offers of marriage and steadily adhered to her purpose of leading a
single life

THE DISTRACTED PREACHER


CHAPTER IHOW HIS COLD WAS CURED


Something delayed the arrival of the Wesleyan minister and a young man
came temporarily in his stead It was on the thirteenth of January 183
that Mr Stockdale the young man in question made his humble entry into
the village unknown and almost unseen But when those of the
inhabitants who styled themselves of his connection became acquainted
with him they were rather pleased with the substitute than otherwise
though he had scarcely as yet acquired ballast of character sufficient to
steady the consciences of the hundredandforty Methodists of pure blood
who at this time lived in NetherMoynton and to give in addition
supplementary support to the mixed race which went to church in the
morning and chapel in the evening or when there was a teaas many as a
hundredandten people more all told and including the parishclerk in
the wintertime when it was too dark for the vicar to observe who passed
up the street at seven oclockwhich to be just to him he was never
anxious to do

It was owing to this overlapping of creeds that the celebrated population
puzzle arose among the denser gentry of the district around
NetherMoynton how could it be that a parish containing fifteen score of
strong fullgrown Episcopalians and nearly thirteen score of
wellmatured Dissenters numbered barely twoandtwenty score adults in
all

The young man being personally interesting those with whom he came in
contact were content to waive for a while the graver question of his
sufficiency It is said that at this time of his life his eyes were
affectionate though without a ray of levity that his hair was curly
and his figure tall that he was in short a very lovable youth who won
upon his female hearers as soon as they saw and heard him and caused
them to say Why didnt we know of this before he came that we might
have gied him a warmer welcome

The fact was that knowing him to be only provisionally selected and
expecting nothing remarkable in his person or doctrine they and the rest
of his flock in NetherMoynton had felt almost as indifferent about his
advent as if they had been the soundest churchgoing parishioners in the
country and he their true and appointed parson Thus when Stockdale set
foot in the place nobody had secured a lodging for him and though his
journey had given him a bad cold in the head he was forced to attend to
that business himself On inquiry he learnt that the only possible
accommodation in the village would be found at the house of one Mrs
Lizzy Newberry at the upper end of the street

It was a youth who gave this information and Stockdale asked him who
Mrs Newberry might be

The boy said that she was a widowwoman who had got no husband because
he was dead Mr Newberry he added had been a welltodo man enough
as the saying was and a farmer but he had gone off in a decline As
regarded Mrs Newberrys serious side Stockdale gathered that she was
one of the trimmers who went to church and chapel both

Ill go there said Stockdale feeling that in the absence of purely
sectarian lodgings he could do no better

Shes a little particular and wont hae goverment folks or curates
or the pasons friends or such like said the lad dubiously

Ah that may be a promising sign Ill call Or no just you go up and
ask first if she can find room for me I have to see one or two persons
on another matter You will find me down at the carriers

In a quarter of an hour the lad came back and said that Mrs Newberry
would have no objection to accommodate him whereupon Stockdale called at
the house

It stood within a gardenhedge and seemed to be roomy and comfortable
He saw an elderly woman with whom he made arrangements to come the same
night since there was no inn in the place and he wished to house
himself as soon as possible the village being a local centre from which
he was to radiate at once to the different small chapels in the
neighbourhood He forthwith sent his luggage to Mrs Newberrys from the
carriers where he had taken shelter and in the evening walked up to
his temporary home

As he now lived there Stockdale felt it unnecessary to knock at the
door and entering quietly he had the pleasure of hearing footsteps
scudding away like mice into the back quarters He advanced to the
parlour as the front room was called though its stone floor was
scarcely disguised by the carpet which only overlaid the trodden areas
leaving sandy deserts under the bulging mouldings of the tablelegs
playing with brass furniture But the room looked snug and cheerful The
firelight shone out brightly trembling on the knobs and handles and
lurking in great strength on the under surface of the chimneypiece A
deep armchair covered with horsehair and studded with a countless
throng of brass nails was pulled up on one side of the fireplace The
teathings were on the table the teapot cover was open and a little
handbell had been laid at that precise point towards which a person
seated in the great chair might be expected instinctively to stretch his
hand

Stockdale sat down not objecting to his experience of the room thus far
and began his residence by tinkling the bell A little girl crept in at
the summons and made tea for him Her name she said was Marther
Sarer and she lived out there nodding towards the road and village
generally Before Stockdale had got far with his meal a tap sounded on
the door behind him and on his telling the inquirer to come in a rustle
of garments caused him to turn his head He saw before him a fine and
extremely wellmade young woman with dark hair a wide sensible
beautiful forehead eyes that warmed him before he knew it and a mouth
that was in itself a picture to all appreciative souls

Can I get you anything else for tea she said coming forward a step or
two an expression of liveliness on her features and her hand waving the
door by its edge

Nothing thank you said Stockdale thinking less of what he replied
than of what might be her relation to the household

You are quite sure said the young woman apparently aware that he had
not considered his answer

He conscientiously examined the teathings and found them all there
Quite sure Miss Newberry he said

It is Mrs Newberry she said Lizzy Newberry I used to be Lizzy
Simpkins

O I beg your pardon Mrs Newberry And before he had occasion to say
more she left the room

Stockdale remained in some doubt till Martha Sarah came to clear the
table Whose house is this my little woman said he

Mrs Lizzy Newberrys sir

Then Mrs Newberry is not the old lady I saw this afternoon

No Thats Mrs Newberrys mother It was Mrs Newberry who comed in
to you just by now because she wanted to see if you was goodlooking

Later in the evening when Stockdale was about to begin supper she came
again I have come myself Mr Stockdale she said The minister
stood up in acknowledgment of the honour I am afraid little Marther
might not make you understand What will you have for suppertheres
cold rabbit and theres a ham uncut

Stockdale said he could get on nicely with those viands and supper was
laid He had no more than cut a slice when taptap came to the door
again The minister had already learnt that this particular rhythm in
taps denoted the fingers of his enkindling landlady and the doomed young
fellow buried his first mouthful under a look of receptive blandness

We have a chicken in the house Mr StockdaleI quite forgot to mention
it just now Perhaps you would like Marther Sarer to bring it up

Stockdale had advanced far enough in the art of being a young man to say
that he did not want the chicken unless she brought it up herself but
when it was uttered he blushed at the daring gallantry of the speech
perhaps a shade too strong for a serious man and a minister In three
minutes the chicken appeared but to his great surprise only in the
hands of Martha Sarah Stockdale was disappointed which perhaps it was
intended that he should be

He had finished supper and was not in the least anticipating Mrs
Newberry again that night when she tapped and entered as before
Stockdales gratified look told that she had lost nothing by not
appearing when expected It happened that the cold in the head from
which the young man suffered had increased with the approach of night
and before she had spoken he was seized with a violent fit of sneezing
which he could not anyhow repress

Mrs Newberry looked full of pity Your cold is very bad tonight Mr
Stockdale

Stockdale replied that it was rather troublesome

And Ive a good mindshe added archly looking at the cheerless glass
of water on the table which the abstemious minister was going to drink

Yes Mrs Newberry

Ive a good mind that you should have something more likely to cure it
than that cold stuff

Well said Stockdale looking down at the glass as there is no inn
here and nothing better to be got in the village of course it will do

To this she replied There is something better not far off though not
in the house I really think you must try it or you may be ill Yes
Mr Stockdale you shall She held up her finger seeing that he was
about to speak Dont ask what it is wait and you shall see

Lizzy went away and Stockdale waited in a pleasant mood Presently she
returned with her bonnet and cloak on saying I am so sorry but you
must help me to get it Mother has gone to bed Will you wrap yourself
up and come this way and please bring that cup with you

Stockdale a lonely young fellow who had for weeks felt a great craving
for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest and even
tenderness was not sorry to join her and followed his guide through the
back door across the garden to the bottom where the boundary was a
wall This wall was low and beyond it Stockdale discerned in the night
shades several grey headstones and the outlines of the church roof and
tower

It is easy to get up this way she said stepping upon a bank which
abutted on the wall then putting her foot on the top of the stonework
and descending a spring inside where the ground was much higher as is
the manner of graveyards to be Stockdale did the same and followed her
in the dusk across the irregular ground till they came to the tower door
which when they had entered she softly closed behind them

You can keep a secret she said in a musical voice

Like an iron chest said he fervently

Then from under her cloak she produced a small lighted lantern which the
minister had not noticed that she carried at all The light showed them
to be close to the singinggallery stairs under which lay a heap of
lumber of all sorts but consisting mostly of decayed framework pews
panels and pieces of flooring that from time to time had been removed
from their original fixings in the body of the edifice and replaced by
new

Perhaps you will drag some of those boards aside she said holding the
lantern over her head to light him better Or will you take the lantern
while I move them

I can manage it said the young man and acting as she ordered he
uncovered to his surprise a row of little barrels bound with wood
hoops each barrel being about as large as the nave of a heavy waggon
wheel

When they were laid open Lizzy fixed her eyes on him as if she wondered
what he would say

You know what they are she asked finding that he did not speak

Yes barrels said Stockdale simply He was an inland man the son of
highly respectable parents and brought up with a single eye to the
ministry and the sight suggested nothing beyond the fact that such
articles were there

You are quite right they are barrels she said in an emphatic tone of
candour that was not without a touch of irony

Stockdale looked at her with an eye of sudden misgiving Not smugglers
liquor he said

Yes said she They are tubs of spirit that have accidentally come
over in the dark from France

In NetherMoynton and its vicinity at this date people always smiled at
the sort of sin called in the outside world illicit trading and these
little kegs of gin and brandy were as well known to the inhabitants as
turnips So that Stockdales innocent ignorance and his look of alarm
when he guessed the sinister mystery seemed to strike Lizzy first as
ludicrous and then as very awkward for the good impression that she
wished to produce upon him

Smuggling is carried on here by some of the people she said in a
gentle apologetic voice It has been their practice for generations
and they think it no harm Now will you roll out one of the tubs

What to do with it said the minister

To draw a little from it to cure your cold she answered It is so
nation strong that it drives away that sort of thing in a jiffy O it
is all right about our taking it I may have what I like the owner of
the tubs says so I ought to have had some in the house and then I
shouldnt ha been put to this trouble but I drink none myself and so I
often forget to keep it indoors

You are allowed to help yourself I suppose that you may not inform
where their hidingplace is

Well no not that particularly but I may take any if I want it So
help yourself

I will to oblige you since you have a right to it murmured the
minister and though he was not quite satisfied with his part in the
performance he rolled one of the tubs out from the corner into the
middle of the tower floor How do you wish me to get it outwith a
gimlet I suppose

No Ill show you said his interesting companion and she held up with
her other hand a shoemakers awl and a hammer You must never do these
things with a gimlet because the wooddust gets in and when the buyers
pour out the brandy that would tell them that the tub had been broached
An awl makes no dust and the hole nearly closes up again Now tap one
of the hoops forward

Stockdale took the hammer and did so

Now make the hole in the part that was covered by the hoop

He made the hole as directed It wont run out he said

O yes it will said she Take the tub between your knees and squeeze
the heads and Ill hold the cup

Stockdale obeyed and the pressure taking effect upon the tub which
seemed to be thin the spirit spirted out in a stream When the cup was
full he ceased pressing and the flow immediately stopped Now we must
fill up the keg with water said Lizzy or it will cluck like forty
hens when it is handled and show that tis not full

But they tell you you may take it

Yes the smugglers but the buyers must not know that the smugglers have
been kind to me at their expense

I see said Stockdale doubtfully I much question the honesty of this
proceeding

By her direction he held the tub with the hole upwards and while he went
through the process of alternately pressing and ceasing to press she
produced a bottle of water from which she took mouthfuls conveying each
to the keg by putting her pretty lips to the hole where it was sucked in
at each recovery of the cask from pressure When it was again full he
plugged the hole knocked the hoop down to its place and buried the tub
in the lumber as before

Arent the smugglers afraid that you will tell he asked as they
recrossed the churchyard

O no they are not afraid of that I couldnt do such a thing

They have put you into a very awkward corner said Stockdale
emphatically You must of course as an honest person sometimes feel
that it is your duty to informreally you must

Well I have never particularly felt it as a duty and besides my
first husband She stopped and there was some confusion in her voice
Stockdale was so honest and unsophisticated that he did not at once
discern why she paused but at last he did perceive that the words were a
slip and that no woman would have uttered first husband by accident
unless she had thought pretty frequently of a second He felt for her
confusion and allowed her time to recover and proceed My husband
she said in a selfcorrected tone used to know of their doings and so
did my father and kept the secret I cannot inform in fact against
anybody

I see the hardness of it he continued like a man who looked far into
the moral of things And it is very cruel that you should be tossed and
tantalized between your memories and your conscience I do hope Mrs
Newberry that you will soon see your way out of this unpleasant
position

Well I dont just now she murmured

By this time they had passed over the wall and entered the house where
she brought him a glass and hot water and left him to his own
reflections He looked after her vanishing form asking himself whether
he as a respectable man and a minister and a shining light even
though as yet only of the halfpennycandle sort were quite justified in
doing this thing A sneeze settled the question and he found that when
the fiery liquor was lowered by the addition of twice or thrice the
quantity of water it was one of the prettiest cures for a cold in the
head that he had ever known particularly at this chilly time of the
year

Stockdale sat in the deep chair about twenty minutes sipping and
meditating till he at length took warmer views of things and longed for
the morrow when he would see Mrs Newberry again He then felt that
though chronologically at a short distance it would in an emotional
sense be very long before tomorrow came and walked restlessly round the
room His eye was attracted by a framed and glazed sampler in which a
running ornament of firtrees and peacocks surrounded the following
pretty bit of sentiment

 Roseleaves smell when roses thrive
 Heres my work while Im alive
 Roseleaves smell when shrunk and shed
 Heres my work when I am dead

 Lizzy Simpkins Fear God Honour the King

 Aged 11 years

Tis hers he said to himself Heavens how I like that name

Before he had done thinking that no other name from Abigail to Zenobia
would have suited his young landlady so well taptap came again upon the
door and the minister started as her face appeared yet another time
looking so disinterested that the most ingenious would have refrained
from asserting that she had come to affect his feelings by her seductive
eyes

Would you like a fire in your room Mr Stockdale on account of your
cold

The minister being still a little pricked in the conscience for
countenancing her in watering the spirits saw here a way to
selfchastisement No I thank you he said firmly it is not
necessary I have never been used to one in my life and it would be
giving way to luxury too far

Then I wont insist she said and disconcerted him by vanishing
instantly

Wondering if she was vexed by his refusal he wished that he had chosen
to have a fire even though it should have scorched him out of bed and
endangered his selfdiscipline for a dozen days However he consoled
himself with what was in truth a rare consolation for a budding lover
that he was under the same roof with Lizzy her guest in fact to take a
poetical view of the term lodger and that he would certainly see her on
the morrow

The morrow came and Stockdale rose early his cold quite gone He had
never in his life so longed for the breakfast hour as he did that day
and punctually at eight oclock after a short walk to reconnoitre the
premises he reentered the door of his dwelling Breakfast passed and
Martha Sarah attended but nobody came voluntarily as on the night before
to inquire if there were other wants which he had not mentioned and
which she would attempt to gratify He was disappointed and went out
hoping to see her at dinner Dinner time came he sat down to the meal
finished it lingered on for a whole hour although two new teachers were
at that moment waiting at the chapeldoor to speak to him by appointment
It was useless to wait longer and he slowly went his way down the lane
cheered by the thought that after all he would see her in the evening
and perhaps engage again in the delightful tubbroaching in the
neighbouring church tower which proceeding he resolved to render more
moral by steadfastly insisting that no water should be introduced to fill
up though the tub should cluck like all the hens in Christendom But
nothing could disguise the fact that it was a queer business and his
countenance fell when he thought how much more his mind was interested in
that matter than in his serious duties

However compunction vanished with the decline of day Night came and
his tea and supper but no Lizzy Newberry and no sweet temptations At
last the minister could bear it no longer and said to his quaint little
attendant Where is Mrs Newberry today judiciously handing a penny
as he spoke

Shes busy said Martha

Anything serious happened he asked handing another penny and
revealing yet additional pennies in the background

O nonothing at all said she with breathless confidence Nothing
ever happens to her Shes only biding upstairs in bed because tis her
way sometimes

Being a young man of some honour he would not question further and
assuming that Lizzy must have a bad headache or other slight ailment in
spite of what the girl had said he went to bed dissatisfied not even
setting eyes on old Mrs Simpkins I said last night that I should see
her tomorrow he reflected but that was not to be

Next day he had better fortune or worse meeting her at the foot of the
stairs in the morning and being favoured by a visit or two from her
during the dayonce for the purpose of making kindly inquiries about his
comfort as on the first evening and at another time to place a bunch of
winterviolets on his table with a promise to renew them when they
drooped On these occasions there was something in her smile which
showed how conscious she was of the effect she produced though it must
be said that it was rather a humorous than a designing consciousness and
savoured more of pride than of vanity

As for Stockdale he clearly perceived that he possessed unlimited
capacity for backsliding and wished that tutelary saints were not denied
to Dissenters He set a watch upon his tongue and eyes for the space of
one hour and a half after which he found it was useless to struggle
further and gave himself up to the situation The other minister will
be here in a month he said to himself when sitting over the fire Then
I shall be off and she will distract my mind no more    And then
shall I go on living by myself for ever No when my two years of
probation are finished I shall have a furnished house to live in with a
varnished door and a brass knocker and Ill march straight back to her
and ask her flat as soon as the last plate is on the dresser

Thus a titillating fortnight was passed by young Stockdale during which
time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever since the
beginning of history He saw the object of attachment several times one
day did not see her at all the next met her when he least expected to
do so missed her when hints and signs as to where she should be at a
given hour almost amounted to an appointment This mild coquetry was
perhaps fair enough under the circumstances of their being so closely
lodged and Stockdale put up with it as philosophically as he was able
Being in her own house she could after vexing him or disappointing him
of her presence easily win him back by suddenly surrounding him with
those little attentions which her position as his landlady put it in her
power to bestow When he had waited indoors half the day to see her and
on finding that she would not be seen had gone off in a huff to the
dreariest and dampest walk he could discover she would restore
equilibrium in the evening with Mr Stockdale I have fancied you must
feel draught o nights from your bedroom window and so I have been
putting up thicker curtains this afternoon while you were out or I
noticed that you sneezed twice again this morning Mr Stockdale Depend
upon it that cold is hanging about you yet I am sure it isI have
thought of it continually and you must let me make a posset for you

Sometimes in coming home he found his sittingroom rearranged chairs
placed where the table had stood and the table ornamented with the few
fresh flowers and leaves that could be obtained at this season so as to
add a novelty to the room At times she would be standing on a chair
outside the house trying to nail up a branch of the monthly rose which
the winter wind had blown down and of course he stepped forward to
assist her when their hands got mixed in passing the shreds and nails
Thus they became friends again after a disagreement She would utter on
these occasions some pretty and deprecatory remark on the necessity of
her troubling him anew and he would straightway say that he would do a
hundred times as much for her if she should so require



CHAPTER IIHOW HE SAW TWO OTHER MEN


Matters being in this advancing state Stockdale was rather surprised one
cloudy evening while sitting in his room at hearing her speak in low
tones of expostulation to some one at the door It was nearly dark but
the shutters were not yet closed nor the candles lighted and Stockdale
was tempted to stretch his head towards the window He saw outside the
door a young man in clothes of a whitish colour and upon reflection
judged their wearer to be the wellbuilt and rather handsome miller who
lived below The millers voice was alternately low and firm and
sometimes it reached the level of positive entreaty but what the words
were Stockdale could in no way hear

Before the colloquy had ended the ministers attention was attracted by
a second incident Opposite Lizzys home grew a clump of laurels
forming a thick and permanent shade One of the laurel boughs now
quivered against the light background of sky and in a moment the head of
a man peered out and remained still He seemed to be also much
interested in the conversation at the door and was plainly lingering
there to watch and listen Had Stockdale stood in any other relation to
Lizzy than that of a lover he might have gone out and investigated the
meaning of this but being as yet but an unprivileged ally he did
nothing more than stand up and show himself against the firelight
whereupon the listener disappeared and Lizzy and the miller spoke in
lower tones

Stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance that as soon as the
miller was gone he said Mrs Newberry are you aware that you were
watched just now and your conversation heard

When she said

When you were talking to that miller A man was looking from the laurel
tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you

She showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand and he
added Perhaps you were talking of things you did not wish to be
overheard

I was talking only on business she said

Lizzy be frank said the young man If it was only on business why
should anybody wish to listen to you

She looked curiously at him What else do you think it could be then

Wellthe only talk between a young woman and man that is likely to
amuse an eavesdropper

Ah yes she said smiling in spite of her preoccupation Well my
cousin Owlett has spoken to me about matrimony every now and then
thats true but he was not speaking of it then I wish he had been
speaking of it with all my heart It would have been much less serious
for me

O Mrs Newberry

It would Not that I should ha chimed in with him of course I wish
it for other reasons I am glad Mr Stockdale that you have told me of
that listener It is a timely warning and I must see my cousin again

But dont go away till I have spoken said the minister Ill out
with it at once and make no more ado Let it be Yes or No between us
Lizzy please do And he held out his hand in which she freely allowed
her own to rest but without speaking

You mean Yes by that he asked after waiting a while

You may be my sweetheart if you will

Why not say at once you will wait for me until I have a house and can
come back to marry you

Because I am thinkingthinking of something else she said with
embarrassment It all comes upon me at once and I must settle one
thing at a time

At any rate dear Lizzy you can assure me that the miller shall not be
allowed to speak to you except on business You have never directly
encouraged him

She parried the question by saying You see he and his party have been
in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes and as I have
not denied him it makes him rather forward

Thingswhat things

Tubsthey are called Things here

But why dont you deny him my dear Lizzy

I cannot well

You are too timid It is unfair of him to impose so upon you and get
your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks Promise me that the
next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will let me roll them into
the street

She shook her head I would not venture to offend the neighbours so
much as that said she or do anything that would be so likely to put
poor Owlett into the hands of the excisemen

Stockdale sighed and said that he thought hers a mistaken generosity
when it extended to assisting those who cheated the king of his dues At
any rate you will let me make him keep his distance as your lover and
tell him flatly that you are not for him

Please not at present she said I dont wish to offend my old
neighbours It is not only Owlett who is concerned

This is too bad said Stockdale impatiently

On my honour I wont encourage him as my lover Lizzy answered
earnestly A reasonable man will be satisfied with that

Well so I am said Stockdale his countenance clearing



CHAPTER IIITHE MYSTERIOUS GREATCOAT


Stockdale now began to notice more particularly a feature in the life of
his fair landlady which he had casually observed but scarcely ever
thought of before It was that she was markedly irregular in her hours
of rising For a week or two she would be tolerably punctual reaching
the groundfloor within a few minutes of halfpast seven Then suddenly
she would not be visible till twelve at noon perhaps for three or four
days in succession and twice he had certain proof that she did not leave
her room till halfpast three in the afternoon The second time that
this extreme lateness came under his notice was on a day when he had
particularly wished to consult with her about his future movements and
he concluded as he always had done that she had a cold headache or
other ailment unless she had kept herself invisible to avoid meeting and
talking to him which he could hardly believe The former supposition
was disproved however by her innocently saying some days later when
they were speaking on a question of health that she had never had a
moments heaviness headache or illness of any kind since the previous
January twelvemonth

I am glad to hear it said he I thought quite otherwise

What do I look sickly she asked turning up her face to show the
impossibility of his gazing on it and holding such a belief for a moment

Not at all I merely thought so from your being sometimes obliged to
keep your room through the best part of the day

O as for thatit means nothing she murmured with a look which some
might have called cold and which was the worst look that he liked to see
upon her It is pure sleepiness Mr Stockdale

Never

It is I tell you When I stay in my room till halfpast three in the
afternoon you may always be sure that I slept soundly till three or I
shouldnt have stayed there

It is dreadful said Stockdale thinking of the disastrous effects of
such indulgence upon the household of a minister should it become a
habit of everyday occurrence

But then she said divining his good and prescient thoughts it only
happens when I stay awake all night I dont go to sleep till five or
six in the morning sometimes

Ah thats another matter said Stockdale Sleeplessness to such an
alarming extent is real illness Have you spoken to a doctor

O nothere is no need for doing thatit is all natural to me And
she went away without further remark

Stockdale might have waited a long time to know the real cause of her
sleeplessness had it not happened that one dark night he was sitting in
his bedroom jotting down notes for a sermon which occupied him
perfunctorily for a considerable time after the other members of the
household had retired He did not get to bed till one oclock Before
he had fallen asleep he heard a knocking at the front door first rather
timidly performed and then louder Nobody answered it and the person
knocked again As the house still remained undisturbed Stockdale got
out of bed went to his window which overlooked the door and opening
it asked who was there

A young womans voice replied that Susan Wallis was there and that she
had come to ask if Mrs Newberry could give her some mustard to make a
plaster with as her father was taken very ill on the chest

The minister having neither bell nor servant was compelled to act in
person I will call Mrs Newberry he said Partly dressing himself
he went along the passage and tapped at Lizzys door She did not
answer and thinking of her erratic habits in the matter of sleep he
thumped the door persistently when he discovered by its moving ajar
under his knocking that it had only been gently pushed to As there was
now a sufficient entry for the voice he knocked no longer but said in
firm tones Mrs Newberry you are wanted

The room was quite silent not a breathing not a rustle came from any
part of it Stockdale now sent a positive shout through the open space
of the door Mrs Newberrystill no answer or movement of any kind
within Then he heard sounds from the opposite room that of Lizzys
mother as if she had been aroused by his uproar though Lizzy had not
and was dressing herself hastily Stockdale softly closed the younger
womans door and went on to the other which was opened by Mrs Simpkins
before he could reach it She was in her ordinary clothes and had a
light in her hand

Whats the person calling about she said in alarm

Stockdale told the girls errand adding seriously I cannot wake Mrs
Newberry

It is no matter said her mother I can let the girl have what she
wants as well as my daughter And she came out of the room and went
downstairs

Stockdale retired towards his own apartment saying however to Mrs
Simpkins from the landing as if on second thoughts I suppose there is
nothing the matter with Mrs Newberry that I could not wake her

O no said the old lady hastily Nothing at all

Still the minister was not satisfied Will you go in and see he said
I should be much more at ease

Mrs Simpkins returned up the staircase went to her daughters room and
came out again almost instantly There is nothing at all the matter
with Lizzy she said and descended again to attend to the applicant
who having seen the light had remained quiet during this interval

Stockdale went into his room and lay down as before He heard Lizzys
mother open the front door admit the girl and then the murmured
discourse of both as they went to the storecupboard for the medicament
required The girl departed the door was fastened Mrs Simpkins came
upstairs and the house was again in silence Still the minister did not
fall asleep He could not get rid of a singular suspicion which was all
the more harassing in being if true the most unaccountable thing within
his experience That Lizzy Newberry was in her bedroom when he made such
a clamour at the door he could not possibly convince himself
notwithstanding that he had heard her come upstairs at the usual time go
into her chamber and shut herself up in the usual way Yet all reason
was so much against her being elsewhere that he was constrained to go
back again to the unlikely theory of a heavy sleep though he had heard
neither breath nor movement during a shouting and knocking loud enough to
rouse the Seven Sleepers

Before coming to any positive conclusion he fell asleep himself and did
not awake till day He saw nothing of Mrs Newberry in the morning
before he went out to meet the rising sun as he liked to do when the
weather was fine but as this was by no means unusual he took no notice
of it At breakfasttime he knew that she was not far off by hearing her
in the kitchen and though he saw nothing of her person that back
apartment being rigorously closed against his eyes she seemed to be
talking ordering and bustling about among the pots and skimmers in so
ordinary a manner that there was no reason for his wasting more time in
fruitless surmise

The minister suffered from these distractions and his extemporized
sermons were not improved thereby Already he often said Romans for
Corinthians in the pulpit and gave out hymns in strange cramped metres
that hitherto had always been skipped because the congregation could not
raise a tune to fit them He fully resolved that as soon as his few
weeks of stay approached their end he would cut the matter short and
commit himself by proposing a definite engagement repenting at leisure
if necessary

With this end in view he suggested to her on the evening after her
mysterious sleep that they should take a walk together just before dark
the latter part of the proposition being introduced that they might
return home unseen She consented to go and away they went over a
stile to a shrouded footpath suited for the occasion But in spite of
attempts on both sides they were unable to infuse much spirit into the
ramble She looked rather paler than usual and sometimes turned her
head away

Lizzy said Stockdale reproachfully when they had walked in silence a
long distance

Yes said she

You yawnedmuch my company is to you He put it in that way but he
was really wondering whether her yawn could possibly have more to do with
physical weariness from the night before than mental weariness of that
present moment Lizzy apologized and owned that she was rather tired
which gave him an opening for a direct question on the point but his
modesty would not allow him to put it to her and he uncomfortably
resolved to wait

The month of February passed with alternations of mud and frost rain and
sleet east winds and northwesterly gales The hollow places in the
ploughed fields showed themselves as pools of water which had settled
there from the higher levels and had not yet found time to soak away
The birds began to get lively and a single thrush came just before
sunset each evening and sang hopefully on the large elmtree which stood
nearest to Mrs Newberrys house Cold blasts and brittle earth had
given place to an oozing dampness more unpleasant in itself than frost
but it suggested coming spring and its unpleasantness was of a bearable
kind

Stockdale had been going to bring about a practical understanding with
Lizzy at least halfadozen times but what with the mystery of her
apparent absence on the night of the neighbours call and her curious
way of lying in bed at unaccountable times he felt a check within him
whenever he wanted to speak out Thus they still lived on as
indefinitely affianced lovers each of whom hardly acknowledged the
others claim to the name of chosen one Stockdale persuaded himself
that his hesitation was owing to the postponement of the ordained
ministers arrival and the consequent delay in his own departure which
did away with all necessity for haste in his courtship but perhaps it
was only that his discretion was reasserting itself and telling him that
he had better get clearer ideas of Lizzy before arranging for the grand
contract of his life with her She on her part always seemed ready to
be urged further on that question than he had hitherto attempted to go
but she was none the less independent and to a degree which would have
kept from flagging the passion of a far more mutable man

On the evening of the first of March he went casually into his bedroom
about dusk and noticed lying on a chair a greatcoat hat and breeches
Having no recollection of leaving any clothes of his own in that spot he
went and examined them as well as he could in the twilight and found
that they did not belong to him He paused for a moment to consider how
they might have got there He was the only man living in the house and
yet these were not his garments unless he had made a mistake No they
were not his He called up Martha Sarah

How did these things come in my room he said flinging the
objectionable articles to the floor

Martha said that Mrs Newberry had given them to her to brush and that
she had brought them up there thinking they must be Mr Stockdales as
there was no other gentleman alodging there

Of course you did said Stockdale Now take them down to your
misess and say they are some clothes I have found here and know nothing
about

As the door was left open he heard the conversation downstairs How
stupid said Mrs Newberry in a tone of confusion Why Marther
Sarer I did not tell you to take em to Mr Stockdales room

I thought they must be his as they was so muddy said Martha humbly

You should have left em on the clotheshorse said the young mistress
severely and she came upstairs with the garments on her arm quickly
passed Stockdales room and threw them forcibly into a closet at the end
of a passage With this the incident ended and the house was silent
again

There would have been nothing remarkable in finding such clothes in a
widows house had they been clean or motheaten or creased or mouldy
from long lying by but that they should be splashed with recent mud
bothered Stockdale a good deal When a young pastor is in the aspen
stage of attachment and open to agitation at the merest trifles a
really substantial incongruity of this complexion is a disturbing thing
However nothing further occurred at that time but he became watchful
and given to conjecture and was unable to forget the circumstance

One morning on looking from his window he saw Mrs Newberry herself
brushing the tails of a long drab greatcoat which if he mistook not
was the very same garment as the one that had adorned the chair of his
room It was densely splashed up to the hollow of the back with
neighbouring NetherMoynton mud to judge by its colour the spots being
distinctly visible to him in the sunlight The previous day or two
having been wet the inference was irresistible that the wearer had quite
recently been walking some considerable distance about the lanes and
fields Stockdale opened the window and looked out and Mrs Newberry
turned her head Her face became slowly red she never had looked
prettier or more incomprehensible he waved his hand affectionately and
said goodmorning she answered with embarrassment having ceased her
occupation on the instant that she saw him and rolled up the coat half
cleaned

Stockdale shut the window Some simple explanation of her proceeding was
doubtless within the bounds of possibility but he himself could not
think of one and he wished that she had placed the matter beyond
conjecture by voluntarily saying something about it there and then

But though Lizzy had not offered an explanation at the moment the
subject was brought forward by her at the next time of their meeting She
was chatting to him concerning some other event and remarked that it
happened about the time when she was dusting some old clothes that had
belonged to her poor husband

You keep them clean out of respect to his memory said Stockdale
tentatively

I air and dust them sometimes she said with the most charming
innocence in the world

Do dead men come out of their graves and walk in mud murmured the
minister in a cold sweat at the deception that she was practising

What did you say asked Lizzy

Nothing nothing said he mournfully Mere wordsa phrase that will
do for my sermon next Sunday It was too plain that Lizzy was unaware
that he had seen actual pedestrian splashes upon the skirts of the tell
tale overcoat and that she imagined him to believe it had come direct
from some chest or drawer

The aspect of the case was now considerably darker Stockdale was so
much depressed by it that he did not challenge her explanation or
threaten to go off as a missionary to benighted islanders or reproach
her in any way whatever He simply parted from her when she had done
talking and lived on in perplexity till by degrees his natural manner
became sad and constrained



CHAPTER IVAT THE TIME OF THE NEW MOON


The following Thursday was changeable damp and gloomy and the night
threatened to be windy and unpleasant Stockdale had gone away to
Knollsea in the morning to be present at some commemoration service
there and on his return he was met by the attractive Lizzy in the
passage Whether influenced by the tide of cheerfulness which had
attended him that day or by the drive through the open air or whether
from a natural disposition to let bygones alone he allowed himself to be
fascinated into forgetfulness of the greatcoat incident and upon the
whole passed a pleasant evening not so much in her society as within
sound of her voice as she sat talking in the back parlour to her mother
till the latter went to bed Shortly after this Mrs Newberry retired
and then Stockdale prepared to go upstairs himself But before he left
the room he remained standing by the dying embers awhile thinking long
of one thing and another and was only aroused by the flickering of his
candle in the socket as it suddenly declined and went out Knowing that
there were a tinderbox matches and another candle in his bedroom he
felt his way upstairs without a light On reaching his chamber he laid
his hand on every possible ledge and corner for the tinderbox but for a
long time in vain Discovering it at length Stockdale produced a spark
and was kindling the brimstone when he fancied that he heard a movement
in the passage He blew harder at the lint the match flared up and
looking by aid of the blue light through the door which had been
standing open all this time he was surprised to see a male figure
vanishing round the top of the staircase with the evident intention of
escaping unobserved The personage wore the clothes which Lizzy had been
brushing and something in the outline and gait suggested to the minister
that the wearer was Lizzy herself

But he was not sure of this and greatly excited Stockdale determined
to investigate the mystery and to adopt his own way for doing it He
blew out the match without lighting the candle went into the passage
and proceeded on tiptoe towards Lizzys room A faint grey square of
light in the direction of the chamberwindow as he approached told him
that the door was open and at once suggested that the occupant was gone
He turned and brought down his fist upon the handrail of the staircase
It was she in her late husbands coat and hat

Somewhat relieved to find that there was no intruder in the case yet
none the less surprised the minister crept down the stairs softly put
on his boots overcoat and hat and tried the front door It was
fastened as usual he went to the back door found this unlocked and
emerged into the garden The night was mild and moonless and rain had
lately been falling though for the present it had ceased There was a
sudden dropping from the trees and bushes every now and then as each
passing wind shook their boughs Among these sounds Stockdale heard the
faint fall of feet upon the road outside and he guessed from the step
that it was Lizzys He followed the sound and helped by the
circumstance of the wind blowing from the direction in which the
pedestrian moved he got nearly close to her and kept there without
risk of being overheard While he thus followed her up the street or
lane as it might indifferently be called there being more hedge than
houses on either side a figure came forward to her from one of the
cottage doors Lizzy stopped the minister stepped upon the grass and
stopped also

Is that Mrs Newberry said the man who had come out whose voice
Stockdale recognized as that of one of the most devout members of his
congregation

It is said Lizzy

I be quite readyIve been here this quarterhour

Ah John said she I have bad news there is danger tonight for our
venture

And dye tell ot I dreamed there might be

Yes she said hurriedly and you must go at once round to where the
chaps are waiting and tell them they will not be wanted till tomorrow
night at the same time I go to burn the lugger off

I will he said and instantly went off through a gate Lizzy
continuing her way

On she tripped at a quickening pace till the lane turned into the
turnpikeroad which she crossed and got into the track for Ringsworth
Here she ascended the hill without the least hesitation passed the
lonely hamlet of Holworth and went down the vale on the other side
Stockdale had never taken any extensive walks in this direction but he
was aware that if she persisted in her course much longer she would draw
near to the coast which was here between two and three miles distant
from NetherMoynton and as it had been about a quarterpast eleven
oclock when they set out her intention seemed to be to reach the shore
about midnight

Lizzy soon ascended a small mound which Stockdale at the same time
adroitly skirted on the left and a dull monotonous roar burst upon his
ear The hillock was about fifty yards from the top of the cliffs and
by day it apparently commanded a full view of the bay There was light
enough in the sky to show her disguised figure against it when she
reached the top where she paused and afterwards sat down Stockdale
not wishing on any account to alarm her at this moment yet desirous of
being near her sank upon his hands and knees crept a little higher up
and there stayed still

The wind was chilly the ground damp and his position one in which he
did not care to remain long However before he had decided to leave it
the young man heard voices behind him What they signified he did not
know but fearing that Lizzy was in danger he was about to run forward
and warn her that she might be seen when she crept to the shelter of a
little bush which maintained a precarious existence in that exposed spot
and her form was absorbed in its dark and stunted outline as if she had
become part of it She had evidently heard the men as well as he They
passed near him talking in loud and careless tones which could be heard
above the uninterrupted washings of the sea and which suggested that
they were not engaged in any business at their own risk This proved to
be the fact some of their words floated across to him and caused him to
forget at once the coldness of his situation

Whats the vessel

A lugger about fifty tons

From Cherbourg I suppose

Yes a blieve

But it dont all belong to Owlett

O no Hes only got a share Theres another or two in ita farmer
and such like but the names I dont know

The voices died away and the heads and shoulders of the men diminished
towards the cliff and dropped out of sight

My darling has been tempted to buy a share by that unbeliever Owlett
groaned the minister his honest affection for Lizzy having quickened to
its intensest point during these moments of risk to her person and name
Thats why shes here he said to himself O it will be the ruin of
her

His perturbation was interrupted by the sudden bursting out of a bright
and increasing light from the spot where Lizzy was in hiding A few
seconds later and before it had reached the height of a blaze he heard
her rush past him down the hollow like a stone from a sling in the
direction of home The light now flared high and wide and showed its
position clearly She had kindled a bough of furze and stuck it into the
bush under which she had been crouching the wind fanned the flame which
crackled fiercely and threatened to consume the bush as well as the
bough Stockdale paused just long enough to notice thus much and then
followed rapidly the route taken by the young woman His intention was
to overtake her and reveal himself as a friend but run as he would he
could see nothing of her Thus he flew across the open country about
Holworth twisting his legs and ankles in unexpected fissures and
descents till on coming to the gate between the downs and the road he
was forced to pause to get breath There was no audible movement either
in front or behind him and he now concluded that she had not outrun him
but that hearing him at her heels and believing him one of the excise
party she had hidden herself somewhere on the way and let him pass by

He went on at a more leisurely pace towards the village On reaching the
house he found his surmise to be correct for the gate was on the latch
and the door unfastened just as he had left them Stockdale closed the
door behind him and waited silently in the passage In about ten
minutes he heard the same light footstep that he had heard in going out
it paused at the gate which opened and shut softly and then the door
latch was lifted and Lizzy came in

Stockdale went forward and said at once Lizzy dont be frightened I
have been waiting up for you

She started though she had recognized the voice It is Mr Stockdale
isnt it she said

Yes he answered becoming angry now that she was safe indoors and not
alarmed And a nice game Ive found you out in tonight You are in
mans clothes and I am ashamed of you

Lizzy could hardly find a voice to answer this unexpected reproach

I am only partly in mans clothes she faltered shrinking back to the
wall It is only his greatcoat and hat and breeches that Ive got on
which is no harm as he was my own husband and I do it only because a
cloak blows about so and you cant use your arms I have got my own
dress under just the sameit is only tucked in Will you go away
upstairs and let me pass I didnt want you to see me at such a time as
this

But I have a right to see you How do you think there can be anything
between us now Lizzy was silent You are a smuggler he continued
sadly

I have only a share in the run she said

That makes no difference Whatever did you engage in such a trade as
that for and keep it such a secret from me all this time

I dont do it always I only do it in wintertime when tis new moon

Well I suppose thats because it cant be done anywhen else    You
have regularly upset me Lizzy

I am sorry for that Lizzy meekly replied

Well now said he more tenderly no harm is done as yet Wont you
for the sake of me give up this blamable and dangerous practice
altogether

I must do my best to save this run said she getting rather husky in
the throat I dont want to give you upyou know that but I dont
want to lose my venture I dont know what to do now Why I have kept
it so secret from you is that I was afraid you would be angry if you
knew

I should think so I suppose if I had married you without finding this
out youd have gone on with it just the same

I dont know I did not think so far ahead I only went tonight to
burn the folks off because we found that the excisemen knew where the
tubs were to be landed

It is a pretty mess to be in altogether is this said the distracted
young minister Well what will you do now

Lizzy slowly murmured the particulars of their plan the chief of which
were that they meant to try their luck at some other point of the shore
the next night that three landingplaces were always agreed upon before
the run was attempted with the understanding that if the vessel was
burnt off from the first point which was Ringsworth as it had been by
her tonight the crew should attempt to make the second which was
Lulstead Cove on the second night and if there too danger threatened
they should on the third night try the third place which was behind a
headland further west

Suppose the officers hinder them landing there too he said his
attention to this interesting programme displacing for a moment his
concern at her share in it

Then we shant try anywhere else all this darkthats what we call the
time between moon and moonand perhaps theyll string the tubs to a
strayline and sink em a littleways from shore and take the bearings
and then when they have a chance theyll go to creep for em

Whats that

O theyll go out in a boat and drag a creeperthats a grapnelalong
the bottom till it catch hold of the strayline

The minister stood thinking and there was no sound within doors but the
tick of the clock on the stairs and the quick breathing of Lizzy partly
from her walk and partly from agitation as she stood close to the wall
not in such complete darkness but that he could discern against its
whitewashed surface the greatcoat and broad hat which covered her

Lizzy all this is very wrong he said Dont you remember the lesson
of the tributemoney Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars
Surely you have heard that read times enough in your growing up

Hes dead she pouted

But the spirit of the text is in force just the same

My father did it and so did my grandfather and almost everybody in
NetherMoynton lives by it and life would be so dull if it wasnt for
that that I should not care to live at all

I am nothing to live for of course he replied bitterly You would
not think it worth while to give up this wild business and live for me
alone

I have never looked at it like that

And you wont promise and wait till I am ready

I cannot give you my word tonight And looking thoughtfully down
she gradually moved and moved away going into the adjoining room and
closing the door between them She remained there in the dark till he
was tired of waiting and had gone up to his own chamber

Poor Stockdale was dreadfully depressed all the next day by the
discoveries of the night before Lizzy was unmistakably a fascinating
young woman but as a ministers wife she was hardly to be contemplated
If I had only stuck to fathers little grocery business instead of
going in for the ministry she would have suited me beautifully he said
sadly until he remembered that in that case he would never have come
from his distant home to NetherMoynton and never have known her

The estrangement between them was not complete but it was sufficient to
keep them out of each others company Once during the day he met her in
the gardenpath and said turning a reproachful eye upon her Do you
promise Lizzy But she did not reply The evening drew on and he
knew well enough that Lizzy would repeat her excursion at nighther half
offended manner had shown that she had not the slightest intention of
altering her plans at present He did not wish to repeat his own share
of the adventure but act as he would his uneasiness on her account
increased with the decline of day Supposing that an accident should
befall her he would never forgive himself for not being there to help
much as he disliked the idea of seeming to countenance such unlawful
escapades



CHAPTER VHOW THEY WENT TO LULSTEAD COVE


As he had expected she left the house at the same hour at night this
time passing his door without stealth as if she knew very well that he
would be watching and were resolved to brave his displeasure He was
quite ready opened the door quickly and reached the back door almost as
soon as she

Then you will go Lizzy he said as he stood on the step beside her
who now again appeared as a little man with a face altogether unsuited to
his clothes

I must she said repressed by his stern manner

Then I shall go too said he

And I am sure you will enjoy it she exclaimed in more buoyant tones
Everybody does who tries it

God forbid that I should he said But I must look after you

They opened the wicket and went up the road abreast of each other but at
some distance apart scarcely a word passing between them The evening
was rather less favourable to smuggling enterprise than the last had
been the wind being lower and the sky somewhat clear towards the north

It is rather lighter said Stockdale

Tis unfortunately said she But it is only from those few stars
over there The moon was new today at four oclock and I expected
clouds I hope we shall be able to do it this dark for when we have to
sink em for long it makes the stuff taste bleachy and folks dont like
it so well

Her course was different from that of the preceding night branching off
to the left over Lords Barrow as soon as they had got out of the lane
and crossed the highway By the time they reached Chaldon Down
Stockdale who had been in perplexed thought as to what he should say to
her decided that he would not attempt expostulation now while she was
excited by the adventure but wait till it was over and endeavour to
keep her from such practices in future It occurred to him once or
twice as they rambled on that should they be surprised by the
excisemen his situation would be more awkward than hers for it would be
difficult to prove his true motive in coming to the spot but the risk
was a slight consideration beside his wish to be with her

They now arrived at a ravine which lay on the outskirts of Chaldon a
village two miles on their way towards the point of the shore they
sought Lizzy broke the silence this time I have to wait here to meet
the carriers I dont know if they have come yet As I told you we go
to Lulstead Cove tonight and it is two miles further than Ringsworth

It turned out that the men had already come for while she spoke two or
three dozen heads broke the line of the slope and a company of them at
once descended from the bushes where they had been lying in wait These
carriers were men whom Lizzy and other proprietors regularly employed to
bring the tubs from the boat to a hidingplace inland They were all
young fellows of NetherMoynton Chaldon and the neighbourhood quiet
and inoffensive persons who simply engaged to carry the cargo for Lizzy
and her cousin Owlett as they would have engaged in any other labour for
which they were fairly well paid

At a word from her they closed in together You had better take it
now she said to them and handed to each a packet It contained six
shillings their remuneration for the nights undertaking which was paid
beforehand without reference to success or failure but besides this
they had the privilege of selling as agents when the run was successfully
made As soon as it was done she said to them The place is the old
one near Lulstead Cove the men till that moment not having been told
whither they were bound for obvious reasons Owlett will meet you
there added Lizzy I shall follow behind to see that we are not
watched

The carriers went on and Stockdale and Mrs Newberry followed at a
distance of a stones throw What do these men do by day he said

Twelve or fourteen of them are labouring men Some are brickmakers
some carpenters some shoemakers some thatchers They are all known to
me very well Nine of em are of your own congregation

I cant help that said Stockdale

O I know you cant I only told you The others are more
churchinclined because they supply the pason with all the spirits he
requires and they dont wish to show unfriendliness to a customer

How do you choose em said Stockdale

We choose em for their closeness and because they are strong and
surefooted and able to carry a heavy load a long way without being
tired

Stockdale sighed as she enumerated each particular for it proved how far
involved in the business a woman must be who was so well acquainted with
its conditions and needs And yet he felt more tenderly towards her at
this moment than he had felt all the foregoing day Perhaps it was that
her experienced manner and hold indifference stirred his admiration in
spite of himself

Take my arm Lizzy he murmured

I dont want it she said Besides we may never be to each other
again what we once have been

That depends upon you said he and they went on again as before

The hired carriers paced along over Chaldon Down with as little
hesitation as if it had been day avoiding the cartway and leaving the
village of East Chaldon on the left so as to reach the crest of the hill
at a lonely trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called
Round Pound An hours brisk walking brought them within sound of the
sea not many hundred yards from Lulstead Cove Here they paused and
Lizzy and Stockdale came up with them when they went on together to the
verge of the cliff One of the men now produced an iron bar which he
drove firmly into the soil a yard from the edge and attached to it a
rope that he had uncoiled from his body They all began to descend
partly stepping partly sliding down the incline as the rope slipped
through their hands

You will not go to the bottom Lizzy said Stockdale anxiously

No I stay here to watch she said Owlett is down there

The men remained quite silent when they reached the shore and the next
thing audible to the two at the top was the dip of heavy oars and the
dashing of waves against a boats bow In a moment the keel gently
touched the shingle and Stockdale heard the footsteps of the thirtysix
carriers running forwards over the pebbles towards the point of landing

There was a sousing in the water as of a brood of ducks plunging in
showing that the men had not been particular about keeping their legs or
even their waists dry from the brine but it was impossible to see what
they were doing and in a few minutes the shingle was trampled again The
iron bar sustaining the rope on which Stockdales hand rested began to
swerve a little and the carriers one by one appeared climbing up the
sloping cliff dripping audibly as they came and sustaining themselves
by the guiderope Each man on reaching the top was seen to be carrying
a pair of tubs one on his back and one on his chest the two being slung
together by cords passing round the chine hoops and resting on the
carriers shoulders Some of the stronger men carried three by putting
an extra one on the top behind but the customary load was a pair these
being quite weighty enough to give their bearer the sensation of having
chest and backbone in contact after a walk of four or five miles

Where is Owlett said Lizzy to one of them

He will not come up this way said the carrier Hes to bide on shore
till we be safe off Then without waiting for the rest the foremost
men plunged across the down and when the last had ascended Lizzy
pulled up the rope wound it round her arm wriggled the bar from the
sod and turned to follow the carriers

You are very anxious about Owletts safety said the minister

Was there ever such a man said Lizzy Why isnt he my cousin

Yes Well it is a bad nights work said Stockdale heavily But
Ill carry the bar and rope for you

Thank God the tubs have got so far all right said she

Stockdale shook his head and taking the bar walked by her side towards
the downs and the moan of the sea was heard no more

Is this what you meant the other day when you spoke of having business
with Owlett the young man asked

This is it she replied I never see him on any other matter

A partnership of that kind with a young man is very odd

It was begun by my father and his who were brotherlaws

Her companion could not blind himself to the fact that where tastes and
pursuits were so akin as Lizzys and Owletts and where risks were
shared as with them in every undertaking there would be a peculiar
appropriateness in her answering Owletts standing question on matrimony
in the affirmative This did not soothe Stockdale its tendency being
rather to stimulate in him an effort to make the pair as inappropriate as
possible and win her away from this nocturnal crew to correctness of
conduct and a ministers parlour in some farremoved inland county

They had been walking near enough to the file of carriers for Stockdale
to perceive that when they got into the road to the village they split
up into two companies of unequal size each of which made off in a
direction of its own One company the smaller of the two went towards
the church and by the time that Lizzy and Stockdale reached their own
house these men had scaled the churchyard wall and were proceeding
noiselessly over the grass within

I see that Owlett has arranged for one batch to be put in the church
again observed Lizzy Do you remember my taking you there the first
night you came

Yes of course said Stockdale No wonder you had permission to
broach the tubsthey were his I suppose

No they were notthey were mine I had permission from myself The
day after that they went several miles inland in a waggonload of manure
and sold very well

At this moment the group of men who had made off to the left some time
before began leaping one by one from the hedge opposite Lizzys house
and the first man who had no tubs upon his shoulders came forward

Mrs Newberry isnt it he said hastily

Yes Jim said she Whats the matter

I find that we cant put any in Badgers Clump tonight Lizzy said
Owlett The place is watched We must sling the appletree in the
orchet if theres time We cant put any more under the church lumber
than I have sent on there and my mixen hev already more in en than is
safe

Very well she said Be quick about itthats all What can I do

Nothing at all please Ah it is the ministeryou two that cant do
anything had better get indoors and not be zeed

While Owlett thus conversed in a tone so full of contraband anxiety and
so free from lovers jealousy the men who followed him had been
descending one by one from the hedge and it unfortunately happened that
when the hindmost took his leap the cord slipped which sustained his
tubs the result was that both the kegs fell into the road one of them
being stove in by the blow

Od drown it all said Owlett rushing back

It is worth a good deal I suppose said Stockdale

O noabout two guineas and half to us now said Lizzy excitedly It
isnt thatit is the smell It is so blazing strong before it has been
lowered by water that it smells dreadfully when spilt in the road like
that I do hope Latimer wont pass by till it is gone off

Owlett and one or two others picked up the burst tub and began to scrape
and trample over the spot to disperse the liquor as much as possible
and then they all entered the gate of Owletts orchard which adjoined
Lizzys garden on the right Stockdale did not care to follow them for
several on recognizing him had looked wonderingly at his presence though
they said nothing Lizzy left his side and went to the bottom of the
garden looking over the hedge into the orchard where the men could be
dimly seen bustling about and apparently hiding the tubs All was done
noiselessly and without a light and when it was over they dispersed in
different directions those who had taken their cargoes to the church
having already gone off to their homes

Lizzy returned to the gardengate over which Stockdale was still
abstractedly leaning It is all finished I am going indoors now she
said gently I will leave the door ajar for you

O noyou neednt said Stockdale I am coming too

But before either of them had moved the faint clatter of horses hoofs
broke upon the ear and it seemed to come from the point where the track
across the down joined the hard road

They are just too late cried Lizzy exultingly

Who said Stockdale

Latimer the ridingofficer and some assistant of his We had better
go indoors

They entered the house and Lizzy bolted the door Please dont get a
light Mr Stockdale she said

Of course I will not said he

I thought you might be on the side of the king said Lizzy with
faintest sarcasm

I am said Stockdale But Lizzy Newberry I love you and you know
it perfectly well and you ought to know if you do not what I have
suffered in my conscience on your account these last few days

I guess very well she said hurriedly Yet I dont see why Ah you
are better than I

The trotting of the horses seemed to have again died away and the pair
of listeners touched each others fingers in the cold Goodnight of
those whom something seriously divided They were on the landing but
before they had taken three steps apart the tramp of the horsemen
suddenly revived almost close to the house Lizzy turned to the
staircase window opened the casement about an inch and put her face
close to the aperture Yes one of em is Latimer she whispered He
always rides a white horse One would think it was the last colour for a
man in that line

Stockdale looked and saw the white shape of the animal as it passed by
but before the riders had gone another ten yards Latimer reined in his
horse and said something to his companion which neither Stockdale nor
Lizzy could hear Its drift was however soon made evident for the
other man stopped also and sharply turning the horses heads they
cautiously retraced their steps When they were again opposite Mrs
Newberrys garden Latimer dismounted and the man on the dark horse did
the same

Lizzy and Stockdale intently listening and observing the proceedings
naturally put their heads as close as possible to the slit formed by the
slightly opened casement and thus it occurred that at last their cheeks
came positively into contact They went on listening as if they did not
know of the singular incident which had happened to their faces and the
pressure of each to each rather increased than lessened with the lapse of
time

They could hear the excisemen sniffing the air like hounds as they paced
slowly along When they reached the spot where the tub had burst both
stopped on the instant

Ay ay tis quite strong here said the second officer Shall we
knock at the door

Well no said Latimer Maybe this is only a trick to put us off the
scent They wouldnt kick up this stink anywhere near their
hidingplace I have known such things before

Anyhow the things or some of em must have been brought this way
said the other

Yes said Latimer musingly Unless tis all done to tole us the wrong
way I have a mind that we go home for tonight without saying a word
and come the first thing in the morning with more hands I know they
have storages about here but we can do nothing by this owls light We
will look round the parish and see if everybody is in bed John and if
all is quiet we will do as I say

They went on and the two inside the window could hear them passing
leisurely through the whole village the street of which curved round at
the bottom and entered the turnpike road at another junction This way
the excisemen followed and the amble of their horses died quite away

What will you do said Stockdale withdrawing from his position

She knew that he alluded to the coming search by the officers to divert
her attention from their own tender incident by the casement which he
wished to be passed over as a thing rather dreamt of than done O
nothing she replied with as much coolness as she could command under
her disappointment at his manner We often have such storms as this
You would not be frightened if you knew what fools they are Fancy
riding o horseback through the place of course they will hear and see
nobody while they make that noise but they are always afraid to get off
in case some of our fellows should burst out upon em and tie them up to
the gatepost as they have done before now Goodnight Mr Stockdale

She closed the window and went to her room where a tear fell from her
eyes and that not because of the alertness of the ridingofficers



CHAPTER VITHE GREAT SEARCH AT NETHERMOYNTON


Stockdale was so excited by the events of the evening and the dilemma
that he was placed in between conscience and love that he did not sleep
or even doze but remained as broadly awake as at noonday As soon as
the grey light began to touch ever so faintly the whiter objects in his
bedroom he arose dressed himself and went downstairs into the road

The village was already astir Several of the carriers had heard the
wellknown tramp of Latimers horse while they were undressing in the
dark that night and had already communicated with each other and Owlett
on the subject The only doubt seemed to be about the safety of those
tubs which had been left under the church gallerystairs and after a
short discussion at the corner of the mill it was agreed that these
should be removed before it got lighter and hidden in the middle of a
double hedge bordering the adjoining field However before anything
could be carried into effect the footsteps of many men were heard coming
down the lane from the highway

Damn it here they be said Owlett who having already drawn the hatch
and started his mill for the day stood stolidly at the milldoor covered
with flour as if the interest of his whole soul was bound up in the
shaking walls around him

The two or three with whom he had been talking dispersed to their usual
work and when the excise officers and the formidable body of men they
had hired reached the village cross between the mill and Mrs
Newberrys house the village wore the natural aspect of a place
beginning its morning labours

Now said Latimer to his associates who numbered thirteen men in all
what I know is that the things are somewhere in this here place We
have got the day before us and tis hard if we cant light upon em and
get em to Budmouth Customhouse before night First we will try the
fuelhouses and then well work our way into the chimmers and then to
the ricks and stables and so creep round You have nothing but your
noses to guide ye mind so use em today if you never did in your lives
before

Then the search began Owlett during the early part watched from his
millwindow Lizzy from the door of her house with the greatest self
possession A farmer down below who also had a share in the run rode
about with one eye on his fields and the other on Latimer and his
myrmidons prepared to put them off the scent if he should be asked a
question Stockdale who was no smuggler at all felt more anxiety than
the worst of them and went about his studies with a heavy heart coming
frequently to the door to ask Lizzy some question or other on the
consequences to her of the tubs being found

The consequences she said quietly are simply that I shall lose em
As I have none in the house or garden they cant touch me personally

But you have some in the orchard

Owlett rents that of me and he lends it to others So it will be hard
to say who put any tubs there if they should be found

There was never such a tremendous sniffing known as that which took place
in NetherMoynton parish and its vicinity this day All was done
methodically and mostly on hands and knees At different hours of the
day they had different plans From daybreak to breakfasttime the
officers used their sense of smell in a direct and straightforward manner
only pausing nowhere but at such places as the tubs might be supposed to
be secreted in at that very moment pending their removal on the
following night Among the places tested and examined were

Hollow trees Cupboards Culverts
Potatograves Clockcases Hedgerows
Fuelhouses Chimneyflues Faggotricks
Bedrooms Rainwaterbutts Haystacks
Applelofts Pigsties Coppers and ovens

After breakfast they recommenced with renewed vigour taking a new line
that is to say directing their attention to clothes that might be
supposed to have come in contact with the tubs in their removal from the
shore such garments being usually tainted with the spirit owing to its
oozing between the staves They now sniffed at 

Smockfrocks Smiths and shoemakers aprons
Old shirts and waistcoats Kneenaps and hedginggloves
Coats and hats Tarpaulins
Breeches and leggings Marketcloaks
Womens shawls and gowns Scarecrows

And as soon as the midday meal was over they pushed their search into
places where the spirits might have been thrown away in alarm

Horseponds Mixens Sinks in yards
Stabledrains Wet ditches Roadscrapings and
Cinderheaps Cesspools Backdoor gutters

But still these indefatigable excisemen discovered nothing more than the
original telltale smell in the road opposite Lizzys house which even
yet had not passed off

Ill tell ye what it is men said Latimer about three oclock in the
afternoon we must begin over again Find them tubs I will

The men who had been hired for the day looked at their hands and knees
muddy with creeping on all fours so frequently and rubbed their noses
as if they had almost had enough of it for the quantity of bad air which
had passed into each ones nostril had rendered it nearly as insensible
as a flue However after a moments hesitation they prepared to start
anew except three whose power of smell had quite succumbed under the
excessive wear and tear of the day

By this time not a male villager was to be seen in the parish Owlett
was not at his mill the farmers were not in their fields the parson was
not in his garden the smith had left his forge and the wheelwrights
shop was silent

Where the divil are the folk gone said Latimer waking up to the fact
of their absence and looking round Ill have em up for this Why
dont they come and help us Theres not a man about the place but the
Methodist parson and hes an old woman I demand assistance in the
kings name

We must find the jineral public afore we can demand that said his
lieutenant

Well well we shall do better without em said Latimer who changed
his moods at a moments notice But theres great cause of suspicion in
this silence and this keeping out of sight and Ill bear it in mind Now
we will go across to Owletts orchard and see what we can find there

Stockdale who heard this discussion from the gardengate over which he
had been leaning was rather alarmed and thought it a mistake of the
villagers to keep so completely out of the way He himself like the
excisemen had been wondering for the last halfhour what could have
become of them Some labourers were of necessity engaged in distant
fields but the masterworkmen should have been at home though one and
all after just showing themselves at their shops had apparently gone
off for the day He went in to Lizzy who sat at a back window sewing
and said Lizzy where are the men

Lizzy laughed Where they mostly are when theyre run so hard as this
She cast her eyes to heaven Up there she said

Stockdale looked up Whaton the top of the church tower he asked
seeing the direction of her glance

Yes

Well I expect they will soon have to come down said he gravely I
have been listening to the officers and they are going to search the
orchard over again and then every nook in the church

Lizzy looked alarmed for the first time Will you go and tell our
folk she said They ought to be let know Seeing his conscience
struggling within him like a boiling pot she added No never mind
Ill go myself

She went out descended the garden and climbed over the churchyard wall
at the same time that the preventivemen were ascending the road to the
orchard Stockdale could do no less than follow her By the time that
she reached the tower entrance he was at her side and they entered
together

NetherMoynton churchtower was as in many villages without a turret
and the only way to the top was by going up to the singers gallery and
thence ascending by a ladder to a square trapdoor in the floor of the
bellloft above which a permanent ladder was fixed passing through the
bells to a hole in the roof When Lizzy and Stockdale reached the
gallery and looked up nothing but the trapdoor and the five holes for
the bellropes appeared The ladder was gone

Theres no getting up said Stockdale

O yes there is said she Theres an eye looking at us at this
moment through a knothole in that trapdoor

And as she spoke the trap opened and the dark line of the ladder was
seen descending against the whitewashed wall When it touched the
bottom Lizzy dragged it to its place and said If youll go up Ill
follow

The young man ascended and presently found himself among consecrated
bells for the first time in his life nonconformity having been in the
Stockdale blood for some generations He eyed them uneasily and looked
round for Lizzy Owlett stood here holding the top of the ladder

What be you really one of us said the miller

It seems so said Stockdale sadly

Hes not said Lizzy who overheard Hes neither for nor against us
Hell do us no harm

She stepped up beside them and then they went on to the next stage
which when they had clambered over the dusty bellcarriages was of easy
ascent leading towards the hole through which the pale sky appeared and
into the open air Owlett remained behind for a moment to pull up the
lower ladder

Keep down your heads said a voice as soon as they set foot on the
flat

Stockdale here beheld all the missing parishioners lying on their
stomachs on the tower roof except a few who elevated on their hands and
knees were peeping through the embrasures of the parapet Stockdale did
the same and saw the village lying like a map below him over which
moved the figures of the excisemen each foreshortened to a crablike
object the crown of his hat forming a circular disc in the centre of
him Some of the men had turned their heads when the young preachers
figure arose among them

What Mr Stockdale said Matt Grey in a tone of surprise

Id as lief that it hadnt been said Jim Clarke If the pason
should see him a trespassing here in his tower twould be none the
better for we seeing how a do hate chapelmembers Hed never buy a
tub of us again and hes as good a customer as we have got this side o
Warmll

Where is the pason said Lizzy

In his house to be sure that he mid see nothing of whats going
onwhere all good folks ought to be and this young man likewise

Well he has brought some news said Lizzy They are going to search
the orchet and church can we do anything if they should find

Yes said her cousin Owlett Thats what weve been talking o and
we have settled our line Well be dazed

The exclamation was caused by his perceiving that some of the searchers
having got into the orchard and begun stooping and creeping hither and
thither were pausing in the middle where a tree smaller than the rest
was growing They drew closer and bent lower than ever upon the ground

O my tubs said Lizzy faintly as she peered through the parapet at
them

They have got em a blieve said Owlett

The interest in the movements of the officers was so keen that not a
single eye was looking in any other direction but at that moment a shout
from the church beneath them attracted the attention of the smugglers as
it did also of the party in the orchard who sprang to their feet and
went towards the churchyard wall At the same time those of the
Government men who had entered the church unperceived by the smugglers
cried aloud Here be some of em at last

The smugglers remained in a blank silence uncertain whether some of
em meant tubs or men but again peeping cautiously over the edge of the
tower they learnt that tubs were the things descried and soon these
fated articles were brought one by one into the middle of the churchyard
from their hidingplace under the gallerystairs

They are going to put em on Hintons vault till they find the rest
said Lizzy hopelessly The excisemen had in fact begun to pile up the
tubs on a large stone slab which was fixed there and when all were
brought out from the tower two or three of the men were left standing by
them the rest of the party again proceeding to the orchard

The interest of the smugglers in the next manoeuvres of their enemies
became painfully intense Only about thirty tubs had been secreted in
the lumber of the tower but seventy were hidden in the orchard making
up all that they had brought ashore as yet the remainder of the cargo
having been tied to a sinker and dropped overboard for another nights
operations The excisemen having reentered the orchard acted as if
they were positive that here lay hidden the rest of the tubs which they
were determined to find before nightfall They spread themselves out
round the field and advancing on all fours as before went anew round
every appletree in the enclosure The young tree in the middle again
led them to pause and at length the whole company gathered there in a
way which signified that a second chain of reasoning had led to the same
results as the first

When they had examined the sod hereabouts for some minutes one of the
men rose ran to a disused porch of the church where tools were kept and
returned with the sextons pickaxe and shovel with which they set to
work

Are they really buried there said the minister for the grass was so
green and uninjured that it was difficult to believe it had been
disturbed The smugglers were too interested to reply and presently
they saw to their chagrin the officers stand several on each side of
the tree and stooping and applying their hands to the soil they bodily
lifted the tree and the turf around it The appletree now showed itself
to be growing in a shallow box with handles for lifting at each of the
four sides Under the site of the tree a square hole was revealed and
an exciseman went and looked down

It is all up now said Owlett quietly And now all of ye get down
before they notice we are here and be ready for our next move I had
better bide here till dark or they may take me on suspicion as tis on
my ground Ill be with ye as soon as daylight begins to pink in

And I said Lizzy

You please look to the linchpins and screws then go indoors and know
nothing at all The chaps will do the rest

The ladder was replaced and all but Owlett descended the men passing
off one by one at the back of the church and vanishing on their
respective errands

Lizzy walked boldly along the street followed closely by the minister

You are going indoors Mrs Newberry he said

She knew from the words Mrs Newberry that the division between them
had widened yet another degree

I am not going home she said I have a little thing to do before I
go in Martha Sarah will get your tea

O I dont mean on that account said Stockdale What can you have to
do further in this unhallowed affair

Only a little she said

What is that Ill go with you

No I shall go by myself Will you please go indoors I shall be there
in less than an hour

You are not going to run any danger Lizzy said the young man his
tenderness reasserting itself

None whateverworth mentioning answered she and went down towards
the Cross

Stockdale entered the garden gate and stood behind it looking on The
excisemen were still busy in the orchard and at last he was tempted to
enter and watch their proceedings When he came closer he found that
the secret cellar of whose existence he had been totally unaware was
formed by timbers placed across from side to side about a foot under the
ground and grassed over

The excisemen looked up at Stockdales fair and downy countenance and
evidently thinking him above suspicion went on with their work again As
soon as all the tubs were taken out they began tearing up the turf
pulling out the timbers and breaking in the sides till the cellar was
wholly dismantled and shapeless the appletree lying with its roots high
to the air But the hole which had in its time held so much contraband
merchandize was never completely filled up either then or afterwards a
depression in the greensward marking the spot to this day



CHAPTER VIITHE WALK TO WARMELL CROSS AND AFTERWARDS


As the goods had all to be carried to Budmouth that night the
excisemens next object was to find horses and carts for the journey and
they went about the village for that purpose Latimer strode hither and
thither with a lump of chalk in his hand marking broadarrows so
vigorously on every vehicle and set of harness that he came across that
it seemed as if he would chalk broadarrows on the very hedges and roads
The owner of every conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for
Government purposes Stockdale who had had enough of the scene turned
indoors thoughtful and depressed Lizzy was already there having come
in at the back though she had not yet taken off her bonnet She looked
tired and her mood was not much brighter than his own They had but
little to say to each other and the minister went away and attempted to
read but at this he could not succeed and he shook the little bell for
tea

Lizzy herself brought in the tray the girl having run off into the
village during the afternoon too full of excitement at the proceedings
to remember her state of life However almost before the sad lovers had
said anything to each other Martha came in in a steaming state

O theres such a stoor Mrs Newberry and Mr Stockdale The kings
excisemen cant get the carts ready nohow at all They pulled Thomas
Ballams and William Rogerss and Stephen Sprakes carts into the road
and off came the wheels and down fell the carts and they found there
was no linchpins in the arms and then they tried Samuel Shanes waggon
and found that the screws were gone from he and at last they looked at
the dairymans cart and hes got none neither They have gone now to
the blacksmiths to get some made but hes nowhere to be found

Stockdale looked at Lizzy who blushed very slightly and went out of the
room followed by Martha Sarah But before they had got through the
passage there was a rap at the front door and Stockdale recognized
Latimers voice addressing Mrs Newberry who had turned back

For Gods sake Mrs Newberry have you seen Hardman the blacksmith up
this way If we could get hold of him wed een amost drag him by the
hair of his head to his anvil where he ought to be

Hes an idle man Mr Latimer said Lizzy archly What do you want
him for

Why there isnt a horse in the place that has got more than three shoes
on and some have only two The waggonwheels be without strakes and
theres no linchpins to the carts What with that and the bother about
every set of harness being out of order we shant be off before
nightfallupon my soul we shant Tis a rough lot Mrs Newberry that
youve got about you here but theyll play at this game once too often
mark my words they will Theres not a man in the parish that dont
deserve to be whipped

It happened that Hardman was at that moment a little further up the lane
smoking his pipe behind a hollybush When Latimer had done speaking he
went on in this direction and Hardman hearing the excisemans steps
found curiosity too strong for prudence He peeped out from the bush at
the very moment that Latimers glance was on it There was nothing left
for him to do but to come forward with unconcern

Ive been looking for you for the last hour said Latimer with a glare
in his eye

Sorry to hear that said Hardman Ive been out for a stroll to look
for more hid tubs to deliver em up to Goverment

O yes Hardman we know it said Latimer with withering sarcasm We
know that youll deliver em up to Goverment We know that all the
parish is helping us and have been all day Now you please walk along
with me down to your shop and kindly let me hire ye in the kings name

They went down the lane together and presently there resounded from the
smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung However the carts
and horses were got into some sort of travelling condition but it was
not until after the clock had struck six when the muddy roads were
glistening under the horizontal light of the fading day The smuggled
tubs were soon packed into the vehicles and Latimer with three of his
assistants drove slowly out of the village in the direction of the port
of Budmouth some considerable number of miles distant the other
excisemen being left to watch for the remainder of the cargo which they
knew to have been sunk somewhere between Ringsworth and Lulstead Cove
and to unearth Owlett the only person clearly implicated by the
discovery of the cave

Women and children stood at the doors as the carts each chalked with the
Government pitchfork passed in the increasing twilight and as they
stood they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy
expression that told only too plainly the relation which they bore to the
trade

Well Lizzy said Stockdale when the crackle of the wheels had nearly
died away This is a fit finish to your adventure I am truly thankful
that you have got off without suspicion and the loss only of the liquor
Will you sit down and let me talk to you

By and by she said But I must go out now

Not to that horrid shore again he said blankly

No not there I am only going to see the end of this days business

He did not answer to this and she moved towards the door slowly as if
waiting for him to say something more

You dont offer to come with me she added at last I suppose thats
because you hate me after all this

Can you say it Lizzy when you know I only want to save you from such
practices Come with you of course I will if it is only to take care of
you But why will you go out again

Because I cannot rest indoors Something is happening and I must know
what Now come And they went into the dusk together

When they reached the turnpikeroad she turned to the right and he soon
perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen and
their load He had given her his arm and every now and then she
suddenly pulled it back to signify that he was to halt a moment and
listen They had walked rather quickly along the first quarter of a
mile and on the second or third time of standing still she said I hear
them aheaddont you

Yes he said I hear the wheels But what of that

I only want to know if they get clear away from the neighbourhood

Ah said he a light breaking upon him Something desperate is to be
attemptedand now I remember there was not a man about the village when
we left

Hark she murmured The noise of the cartwheels had stopped and given
place to another sort of sound

Tis a scuffle said Stockdale Therell be murder Lizzy let go my
arm I am going on On my conscience I must not stay here and do
nothing

Therell be no murder and not even a broken head she said Our men
are thirty to four of them no harm will be done at all

Then there is an attack exclaimed Stockdale and you knew it was to
be Why should you side with men who break the laws like this

Why should you side with men who take from country traders what they
have honestly bought wi their own money in France said she firmly

They are not honestly bought said he

They are she contradicted I and Owlett and the others paid thirty
shillings for every one of the tubs before they were put on board at
Cherbourg and if a king who is nothing to us sends his people to steal
our property we have a right to steal it back again

Stockdale did not stop to argue the matter but went quickly in the
direction of the noise Lizzy keeping at his side Dont you interfere
will you dear Richard she said anxiously as they drew near Dont
let us go any closer tis at Warmell Cross where they are seizing em
You can do no good and you may meet with a hard blow

Let us see first what is going on he said But before they had got
much further the noise of the cartwheels began again and Stockdale soon
found that they were coming towards him In another minute the three
carts came up and Stockdale and Lizzy stood in the ditch to let them
pass

Instead of being conducted by four men as had happened when they went
out of the village the horses and carts were now accompanied by a body
of from twenty to thirty all of whom as Stockdale perceived to his
astonishment had blackened faces Among them walked six or eight huge
female figures whom from their wide strides Stockdale guessed to be
men in disguise As soon as the party discerned Lizzy and her companion
four or five fell back and when the carts had passed came close to the
pair

There is no walking up this way for the present said one of the gaunt
women who wore curls a foot long dangling down the sides of her face
in the fashion of the time Stockdale recognized this ladys voice as
Owletts

Why not said Stockdale This is the public highway

Now look here youngster said Owlett O tis the Methodist
parsonwhat and Mrs Newberry Well youd better not go up that way
Lizzy Theyve all run off and folks have got their own again

The miller then hastened on and joined his comrades Stockdale and Lizzy
also turned back I wish all this hadnt been forced upon us she said
regretfully But if those excisemen had got off with the tubs half the
people in the parish would have been in want for the next month or two

Stockdale was not paying much attention to her words and he said I
dont think I can go back like this Those four poor excisemen may be
murdered for all I know

Murdered said Lizzy impatiently We dont do murder here

Well I shall go as far as Warmell Cross to see said Stockdale
decisively and without wishing her safe home or anything else the
minister turned back Lizzy stood looking at him till his form was
absorbed in the shades and then with sadness she went in the direction
of NetherMoynton

The road was lonely and after nightfall at this time of the year there
was often not a passer for hours Stockdale pursued his way without
hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps and in due time he
passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded the Warmell
Crossroad Before he had reached the point of intersection he heard
voices from the thicket

Hoihoihoi Help help

The voices were not at all feeble or despairing but they were
unmistakably anxious Stockdale had no weapon and before plunging into
the pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge
to use in case of need When he got among the trees he shoutedWhats
the matterwhere are you

Here answered the voices and pushing through the brambles in that
direction he came near the objects of his search

Why dont you come forward said Stockdale

We be tied to the trees

Who are you

Poor Will Latimer the exciseman said one plaintively Just come and
cut these cords theres a good man We were afraid nobody would pass by
tonight

Stockdale soon loosened them upon which they stretched their limbs and
stood at their ease

The rascals said Latimer getting now into a rage though he had
seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up Tis the same set of
fellows I know they were Moynton chaps to a man

But we cant swear to em said another Not one of em spoke

What are you going to do said Stockdale

Id fain go back to Moynton and have at em again said Latimer

So would we said his comrades

Fight till we die said Latimer

We will we will said his men

But said Latimer more frigidly as they came out of the plantation
we dont know that these chaps with black faces were Moynton men And
proof is a hard thing

So it is said the rest

And therefore we wont do nothing at all said Latimer with complete
dispassionateness For my part Id sooner be them than we The
clitches of my arms are burning like fire from the cords those two
strapping women tied round em My opinion is now I have had time to
think ot that you may serve your Goverment at too high a price For
these two nights and days I have not had an hours rest and please God
heres for homealong

The other officers agreed heartily to this course and thanking
Stockdale for his timely assistance they parted from him at the Cross
taking themselves the western road and Stockdale going back to Nether
Moynton

During that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful
kind As soon as he got into the house and before entering his own
rooms he advanced to the door of the little back parlour in which Lizzy
usually sat with her mother He found her there alone Stockdale went
forward and like a man in a dream looked down upon the table that
stood between him and the young woman who had her bonnet and cloak still
on As he did not speak she looked up from her chair at him with
misgiving in her eye

Where are they gone he then said listlessly

WhoI dont know I have seen nothing of them since I came straight
in here

If your men can manage to get off with those tubs it will be a great
profit to you I suppose

A share will be mine a share my cousin Owletts a share to each of the
two farmers and a share divided amongst the men who helped us

And you still think he went on slowly that you will not give this
business up

Lizzy rose and put her hand upon his shoulder Dont ask that she
whispered You dont know what you are asking I must tell you though
I meant not to do it What I make by that trade is all I have to keep my
mother and myself with

He was astonished I did not dream of such a thing he said I would
rather have swept the streets had I been you What is money compared
with a clear conscience

My conscience is clear I know my mother but the king I have never
seen His dues are nothing to me But it is a great deal to me that my
mother and I should live

Marry me and promise to give it up I will keep your mother

It is good of you she said trembling a little Let me think of it
by myself I would rather not answer now

She reserved her answer till the next day and came into his room with a
solemn face I cannot do what you wished she said passionately It
is too much to ask My whole life ha been passed in this way Her
words and manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with
herself in private and that the contention had been strong

Stockdale turned pale but he spoke quietly Then Lizzy we must part
I cannot go against my principles in this matter and I cannot make my
profession a mockery You know how I love you and what I would do for
you but this one thing I cannot do

But why should you belong to that profession she burst out I have
got this large house why cant you marry me and live here with us and
not be a Methodist preacher any more I assure you Richard it is no
harm and I wish you could only see it as I do We only carry it on in
winter in summer it is never done at all It stirs up ones dull life
at this time o the year and gives excitement which I have got so used
to now that I should hardly know how to do ithout it At nights when
the wind blows instead of being dull and stupid and not noticing
whether it do blow or not your mind is afield even if you are not
afield yourself and you are wondering how the chaps are getting on and
you walk up and down the room and look out o window and then you go
out yourself and know your way about as well by night as by day and
have hairbreadth escapes from old Latimer and his fellows who are too
stupid ever to really frighten us and only make us a bit nimble

He frightened you a little last night anyhow and I would advise you to
drop it before it is worse

She shook her head No I must go on as I have begun I was born to
it It is in my blood and I cant be cured O Richard you cannot
think what a hard thing you have asked and how sharp you try me when you
put me between this and my love for ee

Stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantelpiece his hands over
his eyes We ought never to have met Lizzy he said It was an ill
day for us I little thought there was anything so hopeless and
impossible in our engagement as this Well it is too late now to regret
consequences in this way I have had the happiness of seeing you and
knowing you at least

You dissent from Church and I dissent from State she said And I
dont see why we are not well matched

He smiled sadly while Lizzy remained looking down her eyes beginning to
overflow

That was an unhappy evening for both of them and the days that followed
were unhappy days Both she and he went mechanically about their
employments and his depression was marked in the village by more than
one of his denomination with whom he came in contact But Lizzy who
passed her days indoors was unsuspected of being the cause for it was
generally understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed between her
and her cousin Owlett and had existed for some time

Thus uncertainly the week passed on till one morning Stockdale said to
her I have had a letter Lizzy I must call you that till I am gone

Gone said she blankly

Yes he said I am going from this place I felt it would be better
for us both that I should not stay after what has happened In fact I
couldnt stay here and look on you from day to day without becoming
weak and faltering in my course I have just heard of an arrangement by
which the other minister can arrive here in about a week and let me go
elsewhere

That he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution
came upon her as a grievous surprise You never loved me she said
bitterly

I might say the same he returned but I will not Grant me one
favour Come and hear my last sermon on the day before I go

Lizzy who was a churchgoer on Sunday mornings frequently attended
Stockdales chapel in the evening with the rest of the doubleminded and
she promised

It became known that Stockdale was going to leave and a good many people
outside his own sect were sorry to hear it The intervening days flew
rapidly away and on the evening of the Sunday which preceded the morning
of his departure Lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for the last time
The little building was full to overflowing and he took up the subject
which all had expected that of the contraband trade so extensively
practised among them His hearers in laying his words to their own
hearts did not perceive that they were most particularly directed
against Lizzy till the sermon waxed warm and Stockdale nearly broke
down with emotion In truth his own earnestness and her sad eyes
looking up at him were too much for the young mans equanimity He
hardly knew how he ended He saw Lizzy as through a mist turn and go
away with the rest of the congregation and shortly afterwards followed
her home

She invited him to supper and they sat down alone her mother having as
was usual with her on Sunday nights gone to bed early

We will part friends wont we said Lizzy with forced gaiety and
never alluding to the sermon a reticence which rather disappointed him

We will he said with a forced smile on his part and they sat down

It was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their lives
and probably the last that they would so share When it was over and
the indifferent conversation could no longer be continued he arose and
took her hand Lizzy he said do you say we must partdo you

You do she said solemnly I can say no more

Nor I said he If that is your answer goodbye

Stockdale bent over her and kissed her and she involuntarily returned
his kiss I shall go early he said hurriedly I shall not see you
again

And he did leave early He fancied when stepping forth into the grey
morning light to mount the van which was to carry him away that he saw
a face between the parted curtains of Lizzys window but the light was
faint and the panes glistened with wet so he could not be sure
Stockdale mounted the vehicle and was gone and on the following Sunday
the new minister preached in the chapel of the Moynton Wesleyans

One day two years after the parting Stockdale now settled in a midland
town came into NetherMoynton by carrier in the original way Jogging
along in the van that afternoon he had put questions to the driver and
the answers that he received interested the minister deeply The result
of them was that he went without the least hesitation to the door of his
former lodging It was about six oclock in the evening and the same
time of year as when he had left now too the ground was damp and
glistening the west was bright and Lizzys snowdrops were raising their
heads in the border under the wall

Lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window for by the time that
he reached the door she was there holding it open and then as if she
had not sufficiently considered her act of coming out she drew herself
back saying with some constraint Mr Stockdale

You knew it was said Stockdale taking her hand I wrote to say I
should call

Yes but you did not say when she answered

I did not I was not quite sure when my business would lead me to these
parts

You only came because business brought you near

Well that is the fact but I have often thought I should like to come
on purpose to see you    But whats all this that has happened I
told you how it would be Lizzy and you would not listen to me

I would not she said sadly But I had been brought up to that life
and it was second nature to me However it is all over now The
officers have bloodmoney for taking a man dead or alive and the trade
is going to nothing We were hunted down like rats

Owlett is quite gone I hear

Yes He is in America We had a dreadful struggle that last time when
they tried to take him It is a perfect miracle that he lived through
it and it is a wonder that I was not killed I was shot in the hand It
was not by aim the shot was really meant for my cousin but I was
behind looking on as usual and the bullet came to me It bled
terribly but I got home without fainting and it healed after a time
You know how he suffered

No said Stockdale I only heard that he just escaped with his life

He was shot in the back but a rib turned the ball He was badly hurt
We would not let him be took The men carried him all night across the
meads to Kingsbere and hid him in a barn dressing his wound as well as
they could till he was so far recovered as to be able to get about He
had gied up his mill for some time and at last he got to Bristol and
took a passage to America and hes settled in Wisconsin

What do you think of smuggling now said the minister gravely

I own that we were wrong said she But I have suffered for it I am
very poor now and my mother has been dead these twelve months    But
wont you come in Mr Stockdale

Stockdale went in and it is to be supposed that they came to an
understanding for a fortnight later there was a sale of Lizzys
furniture and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighbouring town

He took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made for
himself in his native county where she studied her duties as a
ministers wife with praiseworthy assiduity It is said that in after
years she wrote an excellent tract called Render unto Caesar or The
Repentant Villagers in which her own experience was anonymously used as
the introductory story Stockdale got it printed after making some
corrections and putting in a few powerful sentences of his own and many
hundreds of copies were distributed by the couple in the course of their
married life
