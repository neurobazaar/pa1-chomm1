UNSER KARL


The American consul for Schlachtstadt had just turned out of the broad
Konigs Allee into the little square that held his consulate Its
residences always seemed to him to wear that singularly uninhabited air
peculiar to a street scene in a theatre The facades with their stiff
striped wooden awnings over the windows were of the regularity color
and pattern only seen on the stage and conversation carried on in the
street below always seemed to be invested with that perfect confidence
and security which surrounds the actor in his painted desert of urban
perspective Yet it was a peaceful change to the other byways and
highways of Schlachtstadt which were always filled with an equally
unreal and mechanical soldiery who appeared to be daily taken out of
their boxes of caserne or depot and loosely scattered all over
the pretty lindenhaunted German town There were soldiers standing on
street corners soldiers staring woodenly into shop windows soldiers
halted suddenly into stone like lizards at the approach of Offiziere
Offiziere lounging stiffly four abreast sweeping the pavement with
their trailing sabres all at one angle There were cavalcades of
red hussars cavalcades of blue hussars cavalcades of Uhlans with
glittering lances and pennonswith or without a bandformally
parading there were straggling fatigues or details coming round
the corners there were dusty businesslike columns of infantry going
nowhere and to no purpose And they one and all seemed to be WOUND
UPfor that serviceand apparently always in the same place In the
band of their capsinvariably of one patternwas a button in the
centre of which was a square opening or keyhole The consul was always
convinced that through this keyhole opening by means of a key the
humblest caporal wound up his file the Hauptmann controlled his
lieutenants and noncommissioned officers and even the general himself
wearing the same cap was subject through his cap to a higher moving
power In the suburbs when the supply of soldiers gave out there
were sentryboxes when these dropped off there were caissons or
commissary wagons And lest the military idea should ever fail from
out the Schlachtstadts burghers mind there were police in uniform
streetsweepers in uniform the tickettakers guards and sweepers at
the Bahnhof were in uniformbut all wearing the same kind of cap with
the probability of having been wound up freshly each morning for their
daily work Even the postman delivered peaceful invoices to the consul
with his sidearms and the air of bringing dispatches from the field
of battle and the consul saluted and felt for a few moments the whole
weight of his consular responsibility

Yet in spite of this military precedence it did not seem in the least
inconsistent with the decidedly peaceful character of the town and this
again suggested its utter unreality wandering cows sometimes got mixed
up with squadrons of cavalry and did not seem to mind it sheep passed
singly between files of infantry or preceded them in a flock when on
the march indeed nothing could be more delightful and innocent than
to see a regiment of infantry in heavy marching order laden with every
conceivable thing they could want for a week returning after a cheerful
search for an invisible enemy in the suburbs to bivouac peacefully
among the cabbages in the marketplace Nobody was ever imposed upon
for a moment by their tremendous energy and severe display drums might
beat trumpets blow dragoons charge furiously all over the Exercier
Platz or suddenly flash their naked swords in the streets to the
guttural command of an officernobody seemed to mind it People glanced
up to recognize Rudolf or Max doing their service nodded and went
about their business And although the officers always wore their
sidearms and at the most peaceful of social dinners only relinquished
their swords in the hall apparently that they might be ready to buckle
them on again and rush out to do battle for the Fatherland between the
courses the other guests only looked upon these weapons in the light
of sticks and umbrellas and possessed their souls in peace And
when added to this singular incongruity many of these warriors were
spectacled studious men and despite their lethal weapons wore a
slightly professional air and wereto a mandeeply sentimental and
singularly simple their attitude in this eternal Kriegspiel seemed to
the consul more puzzling than ever

As he entered his consulate he was confronted with another aspect of
Schlachtstadt quite as wonderful yet already familiar to him For
in spite of these alarums without which however never seem to
penetrate beyond the town itself Schlachtstadt and its suburbs were
known all over the world for the manufactures of certain beautiful
textile fabrics and many of the rank and file of those warriors had
built up the fame and prosperity of the district over their peaceful
looms in wayside cottages There were great depots and countinghouses
larger than even the cavalry barracks where no other uniform but that
of the postman was known Hence it was that the consuls chief duty
was to uphold the flag of his own country by the examination
and certification of divers invoices sent to his office by the
manufacturers But oddly enough these business messengers were chiefly
womennot clerks but ordinary household servants and on busy days
the consulate might have been mistaken for a female registry office
so filled and possessed it was by waiting Madchen Here it was that
Gretchen Lieschen and Clarchen in the cleanest of blue gowns and
stoutly but smartly shod brought their invoices in a piece of clean
paper or folded in a blue handkerchief and laid them with fingers
more or less worn and stubby from hard service before the consul for
his signature Once in the case of a very young Madchen that signature
was blotted by the sweep of a flaxen braid upon it as the child turned
to go but generally there was a grave serious business instinct and
sense of responsibility in these girls of ordinary peasant origin which
equally with their sisters of France were unknown to the English or
American woman of any class

That morning however there was a slight stir among those who with
their knitting were waiting their turn in the outer office as the
viceconsul ushered the police inspector into the consuls private
office He was in uniform of course and it took him a moment to
recover from his habitual stiff military salutea little stiffer than
that of the actual soldier

It was a matter of importance A stranger had that morning been arrested
in the town and identified as a military deserter He claimed to be an
American citizen he was now in the outer office waiting the consuls
interrogation

The consul knew however that the ominous accusation had only a mild
significance here The term military deserter included any one who
had in youth emigrated to a foreign country without first fulfilling his
military duty to his fatherland His first experiences of these cases
had been tedious and difficultinvolving a reference to his Minister
at Berlin a correspondence with the American State Department a
condition of unpleasant tension and finally the prolonged detention of
some innocent GermannaturalizedAmerican citizen who had forgotten
to bring his papers with him in revisiting his own native country It so
chanced however that the consul enjoyed the friendship and confidence
of the General Adlerkreutz who commanded the 20th Division and it
further chanced that the same Adlerkreutz was as gallant a soldier as
ever cried Vorwarts at the head of his men as profound a military
strategist and organizer as ever carried his own and his enemys
plans in his iron head and spiked helmet and yet with as simple and
unaffected a soul breathing under his gray mustache as ever issued from
the lips of a child So this grim but gentle veteran had arranged
with the consul that in cases where the presumption of nationality
was strong although the evidence was not present he would take the
consuls parole for the appearance of the deserter or his papers
without the aid of prolonged diplomacy In this way the consul had saved
to Milwaukee a worthy but imprudent brewer and to New York an excellent
sausage butcher and possible alderman but had returned to martial duty
one or two tramps or journeymen who had never seen America except from
the decks of the ships in which they were stowaways and on which they
were returnedand thus the temper and peace of two great nations were
preserved

He says said the inspector severely that he is an American citizen
but has lost his naturalization papers Yet he has made the damaging
admission to others that he lived several years in Rome And continued
the inspector looking over his shoulder at the closed door as he placed
his finger beside his nose he says he has relations living
at Palmyra whom he frequently visited Ach Observe this
unheardofandnottobetrusted statement

The consul however smiled with a slight flash of intelligence Let me
see him he said

They passed into the outer office another policeman and a corporal of
infantry saluted and rose In the centre of an admiring and sympathetic
crowd of Dienstmadchen sat the culprit the least concerned of the
party a striplinga boyscarcely out of his teens Indeed it was
impossible to conceive of a more innocent bucolic and almost angelic
looking derelict With a skin that had the peculiar white and rosiness
of fresh pork he had blue eyes celestially wide open and staring and
the thick flocculent yellow curls of the sun god He might have been
an overgrown and badly dressed Cupid who had innocently wandered from
Paphian shores He smiled as the consul entered and wiped from his
full red lips with the back of his hand the traces of a sausage he was
eating The consul recognized the flavor at oncehe had smelled it
before in Lieschens little handbasket

You say you lived at Rome began the consul pleasantly Did you take
out your first declaration of your intention of becoming an American
citizen there

The inspector cast an approving glance at the consul fixed a stern eye
on the cherubic prisoner and leaned back in his chair to hear the reply
to this terrible question

I dont remember said the culprit knitting his brows in infantine
thought It was either there or at Madrid or Syracuse

The inspector was about to rise this was really trifling with the
dignity of the municipality But the consul laid his hand on the
officials sleeve and opening an American atlas to a map of the State
of New York said to the prisoner as he placed the inspectors hand on
the sheet I see you know the names of the TOWNS on the Erie and New
York Central Railroad But

I can tell you the number of people in each town and what are the
manufactures interrupted the young fellow with youthful vanity
Madrid has six thousand and there are over sixty thousand in

That will do said the consul as a murmur of Wunderschon went round
the group of listening servant girls while glances of admiration were
shot at the beaming accused But you ought to remember the name of the
town where your naturalization papers were afterwards sent

But I was a citizen from the moment I made my declaration said the
stranger smiling and looking triumphantly at his admirers and I could
vote

The inspector since he had come to grief over American geographical
nomenclature was grimly taciturn The consul however was by no means
certain of his victory His alleged fellow citizen was too encyclopaedic
in his knowledge a clever youth might have crammed for this with a
textbook but then he did not LOOK at all clever indeed he had rather
the stupidity of the mythological subject he represented Leave him
with me said the consul The inspector handed him a precis of the
case The cherubs name was Karl Schwartz an orphan missing from
Schlachtstadt since the age of twelve Relations not living or in
emigration Identity established by prisoners admission and record

Now Karl said the consul cheerfully as the door of his private
office closed upon them what is your little game Have you EVER had
any papers And if you were clever enough to study the map of New York
State why werent you clever enough to see that it wouldnt stand you
in place of your papers

Dots joost it said Karl in English but you see dot if I haf
declairet mine intention of begomming a citizen its all the same
dont it

By no means for you seem to have no evidence of the DECLARATION no
papers at all

Zo said Karl Nevertheless he pushed his small rosy
pickledpigsfeet of fingers through his fleecy curls and beamed
pleasantly at the consul Dots vots der matter he said as if
taking a kindly interest in some private trouble of the consuls Dots
vere you vos eh

The consul looked steadily at him for a moment Such stupidity was by
no means phenomenal nor at all inconsistent with his appearance And
continued the consul gravely I must tell you that unless you have
other proofs than you have shown it will be my duty to give you up to
the authorities

Dot means I shall serve my time eh said Karl with an unchanged
smile

Exactly so returned the consul

Zo said karl Dese towndose Schlachtstadtis fine town eh Fine
vomens Goot men Und beer und sausage Blenty to eat and drink eh
Und looking around the room you and te poys haf a gay times

Yes said the consul shortly turning away But he presently faced
round again on the unfettered Karl who was evidently indulging in a
gormandizing reverie

What on earth brought you here anyway

Was it das

What brought you here from America or wherever you ran away from

To see der volks

But you are an ORPHAN you know and you have no folks living here

But all Shermany is mine volksde whole gountry dont it Pet your
poots Hows dot eh

The consul turned back to his desk and wrote a short note to General
Adlerkreutz in his own American German He did not think it his duty
in the present case to interfere with the authorities or to offer his
parole for Karl Schwartz But he would claim that as the offender
was evidently an innocent emigrant and still young any punishment or
military degradation be omitted and he be allowed to take his place
like any other recruit in the ranks If he might have the temerity to
the undoubted farseeing military authority of suggestion making here
he would suggest that Karl was for the commissariat fitted Of course
he still retained the right on production of satisfactory proof his
discharge to claim

The consul read this aloud to Karl The cherubic youth smiled and said
Zo Then extending his hand he added the word Zshake

The consul shook his hand a little remorsefully and preceding him to
the outer room resigned him with the note into the inspectors hands A
universal sigh went up from the girls and glances of appeal sought the
consul but he wisely concluded that it would be well for a while that
Karla helpless orphanshould be under some sort of discipline And
the securer business of certifying invoices recommenced

Late that afternoon he received a folded bit of blue paper from the
waistbelt of an orderly which contained in English characters and as
a single word Alright followed by certain jagged penmarks which he
recognized as Adlerkreutzs signature But it was not until a week later
that he learned anything definite He was returning one night to his
lodgings in the residential part of the city and in opening the door
with his passkey perceived in the rear of the hall his handmaiden
Trudschen attended by the usual blue or yellow or red shadow He was
passing by them with the local n Abend on his lips when the soldier
turned his face and saluted The consul stopped It was the cherub Karl
in uniform

But it had not subdued a single one of his characteristics His hair
had been cropped a little more closely under his cap but there was its
color and woolliness still intact his plump figure was girt by belt and
buttons but he only looked the more unreal and more like a combination
of penwiper and pincushion until his puffy breast and shoulders seemed
to offer a positive invitation to any one who had picked up a pin But
wonderfulaccording to his brief storyhe had been so proficient
in the goose step that he had been put in uniform already and allowed
certain small privilegesamong them evidently the present one
The consul smiled and passed on But it seemed strange to him that
Trudschen who was a tall strapping girl exceedingly popular with
the military and who had never looked lower than a corporal at least
should accept the attentions of an Einjahriger like that Later he
interrogated her

Ach it was only Unser Karl And the consul knew he was Amerikanisch

Indeed

Yes It was such a tearful story

Tell me what it is said the consul with a faint hope that Karl had
volunteered some communication of his past

Ach Gott There in America he was a man and could vote make laws
and God willing become a town counciloror Ober Intendantand
here he was nothing but a soldier for years And this America was a
fine country Wunderschon There were such big cities and one
Booflocould hold all Schlachtstadt and had of people five hundred
thousand

The consul sighed Karl had evidently not yet got off the line of the
New York Central and Erie roads But does he remember yet what he did
with his papers said the consul persuasively

Ach What does he want with PAPERS when he could make the laws They
were dumb stupid thingsthese papersto him

But his appetite remains good I hope suggested the consul

This closed the conversation although Karl came on many other nights
and his toy figure quite supplanted the tall corporal of hussars in the
remote shadows of the hall One night however the consul returned home
from a visit to a neighboring town a day earlier than he was expected
As he neared his house he was a little surprised to find the windows of
his sittingroom lit up and that there were no signs of Trudschen in
the lower hall or passages He made his way upstairs in the dark and
pushed open the door of his apartment To his astonishment Karl was
sitting comfortably in his own chair his cap off before a studentlamp
on the table deeply engaged in apparent study So profound was his
abstraction that it was a moment before he looked up and the consul had
a good look at his usually beaming and responsive face which however
now struck him as wearing a singular air of thought and concentration
When their eyes at last met he rose instantly and saluted and
his beaming smile returned But either from his natural phlegm or
extraordinary selfcontrol he betrayed neither embarrassment nor alarm

The explanation he gave was direct and simple Trudschen had gone out
with the Corporal Fritz for a short walk and had asked him to keep
house during their absence He had no books no papers nothing to read
in the barracks and no chance to improve his mind He thought the Herr
Consul would not object to his looking at his books The consul was
touched it was really a trivial indiscretion and as much Trudschens
fault as Karls And if the poor fellow had any mind to improvehis
recent attitude certainly suggested thought and reflectionthe consul
were a brute to reprove him He smiled pleasantly as Karl returned a
stubby bit of pencil and some greasy memoranda to his breast pocket and
glanced at the table But to his surprise it was a large map that Karl
had been studying and to his still greater surprise a map of the
consuls own district

You seem to be fond of mapstudying said the consul pleasantly You
are not thinking of emigrating again

Ach no said Karl simply it is my cousine vot haf lif near here I
find her

But he left on Trudschens return and the consul was surprised to
see that while Karls attitude towards her had not changed the girl
exhibited less effusiveness than before Believing it to be partly
the effect of the return of the corporal the consul taxed her with
faithlessness But Trudschen looked grave

Ah He has new friends this Karl of ours He cares no more for poor
girls like us When fine ladies like the old Frau von Wimpfel make much
of him what will you

It appeared indeed from Trudschens account that the widow of a
wealthy shopkeeper had made a kind of protege of the young soldier
and given him presents Furthermore that the wife of his colonel had
employed him to act as page or attendant at an afternoon Gesellschaft
and that since then the wives of other officers had sought him Did not
the Herr Consul think it was dreadful that this American who could vote
and make laws should be subjected to such things

The consul did not know what to think It seemed to him however that
Karl was getting on and that he was not in need of his assistance
It was in the expectation of hearing more about him however that
he cheerfully accepted an invitation from Adlerkreutz to dine at the
Caserne one evening with the staff Here he found somewhat to his
embarrassment that the dinner was partly in his own honor and at the
close of five courses and the emptying of many bottles his health was
proposed by the gallant veteran Adlerkreutz in a neat address of many
syllables containing all the parts of speech and a single verb It was
to the effect that in his soulfriend the Herr Consul and himself was
the nevertobesevered union of Germania and Columbia and in their
perfect understanding was the wardefying alliance of two great nations
and that in the consuls noble restoration of Unser Karl to the German
army there was the astute diplomacy of a great mind He was satisfied
that himself and the Herr Consul still united in the great future
looking down upon a common brotherhoodthe great GermanicAmerican
Confederationwould feel satisfied with themselves and each other
and their nevertobeforgotten earthlabors Cries of Hoch Hoch
resounded through the apartment with the grinding roll of heavybottomed
beerglasses and the consul tremulous with emotion and a reserve verb
in his pocket rose to reply Fully embarked upon this perilous voyage
and steering wide and clear of any treacherous shore of intelligence or
fancied harbor of understanding and rest he kept boldly out at sea He
said that while his loving adversary in this battle of compliment had
disarmed him and left him no words to reply to his generous panegyric
he could not but join with that gallant soldier in his heartfelt
aspirations for the peaceful alliance of both countries But while he
fully reciprocated all his hosts broader and higher sentiments he must
point out to this gallant assembly this glorious brotherhood that
even a greater tie of sympathy knitted him to the generalthe tie of
kinship For while it was well known to the present company that their
gallant commander had married an Englishwoman he the consul although
always an American would now for the first time confess to them that he
HIMSELF was of Dutch descent on his mothers side He would say no more
but confidently leave them in possession of the tremendous significance
of this untilthenunknown fact He sat down with the forgotten verb
still in his pocket but the applause that followed this perfectly
conclusive satisfying and logical climax convinced him of his success
His hand was grasped eagerly by successive warriors the general turned
and embraced him before the breathless assembly there were tears in the
consuls eyes

As the festivities progressed however he found to his surprise that
Karl had not only become the fashion as a military page but that his
naive stupidity and sublime simplicity was the wondering theme and
inexhaustible delight of the whole barracks Stories were told of his
genius for blundering which rivaled Handy Andys old stories of fatuous
ignorance were rearranged and fitted to our Karl It was our Karl
who on receiving a tip of two marks from the hands of a young lady to
whom he had brought the bouquet of a gallant lieutenant exhibited some
hesitation and finally said Yes but gnadiges Fraulein that COST us
nine marks It was our Karl who interrupting the regrets of another
lady that she was unable to accept his masters invitation said
politely Ah what matter Gnadigste I have still a letter for
Fraulein Kopp her rival and I was told that I must not invite you
both It was our Karl who astonished the hostess to whom he was sent
at the last moment with apologies from an officer unexpectedly detained
at barrack duty by suggesting that he should bring that unfortunate
officer his dinner from the just served table Nor were these charming
infelicities confined to his social and domestic service Although
ready mechanical and invariably docile in the manual and physical
duties of a soldierwhich endeared him to the German drillmasterhe
was still invincibly ignorant as to its purport or even the meaning
and structure of the military instruments he handled or vacantly
looked upon It was our Karl who suggested to his instructors that in
fieldfiring it was quicker and easier to load his musket to the
muzzle at once and get rid of its deathdealing contents at a single
discharge than to load and fire consecutively It was our Karl who
nearly killed the instructor at sentry drill by adhering to the letter
of his instructions when that instructor had forgotten the password
It was the same Karl who severely admonished for his recklessness the
next time added to his challenge the precaution Unless you instantly
say Fatherland Ill fire Yet his perfect good humor and childlike
curiosity were unmistakable throughout and incited his comrades and
his superiors to show him everything in the hope of getting some
characteristic comment from him Everything and everybody were open to
Karl and his goodhumored simplicity

That evening as the general accompanied the consul down to the gateway
and the waiting carriage a figure in uniform ran spontaneously before
them and shouted Heraus to the sentries But the general promptly
checked the turning out of the guard with a paternal shake of his
finger to the overzealous soldier in whom the consul recognized Karl
He is my Bursche now said the general explanatorily My wife has
taken a fancy to him Ach he is very popular with these women The
consul was still more surprised The Frau Generalin Adlerkreutz he
knew to be a pronounced Englishwomancarrying out her English
ways proprieties and prejudices in the very heart of Schlachtstadt
uncompromisingly without fear and without reproach That she should
follow a merely foreign society craze or alter her English household so
as to admit the impossible Karl struck him oddly

A month or two elapsed without further news of Karl when one afternoon
he suddenly turned up at the consulate He had again sought the consular
quiet to write a few letters home he had no chance in the confinement
of the barracks

But by this time you must be in the family of a fieldmarshal at
least suggested the consul pleasantly

Not today but next week said Karl with sublime simplicity THEN I
am going to serve with the governor commandant of Rheinfestung

The consul smiled motioned him to a seat at a table in the outer
office and left him undisturbed to his correspondence

Returning later he found Karl his letters finished gazing with
childish curiosity and admiration at some thick official envelopes
bearing the stamp of the consulate which were lying on the table He
was evidently struck with the contrast between them and the thin flimsy
affairs he was holding in his hand He appeared still more impressed
when the consul told him what they were

Are you writing to your friends continued the consul touched by his
simplicity

Ach ja said Karl eagerly

Would you like to put your letter in one of these envelopes continued
the official

The beaming face and eyes of Karl were a sufficient answer After all
it was a small favor granted to this odd waif who seemed to still cling
to the consular protection He handed him the envelope and left him
addressing it in boyish pride

It was Karls last visit to the consulate He appeared to have spoken
truly and the consul presently learned that he had indeed been
transferred through some high official manipulation to the personal
service of the governor of Rheinfestung There was weeping among the
Dienstmadchen of Schlachtstadt and a distinct loss of originality and
lightness in the gatherings of the gentler Hausfrauen His memory
still survived in the barracks through the later editions of his
former delightful stupiditiesmany of them it is to be feared
were inventionsand stories that were supposed to have come from
Rheinfestung were described in the slang of the Offiziere as being
colossal But the consul remembered Rheinfestung and could not
imagine it as a home for Karl or in any way fostering his peculiar
qualities For it was eminently a fortress of fortresses a magazine of
magazines a depot of depots It was the key of the Rhine the citadel
of Westphalia the Clapham Junction of German railways but defended
fortified encompassed and controlled by the newest as well as the
oldest devices of military strategy and science Even in the pipingest
time of peace whole railway trains went into it like a rat in a trap
and might have never come out of it it stretched out an inviting
hand and arm across the river that might in the twinkling of an eye be
changed into a closed fist of menace You defiled into it commanded
at every step by enfilading walls you debouched out of it as you
thought and found yourself only before the walls you reentered it at
every possible angle you did everything apparently but pass through it
You thought yourself well out of it and were stopped by a bastion Its
circumvallations haunted you until you came to the next station It had
pressed even the current of the river into its defensive service There
were secrets of its foundations and mines that only the highest military
despots knew and kept to themselves In a wordit was impregnable

That such a place could not be trifled with or misunderstood in its
rightandacuteangled severities seemed plain to every one But set on
by his companions who were showing him its defensive foundations or
in his own idle curiosity Karl managed to fall into the Rhine and was
fished out with difficulty The immersion may have chilled his military
ardor or soured his good humor for later the consul heard that he had
visited the American consular agent at an adjacent town with the old
story of his American citizenship He seemed said the consuls
colleague to be well posted about American railways and American
towns but he had no papers He lounged around the office for a while
and

Wrote letters home suggested the consul with a flash of
reminiscence

Yes the poor chap had no privacy at the barracks and I reckon was
overlooked or bedeviled

This was the last the consul heard of Karl Schwartz directly for a
week or two later he again fell into the Rhine this time so fatally and
effectually that in spite of the efforts of his companions he was swept
away by the rapid current and thus ended his service to his country
His body was never recovered

A few months before the consul was transferred from Schlachtstadt to
another post his memory of the departed Karl was revived by a visit from
Adlerkreutz The general looked grave

You remember Unser Karl he said

Yes

Do you think he was an impostor

As regards his American citizenship yes But I could not say more

So said the general A very singular thing has happened he added
twirling his mustache The Inspector of police has notified us of the
arrival of a Karl Schwartz in this town It appears he is the REAL Karl
Schwartz identified by his sister as the only one The other who was
drowned was an impostor Hein

Then you have secured another recruit said the consul smilingly

No For this one has already served his time in Elsass where he went
when he left here as a boy But Donnerwetter why should that dumb fool
take his name

By chance I fancy Then he stupidly stuck to it and had to take the
responsibilities with it Dont you see said the consul pleased with
his own cleverness

Zoo said the general slowly in his deepest voice But the German
exclamation has a variety of significance according to the inflection
and Adlerkreutzs ejaculation seemed to contain them all



It was in Paris where the consul had lingered on his way to his new
post He was sitting in a wellknown cafe among whose habitues were
several military officers of high rank A group of them were gathered
round a table near him He was idly watching them with an odd
recollection of Schlachtstadt in his mind and as idly glancing from
them to the more attractive Boulevard without The consul was getting a
little tired of soldiers

Suddenly there was a slight stir in the gesticulating group and a cry of
greeting The consul looked up mechanically and then his eyes remained
fixed and staring at the newcomer For it was the dead Karl Karl
surely Karlhis plump figure belted in a French officers tunic his
flaxen hair clipped a little closer but still its fleece showing under
his kepi Karl his cheeks more cherubic than everunchanged but for a
tiny yellow toy mustache curling up over the corners of his full lips
Karl beaming at his companions in his old way but rattling off French
vivacities without the faintest trace of accent Could he be mistaken
Was it some phenomenal resemblance or had the soul of the German
private been transmigrated to the French officer

The consul hurriedly called the garcon Who is that officer who has
just arrived

It is the Captain Christian of the Intelligence Bureau said the
waiter with proud alacrity A famous officer brave as a rabbitun
fier lapinand one of our best clients So drole too such a farceur
and mimic Msieur would be ravished to hear his imitations

But he looks like a German and his name

Ah he is from Alsace But not a German said the waiter absolutely
whitening with indignation He was at Belfort So was I Mon Dieu No
a thousand times no

But has he been living here long said the consul

In Paris a few months But his Department Msieur understands takes
him EVERYWHERE Everywhere where he can gain information

The consuls eyes were still on the Captain Christian Presently the
officer perhaps instinctively conscious of the scrutiny looked towards
him Their eyes met To the consuls surprise the cidevant Karl beamed
upon him and advanced with outstretched hand

But the consul stiffened slightly and remained so with his glass in his
hand At which Captain Christian brought his own easily to a military
salute and said politely

Monsieur le Consul has been promoted from his post Permit me to
congratulate him

You have heard then said the consul dryly

Otherwise I should not presume For our Department makes it a
businessin Monsieur le Consuls case it becomes a pleasureto know
everything

Did your Department know that the real Karl Schwartz has returned
said the consul dryly

Captain Christian shrugged his shoulders Then it appears that the sham
Karl died none too soon he said lightly And yethe bent his eyes
with mischievous reproach upon the consul

Yet what demanded the consul sternly

Monsieur le Consul might have saved the unfortunate man by accepting
him as an American citizen and not helping to force him into the German
service

The consul saw in a flash the full military significance of this logic
and could not repress a smile At which Captain Christian dropped easily
into a chair beside him and as easily into broken German English

Und he went on dees towndees Schlachtstadt is fine town eh Fine
womens Goot men Und peer and sausage Blenty to eat and trink eh Und
you und te poys haf a gay times

The consul tried to recover his dignity The waiter behind him
recognizing only the delightful mimicry of this adorable officer was in
fits of laughter Nevertheless the consul managed to say dryly

And the barracks the magazines the commissariat the details the
reserves of Schlachtstadt were very interesting

Assuredly

And Rheinfestungits plansits details even its dangerous
foundations by the riverthey were to a soldier singularly

UNCLE JIM AND UNCLE BILLY


They were partners The avuncular title was bestowed on them by Cedar
Camp possibly in recognition of a certain matured good humor quite
distinct from the spasmodic exuberant spirits of its other members
and possibly from what to its youthful sense seemed their advanced
ageswhich must have been at least forty They had also set habits
even in their improvidence lost incalculable and unpayable sums to
each other over euchre regularly every evening and inspected their
sluiceboxes punctually every Saturday for repairswhich they never
made They even got to resemble each other after the fashion of old
married couples or rather as in matrimonial partnerships were
subject to the domination of the stronger character although in
their case it is to be feared that it was the feminine Uncle
Billyenthusiastic imaginative and loquaciouswho swayed the
masculine steadygoing and practical Uncle Jim They had lived in the
camp since its foundation in 1849 there seemed to be no reason why
they should not remain there until its inevitable evolution into a
miningtown The younger members might leave through restless ambition
or a desire for change or novelty they were subject to no such trifling
mutation Yet Cedar Camp was surprised one day to hear that Uncle Billy
was going away

The rain was softly falling on the bark thatch of the cabin with a
muffled murmur like a sound heard through sleep The southwest trades
were warm even at that altitude as the open door testified although
a fire of pine bark was flickering on the adobe hearth and striking out
answering fires from the freshly scoured culinary utensils on the rude
sideboard which Uncle Jim had cleaned that morning with his usual
serious persistency Their best clothes which were interchangeable and
worn alternately by each other on festal occasions hung on the
walls which were covered with a coarse sailcloth canvas instead of
lathandplaster and were diversified by pictures from illustrated
papers and stains from the exterior weather Two bunks like ships
berthsan upper and lower oneoccupied the gableend of this single
apartment and on beds of coarse sacking filled with dry moss were
carefully rolled their respective blankets and pillows They were the
only articles not used in common and whose individuality was respected

Uncle Jim who had been sitting before the fire rose as the square bulk
of his partner appeared at the doorway with an armful of wood for the
evening stove By that sign he knew it was nine oclock for the last
six years Uncle Billy had regularly brought in the wood at that hour
and Uncle Jim had as regularly closed the door after him and set out
their single table containing a greasy pack of cards taken from its
drawer a bottle of whiskey and two tin drinkingcups To this was
added a ragged memorandumbook and a stick of pencil The two men drew
their stools to the table

Hol on a minit said Uncle Billy

His partner laid down the cards as Uncle Billy extracted from his pocket
a pillbox and opening it gravely took a pill This was clearly an
innovation on their regular proceedings for Uncle Billy was always in
perfect health

Whats this for asked Uncle Jim half scornfully

Agin ager

You aint got no ager said Uncle Jim with the assurance of intimate
cognizance of his partners physical condition

But its a powful preventive Quinine Saw this box at Rileys store
and laid out a quarter on it We kin keep it here comfortable for
evenings Its mighty soothin arter a mans done a hard days work on
the riverbar Take one

Uncle Jim gravely took a pill and swallowed it and handed the box back
to his partner

Well leave it on the table sociable like in case any of the boys
come in said Uncle Billy taking up the cards Well How do we
stand

Uncle Jim consulted the memorandumbook You were owin me sixtytwo
thousand dollars on the last game and the limits seventyfive
thousand

Je whillikins ejaculated Uncle Billy Let me see

He examined the book feebly attempted to challenge the additions but
with no effect on the total We oughter hev made the limit a hundred
thousand he said seriously seventyfive thousand is only triflin
in a game like ours And youve set down my claim at Angels he
continued

I allowed you ten thousand dollars for that said Uncle Jim with
equal gravity and its a fancy price too

The claim in question being an unprospected hillside ten miles distant
which Uncle Jim had never seen and Uncle Billy had not visited for
years the statement was probably true nevertheless Uncle Billy
retorted

Ye kin never tell how these things will pan out Why only this mornin
I was taking a turn round Shot Up Hill that ye know is just rotten with
quartz and gold and I couldnt help thinkin how much it was like my
ole claim at Angels I must take a day off to go on there and strike a
pick in it if only for luck

Suddenly he paused and said Strange aint it you should speak of it
tonight Now I call that queer

He laid down his cards and gazed mysteriously at his companion Uncle
Jim knew perfectly that Uncle Billy had regularly once a week for
many years declared his final determination to go over to Angels and
prospect his claim yet nevertheless he half responded to his partners
suggestion of mystery and a look of fatuous wonder crept into his eyes
But he contented himself by saying cautiously You spoke of it first

Thats the more singlar said Uncle Billy confidently And Ive been
thinking about it and kinder seeing myself thar all day Its mighty
queer He got up and began to rummage among some torn and coverless
books in the corner

Wheres that Dream Book gone to

The Carson boys borrowed it replied Uncle Jim Anyhow yours wasnt
no dreamonly a kind o vision and the book dont take no stock in
visions Nevertheless he watched his partner with some sympathy and
added That reminds me that I had a dream the other night of being in
Frisco at a small hotel with heaps o money and all the time being
sort o scared and bewildered over it

No queried his partner eagerly yet reproachfully You never let
on anything about it to ME Its mighty queer you havin these strange
feelins for Ive had em myself And only tonight comin up from
the spring I saw two crows hopping in the trail and I says If I see
another its luck sure And youll think Im lyin but when I went
to the woodpile just now there was the THIRD one sittin up on a log as
plain as I see you Tell e what folks ken laughbut thats just what
Jim Filgee saw the night before he made the big strike

They were both smiling yet with an underlying credulity and seriousness
as singularly pathetic as it seemed incongruous to their years and
intelligence Small wonder however that in their occupation and
environmentliving daily in an atmosphere of hope expectation and
chance looking forward each morning to the blind stroke of a pick that
might bring fortunethey should see signs in nature and hear mystic
voices in the trackless woods that surrounded them Still less strange
that they were peculiarly susceptible to the more recognized diversions
of chance and were gamblers on the turning of a card who trusted to the
revelation of a shovelful of upturned earth

It was quite natural therefore that they should return from their
abstract form of divination to the table and their cards But they were
scarcely seated before they heard a crackling step in the brush outside
and the free latch of their door was lifted A younger member of the
camp entered He uttered a peevish Halloo which might have passed
for a greeting or might have been a slight protest at finding the door
closed drew the stool from which Uncle Jim had just risen before the
fire shook his wet clothes like a Newfoundland dog and sat down Yet
he was by no means churlish nor coarselooking and this act was rather
one of easygoing selfish youthful familiarity than of rudeness The
cabin of Uncles Billy and Jim was considered a public right or common
of the camp Conferences between individual miners were appointed there
Ill meet you at Uncle Billys was a common tryst Added to this was a
tacit claim upon the partners arbitrative powers or the equal right to
request them to step outside if the interviews were of a private nature
Yet there was never any objection on the part of the partners and
tonight there was not a shadow of resentment of this intrusion in the
patient goodhumored tolerant eyes of Uncles Jim and Billy as they
gazed at their guest Perhaps there was a slight gleam of relief in
Uncle Jims when he found that the guest was unaccompanied by any one
and that it was not a tryst It would have been unpleasant for the
two partners to have stayed out in the rain while their guests were
exchanging private confidences in their cabin While there might have
been no limit to their good will there might have been some to their
capacity for exposure

Uncle Jim drew a huge log from beside the hearth and sat on the driest
end of it while their guest occupied the stool The young man without
turning away from his discontented peevish brooding over the fire
vaguely reached backward for the whiskeybottle and Uncle Billys tin
cup to which he was assisted by the latters hospitable hand But on
setting down the cup his eye caught sight of the pillbox

Wots that he said with gloomy scorn Rat poison

Quinine pillsagin ager said Uncle Jim The newest thing out Keeps
out damp like Injinrubber Take one to follow yer whiskey Me and Uncle
Billy wouldnt think o settin down quiet like in the evening arter
work without em Take oneye r welcome We keep em out here for
the boys

Accustomed as the partners were to adopt and wear each others opinions
before folks as they did each others clothing Uncle Billy was
nevertheless astonished and delighted at Uncle Jims enthusiasm over
HIS pills The guest took one and swallowed it

Mighty bitter he said glancing at his hosts with the quick
Californian suspicion of some practical joke But the honest faces of
the partners reassured him

That bitterness ye taste said Uncle Jim quickly is whar the
things gittin in its work Sorter sickenin the malariaand kinder
waterproofin the insides all to onct and at the same lick Dont yer
see Put another in yer vest pocket youll be cryin for em like a
child afore ye get home Thar Well hows things agoin on your claim
Dick Boomin eh

The guest raised his head and turned it sufficiently to fling his answer
back over his shoulder at his hosts I dont know what YOUD call
boomin he said gloomily I suppose you two men sitting here
comfortably by the fire without caring whether school keeps or not
would call two feet of backwater over ones claim boomin I reckon
YOUD consider a hundred and fifty feet of sluicing carried away
and drifting to thunder down the South Fork something in the way of
advertising to your old camp I suppose YOUd think it was an inducement
to investors I shouldnt wonder he added still more gloomily as a
sudden dash of rain down the widethroated chimney dropped in his
tin cupand it would be just like you two chaps sittin there
gormandizing over your quinineif yer said this rain thats lasted
three weeks was something to be proud of

It was the cheerful and the satisfying custom of the rest of the camp
for no reason whatever to hold Uncle Jim and Uncle Billy responsible
for its present location its vicissitudes the weather or any
convulsion of nature and it was equally the partners habit for no
reason whatever to accept these animadversions and apologize

Its a rain thats soft and mellowin said Uncle Billy gently
and supplin to the sinews and muscles Did ye ever notice
Jimostentatiously to his partnerdid ye ever notice that you get
inter a kind o sweaty lather workin in it Sorter openin to the
pores

Fetches em every time said Uncle Billy Better nor fancy soap

Their guest laughed bitterly Well Im going to leave it to you I
reckon to cut the whole concern tomorrow and lite out for something
new It cant be worse than this

The two partners looked grieved albeit they were accustomed to these
outbursts Everybody who thought of going away from Cedar Camp used it
first as a threat to these patient men after the fashion of runaway
nephews or made an exemplary scene of their going

Better think twice afore ye go said Uncle Billy

Ive seen worse weather afore ye came said Uncle Jim slowly Water
all over the Bar the mud so deep ye couldnt get to Angels for a
sack o flour and we had to grub on pine nuts and jackassrabbits And
yetwe stuck by the camp and here we are

The mild answer apparently goaded their guest to fury He rose from his
seat threw back his long dripping hair from his handsome but querulous
face and scattered a few drops on the partners Yes thats just it
Thats what gets me Here you stick and here you are And here youll
stick and rust until you starve or drown Here you aretwo men who
ought to be out in the world playing your part as grown menstuck
here like children playing house in the woods playing work in your
wretched mudpie ditches and content Two men not so old that you
mightnt be taking your part in the fun of the world going to balls
or theatres or paying attention to girls and yet old enough to have
married and have your families around you content to stay in this
Godforsaken place old bachelors pigging together like poorhouse
paupers Thats what gets me Say you LIKE it Say you expect by
hanging on to make a strikeand what does that amount to What are YOUR
chances How many of us have made or are making more than grub wages
Say youre willing to share and share alike as you dohave you got
enough for two Arent you actually living off each other Arent you
grinding each other down choking each others struggles as you sink
together deeper and deeper in the mud of this cussed camp And while
youre doing this arent you by your age and position here holding
out hopes to others that you know cannot be fulfilled

Accustomed as they were to the halfquerulous halfhumorous but always
extravagant criticism of the others there was something so new in this
arraignment of themselves that the partners for a moment sat silent
There was a slight flush on Uncle Billys cheek there was a slight
paleness on Uncle Jims He was the first to reply But he did so with a
certain dignity which neither his partner nor their guest had ever seen
on his face before

As its OUR fire thats warmed ye up like this Dick Bullen he said
slowly rising with his hand resting on Uncle Billys shoulder and as
its OUR whiskey thats loosened your tongue I reckon we must put up
with what ye r saying just as weve managed to put up with our own
way o living and not quoll with ye under our own roof

The young fellow saw the change in Uncle Jims face and quickly extended
his hand with an apologetic backward shake of his long hair Hang
it all old man he said with a laugh of mingled contrition and
amusement you mustnt mind what I said just now Ive been so worried
thinking of things about MYSELF and maybe a little about you that I
quite forgot I hadnt a call to preach to anybodyleast of all to you
So we part friends Uncle Jim and you too Uncle Billy and youll
forget what I said In fact I dont know why I spoke at allonly I
was passing your claim just now and wondering how much longer your old
sluiceboxes would hold out and where in thunder youd get others when
they caved in I reckon that sent me off Thats all old chap

Uncle Billys face broke into a beaming smile of relief and it was HIS
hand that first grasped his guests Uncle Jim quickly followed with
as honest a pressure but with eyes that did not seem to be looking at
Bullen though all trace of resentment had died out of them He walked
to the door with him again shook hands but remained looking out in the
darkness some time after Dick Bullens tangled hair and broad shoulders
had disappeared

Meantime Uncle Billy had resumed his seat and was chuckling and
reminiscent as he cleaned out his pipe

Kinder reminds me of Jo Sharp when he was cleaned out at poker by his
own partners in his own cabin comin up here and bedevilin US about
it What was it you lint him

But Uncle Jim did not reply and Uncle Billy taking up the cards
began to shuffle them smiling vaguely yet at the same time somewhat
painfully Arter all Dick was mighty cut up about what he said and I
felt kinder sorry for him And you know I rather cotton to a man that
speaks his mind Sorter clears him out you know of all the slumgullion
thats in him Its just like washin out a pan o prospecting you pour
in the water and keep slushing it round and round and out comes first
the mud and dirt and then the gravel and then the black sand and
thenits all out and theres a speck o gold glistenin at the
bottom

Then you think there WAS suthin in what he said said Uncle Jim
facing about slowly

An odd tone in his voice made Uncle Billy look up No he said
quickly shying with the instinct of an easy pleasureloving nature from
a possible grave situation No I dont think he ever got the color
But wot are ye moonin about for Aint ye goin to play Its mor n
half past nine now

Thus adjured Uncle Jim moved up to the table and sat down while Uncle
Billy dealt the cards turning up the Jack or right bowerbut WITHOUT
that exclamation of delight which always accompanied his good fortune
nor did Uncle Jim respond with the usual corresponding simulation of
deep disgust Such a circumstance had not occurred before in the history
of their partnership They both played in silencea silence only
interrupted by a larger splash of raindrops down the chimney

We orter put a couple of stones on the chimneytop edgewise like Jack
Curtis does It keeps out the rain without interferin with the draft
said Uncle Billy musingly

Whats the use if

If what said Uncle Billy quietly

If we dont make it broader said Uncle Jim half wearily

They both stared at the chimney but Uncle Jims eye followed the wall
around to the bunks There were many discolorations on the canvas and
a picture of the Goddess of Liberty from an illustrated paper had broken
out in a kind of damp measly eruption Ill stick that funny handbill
of the Washin Soda I got at the grocery store the other day right
over the Liberty gal Its a mighty perty woman washin with short
sleeves said Uncle Billy Thats the comfort of them picters you kin
always get somethin new and it adds thickness to the wall

Uncle Jim went back to the cards in silence After a moment he rose
again and hung his overcoat against the door

Winds comin in he said briefly

Yes said Uncle Billy cheerfully but it wouldnt seem natral if
there wasnt that crack in the door to let the sunlight in o mornins
Makes a kind o sundial you know When the streak o lights in
that corner I says six oclock when its across the chimney I say
seven and so tis

It certainly had grown chilly and the wind was rising The
candle guttered and flickered the embers on the hearth brightened
occasionally as if trying to dispel the gathering shadows but always
ineffectually The game was frequently interrupted by the necessity of
stirring the fire After an interval of gloom in which each partner
successively drew the candle to his side to examine his cards Uncle Jim
said

Say

Well responded Uncle Billy

Are you sure you saw that third crow on the woodpile

Sure as I see you nowand a darned sight plainer Why

Nothin I was just thinkin Look here How do we stand now

Uncle Billy was still losing Nevertheless he said cheerfully Im
owin you a matter of sixty thousand dollars

Uncle Jim examined the book abstractedly Suppose he said slowly but
without looking at his partner suppose as its gettin late now we
play for my half share of the claim agin the limitseventy thousandto
square up

Your half share repeated Uncle Billy with amused incredulity

My half share of the claimof this yer house you knowone half of
all that Dick Bullen calls our rotten starvation property reiterated
Uncle Jim with a half smile

Uncle Billy laughed It was a novel idea it was of course all in the
air like the rest of their game yet even then he had an odd feeling
that he would have liked Dick Bullen to have known it Wade in old
pard he said Im on it

Uncle Jim lit another candle to reinforce the fading light and the deal
fell to Uncle Billy He turned up Jack of clubs He also turned a little
redder as he took up his cards looked at them and glanced hastily at
his partner Its no use playing he said Look here He laid down
his cards on the table They were the ace king and queen of clubs
and Jack of spadesor left bowerwhich with the turnedup Jack of
clubsor right bowercomprised ALL the winning cards

By jingo If wed been playin fourhanded say you an me agin some
other ducks wed have made four in that deal and histed some
moneyeh and his eyes sparkled Uncle Jim also had a slight
tremulous light in his own

Oh no I didnt see no three crows this afternoon added Uncle Billy
gleefully as his partner in turn began to shuffle the cards with
laborious and conscientious exactitude Then dealing he turned up a
heart for trumps Uncle Billy took up his cards one by one but when
he had finished his face had become as pale as it had been red before
Whats the matter said Uncle Jim quickly his own face growing white

Uncle Billy slowly and with breathless awe laid down his cards face up
on the table It was exactly the same sequence IN HEARTS with the knave
of diamonds added He could again take every trick

They stared at each other with vacant faces and a halfdrawn smile of
fear They could hear the wind moaning in the trees beyond there was a
sudden rattling at the door Uncle Billy started to his feet but Uncle
Jim caught his arm DONT LEAVE THE CARDS Its only the wind sit
down he said in a low awehushed voice its your deal you were two
before and two now that makes your four youve only one point to make
to win the game Go on

They both poured out a cup of whiskey smiling vaguely yet with a
certain terror in their eyes Their hands were cold the cards slipped
from Uncle Billys benumbed fingers when he had shuffled them he passed
them to his partner to shuffle them also but did not speak When Uncle
Jim had shuffled them methodically he handed them back fatefully to his
partner Uncle Billy dealt them with a trembling hand He turned up a
club If you are sure of these tricks you know youve won said Uncle
Jim in a voice that was scarcely audible Uncle Billy did not reply but
tremulously laid down the ace and right and left bowers

He had won

A feeling of relief came over each and they laughed hysterically and
discordantly Ridiculous and childish as their contest might have seemed
to a lookeron to each the tension had been as great as that of the
greatest gambler without the gamblers trained restraint coolness and
composure Uncle Billy nervously took up the cards again

Dont said Uncle Jim gravely its no usethe lucks gone now

Just one more deal pleaded his partner

Uncle Jim looked at the fire Uncle Billy hastily dealt and threw the
two hands face up on the table They were the ordinary average cards
He dealt again with the same result I told you so said Uncle Jim
without looking up

It certainly seemed a tame performance after their wonderful hands and
after another trial Uncle Billy threw the cards aside and drew his stool
before the fire Mighty queer warnt it he said with reminiscent
awe Three times running Do you know I felt a kind o creepy feelin
down my back all the time Criky what luck None of the boys would
believe it if we told emleast of all that Dick Bullen who dont
believe in luck anyway Wonder what hed have said and Lord how hed
have looked Wall what are you starin so for

Uncle Jim had faced around and was gazing at Uncle Billys
goodhumored simple face Nothin he said briefly and his eyes
again sought the fire

Then dont look as if you was seein suthinyou give me the creeps
returned Uncle Billy a little petulantly Lets turn in afore the fire
goes out

The fateful cards were put back into the drawer the table shoved
against the wall The operation of undressing was quickly got over
the clothes they wore being put on top of their blankets Uncle Billy
yawned I wonder what kind of a dream Ill have tonightit oughter be
suthin to explain that luck This was his goodnight to his partner
In a few moments he was sound asleep

Not so Uncle Jim He heard the wind gradually go down and in the
oppressive silence that followed could detect the deep breathing of
his companion and the faroff yelp of a coyote His eyesight becoming
accustomed to the semidarkness broken only by the scintillation of
the dying embers of their fire he could take in every detail of their
sordid cabin and the rude environment in which they had lived so long
The dismal patches on the bark roof the wretched makeshifts of each
day the dreary prolongation of discomfort were all plain to him now
without the sanguine hope that had made them bearable And when he
shut his eyes upon them it was only to travel in fancy down the steep
mountain side that he had trodden so often to the dreary claim on the
overflowed river to the heaps of tailings that encumbered it like
empty shells of the hollow profitless days spent there which they
were always waiting for the stroke of good fortune to clear away He saw
again the rotten sluicing through whose hopeless rifts and holes even
their scant daily earnings had become scantier At last he arose
and with infinite gentleness let himself down from his berth without
disturbing his sleeping partner and wrapping himself in his blanket
went to the door which he noiselessly opened From the position of a
few stars that were glittering in the northern sky he knew that it was
yet scarcely midnight there were still long restless hours before the
day In the feverish state into which he had gradually worked himself it
seemed to him impossible to wait the coming of the dawn

But he was mistaken For even as he stood there all nature seemed to
invade his humble cabin with its free and fragrant breath and invest
him with its great companionship He felt again in that breath that
strange sense of freedom that mystic touch of partnership with the
birds and beasts the shrubs and trees in this greater home before him
It was this vague communion that had kept him there that still held
these worldsick weary workers in their rude cabins on the slopes
around him and he felt upon his brow that balm that had nightly lulled
him and them to sleep and forgetfulness He closed the door turned
away crept as noiselessly as before into his bunk again and presently
fell into a profound slumber

But when Uncle Billy awoke the next morning he saw it was late for
the sun piercing the crack of the closed door was sending a pencil of
light across the cold hearth like a match to rekindle its dead embers
His first thought was of his strange luck the night before and of
disappointment that he had not had the dream of divination that he had
looked for He sprang to the floor but as he stood upright his
glance fell on Uncle Jims bunk It was empty Not only that but his
BLANKETSUncle Jims own particular blanketsWERE GONE

A sudden revelation of his partners manner the night before struck him
now with the cruelty of a blow a sudden intelligence perhaps the very
divination he had sought flashed upon him like lightning He glanced
wildly around the cabin The table was drawn out from the wall a little
ostentatiously as if to catch his eye On it was lying the stained
chamoisskin purse in which they had kept the few grains of gold
remaining from their last weeks clean up The grains had been
carefully divided and half had been taken But near it lay the little
memorandumbook open with the stick of pencil lying across it A deep
line was drawn across the page on which was recorded their imaginary
extravagant gains and losses even to the entry of Uncle Jims half
share of the claim which he had risked and lost Underneath were
hurriedly scrawled the words

Settled by YOUR luck last night old pardJAMES FOSTER


It was nearly a month before Cedar Camp was convinced that Uncle Billy
and Uncle Jim had dissolved partnership Pride had prevented Uncle Billy
from revealing his suspicions of the truth or of relating the events
that preceded Uncle Jims clandestine flight and Dick Bullen had gone
to Sacramento by stagecoach the same morning He briefly gave out that
his partner had been called to San Francisco on important business of
their own that indeed might necessitate his own removal there later In
this he was singularly assisted by a letter from the absent Jim dated
at San Francisco begging him not to be anxious about his success as he
had hopes of presently entering into a profitable business but with no
further allusions to his precipitate departure nor any suggestion of
a reason for it For two or three days Uncle Billy was staggered and
bewildered in his profound simplicity he wondered if his extraordinary
good fortune that night had made him deaf to some explanation of his
partners or more terrible if he had shown some low and incredible
intimation of taking his partners extravagant bet as REAL and binding
In this distress he wrote to Uncle Jim an appealing and apologetic
letter albeit somewhat incoherent and inaccurate and bristling
with misspelling camp slang and old partnership jibes But to this
elaborate epistle he received only Uncle Jims repeated assurances of
his own bright prospects and his hopes that his old partner would be
more fortunate singlehanded on the old claim For a whole week or two
Uncle Billy sulked but his invincible optimism and good humor got the
better of him and he thought only of his old partners good fortune
He wrote him regularly but always to one addressa box at the San
Francisco postoffice which to the simpleminded Uncle Billy suggested
a certain official importance To these letters Uncle Jim responded
regularly but briefly

From a certain intuitive pride in his partner and his affection Uncle
Billy did not show these letters openly to the camp although he spoke
freely of his former partners promising future and even read them
short extracts It is needless to say that the camp did not accept Uncle
Billys story with unsuspecting confidence On the contrary a hundred
surmises humorous or serious but always extravagant were afloat in
Cedar Camp The partners had quarreled over their clothesUncle Jim
who was taller than Uncle Billy had refused to wear his partners
trousers They had quarreled over cardsUncle Jim had discovered that
Uncle Billy was in possession of a cold deck or marked pack They had
quarreled over Uncle Billys carelessness in grinding up half a box
of bilious pills in the mornings coffee A gloomily imaginative
muledriver had darkly suggested that as no one had really seen Uncle
Jim leave the camp he was still there and his bones would yet be found
in one of the ditches while a still more credulous miner averred that
what he had thought was the cry of a screechowl the night previous to
Uncle Jims disappearance might have been the agonized utterance of
that murdered man It was highly characteristic of that campand
indeed of others in Californiathat nobody not even the ingenious
theorists themselves believed their story and that no one took the
slightest pains to verify or disprove it Happily Uncle Billy never
knew it and moved all unconsciously in this atmosphere of burlesque
suspicion And then a singular change took place in the attitude of the
camp towards him and the disrupted partnership Hitherto for no reason
whatever all had agreed to put the blame upon Billypossibly because
he was present to receive it As days passed that slight reticence and
dejection in his manner which they had at first attributed to remorse
and a guilty conscience now began to tell as absurdly in his favor
Here was poor Uncle Billy toiling though the ditches while his selfish
partner was lolling in the lap of luxury in San Francisco Uncle Billys
glowing accounts of Uncle Jims success only contributed to the sympathy
now fully given in his behalf and their execration of the absconding
partner It was proposed at Biggss store that a letter expressing the
indignation of the camp over his heartless conduct to his late partner
William Fall should be forwarded to him Condolences were offered to
Uncle Billy and uncouth attempts were made to cheer his loneliness A
procession of half a dozen men twice a week to his cabin carrying their
own whiskey and winding up with a stag dance before the premises was
sufficient to lighten his eclipsed gayety and remind him of a happier
past Surprise working parties visited his claim with spasmodic essays
towards helping him and great good humor and hilarity prevailed It was
not an unusual thing for an honest miner to arise from an idle gathering
in some cabin and excuse himself with the remark that he reckoned hed
put in an hours work in Uncle Billys tailings And yet as before it
was very improbable if any of these reckless benefactors REALLY believed
in their own earnestness or in the gravity of the situation Indeed a
kind of hopeful cynicism ran through their performances Like as not
Uncle Billy is still in cahoots i e shares with his old pard and
is just laughin at us as hes sendin him accounts of our tomfoolin

And so the winter passed and the rains and the days of cloudless skies
and chill starlit nights began There were still freshets from the snow
reservoirs piled high in the Sierran passes and the Bar was flooded
but that passed too and only the sunshine remained Monotonous as the
seasons were there was a faint movement in the camp with the stirring
of the sap in the pines and cedars And then one day there was a
strange excitement on the Bar Men were seen running hither and thither
but mainly gathering in a crowd on Uncle Billys claim that still
retained the old partners names in The Fall and Foster To add to the
excitement there was the quickly repeated report of a revolver to all
appearance aimlessly exploded in the air by some one on the outskirts
of the assemblage As the crowd opened Uncle Billy appeared pale
hysterical breathless and staggering a little under the backslapping
and handshaking of the whole camp For Uncle Billy had struck it
richhad just discovered a pocket roughly estimated to be worth
fifteen thousand dollars

Although in that supreme moment he missed the face of his old partner
he could not help seeing the unaffected delight and happiness shining
in the eyes of all who surrounded him It was characteristic of that
sanguine but uncertain life that success and good fortune brought no
jealousy nor envy to the unfortunate but was rather a promise
and prophecy of the fulfillment of their own hopes The gold was
thereNature but yielded up her secret There was no prescribed limit
to her bounty So strong was this conviction that a longsuffering but
still hopeful miner in the enthusiasm of the moment stooped down and
patted a large boulder with the apostrophic Good old gal

Then followed a night of jubilee a next morning of hurried consultation
with a mining expert and speculator lured to the camp by the good
tidings and then the very next nightto the utter astonishment of
Cedar CampUncle Billy with a draft for twenty thousand dollars in his
pocket started for San Francisco and took leave of his claim and the
camp forever



When Uncle Billy landed at the wharves of San Francisco he was a little
bewildered The Golden Gate beyond was obliterated by the incoming
seafog which had also roofed in the whole city and lights already
glittered along the gray streets that climbed the grayer sandhills
As a Western man brought up by inland rivers he was fascinated and
thrilled by the tallmasted seagoing ships and he felt a strange sense
of the remoter mysterious ocean which he had never seen But he was
impressed and startled by smartly dressed men and women the passing of
carriages and a sudden conviction that he was strange and foreign to
what he saw It had been his cherished intention to call upon his old
partner in his working clothes and then clap down on the table before
him a draft for ten thousand dollars as HIS share of their old claim
But in the face of these brilliant strangers a sudden and unexpected
timidity came upon him He had heard of a cheap popular hotel much
frequented by the returning goldminer who entered its hospitable
doorswhich held an easy access to shopsand emerged in a few hours
a gorgeous butterfly of fashion leaving his old chrysalis behind him
Thence he inquired his way hence he afterwards issued in garments
glaringly new and ill fitting But he had not sacrificed his beard and
there was still something fine and original in his handsome weak face
that overcame the cheap convention of his clothes Making his way to the
postoffice he was again discomfited by the great size of the building
and bewildered by the array of little square letterboxes behind glass
which occupied one whole wall and an equal number of opaque and locked
wooden ones legibly numbered His heart leaped he remembered the
number and before him was a window with a clerk behind it Uncle Billy
leaned forward

Kin you tell me if the man that box 690 blongs to is in

The clerk stared made him repeat the question and then turned away
But he returned almost instantly with two or three grinning heads
besides his own apparently set behind his shoulders Uncle Billy was
again asked to repeat his question He did so

Why dont you go and see if 690 is in his box said the first clerk
turning with affected asperity to one of the others

The clerk went away returned and said with singular gravity He was
there a moment ago but hes gone out to stretch his legs Its rather
crampin at first and he cant stand it more than ten hours at a time
you know

But simplicity has its limits Uncle Billy had already guessed his
real error in believing his partner was officially connected with the
building his cheek had flushed and then paled again The pupils of his
blue eyes had contracted into suggestive black points Ef youll let
me in at that winder young fellers he said with equal gravity
Ill show yer how I kin make YOU small enough to go in a box without
crampin But I only wanted to know where Jim Foster LIVED

At which the first clerk became perfunctory again but civil A letter
left in his box would get you that information he said and heres
paper and pencil to write it now

Uncle Billy took the paper and began to write Just got here Come and
see me atHe paused A brilliant idea had struck him He could impress
both his old partner and the upstarts at the window he would put in the
name of the latest swell hotel in San Francisco said to be a fairy
dream of opulence He added The Oriental and without folding the
paper shoved it in the window

Dont you want an envelope asked the clerk

Put a stamp on the corner of it responded Uncle Billy laying down a
coin and shell go through The clerk smiled but affixed the stamp
and Uncle Billy turned away

But it was a shortlived triumph The disappointment at finding Uncle
Jims address conveyed no idea of his habitation seemed to remove him
farther away and lose his identity in the great city Besides he must
now make good his own address and seek rooms at the Oriental He went
thither The furniture and decorations even in these early days of
hotelbuilding in San Francisco were extravagant and overstrained
and Uncle Billy felt lost and lonely in his strange surroundings But
he took a handsome suite of rooms paid for them in advance on the spot
and then half frightened walked out of them to ramble vaguely through
the city in the feverish hope of meeting his old partner At night his
inquietude increased he could not face the long row of tables in the
pillared diningroom filled with smartly dressed men and women
he evaded his bedroom with its brocaded satin chairs and its gilt
bedstead and fled to his modest lodgings at the Good Cheer House and
appeased his hunger at its cheap restaurant in the company of retired
miners and freshly arrived Eastern emigrants Two or three days passed
thus in this quaint double existence Three or four times a day he would
enter the gorgeous Oriental with affected ease and carelessness demand
his key from the hotelclerk ask for the letter that did not come go
to his room gaze vaguely from his window on the passing crowd below for
the partner he could not find and then return to the Good Cheer House
for rest and sustenance On the fourth day he received a short note
from Uncle Jim it was couched in his usual sanguine but brief and
businesslike style He was very sorry but important and profitable
business took him out of town but he trusted to return soon and welcome
his old partner He was also for the first time jocose and hoped
that Uncle Billy would not see all the sights before he Uncle Jim
returned Disappointing as this procrastination was to Uncle Billy a
gleam of hope irradiated it the letter had bridged over that gulf which
seemed to yawn between them at the postoffice His old partner had
accepted his visit to San Francisco without question and had alluded to
a renewal of their old intimacy For Uncle Billy with all his trustful
simplicity had been tortured by two harrowing doubts one whether
Uncle Jim in his newfledged smartness as a city mansuch as he
saw in the streetswould care for his rough companionship the other
whether he Uncle Billy ought not to tell him at once of his changed
fortune But like all weak unreasoning men he clung desperately to
a detailhe could not forego his old idea of astounding Uncle Jim by
giving him his share of the strike as his first intimation of it and
he doubted with more reason perhaps if Jim would see him after he
had heard of his good fortune For Uncle Billy had still a frightened
recollection of Uncle Jims sudden stroke for independence and
that rigid punctiliousness which had made him doggedly accept the
responsibility of his extravagant stake at euchre

With a view of educating himself for Uncle Jims company he saw the
sights of San Franciscoas an overgrown and somewhat stupid child
might have seen themwith great curiosity but little contamination or
corruption But I think he was chiefly pleased with watching the arrival
of the Sacramento and Stockton steamers at the wharves in the hope
of discovering his old partner among the passengers on the gangplank
Here with his old superstitious tendency and gamblers instinct he
would augur great success in his search that day if any one of the
passengers bore the least resemblance to Uncle Jim if a man or woman
stepped off first or if he met a single persons questioning eye
Indeed this got to be the real occupation of the day which he would on
no account have omitted and to a certain extent revived each day in
his mind the mornings work of their old partnership He would say to
himself Its time to go and look up Jim and put off what he
was pleased to think were his pleasures until this act of duty was
accomplished

In this singleness of purpose he made very few and no entangling
acquaintances nor did he impart to any one the secret of his fortune
loyally reserving it for his partners first knowledge To a man of
his natural frankness and simplicity this was a great trial and was
perhaps a crucial test of his devotion When he gave up his rooms at
the Orientalas not necessary after his partners absencehe sent
a letter with his humble address to the mysterious lockbox of his
partner without fear or false shame He would explain it all when they
met But he sometimes treated unlucky and returning miners to a dinner
and a visit to the gallery of some theatre Yet while he had an active
sympathy with and understanding of the humblest Uncle Billy who
for many years had done his own and his partners washing scrubbing
mending and cooking and saw no degradation in it was somewhat
inconsistently irritated by menial functions in men and although
he gave extravagantly to waiters and threw a dollar to the
crossingsweeper there was always a certain shy avoidance of them in
his manner Coming from the theatre one night Uncle Billy was however
seriously concerned by one of these crossingsweepers turning hastily
before them and being knocked down by a passing carriage The man rose
and limped hurriedly away but Uncle Billy was amazed and still more
irritated to hear from his companion that this kind of menial occupation
was often profitable and that at some of the principal crossings the
sweepers were already rich men

But a few days later brought a more notable event to Uncle Billy One
afternoon in Montgomery Street he recognized in one of its smartly
dressed frequenters a man who had a few years before been a member of
Cedar Camp Uncle Billys childish delight at this meeting which
seemed to bridge over his old partners absence was however only
half responded to by the exminer and then somewhat satirically In the
fullness of his emotion Uncle Billy confided to him that he was seeking
his old partner Jim Foster and reticent of his own good fortune
spoke glowingly of his partners brilliant expectations but deplored
his inability to find him And just now he was away on important
business I reckon hes got back said the man dryly I didnt know
he had a lockbox at the postoffice but I can give you his other
address He lives at the Presidio at Washerwomans Bay He stopped and
looked with a satirical smile at Uncle Billy But the latter familiar
with Californian miningcamp nomenclature saw nothing strange in it
and merely repeated his companions words

Youll find him there Goodby So long Sorry Im in a hurry said
the exminer and hurried away

Uncle Billy was too delighted with the prospect of a speedy meeting with
Uncle Jim to resent his former associates supercilious haste or even
to wonder why Uncle Jim had not informed him that he had returned It
was not the first time that he had felt how wide was the gulf between
himself and these others and the thought drew him closer to his old
partner as well as his old idea as it was now possible to surprise
him with the draft But as he was going to surprise him in his own
boardinghouseprobably a handsome oneUncle Billy reflected that he
would do so in a certain style

He accordingly went to a livery stable and ordered a landau and pair
with a negro coachman Seated in it in his best and most illfitting
clothes he asked the coachman to take him to the Presidio and leaned
back in the cushions as they drove through the streets with such an
expression of beaming gratification on his goodhumored face that the
passersby smiled at the equipage and its extravagant occupant To them
it seemed the not unusual sight of the successful miner on a spree To
the unsophisticated Uncle Billy their smiling seemed only a natural and
kindly recognition of his happiness and he nodded and smiled back
to them with unsuspecting candor and innocent playfulness These yer
Frisco fellers aint ALL slouches you bet he added to himself half
aloud at the back of the grinning coachman

Their way led through wellbuilt streets to the outskirts or rather
to that portion of the city which seemed to have been overwhelmed by
shifting sanddunes from which halfsubmerged fences and even low
houses barely marked the line of highway The resistless tradewinds
which had marked this change blew keenly in his face and slightly
chilled his ardor At a turn in the road the sea came in sight and
sloping towards it the great Cemetery of Lone Mountain with white
shafts and marbles that glittered in the sunlight like the sails of
ships waiting to be launched down that slope into the Eternal Ocean
Uncle Billy shuddered What if it had been his fate to seek Uncle Jim
there

Dars yar Presidio said the negro coachman a few moments later
pointing with his whip and dars yar Washwomans Bay

Uncle Billy stared A huge quadrangular fort of stone with a flag flying
above its battlements stood at a little distance pressed against the
rocks as if beating back the encroaching surges between him and the
fort but farther inland was a lagoon with a number of dilapidated
rudely patched cabins or cottages like stranded driftwood around its
shore But there was no mansion no block of houses no street not
another habitation or dwelling to be seen

Uncle Billys first shock of astonishment was succeeded by a feeling of
relief He had secretly dreaded a meeting with his old partner in the
haunts of fashion whatever was the cause that made Uncle Jim seek
this obscure retirement affected him but slightly he even was thrilled
with a vague memory of the old shiftless camp they had both abandoned A
certain instincthe knew not why or less still that it might be one of
delicacymade him alight before they reached the first house Bidding
the carriage wait Uncle Billy entered and was informed by a blowzy
Irish laundress at a tub that Jim Foster or Arkansaw Jim lived at
the fourth shanty beyant He was at home for hed shprained his
fut Uncle Billy hurried on stopped before the door of a shanty
scarcely less rude than their old cabin and half timidly pushed it
open A growling voice from within a figure that rose hurriedly
leaning on a stick with an attempt to fly but in the same moment sank
back in a chair with an hysterical laughand Uncle Billy stood in the
presence of his old partner But as Uncle Billy darted forward Uncle
Jim rose again and this time with outstretched hands Uncle Billy
caught them and in one supreme pressure seemed to pour out and
transfuse his whole simple soul into his partners There they swayed
each other backwards and forwards and sideways by their still clasped
hands until Uncle Billy with a glance at Uncle Jims bandaged ankle
shoved him by sheer force down into his chair

Uncle Jim was first to speak Caught b gosh I mighter known youd be
as big a fool as me Look you Billy Fall do you know what youve done
Youve druv me out er the streets whar I was makin an honest livin by
day on three crossins Yes he laughed forgivingly you druv me out
er it by day jest because I reckoned that some time I might run into
your darned fool faceanother laugh and a grasp of the handand
then bgosh not content with ruinin my business BY DAY when I
took to it at night YOU took to goin out at nights too and so put a
stopper on me there Shall I tell you what else you did Well by the
holy poker I owe this sprained foot to your darned foolishness and my
own for it was getting away from YOU one night after the theatre that I
got run into and run over

Ye see he went on unconscious of Uncle Billys paling face and with
a naivete though perhaps not a delicacy equal to Uncle Billys own I
had to play roots on you with that lockbox business and these letters
because I did not want you to know what I was up to for you mightnt
like it and might think it was lowerin to the old firm dont yer
see I wouldnt hev gone into it but I was played out and I dont
mind tellin you NOW old man that when I wrote you that first chipper
letter from the lockbox I hednt eat anythin for two days But its
all right NOW with a laugh Then I got into this businessthinkin
it nothinjest the very last thingand do you know old pard I
couldnt tell anybody but YOUand in fact I kept it jest to tell
youIve made nine hundred and fiftysix dollars Yes sir NINE
HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX DOLLARS solid money in Adams and Cos Bank
just out er my trade

Wot trade asked Uncle Billy

Uncle Jim pointed to the corner where stood a large heavy
crossingsweepers broom That trade

Certingly said Uncle Billy with a quick laugh

Its an outdoor trade said Uncle Jim gravely but with no suggestion
of awkwardness or apology in his manner and thar aint much difference
between sweepin a crossin with a broom and raking over tailing with a
rake ONLYWOT YE GET with a broom YOU HAVE HANDED TO YE and ye dont
have to PICK IT UP AND FISH IT OUT ER the wet rocks and sluicegushin
and its a heap less tiring to the back

Certingly you bet said Uncle Billy enthusiastically yet with a
certain nervous abstraction

Im glad ye say so for yer see I didnt know at first how youd tumble
to my doing it until Id made my pile And ef I hadnt made it I
wouldnt hev set eyes on ye agin old pardnever

Do you mind my runnin out a minit said Uncle Billy rising You
see Ive got a friend waitin for me outsideand I reckonhe
stammeredIll jest run out and send him off so I kin talk comfble
to ye

Ye aint got anybody youre owin money to said Uncle Jim earnestly
anybody follerin you to get paid eh For I kin jest set down right
here and write ye off a check on the bank

No said Uncle Billy He slipped out of the door and ran like a deer
to the waiting carriage Thrusting a twentydollar goldpiece into the
coachmans hand he said hoarsely I aint wantin that kerridge just
now ye ken drive around and hev a private jamboree all by yourself the
rest of the afternoon and then come and wait for me at the top o the
hill yonder

Thus quit of his gorgeous equipage he hurried back to Uncle Jim
grasping his tenthousand dollar draft in his pocket He was nervous he
was frightened but he must get rid of the draft and his story and have
it over But before he could speak he was unexpectedly stopped by Uncle
Jim

Now look yer Billy boy said Uncle Jim I got suthin to say to
yeand I might as well clear it off my mind at once and then we can
start fair agin Now he went on with a half laugh wasnt it enough
for ME to go on pretendin I was rich and doing a big business and
gettin up that lockbox dodge so as ye couldnt find out whar I hung
out and what I was doinwasnt it enough for ME to go on with all this
playactin but YOU you longlegged or nary cuss must get up and go
to lyin and playactin too

ME playactin ME lyin gasped Uncle Billy

Uncle Jim leaned back in his chair and laughed Do you think you could
fool ME Do you think I didnt see through your little game o going
to that swell Oriental jest as if yed made a big strikeand all the
while ye wasnt sleepin or eatin there but jest wrastlin yer hash
and having a roll down at the Good Cheer Do you think I didnt spy on
ye and find that out Oh you longeared jackassrabbit

He laughed until the tears came into his eyes and Uncle Billy laughed
too albeit until the laugh on his face became quite fixed and he was
fain to bury his head in his handkerchief

And yet said Uncle Jim with a deep breath gosh I was
frightedjest for a minit I thought mebbe you HAD made a big
strikewhen I got your first letterand I made up my mind what Id
do And then I remembered you was jest that kind of an open sluice that
couldnt keep anythin to yourself and youd have been sure to have
yelled it out to ME the first thing So I waited And I found you out
you old sinner He reached forward and dug Uncle Billy in the ribs

What WOULD you hev done said Uncle Billy after an hysterical
collapse

Uncle Jims face grew grave again Id hevIdhev clared out Out
er Frisco out er Californy out er Ameriky I couldnt have stud it
Dont think I would hev begrudged ye yer luck No man would have been
gladder than me He leaned forward again and laid his hand caressingly
upon his partners armDont think Id hev wanted to take a penny of
itbut Ithar I COULDNT hev stood up under it To hev had YOU you
that I left behind comin down here rollin in wealth and new partners
and friends and arrive upon meand this shantyandhe threw towards
the corner of the room a terrible gesture none the less terrible
that it was illogical and inconsequent to all that had gone
beforeandandTHAT BROOM

There was a dead silence in the room With it Uncle Billy seemed to feel
himself again transported to the homely cabin at Cedar Camp and that
fateful night with his partners strange determined face before him
as then He even fancied that he heard the roaring of the pines without
and did not know that it was the distant sea

But after a minute Uncle Jim resumed

Of course youve made a little raise somehow or you wouldnt be here

Yes said Uncle Billy eagerly Yes Ive gotHe stopped and
stammered Ive gotafew hundreds

Oh oh said Uncle Jim cheerfully He paused and then added
earnestly I say You aint got left over and above your dd
foolishness at the Oriental as much as five hundred dollars

Ive got said Uncle Billy blushing a little over his first
deliberate and affected lie Ive got at least five hundred and
seventytwo dollars Yes he added tentatively gazing anxiously at his
partner Ive got at least that

Je whillikins said Uncle Jim with a laugh Then eagerly Look here
pard Then were on velvet Ive got NINE hundred put your FIVE with
that and I know a little ranch that we can get for twelve hundred
Thats what Ive been savin up forthats my little game No more
minin for ME Its got a shanty twice as big as our old cabin nigh on
a hundred acres and two mustangs We can run it with two Chinamen and
jest make it howl Wot yer sayeh He extended his hand

Im in said Uncle Billy radiantly grasping Uncle Jims But his
smile faded and his clear simple brow wrinkled in two lines

Happily Uncle Jim did not notice it Now then old pard he said
brightly well have a gay old time tonightone of our jamborees
Ive got some whiskey here and a deck o cards and well have a little
game you understand but not for keeps now No siree well play for
beans

A sudden light illuminated Uncle Billys face again but he said with a
grim desperation Not tonight Ive got to go into town That fren
o mine expects me to go to the theayter dont ye see But Ill be out
tomorrow at sunup and well fix up this thing o the ranch

Seems to me youre kinder stuck on this fren grunted Uncle Jim

Uncle Billys heart bounded at his partners jealousy Nobut I MUST
you know he returned with a faint laugh

I sayit aint a HER is it said Uncle Jim

Uncle Billy achieved a diabolical wink and a creditable blush at his
lie

Billy

Jim

And under cover of this festive gallantry Uncle Billy escaped He ran
through the gathering darkness and toiled up the shifting sands to the
top of the hill where he found the carriage waiting

Wot said Uncle Billy in a low confidential tone to the coachman
wot do you Frisco fellers allow to be the best biggest and riskiest
gamblinsaloon here Suthin hightoned you know

The negro grinned It was the usual case of the extravagant spendthrift
miner though perhaps he had expected a different question and order

Dey is de Polka de El Dorado and de Arcade saloon boss he
said flicking his whip meditatively Most gents from de mines prefer
de Polka for dey is dancing wid de gals frown in But de real prima
facie place for gents who go for buckin agin de tiger and straightout
gamblin is de Arcade

Drive there like thunder said Uncle Billy leaping into the carriage



True to his word Uncle Billy was at his partners shanty early the next
morning He looked a little tired but happy and had brought a draft
with him for five hundred and seventyfive dollars which he explained
was the total of his capital Uncle Jim was overjoyed They would start
for Napa that very day and conclude the purchase of the ranch Uncle
Jims sprained foot was a sufficient reason for his giving up his
present vocation which he could also sell at a small profit His
domestic arrangements were very simple there was nothing to take
with himthere was everything to leave behind And that afternoon at
sunset the two reunited partners were seated on the deck of the Napa
boat as she swung into the stream

Uncle Billy was gazing over the railing with a look of abstracted relief
towards the Golden Gate where the sinking sun seemed to be drawing
towards him in the ocean a golden stream that was forever pouring
from the Bay and the threehilled city beside it What Uncle Billy was
thinking of or what the picture suggested to him did not transpire
for Uncle Jim who emboldened by his holiday was luxuriating in an
evening paper suddenly uttered a longdrawn whistle and moved closer
to his abstracted partner Look yer he said pointing to a paragraph
he had evidently just read just you listen to this and see if we
aint lucky you and me to be jest wot we airtrustin to our own hard
workand not thinkin o strikes and fortins Jest unbutton yer
ears Billy while I reel off this yer thing Ive jest struck in the
paper and see what dd fools some men kin make o themselves And that
theer reporter wot wrote itmust hev seed it reely

Uncle Jim cleared his throat and holding the paper close to his eyes
read aloud slowly

A scene of excitement that recalled the palmy days of 49 was
witnessed last night at the Arcade Saloon A stranger who might have
belonged to that reckless epoch and who bore every evidence of being
a successful Pike County miner out on a spree appeared at one of the
tables with a negro coachman bearing two heavy bags of gold Selecting
a farobank as his base of operations he began to bet heavily and with
apparent recklessness until his play excited the breathless attention
of every one In a few moments he had won a sum variously estimated at
from eighty to a hundred thousand dollars A rumor went round the room
that it was a concerted attempt to break the bank rather than the
drunken freak of a Western miner dazzled by some successful strike
To this theory the mans careless and indifferent bearing towards his
extraordinary gains lent great credence The attempt if such it was
however was unsuccessful After winning ten times in succession the
luck turned and the unfortunate bucker was cleared out not only of
his gains but of his original investment which may be placed roughly
at twenty thousand dollars This extraordinary play was witnessed by a
crowd of excited players who were less impressed by even the magnitude
of the stakes than the perfect sangfroid and recklessness of the
player who it is said at the close of the game tossed a twentydollar
goldpiece to the banker and smilingly withdrew The man was not
recognized by any of the habitues of the place

There said Uncle Jim as he hurriedly slurred over the French
substantive at the close did ye ever see such Godforsaken
foolishness

Uncle Billy lifted his abstracted eyes from the current still pouring
its unreturning gold into the sinking sun and said with a deprecatory
smile Never

Nor even in the days of prosperity that visited the Great Wheat Ranch of
Fall and Foster did he ever tell his secret to his partner




SEE YUP


I dont suppose that his progenitors ever gave him that name or
indeed that it was a NAME at all but it was currently believed
thatas pronounced See UPit meant that lifting of the outer angle
of the eye common to the Mongolian On the other hand I had been told
that there was an old Chinese custom of affixing some motto or legend
or even a sentence from Confucius as a sign above their shops and that
two or more words which might be merely equivalent to Virtue is its
own reward or Riches are deceitful were believed by the simple
Californian miner to be the name of the occupant himself Howbeit See
Yup accepted it with the smiling patience of his race and never
went by any other If one of the tunnelmen always addressed him as
BrigadierGeneral Judge or Commodore it was understood to be
only the American fondness for ironic title and was never used except
in personal conversation In appearance he looked like any other
Chinaman wore the ordinary blue cotton blouse and white drawers of the
Sampan coolie and in spite of the apparent cleanliness and freshness
of these garments always exhaled that singular medicated odorhalf
opium half gingerwhich we recognized as the common Chinese smell

Our first interview was characteristic of his patient quality He had
done my washing for several months but I had never yet seen him
A meeting at last had become necessary to correct his impressions
regarding buttonswhich he had seemed to consider as mere
excrescences to be removed like superfluous dirt from soiled linen
I had expected him to call at my lodgings but he had not yet made his
appearance One day during the noontide recess of the little frontier
school over which I presided I returned rather early Two or three of
the smaller boys who were loitering about the schoolyard disappeared
with a certain guilty precipitation that I suspected for the moment
but which I presently dismissed from my mind I passed through the
empty schoolroom to my desk sat down and began to prepare the coming
lessons Presently I heard a faint sigh Looking up to my intense
concern I discovered a solitary Chinaman whom I had overlooked sitting
in a rigid attitude on a bench with his back to the window He caught my
eye and smiled sadly but without moving

What are you doing here I asked sternly

Me washee shilts me talkee buttons

Oh youre See Yup are you

Allee same John

Well come here

I continued my work but he did not move

Come here hang it Dont you understand

Me shabbee comme yea But me no shabbee Mellican boy who catchee
me allee same YOU comme yeaYOU shabbee

Indignant but believing that the unfortunate man was still in fear
of persecution from the mischievous urchins whom I had evidently just
interrupted I put down my pen and went over to him Here I discovered
to my surprise and mortification that his long pigtail was held hard
and fast by the closed window behind him which the young rascals had
shut down upon it after having first noiselessly fished it outside with
a hook and line I apologized opened the window and released him He
did not complain although he must have been fixed in that uncomfortable
position for some minutes but plunged at once into the business that
brought him there

But WHY didnt you come to my lodgings I asked

He smiled sadly but intelligently

Mishtel Bally Mr Barry my landlord he owce me five dollee fo
washee washee He no payee me He say he knock hellee outee me allee
time I come for payee So me no come HOUSEE me come SCHOOLEE Shabbee
Mellican boy no good but not so big as Mellican man No can hurtee
Chinaman so much Shabbee

Alas I knew that this was mainly true Mr James Barry was an Irishman
whose finer religious feelings revolted against paying money to a
heathen I could not find it in my heart to say anything to See Yup
about the buttons indeed I spoke in complimentary terms about the
gloss of my shirts and I think I meekly begged him to come again for my
washing When I went home I expostulated with Mr Barry but succeeded
only in extracting from him the conviction that I was one of thim black
Republican fellys that worshiped naygurs I had simply made an enemy of
him But I did not know that at the same time I had made a friend of
See Yup

I became aware of this a few days later by the appearance on my desk of
a small pot containing a specimen of camellia japonica in flower I knew
the schoolchildren were in the habit of making presents to me in this
furtive fashionleaving their own nosegays of wild flowers or perhaps
a cluster of roses from their parents gardensbut I also knew that
this exotic was too rare to come from them I remembered that See Yup
had a Chinese taste for gardening and a friend another Chinaman who
kept a large nursery in the adjoining town But my doubts were set at
rest by the discovery of a small roll of red ricepaper containing my
washingbill fastened to the camellia stalk It was plain that this
mingling of business and delicate gratitude was clearly See Yups
own idea As the finest flower was the topmost one I plucked it for
wearing when I found to my astonishment that it was simply wired to
the stalk This led me to look at the others which I found also wired
More than that they seemed to be an inferior flower and exhaled that
cold earthy odor peculiar to the camellia even as I thought to an
excess A closer examination resulted in the discovery that with the
exception of the first flower I had plucked they were one and all
ingeniously constructed of thin slices of potato marvelously cut to
imitate the vegetable waxiness and formality of the real flower The
work showed an infinite and almost pathetic patience in detail
yet strangely incommensurate with the result admirable as it was
Nevertheless this was also like See Yup But whether he had tried to
deceive me or whether he only wished me to admire his skill I could
not say And as his persecution by my scholars had left a balance of
consideration in his favor I sent him a warm note of thanks and said
nothing of my discovery

As our acquaintance progressed I became frequently the recipient of
other small presents from him a pot of preserves of a quality I could
not purchase in shops and whose contents in their crafty gingery
dissimulation so defied definition that I never knew whether they were
animal vegetable or mineral two or three hideous Chinese idols for
luckee and a diabolical firework with an irregular spasmodic activity
that would sometimes be prolonged until the next morning In return I
gave him some apparently hopeless oral lessons in English and certain
sentences to be copied which he did with marvelous precision I
remember one instance when this peculiar faculty of imitation was
disastrous in result In setting him a copy I had blurred a word which
I promptly erased and then traced the letters more distinctly over the
scratched surface To my surprise See Yup triumphantly produced HIS
copy with the erasion itself carefully imitated and in fact much more
neatly done than mine

In our confidential intercourse I never seemed to really get nearer
to him His sympathy and simplicity appeared like his flowersto be a
goodhumored imitation of my own I am satisfied that his particularly
soulless laugh was not derived from any amusement he actually felt yet
I could not say it was forced In his accurate imitations I fancied he
was only trying to evade any responsibility of his own THAT devolved
upon his taskmaster In the attention he displayed when new ideas
were presented to him there was a slight condescension as if he were
looking down upon them from his three thousand years of history

Dont you think the electric telegraph wonderful I asked one day

Very good for Mellican man he said with his aimless laugh plenty
makee him jump

I never could tell whether he had confounded it with electrogalvanism
or was only satirizing our American haste and feverishness He was
capable of either For that matter we knew that the Chinese themselves
possessed some means of secretly and quickly communicating with one
another Any news of good or ill import to their race was quickly
disseminated through the settlement before WE knew anything about it An
innocent basket of clothes from the wash sent up from the riverbank
became in some way a library of information a single slip of
ricepaper aimlessly fluttering in the dust of the road had the
mysterious effect of diverging a whole gang of coolie tramps away from
our settlement

When See Yup was not subject to the persecutions of the more ignorant
and brutal he was always a source of amusement to all and I cannot
recall an instance when he was ever taken seriously The miners found
diversions even in his alleged frauds and trickeries whether innocent
or retaliatory and were fond of relating with great gusto his evasion
of the Foreign Miners Tax This was an oppressive measure aimed
principally at the Chinese who humbly worked the wornout tailings of
their Christian fellow miners It was stated that See Yup knowing the
difficultyalready alluded toof identifying any particular Chinaman
by NAME conceived the additional idea of confusing recognition by
intensifying the monotonous facial expression Having paid his tax
himself to the collector he at once passed the receipt to his fellows
so that the collector found himself confronted in different parts of the
settlement with the receipt and the aimless laugh of apparently See
Yup himself Although we all knew that there were a dozen Chinamen or
more at work at the mines the collector never was able to collect the
tax from more than TWOSee Yup and one See Yinand so great was
THEIR facial resemblance that the unfortunate official for a long time
hugged himself with the conviction that he had made See Yup PAY TWICE
and withheld the money from the government It is very probable that the
Californians recognition of the sanctity of a joke and his belief that
cheating the government was only cheating himself largely accounted
for the sympathies of the rest of the miners

But these sympathies were not always unanimous

One evening I strolled into the barroom of the principal saloon which
so far as mere upholstery and comfort went was also the principal house
in the settlement The first rains had commenced the windows were open
for the influence of the southwest trades penetrated even this faroff
mountain mining settlement but oddly enough there was a fire in the
large central stove around which the miners had collected with their
steaming boots elevated on a projecting iron railing that encircled it
They were not attracted by the warmth but the stove formed a social
pivot for gossip and suggested that mystic circle dear to the
gregarious instinct Yet they were decidedly a despondent group For
some moments the silence was only broken by a gasp a sigh a muttered
oath or an impatient change of position There was nothing in the
fortunes of the settlement nor in their own individual affairs to
suggest this gloom The singular truth was that they were one and all
suffering from the pangs of dyspepsia

Incongruous as such a complaint might seem to their healthy
environmenttheir outdoor life their daily exercise the healing
balsam of the mountain air their enforced temperance in diet and
the absence of all enervating pleasuresit was nevertheless the
incontestable fact Whether it was the result of the nervous excitable
temperament which had brought them together in this feverish hunt for
gold whether it was the quality of the tinned meats or halfcooked
provisions they hastily bolted begrudging the time it took to prepare
and to consume them whether they too often supplanted their meals by
tobacco or whiskey the singular physiological truth remained that these
young finely selected adventurers living the lives of the natural
aboriginal man and looking the picture of health and strength actually
suffered more from indigestion than the pampered dwellers of the cities
The quantity of patent medicines bitters pills panaceas
and lozenges sold in the settlement almost exceeded the amount of
the regular provisions whose effects they were supposed to correct
The sufferers eagerly scanned advertisements and placards There
were occasional runs on new specifics and general conversation
eventually turned into a discussion of their respective merits A
certain childlike faith and trust in each new remedy was not the least
distressing and pathetic of the symptoms of these grownup bearded men

Well gentlemen said Cyrus Parker glancing around at his fellow
sufferers ye kin talk of your patent medicines and Ive tackled em
all but only the other day I struck suthin that Im goin to hang on
to you bet

Every eye was turned moodily to the speaker but no one said anything

And I didnt get it outer advertisements nor off of circulars I got
it outer my head just by solid thinking continued Parker

What was it Cy said one unsophisticated and inexperienced sufferer

Instead of replying Parker like a true artist knowing he had the ear
of his audience dramatically flashed a question upon them

Did you ever hear of a Chinaman having dyspepsy

Never heard he had sabe enough to hev ANYTHING said a scorner

No but DID ye insisted Parker

Well no chorused the group They were evidently struck with the
fact

Of course you didnt said Parker triumphantly Cos they AINT
Well gentlemen it didnt seem to me the square thing that a pesky lot
o yellowskinned heathens should be built different to a white man
and never know the tortur that a Christian feels and one day arter
dinner when I was just alyin flat down on the bank squirmin and
clutching the short grass to keep from yellin who should go by but
that pizened See Yup with a grin on his face

Mellican man plenty playee to him Joss after eatin sez he but
Chinaman smellee punk allee same and no hab got

I knew the slimy cuss was just purtendin he thought I was prayin to
my Joss but I was that weak I hadnt strenth boys to heave a rock at
him Yet it gave me an idea

What was it they asked eagerly

I went down to his shop the next day when he was alone and I was
feeling mighty bad and I got hold of his pigtail and I allowed Id
stuff it down his throat if he didnt tell me what he meant Then he
took a piece of punk and lit it and put it under my nose and darn my
skin gentlemen you mighnt believe me but in a minute I felt better
and after a whiff or two I was all right

Was it powful strong Cy asked the inexperienced one

No said Parker and thats just whats got me It was a sort o
dreamy spicy smell like a hot night But as I couldnt go round mong
you boys with a lighted piece o punk in my hand ez if I was settin
off Fourth of July firecrackers I asked him if he couldnt fix me up
suthin in another shape that would be handier to use when I was took
bad and Id reckon to pay him for it like ez Id pay for any other
patent medicine So he fixed me up this

He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small red paper which
when opened disclosed a pink powder It was gravely passed around the
group

Why it smells and tastes like ginger said one

It is only ginger said another scornfully

Mebbe it is and mebbe it isnt returned Cy Parker stoutly Mebbe
uts only my fancy But if its the sort o stuff to bring on that
fancy and that fancy CURES me its all the same Ive got about two
dollars worth o that fancy or that ginger and Im going to stick to
it You hear me And he carefully put it back in his pocket

At which criticisms and gibes broke forth If he Cy Parker a white
man was going to demean himself by consulting a Chinese quack hed
better buy up a lot o idols and stand em up around his cabin If he
had that sort o confidences with See Yup he ought to go to work with
him on his cheap tailings and be fumigated all at the same time If
hed been smoking an opium pipe instead of smelling punk he ought to
be man enough to confess it Yet it was noticeable that they were
all very anxious to examine the packet again but Cy Parker was alike
indifferent to demand or entreaty

A few days later I saw Abe Wynford one of the party coming out of See
Yups washhouse He muttered something in passing about the infamous
delay in sending home his washing but did not linger long in
conversation The next day I met another miner AT the washhouse but HE
lingered so long on some trifling details that I finally left him there
alone with See Yup When I called upon Poker Jack of Shasta there was a
singular smell of incense in HIS cabin which he attributed to the very
resinous quality of the fir logs he was burning I did not attempt
to probe these mysteries by any direct appeal to See Yup himself I
respected his reticence indeed if I had not I was quite satisfied
that he would have lied to me Enough that his washhouse was well
patronized and he was decidedly getting on

It might have been a month afterwards that Dr Duchesne was setting a
broken bone in the settlement and after the operation was over had
strolled into the Palmetto Saloon He was an old army surgeon much
respected and loved in the district although perhaps a little feared
for the honest roughness and military precision of his speech After he
had exchanged salutations with the miners in his usual hearty fashion
and accepted their invitation to drink Cy Parker with a certain
affected carelessness which did not however conceal a singular
hesitation in his speech began

Ive been wantin to ask ye a question Doca sort o darned fool
question ye knownothing in the way of consultation dont you see
though its kin er in the way o your purfeshun Sabe

Go on Cy said the doctor goodhumoredly this is my dispensary
hour

Oh it aint anything about symptoms Doc and there aint anything the
matter with me Its only just to ask ye if ye happened to know anything
about the medical practice of these yer Chinamen

I dont know said the doctor bluntly and I dont know ANYBODY who
does

There was a sudden silence in the bar and the doctor putting down his
glass continued with slight professional precision

You see the Chinese know nothing of anatomy from personal observation
Autopsies and dissection are against their superstitions which declare
the human body sacred and are consequently never practiced

There was a slight movement of inquiring interest among the party
and Cy Parker after a meaning glance at the others went on half
aggressively half apologetically

In course they aint surgeons like you Doc but that dont keep them
from having their own little medicines just as dogs eat grass you
know Now I want to put it to you as a farminded man if you mean ter
say that jest because those old women who sarve out yarbs and spring
medicines in families dont know anything of anatomy they aint fit to
give us their simple and natral medicines

But the Chinese medicines are not simple or natural said the doctor
coolly

Not simple echoed the party closing round him

I dont mean to say continued the doctor glancing around at their
eager excited faces with an appearance of wonder that they are
positively noxious unless taken in large quantities for they are not
drugs at all but I certainly should not call them simple Do YOU know
what they principally are

Well no said Parker cautiously perhaps not EXACTLY

Come a little closer and Ill tell you

Not only Parkers head but the others were bent over the counter Dr
Duchesne uttered a few words in a tone inaudible to the rest of the
company There was a profound silence broken at last by Abe Wynfords
voice

Ye kin pour me out about three fingers o whiskey Barkeep Ill take
it straight

Same to me said the others

The men gulped down their liquor two of them quietly passed out The
doctor wiped his lips buttoned his coat and began to draw on his
ridinggloves

Ive heerd said Poker Jack of Shasta with a faint smile on his white
face as he toyed with the last drops of liquor in his glass that the
darned fools sometimes smell punk as a medicine eh

Yes THATS comparatively decent said the doctor reflectively Its
only sawdust mixed with a little gum and formic acid

Formic acid Wots that

A very peculiar acid secreted by ants It is supposed to be used by
them offensively in warfarejust as the skunk eh

But Poker Jack of Shasta had hurriedly declared that he wanted to speak
to a man who was passing and had disappeared The doctor walked to the
door mounted his horse and rode away I noticed however that there
was a slight smile on his bronzed impassive face This led me to
wonder if he was entirely ignorant of the purpose for which he had been
questioned and the effect of his information I was confirmed in the
belief by the remarkable circumstances that nothing more was said of it
the incident seemed to have terminated there and the victims made no
attempt to revenge themselves on See Yup That they had one and all
secretly and unknown to one another patronized him there was no doubt
but at the same time as they evidently were not sure that Dr Duchesne
had not hoaxed them in regard to the quality of See Yups medicines
they knew that an attack on the unfortunate Chinaman would in either
case reveal their secret and expose them to the ridicule of their
brother miners So the matter dropped and See Yup remained master of
the situation

Meantime he was prospering The coolie gang he worked on the river when
not engaged in washing clothes were picking over the tailings
or refuse of gravel left on abandoned claims by successful miners
As there was no more expense attending this than in stonebreaking or
ragpicking and the feeding of the coolies which was ridiculously
cheap there was no doubt that See Yup was reaping a fair weekly return
from it but as he sent his receipts to San Francisco through coolie
managers after the Chinese custom and did not use the regular Express
Company there was no way of ascertaining the amount Again neither
See Yup nor his fellow countrymen ever appeared to have any money about
them In ruder times and more reckless camps raids were often made by
ruffians on their cabins or their traveling gangs but never with any
pecuniary result This condition however it seemed was destined to
change

One Saturday See Yup walked into Wells Fargo  Cos Express office
with a package of golddust which when duly weighed was valued at
five hundred dollars It was consigned to a Chinese company in San
Francisco When the clerk handed See Yup a receipt he remarked
casually

Washing seems to pay See Yup

Washee velly good pay You wantee washee John said See Yup eagerly

No no said the clerk with a laugh I was only thinking five
hundred dollars would represent the washing of a good many shirts

No leplesent washee shirts at all Catchee golddust when washee
tailings Shabbee

The clerk DID shabbee and lifted his eyebrows The next Saturday See
Yup appeared with another package worth about four hundred dollars
directed to the same consignee

Didnt pan out quite so rich this week eh said the clerk engagingly

No returned See Yup impassively next time he payee more

When the third Saturday came with the appearance of See Yup and four
hundred and fifty dollars worth of golddust the clerk felt he was no
longer bound to keep the secret He communicated it to others and
in twentyfour hours the whole settlement knew that See Yups coolie
company were taking out an average of four hundred dollars per week from
the refuse and tailings of the old abandoned Palmetto claim

The astonishment of the settlement was profound In earlier days
jealousy and indignation at the success of these degraded heathens might
have taken a more active and aggressive shape and it would have fared
ill with See Yup and his companions But the settlement had become more
prosperous and lawabiding there were one or two Eastern families and
some foreign capital already there and its jealousy and indignation
were restricted to severe investigation and legal criticism Fortunately
for See Yup it was an oldestablished mining law that an abandoned
claim and its tailings became the property of whoever chose to work
it But it was alleged that See Yups company had in reality struck a
leaddiscovered a hitherto unknown vein or original deposit of gold
not worked by the previous company and having failed legally to declare
it by preemption and public registry in their foolish desire for
secrecy had thus forfeited their right to the property A surveillance
of their working however did not establish this theory the gold that
See Yup had sent away was of the kind that might have been found in the
tailings overlooked by the late Palmetto owners Yet it was a very large
yield for mere refuse

Them Palmetto boys were mighty keerless after theyd made their big
strike and got to work on the vein and I reckon they threw a lot
of gold away said Cy Parker who remembered their largehanded
recklessness in the flush days Ony that WE didnt think it was
white mans work to rake over another mans leavins we might hev had
what them derned Chinamen hev dropped into Tell ye what boys weve
been a little too high and mighty and well hev to climb down

At last the excitement reached its climax and diplomacy was employed to
effect what neither intimidation nor espionage could secure Under the
pretense of desiring to buy out See Yups company a select committee of
the miners was permitted to examine the property and its workings They
found the great bank of stones and gravel representing the castout
debris of the old claim occupied by See Yup and four or five plodding
automatic coolies At the end of two hours the committee returned to
the saloon bursting with excitement They spoke under their breath but
enough was gathered to satisfy the curious crowd that See Yups pile of
tailings was rich beyond their expectations The committee had seen with
their own eyes gold taken out of the sand and gravel to the amount of
twenty dollars in the two short hours of their examination And the work
had been performed in the stupidest clumsiest yet PATIENT Chinese way
What might not white men do with better appointed machinery A syndicate
was at once formed See Yup was offered twenty thousand dollars if
he would sell out and put the syndicate in possession of the claim
in twentyfour hours The Chinaman received the offer stolidly As he
seemed inclined to hesitate I am grieved to say that it was intimated
to him that if he declined he might be subject to embarrassing and
expensive legal proceedings to prove his property and that companies
would be formed to prospect the ground on either side of his heap of
tailings See Yup at last consented with the proviso that the money
should be paid in gold into the hands of a Chinese agent in San
Francisco on the day of the delivery of the claim The syndicate made
no opposition to this characteristic precaution of the Chinaman It
was like them not to travel with money and the implied uncomplimentary
suspicion of danger from the community was overlooked See Yup departed
the day that the syndicate took possession He came to see me before he
went I congratulated him upon his good fortune at the same time I was
embarrassed by the conviction that he was unfairly forced into a sale of
his property at a figure far below its real value

I think differently now

At the end of the week it was said that the new company cleared up
about three hundred dollars This was not so much as the community
had expected but the syndicate was apparently satisfied and the new
machinery was put up At the end of the next week the syndicate were
silent as to their returns One of them made a hurried visit to San
Francisco It was said that he was unable to see either See Yup or the
agent to whom the money was paid It was also noticed that there was no
Chinaman remaining in the settlement Then the fatal secret was out

The heap of tailings had probably never yielded the See Yup company more
than twenty dollars a week the ordinary wage of such a company See Yup
had conceived the brilliant idea of booming it on a borrowed capital
of five hundred dollars in golddust which he OPENLY transmitted by
express to his confederate and creditor in San Francisco who in turn
SECRETLY sent it back to See Yup by coolie messengers to be again
openly transmitted to San Francisco The package of golddust was thus
passed backwards and forwards between debtor and creditor to the
grave edification of the Express Company and the fatal curiosity of the
settlement When the syndicate had gorged the bait thus thrown out See
Yup on the day the selfinvited committee inspected the claim promptly
salted the tailings by CONSCIENTIOUSLY DISTRIBUTING THE GOLDDUST OVER
IT so deftly that it appeared to be its natural composition and yield

I have only to bid farewell to See Yup and close this reminiscence of
a misunderstood man by adding the opinion of an eminent jurist in San
Francisco to whom the facts were submitted So clever was this alleged
fraud that it is extremely doubtful if an action would lie against See
Yup in the premises there being no legal evidence of the salting
and none whatever of his actual allegation that the golddust was the
ORDINARY yield of the tailings that implication resting entirely with
the committee who examined it under false pretense and who subsequently
forced the sale by intimidation




THE DESBOROUGH CONNECTIONS


Then it isnt a question of property or next of kin said the consul

Lord no said the lady vivaciously Why goodness me I reckon
old Desborough could at any time before he died have bought up or
bought out the whole lot of his relatives on this side of the
big pond no matter what they were worth No its only a matter of
curiosity and just sociableness

The American consul at St Kentigorn felt much relieved He had feared
it was only the old story of delusive quests for imaginary estates and
impossible inheritances which he had confronted so often in nervous
waneyed enthusiasts and obstreperous claimants from his own land
Certainly there was no suggestion of this in the richly dressed and
bediamonded matron before him nor in her pretty daughter charming in
a Paris frock alive with the consciousness of beauty and admiration
and yet a little ennuye from gratified indulgence He knew the mother to
be the wealthy widow of a New York millionaire that she was traveling
for pleasure in Europe and a chance meeting with her at dinner a
few nights before had led to this halfcapricious halfconfidential
appointment at the consulate

No continued Mrs Desborough Mr Desborough came to America when
a small boy with an uncle who died some years ago Mr Desborough never
seemed to hanker much after his English relatives as long as I knew him
but now that I and Sadie are over here why we guessed we might look em
up and sort of sample em Desborough s rather a good name added
the lady with a complacency that however had a suggestion of query in
it

Yes said the consul from the French I fancy

Mr Desborough was Englishvery English corrected the lady

I mean it may be an old Norman name said the consul

Normans good enough for ME said the daughter reflecting Well
just settle it as Norman I never thought about that DES

Only you may find it called Debborough here and spelt so said the
consul smiling

Miss Desborough lifted her pretty shoulders and made a charming grimace
Then we wont acknowledge em No Debborough for me

You might put an advertisement in the papers like the next of
kin notice intimating in the regular way that they would hear of
something to their advantageas they certainly would continued the
consul with a bow It would be such a refreshing change to the kind
of thing Im accustomed to dont you knowthis idea of one of my
countrywomen coming over just to benefit English relatives By Jove I
wouldnt mind undertaking the whole thing for youits such a novelty
He was quite carried away with the idea

But the two ladies were far from participating in this joyous outlook
No said Mrs Desborough promptly that wouldnt do You see she
went on with superb frankness that would be just giving ourselves
away and saying who WE were before we found out what THEY were like
Mr Desborough was all right in HIS way but we dont know anything
about his FOLKS We aint here on a mission to improve the Desboroughs
nor to gather in any lost tribes

It was evident that in spite of the humor of the situation and the
levity of the ladies there was a characteristic national practicalness
about them and the consul with a sigh at last gave the address of one
or two responsible experts in genealogical inquiry as he had often
done before He felt it was impossible to offer any advice to ladies
as thoroughly capable of managing their own affairs as his fair
countrywomen yet he was not without some curiosity to know the result
of their practical sentimental quest That he should ever hear of them
again he doubted He knew that after their first loneliness had worn off
in their gregarious gathering at a London hotel they were not likely to
consort with their own country people who indeed were apt to fight
shy of one another and even to indulge in invidious criticism of one
another when admitted in that society to which they were all equally
strangers So he took leave of them on their way back to London with the
belief that their acquaintance terminated with that brief incident But
he was mistaken

In the year following he was spending his autumn vacation at a
country house It was an historic house and had always struck him as
beingeven in that country of historic seatsa singular example of the
vicissitudes of English manorial estates and the mutations of its
lords His host in his prime had been recalled from foreign service
to unexpectedly succeed to an uncles title and estate That estate
however had come into the possession of the uncle only through his
marriage with the daughter of an old family whose portraits still looked
down from the walls upon the youngest and alien branch There were
likenesses effigies memorials and reminiscences of still older
families who had occupied it through forfeiture by war or the favoritism
of kings and in its stately cloisters and ruined chapel was still felt
the dead hand of its evicted religious founders which could not be
shaken off

It was this strange individuality that affected all who saw it For
however changed were those within its walls whoever were its inheritors
or inhabiters Scrooby Priory never changed nor altered its own
character However incongruous or illassorted the portraits that looked
from its wallsso ill met that they might have flown at one anothers
throats in the long nights when the family were awaythe great
house itself was independent of them all The bewigged belaced and
befurbelowed of one days gathering the roundheaded steelfronted
and primkerchiefed congregation of another day and even the
blackcoated barearmed and bareshouldered assemblage of today had
no effect on the austerities of the Priory Modern houses might show
the tastes and prepossessions of their dwellers might have caught some
passing trick of the hour or have recorded the augmented fortunes or
luxuriousness of the owner but Scrooby Priory never No one had dared
even to disturb its outer rigid integrity the breaches of time and
siege were left untouched It held its calm indifferent sway over all
who passed its lowarched portals and the consul was fain to believe
that hea foreign visitorwas no more alien to the house than its
present owner

Im expecting a very charming compatriot of yours tomorrow said Lord
Beverdale as they drove from the station together You must tell me
what to show her

I should think any countrywoman of mine would be quite satisfied with
the Priory said the consul glancing thoughtfully towards the pile
dimly seen through the park

I shouldnt like her to be bored here continued Beverdale Algy met
her at Rome where she was occupying a palace with her mothertheyre
very rich you know He found she was staying with Lady Minever at
Hedham Towers and I went over and invited her with a little party
Shes a Miss Desborough

The consul gave a slight start and was aware that Beverdale was looking
at him

Perhaps you know her said Beverdale

Just enough to agree with you that she is charming said the consul
I dined with them and saw them at the consulate

Oh yes I always forget you are a consul Then of course you know
all about them I suppose theyre very rich and in society over there
said Beverdale in a voice that was quite animated

It was on the consuls lips to say that the late Mr Desborough was an
Englishman and even to speak playfully of their proposed quest but a
sudden instinct withheld him After all perhaps it was only a caprice
or idea they had forgottenperhaps who knowsthat they were
already ashamed of They had evidently got on in English society if
that was their real intent and doubtless Miss Desborough by this time
was quite as content with the chance of becoming related to the Earl of
Beverdale through his son and heir Algernon as if they had found a
real Lord Desborough among their own relatives The consul knew that
Lord Beverdale was not a rich man that like most men of old family he
was not a slave to class prejudice indeed the consul had seen very few
noblemen off the stage or out of the pages of a novel who were So he
said with a slight affectation of authority that there was as
little doubt of the young ladys wealth as there was of her personal
attractions

They were nearing the house through a long avenue of chestnuts whose
variegated leaves were already beginning to strew the ground beneath
and they could see the vista open upon the mullioned windows of the
Priory lighted up by the yellow October sunshine In that sunshine
stood a tall cleanlimbed young fellow dressed in a shootingsuit
whom the consul recognized at once as Lord Algernon the son of his
companion As if to accent the graces of this vision of youth and vigor
near him in the shadow an old man had halted hat in hand still
holding the rake with which he had been gathering the dead leaves in the
avenue his back bent partly with years partly with the obeisance of
a servitor There was something so marked in this contrast in this
old man standing in the shadow of the fading year himself as dried and
withered as the leaves he was raking yet pausing to make his reverence
to this passing sunshine of youth and prosperity in the presence of his
coming master that the consul as they swept by looked after him with
a stirring of pain

Rather an old man to be still at work said the consul

Beverdale laughed You must not let him hear you say so he considers
himself quite as fit as any younger man in the place and by Jove
though hes nearly eighty Im inclined to believe it Hes not one of
our people however he comes from the village and is taken on at odd
times partly to please himself His great aim is to be independent of
his childrenhe has a granddaughter who is one of the maids at the
Prioryand to keep himself out of the workhouse He does not come from
these partssomewhere farther north I fancy But hes a tough lot and
has a deal of work in him yet

Seems to be going a bit stale lately said Lord Algernon and I think
is getting a little queer in his head He has a trick of stopping and
staring straight ahead at times when he seems to go off for a minute
or two There continued the young man with a light laugh I say
hes doing it now They both turned quickly and gazed at the bent
figurenot fifty yards awaystanding in exactly the same attitude as
before But even as they gazed he slowly lifted his rake and began his
monotonous work again

At Scrooby Priory the consul found that the fame of his fair
countrywoman had indeed preceded her and that the other guests were
quite as anxious to see Miss Desborough as he was One of them had
already met her in London another knew her as one of the house party at
the Duke of Northforelands where she had been a central figure Some
of her naive sallies and frank criticisms were repeated with great
unction by the gentlemen and with some slight trepidation and a
fearful joy by the ladies He was more than ever convinced that mother
and daughter had forgotten their lineal Desboroughs and he resolved to
leave any allusion to it to the young lady herself

She however availed herself of that privilege the evening after her
arrival Whod have thought of meeting YOU here she said sweeping
her skirts away to make room for him on a sofa Its a coons age
since I saw younot since you gave us that letter to those genealogical
gentlemen in London

The consul hoped that it had proved successful

Yes but maw guessed we didnt care to go back to Hengist and Horsa
and when they let loose a lot of Debboroughs and Daybrooks upon us
maw kicked Weve got a drawing ten yards long that looks like a sour
apple tree with lots of Desboroughs hanging up on the branches like
last years pippins and I guess about as wormeaten We took that well
enough but when it came to giving us a map of straight lines and dashes
with names written under them like an old Morse telegraph slip struck
by lightning then maw and I guessed that it made us tired

You know she went on opening her clear gray eyes on the consul with
a characteristic flash of shrewd good sense through her quaint humor
we never reckoned where this thing would land us and we found we
were paying a hundred pounds not only for the Desboroughs but all the
people theyd MARRIED and their CHILDREN and childrens children and
there were a lot of outsiders wed never heard of nor wanted to hear
of Maw once thought shed got on the trail of a Plantagenet and
followed it keen until she found she had been reading the dreadful
thing upside down Then we concluded we wouldnt take any more stock in
the family until it had risen

During this speech the consul could not help noticing that although her
attitude was playfully confidential to him her voice really was pitched
high enough to reach the ears of smaller groups around her who were not
only following her with the intensest admiration but had shamelessly
abandoned their own conversation and had even faced towards her Was
she really posing in her naivete There was a certain mischievous
even aggressive consciousness in her pretty eyelids Then she suddenly
dropped both eyes and voice and said to the consul in a genuine aside
I like this sort of thing much better

The consul looked puzzled What sort of thing

Why all these swell people dont you see those pictures on the
walls this elegant room everything that has come down from the past
all ready and settled for you you knowages ago Something you havent
to pick up for yourself and worry over

But here the consul pointed out that the place itself was not
ancestral as regarded the present earl and that even the original
title of his predecessors had passed away from it In fact it came
into the family by one of those outsiders you deprecate But I dare
say youd find the place quite as comfortable with Lord Beverdale for a
host as you would if you had found out he were a cousin he added

Better said the young lady frankly

I suppose your mother participates in these preferences said the
consul with a smile

No said Miss Desborough with the same frankness I think maws
rather cut up at not finding a Desborough She was invited down here
but SHES rather independent you know so she allowed I could take care
of myself while she went off to stay with the old Dowager Lady Mistowe
who thinks maw a very proper womanly person I made maw mad by telling
her thats just what old Lady Mistowe would say of her cookfor I cant
stand these peoples patronage However I shouldnt wonder if I was
invited here as a most original person

But here Lord Algernon came up to implore her to sing them one of those
plantation songs and Miss Desborough with scarcely a change of voice
or manner allowed herself to be led to the piano The consul had
little chance to speak with her again but he saw enough that evening to
convince him not only that Lord Algernon was very much in love with
her but that the fact had been equally and complacently accepted by the
family and guests That her present visit was only an opportunity for a
formal engagement was clear to every woman in the housenot excepting
I fear even the fair subject of gossip herself Yet she seemed so
unconcerned and selfcontained that the consul wondered if she really
cared for Lord Algernon And having thus wondered he came to the
conclusion that it didnt much matter for the happiness of so
practically organized a young lady if she loved him or not

It is highly probable that Miss Sadie Desborough had not even gone so
far as to ask herself that question She awoke the next morning with a
sense of easy victory and calm satisfaction that had however none of
the transports of affection Her taste was satisfied by the love of
a handsome young fellowa typical Englishmanwho if not exactly
original or ideal was she felt of an universally accepted
hallmarked standard the legitimate outcome of a highly ordered
carefully guarded civilization whose repose was the absence of struggle
or ambition a man whose regular features were not yet differentiated
from the rest of his class by any of those disturbing lines which people
call character Everything was made ready for her without care or
preparation she had not even an ideal to realize or to modify She
could slip without any jar or dislocation into this life which was just
saved from selfindulgence and sybaritic luxury by certain conventional
rules of activity and the occupation of amusement which as obligations
of her position even appeared to suggest the novel aspect of a DUTY
She could accept all this without the sense of being an intruder in
an unbroken lineagethanks to the consuls account of the Beverdales
inheritance She already pictured herself as the mistress of this fair
domain the custodian of its treasures and traditions and the dispenser
of its hospitalities butas she conscientiously believedwithout
pride or vanity in her position only an intense and thoughtful
appreciation of it Nor did she dream of ever displaying it
ostentatiously before her less fortunate fellow countrywomen on the
contrary she looked forward to their possible criticism of her casting
off all transatlantic ties with an uneasy consciousness that was perhaps
her nearest approach to patriotism Yet again she reasoned that as
her father was an Englishman she was only returning to her old home
As to her mother she had already comforted herself by noticing certain
discrepancies in that ladys temperament which led her to believe that
she herself alone inherited her fathers naturefor her mother was of
course distinctly American So little conscious was she of any possible
snobbishness in this belief that in her superb naivete she would have
argued the point with the consul and employed a wit and dialect that
were purely American

She had slipped out of the Priory early that morning that she might
enjoy alone unattended and unciceroned the aspect of that vast estate
which might be hers for the mere accepting Perhaps there was some
instinct of delicacy in her avoiding Lord Algernon that morning not
wishing as she herself might have frankly put it to take stock of
his inheritance in his presence As she passed into the garden through
the low postern door she turned to look along the stretching facade of
the main building with the high stained windows of its banquetinghall
and the state chamber where a king had slept Even in that crisp October
air and with the green of its ivied battlements against the gold of
the distant wood it seemed to lie in the languid repose of an eternal
summer She hurried on down the other terrace into the Italian garden a
quaint survival of past grandeur passed the great orangery and numerous
conservatories making a crystal hamlet in themselvesseeing everywhere
the same luxury But it was a luxury that she fancied was redeemed
from the vulgarity of ostentation by the long custom of years and
generations so unlike the millionaire palaces of her own land and in
her enthusiasm she even fancied it was further sanctified by the grim
monastic founders who had once been content with bread and pulse in the
crumbling and dismantled refectory In the plenitude of her feelings she
felt a slight recognition of some beneficent being who had rolled this
golden apple at her feet and felt as if she really should like to do
good in her sphere

It so chanced that passing through a small gate in the park she saw
walking a little ahead of her a young girl whom she at once recognized
as a Miss Amelyn one of the guests of the evening before Miss
Desborough remembered that she played the accompaniment of one or two
songs upon the piano and had even executed a long solo during the
general conversation without attention from the others and apparently
with little irritation to herself subsiding afterwards into an
armchair quite on the fringe of other peoples conversation She had
been called my dear by one or two dowagers and by her Christian name
by the earl and had a way of impalpably melting out of sight at times
These trifles led Miss Desborough to conclude that she was some kind of
dependent or poor relation Here was an opportunity to begin her work of
doing good She quickened her pace and overtook Miss Amelyn

Let me walk with you she said graciously

The young English girl smiled assent but looked her surprise at seeing
the cynosure of last nights eyes unattended

Oh said Sadie answering the mute query I didnt want to be shown
round by anybody and Im not going to bore YOU with asking to see
sights either Well just walk together wherever YOURE going is good
enough for me

Im going as far as the village said Miss Amelyn looking down
doubtfully at Sadies smart French shoesif you care to walk so far

Sadie noticed that her companion was more solidly booted and that
her straight short skirts although less stylish than her own had
a certain character better fitted to the freer outdoor life of the
country But she only said however The village will do and gayly
took her companions arm

But Im afraid youll find it very uninteresting for I am going to
visit some poor cottages persisted Miss Amelyn with a certain
timid ingenuousness of manner which however was as distinct as Miss
Desboroughs bolder frankness I promised the rectors daughter to take
her place today

And I feel as if I was ready to pour oil and wine to any extent said
Miss Desborough so come along

Miss Amelyn laughed and yet glanced around her timidly as if she
thought that Miss Desborough ought to have a larger and more important
audience Then she continued more confidentially and boldly But it
isnt at all like slumming you know These poor people here are not
very bad and are not at all extraordinary

Never mind said Sadie hurrying her along After a pause she went on
You know the Priory very well I guess

I lived there when I was a little girl with my aunt the Dowager Lady
Beverdale said Miss Amelyn When my cousin Fred who was the young
heir died and the present Lord Beverdale succeededHE never expected
it you know for there were two lives his two elder brothers besides
poor Freds between but they both diedwe went to live in the Dower
House

The Dower House repeated Sadie

Yes Lady Beverdales separate property

But I thought all this propertythe Priorycame into the family
through HER

It didthis was the Amelyns place but the oldest son or nearest male
heir always succeeds to the property and title

Do you mean to say that the present Lord Beverdale turned that old lady
out

Miss Amelyn looked shocked I mean to say she said gravely Lady
Beverdale would have had to go when her own son became of age had
he lived She paused and then said timidly Isnt it that way in
America

Dear no Miss Desborough had a faint recollection that there was
something in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence against
primogeniture No the men havent it ALL their own way THEREnot
much

Miss Amelyn looked as if she did not care to discuss this problem After
a few moments Sadie continued You and Lord Algernon are pretty old
friends I guess

No replied Miss Amelyn He came once or twice to the Priory for the
holidays when he was quite a boy at Marlboroughfor the family werent
very well off and his father was in India He was a very shy boy and
of course no one ever thought of him succeeding

Miss Desborough felt half inclined to be pleased with this and yet half
inclined to resent this possible snubbing of her future husband But
they were nearing the village and Miss Amelyn turned the conversation
to the object of her visit It was a new villagean unhandsome village
for all that it stood near one of the gates of the park It had been
given over to some mines that were still worked in its vicinity and to
the railway which the uncle of the present earl had resisted but the
railway had triumphed and the station for Scrooby Priory was there
There was a grim church of a blackened or weatherbeaten stone on the
hill with a few grim Amelyns reposing crosslegged in the chancel but
the character of the village was as different from the Priory as if it
were in another county They stopped at the rectory where Miss Amelyn
provided herself with certain doles and gifts which the American
girl would have augmented with a fivepound note but for Miss Amelyns
horrified concern As many shillings would do and they would be as
grateful she said More they wouldnt understand

Then keep it and dole it out as you like said Sadie quickly

But I dont think thatthat Lord Beverdale would quite approve
hesitated Miss Amelyn

The pretty brow of her companion knit and her gray eyes flashed
vivaciously What has HE to do with it she said pertly besides you
say these are not HIS poor Take that fivepound noteorIll DOUBLE
it get it changed into sovereigns at the station and hand em round to
every man woman and child

Miss Amelyn hesitated The American girl looked capable of doing what
she said perhaps it was a national way of almsgiving She took the
note with the mental reservation of making a full confession to the
rector and Lord Beverdale

She was right in saying that the poor of Scrooby village were not
interesting There was very little squalor or degradation their poverty
seemed not a descent but a condition to which they had been born the
faces which Sadie saw were dulled and apathetic rather than sullen
or rebellious they stood up when Miss Amelyn entered paying HER the
deference but taking little note of the pretty butterfly who was with
her or rather submitting to her frank curiosity with that dull consent
of the poor as if they had lost even the sense of privacy or a right
to respect It seemed to the American girl that their poverty was more
indicated by what they were SATISFIED with than what she thought they
MISSED It is to be feared that this did not add to Sadies sympathy
all the beggars she had seen in America wanted all they could get and
she felt as if she were confronted with an inferior animal

Theres a wonderful old man lives here said Miss Amelyn as they
halted before a stone and thatch cottage quite on the outskirts of
the village We cant call him one of our poor for he still works
although over eighty and its his pride to keep out of the poorhouse
and as he calls it off the hands of his granddaughters But we
manage to do something for THEM and we hope he profits by it One of
them is at the Priory theyre trying to make a maid of her but her
queer accenttheyre from the northis against her with the servants
I am afraid we wont see old Debs for hes at work again today though
the doctor has warned him

Debs What a funny name

Yes but as many of these people cannot read or write the name is
carried by the ear and not always correctly Some of the railway
navvies who come from the north as he does call him Debbers

They were obliged to descend into the cottage which was so low that it
seemed to have sunk into the earth until its drooping eaves of thatch
mingled with the straw heap beside it Debs was not at home But his
granddaughter was there who after a preliminary bob continued the
stirring of the pot before the fire in tentative silence

I am sorry to find that your grandfather has gone to work again in
spite of the doctors orders said Miss Amelyn

The girl continued to stir the pot and then said without looking
up but as if also continuing a train of aggressive thoughts with her
occupation Eay but es so set oop in issen ee doant take orders
from nobbutleastways doctor Moinds em now moor nor a floy Says ee
knaws there nowt wrong wi is eart Mout be roighthowsiver sarten
sewer is EADS a in a muddle Toims ee goes off stamrin and
starin at nowt as if ee ant a naporth o sense Howsiver I be
doing my duty by emand eres is porritch when a coomsgin a be
sick or maad

What the American understood of the girls speech and manner struck
her as having very little sympathy with either her aged relative or her
present visitor And there was a certain dogged selfish independence
about her that Miss Desborough half liked and half resented However
Miss Amelyn did not seem to notice it and after leaving a bottle of
port for the grandfather she took her leave and led Sadie away As they
passed into the village a carriage returning to the Priory filled with
their fellow guests dashed by but was instantly pulled up at a word
from Lord Algernon who leaped from the vehicle hat in hand and
implored the fair truant and her companion to join them

Were just making a tour around Windover Hill and back to luncheon
he said with a rising color We missed you awfully If we had known
you were so keen on good works and so early at it by Jove wed have
got up a slummin party and all joined

And you havent seen half said Lord Beverdale from the box Miss
Amelyns too partial to the village Theres an old drunken retired
poacher somewhere in a hut in Crawley Woods whom its death to
approach except with a large party Theres malignant diphtheria over
at the South Farm eight down with measles at the keepers and an old
woman who has been bedridden for years

But Miss Desborough was adamant though sparkling She thanked him
but said she had just seen an old woman who had been lying in bed for
twenty years and hadnt spoken the truth once She proposed going
outside of Lord Beverdales own preserves of grainfed poor and
starting up her own game She would return in time for luncheonif she
could if not she should annex the gruel of the first kind incapable
she met

Yet actually she was far from displeased at being accidentally
discovered by these people while following out her capricious whim of
the morning One or two elder ladies who had fought shy of her frocks
and her frankness the evening before were quite touched now by this
butterfly who was willing to forego the sunlight of society and soil
her pretty wings on the haunts of the impoverished with only a single
companionof her own sexand smiled approvingly And in her present
state of mind remembering her companions timid attitude towards Lord
Beverdales opinions she was not above administering this slight snub
to him in her presence

When they had driven away with many regrets Miss Amelyn was deeply
concerned I am afraid she said with timid conscientiousness I
have kept you from going with them And you must be bored with what you
have seen I know I dont believe you really care one bit for itand
you are only doing it to please me

Trot out the rest of your show said Sadie promptly and well wind
up by lunching with the rector

Hed be too delighted said Miss Amelyn with disaster written all
over her girlish truthful face butbutyou knowit really wouldnt
be quite right to Lord Beverdale Youre his principal guestyou know
andtheyd think I had taken you off

Well said Miss Desborough impetuously whats the matter with that
innthe Red Lion We can get a sandwich there I guess Im not VERY
hungry

Miss Amelyn looked horrified for a moment and then laughed but
immediately became concerned again No listen to me REALLY now Let
me finish my round alone Youll have ample time if you go NOW to reach
the Priory for luncheon Do please It would be ever so much better for
everybody I feel quite guilty as it is and I suppose I am already in
Lord Beverdales black books

The trouble in the young girls face was unmistakable and as it suited
Miss Desboroughs purpose just as well to show her independence by
returning as she had set out alone she consented to go Miss Amelyn
showed her a short cut across the park and they separatedto meet at
dinner In this brief fellowship the American girl had kept a certain
supremacy and halffascination over the English girl even while she was
conscious of an invincible character in Miss Amelyn entirely different
from and superior to her own Certainly there was a difference in the
two peoples Why else this inherited conscientious reverence for Lord
Beverdales position shown by Miss Amelyn which she an American alive
to its practical benefits could not understand Would Miss Amelyn and
Lord Algernon have made a better match The thought irritated her even
while she knew that she herself possessed the young mans affections
the power to marry him and as she believed kept her own independence
in the matter

As she entered the iron gates at the lower end of the park and glanced
at the interwoven cipher and crest of the Amelyns still above she was
conscious that the wind was blowing more chill and that a few clouds
had gathered As she walked on down the long winding avenue the sky
became overcast and in one of those strange contrasts of the English
climate the glory of the whole day went out with the sunshine The
woods suddenly became wrinkled and gray the distant hills sombre the
very English turf beneath her feet grew brown a mile and a half away
through the opening of the trees the west part of the Priory looked
a crumbling ivyeaten ruin A few drops of rain fell She hurried
on Suddenly she remembered that the avenue made a long circuit before
approaching the house and that its lower end where she was walking
was but a fringe of the park Consequently there must be a short cut
across some fields and farm buildings to the back of the park and the
Priory She at once diverged to the right presently found a low fence
which she clambered over and again found a footpath which led to a
stile Crossing that she could see the footpath now led directly to the
Priorynow a grim and austere looking pile in the suddenly dejected
landscapeand that it was probably used only by the servants and
farmers A gust of wind brought some swift needles of rain to her cheek
she could see the sad hills beyond the Priory already veiling their
faces she gathered her skirts and ran The next field was a long one
but beside the further stile was a small clump of trees the only ones
between her and the park Hurrying on to that shelter she saw that the
stile was already occupied by a tall but bent figure holding a long
stick in his hand which gave him the appearance against the horizon
of the figure of Time leaning on his scythe As she came nearer she saw
it was indeed an old man half resting on his rake He was very
rugged and weatherbeaten and although near the shelter of the trees
apparently unmindful of the rain that was falling on his bald head and
the limp cap he was holding uselessly in one hand He was staring at
her yet apparently unconscious of her presence A sudden instinct came
upon herit was Debs

She went directly up to him and with that frank common sense which
ordinarily distinguished her took his cap from his hand and put it
on his head grasped his arm firmly and led him to the shelter of the
tree Then she wiped the raindrops from his face with her handkerchief
shook out her own dress and her wet parasol and propping her companion
against the tree said

There Mr Debs Ive heard of people who didnt know enough to come in
when it rained but I never met one before

The old man started lifted his hairy sinewy arm bared to the elbow
and wiped his bare throat with the dry side of it Then a look of
intelligencealbeit half aggressivecame into his face Wheer beest
tha going he asked

Something in his voice struck Sadie like a vague echo Perhaps it was
only the queer dialector some resemblance to his granddaughters
voice She looked at him a little more closely as she said

To the Priory

Whaat

She pointed with her parasol to the gray pile in the distance It was
possible that this demented peasant didnt even UNDERSTAND English

The hall Oh ay Suddenly his brows knit ominously as he faced her
An wassist tha doin drest oop in this foinery Wheer gettist thee
that goawn Thissen or thy maester Nowt even a napron fit for thy
wark as maaid at serviss an parson a gettin tha plaace at Hall So
thoult be high and moity will tha thoult not walk wi maaids but
traipse by thissen like a slut in the toondang tha

Although it was plain to Sadie that the old man in his wandering
perception had mistaken her for his granddaughter in service at the
Priory there was still enough rudeness in his speech for her to have
resented it But strange to say there was a kind of authority in it
that touched her with an uneasiness and repulsion that was stronger than
any other feeling I think you have mistaken me for some one else
she said hurriedly yet wondering why she had admitted it and even
irritated at the admission I am a stranger here a visitor at the
Priory I called with Miss Amelyn at your cottage and saw your other
granddaughter thats how I knew your name

The old mans face changed A sad senile smile of hopeless bewilderment
crept into his hard mouth he plucked his limp cap from his head and
let it hang submissively in his fingers as if it were his sole apology
Then he tried to straighten himself and said Naw offins miss naw
offins If tha knaws mea thall knaw Im grandfeyther to two galls as
moight be tha owern age thall tell ee that old Debs at haaty years
as warked and niver lost a day as man or boy has niver coome oopen em
for naporth An ell keep out o warkus till he doy An ees put by
enow to by wi his own feythers in Lanksheer an not liggen aloane in
parsons choorchyard

It was part of her uneasiness that scarcely understanding or indeed
feeling any interest in these maundering details she still seemed
to have an odd comprehension of his character and some reminiscent
knowledge of him as if she were going through the repetition of some
unpleasant dream Even his wrinkled face was becoming familiar to her
Some weird attraction was holding her she wanted to get away from it as
much as she wanted to analyze it She glanced ostentatiously at the sky
prepared to open her parasol and began to edge cautiously away

Then tha beant from these pearts he said suddenly

No no she said quickly and emphaticallyno Im an American

The old man started and moved towards her eagerly his keen eyes
breaking through the film that at times obscured them Merrikan tha
baist Merrikan Then tha knaws ma son John ee war nowt but a bairn
when brether Dick took un to Merriky Naw Now that wor fifty years
senniver wroate to his old feytherniver coomed back Ee wor
tallloike an thea said e feavored mea He stopped threw up his
head and with his skinny fingers drew back his long straggling locks
from his sunken cheeks and stared in her face The quick transition
of fascination repulsion shock and indefinable apprehension made her
laugh hysterically To her terror he joined in it and eagerly clasped
her wrists Eh lass tha knaws Johntha coomes from un to ole
grandfeyther Whorru Eay but tha thot to fool mea did tha lass
Whoy I knoawed tha voice for a tha foine peacock feathers So tha be
Johns gell coom from Ameriky Dear a dear Coom neaur lass lets see
what thas loike Eh but thoult kiss tha grandfather sewerly

A wild terror and undefined consternation had completely overpowered
her But she made a desperate effort to free her wrists and burst out
madly

Let me go How dare you I dont know you or yours Im nothing to you
or your kin My name is Desboroughdo you understanddo you hear me
Mr DebsDESBOROUGH

At the word the old mans fingers stiffened like steel around her
wrists as he turned upon her a hard invincible face

So thoult call thissen Desborough wilt tha Let me tell tha then
that Debs Debban Debbrook and Desborough are all a seame
Ay thy feyther and thy feythers feyther Thoult be a Desborough
will tha Dang tha and look doon on tha kin and dress thissen in silks
o shame Tell ee thourt an ass gell Dont tha hear An ass for all
tha bean Johns bairn An ass thats what tha beast

With flashing eyes and burning cheeks she made one more supreme
effort lifting her arms freeing her wrists and throwing the old man
staggering from her Then she leaped the stile turned and fled through
the rain But before she reached the end of the field she stopped She
had freed herselfshe was stronger than hewhat had she to fear He
was crazy Yes he MUST be crazy and he had insulted her but he was an
old manand God knows what Her heart was beating rapidly her breath
was hurried but she ran back to the stile

He was not there The field sloped away on either side of it But she
could distinguish nothing in the pouring rain above the windswept
meadow He must have gone home Relieved for a moment she turned and
hurried on towards the Priory

But at every step she was followed not by the old mans presence but
by what he had said to her which she could not shake off as she had
shaken off his detaining fingers Was it the ravings of insanity or had
she stumbled unwittingly upon some secretwas it after all a SECRET
Perhaps it was something they all knew or would know later And she had
come down here for this For back of her indignation back even of her
disbelief in his insanity there was an awful sense of truth The names
he had flung out of Debs Debban and Debbrook now flashed upon
her as something she had seen before but had not understood Until she
satisfied herself of this she felt she could not live or breathe She
loathed the Priory with its austere exclusiveness as it rose before
her she wished she had never entered it but it contained that which
she must know and know at once She entered the nearest door and ran
up the grand staircase Her flushed face and disordered appearance were
easily accounted for by her exposure to the sudden storm She went to
her bedroom sent her maid to another room to prepare a change of dress
and sinking down before her travelingdesk groped for a document Ah
there it wasthe expensive toy that she had played with She hastily
ran over its leaves to the page she already remembered And there among
the dashes and perpendicular lines she had jested over last night on
which she had thought was a collateral branch of the line stood her
fathers name and that of Richard his uncle with the bracketed note in
red ink see Debbrook Daybrook Debbers and Debs Yes this gaunt
halfcrazy overworked peasant content to rake the dead leaves before
the rolling chariots of the Beverdales was her grandfather that poorly
clad girl in the cottage and even the menial in the scullery of this
very house that might be HERS were her COUSINS She burst into a laugh
and then refolded the document and put it away

At luncheon she was radiant and sparkling Her drenched clothes were
an excuse for a new and ravishing toilette She had never looked so
beautiful before and significant glances were exchanged between some
of the guests who believed that the expected proposal had already come
But those who were of the carriage party knew otherwise and of Lord
Algernons disappointment Lord Beverdale contented himself with
rallying his fair guest on the becomingness of good works But he
continued Youre offering a dreadful example to these ladies Miss
Desborough and I know I shall never hereafter be able to content them
with any frivolous morning amusement at the Priory For myself when
I am grown gouty and hideous I know I shall bloom again as a district
visitor

Yet under this surface sparkle and nervous exaltation Sadie never lost
consciousness of the gravity of the situation If her sense of humor
enabled her to see one side of its grim irony if she experienced a
wicked satisfaction in accepting the admiration and easy confidence of
the highborn guests knowing that her cousin had assisted in preparing
the meal they were eating she had never lost sight of the practical
effect of the discovery she had made And she had come to a final
resolution She should leave the Priory at once and abandon all idea of
a matrimonial alliance with its heir Inconsistent as this might seem
to her selfish worldly nature it was nevertheless in keeping with a
certain pride and independence that was in her blood She did not love
Lord Algernon neither did she love her grandfather she was equally
willing to sacrifice either or both she knew that neither Lord Algernon
nor his father would make her connections an objection however they
might wish to keep the fact a secret or otherwise dispose of them by
pensions or emigration but she could not bear to KNOW IT HERSELF
She never could be happy as the mistress of Scrooby Priory with that
knowledge she did not idealize it as a principle Carefully weighing it
by her own practical common sense she said to herself that it wouldnt
pay The highest independence is often akin to the lowest selfishness
she did not dream that the same pride which kept her grandfather from
the workhouse and support by his daughters and had even kept him from
communicating with his own son now kept her from acknowledging them
even for the gift of a title and domain There was only one question
before her should she stay long enough to receive the proposal of Lord
Algernon and then decline it Why should she not snatch that single
feminine joy out of the ashes of her burntup illusion She knew that an
opportunity would be offered that afternoon The party were to take tea
at Broxby Hall and Lord Algernon was to drive her there in his dogcart
Miss Desborough had gone up to her bedroom to put on a warmer cloak and
had rung twice or thrice impatiently for her maid

When the girl made her appearance apologetic voluble and excited
Miss Desborough scarcely listened to her excuses until a single word
suddenly arrested her attention It was old Debs

What ARE you talking about said Sadie pausing in the adjustment of
her hat on her brown hair

Old Debs missthats what they call him an old parkkeeper just
found dead in a pool of water in the fields the grandfather of one of
the servants here and theres such an excitement in the servants hall
The gentlemen all knew it too for I heard Lord Algernon say that
he was looking very queer lately and might have had a fit and Lord
Beverdale has sent word to the coroner And only think the people here
are such fools that they darent touch or move the poor man and him
lyin there in the rain all the time until the coroner comes

Miss Desborough had been steadily regarding herself in the glass to see
if she had turned pale She had She set her teeth together until
the color partly returned But she kept her face away from the maid
Thatll do she said quietly You can tell me all later I have some
important news myself and I may not go out after all I want you to
take a note for me She went to her table wrote a line in pencil
folded it scribbled an address upon it handed it to the girl and
gently pushed her from the room



The consul was lingering on the terrace beside one of the carriages at
a little distance a groom was holding the nervous thoroughbred of Lord
Algernons dogcart Suddenly he felt a touch on his shoulder and Miss
Desboroughs maid put a note in his hand It contained only a line


Please come and see me in the library but without making any fuss about
itat once S D


The consul glanced around him no one had apparently noticed the
incident He slipped back into the house and made his way to the
library It was a long gallery at the further end Miss Desborough stood
cloaked veiled and coquettishly hatted She was looking very beautiful
and animated I want you to please do me a great favor she said with
an adorable smile as your own countrywoman you knowfor the sake of
Fourth of July and Pumpkin Pie and the Old Flag I dont want to go
to this circus today I am going to leave here tonight I am Honest
Injin I want YOU to manage it I want you to say that as consul youve
received important news for me the death of some relative if you like
or better something AFFECTING MY PROPERTY you know with a little
satirical laugh I guess that would fetch em So go at once

But really Miss Desborough do let us talk this over before you
decide implored the bewildered consul Think what a disappointment to
your host and these ladies Lord Algernon expects to drive you there he
is already waiting The party was got up for you Miss Desborough made
a slight grimace I mean you ought to sacrifice somethingbut I trust
there is really nothing seriousto them

If YOU do not speak to them I will said Miss Desborough firmly If
you say what I tell you it will come the more plausibly from you Come
My mind is made up One of us must break the news Shall it be you or
I She drew her cloak over her shoulders and made a step forwards

The consul saw she was determined Then wait here till I return but
keep yourself out of sight he said and hurried away Between the
library and the terrace he conceived a plan His perplexity lent him a
seriousness which befitted the gravity of the news he had to disclose
I am sorry to have to tell you he said taking Lord Beverdale aside
that I was the unlucky bearer of some sad news to Miss Desborough this
morning through my consular letterssome matter concerning the death
of a relation of hers and some wearisome question of property I
thought that it was of little importance and that she would not take
it seriously but I find I was mistaken It may even oblige her to catch
the London train tonight I promised to make her excuses to you for the
present and Im afraid I must add my own to them as she wishes me to
stay and advise her in this matter which requires some prompt action

Miss Desborough was right the magic word property changed the slight
annoyance on the earls face to a sympathetic concern Dear me I trust
it is nothing really serious he said Of course you will advise her
and by the way if my solicitor Withers wholl be here tomorrow
can do anything you know call him in I hope shell be able to see
me later It could not be a NEAR relation who died I fancy she has no
brothers or sisters I understand

A cousin I think an old friend said the consul hastily He heard
Lord Beverdale say a few words to his companions saw with a tinge of
remorse a cloud settle upon Lord Algernons fresh face as he appealed
in a whisper to old Lady Mesthyn who leaned forward from the carriage
and said If the dear child thought I could be of any service I should
only be too glad to stay with her

I knew she would appreciate Lady Mesthyns sympathy said the
ingenious consul quickly but I really think the question is more a
business oneand

Ah yes said the old lady shaking her head its dreadful of
course but we must all think of THAT

As the carriage drove away the consul hurried back a little viciously
to his fair countrywoman There he said I have done it If I have
managed to convey either the idea that you are a penniless orphan or
that I have official information that you are suspected of a dynamite
conspiracy dont blame me And now he said as I have excused myself
on the ground that I must devote myself to this dreadful business of
yours perhaps youll tell me WHAT it really is

Not a word more said Miss Desborough except she addedchecking
her smile with a weary gestureexcept that I want to leave this
dreadful place at once There dont ask me any more

There could be no doubt of the girls sincerity Nor was it the
extravagant caprice of a petted idol What had happened He might have
believed in a lovers quarrel but he knew that she and Lord Algernon
could have had no private interview that evening He must perforce
accept her silence yet he could not help saying

You seemed to like the place so much last night I say you havent
seen the Priory ghost have you

The Priory ghost she said quickly Whats that

The old monk who passes through the cloisters with the sacred oil the
bell and the smell of incense whenever any one is to die here By Jove
it would have been a good story to tell instead of this cockandbull
one about your property And there WAS a death here today Youd have
added the sibyls gifts to your other charms

Tell me about that old man she said looking past him out of the
window I was at his cottage this morning But no first let us go
out You can take me for a walk if you like You see I am all ready
and Im just stifling here

They descended to the terrace together Where would you like to go he
asked

To the village I may want to telegraph you know

They turned into the avenue but Miss Desborough stopped

Is there not a shorter cut across the fields she asked over there

There is said the consul

They both turned into the footpath which led to the farm and stile
After a pause she said Did you ever talk with that poor old man

No

Then you dont know if he really was crazy as they think

No But they may have thought an old mans forgetfulness of present
things and his habit of communing with the past was insanity For all
that he was a plucky independent old fellow with a grim purpose that
was certainly rational

I suppose in his independence he would not have taken favors from these
people or anybody

I should think not

Dont you think it was just horridtheir leaving him alone in the
rain when he might have been only in a fit

The doctor says he died suddenly of heart disease said the consul
It might have happened at any moment and without warning

Ah that was the coroners verdict then said Miss Desborough
quickly

The coroner did not think it necessary to have any inquest after Lord
Beverdales statement It wouldnt have been very joyous for the Priory
party And I dare say he thought it might not be very cheerful for YOU

How very kind said the young girl with a quick laugh But do you
know that its about the only thing human original and striking that
has happened in this place since Ive been here And so unexpected
considering how comfortably everything is ordered here beforehand

Yet you seemed to like that kind of thing very well last evening
said the consul mischievously

That was last night retorted Miss Desborough and you know the line
Colors seen by candlelight do not look the same by day But Im going
to be very consistent today for I intend to go over to that poor mans
cottage again and see if I can be of any service Will you go with me

Certainly said the consul mystified by his companions extraordinary
conduct yet apparent coolness of purpose and hoping for some further
explanation Was she only an inexperienced flirt who had found herself
on the point of a serious entanglement she had not contemplated Yet
even then he knew she was clever enough to extricate herself in some
other way than this abrupt and brutal tearing through the meshes Or was
it possible that she really had any intelligence affecting her property
He reflected that he knew very little of the Desboroughs but on the
other hand he knew that Beverdale knew them much better and was a
prudent man He had no right to demand her confidence as a reward for
his secrecy he must wait her pleasure Perhaps she would still explain
women seldom could resist the triumph of telling the secret that puzzled
others

When they reached the village she halted before the low roof of Debss
cottage I had better go in first she said you can come in later
and in the meantime you might go to the station for me and find out the
exact time that the express train leaves for the north

But said the astonished consul I thought you were going to London

No said Miss Desborough quietly I am going to join some friends at
Harrogate

But that train goes much earlier than the train south andand Im
afraid Lord Beverdale will not have returned so soon

How sad said Miss Desborough with a faint smile but we must bear
up under it andIll write him I will be here until you return

She turned away and entered the cottage The granddaughter she had
already seen and her sister the servant at the Priory were both
chatting comfortably but ceased as she entered and both rose with
awkward respect There was little to suggest that the body of their
grandfather already in a rough oak shell was lying upon trestles
beside them

You have carried out my orders I see said Miss Desborough laying
down her parasol

Ay miss but it was main haard gettin et dooan so soon and et
cooast

Never mind the cost Ive given you money enough I think and if I
havent I guess I can give you more

Ay miss Abbut the pason ead gi un a funeral for nowt

But I understood you to say said Miss Desborough with an impatient
flash of eye that your grandfather wished to be buried with his
kindred in the north

Ay miss said the girl apologetically an naw ees savit th munny
Abbut ed bean tickled ad ee knowed it Dear dear ee niver thowt et
ud be gien by stranger an not es ownt fammaly

For all that you neednt tell anybody it was given by ME said Miss
Desborough And youll be sure to be ready to take the train this
afternoonwithout delay There was a certain peremptoriness in her
voice very unlike Miss Amelyns yet apparently much more effective with
the granddaughter

Ay miss Then if thall excoose mea Ill go streight to oory oop
sexten

She bustled away Now said Miss Desborough turning to the other
girl I shall take the same train and will probably see you on the
platform at York to give my final directions Thats all Go and see if
the gentleman who came with me has returned from the station

The girl obeyed Left entirely alone Miss Desborough glanced around
the room and then went quietly up to the unlidded coffin The repose of
death had softened the hard lines of the old mans mouth and brow into a
resemblance she now more than ever understood She had stood thus only
a few years before looking at the same face in a gorgeously inlaid
mahogany casket smothered amidst costly flowers and surrounded by
friends attired in all the luxurious trappings of woe yet it was the
same face that was now rigidly upturned to the bare thatch and rafters
of that crumbling cottage herself its only companion She lifted her
delicate veil with both hands and stooping down kissed the hard cold
forehead without a tremor Then she dropped her veil again over her dry
eyes readjusted it in the little cheap blackframed mirror that hung
against the wall and opened the door as the granddaughter returned The
gentleman was just coming from the station

Remember to look out for me at York said Miss Desborough extending
her gloved hand Goodby till then The young girl respectfully
touched the ends of Miss Desboroughs fingers dropped a curtsy and
Miss Desborough rejoined the consul

You have barely time to return to the Priory and see to your luggage
said the consul if you must go But let me hope that you have changed
your mind

I have not changed my mind said Miss Desborough quietly and my
baggage is already packed After a pause she said thoughtfully Ive
been wondering

What said the consul eagerly

Ive been wondering if people brought up to speak in a certain dialect
where certain words have their own significance and color and are part
of their own lives and experienceif even when they understand another
dialect they really feel any sympathy with it or the person who speaks
it

Apropos ofasked the consul

These people Ive just left I dont think I quite felt with them and
I guess they didnt feel with me

But said the consul laughingly you know that we Americans speak
with a decided dialect of our own and attach the same occult meaning to
it Yet upon my word I think that Lord Beverdaleor shall I say Lord
Algernonwould not only understand that American word guess as you
mean it but would perfectly sympathize with you

Miss Desboroughs eyes sparkled even through her veil as she glanced at
her companion and said I GUESS NOT

As the tea party had not yet returned it fell to the consul to
accompany Miss Desborough and her maid to the station But here he was
startled to find a collection of villagers upon the platform gathered
round two young women in mourning and an ominouslooking box
He mingled for a moment with the crowd and then returned to Miss
Desboroughs side

Really he said with a concern that was scarcely assumed I ought
not to let you go The omens are most disastrous You came here to a
death you are going away with a funeral

Then its high time I took myself off said the lady lightly

Unless like the ghostly monk you came here on a mission and have
fulfilled it

Perhaps I have Goodby



In spite of the bright and characteristic letter which Miss Desborough
left for her hosta letter which mingled her peculiar shrewd sense
with her humorous extravagance of expressionthe consul spent a
somewhat uneasy evening under the fire of questions that assailed him
in reference to the fair deserter But he kept loyal faith with her
adhering even to the letter of her instructions and only once was
goaded into more active mendacity The conversation had turned upon
Debs and the consul had remarked on the singularity of the name A
guest from the north observed however that the name was undoubtedly a
contraction Possibly it might have been Debborough or even the same
name as our fair friend

But didnt Miss Desborough tell you last night that she had been
hunting up her people with a family tree or something like that said
Lord Algernon eagerly I just caught a word here and there for you
were both laughing

The consul smiled blandly You may well say so for it was all the most
delightful piece of pure invention and utter extravagance It would have
amused her still more if she had thought you were listening and took it
seriously

Of course I see said the young fellow with a laugh and a slight
rise of color I knew she was taking some kind of a rise out of YOU
and that remark reminded me of it

Nevertheless within a year Lord Algernon was happily married to the
daughter of a South African millionaire whose bridal offerings alone
touched the sum of half a million It was also said that the mother
was impossible and the father unspeakable the relations
inextinguishable but the wedding was an occasion and in the
succeeding year of festivity it is presumed that the names of Debs and
Desborough were alike forgotten

But they existed still in a little hamlet near the edge of a bleak
northern moor where they were singularly exalted on a soaring shaft of
pure marble above the submerged and mossgrown tombstones of a simple
country churchyard So great was the contrast between the modern and
pretentious monument and the graves of the humbler forefathers of the
village that even the Americans who chanced to visit it were shocked at
what they believed was the ostentatious and vulgar pride of one of their
own countrywomen For on its pedestal was inscribed

 Sacred to the Memory
 of
 JOHN DEBS DESBOROUGH
 Formerly of this parish
 Who departed this life October 20th 1892
 At Scrooby Priory
 At the age of eightytwo years
 This monument was erected as a loving testimony
 by his granddaughter
 Sadie Desborough of New York U S A

 And evening brings us home




SALOMY JANES KISS


Only one shot had been fired It had gone wide of its markthe
ringleader of the Vigilantesand had left Red Pete who had fired
it covered by their rifles and at their mercy For his hand had been
cramped by hard riding and his eye distracted by their sudden onset
and so the inevitable end had come He submitted sullenly to his
captors his companion fugitive and horsethief gave up the protracted
struggle with a feeling not unlike relief Even the hot and revengeful
victors were content They had taken their men alive At any time during
the long chase they could have brought them down by a rifle shot but it
would have been unsportsmanlike and have ended in a free fight instead
of an example And for the matter of that their doom was already
sealed Their end by a rope and a tree although not sanctified by law
would have at least the deliberation of justice It was the tribute paid
by the Vigilantes to that order which they had themselves disregarded in
the pursuit and capture Yet this strange logic of the frontier sufficed
them and gave a certain dignity to the climax

Ef youve got anything to say to your folks say it NOW and say it
quick said the ringleader

Red Pete glanced around him He had been run to earth at his own cabin
in the clearing whence a few relations and friends mostly women and
children noncombatants had outflowed gazing vacantly at the twenty
Vigilantes who surrounded them All were accustomed to scenes of
violence bloodfeud chase and hardship it was only the suddenness of
the onset and its quick result that had surprised them They looked on
with dazed curiosity and some disappointment there had been no fight
to speak ofno spectacle A boy nephew of Red Pete got upon the
rainbarrel to view the proceedings more comfortably a tall handsome
lazy Kentucky girl a visiting neighbor leaned against the doorpost
chewing gum Only a yellow hound was actively perplexed He could
not make out if a hunt were just over or beginning and ran eagerly
backwards and forwards leaping alternately upon the captives and the
captors

The ringleader repeated his challenge Red Pete gave a reckless laugh
and looked at his wife

At which Mrs Red Pete came forward It seemed that she had much to say
incoherently furiously vindictively to the ringleader His soul would
roast in hell for that days work He called himself a man skunkin
in the open and afraid to show himself except with a crowd of other
Kiyis around a house of women and children Heaping insult upon
insult inveighing against his low blood his ancestors his dubious
origin she at last flung out a wild taunt of his invalid wife the
insult of a woman to a woman until his white face grew rigid and only
that WesternAmerican fetich of the sanctity of sex kept his twitching
fingers from the lock of his rifle Even her husband noticed it and
with a halfauthoritative Let up on that old gal and a pat of his
freed left hand on her back took his last parting The ringleader
still white under the lash of the womans tongue turned abruptly to the
second captive And if YOUVE got anybody to say goodby to nows
your chance

The man looked up Nobody stirred or spoke He was a stranger there
being a chance confederate picked up by Red Pete and known to no one
Still young but an outlaw from his abandoned boyhood of which father
and mother were only a forgotten dream he loved horses and stole them
fully accepting the frontier penalty of life for the interference with
that animal on which a mans life so often depended But he understood
the good points of a horse as was shown by the ones he bestrodeuntil
a few days before the property of Judge Boompointer This was his sole
distinction

The unexpected question stirred him for a moment out of the attitude
of reckless indifference for attitude it was and a part of his
profession But it may have touched him that at that moment he was less
than his companion and his virago wife However he only shook his head
As he did so his eye casually fell on the handsome girl by the doorpost
who was looking at him The ringleader too may have been touched by
his complete loneliness for HE hesitated At the same moment he saw
that the girl was looking at his friendless captive

A grotesque idea struck him

Salomy Jane ye might do worse than come yere and say goodby to a
dying man and him a stranger he said

There seemed to be a subtle stroke of poetry and irony in this that
equally struck the apathetic crowd It was well known that Salomy Jane
Clay thought no small potatoes of herself and always held off the local
swain with a lazy nymphlike scorn Nevertheless she slowly disengaged
herself from the doorpost and to everybodys astonishment lounged
with languid grace and outstretched hand towards the prisoner The color
came into the gray reckless mask which the doomed man wore as her right
hand grasped his left just loosed by his captors Then she paused her
shy fawnlike eyes grew bold and fixed themselves upon him She took
the chewinggum from her mouth wiped her red lips with the back of
her hand by a sudden lithe spring placed her foot on his stirrup and
bounding to the saddle threw her arms about his neck and pressed a kiss
upon his lips

They remained thus for a hushed momentthe man on the threshold of
death the young woman in the fullness of youth and beautylinked
together Then the crowd laughed in the audacious effrontery of the
girls act the ultimate fate of the two men was forgotten She slipped
languidly to the ground SHE was the focus of all eyesshe only The
ringleader saw it and his opportunity He shouted Times upForward
urged his horse beside his captives and the next moment the whole
cavalcade was sweeping over the clearing into the darkening woods

Their destination was Sawyers Crossing the headquarters of the
committee where the council was still sitting and where both culprits
were to expiate the offense of which that council had already found
them guilty They rode in great and breathless hastea haste in which
strangely enough even the captives seemed to join That haste possibly
prevented them from noticing the singular change which had taken place
in the second captive since the episode of the kiss His high color
remained as if it had burned through his mask of indifference his eyes
were quick alert and keen his mouth half open as if the girls kiss
still lingered there And that haste had made them careless for the
horse of the man who led him slipped in a gopherhole rolled over
unseated his rider and even dragged the bound and helpless second
captive from Judge Boompointers favorite mare In an instant they were
all on their feet again but in that supreme moment the second captive
felt the cords which bound his arms had slipped to his wrists By
keeping his elbows to his sides and obliging the others to help him
mount it escaped their notice By riding close to his captors and
keeping in the crush of the throng he further concealed the accident
slowly working his hands downwards out of his bonds

Their way lay through a sylvan wilderness midleg deep in ferns whose
tall fronds brushed their horses sides in their furious gallop and
concealed the flapping of the captives loosened cords The peaceful
vista more suggestive of the offerings of nymph and shepherd than of
human sacrifice was in a strange contrast to this whirlwind rush of
stern armed men The westering sun pierced the subdued light and the
tremor of leaves with yellow lances birds started into song on blue and
dovelike wings and on either side of the trail of this vengeful
storm could be heard the murmur of hidden and tranquil waters In a
few moments they would be on the open ridge whence sloped the common
turnpike to Sawyers a mile away It was the custom of returning
cavalcades to take this hill at headlong speed with shouts and cries
that heralded their coming They withheld the latter that day as
inconsistent with their dignity but emerging from the wood swept
silently like an avalanche down the slope They were well under way
looking only to their horses when the second captive slipped his right
arm from the bonds and succeeded in grasping the reins that lay trailing
on the horses neck A sudden vaquero jerk which the welltrained
animal understood threw him on his haunches with his forelegs firmly
planted on the slope The rest of the cavalcade swept on the man who
was leading the captives horse by the riata thinking only of another
accident dropped the line to save himself from being dragged backwards
from his horse The captive wheeled and the next moment was galloping
furiously up the slope

It was the work of a moment a trained horse and an experienced hand
The cavalcade had covered nearly fifty yards before they could pull up
the freed captive had covered half that distance uphill The road was
so narrow that only two shots could be fired and these broke dust two
yards ahead of the fugitive They had not dared to fire low the horse
was the more valuable animal The fugitive knew this in his extremity
also and would have gladly taken a shot in his own leg to spare that of
his horse Five men were detached to recapture or kill him The latter
seemed inevitable But he had calculated his chances before they could
reload he had reached the woods again winding in and out between
the pillared tree trunks he offered no mark They knew his horse was
superior to their own at the end of two hours they returned for he
had disappeared without track or trail The end was briefly told in the
Sierra Record

Red Pete the notorious horsethief who had so long eluded justice
was captured and hung by the Sawyers Crossing Vigilantes last week
his confederate unfortunately escaped on a valuable horse belonging
to Judge Boompointer The judge had refused one thousand dollars for
the horse only a week before As the thief who is still at large would
find it difficult to dispose of so valuable an animal without detection
the chances are against either of them turning up again



Salomy Jane watched the cavalcade until it had disappeared Then she
became aware that her brief popularity had passed Mrs Red Pete in
stormy hysterics had included her in a sweeping denunciation of the
whole universe possibly for simulating an emotion in which she herself
was deficient The other women hated her for her momentary exaltation
above them only the children still admired her as one who had
undoubtedly canoodled with a man agoing to be hunga daring flight
beyond their wildest ambition Salomy Jane accepted the change with
charming unconcern She put on her yellow nankeen sunbonneta hideous
affair that would have ruined any other woman but which only enhanced
the piquancy of her fresh brunette skintied the strings letting the
blueblack braids escape below its frilled curtain behind jumped on
her mustang with a casual display of agile ankles in shapely white
stockings whistled to the hound and waving her hand with a So long
sonny to the lately bereft but admiring nephew flapped and fluttered
away in her short brown holland gown

Her fathers house was four miles distant Contrasted with the cabin she
had just quitted it was a superior dwelling with a long leanto at
the rear which brought the eaves almost to the ground and made it look
like a low triangle It had a long barn and cattle sheds for Madison
Clay was a great stockraiser and the owner of a quarter section It
had a sittingroom and a parlor organ whose transportation thither had
been a marvel of packing These things were supposed to give Salomy
Jane an undue importance but the girls reserve and inaccessibility to
local advances were rather the result of a cool lazy temperament and
the preoccupation of a large protecting admiration for her father for
some years a widower For Mr Madison Clays life had been threatened in
one or two feudsit was said not without causeand it is possible
that the pathetic spectacle of her father doing his visiting with a
shotgun may have touched her closely and somewhat prejudiced her against
the neighboring masculinity The thought that cattle horses and
quarter section would one day be hers did not disturb her calm As for
Mr Clay he accepted her as housewifely though somewhat interfering
and being one of his own womankind therefore not without some degree
of merit

Wots this yer Im hearin of your doins over at Red Petes
Honeyfoglin with a horsethief eh said Mr Clay two days later at
breakfast

I reckon you heard about the straight thing then said Salomy Jane
unconcernedly without looking round

What do you kalkilate Rube will say to it What are you goin to tell
HIM said Mr Clay sarcastically

Rube or Reuben Waters was a swain supposed to be favored
particularly by Mr Clay Salomy Jane looked up

Ill tell him that when HES on his way to be hung Ill kiss himnot
till then said the young lady brightly

This delightful witticism suited the paternal humor and Mr Clay
smiled but nevertheless he frowned a moment afterwards

But this yer hossthief got away arter all and thats a hoss of a
different color he said grimly

Salomy Jane put down her knife and fork This was certainly a new and
different phase of the situation She had never thought of it before
and strangely enough for the first time she became interested in the
man Got away she repeated Did they let him off

Not much said her father briefly Slipped his cords and going down
the grade pulled up short just like a vaquero agin a lassoed bull
almost draggin the man leadin him off his hoss and then skyuted up
the grade For that matter on that hoss o Judge Boompointers he mout
have dragged the whole posse of em down on their knees ef he liked
Sarved em right too Instead of stringin him up afore the door or
shootin him on sight they must allow to take him down afore the hull
committee for an example Example be blowed Ther s example enough
when some stranger comes unbeknownst slap onter a man hanged to a tree
and plugged full of holes THATS an example and HE knows what it
means Wot more do ye want But then those Vigilantes is allus clingin
and hangin onter some mere scrap o the law theyre pretendin to
despise It makes me sick Why when Jake Myers shot your ole Aunt
Vineys second husband and I laid in wait for Jake afterwards in the
Butternut Hollow did I tie him to his hoss and fetch him down to your
Aunt Vineys cabin for an example before I plugged him No in deep
disgust No Why I just meandered through the wood carelesslike
till he comes out and I just rode up to him and I said

But Salomy Jane had heard her fathers story before Even ones dearest
relatives are apt to become tiresome in narration I know dad she
interrupted but this yer manthis hossthiefdid HE get clean away
without gettin hurt at all

He did and unless hes fool enough to sell the hoss he kin keep away
too So ye see ye cant ladle out purp stuff about a dyin stranger
to Rube He wont swaller it

All the same dad returned the girl cheerfully I reckon to say it
and say MORE Ill tell him that ef HE manages to get away too Ill
marry himthere But ye dont ketch Rube takin any such risks in
gettin ketched or in gettin away arter

Madison Clay smiled grimly pushed back his chair rose dropped a
perfunctory kiss on his daughters hair and taking his shotgun from
the corner departed on a peaceful Samaritan mission to a cow who had
dropped a calf in the far pasture Inclined as he was to Reubens wooing
from his eligibility as to property he was conscious that he was sadly
deficient in certain qualities inherent in the Clay family It certainly
would be a kind of mesalliance

Left to herself Salomy Jane stared a long while at the coffeepot and
then called the two squaws who assisted her in her household duties to
clear away the things while she went up to her own room to make her bed
Here she was confronted with a possible prospect of that proverbial bed
she might be making in her willfulness and on which she must lie
in the photograph of a somewhat serious young man of refined
featuresReuben Watersstuck in her windowframe Salomy Jane smiled
over her last witticism regarding him and enjoyed it like your true
humorist and then catching sight of her own handsome face in the
little mirror smiled again But wasnt it funny about that horsethief
getting off after all Good Lordy Fancy Reuben hearing he was alive and
going round with that kiss of hers set on his lips She laughed again a
little more abstractedly And he had returned it like a man holding her
tight and almost breathless and he going to be hung the next minute
Salomy Jane had been kissed at other times by force chance or
stratagem In a certain ingenuous forfeit game of the locality known as
Im apinin many had pined for a sweet kiss from Salomy Jane
which she had yielded in a sense of honor and fair play She had never
been kissed like this beforeshe would never again and yet the man was
alive And behold she could see in the mirror that she was blushing

She should hardly know him again A young man with very bright eyes
a flushed and sunburnt cheek a kind of fixed look in the face and no
beard no none that she could feel Yet he was not at all like Reuben
not a bit She took Reubens picture from the window and laid it on her
workbox And to think she did not even know this young mans name That
was queer To be kissed by a man whom she might never know Of course
he knew hers She wondered if he remembered it and her But of course he
was so glad to get off with his life that he never thought of anything
else Yet she did not give more than four or five minutes to these
speculations and like a sensible girl thought of something else Once
again however in opening the closet she found the brown holland
gown she had worn on the day before thought it very unbecoming and
regretted that she had not worn her best gown on her visit to Red Petes
cottage On such an occasion she really might have been more impressive

When her father came home that night she asked him the news No they
had NOT captured the second horsethief who was still at large Judge
Boompointer talked of invoking the aid of the despised law It remained
then to see whether the horsethief was fool enough to try to get rid
of the animal Red Petes body had been delivered to his widow Perhaps
it would only be neighborly for Salomy Jane to ride over to the funeral
But Salomy Jane did not take to the suggestion kindly nor yet did she
explain to her father that as the other man was still living she
did not care to undergo a second disciplining at the widows hands
Nevertheless she contrasted her situation with that of the widow with
a new and singular satisfaction It might have been Red Pete who had
escaped But he had not the grit of the nameless one She had already
settled his heroic quality

Ye aint harkenin to me Salomy

Salomy Jane started

Here Im askin ye if yeve see that hound Phil Larrabee sneaking by
yer today

Salomy Jane had not But she became interested and selfreproachful
for she knew that Phil Larrabee was one of her fathers enemies He
wouldnt dare to go by here unless he knew you were out she said
quickly

Thats what gets me he said scratching his grizzled head Ive been
kind o thinkin o him all day and one of them Chinamen said he saw
him at Sawyers Crossing He was a kind of friend o Petes wife Thats
why I thought yer might find out ef hed been there Salomy Jane
grew more selfreproachful at her fathers selfinterest in her
neighborliness But that aint all continued Mr Clay Thar was
tracks over the far pasture that warnt mine I followed them and they
went round and round the house two or three times ez ef they mout hev
bin prowlin and then I lost em in the woods again Its just like
that sneakin hound Larrabee to hev bin lyin in wait for me and afraid
to meet a man fair and square in the open

You just lie low dad for a day or two more and let me do a little
prowlin said the girl with sympathetic indignation in her dark eyes
Ef its that skunk Ill spot him soon enough and let you know whar
hes hiding

Youll just stay where ye are Salomy said her father decisively
This aint no womans workthough I aint sayin you havent got more
head for it than some men I know

Nevertheless that night after her father had gone to bed Salomy Jane
sat by the open window of the sittingroom in an apparent attitude of
languid contemplation but alert and intent of eye and ear It was a
fine moonlit night Two pines near the door solitary pickets of the
serried ranks of distant forest cast long shadows like paths to the
cottage and sighed their spiced breath in the windows For there was no
frivolity of vine or flower round Salomy Janes bower The clearing was
too recent the life too practical for vanities like these But the moon
added a vague elusiveness to everything softened the rigid outlines
of the sheds gave shadows to the lidless windows and touched with
merciful indirectness the hideous debris of refuse gravel and the gaunt
scars of burnt vegetation before the door Even Salomy Jane was affected
by it and exhaled something between a sigh and a yawn with the breath
of the pines Then she suddenly sat upright

Her quick ear had caught a faint click click in the direction of the
wood her quicker instinct and rustic training enabled her to determine
that it was the ring of a horses shoe on flinty ground her knowledge
of the locality told her it came from the spot where the trail passed
over an outcrop of flint scarcely a quarter of a mile from where she
sat and within the clearing It was no errant stock for the foot was
shod with iron it was a mounted trespasser by night and boded no good
to a man like Clay

She rose threw her shawl over her head more for disguise than shelter
and passed out of the door A sudden impulse made her seize her fathers
shotgun from the corner where it stoodnot that she feared any danger
to herself but that it was an excuse She made directly for the wood
keeping in the shadow of the pines as long as she could At the fringe
she halted whoever was there must pass her before reaching the house

Then there seemed to be a suspense of all nature Everything was deadly
stilleven the moonbeams appeared no longer tremulous soon there was a
rustle as of some stealthy animal among the ferns and then a dismounted
man stepped into the moonlight It was the horsethiefthe man she had
kissed

For a wild moment a strange fancy seized her usually sane intellect and
stirred her temperate blood The news they had told her was NOT true
he had been hung and this was his ghost He looked as white and
spiritlike in the moonlight dressed in the same clothes as when she
saw him last He had evidently seen her approaching and moved quickly
to meet her But in his haste he stumbled slightly she reflected
suddenly that ghosts did not stumble and a feeling of relief came
over her And it was no assassin of her father that had been prowling
aroundonly this unhappy fugitive A momentary color came into her
cheek her coolness and hardihood returned it was with a tinge of
sauciness in her voice that she said

I reckoned you were a ghost

I mout have been he said looking at her fixedly but I reckon Id
have come back here all the same

Its a little riskier comin back alive she said with a levity
that died on her lips for a singular nervousness half fear and half
expectation was beginning to take the place of her relief of a moment
ago Then it was YOU who was prowlin round and makin tracks in the
far pasture

Yes I came straight here when I got away

She felt his eyes were burning her but did not dare to raise her own
Why she began hesitated and ended vaguely HOW did you get here

You helped me

I

Yes That kiss you gave me put life into megave me strength to get
away I swore to myself Id come back and thank you alive or dead

Every word he said she could have anticipated so plain the situation
seemed to her now And every word he said she knew was the truth Yet
her cool common sense struggled against it

Whats the use of your escaping ef youre comin back here to be
ketched again she said pertly

He drew a little nearer to her but seemed to her the more awkward as
she resumed her selfpossession His voice too was broken as if by
exhaustion as he said catching his breath at intervals

Ill tell you You did more for me than you think You made another man
o me I never had a man woman or child do to me what you did I never
had a friendonly a pal like Red Pete who picked me up on shares
I want to quit this yerwhat Im doin I want to begin by doin the
square thing to youHe stopped breathed hard and then said brokenly
My hoss is over thar staked out I want to give him to you Judge
Boompointer will give you a thousand dollars for him I aint lyin
its Gods truth I saw it on the handbill agin a tree Take him and
Ill get away afoot Take him Its the only thing I can do for you and
I know it dont half pay for what you did Take it your father can get
a reward for you if you cant

Such were the ethics of this strange locality that neither the man who
made the offer nor the girl to whom it was made was struck by anything
that seemed illogical or indelicate or at all inconsistent with
justice or the horsethiefs real conversion Salomy Jane nevertheless
dissented from another and weaker reason

I dont want your hoss though I reckon dad might but youre just
starvin Ill get suthin She turned towards the house

Say youll take the hoss first he said grasping her hand At the
touch she felt herself coloring and struggled expecting perhaps another
kiss But he dropped her hand She turned again with a saucy gesture
said Hol on Ill come right back and slipped away the mere shadow
of a coy and flying nymph in the moonlight until she reached the house

Here she not only procured food and whiskey but added a long dustcoat
and hat of her fathers to her burden They would serve as a disguise
for him and hide that heroic figure which she thought everybody must
now know as she did Then she rejoined him breathlessly But he put the
food and whiskey aside

Listen he said Ive turned the hoss into your corral Youll find
him there in the morning and no one will know but that he got lost and
joined the other hosses

Then she burst out But youYOUwhat will become of you Youll be
ketched

Ill manage to get away he said in a low voice efef

Ef what she said tremblingly Ef youll put the heart in me
againas you did he gasped

She tried to laughto move away She could do neither Suddenly he
caught her in his arms with a long kiss which she returned again and
again Then they stood embraced as they had embraced two days before
but no longer the same For the cool lazy Salomy Jane had been
transformed into another womana passionate clinging savage Perhaps
something of her fathers blood had surged within her at that supreme
moment The man stood erect and determined

Wots your name she whispered quickly It was a womans quickest way
of defining her feelings

Dart

Yer first name

Jack

Let me go now Jack Lie low in the woods till tomorrow sunup Ill
come again

He released her Yet she lingered a moment Put on those things she
said with a sudden happy flash of eyes and teeth and lie close till I
come And then she sped away home

But midway up the distance she felt her feet going slower and something
at her heartstrings seemed to be pulling her back She stopped turned
and glanced to where he had been standing Had she seen him then she
might have returned But he had disappeared She gave her first sigh
and then ran quickly again It must be nearly ten oclock It was not
very long to morning

She was within a few steps of her own door when the sleeping woods and
silent air appeared to suddenly awake with a sharp crack

She stopped paralyzed Another crack followed that echoed over to
the far corral She recalled herself instantly and dashed off wildly to
the woods again

As she ran she thought of one thing only He had been dogged by one
of his old pursuers and attacked But there were two shots and he was
unarmed Suddenly she remembered that she had left her fathers gun
standing against the tree where they were talking Thank God she may
again have saved him She ran to the tree the gun was gone She ran
hither and thither dreading at every step to fall upon his lifeless
body A new thought struck her she ran to the corral The horse was not
there He must have been able to regain it and escaped AFTER the shots
had been fired She drew a long breath of relief but it was caught up
in an apprehension of alarm Her father awakened from his sleep by the
shots was hurriedly approaching her

Whats up now Salomy Jane he demanded excitedly

Nothin said the girl with an effort Nothin at least that I can
find She was usually truthful because fearless and a lie stuck in her
throat but she was no longer fearless thinking of HIM I wasnt abed
so I ran out as soon as I heard the shots fired she answered in return
to his curious gaze

And youve hid my gun somewhere where it cant be found he said
reproachfully Ef it was that sneak Larrabee and he fired them shots
to lure me out he might have potted me without a show a dozen times
in the last five minutes

She had not thought since of her fathers enemy It might indeed
have been he who had attacked Jack But she made a quick point of the
suggestion Run in dad run in and find the gun youve got no show
out here without it She seized him by the shoulders from behind
shielding him from the woods and hurried him half expostulating half
struggling to the house

But there no gun was to be found It was strange it must have been
mislaid in some corner Was he sure he had not left it in the barn But
no matter now The danger was over the Larrabee trick had failed
he must go to bed now and in the morning they would make a search
together At the same time she had inwardly resolved to rise before him
and make another search of the wood and perhapsfearful joy as she
recalled her promisefind Jack alive and well awaiting her

Salomy Jane slept little that night nor did her father But towards
morning he fell into a tired mans slumber until the sun was well up the
horizon Far different was it with his daughter she lay with her face
to the window her head half lifted to catch every sound from the
creaking of the sunwarped shingles above her head to the faroff
moan of the rising wind in the pine trees Sometimes she fell into a
breathless halfecstatic trance living over every moment of the stolen
interview feeling the fugitives arm still around her his kisses on
her lips hearing his whispered voice in her earsthe birth of her new
life This was followed again by a period of agonizing dreadthat he
might even then be lying his life ebbing away in the woods with her
name on his lips and she resting here inactive until she half started
from her bed to go to his succor And this went on until a pale opal
glow came into the sky followed by a still paler pink on the summit of
the white Sierras when she rose and hurriedly began to dress Still so
sanguine was her hope of meeting him that she lingered yet a moment to
select the brown holland skirt and yellow sunbonnet she had worn when
she first saw him And she had only seen him twice Only TWICE It would
be cruel too cruel not to see him again

She crept softly down the stairs listening to the longdrawn breathing
of her father in his bedroom and then by the light of a guttering
candle scrawled a note to him begging him not to trust himself out of
the house until she returned from her search and leaving the note open
on the table swiftly ran out into the growing day

Three hours afterwards Mr Madison Clay awoke to the sound of loud
knocking At first this forced itself upon his consciousness as his
daughters regular morning summons and was responded to by a grunt of
recognition and a nestling closer in the blankets Then he awoke with a
start and a muttered oath remembering the events of last night and his
intention to get up early and rolled out of bed Becoming aware by this
time that the knocking was at the outer door and hearing the shout of
a familiar voice he hastily pulled on his boots his jean trousers
and fastening a single suspender over his shoulder as he clattered
downstairs stood in the lower room The door was open and waiting
upon the threshold was his kinsman an old ally in many a
bloodfeudBreckenridge Clay

You ARE a cool one Mad said the latter in halfadmiring indignation

Whats up said the bewildered Madison

YOU ought to be and scootin out o this said Breckenridge grimly
Its all very well to know nothin but here Phil Larrabees friends
hev just picked him up drilled through with slugs and deader nor a
crow and now theyre lettin loose Larrabees two halfbrothers on you
And you must go like a derned fool and leave these yer things behind you
in the bresh he went on querulously lifting Madison Clays dustcoat
hat and shotgun from his horse which stood saddled at the door
Luckily I picked them up in the woods comin here Ye aint got more
than time to get over the state line and among your folks thar afore
theyll be down on you Hustle old man What are you gawkin and
starin at

Madison Clay had stared amazed and bewilderedhorrorstricken
The incidents of the past night for the first time flashed upon him
clearlyhopelessly The shot his finding Salomy Jane alone in
the woods her confusion and anxiety to rid herself of him the
disappearance of the shotgun and now this new discovery of the taking
of his hat and coat for a disguise SHE had killed Phil Larrabee in that
disguise after provoking his first harmless shot She his own child
Salomy Jane had disgraced herself by a mans crime had disgraced him
by usurping his right and taking a mean advantage by deceit of a foe

Gimme that gun he said hoarsely

Breckenridge handed him the gun in wonder and slowly gathering
suspicion Madison examined nipple and muzzle one barrel had been
discharged It was true The gun dropped from his hand

Look here old man said Breckenridge with a darkening face theres
bin no foul play here Thars bin no hiring of men no deputy to do this
job YOU did it fair and squareyourself

Yes by God burst out Madison Clay in a hoarse voice Who says I
didnt

Reassured yet believing that Madison Clay had nerved himself for
the act by an overdraught of whiskey which had affected his memory
Breckenridge said curtly Then wake up and lite out ef ye want me to
stand by you

Go to the corral and pick me out a hoss said Madison slowly yet not
without a certain dignity of manner Ive suthin to say to Salomy
Jane afore I go He was holding her scribbled note which he had just
discovered in his shaking hand

Struck by his kinsmans manner and knowing the dependent relations
of father and daughter Breckenridge nodded and hurried away Left to
himself Madison Clay ran his fingers through his hair and straightened
out the paper on which Salomy Jane had scrawled her note turned it
over and wrote on the back


You might have told me you did it and not leave your ole father to
find it out how you disgraced yourself and him too by a lowdown
underhanded womans trick Ive said I done it and took the blame
myself and all the sneakiness of it that folks suspect If I get away
aliveand I dont care much whichyou neednt foller The house and
stock are yours but you aint any longer the daughter of your disgraced
father

MADISON CLAY


He had scarcely finished the note when with a clatter of hoofs and a
led horse Breckenridge reappeared at the door elate and triumphant
Youre in nigger luck Mad I found that stole hoss of Judge
Boompointers had got away and strayed among your stock in the corral
Take him and youre safe he cant be outrun this side of the state
line

I aint no hossthief said Madison grimly

Nobody sez ye are but youd be wussa foolef you didnt take him
Im testimony that you found him among your hosses Ill tell Judge
Boompointer youve got him and ye kin send him back when youre safe
The judge will be mighty glad to get him back and call it quits So ef
youve writ to Salomy Jane come

Madison Clay no longer hesitated Salomy Jane might return at any
momentit would be part of her fool womanishnessand he was in
no mood to see her before a third party He laid the note on the table
gave a hurried glance around the house which he grimly believed he was
leaving forever and striding to the door leaped on the stolen horse
and swept away with his kinsman

But that note lay for a week undisturbed on the table in full view of
the open door The house was invaded by leaves pine cones birds
and squirrels during the hot silent empty days and at night by shy
stealthy creatures but never again day or night by any of the Clay
family It was known in the district that Clay had flown across the
state line his daughter was believed to have joined him the next day
and the house was supposed to be locked up It lay off the main road
and few passed that way The starving cattle in the corral at last broke
bounds and spread over the woods And one night a stronger blast than
usual swept through the house carried the note from the table to the
floor where whirled into a crack in the flooring it slowly rotted

But though the sting of her fathers reproach was spared her Salomy
Jane had no need of the letter to know what had happened For as she
entered the woods in the dim light of that morning she saw the figure of
Dart gliding from the shadow of a pine towards her The unaffected cry
of joy that rose from her lips died there as she caught sight of his
face in the open light

You are hurt she said clutching his arm passionately

No he said But I wouldnt mind that if

Youre thinkin I was afeard to come back last night when I heard the
shootin but I DID come she went on feverishly I ran back here when
I heard the two shots but you were gone I went to the corral but your
hoss wasnt there and I thought youd got away

I DID get away said Dart gloomily I killed the man thinkin he
was huntin ME and forgettin I was disguised He thought I was your
father

Yes said the girl joyfully he was after dad and YOUyou killed
him She again caught his hand admiringly

But he did not respond Possibly there were points of honor which this
horsethief felt vaguely with her father Listen he said grimly
Others think it was your father killed him When I did itfor he fired
at me firstI ran to the corral again and took my hoss thinkin I
might be follered I made a clear circuit of the house and when I found
he was the only one and no one was follerin I come back here and took
off my disguise Then I heard his friends find him in the wood and I
know they suspected your father And then another man come through the
woods while I was hidin and found the clothes and took them away He
stopped and stared at her gloomily

But all this was unintelligible to the girl Dad would have got
the better of him ef you hadnt she said eagerly so whats the
difference

All the same he said gloomily I must take his place

She did not understand but turned her head to her master Then youll
go back with me and tell him ALL she said obediently

Yes he said

She put her hand in his and they crept out of the wood together She
foresaw a thousand difficulties but chiefest of all that he did not
love as she did SHE would not have taken these risks against their
happiness

But alas for ethics and heroism As they were issuing from the wood
they heard the sound of galloping hoofs and had barely time to
hide themselves before Madison Clay on the stolen horse of Judge
Boompointer swept past them with his kinsman

Salomy Jane turned to her lover



And here I might as a moral romancer pause leaving the guilty
passionate girl eloped with her disreputable lover destined to lifelong
shame and misery misunderstood to the last by a criminal fastidious
parent But I am confronted by certain facts on which this romance is
based A month later a handbill was posted on one of the sentinel pines
announcing that the property would be sold by auction to the highest
bidder by Mrs John Dart daughter of Madison Clay Esq and it was
sold accordingly Still laterby ten yearsthe chronicler of these
pages visited a certain stock or breeding farm in the Blue Grass
Country famous for the popular racers it has produced He was told
that the owner was the best judge of horseflesh in the country
Small wonder added his informant for they say as a young man out in
California he was a horsethief and only saved himself by eloping with
some rich farmers daughter But hes a straightout and respectable man
now whose word about horses cant be bought and as for his wife shes
a beauty To see her at the Springs rigged out in the latest fashion
youd never think she had ever lived out of New York or wasnt the wife
of one of its millionaires




THE MAN AND THE MOUNTAIN


He was such a large strong man that when he first set foot in the
little parallelogram I called my garden it seemed to shrink to half its
size and become preposterous But I noticed at the same time that he was
holding in the open palm of his huge hand the roots of a violet with
such infinite tenderness and delicacy that I would have engaged him as
my gardener on the spot But this could not be as he was already the
proud proprietor of a marketgarden and nursery on the outskirts of the
suburban Californian town where I lived He would however come for two
days in the week stock and look after my garden and impart to my
urban intellect such horticultural hints as were necessary His name was
Rutli which I presumed to be German but which my neighbors rendered
as Rootleigh possibly from some vague connection with his occupation
His own knowledge of English was oral and phonetic I have a delightful
recollection of a bill of his in which I was charged for fioletz with
the vague addition of maine cains Subsequent explanation proved it to
be many kinds

Nevertheless my little garden bourgeoned and blossomed under his
large protecting hand I became accustomed to walk around his feet
respectfully when they blocked the tiny paths and to expect the total
eclipse of that gardenbed on which he worked by his huge bulk For the
tiniest and most reluctant rootlet seemed to respond to his caressing
paternal touch it was a pretty sight to see his huge fingers tying up
some slender stalk to its stick with the smallest thread and he had
a reverent way of laying a bulb or seed in the ground and then gently
shaping and smoothing a small mound over it which made the little
inscription on the stick above more like an affecting epitaph than
ever Much of this gentleness may have been that apology for his great
strength common with large men but his face was distinctly amiable
and his very light blue eyes were at times wistful and doglike in their
kindliness I was soon to learn however that placability was not
entirely his nature

The garden was part of a fifty vara lot of land on which I was
simultaneously erecting a house But the garden was finished before the
house was through certain circumstances very characteristic of that
epoch and civilization I had purchased the Spanish title the only
LEGAL one to the land which however had been in POSSESSION of a
squatter But he had been unable to hold that possession against a
jumperanother kind of squatter who had entered upon it covertly
fenced it in and marked it out in building sites Neither having legal
rights they could not invoke the law the last man held possession
There was no doubt that in due course of litigation and time both these
ingenuous gentlemen would have been dispossessed in favor of the real
ownermyselfbut that course would be a protracted one Following
the usual custom of the locality I paid a certain sum to the jumper to
yield up peaceably HIS possession of the land and began to build upon
it It might be reasonably supposed that the question was settled
But it was not The house was nearly finished when one morning I was
called out of my editorial sanctum by a pallid painter looking even
more whiteleaded than usual who informed me that my house was in the
possession of five armed men The entry had been made peaceably
during the painters absence to dinner under a wayside tree When they
returned they had found their pots and brushes in the road and an
intimation from the windows that their reentrance would be forcibly
resisted as a trespass

I honestly believe that Rutli was more concerned than myself over
this dispossession While he loyally believed that I would get back
my property he was dreadfully grieved over the inevitable damage
that would be done to the garden during this interval of neglect and
carelessness I even think he would have made a truce with my enemies
if they would only have let him look after his beloved plants As it
was he kept a passing but melancholy surveillance of them and was
indeed a better spy of the actions of the intruders than any I could
have employed One day to my astonishment he brought me a mossrose
bud from a bush which had been trained against a column of the veranda
It appeared that he had called from over the fence the attention of
one of the men to the neglected condition of the plant and had obtained
permission to come in and tie it up The men being merely hirelings
of the chief squatter had no personal feeling and I was not therefore
surprised to hear that they presently allowed Rutli to come in
occasionally and look after his precious slips If they had any
suspicions of his great strength it was probably offset by his peaceful
avocation and his bland childlike face Meantime I had begun the usual
useless legal proceeding but had also engaged a few rascals of my own
to be ready to take advantage of any want of vigilance on the part of my
adversaries I never thought of Rutli in that connection any more than
they had

A few Sundays later I was sitting in the little teaarbor of Rutlis
nursery peacefully smoking with him Presently he took his long
chinabowled pipe from his mouth and looking at me blandly over his
yellow mustache said

You vonts sometimes to go in dot house eh

I said Decidedly

Mit a revolver and keep dot house dose men out

Yes

Vell I put you in dot housetoday

Sunday

Shoost so It is a goot day On der Suntay DREE men vill out go to
valk mit demselluffs and visky trinken TWO holding up two gigantic
fingers apparently only a shade or two smaller than his destined
victims stay dere Dose I lift de fence over

I hastened to inform him that any violence attempted against the parties
WHILE IN POSSESSION although that possession was illegal would by a
fatuity of the law land him in the county jail I said I would not hear
of it

But suppose dere vos no fiolence Suppose dose men vos villin eh How
vos dot for high

I dont understand

So You shall NOT understand Dot is better Go away now and dell your
men to coom dot house arount at halluff past dree But YOU coom mit
yourselluff alone shoost as if you vos spazieren gehen for a valk by
dat fence at dree Ven you shall dot front door vide open see go in
and dere you vos You vill der rest leef to me

It was in vain that I begged Rutli to divulge his plan and pointed out
again the danger of his technically breaking the law But he was firm
assuring me that I myself would be a witness that no assault would be
made I looked into his clear goodhumored eyes and assented I had a
burning desire to right my wrongs but I think I also had considerable
curiosity

I passed a miserable quarter of an hour after I had warned my partisans
and then walked alone slowly down the broad leafy street towards the
scene of contest I have a very vivid recollection of my conflicting
emotions I did not believe that I would be killed I had no distinct
intention of killing any of my adversaries but I had some considerable
concern for my loyal friend Rutli whom I foresaw might be in some peril
from the revolver in my unpracticed hand If I could only avoid shooting
HIM I would be satisfied I remember that the bells were ringing for
churcha church of which my enemy the chief squatter was a deacon
in good standingand I felt guiltily conscious of my revolver in my
hippocket as two or three churchgoers passed me with their hymnbooks
in their hands I walked leisurely so as not to attract attention
and to appear at the exact time a not very easy task in my youthful
excitement At last I reached the front gate with a beating heart There
was no one on the high veranda which occupied three sides of the low
onestoried house nor in the garden before it But the front door was
open I softly passed through the gate darted up the veranda and into
the house A single glance around the hall and bare deserted rooms
still smelling of paint showed me it was empty and with my pistol in
one hand and the other on the lock of the door I stood inside ready to
bolt it against any one but Rutli But where was HE

The sound of laughter and a noise like skylarking came from the rear of
the house and the back yard Then I suddenly heard Rutlis heavy tread
on the veranda but it was slow deliberate and so exaggerated in
its weight that the whole house seemed to shake with it Then from the
window I beheld an extraordinary sight It was Rutli swaying from
side to side but steadily carrying with outstretched arms two of the
squatter party his hands tightly grasping their collars Yet I
believe his touch was as gentle as with the violets His face was
preternaturally grave theirs to my intense astonishment while they
hung passive from his arms wore that fatuous imbecile smile seen on
the faces of those who lend themselves to tricks of acrobats and strong
men in the arena He slowly traversed the whole length of one side of
the house walked down the steps to the gate and then gravely deposited
them OUTSIDE I heard him say Dot vins der pet aint it and
immediately after the sharp click of the gatelatch

Without understanding a thing that had happened I rightly conceived
this was the cue for my appearance with my revolver at the front door
As I opened it I still heard the sound of laughter which however
instantly stopped at a sentence from Rutli which I could not hear
There was an oath the momentary apparition of two furious and indignant
faces over the fence but these however seemed to be instantly
extinguished and put down by the enormous palms of Rutli clapped upon
their heads There was a pause and then Rutli turned around and quietly
joined me in the doorway But the gate was not again opened until the
arrival of my partisans when the house was clearly in my possession

Safe inside with the door bolted I turned eagerly to Rutli for an
explanation It then appeared that during his occasional visits to the
garden he had often been an object of amusement and criticism to the men
on account of his size which seemed to them ridiculously inconsistent
with his great good humor gentleness and delicacy of touch They had
doubted his strength and challenged his powers He had responded once
or twice before lifting weights or even carrying one of his critics
at arms length for a few steps But he had reserved his final feat
for this day and this purpose It was for a bet which they had eagerly
accepted secure in their belief in his simplicity the sincerity of his
motives in coming there and glad of the opportunity of a little Sunday
diversion In their security they had not locked the door when they
came out and had not noticed that HE had opened it This was his simple
story His only comment I haf von der pet but I dinks I shall nod
gollect der money The two men did not return that afternoon nor did
their comrades Whether they wisely conceived that a man who was so
powerful in play might be terrible in earnest whether they knew that
his act in which they had been willing performers had been witnessed
by passing citizens who supposed it was skylarking or whether their
employer got tired of his expensive occupation I never knew The public
believed the latter Rutli myself and the two men he had evicted alone
kept our secret

From that time Rutli and I became firm friends and long after I had
no further need of his services in the recaptured house I often found
myself in the little teaarbor of his prosperous nursery He was frugal
sober and industrious small wonder that in that growing town he waxed
rich and presently opened a restaurant in the main street connected
with his marketgarden which became famous His relations to me
never changed with his changed fortunes he was always the simple
marketgardener and florist who had aided my first housekeeping and
stood by me in an hour of need Of all things regarding himself he was
singularly reticent I do not think he had any confidants or intimates
even among his own countrymen whom I believed to be German But one day
he quite accidentally admitted he was a Swiss As a youthful admirer
of the race I was delighted and told him so with the enthusiastic
addition that I could now quite understand his independence with his
devoted adherence to anothers cause He smiled sadly and astonished me
by saying that he had not heard from Switzerland since he left six years
ago He did not want to hear anything he even avoided his countrymen
lest he should I was confounded

But I said surely you have a longing to return to your country all
Swiss have You will go back some day just to breathe the air of your
native mountains

I shall go back some days said Rutli after I have made mooch mooch
money but not for dot air

What for then

For revengeto get efen

Surprised and for a moment dismayed as I was I could not help
laughing Rutli and revenge Impossible And to make it the more
absurd he was still smoking gently and regarding me with soft
complacent eyes So unchanged was his face and manner that he might have
told me he was going back to be married

You do not oonderstand he said forgivingly Some days I shall dell
to you id Id is a story You shall make it yourselluff for dose babers
dot you write It is not bretty berhaps aint it but it is droo And
de endt is not yet

Only that Rutli never joked except in a ponderous fashion with many
involved sentences I should have thought he was taking a goodhumored
rise out of me But it was not funny I am afraid I dismissed it from my
mind as a revelation of something weak and puerile quite inconsistent
with his practical common sense and strong simplicity and wished he had
not alluded to it I never asked him to tell me the story It was a year
later and only when he had invited me to come to the opening of a new
hotel erected by him at a mountain spa of great resort that he himself
alluded to it

The hotel was a wonderful affair even for those days and Rutlis
outlay of capital convinced me that by this time he must have made the
mooch money he coveted Something of this was in my mind when we sat
by the window of his handsomely furnished private office overlooking
the pines of a Californian canyon I asked him if the scenery was like
Switzerland

Ach no he replied but I vill puild a hotel shoost like dis dare

Is that a part of your revenge I asked with a laugh

Ah so a bart

I felt relieved a revenge so practical did not seem very malicious or
idiotic After a pause he puffed contemplatively at his pipe and then
said I dell you somedings of dot story now

He began I should like to tell it in his own particular English mixed
with American slang but it would not convey the simplicity of the
narrator He was the son of a large family who had lived for centuries
in one of the highest villages in the Bernese Oberland He attained his
size and strength early but with a singular distaste to use them in
the rough regular work on the farm although he was a great climber and
mountaineer and what was at first overlooked as mere boyish fancy had
an insatiable love and curious knowledge of plants and flowers He knew
the haunts of Edelweiss Alpine rose and blue gentian and had brought
home rare and unknown blossoms from under the icy lips of glaciers
But as he did this when his time was supposed to be occupied in looking
after the cows in the higher pastures and making cheeses there was
trouble in that hardworking practical family A giant with the tastes
and disposition of a schoolgirl was an anomaly in a Swiss village
Unfortunately again he was not studious his record in the village
school had been on a par with his manual work and the family had not
even the consolation of believing that they were fostering a genius In
a community where practical industry was the highest virtue it was not
strange perhaps that he was called lazy and shiftless no one knew
the long climbs and tireless vigils he had undergone in remote solitudes
in quest of his favorites or knowing forgave him for it Abstemious
frugal and patient as he was even the crusts of his fathers table
were given him grudgingly He often went hungry rather than ask the
bread he had failed to earn How his great frame was nurtured in those
days he never knew perhaps the giant mountains recognized some kin
in him and fed and strengthened him after their own fashion Even his
gentleness was confounded with cowardice Dot vos de hardtest he said
simply it is not goot to be opligit to half crush your brudder ven he
would make a laugh of you to your sweetheart The end came sooner than
he expected and oddly enough through this sweetheart Gottlieb she
said to him one day the English Fremde who stayed here last night met
me when I was carrying some of those beautiful flowers you gave me He
asked me where they were to be found and I told him only YOU knew He
wants to see you go to him It may be luck to you Rutli went The
stranger an English Alpine climber of scientific tastes talked with
him for an hour At the end of that time to everybodys astonishment
he engaged this hopeless idler as his personal guide for three months
at the sum of five francs a day It was inconceivable it was unheard
of The Englander was as mad as Gottlieb whose intellect had always
been under suspicion The schoolmaster pursed up his lips the pastor
shook his head no good could come of it the family looked upon it as
another freak of Gottliebs but there was one big mouth less to feed
and more room in the kitchen and they let him go They parted from him
as ungraciously as they had endured his presence

Then followed two months of sunshine in Rutlis lifeassociation with
his beloved plants and the intelligent sympathy and direction of a
cultivated man Even in altitudes so dangerous that they had to take
other and more experienced guides Rutli was always at his masters
side That savants collection of Alpine flora excelled all previous
ones he talked freely with Rutli of further work in the future and
relaxed his English reserve so far as to confide to him that the outcome
of their collection and observation might be a book He gave a flower
a Latin name in which even the ignorant and delighted Rutli could
distinguish some likeness to his own But the book was never compiled
In one of their later and more difficult ascents they and their two
additional guides were overtaken by a sudden storm Swept from their
feet down an icebound slope Rutli alone of the ropedtogether party
kept a foothold on the treacherous incline Here this young Titan with
bleeding fingers clenched in a rock cleft sustained the struggles and
held up the lives of his companions by that precious thread for more
than an hour Perhaps he might have saved them but in their desperate
efforts to regain their footing the rope slipped upon a jagged edge of
outcrop and parted as if cut by a knife The two guides passed without
an outcry into obscurity and death Rutli with a last despairing
exertion dragged to his own level his unconscious master crippled by a
broken leg

Your true hero is apt to tell his tale simply Rutli did not dwell upon
these details nor need I Left alone upon a treacherous ice slope
in benumbing cold with a helpless man eight hours afterwards he
staggered half blind incoherent and inarticulate into a shelter
hut with the dead body of his master in his stiffened arms The
shelterkeepers turned their attention to Rutli who needed it most
Blind and delirious with scarce a chance for life he was sent the next
day to a hospital where he lay for three months helpless imbecile
and unknown The dead body of the Englishman was identified and sent
home the bodies of the guides were recovered by their friends but no
one knew aught of Rutli even his name While the event was still fresh
in the minds of those who saw him enter the hut with the body of his
master a paragraph appeared in a Berne journal recording the heroism of
this nameless man But it could not be corroborated nor explained by the
demented hero and was presently forgotten Six months from the day he
had left his home he was discharged cured He had not a kreutzer in his
pocket he had never drawn his wages from his employer he had preferred
to have it in a lump sum that he might astonish his family on his
return His eyes were still weak his memory feeble only his great
physical strength remained through his long illness A few sympathizing
travelers furnished him the means to reach his native village many
miles away He found his family had heard of the loss of the Englishman
and the guides and had believed he was one of them Already he was
forgotten

Ven you vos once peliefed to be det said Rutli after a philosophic
pause and puff it vos not goot to ondeceif beoples You oopset

among your frients and your family vos covered up alretty You are
loocky if you vill not fint some vellars shtanding upon id My frent

But your sweetheart I said eagerly

A slight gleam of satire stole into Rutlis light eyes My sweetheart
ven I vos dinks det is der miller engaged do bromply It is mooch

Then thats your revenge That is what you really intend to do I
said half laughing yet with an uneasy recollection of his illness and
enfeebled mind

Yes Look here I show you somedings He opened a drawer of his desk
and took out what appeared to be some diagrams plans and a small
watercolored map like a surveyors tracing Look he said laying
his finger on the latter dat is a map from my fillage I hef myselluff
made it out from my memory Dot pointing to a blank space is der
mountain side high up so far It is no goot until I vill a tunnel make
or der grade lefel Dere vas mine faders house dere vos der church
der schoolhouse dot vos de burgomasters house he went on pointing
to the respective plots in this old curving parallelogram of the
mountain shelf So was the fillage when I leave him on the 5th of
March eighteen hundred and feefty Now you shall see him shoost as I
vill make him ven I go back He took up another plan beautifully
drawn and colored and evidently done by a professional hand It was
a practical yet almost fairylike transformation of the same spot
The narrow mountain shelf was widened by excavation and a boulevard
stretched on either side A great hotel not unlike the one in which we
sat stood in an open terrace with gardens and fountainsthe site of
his fathers house Blocks of pretty dwellings shops and cafes filled
the intermediate space I laid down the paper

How long have you had this idea

Efer since I left dere fifteen years ago

But your father and mother may be dead by this time

So but dere vill be odders Und der blaceit vill remain

But all this will cost a fortune and you are not sure

I know shoost vot id vill gost to a cend

And you think you can ever afford to carry out your idea

I VILL affort id Ven you shall make yet some moneys and go to Europe
you shall see I VILL infite you dere first Now coom and look der house
around



I did NOT make some moneys but I DID go to Europe Three years after
this last interview with Rutli I was coming from Interlaken to Berne
by rail I had not heard from him and I had forgotten the name of his
village but as I looked up from the paper I was reading I suddenly
recognized him in the further end of the same compartment I occupied
His recognition of me was evidently as sudden and unexpected After our
first handgrasp and greeting I said

And how about our new village

Dere is no fillage

What You have given up the idea

Yes There is no fillage olt or new

I dont understand

He looked at me a moment You have not heard

No

He gently picked up a little local guidebook that lay in my lap and
turning its leaves pointed to a page and read as follows

5 M beyond the train passes a curve R where a fine view of the lake
may be seen A little to the R rises the steep slopes of the  the
scene of a terrible disaster At three oclock on March 5 1850 the
little village of  lying midway of the slope with its population
of 950 souls was completely destroyed by a landslip from the top of
the mountain So sudden was the catastrophe that not a single escape
is recorded A large portion of the mountain crest as will be observed
when it is seen in profile descended to the valley burying the
unfortunate village to a depth variously estimated at from 1000 ft
to 1800 ft The geological causes which produced this extraordinary
displacement have been fully discussed but the greater evidence points
to the theory of subterranean glaciers 5 M beyond  the train
crosses the R bridge

I laid down the guidebook in breathless astonishment

And you never heard of this in all these years

Nefer I asked no questions I read no pooks I have no ledders from
home

And yet youI stopped I could not call him a fool neither could
I in the face of his perfect composure and undisturbed eyes exhibit
a concern greater than his own An uneasy recollection of what he
confessed had been his mental condition immediately after his accident
came over me Had he been the victim of a strange hallucination
regarding his house and family all these years Were these dreams of
revenge this fancy of creating a new village only an outcome of
some shock arising out of the disaster itself which he had long since
forgotten

He was looking from the window Coom he said ve are near der blace
I vill show id to you He rose and passed out to the rear platform
We were in the rear car and a new panorama of the lake and mountains
flashed upon us at every curve of the line I followed him Presently
he pointed to what appeared to be a sheer wall of rock and stunted
vegetation towering two or three thousand feet above us which started
out of a gorge we were passing Dere it vos he said I saw the vast
stretch of rock face rising upward and onward but nothing else No
debris no ruins nor even a swelling or rounding of the mountain flank
over that awful tomb Yet stay as we dashed across the gorge and the
face of the mountain shifted high up the skyline was slightly broken
as if a few inches a mere handful of the crest was crumbled away And
thenboth gorge and mountain vanished

I was still embarrassed and uneasy and knew not what to say to this man
at my side whose hopes and ambition had been as quickly overthrown and
buried and whose lifedream had as quickly vanished But he himself
taking his pipe from his lips broke the silence

It vos a narrow esgabe

What was

Vy dis dings If I had stayed in my faders house I vould haf been
det for goot and perried too Somedimes dose dings cooms oudt apout

Unvanquished philosopher As we stood there looking at the flying
landscape and sinking lesser hills one by one the great snow peaks
slowly arose behind them lifting themselves as if to take a last
wondering look at the man they had triumphed over but had not subdued




THE PASSING OF ENRIQUEZ


When Enriquez Saltillo ran away with Miss Mannersley as already
recorded in these chronicles her relatives and friends found it much
easier to forgive that illassorted union than to understand it For
after all Enriquez was the scion of an old SpanishCalifornian family
and in due time would have his share of his fathers three square
leagues whatever incongruity there was between his lively Latin
extravagance and Miss Mannersleys Puritan precision and intellectual
superiority They had gone to Mexico Mrs Saltillo as was known
having an interest in Aztec antiquities and he being utterly submissive
to her wishes For myself from my knowledge of Enriquezs nature I had
grave doubts of his entire subjugation although I knew the prevailing
opinion was that Mrs Saltillos superiority would speedily tame him
Since his brief and characteristic note apprising me of his marriage
I had not heard from him It was therefore with some surprise a good
deal of reminiscent affection and a slight twinge of reproach that two
years after I looked up from some proofs in the sanctum of the Daily
Excelsior to recognize his handwriting on a note that was handed to me
by a yellow Mexican boy

  See The Devotion of Enriquez in Selected Stories by
 Bret Harte Gutenberg 1312

A single glance at its contents showed me that Mrs Saltillos
correct Bostonian speech had not yet subdued Enriquezs peculiar
SpanishAmerican slang

Here we are againright side up with careat 1110 Dupont Street
Telegraph Hill Second floor from top Ring and push No book agents
need apply Hows your royal nibs I kiss your hand Come at sixthe
band shall play at sevenand regard your friend Mees Boston who
will tell you about the little old nigger boys and your old Uncle
Ennery

Two things struck me Enriquez had not changed Mrs Saltillo had
certainly yielded up some of her peculiar prejudices For the address
given far from being a fashionable district was known as the Spanish
quarter which while it still held some old Spanish families was
chiefly given over to halfcastes and obscurer foreigners Even poverty
could not have driven Mrs Saltillo to such a refuge against her will
nevertheless a good deal of concern for Enriquezs fortune mingled with
my curiosity as I impatiently waited for six oclock to satisfy it

It was a breezy climb to 1110 Dupont Street and although the street
had been graded the houses retained their airy elevation and were
accessible only by successive flights of wooden steps to the front door
which still gave perilously upon the street sixty feet below I now
painfully appreciated Enriquezs adaptation of the timehonored joke
about the second floor An invincible smell of garlic almost took my
remaining breath away as the door was opened to me by a swarthy Mexican
woman whose loose camisa seemed to be slipping from her unstable bust
and was held on only by the mantualike shawl which supplemented it
gripped by one brown hand Dizzy from my ascent to that narrow perch
which looked upon nothing but the distant bay and shores of Contra
Costa I felt as apologetic as if I had landed from a balloon but the
woman greeted me with a languid Spanish smile and a lazy display of
white teeth as if my arrival was quite natural Don Enriquez of a
fact was not himself in the casa but was expected on the instant
Donna Urania was at home

Donna Urania For an instant I had forgotten that Mrs Saltillos
first name was Urania so pleasantly and spontaneously did it fall
from the Spanish lips Nor was I displeased at this chance of learning
something of Don Enriquezs fortunes and the Saltillo menage before
confronting my old friend The servant preceded me to the next floor
and opening a door ushered me into the ladys presence

I had carried with me on that upward climb a lively recollection of
Miss Mannersley as I had known her two years before I remembered her
upright almost stiff slight figure the graceful precision of her
poses the faultless symmetry and taste of her dress and the atmosphere
of a fastidious and wholesome cleanliness which exhaled from her In the
lady I saw before me half reclining in a rockingchair there was
none of the stiffness and nicety Habited in a loose gown of some easy
flexible but rich material worn with that peculiarly indolent
slouch of the Mexican woman Mrs Saltillo had parted with half her
individuality Even her arched feet and thin ankles the closefitting
boots or small slippers of which were wont to accent their delicacy
were now lost in a short lowquartered kid shoe of the Spanish type
in which they moved loosely Her hair which she had always worn with a
certain Greek simplicity was parted at one side Yet her face with
its regularity of feature and small thin redlipped mouth was quite
unchanged and her velvety brown eyes were as beautiful and inscrutable
as ever

With the same glance I had taken in her surroundings quite as
incongruous to her former habits The furniture though of old and heavy
mahogany had suffered from careless alien hands and was interspersed
with modern and unmatchable makeshifts yet preserving the distinctly
scant and formal attitude of furnished lodgings It was certainly
unlike the artistic trifles and delicate refinements of her uncles
drawingroom which we all knew her taste had dictated and ruled The
black and white engravings the outlined heads of Minerva and Diana
were excluded from the walls for two cheap colored Catholic printsa
soulless Virgin and the mystery of the Bleeding Heart Against the
wall in one corner hung the only object which seemed a memento of
their travelsa singularlooking upright Indian papoosecase or
cradle glaringly decorated with beads and paint probably an Aztec
relic On a round table the velvet cover of which showed marks of usage
and abusage there were scattered books and writing materials and my
editorial instinct suddenly recognized with a thrill of apprehension
the loose leaves of an undoubted manuscript This circumstance taken
with the fact of Donna Uranias hair being parted on one side and the
general negligee of her appearance was a disturbing revelation

My wandering eye apparently struck her for after the first greeting she
pointed to the manuscript with a smile

Yes that is THE manuscript I suppose Enriquez told you all about it
He said he had written

I was dumfounded I certainly had not understood ALL of Enriquezs
slang it was always so decidedly his own and peculiar Yet I could not
recall any allusion to this

He told me something of it but very vaguely I ventured to say
deprecatingly but I am afraid that I thought more of seeing my old
friend again than of anything else

During our stay in Mexico continued Mrs Saltillo with something of
her old precision I made some researches into Aztec history a subject
always deeply interesting to me and I thought I would utilize the
result by throwing it on paper Of course it is better fitted for a
volume of reference than for a newspaper but Enriquez thought you might
want to use it for your journal

I knew that Enriquez had no taste for literature and had even rather
depreciated it in the old days with his usual extravagance but I
managed to say very pleasantly that I was delighted with his suggestion
and should be glad to read the manuscript After all it was not
improbable that Mrs Saltillo who was educated and intelligent should
write well if not popularly Then Enriquez does not begrudge you the
time that your work takes from him I added laughingly You seem to
have occupied your honeymoon practically

We quite comprehend our respective duties said Mrs Saltillo dryly
and have from the first We have our own lives to live independent
of my uncle and Enriquezs father We have not only accepted the
responsibility of our own actions but we both feel the higher
privilege of creating our own conditions without extraneous aid from our
relatives

It struck me that this somewhat exalted statement was decidedly a pose
or a return of Urania Mannersleys old ironical style I looked quietly
into her brown nearsighted eyes but as once before my glance seemed
to slip from their moist surface without penetrating the inner thought
beneath And what does Enriquez do for HIS part I asked smilingly

I fully expected to hear that the energetic Enriquez was utilizing
his peculiar tastes and experiences by horsebreaking stockraising
professional bullfighting or even horseracing but was quite
astonished when she answered quietly

Enriquez is giving himself up to geology and practical metallurgy with
a view to scientific purely scientific mining

Enriquez and geology In that instant all I could remember of it were
his gibes at the geologian as he was wont to term Professor Dobbs
a former admirer of Miss Mannersleys To add to my confusion Mrs
Saltillo at the same moment absolutely voiced my thought

You may remember Professor Dobbs she went on calmly one of the most
eminent scientists over here and a very old Boston friend He has
taken Enriquez in hand His progress is most satisfactory we have the
greatest hopes of him

And how soon do you both hope to have some practical results of his
study I could not help asking a little mischievously for I somehow
resented the plural pronoun in her last sentence

Very soon said Mrs Saltillo ignoring everything but the question
You know Enriquezs sanguine temperament Perhaps he is already given
to evolving theories without a sufficient basis of fact Still he has
the daring of a discoverer His ideas of the oolitic formation are not
without originality and Professor Dobbs says that in his conception of
the Silurian beach there are gleams that are distinctly precious

I looked at Mrs Saltillo who had reinforced her eyes with her old
piquant pincenez but could detect no irony in them She was prettily
imperturbable that was all There was an awkward silence Then it was
broken by a bounding step on the stairs a wideopen fling of the door
and Enriquez pirouetted into the room Enriquez as of old unchanged
from the crown of his smooth coalblack hair to the tips of his small
narrow Arabian feet Enriquez with his thin curling mustache his
dancing eyes set in his immovable face just as I had always known him

He affected to lapse against the door for a minute as if staggered by a
resplendent vision Then he said

What do I regard Is it a dream or have I again got themthees
jimjams My best friend and my bestI mean my ONLYwife Embrace me

He gave me an enthusiastic embrace and a wink like sheetlightning
passed quickly to his wife before whom he dropped on one knee raised
the toe of her slipper to his lips and then sank on the sofa in
simulated collapse murmuring Thees is too mooch of white stone for
one day

Through all this I saw his wife regarding him with exactly the same
critically amused expression with which she had looked upon him in the
days of their strange courtship She evidently had not tired of his
extravagance and yet I feel as puzzled by her manner as then She rose
and said I suppose you have a good deal to say to each other and I
will leave you by yourselves Turning to her husband she added I
have already spoken about the Aztec manuscript

The word brought Enriquez to his feet again Ah The little old
niggeryou have read I began to understand My wife my best
friend and the little old nigger all in one day Eet is perfect
Nevertheless in spite of this ecstatic and overpowering combination
he hurried to take his wifes hand kissing it he led her to a door
opening into another room made her a low bow to the ground as she
passed out and then rejoined me

So these are the little old niggers you spoke of in your note I said
pointing to the manuscript Deuce take me if I understood you

Ah my leetle brother it is YOU who have changed said Enriquez
dolorously Is it that you no more understand American or have the
big head of the editor Regard me Of these Aztecs my wife have made
study She have pursued the little nigger to his cave his grotto where
he is dead a thousand year I have myself assist though I like it not
because thees mummy look you Pancho is not lively And the mummy who
is not dead believe me even the young lady mummy you shall not take
to your heart But my wifehe stopped and kissed his hand toward the
door whence she had flittedah SHE is wonderful She has made the
story of them the peecture of them from the life and on the instant
You shall take them my leetle brother for your journal you shall
announce in the big letter Mooch Importance The Aztec He is Found
How He Look and Lif The Everlasting Nigger You shall sell many
paper and Urania shall have scoop in much spondulics and rocks
Hoopla Foryou comprehendmy wife and I have settled that she shall
forgif her oncle I shall forgif my father but from them we take no
cent not a red not a scad We are independent Of ourselves we make a
Fourth of July United we stand divided we shall fall over There you
are Bueno

It was impossible to resist his wild yet perfectly sincere
extravagance his dancing black eyes and occasional flash of white teeth
in his otherwise immovable and serious countenance Nevertheless I
managed to say

But how about yourself Enriquez and this geology you know

His eyes twinkled Ah you shall hear But first you shall take a
drink I have the very old Bourbon He is not so old as the Aztec but
believe me he is very much liflier Attend Hol on He was already
rummaging on a shelf but apparently without success then he explored
a buffet with no better results and finally attacked a large drawer
throwing out on the floor with his old impetuosity a number of
geological specimens carefully labeled I picked up one that had rolled
near me It was labeled Conglomerate sandstone I picked up another
it had the same label

Then you are really collecting I said with astonishment

Ciertamente responded Enriquezwhat other fool shall I look I
shall relate of this geology when I shall have found this beast of a
bottle Ah here he have hide He extracted from a drawer a bottle
nearly full of spiritstippling was not one of Enriquezs vices You
shall say when Eres to our noble selfs

When he had drunk I picked up another fragment of his collection It
had the same label You are very rich in conglomerate sandstone I
said Where do you find it

In the street said Enriquez with great calmness

In the street I echoed

Yes my friend He ees call the cobblestone also the
poudingstone when he ees at his home in the country He ees also
a small boulder I pick him up I crack him he made three separate
piece of conglomerate sandstone I bring him home to my wife in my
pocket She rejoice we are happy When comes the efening I sit down
and make him a label while my wife she sit down and write of the
Aztec Ah my friend you shall say of the geology it ees a fine a
BEAUTIFUL study but the study of the wife and what shall please her
believe me ees much finer Believe your old Uncle Ennery every time
On thees question he gets there he gets left nevarre

But Professor Dobbs your geologian what does HE say to this frequent
recurrence of the conglomerate sandstone period in your study I asked
quickly

He say nothing You comprehend He ees a profound geologian but he
also has the admiration excessif for my wife Urania He stopped to kiss
his hand again toward the door and lighted a cigarette The geologian
would not that he should break up the happy efening of his friends
by thees small detail He put aside his headso he say A leetle
freestone a leetle granite now and then for variety they are
building in Montgomery Street I take the hint like a wink to the
horse that has gone blind I attach to myself part of the edifice that
is erecting himself in Montgomery Street I crack him I bring him
home I sit again at the feet of my beautiful Urania and I label him
Freestone Granite but I do not say from Parrotts Bankeet is
not necessary for our happiness

And you do this sort of thing only because you think it pleases your
wife I asked bluntly

My friend rejoined Enriquez perching himself on the back of the
sofa and caressing his knees as he puffed his cigarette meditatively
you have ask a conundrum Gif to me an easier one It is of truth that
I make much of these thing to please Urania But I shall confess all
Behold I appear to you my leetle brother in my camisamy shirt I
blow on myself I gif myself away

He rose gravely from the sofa and drew a small box from one of the
drawers of the wardrobe Opening it he discovered several specimens of
goldbearing quartz and one or two scales of gold Thees he said
friend Pancho is my own geology for thees I am what you see But I
say nothing to Urania for she have much disgust of mere goldof what
she calls vulgar miningand believe me a fear of the effect of
speculation upon my temperamentoyou comprehend my complexion my
brother Reflect upon it Pancho I who am the filosofo if that I am
anything He looked at me with great levity of eye and supernatural
gravity of demeanor But eet ees the jealous affection of the wife
my friend for which I make play to her with the humble leetle
poudingstone rather than the gold quartz that affrights

But what do you want with them if you have no shares in anything and
do not speculate I asked

Pardon That ees where you slip up my leetle friend He took from the
same drawer a clasped portfolio and unlocked it producing half a dozen
prospectuses and certificates of mining shares I stood aghast as I
recognized the names of one or two extravagant failures of the last ten
yearsplayedout mines that had been galvanized into deceptive life
in London Paris and New York to the grief of shareholders abroad
and the laughter of the initiated at home I could scarcely keep my
equanimity You do not mean to say that you have any belief or interest
in this rubbish I said quickly

What you call rubbish my good Pancho ees the rubbish that the
American speculator have dump himself upon them in the shaft the
rubbish of the advertisement of the extravagant expense of the salary
of the assessment of the freezeout For thees look you is the old
Mexican mine My grandfather and hees father have both seen them work
before you were born and the American knew not there was gold in
California

I knew he spoke truly One or two were original silver mines in the
south worked by peons and Indian slaves a rope windlass and a
venerable donkey

But those were silver mines I said suspiciously and these are gold
specimens

They are from the same mother said the imperturbable Enriquezthe
same mine The old peons worked him for SILVER the precious dollar that
buy everything that he send in the galleon to the Philippines for
the silk and spice THAT is good enough for HIM For the gold he made
nothing even as my leetle wife Urania And regard me here There ees a
proverb of my fathers which say that it shall take a gold mine to
work a silver mine so mooch more he cost You work him you are lost
Naturalmente if you turn him round if it take you only a silver mine
to work a gold mine you are gain Thees ees logic

The intense gravity of his face at this extraordinary deduction upset
my own But as I was never certain that Enriquez was not purposely
mystifying me with some ulterior object I could not help saying a
little wickedly

Yes I understand all that but how about this geologian Will he not
tell your wife You know he was a great admirer of hers

That shall show the great intelligence of him my Pancho He will have
the four Ss especially the secreto

There could be no serious discussion in his present mood I gathered up
the pages of his wifes manuscript said lightly that as she had the
first claim upon my time I should examine the Aztec material and report
in a day or two As I knew I had little chance in the hands of these two
incomprehensibles together I begged him not to call his wife but
to convey my adieus to her and in spite of his embraces and
protestations I managed to get out of the room But I had scarcely
reached the front door when I heard Enriquezs voice and his bounding
step on the stairs In another moment his arm was round my neck

You must return on the instant Mother of God I haf forget SHE haf
forget WE all haf forget But you have not seen him

Seen whom

El nino the baby You comprehend pig The criaturica the leetle
child of ourselfs

The baby I said confusedly IS thereis there a BABY

You hear him said Enriquez sending an appealing voice upward You
hear him Urania You comprehend This beast of a leetle brother demands
if there ees one

I beg your pardon I said hurriedly reascending the stairs On the
landing I met Mrs Saltillo but as calm composed and precise as
her husband was extravagant and vehement It was an oversight of
Enriquezs she said quietly reentering the room with us and was all
the more strange as the child was in the room with you all the time

She pointed to the corner of the wall where hung what I had believed
to be an old Indian relic To my consternation it WAS a bark
papoosecase occupied by a LIVING child swathed and bandaged after
the approved Indian fashion It was asleep I believe but it opened a
pair of bright huckleberry eyes set in the smallest of features that
were like those of a carved ivory idol and uttered a coo at the sound
of its mothers voice She stood on one side with unruffled composure
while Enriquez threw himself into an attitude before it with clasped
hands as if it had been an image of the Holy Child For myself I was
too astounded to speak luckily my confusion was attributed to the
inexperience of a bachelor

I have adopted said Mrs Saltillo with the faintest touch of
maternal pride in her manner what I am convinced is the only natural
and hygienic mode of treating the human child It may be said to be
a reversion to the aborigine but I have yet to learn that it is not
superior to our civilized custom By these bandages the limbs of the
infant are kept in proper position until they are strong enough to
support the body and such a thing as malformation is unknown It is
protected by its cradle which takes the place of its incubatingshell
from external injury the injudicious coddling of nurses the socalled
dancings and pernicious rockings The supine position as in the
adult is imposed only at night By the aid of this strap it may be
carried on long journeys either by myself or by Enriquez who thus
shares with me as he fully recognizes its equal responsibility and
burden

Itcertainly does notcry I stammered

Crying said Mrs Saltillo with a curve of her pretty red lip is
the protest of the child against insanitary and artificial treatment
In its upright unostentatious cradle it is protected against that
injudicious fondling and dangerous promiscuous osculation to which as
an infant in human arms it is so often subjected Above all it is kept
from that shameless and mortifying publicity so unjust to the weak and
unformed animal The child repays this consideration by a gratifying
silence It cannot be expected to understand our thoughts speech or
actions it cannot participate in our pleasures Why should it be
forced into premature contact with them merely to feed our vanity or
selfishness Why should we assume our particular parental accident
as superior to the common lot If we do not give our offspring that
prominence before our visitors so common to the young wife and husband
it is for that reason solely and this may account for what seemed the
forgetfulness of Enriquez in speaking of it or pointing it out to
you And I think his action in calling you back to see it was somewhat
precipitate As one does not usually introduce an unknown and inferior
stranger without some previous introduction he might have asked you if
you wished to see the baby before he recalled you

I looked from Uranias unfathomable eyes to Enriquezs impenetrable
countenance I might have been equal to either of them alone but
together they were invincible I looked hopelessly at the baby With
its sharp little eyes and composed face it certainly was a marvelous
miniature of Enriquez I said so

It would be singular if it was not said Mrs Saltillo dryly and as
I believe it is by no means an uncommon fact in human nature it seems
to me strange that people should insist upon it as a discovery It is
an inheritance however that in due time progress and science will no
doubt interrupt to the advancement of the human race I need not
say that both Enriquez and myself look forward to it with confident
tranquillity

There was clearly nothing for me to do now but to shake hands again and
take my leave Yet I was so much impressed with the unreality of the
whole scene that when I reached the front door I had a strong impulse
to return suddenly and fall in upon them in their relaxed and natural
attitudes They could not keep up this pose between themselves and I
half expected to see their laughing faces at the window as I glanced up
before wending my perilous way to the street

I found Mrs Saltillos manuscript well written and in the narrative
parts even graphic and sparkling I suppressed some general remarks
on the universe and some correlative theories of existence as
not appertaining particularly to the Aztecs and as not meeting any
unquenchable thirst for information on the part of the readers of the
Daily Excelsior I even promoted my fair contributor to the position
of having been commissioned at great expense to make the Mexican
journey especially for the Excelsior This with Mrs Saltillos
somewhat precise preraphaelite drawings and watercolors vilely
reproduced by woodcuts gave quite a sensational air to her production
which divided into parts for two or three days filled a whole page
of the paper I am not aware of any particular service that it did to
ethnology but as I pointed out in the editorial column it showed that
the people of California were not given over by material greed to the
exclusion of intellectual research and as it was attacked instantly
in long communications from one or two scientific men it thus produced
more copy

Briefly it was a boom for the author and the Daily Excelsior I
should add however that a rival newspaper intimated that it was also a
boom for Mrs Saitillos HUSBAND and called attention to the fact that
a deserted Mexican mine known as El Bolero was described graphically
in the Aztec article among the news and again appeared in the
advertising columns of the same paper I turned somewhat indignantly
to the file of the Excelsior and singularly enough found in the
elaborate prospectus of a new goldmining company the description of the
El Bolero mine as a QUOTATION from the Aztec article with extraordinary
inducements for the investment of capital in the projected working of an
old mine If I had had any difficulty in recognizing in the extravagant
style the flamboyant hand of Enriquez in English writing I might have
read his name plainly enough displayed as president of the company It
was evidently the prospectus of one of the ventures he had shown me I
was more amused than indignant at the little trick he had played upon
my editorial astuteness After all if I had thus benefited the young
couple I was satisfied I had not seen them since my first visit as I
was very busymy communications with Mrs Saltillo had been carried on
by letters and proofsand when I did finally call at their house it
was only to find that they were visiting at San Jose I wondered whether
the baby was still hanging on the wall or if he was taken with them
who carried him

A week later the stock of El Bolero was quoted at par More than that
an incomprehensible activity had been given to all the deserted Mexican
mines and people began to look up scrip hitherto thrown aside as
worthless Whether it was one of those extraordinary fevers which
attacked Californian speculation in the early days or whether Enriquez
Saltillo had infected the stockmarket with his own extravagance I
never knew but plans as wild inventions as fantastic and arguments
as illogical as ever emanated from his own brain were set forth on
Change with a gravity equal to his own The most reasonable hypothesis
was that it was the effect of the wellknown fact that the Spanish
Californian hitherto had not been a mining speculator nor connected
in any way with the gold production on his native soil deeming it
inconsistent with his patriarchal life and landed dignity and that when
a son of one of the oldest Spanish families identified with the land
and its peculiar character for centuries lent himself to its mineral
exploitationsI beg to say that I am quoting from the advertisement
in the Excelsiorit was a guerdon of success This was so far true
that in a week Enriquez Saltillo was rich and in a fair way to become a
millionaire


It was a hot afternoon when I alighted from the stifling Wingdam coach
and stood upon the cool deep veranda of the Carquinez Springs Hotel
After I had shaken off the dust which had lazily followed us in our
descent of the mountain road like a red smoke occasionally overflowing
the coach windows I went up to the room I had engaged for my brief
holiday I knew the place well although I could see that the hotel
itself had lately been redecorated and enlarged to meet the increasing
requirements of fashion I knew the forest of enormous redwoods where
one might lose ones self in a five minutes walk from the veranda I
knew the rocky trail that climbed the mountain to the springs twisting
between giant boulders I knew the arid garden deep in the wayside
dust with its hurriedly planted tropical plants already withering in
the dry autumn sunshine and washed into fictitious freshness night
and morning by the hydraulic irrigatinghose I knew too the cool
reposeful night winds that swept down from invisible snowcrests beyond
with the hanging out of monstrous stars that too often failed to bring
repose to the feverish guests For the overstrained neurotic workers
who fled hither from the baking plains of Sacramento or from the chill
seafogs of San Francisco never lost the fierce unrest that had driven
them here Unaccustomed to leisure their enforced idleness impelled
them to seek excitement in the wildest gayeties the bracing mountain
air only reinvigorated them to pursue pleasure as they had pursued the
occupations they had left behind Their sole recreations were furious
drives over breakneck roads mad scampering cavalcades through the
sedate woods gambling parties in private rooms where large sums were
lost by capitalists on leave champagne suppers and impromptu balls
that lasted through the calm reposeful night to the first rays of light
on the distant snowline Unimaginative men in their temporary sojourn
they more often outraged or dispossessed nature in her own fastnesses
than courted her for sympathy or solitude There were playingcards left
lying behind boulders and empty champagne bottles forgotten in forest
depths

I remembered all this when refreshed by a bath I leaned from the
balcony of my room and watched the pulling up of a brake drawn by six
dusty foambespattered horses driven by a noted capitalist As
its hot perspiring closely veiled yet burningfaced fair occupants
descended in all the dazzling glory of summer toilets and I saw the
gentlemen consult their watches with satisfaction and congratulate
their triumphant driver I knew the characteristic excitement they had
enjoyed from a record run probably for a bet over a mountain road in
a burning sun

Not bad eh Fortyfour minutes from the summit

The voice seemed at my elbow I turned quickly to recognize an
acquaintance a young San Francisco broker leaning from the next
balcony to mine But my attention was just then preoccupied by the face
and figure which seemed familiar to me of a woman who was alighting
from the brake

Who is that I asked the straight slim woman in gray with the white
veil twisted round her felt hat

Mrs Saltillo he answered wife of El Bolero Saltillo dont you
know Mighty pretty woman if she is a little stiffish and set up

Then I had not been mistaken Is Enriquezis her husbandhere I
asked quickly

The man laughed I reckon not This is the place for other peoples
husbands dont you know

Alas I DID know and as there flashed upon me all the miserable
scandals and gossip connected with this reckless frivolous caravansary
I felt like resenting his suggestion But my companions next words were
more significant

Besides if what they say is true Saltillo wouldnt be very popular
here

I dont understand I said quickly

Why after all that row he had with the El Bolero Company

I never heard of any row I said in astonishment

The broker laughed incredulously Come and YOU a newspaper man Well
maybe they DID try to hush it up and keep it out of the papers on
account of the stock But it seems he got up a reglar shindy with the
board one day called em thieves and swindlers and allowed he was
disgracing himself as a Spanish hidalgo by having anything to do with
em Talked they say about Charles V of Spain or some other royal
galoot giving his ancestors the land in trust Clean off his head
I reckon Then shunted himself off the company and sold out You can
guess he wouldnt be very popular around here with Jim Bestley there
pointing to the capitalist who had driven the brake who used to be on
the board with him No sir He was either lying low for something or
was off his head Think of his throwing up a place like that

Nonsense I said indignantly He is mercurial and has the quick
impulsiveness of his race but I believe him as sane as any who sat with
him on the board There must be some mistake or you havent got the
whole story Nevertheless I did not care to discuss an old friend
with a mere acquaintance and I felt secretly puzzled to account for his
conduct in the face of his previous cleverness in manipulating the El
Bolero and the undoubted fascination he had previously exercised over
the stockholders The story had of course been garbled in repetition
I had never before imagined what might be the effect of Enriquezs
peculiar eccentricities upon matteroffact peopleI had found them
only amusingand the brokers suggestion annoyed me However Mrs
Saltillo was here in the hotel and I should of course meet her Would
she be as frank with me

I was disappointed at not finding her in the drawingroom or on the
veranda and the heat being still unusually oppressive I strolled out
toward the redwoods hesitating for a moment in the shade before I ran
the fiery gauntlet of the garden To my surprise I had scarcely passed
the giant sentinels on its outskirts before I found that from some
unusual condition of the atmosphere the cold undercurrent of air
which generally drew through these pillared aisles was withheld that
afternoon it was absolutely hotter than in the open and the wood was
charged throughout with the acrid spices of the pine I turned back to
the hotel reascended to my bedroom and threw myself in an armchair by
the open window My room was near the end of a wing the corner room at
the end was next to mine on the same landing Its closed door at right
angles to my open one gave upon the staircase but was plainly visible
from where I sat I remembered being glad that it was shut as it
enabled me without offense to keep my own door open

The house was very quiet The leaves of a catalpa across the roadway
hung motionless Somebody yawned on the veranda below I threw away
my halffinished cigar and closed my eyes I think I had not lost
consciousness for more than a few seconds before I was awakened by the
shaking and thrilling of the whole building As I staggered to my feet
I saw the four pictures hanging against the wall swing outwardly from
it on their cords and my door swing back against the wall At the same
moment acted upon by the same potential impulse the door of the end
room in the hall opposite the stairs also swung open In that brief
moment I had a glimpse of the interior of the room of two figures a
man and a woman the latter clinging to her companion in abject terror
It was only for an instant for a second thrill passed through the
house the pictures clattered back against the wall the door of the end
room closed violently on its strange revelation and my own door swung
back also Apprehensive of what might happen I sprang toward it but
only to arrest it an inch or two before it should shut when as my
experience had taught me it might stick by the subsidence of the walls
But it did stick ajar and remained firmly fixed in that position From
the clattering of the knob of the other door and the sound of hurried
voices behind it I knew that the same thing had happened there when
that door had fully closed

I was familiar enough with earthquakes to know that with the second
shock or subsidence of the earth the immediate danger was passed and
so I was able to note more clearly what else was passing There was the
usual sudden stampede of hurrying feet the solitary oath and scream
the halfhysterical laughter and silence Then the tumult was
reawakened to the sound of high voices talking all together or the
impatient calling of absentees in halls and corridors Then I heard
the quick swish of female skirts on the staircase and one of the fair
guests knocked impatiently at the door of the end room still immovably
fixed At the first knock there was a sudden cessation of the hurried
whisperings and turning of the doorknob

Mrs Saltillo are you there Are you frightened she called

Mrs Saltillo It was SHE then who was in the room I drew nearer
my door which was still fixed ajar Presently a voiceMrs Saltillos
voicewith a constrained laugh in it came from behind the door Not
a bit Ill come down in a minute

Do persisted the wouldbe intruder Its all over now but were all
going out into the garden its safer

All right answered Mrs Saltillo Dont wait dear Ill follow Run
away now

The visitor who was evidently still nervous was glad to hurry away
and I heard her retreating step on the staircase The rattling of the
door began again and at last it seemed to yield to a stronger pull
and opened sufficiently to allow Mrs Saltillo to squeeze through I
withdrew behind my door I fancied that it creaked as she passed as if
noticing it ajar she had laid an inquiring hand upon it I waited but
she was not followed by any one I wondered if I had been mistaken I
was going to the bellrope to summon assistance to move my own door when
a sudden instinct withheld me If there was any one still in that room
he might come from it just as the servant answered my call and a public
discovery would be unavoidable I was right In another instant the
figure of a man whose face I could not discern slipped out of the
room passed my door and went stealthily down the staircase

Convinced of this I resolved not to call public attention to my being
in my own room at the time of the incident so I did not summon any one
but redoubling my efforts I at last opened the door sufficiently to
pass out and at once joined the other guests in the garden Already
with characteristic recklessness and audacity the earthquake was
made light of the only dictate of prudence had resolved itself into
a hilarious proposal to camp out in the woods all night and have
a torchlight picnic Even then preparations were being made for
carrying tents blankets and pillows to the adjacent redwoods dinner
and supper cooked at campfires were to be served there on stumps of
trees and fallen logs The convulsion of nature had been used as an
excuse for one of the wildest freaks of extravagance that Carquinez
Springs had ever known Perhaps that quick sense of humor which
dominates the American male in exigencies of this kind kept the
extravagances from being merely bizarre and grotesque and it was
presently known that the hotel and its menage were to be appropriately
burlesqued by some of the guests who attired as Indians would
personate the staff from the oracular hotel proprietor himself down to
the smart hotel clerk

During these arrangements I had a chance of drawing near Mrs Saltillo
I fancied she gave a slight start as she recognized me but her
greetings were given with her usual precision Have you been here
long she asked

I have only just come I replied laughingly in time for the shock

Ah you felt it then I was telling these ladies that our eminent
geologist Professor Dobbs assured me that these seismic disturbances
in California have a very remote centre and are seldom serious

It must be very satisfactory to have the support of geology at such a
moment I could not help saying though I had not the slightest idea
whose the figure was that I had seen nor indeed had I recognized
it among the guests She did not seem to detect any significance in
my speech and I added And where is Enriquez He would enjoy this
proposed picnic tonight

Enriquez is at Salvatierra Rancho which he lately bought from his
cousin

And the baby Surely here is a chance for you to hang him up on a
redwood tonight in his cradle

The boy said Mrs Saltillo quickly is no longer in his cradle he
has passed the pupa state and is now free to develop his own perfected
limbs He is with his father I do not approve of children being
submitted to the indiscriminate attentions of a hotel I am here myself
only for that supply of ozone indicated for brain exhaustion

She looked so pretty and prim in her gray dress so like her old correct
self that I could not think of anything but her mental attitude which
did not by the way seem much like mental depression Yet I was aware
that I was getting no information of Enriquezs condition or affairs
unless the whole story told by the broker was an exaggeration I did
not however dare to ask more particularly

You remember Professor Dobbs she asked abruptly

This recalled a suspicion awakened by my vision so suddenly that I
felt myself blushing She did not seem to notice it and was perfectly
composed

I do remember him Is he here

He is that is what makes it so particularly unfortunate for me You
see after that affair of the board and Enriquezs withdrawal although
Enriquez may have been a little precipitate in his energetic way I
naturally took my husbands part in public for although we preserve
our own independence inviolable we believe in absolute confederation as
against society

But what has Professor Dobbs to do with the board I interrupted

The professor was scientific and geological adviser to the board and
it was upon some report or suggestion of his that Enriquez took issue
against the sentiment of the board It was a principle affecting
Enriquezs Spanish sense of honor

Do tell me all about it I said eagerly I am very anxious to know
the truth

As I was not present at the time said Mrs Saltillo rebuking my
eagerness with a gentle frigidity I am unable to do so Anything else
would be mere hearsay and more or less ex parte I do not approve of
gossip

But what did Enriquez tell you You surely know that

THAT being purely confidential as between husband and wifeperhaps
I should say partner and partnerof course you do not expect me to
disclose Enough that I was satisfied with it I should not have spoken
to you about it at all but that through myself and Enriquez you are
an acquaintance of the professors and I might save you the awkwardness
of presenting yourself with him Otherwise although you are a friend of
Enriquez it need not affect your acquaintance with the professor

Hang the professor I ejaculated I dont care a rap for HIM

Then I differ with you said Mrs Saltillo with precision He is
distinctly an able man and one cannot but miss the contact of his
original mind and his liberal teachings

Here she was joined by one of the ladies and I lounged away I dare say
it was very mean and very illogical but the unsatisfactory character
of this interview made me revert again to the singular revelation I had
seen a few hours before I looked anxiously for Professor Dobbs but
when I did meet him with an indifferent nod of recognition I found
I could by no means identify him with the figure of her mysterious
companion And why should I suspect him at all in the face of Mrs
Saltillos confessed avoidance of him Who then could it have been I
had seen them but an instant in the opening and the shutting of a door
It was merely the shadowy bulk of a man that flitted past my door
after all Could I have imagined the whole thing Were my perceptive
facultiesjust aroused from slumber too insufficiently clear to be
relied upon Would I not have laughed had Urania or even Enriquez
himself told me such a story

As I reentered the hotel the clerk handed me a telegram Theres been
a pretty big shake all over the country he said eagerly Everybody
is getting news and inquiries from their friends Anything fresh He
paused interrogatively as I tore open the envelope The dispatch had
been redirected from the office of the Daily Excelsior It was dated
Salvatierra Rancho and contained a single line Come and see your
old uncle Ennery

There was nothing in the wording of the message that was unlike
Enriquezs usual lighthearted levity but the fact that he should have
TELEGRAPHED it to me struck me uneasily That I should have received it
at the hotel where his wife and Professor Dobbs were both staying and
where I had had such a singular experience seemed to me more than a
mere coincidence An instinct that the message was something personal
to Enriquez and myself kept me from imparting it to Mrs Saltillo After
worrying half the night in our bizarre camp in the redwoods in the
midst of a restless festivity which was scarcely the repose I had been
seeking at Carquinez Springs I resolved to leave the next day for
Salvatierra Rancho I remembered the ranchoa low goldenbrown
adobewalled quadrangle sleeping like some monstrous ruminant in a
hollow of the Contra Costa Range I recalled in the midst of this noisy
picnic the slumberous coolness of its long corridors and soundless
courtyard and hailed it as a relief The telegram was a sufficient
excuse for my abrupt departure In the morning I left but without again
seeing either Mrs Saltillo or the professor

It was late the next afternoon when I rode through the canada that led
to the rancho I confess my thoughts were somewhat gloomy in spite of
my escape from the noisy hotel but this was due to the sombre scenery
through which I had just ridden and the monotonous russet of the
leagues of wild oats As I approached the rancho I saw that Enriquez
had made no attempt to modernize the old casa and that even the garden
was left in its lawless native luxuriance while the rude tiled sheds
near the walled corral contained the old farming implements unchanged
for a century even to the oxcarts the wheels of which were made of a
single block of wood A few peons in striped shirts and velvet
jackets were sunning themselves against a wall and near them hung
a halfdrained pellejo or goatskin waterbag The air of absolute
shiftlessness must have been repellent to Mrs Saltillos orderly
precision and for a moment I pitied her But it was equally
inconsistent with Enriquezs enthusiastic ideas of American progress
and the extravagant designs he had often imparted to me of the
improvements he would make when he had a fortune I was feeling uneasy
again when I suddenly heard the rapid clack of unshod hoofs on a rocky
trail that joined my own At the same instant a horseman dashed past me
at full speed I had barely time to swerve my own horse aside to avoid a
collision yet in that brief moment I recognized the figure of Enriquez
But his face I should have scarcely known It was hard and fixed His
upper lip and thin penciled mustache were drawn up over his teeth
which were like a white gash in his dark face He turned into the
courtyard of the rancho I put spurs to my horse and followed in
nervous expectation He turned in his saddle as I entered But the next
moment he bounded from his horse and before I could dismount flew to
my side and absolutely lifted me from the saddle to embrace me It was
the old Enriquez again his face seemed to have utterly changed in that
brief moment

This is all very well old chap I said but do you know that you
nearly ran me down just now with that infernal halfbroken mustang Do
you usually charge the casa at that speed

Pardon my leetle brother But here you shall slip up The mustang is
not HALFbroken he is not broke at all Look at his hoofnever have
a shoe been there For myselfattend me When I ride alone I
think mooch when I think mooch I think fast my idea he go like a
cannonball Consequent if I ride not thees horse like the cannonball
my thought HE arrive first and where are you You get left Believe
me that I fly thees horse thees old Mexican plug and your de uncle
Ennery and his leetle old idea arrive all the same time and on the
instant

It WAS the old Enriquez I perfectly understood his extravagant speech
and illustration and yet for the first time I wondered if others did

Takadrink he said all in one word You shall possess the old
Bourbon or the rhum from the Santa Cruz Name your poison gentlemen

He had already dragged me up the steps from the patio to the veranda
and seated me before a small round table still covered with the
chocolate equipage of the morning A little driedup old Indian woman
took it away and brought the spirits and glasses

Mirar the leetle old one said Enriquez with unflinching gravity
Consider her Pancho to the bloosh She is not truly an Aztec but
she is of years one hundred and one and LIFS Possibly she haf not the
beauty which ravishes which devastates But she shall attent you to the
hot water to the bath Thus shall you be protect my leetle brother
from scandal

Enriquez I burst out suddenly tell me about yourself Why did you
leave the El Bolero board What was the row about

Enriquezs eyes for a moment glittered then they danced as before

Ah he said you have heard

Something but I want to know the truth from you

He lighted a cigarette lifted himself backward into a grass hammock on
which he sat swinging his feet Then pointing to another hammock he
said Tranquillize yourself there I will relate but truly it ees
nothing

He took a long pull at his cigarette and for a few moments
seemed quietly to exude smoke from his eyes ears nose even his
fingerendseverywhere in fact but his mouth That and his mustache
remained fixed Then he said slowly flicking away the ashes with his
little finger

First you understand friend Pancho that I make no row The other
themself make the row the shindig They make the dance the howl the
snap of the finger the oath the Helen blazes the Wot the devil
the That be dd the bad language they themselves finger the
revolver advance the bowieknife throw off the coat square off and
say Come on I remain as you see me now little brothertranquil
He lighted another cigarette made his position more comfortable in the
hammock and resumed The Professor Dobbs who is the geologian of the
company made a report for which he got two thousand dollar But thees
reportlook you friend Panchohe is not good for the mine For in the
hole in the ground the Professor Dobbs have found a hoss

A what I asked

A hoss repeated Enriquez with infinite gravity But not leetle
Pancho the hoss that run the hoss that buckjump but what the miner
call a hoss a something that rear up in the vein and stop him You
pick around the hoss you pick under him sometimes you find the vein
sometimes you do not The hoss rear up and remain Eet ees not good for
the mine The board say D the hoss Get rid of the hoss Chuck
out the hoss Then they talk together and one say to the Professor
Dobbs Eef you cannot thees hoss remove from the mine you can take
him out of the report He look to me thees professor I see nothing I
remain tranquil Then the board say Thees report with the hoss in
him is worth two thousand dollar but WITHOUT the hoss he is worth five
thousand dollar For the stockholder is frighted of the rearing hoss It
is of a necessity that the stockholder should remain tranquil Without
the hoss the report is good the stock shall errise the director
shall sell out and leave the stockholder the hoss to play with The
professor he say Alright he scratch out the hoss sign his name
and get a check for three thousand dollar

Then I erriseso He got up from the hammock suiting the action
to the word and during the rest of his narrative I honestly believe
assumed the same attitude and deliberate intonation he had exhibited at
the board I could even fancy I saw the reckless cynical faces of
his brother directors turned upon his grim impassive features I am
tranquil I smoke my cigarette I say that for three hundred year my
family have held the land of thees mine that it pass from father to
son and from son to son it pass by gift it pass by grant but that
NEVARRE THERE PASS A LIE WITH IT I say it was a gift by a Spanish
Christian king to a Christian hidalgo for the spread of the gospel and
not for the cheat and the swindle I say that this mine was worked
by the slave and by the mule by the ass but never by the cheat and
swindler I say that if they have struck the hoss in the mine they have
struck a hoss IN THE LAND a Spanish hoss a hoss that have no bridle
worth five thousand dollar in his mouth but a hoss to rear and a
hoss that cannot be struck out by a Yankee geologian and that hoss is
Enriquez Saltillo

He paused and laid aside his cigarette

Then they say Dry up and Sell out and the great bankers say
Name your own price for your stock and resign And I say There is
not enough gold in your bank in your San Francisco in the mines of
California that shall buy a Spanish gentleman When I leave I leave
the stock at my back I shall take it nevarre Then the banker he say
And you will go and blab I suppose And then Pancho I smile I
pick up my mustacheso and I say Pardon senor you haf mistake The
Saltillo haf for three hundred year no stain no blot upon him Eet is
not nowthe last of the racewho shall confess that he haf sit at a
board of disgrace and dishonor And then it is that the band begin to
play and the animals stand on their hind leg and waltz and behold the
row he haf begin

I ran over to him and fairly hugged him But he put me aside with
a gentle and philosophical calm Ah eet is nothing Pancho It is
believe me all the same a hundred years to come and where are you
then The earth he turn round and then come el temblor the earthquake
and there you are Bah eet is not of the board that I have asked you
to come it is something else I would tell you Go and wash yourself
of thees journey my leetle brother as I havelooking at his narrow
brown wellbred handswash myself of the board Be very careful of
the leetle old woman Pancho do not wink to her of the eye Consider
my leetle brother for one hundred and one year he haf been as a nun a
saint Disturb not her tranquillity

Yes it was the old Enriquez but he seemed graverif I could use that
word of one of such persistent gravity only his gravity heretofore had
suggested a certain irony rather than a melancholy which I now fancied I
detected And what was this something else he was to tell me later
Did it refer to Mrs Saltillo I had purposely waited for him to speak
of her before I should say anything of my visit to Carquinez Springs
I hurried through my ablutions in the hot water brought in a bronze jar
on the head of the centenarian handmaid and even while I was smiling
over Enriquezs caution regarding this aged Ruth I felt I was getting
nervous to hear his news

I found him in his sittingroom or studya long low apartment with
small deep windows like embrasures in the outer adobe wall but glazed
in lightly upon the veranda He was sitting quite abstractedly with a
pen in his hand before a table on which a number of sealed envelopes
were lying He looked SO formal and methodical for Enriquez

You like the old casa Pancho he said in reply to my praise of its
studious and monastic gloom Well my leetle brother some day that is
fairwho knowsit may be at your disposicion not of our politeness
but of a truth friend Pancho For if I leave it to my wifeit was
the first time he had spoken of herfor my leetle child he added
quickly I shall put in a bond an obligacion that my friend Pancho
shall come and go as he will

The Saltillos are a longlived race I laughed I shall be a
grayhaired man with a house and family of my own by that time But I
did not like the way he had spoken

Quien sabe he only said dismissing the question with the national
gesture After a moment he added I shall tell you something that is
strrange so strrange that you shall say like the banker say Thees
Enriquez he ees off his head he ees a crank a lunatico but it ees a
FACT believe me I have said

He rose and going to the end of the room opened a door It showed
a pretty little room femininely arranged in Mrs Saltillos refined
taste Eet is pretty eet is the room of my wife Bueno attend me
now He closed the door and walked back to the table I have sit here
and write when the earthquake arrive I have feel the shock the grind
of the walls on themselves the tremor the stagger andthatdoorhe
swing open

The door I said with a smile that I felt was ghastly

Comprehend me he said quickly it ees not THAT which ees strrange
The wall lift the lock slip the door he fell open it is frequent it
comes so ever when the earthquake come But eet is not my wifes room
I see it is ANOTHER ROOM a room I know not My wife Urania she stand
there of a fear of a tremble she grasp she cling to someone The
earth shake again the door shut I jump from my table I shake and
tumble to the door I fling him open Maravilloso it is the room of my
wife again She is NOT there it is empty it is nothing

I felt myself turning hot and cold by turns I was horrified andand I
blundered And who was the other figure I gasped

Who repeated Enriquez with a pause a fixed look at me and a
sublime gesture Who SHOULD it be but myself Enriquez Saltillo

A terrible premonition that this was a chivalrous LIE that it was NOT
himself he had seen but that our two visions were identical came upon
me After all I said with a fixed smile if you could imagine you
saw your wife you could easily imagine you saw yourself too In the
shock of the moment you thought of HER naturally for then she would as
naturally seek your protection You have written for news of her

No said Enriquez quietly

No I repeated amazedly

You understand Pancho Eef it was the trick of my eyes why should
I affright her for the thing that is not If it is the truth and it
arrive to ME as a warning why shall I affright her before it come

Before WHAT comes What is it a warning of I asked impetuously

That we shall be separated That I go and she do not

To my surprise his dancing eyes had a slight film over them I dont
understand you I said awkwardly

Your head is not of a level my Pancho Thees earthquake he remain for
only ten seconds and he fling open the door If he remain for twenty
seconds he fling open the wall the hoose toomble and your friend
Enriquez is feenish

Nonsense I said ProfessorI mean the geologistssay that the
centre of disturbance of these Californian earthquakes is some faraway
point in the Pacific and there never will be any serious convulsions
here

Ah the geologist said Enriquez gravely understand the hoss that
rear in the mine and the five thousand dollar believe me no more
He haf lif here three year My family haf lif here three hundred My
grandfather saw the earth swallow the church of San Juan Baptista

I laughed until looking up I was shocked to see for the first time
that his dancing eyes were moist and shining But almost instantly he
jumped up and declared that I had not seen the garden and the corral
and linking his arm in mine swept me like a whirlwind into the patio
For an hour or two he was in his old invincible spirits I was glad
I had said nothing of my visit to Carquinez Springs and of seeing his
wife I determined to avoid it as long as possible and as he did not
again refer to her except in the past it was not difficult At last
he infected me with his extravagance and for a while I forgot even the
strangeness of his conduct and his confidences We walked and talked
together as of old I understood and enjoyed him perfectly and it
was not strange that in the end I began to believe that this strange
revelation was a bit of his extravagant acting got up to amuse me The
coincidence of his story with my own experience was not after all
such a wonderful thing considering what must have been the nervous
and mental disturbance produced by the earthquake We dined together
attended only by Pedro an old halfcaste bodyservant It was easy to
see that the household was carried on economically and from a word
or two casually dropped by Enriquez it appeared that the rancho and
a small sum of money were all that he retained from his former fortune
when he left the El Bolero The stock he kept intact refusing to take
the dividend upon it until that collapse of the company should occur
which he confidently predicted when he would make good the swindled
stockholders I had no reason to doubt his perfect faith in this

The next morning we were up early for a breezy gallop over the three
square miles of Enriquezs estate I was astounded when I descended to
the patio to find Enriquez already mounted and carrying before him
astride of the horn of his saddle a small childthe identical papoose
of my memorable first visit But the boy was no longer swathed and
bandaged although for security his plump little body was engirt by
the same sash that encircled his fathers own waist I felt a stirring
of selfreproach I had forgotten all about him To my suggestion
that the exercise might be fatiguing to him Enriquez shrugged his
shoulders

Believe me no He is ever with me when I go on the pasear He is not
too yonge For he shall learn to rride to shoot and to speak the
truth even as the Persian chile Eet ees all I can gif to him

Nevertheless I think the boy enjoyed it and I knew he was safe with
such an accomplished horseman as his father Indeed it was a fine sight
to see them both careering over the broad plain Enriquez with jingling
spurs and whirling riata and the boy with a face as composed as his
fathers and his tiny hand grasping the end of the flapping rein with
a touch scarcely lighter than the skillful riders own It was a lovely
morning though warm and still there was a faint hazea rare thing in
that climateon the distant range The sunbaked soil arid and thirsty
from the long summer drought and cracked into long fissures broke
into puffs of dust with a slight detonation like a pistolshot at each
stroke of our pounding hoofs Suddenly my horse swerved in full gallop
almost lost his footing broke and halted with braced fore feet
trembling in every limb I heard a shout from Enriquez at the same
instant and saw that he too had halted about a hundred paces from me
with his hand uplifted in warning and between us a long chasm in the
dry earth extending across the whole field But the trembling of the
horse continued until it communicated itself to me I was shaking
too and looking about for the cause when I beheld the most weird and
remarkable spectacle I had ever witnessed The whole llano or plain
stretching to the horizonline was DISTINCTLY UNDULATING The faint
haze of the hills was repeated over its surface as if a dust had arisen
from some grinding displacement of the soil I threw myself from my
horse but the next moment was fain to cling to him as I felt the
thrill under my very feet Then there was a pause and I lifted my
head to look for Enriquez He was nowhere to be seen With a terrible
recollection of the fissure that had yawned between us I sprang to the
saddle again and spurred the frightened beast toward that point BUT
IT WAS GONE TOO I rode backward and forward repeatedly along the line
where I had seen it only a moment before The plain lay compact and
uninterrupted without a crack or fissure The dusty haze that had
arisen had passed as mysteriously away the clear outline of the valley
returned the great field was empty

Presently I was aware of the sound of galloping hoofs I remembered
thenwhat I had at first forgottenthat a few moments before we had
crossed an arroyo or dried bed of a stream depressed below the level
of the field How foolish that I had not remembered He had evidently
sought that refuge there were his returning hoofs I galloped toward
it but only to meet a frightened vaquero who had taken that avenue of
escape to the rancho

Did you see Don Enriquez I asked impatiently

I saw that the mans terror was extreme and his eyes were staring in
their sockets He hastily crossed himself

Ah God yes

Where is he I demanded

Gone

Where

He looked at me with staring vacant eyes and pointing to the ground
said in Spanish He has returned to the land of his fathers

We searched for him that day and the next when the country was aroused
and his neighbors joined in a quest that proved useless Neither he
nor his innocent burden was ever seen again of men Whether he had been
engulfed by mischance in some unsuspected yawning chasm in that brief
moment or had fulfilled his own prophecy by deliberately erasing
himself for some purpose known only to himself no one ever knew His
countrypeople shook their heads and said it was like a Saltillo And
the few among his retainers who knew him and loved him whispered
still more ominously He will yet return to his land to confound the
Americanos

Yet the widow of Enriquez did NOT marry Professor Dobbs But she too
disappeared from California and years afterward I was told that she was
well known to the ingenuous Parisians as the usual wealthy widow from
South America
