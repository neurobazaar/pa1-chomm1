BALLADE OF THE PRIMITIVE JEST

What did the darkhaired Iberian laugh at before the tall blonde
Aryan drove him into the corners of EuropeBrander Matthews

I am an ancient Jest
Palaeolithic man
In his arboreal nest
The sparks of fun would fan
My outline did he plan
And laughed like one possessed
Twas thus my course began
I am a Merry Jest

I am an early Jest
Man delved and built and span
Then wandered South and West
The peoples Aryan
I journeyed in their van
The Semites too confessed
From Beersheba to Dan
I am a Merry Jest

I am an ancient Jest
Through all the human clan
Red black white free oppressed
Hilarious I ran
Im found in Lucian
In Poggio and the rest
Im dear to Moll and Nan
I am a Merry Jest

ENVOY
Prince you may storm and ban
Joe Millers are a pest
Suppress me if you can
I am a Merry Jest

Andrew Lang 18441912




THE KINDLY MUSE




TIME TO BE WISE

Yes I write verses now and then
But blunt and flaccid is my pen
No longer talked of by young men
As rather clever
In the last quarter are my eyes
You see it by their form and size
Is it not time then to be wise
Or now or never

Fairest that ever sprang from Eve
While Time allows the short reprieve
Just look at me would you believe
Twas once a lover
I cannot clear the fivebar gate
But trying first its timbers state
Climb stiffly up take breath and wait
To trundle over

Through gallopade I cannot swing
The entangling blooms of Beautys spring
I cannot say the tender thing
Bet true or false
And am beginning to opine
Those girls are only halfdivine
Whose waists yon wicked boys entwine
In giddy waltz

I fear that arm above that shoulder
I wish them wiser graver older
Sedater and no harm if colder
And panting less
Ah people were not half so wild
In former days when starchly mild
Upon her highheeled Essex smiled
The brave Queen Bess

Walter Savage Landor 17751864




UNDER THE LINDENS

Under the lindens lately sat
A couple and no more in chat
I wondered what they would be at
Under the lindens

I saw four eyes and four lips meet
I heard the words How sweet how sweet
Had then the Fairies given a treat
Under the lindens

I pondered long and could not tell
What dainty pleased them both so well
Bees bees was it your hydromel
Under the lindens

Walter Savage Landor 17751864




ADVICE

To write as your sweet mother does
Is all you wish to do
Play sing and smile for others Rose
Let others write for you

Or mount again your Dartmoor gray
And I will walk beside
Until we reach that quiet bay
Which only hears the tide

Then wave at me your pencil then
At distance bid me stand
Before the caverned cliff again
The creature of your hand

And bid me then go past the nook
To sketch me less in size
There are but few content to look
So little in your eyes

Delight us with the gifts you have
And wish for none beyond
To some be gay to some be grave
To one blest youth be fond

Pleasures there are how close to Pain
And better unpossessed
Let poetrys too throbbing vein
Lie quiet in your breast

Walter Savage Landor 17751864




TO FANNY

Never mind how the pedagogue proses
You want not antiquitys stamp
The lip that such fragrance discloses
Oh never should smell of the lamp

Old Chloe whose withering kisses
Have long set the Loves at defiance
Now done with the science of blisses
May fly to the blisses of science

Young Sappho for want of employments
Alone oer her Ovid may melt
Condemned but to read of enjoyments
Which wiser Corinna had felt

But for you to be buried in books
Oh Fanny theyre pitiful sages
Who could not in one of your looks
Read more than in millions of pages

Astronomy finds in your eyes
Better light than she studies above
And Music must borrow your sighs
As the melody fittest for Love

In Ethicstis you that can check
In a minute their doubts and their quarrels
Oh show but that mole on your neck
And twill soon put an end to their morals

Your Arithmetic only can trip
When to kiss and to count you endeavor
But eloquence glows on your lip
When you swear that youll love me for ever

Thus you see what a brilliant alliance
Of arts is assembled in you
A course of more exquisite science
Man never need wish to pursue

And ohif a Fellow like me
May confer a diploma of hearts
With my lip thus I seal your degree
My divine little Mistress of Arts

Thomas Moore 17791852




ID BE A BUTTERFLY

Id be a Butterfly born in a bower
Where roses and lilies and violets meet
Roving for ever from flower to flower
And kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet
Id never languish for wealth or for power
Id never sigh to see slaves at my feet
Id be a Butterfly born in a bower
Kissing all buds that are pretty and sweet

O could I pilfer the wand of a fairy
Id have a pair of those beautiful wings
Their summer days ramble is sportive and airy
They sleep in a rose when the nightingale sings
Those who have wealth must be watchful and wary
Power alas naught but misery brings
Id be a Butterfly sportive and airy
Rocked in a rose when the nightingale sings

What though you tell me each gay little rover
Shrinks from the breath of the first autumn day
Surely tis better when summer is over
To die when all fair things are fading away
Some in lifes winter may toil to discover
Means of procuring a weary delay
Id be a butterfly living a rover
Dying when fair things are fading away

Thomas Haynes Bayly 17971839




IM NOT A SINGLE MAN
Lines Written In A Young Ladys Album

A pretty task Miss S to ask
A Benedictine pen
That cannot quite at freedom write
Like those of other men
No lovers plaint my Muse must paint
To fill this pages span
But be correct and recollect
Im not a single man

Pray only think for pen and ink
How hard to get along
That may not turn on words that burn
Or Love the life of song
Nine Muses if I chooses I
May woo all in a clan
But one Miss S I darent address
Im not a single man

Scribblers unwed with little head
May eke it out with heart
And in their lays it often plays
A rare firstfiddle part
They make a kiss to rhyme with bliss
But if I so began
I have my fears about my ears
Im not a single man

Upon your cheek I may not speak
Nor on your lip be warm
I must be wise about your eyes
And formal with your form
Of all that sort of thing in short
On T H Baylys plan
I must not twine a single line
Im not a single man

A watchmans part compels my heart
To keep you off its beat
And I might dare as soon to swear
At you as at your feet
I cant expire in passions fire
As other poets can
My life shes by wont let me die
Im not a single man

Shut out from love denied a dove
Forbidden bow and dart
Without a groan to call my own
With neither hand nor heart
To Hymen vowed and not allowed
To flirt een with your fan
Here end as just a friend I must
Im not a single man

Thomas Hood 17991845




TO

We met but in one giddy dance
Goodnight joined hands with greeting
And twenty thousand things may chance
Before our second meeting
For oh I have been often told
That all the world grows older
And hearts and hopes today so cold
Tomorrow must be colder

If I have never touched the string
Beneath your chamber dear one
And never said one civil thing
When you were by to hear one
If I have made no rhymes about
Those looks which conquer Stoics
And heard those angel tones without
One fit of fair heroics

Yet do not though the worlds cold school
Some bitter truths has taught me
Oh do not deem me quite the fool
Which wiser friends have thought me
There is one charm I still could feel
If no one laughed at feeling
One dream my lute could still reveal
If it were worth revealing

But Folly little cares what name
Of friend or foe she handles
When merriment directs the game
And midnight dims the candles
I know that Follys breath is weak
And would not stir a feather
But yet I would not have her speak
Your name and mine together

Oh no this life is dark and bright
Half rapture and half sorrow
My heart is very full tonight
My cup shall be tomorrow
But they shall never know from me
On any one condition
Whose health made bright my Burgundy
Whose beauty was my vision

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839




THE VICAR

Some years ago ere Time and Taste
Had turned our parish topsyturvy
When Darnel Park was Darnel Waste
And roads as little known as scurvy
The man who lost his way between
St Marys Hill and Sandy Thicket
Was always shown across the Green
And guided to the Parsons wicket

Back flew the bolt of lissom lath
Fair Margaret in her tidy kirtle
Led the lorn traveller up the path
Through cleanclipt rows of box and myrtle
And Don and Sancho Tramp and Tray
Upon the parlor steps collected
Wagged all their tails and seemed to say
Our master knows you youre expected

Up rose the Reverend Doctor Brown
Up rose the Doctors winsome marrow
The lady laid her knitting down
Her husband clasped his ponderous Barrow
Whateer the strangers caste or creed
Pundit or papist saint or sinner
He found a stable for his steed
And welcome for himself and dinner

If when he reached his journeys end
And warmed himself in court or college
He had not gained an honest friend
And twenty curious scraps of knowledge
If he departed as he came
With no new light on love or liquor
Good sooth the traveller was to blame
And not the Vicarage nor the Vicar

His talk was like a stream which runs
With rapid change from rocks to roses
It slipped from politics to puns
It passed from Mahomet to Moses
Beginning with the laws which keep
The planets in their radiant courses
And ending with some precept deep
For dressing eels or shoeing horses

He was a shrewd and sound divine
Of loud Dissent the mortal terror
And when by dint of page and line
He stablished Truth or startled Error
The Baptist found him far too deep
The Deist sighed with saving sorrow
And the lean Levite went to sleep
And dreamed of tasting pork tomorrow

His sermon never said or showed
That Earth is foul that Heaven is gracious
Without refreshment on the road
From Jerome or from Athanasius
And sure a righteous zeal inspired
The hand and head that penned and planned them
For all who understood admired
And some who did not understand them

He wrote too in a quiet way
Small treatises and smaller verses
And sage remarks on chalk and clay
And hints to noble lords and nurses
True histories of last years ghost
Lines to a ringlet or a turban
And trifles to the Morning Post
And nothings for Sylvanus Urban

He did not think all mischief fair
Although he had a knack of joking
He did not make himself a bear
Although he had a taste for smoking
And when religious sects ran mad
He held in spite of all his learning
That if a mans belief is bad
It will not be improved by burning

And he was kind and loved to sit
In the low hut or garnished cottage
And praise the farmers homely wit
And share the widows homelier pottage
At his approach complaint grew mild
And when his hand unbarred the shutter
The clammy lips of Fever smiled
The welcome which they could not utter

He always had a tale for me
Of Julius Caesar or of Venus
From him I learned the rule of three
Catscradle leapfrog and Quae genus
I used to singe his powdered wig
To steal the staff he put such trust in
And make the puppy dance a jig
When he began to quote Augustine

Alack the change In vain I look
For haunts in which my boyhood trifled
The level lawn the trickling brook
The trees I climbed the beds I rifled
The church is larger than before
You reach it by a carriage entry
It holds three hundred people more
And pews are fitted up for gentry

Sit in the Vicars seat youll hear
The doctrine of a gentle Johnian
Whose hand is white whose voice is clear
Whose phrase is very Ciceronian
Where is the old man laid Look down
And construe on the slab before you
Hic jacet Gulielmus Brown
Vir nulla non donandus lauru

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839




THE BELLE OF THE BALLROOM

Years years ago ere yet my dreams
Had been of being wise or witty
Ere I had done with writing themes
Or yawned oer this infernal Chitty
Years years ago while all my joy
Were in my fowlingpiece and filly
In short while I was yet a boy
I fell in love with Laura Lilly

I saw her at the County Ball
There when the sounds of flute and fiddle
Gave signal sweet in that old hall
Of hands across and down the middle
Hers was the subtlest spell by far
Of all that sets young hearts romancing
She was our queen our rose our star
And then she dancedoh heaven her dancing

Dark was her hair her hand was white
Her voice was exquisitely tender
Her eyes were full of liquid light
I never saw a waist so slender
Her every look her every smile
Shot right and left a score of arrows
I thought twas Venus from her isle
And wondered where shed left her sparrows

She talked of politics or prayers
Of Southeys prose or Wordsworths sonnets
Of danglers or of dancing bears
Of battles or the last new bonnets
By candlelight at twelve oclock
To me it mattered not a tittle
If those bright lips had quoted Locke
I might have thought they murmured Little

Through sunny May through sultry June
I loved her with a love eternal
I spoke her praises to the moon
I wrote them to the Sunday Journal
My mother laughed I soon found out
That ancient ladies have no feeling
My father frowned but how should gout
See any happiness in kneeling

She was the daughter of a dean
Rich fat and rather apoplectic
She had one brother just thirteen
Whose color was extremely hectic
Her grandmother for many a year
Had fed the parish with her bounty
Her second cousin was a peer
And lordlieutenant of the county

But titles and the threepercents
And mortgages and great relations
And India bonds and tithes and rents
Oh what are they to loves sensations
Black eyes fair forehead clustering locks
Such wealth such honors Cupid chooses
He cares as little for the stocks
As Baron Rothschild for the Muses

She sketched the vale the wood the beach
Grew lovelier from her pencils shading
She botanized I envied each
Young blossom in her boudoir fading
She warbled Handel it was grand
She made the Catilina jealous
She touched the organ I could stand
For hours and hours to blow the bellows

She kept an album too at home
Well filled with all an albums glories
Paintings of butterflies and Rome
Patterns for trimmings Persian stories
Soft songs to Julias cockatoo
Fierce odes to famine and to slaughter
And autographs of Prince Leboo
And recipes for elderwater

And she was flattered worshipped bored
Her steps were watched her dress was noted
Her poodledog was quite adored
Her sayings were extremely quoted
She laughed and every heart was glad
As if the taxes were abolished
She frowned and every took was sad
As if the opera were demolished

She smiled on many just for fun
I knew that there was nothing in it
I was the first the only one
Her heart had thought of for a minute
I knew it for she told me so
In phrase which was divinely moulded
She wrote a charming hand and oh
How sweetly all her notes were folded

Our love was like most other loves
A little glow a little shiver
A rosebud and a pair of gloves
And Fly Not Yet upon the river
Some jealousy of some ones heir
Some hopes of dying brokenhearted
A miniature a lock of hair
The usual vowsand then we parted

We parted months and years rolled by
We met again four summers after
Our parting was all sob and sigh
Our meeting was all mirth and laughter
For in my hearts most secret cell
There had been many other lodgers
And she was not the ballrooms belle
But only MrsSomethingRogers

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839




THE FINE OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN

Ill sing you a good old song
Made by a good old pate
Of a fine old English gentleman
Who had an old estate
And who kept up his old mansion
At a bountiful old rate
With a good old porter to relieve
The old poor at his gate
Like a fine old English gentleman
All of the olden time

His hall so old was hung around
With pikes and guns and bows
And swords and good old bucklers
That had stood some tough old blows
Twas there his worship held his state
In doublet and trunk hose
And quaffed his cup of good old sack
To warm his good old nose
Like a fine old English gentleman
All of the olden time

When winters cold brought frost and snow
He opened house to all
And though threescore and ten his years
He featly led the ball
Nor was the houseless wanderer
Eer driven from his hall
For while he feasted all the great
He neer forgot the small
Like a fine old English gentleman
All of the olden time

But time though old is strong in flight
And years rolled swiftly by
And Autumns falling leaves proclaimed
This good old man must die
He laid him down right tranquilly
Gave up lifes latest sigh
And mournful stillness reigned around
And tears bedewed each eye
For this fine old English gentleman
All of the olden time

Now surely this is better far
Than all the new parade
Of theaters and fancy balls
At home and masquerade
And much more economical
For all his bills were paid
Then leave your new vagaries quite
And take up the old trade
Of a fine old English gentleman
All of the olden time

Unknown




A TERNARIE OF LITTLES UPON A PIPKIN OF JELLY SENT TO A LADY

A Little Saint best fits a little Shrine
A little Prop best fits a little Vine
As my small Cruse best fits my little Wine

A little Seed best fits a little Soil
A little Trade best fits a little Toil
As my small Jar best fits my little Oil

A little Bin best fits a little Bread
A little Garland fits a little Head
As my small Stuff best fits my little Shed

A little Hearth best fits a little Fire
A little Chapel fits a little Quire
As my small Bell best fits my little Spire

A little Stream best fits a little Boat
A little Lead best fits a little Float
As my small Pipe best fits my little Note

A little Meat best fits a little Belly
As sweetly lady give me leave to tell ye
This little Pipkin fits this little Jelly

Robert Herrick 15911674




CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT

Fair cousin mine the golden days
Of old romance are over
And minstrels now care naught for bays
Nor damsels for a lover
And hearts are cold and lips are mute
That kindled once with passion
And now weve neither lance nor lute
And tiltings out of fashion

Yet weeping Beauty mourns the time
When Love found words in flowers
When softest test sighs were breathed in rhyme
And sweetest songs in bowers
Now wedlock is a sober thing
No more of chains or forges
A plain young mana plain gold ring
The curateand St Georges

Then every crossbow had a string
And every heart a fetter
And making love was quite the thing
And making verses better
And maidenaunts were never seen
And gallant beaux were plenty
And lasses married at sixteen
And died at oneandtwenty

Then hawking was a noble sport
And chess a pretty science
And huntsmen learned to blow a morte
And heralds a defiance
And knights and spearmen showed their might
And timid hinds took warning
And hypocras was warmed at night
And coursers in the morning

Then plumes and pennons were prepared
And patronsaints were lauded
And noble deeds were bravely dared
And noble dames applauded
And Beauty played the leechs part
And wounds were healed with syrup
And warriors sometimes lost a heart
But never lost a stirrup

Then there was no such thing as Fear
And no such word as Reason
And Faith was like a pointed spear
And Fickleness was treason
And hearts were soft though blows were hard
But when the fight was over
A brimming goblet cheered the board
His Ladys smile the lover

Ay those were golden days The moon
Had then her true adorers
And there were lyres and lutes in tune
And no such thing as snorers
And lovers swam and held at naught
Streams broader than the Mersey
And fifty thousand would have fought
For a smile from Lady Jersey

Then people wore an iron vest
And bad no use for tailors
And the artizans who lived the best
Were armorers and nailers
And steel was measured by the ell
And trousers lined with leather
And jesters wore a cap and bell
And knights a cap and feather

Then single folks might live at ease
And married ones might sever
Uncommon doctors had their fees
But Doctors Commons never
O had we in those times been bred
Fair cousin for thy glances
Instead of breaking Priscians head
I had been breaking lances

Edward Fitzgerald 18091883




THE BALLAD OF BOUILLABAISSE

A street there is in Paris famous
For which no rhyme our language yields
Rue Neuve des Petits Champs its name is
The New Street of the Little Fields
And theres an inn not rich and splendid
But still in comfortable case
The which in youth I oft attended
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse

This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is
A sort of soup or broth or brew
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes
That Greenwich never could outdo
Green herbs red peppers mussels saffern
Soles onions garlic roach and dace
All these you eat at Terres tavern
In that one dish of Bouillabaisse

Indeed a rich and savory stew tis
And true philosophers methinks
Who love all sorts of natural beauties
Should love good victuals and good drinks
And Cordelier or Benedictine
Might gladly sure his lot embrace
Nor find a fastday too afflicting
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse

I wonder if the house still there is
Yes here the lamp is as before
The smiling redcheeked ecaillere is
Still opening oysters at the door
Is Terre still alive and able
I recollect his droll grimace
Hed come and smile before your table
And hope you liked your Bouillabaisse

We enter nothings changed or older
Hows Monsieur Terre waiter pray
The waiter stares and shrugs his shoulder
Monsieur is dead this many a day
It is the lot of saint and sinner
So honest Terres run his race
What will Monsieur require for dinner
Say do you still cook Bouillabaisse

Oh oui Monsieur s the waiters answer
Quel vin Monsieur desiretil
Tell me a good one That I can Sir
The Chambertin with yellow seal
So Terres gone I say and sink in
My old accustomed cornerplace
Hes done with feasting and with drinking
With Burgundy and Bouillabaisse

My old accustomed corner here is
The table still is in the nook
Ah vanished many a busy year is
This wellknown chair since last I took
When first I saw ye cari luoghi
Id scarce a beard upon my face
And now a grizzled grim old fogy
I sit and wait for Bouillabaisse

Where are you old companions trusty
Of early days here met to dine
Come waiter quick a flagon crusty
Ill pledge them in the good old wine
The kind old voices and old faces
My memory can quick retrace
Around the board they take their places
And share the wine and Bouillabaisse

Theres Jack has made a wondrous marriage
Theres laughing Tom is laughing yet
Theres brave Augustus drives his carriage
Theres poor old Fred in the Gazette
On Jamess head the grass is growing
Good Lord the world has wagged apace
Since here we set the Claret flowing
And drank and ate the Bouillabaisse

Ah me how quick the days are flitting
I mind me of a time thats gone
When here Id sit as now Im sitting
In this same placebut not alone
A fair young form was nestled near me
A dear dear face looked fondly up
And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me
Theres no one now to share my cup

I drink it as the Fates ordain it
Come fill it and have done with rhymes
Fill up the lonely glass and drain it
In memory of dear old times
Welcome the wine whateer the seal is
And sit you down and say your grace
With thankful heart whateer the meal is
Here comes the smoking Bouillabaisse

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863




TO MY GRANDMOTHER
Suggested By A Picture By Mr Romney

Under the elm a rustic seat
Was merriest Susans pet retreat
To merrymake

This Relative of mine
Was she seventyandnine
When she died
By the canvas may be seen
How she looked at seventeen
As a Bride

Beneath a summer tree
Her maiden reverie
Has a charm
Her ringlets are in taste
What an arm and what a waist
For an arm

With her bridalwreath bouquet
Lace farthingale and gay
Falbala
If Romneys touch be true
What a lucky dog were you
Grandpapa

Her lips are sweet as love
They are parting Do they move
Are they dumb
Her eyes are blue and beam
Beseechingly and seem
To say Come

What funny fancy slips
From atween these cherry lips
Whisper me
Fair Sorceress in paint
What canon says I maynt
Marry thee

That goodfornothing Time
Has a confidence sublime
When I first
Saw this Lady in my youth
Her winters had forsooth
Done their worst

Her locks as white as snow
Once shamed the swarthy crow
Byandby
That fowls avenging sprite
Set his cruel foot for spite
Near her eye

Her rounded form was lean
And her silk was bombazine
Well I wot
With her needles would she sit
And for hours would she knit
Would she not

Ah perishable clay
Her charms had dropped away
One by one
But if she heaved a sigh
With a burden it was Thy
Will be done

In travail as in tears
With the fardel of her years
Overpressed
In mercy she was borne
Where the weary and the worn
Are at rest

Oh if you now are there
And sweet as once you were
Grandmamma
This nether world agrees
Youll all the better please
Grandpapa

MY MISTRESSS BOOTS

She has dancing eyes and ruby lips
Delightful bootsand away she skips

They nearly strike me dumb
I tremble when they come
Pitapat
This palpitation means
These Boots are Geraldines
Think of that

O where did hunter win
So delicate a skin
For her feet
You lucky little kid
You perished so you did
For my Sweet

The fairy stitching gleams
On the sides and in the seams
And reveals
That the Pixies were the wags
Who tipped these funny tags
And these heels

What soles to charm an elf
Had Crusoe sick of self
Chanced to view
One printed near the tide
O how hard he would have tried
For the two

For Gerrys debonair
And innocent and fair
As a rose
Shes an Angel in a frock
Shes an Angel with a clock
To her hose

The simpletons who squeeze
Their pretty toes to please
Mandarins
Would positively flinch
From venturing to pinch
Geraldines

Cinderellas lefts and rights
To Geraldines were frights
And I trow
The Damsel deftly shod
Has dutifully trod
Until now

Come Gerry since it suits
Such a pretty Puss in Boots
These to don
Set your dainty hand awhile
On my shoulder Dear and Ill
Put them on

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895




A GARDEN LYRIC
Geraldine And I

Dite Damasippe deaeque
Verum ob consilium donent tonsore

We have loitered and laughed in the flowery croft
We have met under wintry skies
Her voice is the dearest voice and soft
Is the light in her wistful eyes
It is bliss in the silent woods among
Gay crowds or in any place
To mould her mind to gaze in her young
Confiding face

For ever may roses divinely blow
And winedark pansies charm
By that prim box path where I felt the glow
Of her dimpled trusting arm
And the sweep of her silk as she turned and smiled
A smile as pure as her pearls
The breeze was in love with the darling Child
And coaxed her curls

She showed me her ferns and woodbine sprays
Foxglove and jasmine stars
A mist of blue in the beds a blaze
Of red in the celadon jars
And velvety bees in convolvulus bells
And roses of bountiful Spring
But I saidThough roses and bees have spells
They have thorn and sting

She showed me ripe peaches behind a net
As fine as her veil and fat
Goldfish agape who lazily met
For her crumbsI grudged them that
A squirrel some rabbits with long lop ears
And guineapigs tortoiseshellwee
And I told her that eloquent truth inheres
In all we see

I lifted her doe by its lops quoth I
Even here deep meaning lies
Why have squirrels these ample tails and why
Have rabbits these prominent eyes
She smiled and said as she twirled her veil
For some nice little cause no doubt
If you lift a guineapig up by the tail
His eyes drop out

Frederick Locker Lampson 18211895




MRS SMITH

Heighho theyre wed The cards are dealt
Our frolic games are oer
Ive laughed and fooled and loved Ive felt
As I shall feel no more
Yon little thatch is where she lives
Yon spire is where she met me
I think that if she quite forgives
She cannot quite forget me

Last year I trod these fields with Di
Fields fresh with clover and with rye
They now seem arid
Then Di was fair and single how
Unfair it seems on me for now
Dis fairand married

A blissful swainI scorned the song
Which tells us though young Love is strong
The Fates are stronger
Then breezes blew a boon to men
Then buttercups were bright and then
The grass was longer

That day I saw and much esteemed
Dis ankles that the clover seemed
Inclined to smother
It twitched and soon untied for fun
The ribbons of her shoes first one
And then the other

Im told that virgins augur some
Misfortune if their shoestrings come
To grief on Friday
And so did Diand then her pride
Decreed that shoestrings so untied
Are so untidy

Of course I knelt with fingers deft
I tied the right and tied the left
Says Di This stubble
Is very stupidas I live
Im quite ashamedIm shocked to give
You so much trouble

For answer I was fain to sink
To what we all would say and think
Were Beauty present
Dont mention such a simple act
A trouble not the least In fact
Its rather pleasant

I trust that Love will never tease
Poor little Di or prove that hes
A graceless rover
Shes happy now as Mrs Smith
But less polite when walking with
Her chosen lover

Heighho Although no moral clings
To Dis blue eyes and sandal strings
We had our quarrels
I think that Smith is thought an ass
I know that when they walk in grass
She wears balmorals

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895




THE SKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD

The characters of great and small
Come ready made we cant bespeak one
Their sides are many too and all
Except ourselves have got a weak one
Some sanguine people love for life
Some love their hobby till it flings them
How many love a pretty wife
For love of the eclat she brings them

A little to relieve my mind
Ive thrown off this disjointed chatter
But more because Im disinclined
To enter on a painful matter
Once I was bashful Ill allow
Ive blushed for words untimely spoken
I still am rather shy and now
And now the ice is fairly broken

We all have secrets you have one
Which may nt be quite your charming spouses
We all lock up a Skeleton
In some grim chamber of our houses
Familiars who exhaust their days
And nights in probing where our smart is
And who for all their spiteful ways
Are silent unassuming Parties

We hug this Phantom we detest
Rarely we let it cross our portals
It is a most exacting guest
And we are much afflicted mortals
Your neighbor Gay that jovial wight
As Dives rich and brave as Hector
Poor Gay steals twenty times a night
On shaking knees to see his Specter

Old Dives fears a pauper fate
So hoarding is his ruling passion
Some gloomy souls anticipate
A waistcoat straiter than the fashion
She childless pines that lonely wife
And secret tears are bitter shedding
Hector may tremble all his life
And diebut not of that hes dreading

Ah me the World How fast it spins
The beldams dance the caldron bubbles
They shriek they stir it for our sins
And we must drain it for our troubles
We toil we groan the cry for love
Mounts up from this poor seething city
And yet I know we have above
A Father infinite in pity

When Beauty smiles when Sorrow weeps
Where sunbeams play where shadows darken
One inmate of our dwelling keeps
Its ghastly carnival but hearken
How dry the rattle of the bones
That sound was not to make you start meant
Stand by Your humble servant owns
The Tenant of this Dark Apartment

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895




A TERRIBLE INFANT

I recollect a nurse called Ann
Who carried me about the grass
And one fine day a fine young man
Came up and kissed the pretty lass
She did not make the least objection
Thinks I Aha
When I can talk Ill tell Mamma
And thats my earliest recollection

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895




COMPANIONS
A Tale Of A Grandfather

I know not of what we pondered
Or made pretty pretence to talk
As her hand within mine we wandered
Toward the pool by the limetree walk
While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers
And the blushrose bent on her stalk

I cannot recall her figure
Was it regal as Junos own
Or only a trifle bigger
Than the elves who surround the throne
Of the Fairy Queen and are seen I ween
By mortals in dreams alone

What her eyes were like I know not
Perhaps they were blurred with tears
And perhaps in yon skies there glow not
On the contrary clearer spheres
No as to her eyes I am just as wise
As you or the cat my dears

Her teeth I presume were pearly
But which was she brunette or blonde
Her hair was it quaintly curly
Or as straight as a beadles wand
That I failed to remark it was rather dark
And shadowy round the pond

Then the hand that reposed so snugly
In minewas it plump or spare
Was the countenance fair or ugly
Nay children you have me there
My eyes were phaps blurred and besides Id heard
That its horribly rude to stare

And Iwas I brusque and surly
Or oppressively bland and fond
Was I partial to rising early
Or why did we twain abscond
When nobody knew from the public view
To prowl by a misty pond

What passed what was felt or spoken
Whether anything passed at all
And whether the heart was broken
That beat under that sheltering shawl
If shawl she had on which I doubthas gone
Yes gone from me past recall

Was I haply the ladys suitor
Or her uncle I cant make out
Ask your governess dears or tutor
For myself Im in hopeless doubt
As to why we were there who on earth we were
And what this is all about

Charles Stuart Calverley 18311884




DOROTHY Q
A Family Portrait

Grandmothers mother her age I guess
Thirteen summers or something less
Girlish bust but womanly air
Smooth square forehead with uprolled hair
Lips that lover has never kissed
Taper fingers and slender wrist
Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade
So they painted the little maid

On her hand a parrot green
Sits unmoving and broods serene
Hold up the canvas full in view
Look theres a rent the light shines through
Dark with a centurys fringe of dust
That was a RedCoats rapierthrust
Such is the tale the lady old
Dorothys daughters daughter told

Who the painter was none may tell
One whose best was not over well
Hard and dry it must be confessed
Flat as a rose that has long been pressed
Yet in her cheek the hues are bright
Dainty colors of red and white
And in her slender shape are seen
Hint and promise of stately mien

Look not on her with eyes of scorn
Dorothy Q was a lady born
Ay since the galloping Normans came
Englands annals have known her name
And still to the threehilled rebel town
Dear is that ancient names renown
For many a civic wreath they won
The youthful sire and the grayhaired son

O Damsel Dorothy Dorothy Q
Strange is the gift that I owe to you
Such a gift as never a king
Save to daughter or son might bring
All my tenure of heart and hand
All my title to house and land
Mother and sister and child and wife
And joy and sorrow and death and life

What if a hundred years ago
Those closeshut lips had answered No
When forth the tremulous question came
That cost the maiden her Norman name
And under the folds that look so still
The bodice swelled with the bosoms thrill
Should I be I or would it be
One tenth another to nine tenths me

Soft is the breath of a maidens YES
Not the light gossamer stirs with less
But never a cable that holds so fast
Through all the battles of wave and blast
And never an echo of speech or song
That lives in the babbling air so long
There were tones in the voice that whispered then
You may hear today in a hundred men

O lady and lover how faint and far
Your images hoverand here we are
Solid and stirring in flesh and bone
Edwards and Dorothysall their own
A goodly record for Time to show
Of a syllable spoken so long ago
Shall I bless you Dorothy or forgive
For the tender whisper that bade me live

It shall be a blessing my little maid
I will heal the stab of the RedCoats blade
And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame
And gild with a rhyme your household name
So you shall smile on us brave and bright
As first you greeted the mornings light
And live untroubled by woes and fears
Through a second youth of a hundred years

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




MY AUNT

My aunt my dear unmarried aunt
Long years have oer her flown
Yet still she strains the aching clasp
That binds her virgin zone
I know it hurts herthough she looks
As cheerful as she can
Her waist is ampler than her life
For life is but a span

My aunt my poor deluded aunt
Her hair is almost gray
Why will she train that winter curl
In such a springlike way
How can she lay her glasses down
And say she reads as well
When through a double convex lens
She just makes out to spell

Her fathergrandpapa forgive
This erring lip its smiles
Vowed she should make the finest girl
Within a hundred miles
He sent her to a stylish school
Twas in her thirteenth June
And with her as the rules required
Two towels and a spoon

They braced my aunt against a board
To make her straight and tall
They laced her up they starved her down
To make her light and small
They pinched her feet they singed her hair
They screwed it up with pins
Oh never mortal suffered more
In penance for her sins

So when my precious aunt was done
My grandsire brought her back
By daylight lest some rabid youth
Might follow on the track
Ah said my grandsire as he shook
Some powder in his pan
What could this lovely creature do
Against a desperate man

Alas nor chariot nor barouche
Nor bandit cavalcade
Tore from the trembling fathers arms
His allaccomplished maid
For her how happy had it been
And Heaven had spared to me
To see one sad ungathered rose
On my ancestral tree

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




THE LAST LEAF

I saw him once before
As he passed by the door
And again
The pavement stones resound
As he totters oer the ground
With his cane

They say that in his prime
Ere the pruningknife of Time
Cut him down
Not a better man was found
By the Crier on his round
Through the town

But now he walks the streets
And he looks at all he meets
Sad and wan
And he shakes his feeble head
That it seems as if he said
They are gone

The mossy marbles rest
On the lips that he has pressed
In their bloom
And the names he loved to hear
Have been carved for many a year
On the tomb

My grandmamma has said
Poor old lady she is dead
Long ago
That he had a Roman nose
And his cheek was like a rose
In the snow

But now his nose is thin
And it rests upon his chin
Like a staff
And a crook is in his back
And a melancholy crack
In his laugh

I know it is a sin
For me to sit and grin
At him here
But the old threecornered hat
And the breeches and all that
Are so queer

And if I should live to be
The last leaf upon the tree
In the spring
Let them smile as I do now
At the old forsaken bough
Where I cling

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




CONTENTMENT
Man wants but little here below

Little I ask my wants are few
I only wish a hut of stone
A very plain brown stone will do
That I may call my own
And close at hand is such a one
In yonder street that fronts the sun

Plain food is quite enough for me
Three courses are as good as ten
If Nature can subsist on three
Thank Heaven for three Amen
I always thought cold victual nice
My choice would be vanillaice

I care not much for gold or land
Give me a mortgage here and there
Some good bankstock some note of hand
Or trifling railroad share
I only ask that Fortune send
A little more than I shall spend

Honors are silly toys I know
And titles are but empty names
I would perhaps be Plenipo
But only near St James
Im very sure I should not care
To fill our Gubernators chair

Jewels are baubles tis a sin
To care for such unfruitful things
One goodsized diamond in a pin
Some not so large in rings
A ruby and a pearl or so
Will do for meI laugh at show

My dame should dress in cheap attire
Good heavy silks are never dear
I own perhaps I might desire
Some shawls of true Cashmere
Some marrowy crapes of China silk
Like wrinkled skins on scalded milk

I would not have the horse I drive
So fast that folks must stop and stare
An easy gaittwo fortyfive
Suits me I do not care
Perhaps far just a single spurt
Some seconds less would do no hurt

Of pictures I should like to own
Titians and Raphaels three or four
I love so much their style and tone
One Turner and no more
A landscapeforeground golden dirt
The sunshine painted with a squirt

Of books but fewsome fifty score
For daily use and bound for wear
The rest upon an upper floor
Some little luxury there
Of red moroccos gilded gleam
And vellum rich as country cream

Busts cameos gemssuch things as these
Which others often show for pride
I value for their power to please
And selfish churls deride
One Stradivarius I confess
Two meerschaums I would fain possess

Wealths wasteful tricks I will not learn
Nor ape the glittering upstart fool
Shall not carved tables serve my turn
But all must be of buhl
Give grasping pomp its double share
I ask but one recumbent chair

Thus humble let me live and die
Nor long for Midas golden touch
If Heaven more generous gifts deny
I shall not miss them much
Too grateful for the blessing lent
Of simple tastes and mind content

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




THE BOYS

Has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys
If there has take him out without making a noise
Hang the Almanacs cheat and the Catalogues spite
Old Time is a liar Were twenty tonight

Were twenty Were twenty Who says we are more
Hes tipsyyoung jackanapesshow him the door
Gray temples at twentyYes white if we please
Where the snowflakes fall thickest theres nothing can freeze

Was it snowing I spoke of Excuse the mistake
Look closeyou will not see a sign of a flake
We want some new garlands for those we have shed
And these are white roses in place of the red

Weve a trick we young fellows you may have been told
Of talking in public as if we were old
That boy we call Doctor and this we call Judge
Its a neat little fictionof course its all fudge

That fellows the Speakerthe one on the right
Mr Mayor my young one how are you tonight
Thats our Member of Congress we say when we chaff
Theres the Reverend Whats his namedont make me laugh

That boy with the grave mathematical look
Made believe he had written a wonderful book
And the ROYAL SOCIETY thought it was true
So they chose him right in a good joke it was too

Theres a boy we pretend with a threedecker brain
That could harness a team with a logical chain
When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire
We called him The Justice but now hes The Squire

And theres a nice youngster of excellent pith
Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith
But he shouted a song for the brave and the free
Just read on his medal My country of thee

You hear that boy laughingYou think hes all fun
But the angels laugh too at the good he has done
The children laugh loud as they troop to his call
And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all

Yes were boysalways playing with tongue or with pen
And I sometimes have askedShall we ever be men
Shall we always be youthful and laughing and gay
Till the last dear companion drops smiling away

Then heres to our boyhood its gold and its gray
The stars of its winter the dews of its May
And when we have done with our lifelasting toys
Dear Father take care of thy children The Boys

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE

Twas a jolly old pedagogue long ago
Tall and slender and sallow and dry
His form was bent and his gait was slow
His long thin hair was as white as snow
But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye
And he sang every night as he went to bed
Let us be happy down here below
The living should live though the dead be dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

He taught his scholars the rule of three
Writing and reading and history too
He took the little ones up on his knee
For a kind old heart in his breast had he
And the wants of the littlest child he knew
Learn while youre young he often said
There is much to enjoy down here below
Life for the living and rest for the dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

With the stupidest boys he was kind and cool
Speaking only in gentlest tones
The rod was hardly known in his school
Whipping to him was a barbarous rule
And too hard work for his poor old bones
Besides it was painful he sometimes said
We should make life pleasant down here below
The living need charity more than the dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

He lived in the house by the hawthorn lane
With roses and woodbine over the door
His rooms were quiet and neat and plain
But a spirit of comfort there held reign
And made him forget he was old and poor
I need so little he often said
And my friends and relatives here below
Wont litigate over me when I am dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

But the pleasantest times that he had of all
Were the sociable hours he used to pass
With his chair tipped back to a neighbors wall
Making an unceremonious call
Over a pipe and a friendly glass
This was the finest picture he said
Of the many he tasted here below
Who has no cronies had better be dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

Then the jolly old pedagogues wrinkled face
Melted all over in sunshiny smiles
He stirred his glass with an oldschool grace
Chuckled and sipped and prattled apace
Till the house grew merry from cellar to tiles
Im a pretty old man he gently said
Ive lingered a long while here below
But my heart is fresh if my youth is fled
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

He smoked his pipe in the balmy air
Every night when the sun went down
While the soft wind played in his silvery hair
Leaving its tenderest kisses there
On the jolly old pedagogues jolly old crown
And feeling the kisses he smiled and said
Twas a glorious world down here below
Why wait for happiness till we are dead
Said the jolly old pedagogue long ago

He sat at his door one midsummer night
After the sun had sunk in the west
And the lingering beams of golden light
Made his kindly old face look warm and bright
While the odorous nightwind whispered Rest
Gently gently he bowed his head
There were angels waiting for him I know
He was sure of happiness living or dead
This jolly old pedagogue long ago

George Arnold 18341865




ON AN INTAGLIO HEAD OF MINERVA

Beneath the warriors helm behold
The flowing tresses of the woman
Minerva Pallas what you will
A winsome creature Greek or Roman

Minerva No tis some sly minx
In cousins helmet masquerading
If notthen Wisdom was a dame
For sonnets and for serenading

I thought the goddess cold austere
Not made for loves despairs and blisses
Did Pallas wear her hair like that
Was Wisdoms mouth so shaped for kisses

The Nightingale should be her bird
And not the Owl bigeyed and solemn
How very fresh she looks and yet
Shes older far than Trajans Column

The magic hand that carved this face
And set this vinework round it running
Perhaps ere mighty Phidias wrought
Had lost its subtle skill and cunning

Who was he Was he glad or sad
Who knew to carve in such a fashion
Perchance he graved the dainty head
For some brown girl that scorned his passion

Perchance in some still gardenplace
Where neither fount nor tree today is
He flung the jewel at the feet
Of Phryne or perhaps twas Lais

But he is dust we may not know
His happy or unhappy story
Nameless and dead these centuries
His work outlives himtheres his glory

Both man and jewel lay in earth
Beneath a lavaburied city
The countless summers came and went
With neither haste nor hate nor pity

Years blotted out the man but left
The jewel fresh as any blossom
Till some Visconti dug it up
To rise and fall on Mabels bosom

O nameless brother see how Time
Your gracious handiwork has guarded
See how your loving patient art
Has come at last to be rewarded

Who would not suffer slights of men
And pangs of hopeless passion also
To have his carven agatestone
On such a bosom rise and fall so

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907




THALIA
A Middleaged Lyrical Poet Is supposed To Be Taking
Final Leave Of The Muse Of Comedy She Has Brought
Him His Hat And Gloves And Is Abstractedly Picking
A Thread Of Gold Hair From His Coat Sleeve As He
Begins To Speak

I say it under the rose
 oh thanksyes under the laurel
We part lovers not foes
 we are not going to quarrel

We have too long been friends
 on foot and in gilded coaches
Now that the whole thing ends
 to spoil our kiss with reproaches

I leave you my soul is wrung
 I pause look back from the portal
Ah I no more am young
 and you child you are immortal

Mine is the glaciers way
 yours is the blossoms weather
When were December and May
 known to be happy together

Before my kisses grow tame
 before my moodiness grieve you
While yet my heart is flame
 and I all lover I leave you

So in the coming time
 when you count the rich years over
Think of me in my prime
 and not as a whitehaired lover

Fretful pierced with regret
 the wraith of a dead Desire
Thrumming a cracked spinet
 by a slowly dying fire

When at last I am cold
 years hence if the gods so will it
Say He was true as gold
 and wear a rose in your fillet

Others tender as I
 will come and sue for caresses
Woo you win you and die
 mind you a rose in your tresses

Some Melpomene woo
 some hold Clio the nearest
You sweet Comedyyou
 were ever sweetest and dearest

Nay it is time to go
 When writing your tragic sister
Say to that child of woe
 how sorry I was I missed her

Really I cannot stay
 though parting is such sweet sorrow
Perhaps I will on my way
 downtown look in tomorrow

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907




PAN IN WALL STREET
A D 1867

Just where the Treasurys marble front
Looks over Wall Streets mingled nations
Where Jews and Gentiles most are wont
To throng for trade and last quotations
Where hour by hour the rates of gold
Outrival in the ears of people
The quarterchimes serenely tolled
From Trinitys undaunted steeple

Even there I heard a strange wild strain
Sound high above the modern clamor
Above the cries of greed and gain
The curbstone war the auctions hammer
And swift on Musics misty ways
It led from all this strife for millions
To ancient sweettonothing days
Among the kirtlerobed Sicilians

And as it stilled the multitude
And yet more joyous rose and shriller
I saw the minstrel where he stood
At ease against a Doric pillar
One hand a droning organ played
The other held a Panspipe fashioned
Like those of old to lips that made
The reeds give out that strain impassioned

Twas Pan himself had wandered here
Astrolling through this sordid city
And piping to the civic ear
The prelude of some pastoral ditty
The demigod had crossed the seas
From haunts of shepherd nymph and satyr
And Syracusan timesto these
Far shores and twenty centuries later

A ragged cap was on his head
Buthidden thusthere was no doubting
That all with crispy locks oerspread
His gnarled horns were somewhere sprouting
His clubfeet cased in rusty shoes
Were crossed as on some frieze you see them
And trousers patched of divers hues
Concealed his crooked shanks beneath them

He filled the quivering reeds with sound
And oer his mouth their changes shifted
And with his goatseyes looked around
Whereer the passing current drifted
And soon as on Trinacrian hills
The nymphs and herdsmen ran to hear him
Even now the tradesmen from their tills
With clerks and porters crowded near him

The bulls and bears together drew
From Jauncey Court and New Street Alley
As erst if pastorals be true
Came beasts from every wooded valley
The random passers stayed to list
A boxer Aegon rough and merry
A Broadway Daphnis on his tryst
With Nais at the Brooklyn Ferry

A oneeyed Cyclops halted long
In tattered cloak of army pattern
And Galatea joined the throng
A blowsy applevending slattern
While old Silenus staggered out
From some newfangled lunchhouse handy
And bade the piper with a shout
To strike up Yankee Doodle Dandy

A newsboy and a peanutgirl
Like little Fauns began to caper
His hair was all in tangled curl
Her tawny legs were bare and taper
And still the gathering larger grew
And gave its pence and crowded nigher
While aye the shepherdminstrel blew
His pipe and struck the gamut higher

O heart of Nature beating still
With throbs her vernal passion taught her
Even here as on the vineclad hill
Or by the Arethusan water
New forms may fold the speech new lands
Arise within these oceanportals
But Music waves eternal wands
Enchantress of the souls of mortals

So thought Ibut among us trod
A man in blue with legal baton
And scoffed the vagrant demigod
And pushed him from the step I sat on
Doubting I mused upon the cry
Great Pan is deadand all the people
Went on their waysand clear and high
The quarter sounded from the steeple

Edmund Clarence Stedman 18331908




UPON LESBIAARGUING

My Lesbia I will not deny
Bewitches me completely
She has the usual beaming eye
And smiles upon me sweetly
But she has an unseemly way
Of contradicting what I say

And though I am her closest friend
And find her fascinating
I cannot cordially commend
Her method of debating
Her logic though she is divine
Is singularly feminine

Her reasoning is full of tricks
And butterfly suggestions
I know no point to which she sticks
She begs the simplest questions
And when her premises are strong
She always draws her inference wrong

Broad liberal views on men and things
She will not hear a word of
To prove herself correct she brings
Some instance she has heard of
The argument ad hominem
Appears her favorite strategem

Old Socrates with sage replies
To questions put to suit him
Would not I think have looked so wise
With Lesbia to confute him
He would more probably have bade
Xantippe hasten to his aid

Ah well my fair philosopher
With clear brown eyes that glisten
So sweetly that I much prefer
To look at them than listen
Preach me your sermon have your way
The voice is yours whateer you say

Alfred Cochrane 1865




TO ANTHEA WHO MAY COMMAND HIM ANYTHING
New Style

Am I sincere I say I dote
On everything that Browning wrote
I know some bits by heart to quote
But then She reads him
I sayand is it strictly true
How I admire her cockatoo
Well in a way of course I do
But then She feeds him

And I become at her command
The sternest Tory in the land
The Grand Old Man is far from grand
But then She states it
Nay worse than that I am so tame
I once admittedto my shame
That football was a brutal game
Because She hates it

My taste in Art she hailed with groans
And I once charmed with bolder tones
Now love the yellows of BurneJones
But then She likes them
My tuneful soul no longer hoards
Stray jewels from the Empire boards
I revel now in Dvoraks chords
But then She strikes them

Our age distinctly cramps a knight
Yet though debarred from tilt and fight
I can admit that black is white
If She asserts it
Heroes of old were luckier men
Than II venture now and then
To hintretracting meekly when
She controverts it

Alfred Cochrane 1865




THE EIGHTDAY CLOCK

The days of Bute and Graftons fame
Of Chathams waning prime
First heard your sounding gong proclaim
Its chronicle of Time
Old days when Dodd confessed his guilt
When Goldsmith drave his quill
And genial gossip Horace built
His house on Strawberry Hill

Now with a grave unmeaning face
You still repeat the tale
Hightowering in your somber case
Designed by Chippendale
Without regret for what is gone
You bid old customs change
As year by year you travel on
To scenes and voices strange

We might have mingled with the crowd
Of courtiers in this hall
The fans that swayed the wigs that bowed
But you have spoiled it all
We might have lingered in the train
Of nymphs that Reynolds drew
Or stared spellbound in Drury Lane
At Garrickbut for you

We might in Leicester Fields have swelled
The throng of beaux and cits
Or listened to the concourse held
Among the Kitcat wits
Have strolled with Selwyn in Pall Mall
Arrayed in gorgeous silks
Or in Great George Street raised a yell
For Liberty and Wilkes

This is the life which you have known
Which you have ticked away
In one unmoved unfaltering tone
That ceased not day by day
While ever round your dial moved
Your hands from span to span
Through drowsy hours and hours that proved
Big with the fate of man

A steady tick for fatal creeds
For youth on folly bent
A steady tick for worthy deeds
And moments wisely spent
No warning note of emphasis
No whisper of advice
To ruined rake or flippant miss
For coquetry or dice

You might I think have hammered out
With meaning doubly dear
The midnight of a Vauxhall rout
In Evelinas ear
Or when the night was almost gone
You might the deals between
Have startled those who looked upon
The cloth when it was green

But no in all the vanished years
Down which your wheels have run
Your message borne to heedless ears
Is one and only one
No wit of men no power of kings
Can stem the overthrow
Wrought by this pendulum that swings
Sedately to and fro

Alfred Cochrane 1865




A PORTRAIT

In sunny girlhoods vernal life
She caused no small sensation
But now the modest English wife
To others leaves flirtation
Shes young still lovely debonair
Although sometimes her features
Are clouded by a thought of care
For those two tiny creatures

Each tiny toddling mottled mite
Asserts with voice emphatic
In lisping accents Mite is right
Their rule is autocratic
The song becomes that charmed mankind
Their musical narcotic
And baby lips than Love shell find
Are even more despotic

Soft lullaby when singing there
And castles ever building
Their destiny shell carve in air
Bright with maternal gilding
Young Guy a clever advocate
So eloquent and able
A powdered wig upon his pate
A coronet for Mabel

Joseph AshbySterry 18381917




OLD BOOKS ARE BEST

Old Books are best With what delight
Does Faithorne fecit greet our sight
On frontispiece or titlepage
Of that old time when on the stage
Sweet Nell set Rowleys heart alight

And you O Friend to whom I write
Must not deny een though you might
Through fear of modern pirates rage
Old Books are best

What though the print be not so bright
The paper dark the binding slight
Our author be he dull or sage
Returning from that distant age
So lives again we say of right
Old Books are best

Beverly Chew 18501924




IMPRESSION

In these restrained and careful times
Our knowledge petrifies our rhymes
Ah for that reckless fire men had
When it was witty to be mad

When wild conceits were piled in scores
And lit by flaming metaphors
When all was crazed and out of tune
Yet throbbed with music of the moon

If we could dare to write as ill
As some whose voices haunt us still
Even we perchance might call our own
Their deep enchanting undertone

We are too diffident and nice
Too learned and too overwise
Too much afraid of faults to be
The flutes of bold sincerity

For as this sweet life passes by
We blink and nod with critic eye
Weve no words rude enough to give
Its charm so frank and fugitive

The green and scarlet of the Park
The undulating streets at dark
The brown smoke blown across the blue
This colored city we walk through

The pallid faces full of pain
The fieldsmell of the passing wain
The laughter longing perfume strife
The daily spectacle of life

Ah how shall this be given to rhyme
By rhymesters of a knowing time
Ah for the age when verse was clad
Being godlike to be bad and mad

Edmund Gosse 18491928




WITH STRAWBERRIES

With strawberries we filled a tray
And then we drove away away
Along the links beside the sea
Where wave and wind were light and free
And August felt as fresh as May

And where the springy turf was gay
With thyme and balm and many a spray
Of wild roses you tempted me
With strawberries

A shadowy sail silent and gray
Stole like a ghost across the bay
But none could hear me ask my fee
And none could know what came to be
Can sweethearts all their thirst allay
With strawberries

William Ernest Henley 18491903




BALLADE OF LADIES NAMES

Browns for Lalage Jones for Lelia
Robinsons bosom for Beatrice glows
Smith is a Hamlet before Ophelia
The glamor stays if the reason goes
Every lover the years disclose
Is of a beautiful name made free
One befriends and all others are foes
Annas the name of names for me

Sentiment hallows the vowels of Delia
Sweet simplicity breathes from Rose
Courtly memories glitter in Celia
Rosalind savors of quips and hose
Araminta of wits and beaux
Prue of puddings and Coralie
All of sawdust and spangled shows
Annas the name of names for me

Fie upon Caroline Madge Amelia
These I reckon the essence of prose
Cavalier Katherine cold Cornelia
Portias masterful Roman nose
Mauds magnificence Tottys toes
Poll and Bet with their twang of the sea
Nells impertinence Pamelas woes
Annas the name of names for me

ENVOY
Ruth like a gillyflower smells and blows
Sylvia prattles of Arcadee
Sybil mystifies Connie crows
Annas the name of names for me

William Ernest Henley 18491903




TO A PAIR OF EGYPTIAN SLIPPERS

Tiny slippers of gold and green
Tied with a mouldering golden cord
What pretty feet they must have been
When Caesar Augustus was Egypts lord
Somebody graceful and fair you were
Not many girls could dance in these
When did your shoemaker make you dear
Such a nice pair of Egyptian threes

Where were you measured In Sais or On
Memphis or Thebes or Pelusium
Fitting them neatly your brown toes upon
Lacing them deftly with finger and thumb
I seem to see youso long ago
Twentyone centuries less or more
And here are your sandals yet none of us know
What name or fortune or face you bore

Your lips would have laughed with a rosy scorn
If the merchant or slavegirl had mockingly said
The feet will pass but the shoes they have worn
Two thousand years onward Times road shall tread
And still be footgear as good as new
To think that calfskin gilded and stitched
Should Rome and the Pharaohs outliveand you
Be gone like a dream from the world you bewitched

Not that we mourn you Twere too absurd
You have been such a very long while away
Your dry spiced dust would not value one word
Of the soft regrets that my verse could say
Sorrow and Pleasure and Love and Hate
If you ever felt them have vaporized hence
To this odorso subtle and delicate
Of myrrh and cassia and frankincense

Of course they embalmed you Yet not so sweet
Were aloes and nard as the youthful glow
Which Amenti stole when the small dark feet
Wearied of treading our world below
Look it was floodtime in valley of Nile
Or a very wet day in the Delta dear
When your slippers tripped lightly their latest mile
The mud on the soles renders that fact clear

You knew Cleopatra no doubt You saw
Antonys galleys from Actium come
But there if questions could answers draw
From lips so many a long age dumb
I would not tease you with history
Nor vex your heart for the men that were
The one point to learn that would fascinate me
Is where and what are you today my dear

You died believing in Horus and Pasht
Isis Osiris and priestly lore
And found of course such theories smashed
By actual fact on the heavenly shore
What next did you do Did you transmigrate
Have we seen you since all modern and fresh
Your charming soulso I calculate
Mislaid its mummy and sought new flesh

Were you she whom I met at dinner last week
With eyes and hair of the Ptolemy black
Who still of this find in Fayoum would speak
And to Pharaohs and scarabs still carry us back
A scent of lotus about her hung
And she had such a faraway wistful air
As of somebody born when the Earth was young
And she wore of gilt slippers a lovely pair

Perchance you were married These might have been
Part of your trousseauthe wedding shoes
And you laid them aside with the garments green
And painted clay Gods which a bride would use
And may be today by Niles bright waters
Damsels of Egypt in gowns of blue
Greatgreatgreatvery greatgranddaughters
Owe their shapely insteps to you

But vainly I beat at the bars of the Past
Little green slippers with golden strings
For all you can tell is that leather will last
When loves and delightings and beautiful things
Have vanished forgottenNo not quite that
I catch some gleam of the grace you wore
When you finished with Lifes daily pitapat
And left your shoes at Deaths bedroom door

You were born in the Egypt which did not doubt
You were never sad with our newfashioned sorrows
You were sure when your playdays on Earth ran out
Of playtimes to come as we of our morrows
Oh wise little Maid of the Delta I lay
Your shoes in your mummychest back again
And wish that one game we might merrily play
At Hunt the Slippersto see it all plain

Edwin Arnold 18321904




WITHOUT AND WITHIN

My coachman in the moonlight there
Looks through the sidelight of the door
I hear him with his brethren swear
As I could dobut only more

Flattening his nose against the pane
He envies me my brilliant lot
Breathes on his aching fists in vain
And dooms me to a place more hot

He sees me in to supper go
A silken wonder by my side
Bare arms bare shoulders and a row
Of flounces for the door too wide

He thinks how happy is my arm
Neath its whitegloved and jewelled load
And wishes me some dreadful harm
Hearing the merry corks explode

Meanwhile I inly curse the bore
Of hunting still the same old coon
And envy him outside the door
In golden quiets of the moon

The winter wind is not so cold
As the bright smile he sees me win
Nor the hosts oldest wine so old
As our poor gabble sour and thin

I envy him the ungyved prance
With which his freezing feet he warms
And drag my ladyschains and dance
The galleyslave of dreary forms

Oh could he have my share of din
And I his quietpast a doubt
Twould still be one man bored within
And just another bored without

Nay when once paid my mortal fee
Some idler on my headstone grim
Traces the mossblurred name will he
Think me the happier or I him

James Russell Lowell 18191891




SHE WAS A BEAUTY

She was a beauty in the days
When Madison was President
And quite coquettish in her ways
On conquests of the heart intent

Grandpapa on his right knee bent
Wooed her in stiff oldfashioned phrase
She was a beauty in the days
When Madison was President

And when your roses where hers went
Shall go my Rose who date from Hayes
I hope youll wear her sweet content
Of whom tradition lightly says
She was a beauty in the days
When Madison was President

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896




NELL GWYNNES LOOKINGGLASS

Glass antique twixt thee and Nell
Draw we here a parallel
She like thee was forced to bear
All reflections foul or fair
Thou art deep and bright within
Depths as bright belonged to Gwynne
Thou art very frail as well
Frail as flesh isso was Nell

Thou her glass art silverlined
She too had a silver mind
Thine is fresh till this far day
Hers till death neer wore away
Thou dost to thy surface win
Wandering glances so did Gwynne
Eyes on thee love long to dwell
So mens eyes would do on Nell

Lifelike forms in thee are sought
Such the forms the actress wrought
Truth unfailing rests in you
Nell whateer she was was true
Clear as virtue dull as sin
Thou art oft as oft was Gwynne
Breathe on thee and drops will swell
Bright tears dimmed the eyes of Nell

Thines a frame to charm the sight
Framed was she to give delight
Waxen forms here truly show
Charles above and Nell below
But between them chin with chin
Stuart stands as low as Gwynne
Paired yet partedmeant to tell
Charles was opposite to Nell

Round the glass wherein her face
Smiled so soft her arms we trace
Thou her mirror hast the pair
Lion here and leopard there
She had part in theseakin
To the lionheart was Gwynne
And the leopards beauty fell
With its spots to bounding Nell

Oft inspected neer seen through
Thou art firm if brittle too
So her will on good intent
Might be broken never bent
What the glass was when therein
Beamed the face of glad Nell Gwynne
Was that face by beautys spell
To the honest soul of Nell

Laman Blanchard 18041845




MIMNERMUS IN CHURCH

You promise heavens free from strife
Pure truth and perfect change of will
But sweet sweet is this human life
So sweet I fain would breathe it still
Your chilly stars I can forego
This warm kind world is all I know

You say there is no substance here
One great reality above
Back from that void I shrink in fear
And childlike hide myself in love
Show me what angels feel Till then
I cling a mere weak man to men

You bid me lift my mean desires
From faltering lips and fitful veins
To sexless souls ideal choirs
Unwearied voices wordless strains
My mind with fonder welcome owns
One dear dead friends remembered tones

Forsooth the present we must give
To that which cannot pass away
All beauteous things for which we live
By laws of time and space decay
But oh the very reason why
I clasp them is because they die

William JohnsonCory 18231892




CLAY

We are but clay the preacher saith
The heart is clay and clay the brain
And soon or late there cometh death
To mingle us with earth again

Well let the preacher have it so
And clay we are and clay shall be
Why iteratefor this I know
That clay does very well for me

When clay has such red mouths to kiss
Firm hands to grasp it is enough
How can I take it aught amiss
We are not made of rarer stuff

And if one tempt you to believe
His choice would be immortal gold
Question him Can you then conceive
A warmer heart than clay can hold

Or richer joys than clay can feel
And when perforce he falters nay
Bid him renounce his wish and kneel
In thanks for this same kindly clay

Edward Verrall Lucas 1868




AUCASSIN AND NICOLETE

What magic halo rings thy head
Dreammaiden of a minstrel dead
What charm of faerie round thee hovers
That all who listen are thy lovers

What power yet makes our pulses thrill
To see thee at thy windowsill
And by that dangerous cord downsliding
And through the moonlit garden gliding

True maiden art thou in thy dread
True maiden in thy hardihead
True maiden when thy fears halfover
Thou lingerest to try thy lover

And ah what heart of stone or steel
But doth some stir unwonted feel
When to the day new brightness bringing
Thou standest at the stairfoot singing

Thy slender limbs in boyish dress
Thy tones half glee half tenderness
Thou singest neath the light tales cover
Of thy true love to thy true lover

O happy lover happy maid
Together in sweet story laid
Forgive the hand that here is baring
Your old loves for new lovers staring

Yet Nicolete why fearst thou fame
No slander now can touch thy name
Nor Scandals self a fault discovers
Though each new year thou hast new lovers

Nor Aucassin needst thou to fear
These lovers of too late a year
Nor dread one jealous pangs revival
No lover now can be thy rival

What flower considers if its blooms
Light haunts of men or forest glooms
What care ye though the world discovers
Your flowers of love O flower of lovers

Francis William Bourdillon 18521921




PROVENCAL LOVERS
Aucassin And Nicolette

Within the garden of Beaucaire
He met her by a secret stair
The night was centuries ago
Said Aucassin My love my pet
These old confessors vex me so
They threaten all the pains of hell
Unless I give you up ma belle
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

Now who should there in Heaven be
To fill your place ma tresdouce mie
To reach that spot I little care
There all the droning priests are met
All the old cripples too are there
That unto shrines and altars cling
To filch the Peterpence we bring
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

There are the barefoot monks and friars
With gowns well tattered by the briars
The saints who lift their eyes and whine
I like them nota starveling set
Whod care with folk like these to dine
The other road twere just as well
That you and I should take ma belle
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

To purgatory I would go
With pleasant comrades whom we know
Fair scholars minstrels lusty knights
Whose deeds the land will not forget
The captains of a hundred fights
The men of valor and degree
Well join that gallant company
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

There too are jousts and joyance rare
And beauteous ladies debonair
The pretty dames the merry brides
Who with their wedded lords coquette
And have a friend or two besides
And all in gold and trappings gay
With furs and crests in vair and gray
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

Sweet players on the cithern strings
And they who roam the world like kings
Are gathered there so blithe and free
Pardie Id join them now my pet
If you went also ma douce mie
The joys of Heaven Id forego
To have you with me there below
Said Aucassin to Nicolette

Edmund Clarence Stedman 18331908




ON THE HURRY OF THIS TIME

With slower pen men used to write
Of old when letters were polite
In Annas or in Georges days
They could afford to turn a phrase
Or trim a struggling theme aright

They knew not steam electric light
Not yet had dazed their calmer sight
They meted out both blame and praise
With slower pen

Too swiftly now the Hours take flight
Whats read at morn is dead at night
Scant space have we for Arts delays
Whose breathless thought so briefly stays
We may not workah would we might
With slower pen

Austin Dobson 18401921




GOODNIGHT BABETTE
Si vieillesse pouvait

SceneA small neat Room In a high Voltaire Chair
 sits a whitehaired old Gentleman

Monsieur Vieuxbois Babette

 M Vieuxbois turning querulously
Day of my life Where can she get
Babette I say BabetteBabette

 Babette entering hurriedly
Coming Msieu If Msieu speaks
So loud he wont be well for weeks

 M Vieuxbois
Where have you been

 Babette
Why Msieu knows
April Ville dAvray Maamselle Rose

 M Vieuxbois
Ah I am oldand I forget
Was the place growing green Babette

 Babette
But of a greennessyes Msieu
And then the sky so blueso blue
And when I dropped my immortelle
How the birds sang
Lifting her apron to her eyes
This poor Maamselle

 M Vieuxbois
Youre a good girl Babette but she
She was an Angel verily
Sometimes I think I see her yet
Stand smiling by the cabinet
And once I know she peeped and laughed
Betwixt the curtains
Wheres the draught
She gives him a cup
Now I shall sleep I think Babette
Sing me your Norman chansonnette

 Babette sings
Once at the Angelus
Ere I was dead
Angels all glorious
Came to my bed
Angels in blue and white
Crowned on the Head

 M Vieuxbois drowsily
She was an Angel Once she laughed
What was I dreaming
Wheres the draught

 Babette showing the empty cup
The draught Msieu

 M Vieuxbois
How I forget
I am so old But sing Babette

 Babette sings
One was the Friend I left
Stark in the Snow
One was the Wife that died
Longlong ago
One was the Love I lost
How could she know

 M Vieuxbois murmuring
Ah Paul old Paul Eulalie too
And Rose And O the sky so blue

 Babette sings
One had my Mothers eyes
Wistful and mild
One had my Fathers face
One was a Child
All of them bent to me
Bent down and smiled
He is asleep

 M Vieuxbois almost inaudibly
How I forget
I am so old Goodnight Babette

A DIALOGUE FROM PLATO
Le tempo le mieux employe est celui quon perdClaude Tillier

Id read three hours Both notes and text
Were fast a mist becoming
In bounced a vagrant bee perplexed
And filled the room with humming

Then out The casements leafage sways
And parted light discloses
Miss Di with hat and booka maze
Of muslin mixed with roses

Youre reading Greek I amand you
O mines a mere romancer
So Plato is Then read himdo
And Ill read mine for answer

I read My Plato Plato too
That wisdom thus should harden
Declares blue eyes look doubly blue
Beneath a Dolly Varden

She smiled My book in turn avers
No authors name is stated
That sometimes those Philosophers
Are sadly mistranslated

But hearthe nexts in stronger style
The Cynic School asserted
That two red lips which part and smile
May not be controverted

She smiled once more My book I find
Observes some modern doctors
Would make the Cynics out a kind
Of albumverse concoctors

Then I Why not Ephesian law
No less than times tradition
Enjoined fair speech on all who saw
Dianas apparition

She blushedthis time If Platos page
No wiser precept teaches
Then Id renounce that doubtful sage
And walk to Burnham Beeches

Agreed I said For Socrates
I find he too is talking
Thinks Learning cant remain at ease
When Beauty goes awalking

She read no more I leapt the sill
The sequels scarce essential
Nay more than this I hold it still
Profoundly confidential

Austin Dobson 18401921




THE LADIES OF ST JAMESS
A Proper New Ballad Of The Country And The Town

Phyllida amo ante aliasVirgil

The ladies of St Jamess
Go swinging to the play
Their footmen run before them
With a Stand by Clear the way
But Phyllida my Phyllida
She takes her buckled shoon
When we go out acourting
Beneath the harvest moon

The ladies of St Jamess
Wear satin on their backs
They sit all night at Ombre
With candles all of wax
But Phyllida my Phyllida
She dons her russet gown
And runs to gather May dew
Before the world is down

The ladies of St Jamess
They are so fine and fair
Youd think a box of essences
Was broken in the air
But Phyllida my Phyllida
The breath of heath and furze
When breezes blow at morning
Is not so fresh as hers

The ladies of St Jamess
Theyre painted to the eyes
Their white it stays for ever
Their red it never dies
But Phyllida my Phyllida
Her color comes and goes
It trembles to a lily
It wavers to a rose

The ladies of St Jamess
You scarce can understand
The half of all their speeches
Their phrases are so grand
But Phyllida my Phyllida
Her shy and simple words
Are clear as after raindrops
The music of the birds

The ladies of St Jamess
They have their fits and freaks
They smile on youfor seconds
They frown on youfor weeks
But Phyllida my Phyllida
Come either storm or shine
From Shrovetide unto Shrovetide
Is always trueand mine

My Phyllida my Phyllida
I care not though they heap
The hearts of all St Jamess
And give me all to keep
I care not whose the beauties
Of all the world may be
For Phyllidafor Phyllida
Is all the world to me

Austin Dobson 18401921




THE CURES PROGRESS

Monsieur the Cure down the street
Comes with his kind old face
With his coat worn bare and his straggling hair
And his green umbrellacase

You may see him pass by the little Grande Place
And the tiny HoteldeVille
He smiles as he goes to the fleuriste Rose
And the pompier Theophile

He turns as a rule through the Marche cool
Where the noisy fishwives call
And his compliment pays to the Belle Therese
As she knits in her dusky stall

Theres a letter to drop at the locksmiths shop
And Toto the locksmiths niece
Has jubilant hopes for the Cure gropes
In his tails for a pain depice

Theres a little dispute with a merchant of fruit
Who is said to be heterodox
That will ended be with a Ma foi oui
And a pinch from the Cures box

There is also a word that no one heard
To the furriers daughter Lou
And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red
And a Ben Dieu garde Msieu

But a grander way for the SousPrefet
And a bow for Maamselle Anne
And a mock offhat to the Notarys cat
And a nod to the Sacristan

For ever through life the Cure goes
With a smile on his kind old face
With his coat worn bare and his straggling hair
And his green umbrellacase

Austin Dobson 18401921




A GENTLEMAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL

He lived in that past Georgian day
When men were less inclined to say
That Time is Gold and overlay
With toil their pleasure
He held some land and dwelt thereon
Where I forgetthe house is gone
His Christian name I think was John
His surname Leisure

Reynolds has painted hima face
Filled with a fine oldfashioned grace
Freshcolored frank with neer a trace
Of trouble shaded
The eyes are blue the hair is dressed
In plainest wayone hand is pressed
Deep in a flapped canary vest
With buds brocaded

He wears a brown old Brunswick coat
With silver buttonsround his throat
A soft cravatin all you note
An elder fashion
A strangeness which to us who shine
In shapely hatswhose coats combine
All harmonies of hue and line
Inspires compassion

He lived so long ago you see
Men were untravelled then but we
Like Ariel post oer land and sea
With careless parting
He found it quite enough for him
To smoke his pipe in garden trim
And watch about the fish tanks brim
The swallows darting

He liked the wellwheels creaking tongue
He liked the thrush that fed her young
He liked the drone of flies among
His netted peaches
He liked to watch the sunlight fall
Athwart his ivied orchard wall
Or pause to catch the cuckoos call
Beyond the beeches

His were the times of Paint and Patch
And yet no Ranelagh could match
The sober doves that round his thatch
Spread tails and sidled
He liked their ruffling puffed content
For him their drowsy wheelings meant
More than a Mall of Beaux that bent
Or Belles that bridled

Not that in truth when life began
He shunned the flutter of the fan
He too had maybe pinked his man
In Beautys quarrel
But now his fervent youth had flown
Where lost things go and he was grown
As staid and slowpaced as his own
Old hunter Sorrel

Yet still he loved the chase and held
That no composers score excelled
The merry horn when Sweetlip swelled
Its jovial riot
But most his measured words of praise
Caressed the anglers easy ways
His idly meditative days
His rustic diet

Not that his meditating rose
Beyond a sunny summer doze
He never troubled his repose
With fruitless prying
But held as law for high and low
What God withholds no man can know
And smiled away enquiry so
Without replying

We readalas how much we read
The jumbled strifes of creed and creed
With endless controversies feed
Our groaning tables
His booksand they sufficed himwere
Cottons Montaigne The Grave of Blair
A Waltonmuch the worse for wear
And Aesops Fables

One moreThe Bible Not that he
Had searched its page as deep as we
No sophistries could make him see
Its slender credit
It may be that he could not count
The sires and sons to Jesses fount
He liked the Sermon on the Mount
And more he read it

Once he had loved but failed to wed
A redcheeked lass who long was dead
His ways were far too slow he said
To quite forget her
And still when time had turned him gray
The earliest hawthorn buds in May
Would find his lingering feet astray
Where first he met her

In Coelo Quies heads the stone
On Leisures gravenow little known
A tangle of wildrose has grown
So thick across it
The Benefactions still declare
He left the clerk an elbowchair
And 12 Pence Yearly to Prepare
A Christmas Posset

Lie softly Leisure Doubtless you
With too serene a conscience drew
Your easy breath and slumbered through
The gravest issue
But we to whom our age allows
Scarce space to wipe our weary brows
Look down upon your narrow house
Old friend and miss you

Austin Dobson 18401921




ON A FAN
That Belonged To The Marquise De Pompadour

Chickenskin delicate white
Painted by Carlo Vanloo
Loves in a riot of light
Roses and vaporous blue
Hark to the dainty froufrou
Picture above if you can
Eyes that could melt as the dew
This was the Pompadours fan

See how they rise at the sight
Thronging the Ceil de Boeuf through
Courtiers as butterflies bright
Beauties that Fragonard drew
Talonrouge falbala queue
Cardinal Duketo a man
Eager to sigh or to sue
This was the Pompadours fan

Ah but things more than polite
Hung on this toy voyezvous
Matters of state and of might
Things that great ministers do
Things that maybe overthrew
Those in whose brains they began
Here was the sign and the cue
This was the Pompadours fan

ENVOY
Where are the secrets it knew
Weavings of plot and of plan
But where is the Pompadour too
This was the Pompadours Fan

Austin Dobson 18401921




WHEN I SAW YOU LAST ROSE

When I saw you last Rose
You were only so high
How fast the time goes

Like a bud ere it blows
You just peeped at the sky
When I saw you last Rose

Now your petals unclose
Now your Maytime is nigh
How fast the time goes

And a lifehow it grows
You were scarcely so shy
When I saw you last Rose

In your bosom it shows
Theres a guest on the sly
How fast the time goes

Is it Cupid Who knows
Yet you used not to sigh
When I saw you last Rose
How fast the time goes

Austin Dobson 18401921




URCEUS EXIT

I intended an Ode
And it turned to a Sonnet
It began a la mode
I intended an Ode
But Rose crossed the road
In her latest new bonnet
I intended an Ode
And it turned to a Sonnet

Austin Dobson 18401921




A CORSAGE BOUQUET

Myrtilla tonight
Wears Jacqueminot roses
Shes the loveliest sight
Myrtilla tonight
Correspondingly light
My pocketbook closes
Myrtilla tonight
Wears Jacqueminot roses

TWO TRIOLETS

What he said
This kiss upon your fan I press
Ah Sainte Nitouche you dont refuse it
And may it from its soft recess
This kiss upon your fan I press
Be blown to you a shy caress
By this white down wheneer you use it
This kiss upon your fan I press
Ah Sainte Nitouche you dont refuse it

What she thought
To kiss a fan
What a poky poet
The stupid man
To kiss a fan
When he knowsthathecan
Or ought to know it
To kiss a fan
What a poky poet

Harrison Robertson 1856




THE BALLAD OF DEAD LADIES
From The French Of Francois Villon 1450

Tell me now in what hidden way is
Lady Flora the lovely Roman
Wheres Hipparchia and where is Thais
Neither of them the fairer woman
Where is Echo beheld of no man
Only heard on river and mere
She whose beauty was more than human
But where are the snows of yesteryear

Wheres Heloise the learned nun
For whose sake Abeilard I ween
Lost manhood and put priesthood on
From Love he won such dule and teen
And where I pray you is the Queen
Who willed that Buridan should steer
Sewed in a sacks mouth down the Seine
But where are the snows of yesteryear

White Queen Blanche like a queen of lilies
With a voice like any mermaiden
Bertha Broadfoot Beatrice Alice
And Ermengarde the lady of Maine
And that good Joan whom Englishmen
At Rouen doomed and burned her there
Mother of God where are they then
But where are the snows of yesteryear

Nay never ask this week fair lord
Where they are gone nor yet this year
Except with this for an overword
But where are the snows of yesteryear

Dante Gabriel Rossetti 18281882




BALLADE OF DEAD LADIES
After Villon

Nay tell me now in what strange air
The Roman Flora dwells today
Where Archippiada hides and where
Beautiful Thais has passed away
Whence answers Echo afield astray
By mere or streamaround below
Lovelier she than a woman of clay
Nay but where is the last years snow

Where is wise Heloise that care
Brought on Abeilard and dismay
All for her love he found a snare
A maimed poor monk in orders gray
And wheres the Queen who willed to slay
Buridan that in a sack must go
Afloat down Seinea perilous way
Nay but where is the last years snow

Wheres that White Queen a lily rare
With her sweet song the Sirens lay
Wheres Bertha Broadfoot Beatrice fair
Alys and Ermengarde where are they
Good Joan whom English did betray
In Rouen town and burned her No
Maiden and Queen no man may say
Nay but where is the last years snow

ENVOY
Prince all this week thou needst not pray
Nor yet this year the thing to know
One burden answers ever and aye
Nay but where is the last years snow

Andrew Lang 18441912




A BALLAD OF DEAD LADIES
After Villon
From If I Were King

I wonder in what Isle of Bliss
Apollos music fills the air
In what green valley Artemis
For young Endymion spreads the snare
Where Venus lingers debonair
The Wind has blown them all away
And Pan lies piping in his lair
Where are the Gods of Yesterday

Say where the great Semiramis
Sleeps in a rosered tomb and where
The precious dust of Caesar is
Or Cleopatras yellow hair
Where Alexander DoandDare
The Wind has blown them all away
And Redbeard of the Iron Chair
Where are the Dreams of Yesterday

Where is the Queen of Herods kiss
And Phryne in her beauty bare
By what strange sea does Tomyris
With Dido and Cassandra share
Divine Proserpinas despair
The Wind has blown them all away
For what poor ghost does Helen care
Where are the Girls of Yesterday

ENVOY
Alas for lovers Pair by pair
The Wind has blown them all away
The young and yare the fond and fair
Where are the Snows of Yesterday

Justin Huntly McCarthy 18601936




IF I WERE KING
After Villon
From If I Were King

All French folk wheresoer ye be
Who love your country sail and sand
From Paris to the Breton sea
And back again to Norman strand
Forsooth ye seem a silly band
Sheep without shepherd left to chance
Far otherwise our Fatherland
If Villon were the King of France

The figure on the throne you see
Is nothing but a puppet planned
To wear the regal bravery
Of silken coat and gilded wand
Not so we Frenchmen understand
The Lord of lions heart and glance
And such a one would take command
If Villon were the King of France

His counsellors are rogues Perdie
While men of honest mind are banned
To creak upon the Gallows Tree
Or squeal in prisons overmanned
We want a chief to bear the brand
And bid the damned Burgundians dance
God Where the Oriflamme should stand
If Villon were the King of France

ENVOY
Louis the Little play the grand
Buffet the foe with sword and lance
Tis what would happen by this hand
If Villon were the King of France

Justin Huntly McCarthy 18601936




A BALLADE OF SUICIDE

The gallows in my garden people say
Is new and neat and adequately tall
I tie the noose on in a knowing way
As one that knots his necktie for a ball
But just as all the neighborson the wall
Are drawing a long breath to shout Hurray
The strangest whim has seized me After all
I think I will not hang myself today

Tomorrow is the time I get my pay
My uncles sword is hanging in the hall
I see a little cloud all pink and gray
Perhaps the rectors mother will not call
I fancy that I heard from Mr Gall
That mushrooms could be cooked another way
I never read the works of Juvenal
I think I will not hang myself today

The world will have another washing day
The decadents decay the pedants pall
And H G Wells has found that children play
And Bernard Shaw discovered that they squall
Rationalists are growing rational
And through thick woods one finds a stream astray
So secret that the very sky seems small
I think I will not hang myself today

ENVOI
Prince I can hear the trumpet of Germinal
The tumbrils toiling up the terrible way
Even today your royal head may fall
I think I will not hang myself today

Gilbert Keith Chesterton 18741936




CHIFFONS

Through this our city of delight
This Paris of our joy and play
This Paris perfumed jeweled bright
Rouged powdered amorousennuye
Across our gilded Quartier
So fair to see so frail au fond
Echoesmon Dieuthe Ragmans bray
Marchand dhabits Chiffons

Foul hunched a plague to dainty sight
He limps infect by park and quai
Voicing for those that hear aright
His hungerworld the dark Marais
Sexton of all we waste and fray
He bags at last pour tout de bon
Our trappings rare our braveries gay

THE COURT HISTORIAN
Lower Empire Circa A D 700

The Monk Arnulphus uncorked his ink
That shone with a bloodred light
Just now as the sun began to sink
His vellum was pumiced a silvery white
The Basileusfor so he began
Is a royal sagacious Mars of a man
Than the very lion bolder
He has married the stately widow of Thrace
Hush cried a voice at his shoulder

His palette gleamed with a burnished green
Bright as a dragonflys skin
His goldleaf shone like the robe of a queen
His azure glowed as a cloud worn thin
Deep as the blue of the kingwhales lair
The Porphyrogenita Zoe the fair
Is about to wed with a Prince much older
Of an unpropitious mien and look
Hush cried a voice at his shoulder

The red flowers trellised the parchment page
The birds leaped up on the spray
The yellow fruit swayed and drooped and swung
It was Autumn mixed up with May
O but his cheek was shrivelled and shrunk
The child of the Basileus wrote the Monk
Is goldenhairedtender the Queens arms fold her
Her stepmother Zoe doth love her so
Hush cried a voice at his shoulder

The Kings and Martyrs and Saints and Priests
All gathered to guard the text
There was Daniel snug in the lions den
Singing no whit perplexed
Brazen Samson with spear and helm
The Queen wrote the Monk rules firm this realm
For the King gets older and older
The Norseman Thorkill is brave and fair
Hush cried a voice at his shoulder

Walter Thornbury 18281876




MISS LOU

When thinstrewn memory I look through
I see most clearly poor Miss Loo
Her tabby cat her cage of birds
Her nose her hairher muffled words
And how she would open her green eyes
As if in some immense surprise
Whenever as we sat at tea
She made some small remark to me

Tis always drowsy summer when
From out the past she comes again
The westering sunshine in a pool
Floats in her parlor still and cool
While the slim bird its lean wires shakes
As into piercing song it breaks
Till Peters palegreen eyes ajar
Dream wake wake dream in one brief bar
And I am sitting dull and shy
And she with gaze of vacancy

And large hands folded on the tray
Musing the afternoon away
Her satin bosom heaving slow
With sighs that softly ebb and flow
And her plain face in such dismay
It seems unkind to look her way
Until all cheerful back will come
Her gentle gleaming spirit home
And one would think that poor Miss Loo
Asked nothing else if she had you

Walter De la Mare 1873




THE POET AND THE WOODLOUSE

A portly Woodlouse full of cares
Transacted eminent affairs
Along a parapet where pears
Unripened fell
And vines embellished the sweet airs
With muscatel

Day after day beheld him run
His scales atwinkle in the sun
About his business never done
Nights slender span he
Spent in the home his wealth had won
A redbrick cranny

Thus as his Sense of Right directed
He lived both honored and respected
Cherished his children and protected
His duteous wife
And naught of diffidence deflected
His useful life

One midday hastening to his Club
He spied beside a watertub
The owner of each plant and shrub
A humble Bard
Who turned upon the conscious grub
A mild regard

Eh quoth the Woodlouse Can it be
A Higher Power looks down to see
My praiseworthy activity
And notes me plying
My Daily TaskNor strange dear me
But gratifying

To whom the Bard I still divest
My orchard of the Insect Pest
That you are such is manifest
Prepare to die
And yet how sweetly does your crest
Reflect the sky

Go then forgiven for what ails
Your naughty life this fact avails
Tu pardon mirror in your scales
Celestial blue
Till the sun sets and the light fails
The skies and you



May all we proud and bustling parties
Whose lot in forum street and mart is
Stand in conspectu Deitatis
And save our face
Reflecting where our scaly heart is
Some skyey grace

Helen Parry Eden 18




STUDENTS

John Brown and Jeanne at Fontainebleau
Twas Toussaint just a year ago
Crimson and copper was the glow
Of all the woods at Fontainebleau
They peered into that ancient well
And watched the slow torch as it fell
John gave the keeper two whole sous
And Jeanne that smile with which she woos
John Brown to folly So they lose
The Paris train But never mind
AllSaints are rustling in the wind
And theres an inn a crackling fire
Its deuxcinquante but Jeannes desire
Theres dinner candles country wine
Jeannes lipsphilosophy divine
There was a bosquet at Saint Cloud
Wherein Johns picture of her grew
To be a Salon masterpiece
Till the rain fell that would not cease
Through one long alley how they raced
Twas gold and brown and all a waste
Of matted leaves mossinterlaced
Shades of mad queens and hunterkings
And thornsharp feet of dryadthings
Were company to their wanderings
Then rain and darkness on them drew
The rich folks motors honked and flew
They hailed an old cab heaven for two
The bright ChampsElysees at last
Though the cab crawled it sped too fast

Paris upspringing white and gold
Flamboyant arch and highenscrolled
Warsculpture big Napoleonic
Fierce chargers angels histrionic
The royal sweep of gardened spaces
The pomp and whirl of columned Places
The Rive Gauche ageold gay and gray
The impasse and the loved cafe
The tempting tidy little shops
The convent walls the glimpsed treetops
Bookstalls old men like dwarfs in plays
Talk work and Latin Quarter ways

MayRobinsons the chestnut trees
Were ever crowds as gay as these
The quick pale waiters on a run
The round green tables one by one
Hidden away in amorous bowers
Lilac laburnums golden showers
Kiss clink of glasses laughter heard
And nightingales quite undeterred
And then that last extravagance
O Jeanne a single amber glance
Will pay himLets play millionaire
For just two hourson princely fare
At some hotel where lovers dine
A deux and pledge across the wine
They find a damask breakfastroom
Where stiff silk roses range their bloom
The garcon has a splendid way
Of bearing in grand dejeuner
Then to be left alone alone
High up above Rue Castiglione
Curtained away from all the rude
Rumors in silken solitude
And John her head upon your knees
Time waits for moments such as these

Florence Wilkinson 18




ONE TWO THREE

It was an old old old old lady
And a boy that was halfpast three
And the way that they played together
Was beautiful to see

She couldnt go running and jumping
And the boy no more could he
For he was a thin little fellow
With a thin little twisted knee

They sat in the yellow sunlight
Out under the maple tree
And the game that they played Ill tell you
Just as it was told to me

It was HideandGoSeek they were playing
Though youd never have known it to be
With an old old old old lady
And a boy with a twisted knee

The boy would bend his face down
On his one little sound right knee
And hed guess where she was hiding
In guesses One Two Three

You are in the chinacloset
He would cry and laugh with glee
It wasnt the china closet
But he still had Two and Three

You are up in papas big bedroom
In the chest with the queer old key
And she said You are warm and warmer
But youre not quite right said she

It cant be the little cupboard
Where mammas things used to be
So it must be the clothespress Granma
And he found her with his Three

Then she covered her face with her fingers
That were wrinkled and white and wee
And she guessed where the boy was hiding
With a One and a Two and a Three

And they never had stirred from their places
Right under the maple tree
This old old old old lady
And the boy with the lame little knee
This dear dear dear old lady
And the boy who was halfpast three

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896




THE CHAPERON

I take my chaperon to the play
She thinks shes taking me
And the gilded youth who owns the box
A proud young man is he
But how would his young heart be hurt
If he could only know
That not for his sweet sake I go
Nor yet to see the trifling show
But to see my chaperon flirt

Her eyes beneath her snowy hair
They sparkle young as mine
Theres scarce a wrinkle in her hand
So delicate and fine
And when my chaperon is seen
They come from everywhere
The dear old boys with silvery hair
With oldtime grace and oldtime air
To greet their oldtime queen

They bow as my young Midas here
Will never learn to bow
The dancingmasters do not teach
That gracious reverence now
With voices quavering just a bit
They play their old parts through
They talk of folk who used to woo
Of hearts that broke in fiftytwo
Now none the worse for it

And as those aged crickets chirp
I watch my chaperons face
And see the dear old features take
A new and tender grace
And in her happy eyes I see
Her youth awakening bright
With all its hope desire delight
Ah me I wish that I were quite
As youngas young as she

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896




A PITCHER OF MIGNONETTE

A pitcher of mignonette
In a tenements highest casement
Queer sort of flowerpotyet
That pitcher of mignonette
Is a garden in heaven set
To the little sick child in the basement
The pitcher of mignonette
In the tenements highest casement

Henry Cuyler Bunner 18551896




OLD KING COLE

In Tilbury Town did Old King Cole
A wise old age anticipate
Desiring with his pipe and bowl
No Khans extravagant estate
No crown annoyed his honest head
No fiddlers three were called or needed
For two disastrous heirs instead
Made music more that ever three did

Bereft of her with whom his life
Was harmony without a flaw
He took no other for a wife
Nor sighed for any that he saw
And if he doubted his two sons
And heirs Alexis and Evander
He might have been as doubtful once
Of Robert Burns and Alexander

Alexis in his early youth
Began to stealfrom old and young
Likewise Evander and the truth
Was like a bad taste on his tongue
Born thieves and liars their affair
Seemed only to be tarred with evil
The most insufferable pair
Of scamps that ever cheered the devil

The world went on their fame went on
And they went onfrom bad to worse
Till goaded hot with nothing done
And each accoutered with a curse
The friends of Old King Cole by twos
And fours and sevens and elevens
Pronounced unalterable views
Of doings that were not of Heavens

And having learned again whereby
Their baleful zeal had come about
King Cole met many a wrathful eye
So kindly that its wrath went out
Or partly out Say what they would
He seemed the more to court their candor
But never told what kind of good
Was in Alexis and Evander

And Old King Cole with many a puff
That haloed his urbanity
Would smoke till he had smoked enough
And listen most attentively
He beamed as with an inward light
That had the Lords assurance in it
And once a man was there all night
Expecting something every minute

But whether from too little thought
Or too much fealty to the bowl
A dim reward was all he got
For sitting up with Old King Cole
Though mine the father mused aloud
Are not the sons I would have chosen
Shall I less evilly endowed
By their infirmity be frozen

Theyll have a bad end Ill agree
But I was never born to groan
For I can see what I can see
And Im accordingly alone
With open heart and open door
I love my friends I like my neighbors
But if I try to tell you more
Your doubts will overmatch my labors

This pipe would never make me calm
This bowl my grief would never drown
For grief like mine there is no balm
In Gilead or in Tilbury Town
And if I see what I can see
I know not any way to blind it
Nor more if any way may be
For you to grope or fly to find it

There may be room for ruin yet
And ashes for a wasted love
Or like One whom you may forget
I may have meat you know not of
And if Id rather live than weep
Meanwhile do you find that surprising
Why bless my soul the mans asleep
Thats good The sun will soon be rising

Edwin Arlington Robinson 18691935




THE MASTER MARINER

My grandshire sailed three years from home
And slew unmoved the sounding whale
Here on the windless beach I roam
And watch far out the hardy sail

The lions of the surf that cry
Upon this lioncolored shore
On reefs of midnight met his eye
He knew their fangs as I their roar

My grandsire sailed uncharted seas
And toll of all their leagues he took
I scan the shallow bays at ease
And tell their colors in a book

The anchorchains his music made
And wind in shrouds and runninggear
The thrush at dawn beguiles my glade
And once tis said I woke to hear

My grandsire in his ample fist
The long harpoon upheld to men
Behold obedient to my wrist
A gray gullsfeather for my pen

Upon my grandsires leathern cheek
Five zones their bitter bronze had set
Some day their hazards I will seek
I promise me at times Not yet

I think my grandsire now would turn
A mild but speculative eye
On me my pen and its concern
Then gaze again to seaand sigh

George Sterling 18691926




A ROSE TO THE LIVING

A rose to the living is more
Than sumptuous wreaths to the dead
In filling loves infinite store
A rose to the living is more
If graciously given before
The hungering spirit is fled
A rose to the living is more
Than sumptuous wreaths to the dead

Nixon Waterman 1859




A KISS

Rose kissed me today
Will she kiss me tomorrow
Let it be as it may
Rose kissed me today
But the pleasure gives way
To a savor of sorrow
Rose kissed me today
Will she kiss me tomorrow

Austin Dobson 18401921




BIFTEK AUX CHAMPIGNONS

Mimi do you remember
Dont get behind your fan
That morning in September
On the cliffs of Grand Manan
Where to the shock of Fundy
The topmost harebells sway
Campanula rotundi
folia cf Gray

On the pastures high and level
That overlook the sea
Where I wondered what the devil
Those little things could be
That Mimi stooped to gather
As she strolled across the down
And held her dress skirt rather
Oh now you need nt frown

For you know the dew was heavy
And your boots I know were thin
So a little extra brevi
ty in skirts was sure no sin
Besides who minds a cousin
First second even third
Ive kissed em by the dozen
And they never once demurred

If ones allowed to ask it
Quoth I  ma belle cousine
What have you in your basket
Those baskets white and green
The brave Passamaquoddies
Weave out of scented grass
And sell to tourist bodies
Who through Mt Desert pass

You answered slightly frowning
Put down your stupid book
That everlasting Browning
And come and help me look
Mushroom you spik him English
I call him champignon
Ill teach you to distinguish
The right kind from the wrong

There was no fog on Fundy
That blue September day
The west wind for that one day
Had swept it all away
The lighthouse glasses twinkled
The white gulls screamed and flew
The merry sheepbells tinkled
The merry breezes blew

The bayberry aromatic
The papery immortelle
That give our grandmas attic
That sentimental smell
Tied up in little brushbrooms
Were sweet as newmown hay
While we went hunting mushrooms
That blue September day

Henry Augustin Beers 18471926




EVOLUTION

When you were a Tadpole and I was a Fish
In the Paleozoic time
And side by side on the ebbing tide
We sprawled through the ooze and slime
Or skittered with many a caudal flip
Through the depths of the Cambrian fen
My heart was rife with the joy of life
For I loved you even then

Mindless we lived mindless we loved
And mindless at last we died
And deep in the rift of a Caradoc drift
We slumbered side by side
The world turned on in the lathe of time
The hot sands heaved amain
Till we caught our breath from the womb of death
And crept into life again

We were Amphibians scaled and tailed
And drab as a dead mans hand
We coiled at ease neath the dripping trees
Or trailed through the mud and sand
Croaking and blind with our threeclawed feet
Writing a language dumb
With never a spark in the empty dark
To hint at a life to come

Yet happy we lived and happy we loved
And happy we died once more
Our forms were rolled in the clinging mold
Of a Neocomian shore
The aeons came and the aeons fled
And the sleep that wrapped us fast
Was riven away in a newer day
And the night of death was past

Then light and swift through the jungle trees
We swung in our airy flights
Or breathed the balms of the fronded palms
In the hush of the moonless nights
And oh what beautiful years were these
When our hearts clung each to each
When life was filled and our senses thrilled
In the first faint dawn of speech

Thus life by life and love by love
We passed through the cycles strange
And breath by breath and death by death
We followed the chain of change
Till there came a time in the law of life
When over the nursing sod
The shadows broke and the soul awoke
In a strange dim dream of God

I was thewed like an Aurocks bull
And tusked like the great CaveBear
And you my sweet from head to feet
Were gowned in your glorious hair
Deep in the gloom of a fireless cave
When the night fell oer the plain
And the moon hung red oer the river bed
We mumbled the bones of the slain

I flaked a flint to a cutting edge
And shaped it with brutish craft
I broke a shank from the woodland dank
And fitted it head to haft
Then I hid me close in the reedy tarn
Where the Mammoth came to drink
Through brawn and bone I drave the stone
And slew him upon the brink

Loud I howled through the moonlit wastes
Loud answered our kith and kin
From west and east to the crimson feast
The clan came trooping in
Oer joint and gristle and padded hoof
We fought and clawed and tore
And cheek by jowl with many a growl
We talked the marvel oer

I carved that fight on a reindeer bone
With rude and hairy hand
I pictured his fall on the cavern wall
That men might understand
For we lived by blood and the right of might
Ere human laws were drawn
And the Age of Sin did not begin
Till our brutal tusks were gone

And that was a million years ago
In a time that no man knows
Yet here tonight in the mellow light
We sit at Delmonicos
Your eyes are deep as the Devon springs
Your hair is as dark as jet
Your years are few your life is new
Your soul untried and yet

Our trail is on the Kimmeridge clay
And the scarp of the Purbeck flags
We have left our bones in the Bagshot stones
And deep in the Coralline crags
Our love is old and our lives are old
And death shall come amain
Should it come today what man may say
We shall not live again

God wrought our souls from the Tremadoc beds
And furnished them wings to fly
He sowed our spawn in the worlds dim dawn
And I know that it shall not die
Though cities have sprung above the graves
Where the crookboned men made war
And the oxwain creaks oer the buried caves
Where the mummied mammoths are

Then as we linger at luncheon here
Oer many a dainty dish
Let us drink anew to the time when you
Were a Tadpole and I was a Fish

A REASONABLE AFFLICTION

On his deathbed poor Lubin lies
His spouse is in despair
With frequent cries and mutual sighs
They both express their care

A different cause says Parson Sly
The same effect may give
Poor Lubin fears that he may die
His wife that he may live

Matthew Prior 16641721




A MORAL IN SEVRES

Upon my mantelpiece they stand
While all its length between them lies
He throws a kiss with graceful hand
She glances back with bashful eyes

The china Shepherdess is fair
The Shepherds face denotes a heart
Burning with ardor and despair
Alas they stand so far apart

And yet perhaps if they were moved
And stood together day by day
Their love had not so constant proved
Nor would they still have smiled so gay

His hand the Shepherd might have kissed
The matchbox Angels heart to win
The Shepherdess his love have missed
And flirted with the Mandarin

But on my mantelpiece they stand
While all its length between them lies
He throws a kiss with graceful hand
She glances back with bashful eyes

Mildred Howells 1872




ON THE FLYLEAF OF A BOOK OF OLD PLAYS

At Catos Head in Russell Street
These leaves she sat astitching
I fancy she was trim and neat
Blueeyed and quite bewitching

Before her on the street below
All powder ruffs and laces
There strutted idle London beaux
To ogle pretty faces

While filling many a Sedan chair
With monstrous hoop and feather
In paint and powder Londons fair
Went trooping past together

Swift Addison and Pope mayhap
They sauntered slowly past her
Or printers boy with gown and cap
For Steele went trotting faster

For beau nor wit had she a look
Nor lord nor lady minding
She bent her head above this book
Attentive to her binding

And one stray thread of golden hair
Caught on her nimble fingers
Was stitched within this volume where
Until today it lingers

Past and forgotten beaux and fair
Wigs powder all outdated
A queer antique the Sedan chair
Pope stiff and antiquated

Yet as I turn these odd old plays
This single stray lock finding
Im back in those forgotten days
And watch her at her binding

THE TALENTED MAN
Letter From A Lady In London To A Lady At Lausanne

Dear Alice youll laugh when you know it
Last week at the Duchesss ball
I danced with the clever new poet
Youve heard of himTully St Paul
Miss Jonquil was perfectly frantic
I wish you had seen Lady Anne
It really was very romantic
He is such a talented man

He came up from Brazen Nose College
Just caught as they call it this spring
And his head love is stuffed full of knowledge
Of every conceivable thing
Of science and logic he chatters
As fine and as fast as he can
Though I am no judge of such matters
Im sure hes a talented man

His stories and jests are delightful
Not stories or jests dear for you
The jests are exceedingly spiteful
The stories not always quite true
Perhaps to be kind and veracious
May do pretty well at Lausanne
But it never would answergood gracious
Chez nousin a talented man

He sneershow my Alice would scold him
At the bliss of a sigh or a tear
He laughedonly thinkwhen I told him
How we cried oer Trevelyan last year
I vow I was quite in a passion
I broke all the sticks of my fan
But sentiments quite out of fashion
It seems in a talented man

Lady Bab who is terribly moral
Has told me that Tully is vain
And aptwhich is sillyto quarrel
And fondwhich is sadof champagne
I listened and doubted dear Alice
For I saw when my Lady began
It was only the Dowagers malice
She does hate a talented man

Hes hideous I own it But fame love
Is all that these eyes can adore
Hes lamebut Lord Byron was lame love
And dumpybut so is Tom Moore
Then his voicesuch a voice my sweet creature
Its like your Aunt Lucys toucan
But oh whats a tone or a feature
When once ones a talented man

My mother you know all the season
Has talked of Sir Geoffreys estate
And truly to do the fool reason
He has been less horrid of late
But today when we drive in the carriage
Ill tell her to lay down her plan
If ever I venture on marriage
It must be a talented man

PSI have found on reflection
One fault in my friendentre nous
Without it hed just be perfection
Poor fellow he has not a sou
And so when he comes in September
To shoot with my uncle Sir Dan
Ive promised mamma to remember
Hes only a talented man

A LETTER OF ADVICE
From Miss Medora Trevilian At Padua
To Miss Araminta Vavasour In London

Enfin Monsieur homme aimable
Voila pourquoi je ne saurais laimerScribe

You tell me youre promised a lover
My own Araminta next week
Why cannot my fancy discover
The hue of his coat and his cheek
Alas if he look like another
A vicar a banker a beau
Be deaf to your father and mother
My own Araminta say No

Miss Lane at her Temple of Fashion
Taught us both how to sing and to speak
And we loved one another with passion
Before we had been there a week
You gave me a ring for a token
I wear it wherever I go
I gave you a chainit is broken
My own Araminta say No

O think of our favorite cottage
And think of our dear Lalla Rookh
How we shared with the milkmaids their pottage
And drank of the stream from the brook
How fondly our loving lips faltered
What further can grandeur bestow
My heart is the sameis yours altered
My own Araminta say No

Remember the thrilling romances
We read on the bank in the glen
Remember the suitors our fancies
Would picture for both of us then
They wore the red cross on their shoulder
They had vanquished and pardoned their foe
Sweet friend are you wiser or colder
My own Araminta say No

You know when Lord Rigmaroles carriage
Drove off with your cousin Justine
You wept dearest girl at the marriage
And whispered How base she has been
You said you were sure it would kill you
If ever your husband looked so
And you will not apostatizewill you
My own Araminta say No

When I heard I was going abroad love
I thought I was going to die
We walked arm in arm to the road love
We looked arm in arm to the sky
And I said When a foreign postilion
Has hurried me off to the Po
Forget not Medora Trevilian
My own Araminta say No

We parted but sympathys fetters
Reach far over valley and hill
I muse oer your exquisite letters
And feel that your heart is mine still
And he who would share it with me love
The richest of treasures below
If hes not what Orlando should be love
My own Araminta say No

If he wears a topboot in his wooing
If he comes to you riding a cob
If he talks of his baking or brewing
If he puts up his feet on the hob
If he ever drinks port after dinner
If his brow or his breeding is low
If he calls himself Thompson or Skinner
My own Araminta say No

If he studies the news in the papers
While you are preparing the tea
If he talks of the damps or the vapors
While moonlight lies soft on the sea
If hes sleepy while you are capricious
If he has not a musical Oh
If he does not call Werther delicious
My own Araminta say No

If he ever Sets foot in the city
Among the stockbrokers and Jews
If he has not a heart full of pity
If he dont stand six feet in his shoes
If his lips are not redder than roses
If his hands are not whiter than snow
If he has not the model of noses
My own Araminta say No

If he speaks of a tax or a duty
If he does not look grand on his knees
If hes blind to a landscape of beauty
Hills valleys rocks waters and trees
If he dotes not on desolate towers
If he likes not to hear the blast blow
If he knows not the language of flowers
My own Araminta say No

He must walk like a god of old story
Come down from the home of his rest
He must smile like the sun in his glory
On the buds he loves ever the best
And oh from its ivory portal
Like music his soft speech must flow
If he speak smile or walk like a mortal
My own Araminta say No

Dont listen to tales of his bounty
Dont hear what they say of his birth
Dont look at his seat in the county
Dont calculate what he is worth
But give him a theme to write verse on
And see if he turns out his toe
If hes only an excellent person
My own Araminta say No

Winthrop Mackworth Praed 18021839




A NICE CORRESPONDENT

There are plenty of roses the patriarch speaks
Alas not for me on your lips and your cheeks
Fair maiden roseladen enough and to spare
Spare spare me that rose that you wear in your hair

The glow and the glory are plighted
To darkness for evening is come
The lamp in Glebe Cottage is lighted
The birds and the sheepbells are dumb
Im alone for the others have flitted
To dine with a neighbor at Kew
Alone but Im not to be pitied
Im thinking of you

I wish you were here Were I duller
Than dull youd be dearer than dear
I am dressed in your favorite color
Dear Fred how I wish you were here
I am wearing my lazuli necklace
The necklace you fastened askew
Was there ever so rude or so reckless
A Darling as you

I want you to come and pass sentence
On two or three books with a plot
Of course you know Janets Repentance
I am reading Sir Waverley Scott
That story of Edgar and Lucy
How thrilling romantic and true
The Master his bride was a goosey
Reminds me of you

They tell me Cockaigne has been crowning
A Poet whose garland endures
It was you that first told me of Browning
That stupid old Browning of yours
His vogue and his verve are alarming
Im anxious to give him his due
But Fred hes not nearly so charming
A Poet as you

I heard how you shot at The Beeches
I saw how you rode Chanticleer
I have read the report of your speeches
And echoed the echoing cheer
Theres a whisper of hearts you are breaking
Dear Fred I believe it I do
Small marvel that Folly is making
Her Idol of you

Alas for the World and its dearly
Bought triumphits fugitive bliss
Sometimes I half wish I were merely
A plain or a penniless Miss
But perhaps one is blest with a measure
Of pelf and Im not sorry too
That Im pretty because its a pleasure
My Darling to you

Your whim is for frolic and fashion
Your taste is for letters and art
This rhyme is the commonplace passion
That glows in a fond womans heart
Lay it by in some sacred deposit
For relicswe all have a few
Love some day theyll print it because it
Was written to You

Frederick LockerLampson 18211895




HER LETTER

Im sitting alone by the fire
Dressed just as I came from the dance
In a robe even you would admire
It cost a cool thousand in France
Im bediamonded out of all reason
My hair is done up in a cue
In short sir the belle of the season
Is wasting an hour upon you

A dozen engagements Ive broken
I left in the midst of a set
Likewise a proposal half spoken
That waitson the stairsfor me yet
They say hell be richwhen he grows up
And then he adores me indeed
And you sir are turning your nose up
Three thousand miles off as you read

And how do I like my position
And what do I think of New York
And now in my higher ambition
With whom do I waltz flirt or talk
And isnt it nice to have riches
And diamonds and silks and all that
And arent they a change to the ditches
And tunnels of Poverty Flat

Well yesif you saw us out driving
Each day in the Park fourinhand
If you saw poor dear mamma contriving
To look supernaturally grand
If you saw papas picture as taken
By Brady and tinted at that
Youd never suspect he sold bacon
And flour at Poverty Flat

And yet just this moment when sitting
In the glare of the grand chandelier
In the bustle and glitter befitting
The finest soiree of the year
In the mists of a gaze de Chambery
And the hum of the smallest of talk
Somehow Joe I thought of the Ferry
And the dance that we had on The Fork

Of Harrisons bar with its muster
Of flags festooned over the wall
Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
And tallow on headdress and shawl
Of the steps that we took to one fiddle
Of the dress of my queer visavis
And how I once went down the middle
With the man that shot Sandy McGee

Of the moon that was quietly sleeping
On the hill when the time came to go
Of the few baby peaks that were peeping
From under their bedclothes of snow
Of that ridethat to me was the rarest
Ofthe something you said at the gate
Ah Joe then I wasnt an heiress
To the bestpaying lead in the State

Well well its all past yet its funny
To think as I stood in the glare
Of fashion and beauty and money
That I should be thinking right there
Of some one who breasted high water
And swam the North Fork and all that
Just to dance with old Folinsbees daughter
The Lily of Poverty Flat

But goodness what nonsense Im writing
Mamma says my taste still is low
Instead of my triumphs reciting
Im spooning on Josephheighho
And Im to be finished by travel
Whatevers the meaning of that
Oh why did papa strike pay gravel
In drifting on Poverty Flat

Goodnightheres the end of my paper
Goodnightif the longitude please
For maybe while wasting my taper
Your suns climbing over the trees
But know if you havent got riches
And are poor dearest Joe and all that
That my hearts somewhere there in the ditches
And youve struck iton Poverty Flat

Bret Harte 18301902




A DEAD LETTER
A coeur blesselombre et le silenceBalzac

I
I drew it from its china tomb
It came out feebly scented
With some thin ghost of past perfume
That dust and days had lent it

An old old letterfolded still
To read with due composure
I sought the sunlit windowsill
Above the gray enclosure

That glimmering in the sultry haze
Faintflowered dimly shaded
Slumbered like Goldsmiths Madam Blaize
Bedizened and brocaded

A queer old place Youd surely say
Some teaboard gardenmaker
Had planned it in Dutch Williams day
To please some florist Quaker

So trim it was The yewtrees still
With pious care perverted
Grew in the same grim shapes and still
The lipless dolphin spurted

Still in his wonted state abode
The brokennosed Apollo
And still the cypressarbor showed
The same umbrageous hollow

Onlyas fresh young Beauty gleams
From coffeecolored laces
So peeped from its oldfashioned dreams
The fresher modern traces

For idle mallet hoop and ball
Upon the lawn were lying
A magazine a tumbled shawl
Round which the swifts were flying

And tossed beside the Guelder rose
A heap of rainbow knitting
Where blinking in her pleased repose
A Persian cat was sitting

A place to love inlivefor aye
If we too like Tithonus
Could find some God to stretch the gray
Scant life the Fates have thrown us

But now by steam we run our race
With buttoned heart and pocket
Our Loves a gilded surplus grace
Just like an empty locket

The time is out of joint Who will
May strive to make it better
For me this warm old windowsill
And this old dusty letter

II
Dear John the letter ran it cant cant be
For Fathers gone to Chorley Fair with Sam
And Mothers storing ApplesPrue and Me
Up to our Elbows making Damson Jam
But we shall meet before a Week is gone
Tis a long Lane that has no Turning John

Only till Sunday next and then youll wait
Behind the WhiteThorn by the broken Stile
We can go round and catch them at the Gate
All to Ourselves for nearly one long Mile
Dear Prue wont look and Father hell go on
And Sams two Eyes are all for Cissy John

John shes so smartwith every Ribbon new
Flamecolored Sack and Crimson Padesoy
As proud as proud and has the Vapors too
Just like My Ladycalls poor Sam a Boy
And vows no Sweethearts worth the Thinkingon
Till hes past Thirty I know better John

My Dear I dont think that I thought of much
Before we knew each other I and you
And now why John your least least Fingertouch
Gives me enough to think a Summer through
See for I send you Something There tis gone
Look in this cornermind you find it John

III
This was the matter of the note
A longforgot deposit
Dropped in an Indian dragons throat
Deep in a fragrant closet

Piled with a dapper Dresden world
Beaux beauties prayers and poses
Bonzes with squat legs undercurled
And great jars filled with roses

Ah heart that wrote Ah lips that kissed
You had no thought or presage
Into what keeping you dismissed
Your simple oldworld message

A reverent one Though we today
Distrust beliefs and powers
The artless ageless things you say
Are fresh as Mays own flowers

I need not search too much to find
Whose lot it was to send it
That feel upon me yet the kind
Soft hand of her who penned it

And see through twoscore years of smoke
In bygone quaint apparel
Shine from yon timeblack Norway oak
The face of Patience Caryl

The pale smooth forehead silvertressed
The gray gown primly flowered
The spotless stately coif whose crest
Like Hectors horseplume towered

And still the sweet halfsolemn look
Where some past thought was clinging
As when one shuts a serious book
To hear the thrushes singing

I kneel to you Of those you were
Whose kind old hearts grow mellow
Whose fair old faces grow more fair
As Point and Flanders yellow

Whom some old store of garnered grief
Their placid temples shading
Crowns like a wreath of autumn leaf
With tender tints of fading

Peace to your soul You died unwed
Despite this loving letter
And what of John The less thats said
Of John I think the better

Austin Dobson 18401921




THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN

The wanton troopers riding by
Have shot my fawn and it will die
Ungentle men They cannot thrive
Who killed thee Thou neer didst alive
Them any harm alas nor could
Thy death to them do any good
Im sure I never wished them ill
Nor do I for all this nor will
But if my simple prayers may yet
Prevail with Heaven to forget
Thy murder I will join my tears
Rather than fail But O my fears
It cannot die so Heavens King
Keeps register of everything
And nothing may we use in vain
Even beasts must be with justice slain
Else men are made their deodands
Though they should wash their guilty hands
In this warm lifeblood which doth part
From thine and wound me to the heart
Yet could they not be clean their stain
Is dyed in such a purple grain
There is not such another in
The world to offer for their sin

Inconstant Sylvio when yet
I had not found him counterfeit
One morning I remember well
Tied in this silver chain and bell
Gave it to me nay and I know
What he said thenIm sure I do
Said he Look how your huntsman here
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his deer
But Sylvio soon had me beguiled
This waxed tame while he grew wild
And quite regardless of my smart
Left me his fawn but took his heart

Thenceforth I set myself to play
My solitary time away
With this and very well content
Could so mine idle life have spent
For it was full of sport and light
Of foot and heart and did invite
Me to its game it seemed to bless
Itself in me How could I less
Than love it Oh I cannot be
Unkind to a beast that loveth me

Had it lived long I do not know
Whether it too might have done so
As Sylvio did his gifts might be
Perhaps as false or more than he
But I am sure for aught that I
Could in so short a time espy
Thy love was far more better than
The love of false and cruel man

With sweetest milk and sugar first
I it at mine own fingers nursed
And as it grew so every day
It waxed more white and sweet than they
It had so sweet a breath and oft
I blushed to see its foot more soft
And white shall I say than my hand
Nay any ladys of the land

It was a wondrous thing how fleet
Twas on those little silver feet
With what a pretty skipping grace
It oft would challenge me the race
And whent had left me far away
Twould stay and run again and stay
For it was nimbler much than hinds
And trod as if on the four winds

I have a garden of my own
But so with roses overgrown
And lilies that you would it guess
To be a little wilderness
And all the springtime of the year
It loved only to be there
Among the beds of lilies I
Have sought it oft where it should lie
Yet could not till itself would rise
Find it although before mine eyes
For in the flaxen lilies shade
It like a bank of lilies laid
Upon the roses it would feed
Until its lips een seemed to bleed
And then to me twould boldly trip
And print those roses on my lip
But all its chief delight was still
On roses thus itself to fill
And its pure virgin lips to fold
In whitest sheets of lilies cold
Had it lived long it would have been
Lilies without roses within

O help O help I see it faint
And die as calmly as a saint
See how it weeps the tears do come
Sad slowly dropping like a gum
So weeps the wounded balsam so
The holy frankincense doth flow
The brotherless Heliades
Melt in such amber tears as these

I in a golden vial will
Keep these two crystal tears and fill
It till it doth overflow with mine
Then place it in Dianas shrine

Now my sweet fawn is vanished to
Whither the swans and turtles go
In fair Elysium to endure
With milkwhite lambs and ermines pure
O do not run too fast for I
Will but bespeak thy grave and die

First my unhappy statue shall
Be cut in marble and withal
Let it be weeping too but there
The engraver sure his art may spare
For I so truly thee bemoan
That I shall weep though I be stone
Until my tears still dropping wear
My breast themselves engraving there
Then at my feet shalt thou be laid
Of purest alabaster made
For I would have thine image be
White as I can though not as thee

Andrew Marvell 16211678




ON THE DEATH OF A FAVORITE CAT DROWNED IN A TUB OF GOLD FISHES

Twas on a lofty vases side
Where Chinas gayest art had dyed
The azure flowers that blow
Demurest of the tabby kind
The pensive Selima reclined
Gazed on the lake below

Her conscious tail her joy declared
The fair round face the snowy beard
The velvet of her paws
Her coat that with the tortoise vies
Her ears of jet and emerald eyes
She saw and purred applause

Still had she gazed but midst the tide
Two angel forms were seen to glide
The Genii of the stream
Their scaly armors Tyrian hue
Through richest purple to the view
Betrayed a golden gleam

The hapless Nymph with wonder saw
A whisker first and then a claw
With many an ardent wish
She stretched in vain to reach the prize
What female heart can gold despise
What Cats averse to fish

Presumptous Maid with looks intent
Again she stretched again she bent
Nor knew the gulf between
Malignant Fate sat by and smiled
The slippery verge her feet beguiled
She tumbled headlong in

Eight times emerging from the flood
She mewed to every watery god
Some speedy aid to send
No Dolphin came no Nereid stirred
Nor cruel Tom nor Susan heard
A Favorite has no friend

From hence ye Beauties undeceived
Know one false step is neer retrieved
And be with caution bold
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes
And heedless hearts is lawful prize
Nor all that glisters gold

Thomas Gray 17161771




VERSES ON A CAT

Clubby thou surely art I ween
A Puss of most majestic mien
So stately all thy paces
With such a philosophic air
Thou seekst thy professorial chair
And so demure thy face is

And as thou sitst thine eye seems fraught
With such intensity of thought
That could we read it knowledge
Would seem to breathe in every mew
And learning yet undreamt by you
Who dwell in Hall or College

Oh when in solemn taciturnity
Thy brain seems wandering through eternity
What happiness were mine
Could I then catch the thoughts that flow
Thoughts such as neer were hatched below
But in a head like thine

Oh then throughout the livelong day
With thee Id sit and purr away
In ecstasy sublime
And in thy face as from a book
Id drink in science at each look
Nor fear the lapse of time

Charles Daubeny 17451827




EPITAPH ON A HARE

Here lies whom hound did neer pursue
Nor swifter greyhound follow
Whose foot neer tainted morning dew
Nor ear heard huntsmans hallo

Old Tiney surliest of his kind
Who nursed with tender care
And to domestic bounds confined
Was still a wild Jackhare

Though duly from my hand he took
His pittance every night
He did it with a jealous look
And when he could would bite

His diet was of wheaten bread
And milk and oats and straw
Thistles or lettuces instead
With sand to scour his maw

On twigs of hawthorn he regaled
On pippins russet peel
And when his juicy salads failed
Sliced carrot pleased him well

A Turkey carpet was his lawn
Whereon he loved to bound
To skip and gambol like a fawn
And swing his rump around

His frisking was at evening hours
For then he lost his fear
But most before approaching showers
Or when a storm drew near

Eight years and five roundrolling moons
He thus saw steal away
Dozing out all his idle noons
And every night at play

I kept him for his humors sake
For he would oft beguile
My heart of thoughts that made it ache
And force me to a smile

But now beneath this walnutshade
He finds his long last home
And waits in snug concealment laid
Till gentler Puss shall come

He still more aged feels the shocks
From which no care can save
And partner once of Tineys box
Must soon partake his grave

William Cowper 17311800




ON THE DEATH OF MRS THROCKMORTONS BULLFINCH

Ye Nymphs if eer your eyes were red
With tears oer hapless favorites shed
O share Marias grief
Her favorite even in his cage
What will not hungers cruel rage
Assassined by a thief

Where Rhenus strays his vines among
The egg was laid from which he sprung
And though by nature mute
Or only with a whistle blessed
Welltaught he all the sounds expressed
Of flageolet or flute

The honors of his ebon poll
Were brighter than the sleekest mole
His bosom of the hue
With which Aurora decks the skies
When piping winds shall soon arise
To sweep away the dew

Above below in all the house
Dire foe alike of bird and mouse
No cat had leave to dwell
And Bullys cage supported stood
On props of smoothestshaven wood
Largebuilt and latticed well

Welllatticedbut the grate alas
Not rough with wire of steel or brass
For Bullys plumage sake
But smooth with wands from Ouses side
With which when neatly peeled and dried
The swains their baskets make

Night veiled the poleall seemed secure
When led by instinct sharp and sure
Subsistence to provide
A beast forth sallied on the scout
Longbacked longtailed with whiskered snout
And badgercolored hide

He entering at the studydoor
Its ample area gan explore
And something in the wind
Conjectured sniffing round and round
Better than all the books he found
Food chiefly for the mind

Just then by adverse fate impressed
A dream disturbed poor Bullys rest
In sleep he seemed to view
A rat fastclinging to the cage
And screaming at the sad presage
Awoke and found it true

For aided both by ear and scent
Right to his mark the monster went
Ah Muse forbear to speak
Minute the horror that ensued
His teeth were strong the cage was wood
He left poor Bullys beak

O had he made that too his prey
That beak whence issued many a lay
Of such mellifluous tone
Might have repaid him well I wote
For silencing so sweet a throat
Fast stuck within his own

Maria weepsthe Muses mourn
So when by Bacchanalians torn
On Thracian Hebrus side
The treeenchanter Orpheus fell
His head alone remained to tell
The cruel death he died

William Cowper 17311800




AN ELEGY ON A LAPDOG

Shocks fate I mourn poor Shock is now no more
Ye Muses mourn ye Chambermaids deplore
Unhappy Shock Yet more unhappy fair
Doomed to survive thy joy and only care
Thy wretched fingers now no more shall deck
And tie the favorite ribbon round his neck
No more thy hand shall smooth his glossy hair
And comb the wavings of his pendent ear
Let cease thy flowing grief forsaken maid
All mortal pleasures in a moment fade
Our surest hope is in an hour destroyed
And love best gift of Heaven not long enjoyed
Methinks I see her frantic with despair
Her streaming eyes wrung hands and flowing hair
Her Mechlin pinners rent the floor bestrow
And her torn fan gives real signs of woe
Hence Superstition that tormenting guest
That haunts with fancied fears the coward breast
No dread events upon this fate attend
Stream eyes no more no more thy tresses rend
Though certain omens oft forewarn a state
And dying lions show the monarchs fate
Why should such fears bid Celias sorrow rise
For when a lapdog falls no lover dies
Cease Celia cease restrain thy flowing tears
Some warmer passion will dispel thy cares
In man youll find a more substantial bliss
More grateful toying and a sweeter kiss
Hes dead Oh lay him gently in the ground
And may his tomb be by this verse renowned
Here Shock the pride of all his kind is laid
Who fawned like man but neer like man betrayed

John Gay 16851732




MY LAST TERRIER

I mourn Patroclus whilst I praise
Young Peter sleek before the fire
A proper dog whose decent ways
Renew the virtues of his sire
Patroclus rests in grassy tomb
And Peter grows into his room

For though when Time or Fates consign
The terrier to his latest earth
Vowing no wastrel of the line
Shall dim the memory of his worth
I meditate the silkier breeds
Yet still an Amurath succeeds

Succeeds to bind the heart again
To watchful eye and strenuous paw
To tail that gratulates amain
Or deprecates offended Law
To bind and break when failing eye
And palsied paw must say goodbye

Ah had the dogs appointed day
But tallied with his masters span
Nor one swift decade turned to gray
The busy muzzles black and tan
To reprobate in idle men
Their threescore empty years and ten

Sure somewhere oer the Stygian strait
Panurge and Bito Tramp and Mike
In couchant conclave watch the gate
Till comes the last successive tyke
Acknowledged with the countersign
Your master was a friend of mine

In dreams I see them spring to greet
With rapture more than tail can tell
Their master of the silent feet
Who whistles oer the asphodel
And through the dim Elysian bounds
Leads all his cry of little hounds

John Halsham 18




GEISTS GRAVE

Four yearsand didst thou stay above
The ground which hides thee now but four
And all that life and all that love
Were crowded Geist into no more

Only four years those winning ways
Which make me for thy presence yearn
Called us to pet thee or to praise
Dear little friend at every turn

That loving heart that patient soul
Had they indeed no longer span
To run their course and reach their goal
And read their homily to man

That liquid melancholy eye
From whose pathetic soulfed springs
Seemed surging the Virgilian cry
The sense of tears in mortal things

That steadfast mournful strain consoled
By spirits gloriously gay
And temper of heroic mould
What was four years their whole short day

Yes only fourand not the course
Of all the centuries yet to come
And not the infinite resource
Of Nature with her countless sum

Of figures with her fulness vast
Of new creation evermore
Can ever quite repeat the past
Or just thy little self restore

Stern law of every mortal lot
Which man proud man finds hard to bear
And builds himself I know not what
Of second life I know not where

But thou when struck thine hour to go
On us who stood despondent by
A meek last glance of love didst throw
And humbly lay thee down to die

Yet would we keep thee in our heart
Would fix our favorite on the scene
Nor let thee utterly depart
And be as if thou neer hadst been

And so there rise these lines of verse
On lips that rarely form them now
While to each other we rehearse
Such ways such arts such looks hadst thou

We stroke thy broad brown paws again
We bid thee to thy vacant chair
We greet thee by the windowpane
We hear thy scuffle on the stair

We see the flaps of thy large ears
Quick raised to ask which way we go
Crossing the frozen lake appears
Thy small black figure on the snow

Nor to us only art thou dear
Who mourn thee in thine English home
Thou hast thine absent masters tear
Dropped by the far Australian foam

Thy memory lasts both here and there
And thou shalt live as long as we
And after thatthou dost not care
In us was all the world to thee

Yet fondly zealous for thy fame
Even to a date beyond our own
We strive to carry down thy name
By mounded turf and graven stone

We lay thee close within our reach
Here where the grass is smooth and warm
Between the holly and the beech
Where oft we watched thy couchant form

Asleep yet lending half an ear
To travelers on the Portsmouth road
There choose we thee O guardian dear
Marked with a stone thy last abode

Then some who through this garden pass
When we too like thyself are clay
Shall see thy grave upon the grass
And stop before the stone and say

People who lived here long ago
Did by this stone it seems intend
To name for future times to know
The dachshound Geist their little friend

Matthew Arnold 18221888




HOLD

I know where Hampshire fronts the Wight
A little church where after strife
Reposes Guy de Blanquely Knight
By Alison his wife
I know their features graven lines
In timestained marble monotone
While crouched before their feet reclines
Their little dog of stone

I look where Blanquely Castle still
Frowns oer the oak woods summer state
The maker of a patent pill
Has purchased it of late
And then through Fancys open door
I backward turn to days of old
And see Sir Guya bachelor
Who owns a dog called Hold

I see him take the tourneys chance
And urge his coalblack charger on
To an arbitrament by lance
For lovely Alison
I mark the onset see him hurl
From broidered saddle to the dirt
His rival that ignoble Earl
Blackhearted Massingbert

Then Alison with downdropped eyes
Where happy tears bedim the blue
Bestows a valuable prize
And adds her hand thereto
My lord his surcoat streaked with sand
Remounts low muttering curses hot
And with a baseborn hireling band
He plans a dastard plot



Tis nightSir Guy has sunk to sleep
The castle keep is hushed and still
See up the spiral stairway creep
To work his wicked will
Lord Massingbert of odious fame
Soft followed by his cutthroat staff
Ah Hold has justified his name
And pinned his lordships calf

A growl an oath then torches flare
Out rings a sentrys startled shout
The guard are racing for the stair
Halfdressed Sir Guy runs out
On high his glittering blade he waves
He gives foul Massingbert the point
He carves the hired assassin knaves
Joint from plebeian joint



The Knight is deadhis sword is rust
But in his day Im certain Hold
Wore as his masters badge of trust
A collarette of gold
And still I like to fancy that
Somewhere beyond the Styxs bound
Sir Guys tall phantom stoops to pat
His little phantom hound

Patrick R Chalmers 18










THE BARB OF SATIRE










THE VICAR OF BRAY

In good King Charless golden days
When loyalty no harm meant
A zealous highchurchman was I
And so I got preferment
To teach my flock I never missed
Kings were by God appointed
And lost are those that dare resist
Or touch the Lords anointed
And this is law that Ill maintain
Until my dying day sir
That whatsoever king shall reign
Still Ill be the Vicar of Bray sir

When royal James possessed the crown
And popery grew in fashion
The penal laws I hooted down
And read the Declaration
The Church of Rome I found would fit
Full well my constitution
And I had been a Jesuit
But for the Revolution

When William was our king declared
To ease the nations grievance
With this new wind about I steered
And swore to him allegiance
Old principles I did revoke
Set conscience at a distance
Passive obedience was a joke
A jest was nonresistance

When royal Anne became our queen
The Church of Englands glory
Another face of things was seen
And I became a Tory
Occasional conformists base
I blamed their moderation
And thought the Church in danger was
By such prevarication

When George in puddingtime came oer
And moderate men looked big sir
My principles I changed once more
And so became a Whig sir
And thus preferment I procured
From our new Faiths defender
And almost every day abjured
The Pope and the Pretender

The illustrious house of Hanover
And Protestant succession
To these I do allegiance swear
While they can keep possession
For in my faith and loyalty
I nevermore will falter
And George my lawful king shall be
Until the times do alter
And this is law that Ill maintain
Until my dying day sir
That whatsoever king shall reign
Still Ill be the Vicar of Bray sir

THE LOST LEADER
William Wordsworth

Just for a handful of silver he left us
Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat
Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us
Lost all the others she lets us devote
They with the gold to give doled him out silver
So much was theirs who so little allowed
How all our copper had gone for his service
Ragswere they purple his heart had been proud
We that had loved him so followed him honored him
Lived in his mild and magnificent eye
Learned his great language caught his clear accents
Made him our pattern to live and to die
Shakespeare was of us Milton was for us
Burns Shelley were with usthey watch from their graves
He alone breaks from the van and the freemen
He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves
We shall march prosperingnot through his presence
Songs may inspirit usnot from his lyre
Deeds will be donewhile he boasts his quiescence
Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire
Blot out his name then record one lost soul more
One task more declined one more footpath untrod
One more devilstriumph and sorrow for angels
One wrong more to man one more insult to God
Lifes night begins let him never come back to us
There would be doubt hesitation and pain
Forced praise on our partthe glimmer of twilight
Never glad confident morning again
Best fight on well for we taught himstrike gallantly
Menace our heart ere we master his own
Then let him receive the new knowledge and wait us
Pardoned in heaven the first by the throne

Robert Browning 18121889




ICHABOD
Daniel Webster

So fallen so lost the light withdrawn
Which once he wore
The glory from his gray hairs gone
Forevermore

Revile him not the Tempter hath
A snare for all
And pitying tears not scorn and wrath
Befit his fall

Oh dumb be passions stormy rage
When he who might
Have lighted up and led his age
Falls back in night

Scorn would the angels laugh to mark
A bright soul driven
Fiendgoaded down the endless dark
From hope and heaven

Let not the land once proud of him
Insult him now
Nor brand with deeper shame his dim
Dishonored brow

But let its humbled sons instead
From sea to lake
A long lament as for the dead
In sadness make

Of all we loved and honored naught
Save power remains
A fallen angels pride of thought
Still strong in chains

All else is gone from those great eyes
The soul has fled
When faith is lost when honor dies
The man is dead

Then pay the reverence of old days
To his dead fame
Walk backward with averted gaze
And hide the shame

John Greenleaf Whittier 18071892

THE MARQUIS OF CARABAS
A Song With A Stolen Burden

Off with your hat along the street
His Lordships carriage rolls
Respect to greatnesswhen it shines
To cheer our darkened souls
Get off the step you ragged boys
Policeman wheres your staff
This is a sight to check with awe
The most irreverent laugh
Chapeau bas
Chapeau bas
Gloire au Marquis de Carabas

Stand further back well see him well
Wait till they lift him out
It takes some time his Lordships old
And suffers from the gout
Now look he owns a castled park
For every finger thin
He has more sterling pounds a day
Than wrinkles in his skin

The founder of his race was son
To a kings cousin rich
The mother was an oyster wench
She perished in a ditch
His patriot worth embalmed has been
In poets loud applause
He made twelve thousand pounds a year
By aiding Frances cause

The second marquis of the stole
Was groom to the second James
He all but caught that recreant king
When flying oer the Thames
Devotion rare by Orange Will
With a Scotch county paid
He gained one morein Irelandwhen
Charles Edward he betrayed

He lived to see his son grow up
A general famed and bold
Who fought his countrys fightsand one
For half a million sold
His son alas the houses shame
Frittered the name away
Diced wenched and drankat last got shot
Through cheating in his play

Now see where focused on one head
The races glories shine
The head gets narrow at the top
But mark the jawhow fine
Dont call it satyrlike youd wound
Some scores whose honest pates
The selfsame type present upon
The Carabas estates

Look at his skinat fourscore years
How fresh it gleams and fair
He never tasted illdressed food
Or breathed in tainted air
The noble blood glows through his veins
Still with a healthful pink
His brow scarce wrinkledBrows keep so
That have not got to think

His hand s unglovedit shakes tis true
But mark its tiny size
High births true sign and shape as on
The lackeys arm it lies
That hand neer penned a useful line
Neer worked a deed of fame
Save slaying one whose sister he
Its ownerbrought to shame

They ye got him inhes gone to vote
Your rights and mine away
Perchance our lives should men be scarce
To fight his cause for pay
We are his slaves he owns our lands
Our woods our seas and skies
Hed have us shot like vicious dogs
Should we in murmuring rise
Chapeau bas
Chapeau bas
Gloire au Marquis de Carabas

Robert Brough 18281860




A MODEST WIT

A supercilious nabob of the East
Haughty being greatpurseproud being rich
A governor or general at the least
I have forgotten which

Had in his family a humble youth
Who went from England in his patrons suit
An unassuming boy in truth
A lad of decent parts and good repute

This youth had sense and spirit
But yet with all his sense
Excessive diffidence
Obscured his merit

One day at table flushed with pride and wine
His Honor proudly free severely merry
Conceived it would be vastly fine
To crack a joke upon his secretary

Young man he said by what art craft or trade
Did your good father gain a livelihood
He was a saddler sir Modestus said
And in his time was reckoned good

A saddler eh and taught you Greek
Instead of teaching you to sew
Pray why did not your father make
A saddler sir of you

Each parasite then as in duty bound
The joke applauded and the laugh went round
At length Modestus bowing low
Said craving pardon if too free he made
Sir by your leave I fain would know
Your fathers trade

My fathers trade by heaven thats too bad
My fathers trade Why blockhead are you mad
My father sir did never stoop so low
He was a gentleman Id have you know

Excuse the liberty I take
Modestus said with archness on his brow
Pray why did not your father make
A gentleman of you

Selleck Osborn 17831826




JOLLY JACK

When fierce political debate
Throughout the isle was storming
And Rads attacked the throne and state
And Tories the reforming
To calm the furious rage of each
And right the land demented
Heaven sent us Jolly Jack to teach
The way to be contented

Jacks bed was straw twas warm and soft
His chair a threelegged stool
His broken jug was emptied oft
Yet somehow always full
His mistress portrait decked the wall
His mirror had a crack
Yet gay and glad though this was all
His wealth lived Jolly Jack

To give advice to avarice
Teach pride its mean condition
And preach good sense to dull pretence
Was honest Jacks high mission
Our simple statesman found his rule
Of moral in the flagon
And held his philosophic school
Beneath the George and Dragon

When village Solons cursed the Lords
And called the malttax sinful
Jack heeded not their angry words
But smiled and drank his skinful
And when men wasted health and life
In search of rank and riches
Jack marched aloof the paltry strife
And wore his threadbare breeches

I enter not the Church he said
But Ill not seek to rob it
So worthy Jack Joe Miller read
While others studied Cobbett
His talk it was of feast and fun
His guide the Almanack
From youth to age thus gaily run
The life of Jolly Jack

And when Jack prayed as oft he would
He humbly thanked his Maker
I am said he O Father good
Nor Catholic nor Quaker
Give each his creed let each proclaim
His catalogue of curses
I trust in Thee and not in them
In Thee and in Thy mercies

Forgive me if midst all Thy works
No hint I see of damning
And think theres faith among the Turks
And hope for een the Brahmin
Harmless my mind is and my mirth
And kindly is my laughter
I cannot see the smiling earth
And think theres hell hereafter

Jack died he left no legacy
Save that his story teaches
Content to peevish poverty
Humility to riches
Ye scornful great ye envious small
Come fellow in his track
We all were happier if we all
Would copy Jolly Jack

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863




THE KING OF BRENTFORD
After Beranger

There was a King in Brentfordof whom no legends tell
But who without his glorycould eat and sleep right well
His Pollys cotton nightcapit was his crown of state
He slept of evenings earlyand rose of mornings late

All in a fine mud palaceeach day he took four meals
And for a guard of honora dog ran at his heels
Sometimes to view his kingdomsrode forth this monarch good
And then a prancing jackasshe royally bestrode

There were no costly habitswith which this King was cursed
Except and wheres the harm onta somewhat lively thirst
But people must pay taxesand Kings must have their sport
So out of every gallonHis Grace he took a quart

He pleased the ladies round himwith manners soft and bland
With reason good they named himthe father of his land
Each year his mighty armiesmarched forth in gallant show
Their enemies were targetstheir bullets they were tow

He vexed no quiet neighborno useless conquest made
But by the laws of pleasurehis peaceful realm he swayed
And in the years he reignedthrough all this country wide
There was no cause for weepingsave when the good man died

The faithful men of Brentforddo still their King deplore
His portrait yet is swingingbeside an alehouse door
And topers tenderheartedregard his honest phiz
And envy times departedthat knew a reign like his

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863

NONGTONGPAW

John Bull for pastime took a prance
Some time ago to peep at France
To talk of sciences and arts
And knowledge gained in foreign parts
Monsieur obsequious heard him speak
And answered John in heathen Greek
To all he asked bout all he saw
Twas Monsieur je vous nentends pas

John to the PalaisRoyal come
Its splendor almost struck him dumb
I say whose house is that there here
House Je vous nentends pas Monsieur
What Nongtongpaw again cries John
This fellow is some mighty Don
No doubt hes plenty for the maw
Ill breakfast with this Nongtongpaw

John saw Versailles from Marlis height
And cried astonished at the sight
Whose fine estate is that there here
State Je vous nentends pas Monsieur
His what the land and houses too
The fellows richer than a Jew
On everything he lays his claw
I should like to dine with Nongtongpaw

Next tripping came a courtly fair
John cried enchanted with her air
What lovely wench is that there here
Ventch Je vous nentends pas Monsieur
What he again Upon my life
A palace lands and then a wife
Sir Joshua might delight to draw
I should like to sup with Nongtongpaw

But hold whose funerals that cries John
Je vous nentends pasWhat is he gone
Wealth fame and beauty could not save
Poor Nongtongpaw then from the grave
His race is run his game is up
Id with him breakfast dine and sup
But since he chooses to withdraw
Good night t ye Mounseer Nongtongpaw

Charles Dibdin 17451814




THE LION AND THE CUB

How fond are men of rule and place
Who court it from the mean and base
These cannot bear an equal nigh
But from superior merit fly
They love the cellars vulgar joke
And lose their hours in ale and smoke
There oer some petty club preside
So poor so paltry is their pride
Nay even with fools whole nights will sit
In hopes to be supreme in wit
If these can read to these I write
To set their worth in truest light

A Lioncub of sordid mind
Avoided all the lion kind
Fond of applause he sought the feasts
Of vulgar and ignoble beasts
With asses all his time he spent
Their clubs perpetual president
He caught their manners looks and airs
An ass in everything but ears
If eer his Highness meant a joke
They grinned applause before he spoke
But at each word what shouts of praise
Good gods how natural he brays
Elate with flattery and conceit
He seeks his royal sires retreat
Forward and fond to show his parts
His Highness brays the Lion starts
Puppy that cursed vociferation
Betrays thy life and conversation
Coxcombs an evernoisy race
Are trumpets of their own disgrace
Why so severe the Cub replies
Our senate always held me wise
How weak is pride returns the sire
All fools are vain when fools admire
But know what stupid asses prize
Lions and noble beasts despise

John Gay 16851732




THE HARE WITH MANY FRIENDS

Friendship like love is but a name
Unless to one you stint the flame
The child whom many fathers share
Hath seldom known a fathers care
Tis thus in friendship who depend
On many rarely find a friend
A Hare who in a civil way
Complied with everything like Gay
Was known by all the bestial train
Who haunt the wood or graze the plain
Her care was never to offend
And every creature was her friend
As forth she went at early dawn
To taste the dewbesprinkled lawn
Behind she hears the hunters cries
And from the deepmouthed thunder flies
She starts she stops she pants for breath
She hears the near advance of death
She doubles to mislead the hound
And measures back her mazy round
Till fainting in the public way
Half dead with fear she gasping lay
What transport in her bosom grew
When first the Horse appeared in view
Let me says she your back ascend
And owe my safety to a friend
You know my feet betray my flight
To friendship every burdens light
The Horse replied Poor honest Puss
It grieves my heart to see thee thus
Be comforted relief is near
For all your friends are in the rear
She next the stately Bull implored
And thus replied the mighty lord
Since every beast alive can tell
That I sincerely wish you well
I may without offence pretend
To take the freedom of a friend
Love calls me hence a favorite cow
Expects me near yon barleymow
And when a ladys in the case
You know all other things give place
To leave you thus might seem unkind
But see the Goat is just behind
The Goat remarked her pulse was high
Her languid head her heavy eye
My back says he may do you harm
The Sheeps at hand and wool is warm
The Sheep was feeble and complained
His sides a load of wool sustained
Said he was slow confessed his fears
For hounds eat sheep as well as Hares
She now the trotting Calf addressed
To save from death a friend distressed
Shall I says he of tender age
In this important care engage
Older and abler passed you by
How strong are those how weak am I
Should I presume to bear you hence
Those friends of mine may take offence
Excuse me then You know my heart
But dearest friends alas must part
How shall we all lament Adieu
For see the hounds are just in view

John Gay 16851732




THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX AND THE GULLIBLE RAVEN

A raven sat upon a tree
And not a word he spoke for
His beak contained a piece of Brie
Or maybe it was Roquefort
Well make it any kind you please
At all events it was a cheese

Beneath the trees umbrageous limb
A hungry fox sat smiling
He saw the raven watching him
And spoke in words beguiling
Jadmire said he ton beau plumage
The which was simply persiflage

Two things there are no doubt you know
To which a fox is used
A rooster that is bound to crow
A crow thats bound to roost
And whichsoever he espies
He tells the most unblushing lies

Sweet fowl he said I understand
Youre more than merely natty
I hear you sing to beat the band
And Adelina Patti
Pray render with your liquid tongue
A bit from Gotterdammerung

This subtle speech was aimed to please
The crow and it succeeded
He thought no bird in all the trees
Could sing as well as he did
In flattery completely doused
He gave the Jewel Song from Faust

But gravitations law of course
As Isaac Newton showed it
Exerted on the cheese its force
And elsewhere soon bestowed it
In fact there is no need to tell
What happened when to earth it fell

I blush to add that when the bird
Took in the situation
He said one brief emphatic word
Unfit for publication
The fox was greatly startled but
He only sighed and answered Tut

The moral is A fox is bound
To be a shameless sinner
And also When the cheese comes round
You know its after dinner
But what is only known to few
The fox is after dinner too

Guy Wetmore Carryl 18731904




THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE KNIFEGRINDER
Friend Of Humanity

Needy knifegrinder whither are you going
Rough is the road your wheel is out of order
Bleak blows the blastyour hat has got a hole int
So have your breeches

Weary knifegrinder little think the proud ones
Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike
Road what hard work tis crying all day
Knives and
Scissors to grind O

Tell me knifegrinder how you came to grind knives
Did some rich man tyrannically use you
Was it the squire or parson of the parish
Or the attorney

Was it the squire for killing of his game or
Covetous parson for his tithes destraining
Or roguish lawyer made you lose your little
All in a lawsuit

Have you not read the Rights of Man by Tom Paine
Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids
Ready to fall as soon as you have told your
Pitiful story

KNIFEGRINDER
Story God bless you I have none to tell sir
Only last night adrinking at the Chequers
This poor old hat and breeches as you see were
Torn in a scuffle

Constables came up for to take me into
Custody they took me before the justice
Justice Oldmixon put me in the parish
Stocks for a vagrant

I should be glad to drink your honors health in
A pot of beer if you will give me sixpence
But for my part I never love to meddle
With politics sir

FRIEND OF HUMANITY
I give thee sixpence I will see thee damned first
Wretch whom no sense of wrongs can rouse to vengeance
Sordid unfeeling reprobate degraded
Spiritless outcast

Kicks the Knifegrinder overturns his wheel and exit in a transport of republican enthusiasm and universal philanthropy

George Canning 17701827




VILLONS STRAIGHT TIP TO ALL CROSS COVES
Tout aux tavernes et aux fiells

Suppose you screeve or go cheapjack
Or fake the broads or fig a nag
Or thimblerig or knap a yack
Or pitch a snide or smash a rag
Suppose you duff or nose and lag
Or get the straight and land your pot
How do you melt the multy swag
Booze and the blowens cop the lot

Fiddle or fence or mace or mack
Or moskeneer or flash the drag
Deadlurk a crib or do a crack
Pad with a slang or chuck a fag
Bonnet or tout or mump and gag
Rattle the tats or mark the spot
You can not bag a single stag
Booze and the blowens cop the lot

Suppose you try a different tack
And on the square you flash your flag
At pennyalining make your whack
Or with the mummers mug and gag
For nix for nix the dibbs you bag
At any graft no matter what
Your merry goblins soon stravag
Booze and the blowens cop the lot

THE MORAL
Its up the spout and Charley Wag
With wipes and tickers and what not
Until the squeezer nips your scrag
Booze and the blowens cop the lot

William Ernest Henley 18491903




VILLONS BALLADE
Of Good Counsel To His Friends Of Evil Life

Nay be you pardoner or cheat
Or cogger keen or mumper shy
Youll burn your fingers at the feat
And howl like other folks that fry
All evil folks that love a lie
And where goes gain that greed amasses
By wile and guile and thievery
Tis all to taverns and to lasses

Rhyme rail dance play the cymbals sweet
With game and shame and jollity
Go jigging through the field and street
With mystry and morality
Win gold at gleekand that will fly
Where all your gain at passage passes
And thats You know as well as I
Tis all to taverns and to lasses

Nay forth from all such filth retreat
Go delve and ditch in wet or dry
Turn groom give horse and mule their meat
If youve no clerkly skill to ply
Youll gain enough with husbandry
Butsow hempseed and such wild grasses
And where goes all you take thereby
Tis all to taverns and to lasses

ENVOY
Your clothes your hose your broidery
Your linen that the snow surpasses
Or ere theyre worn off off they fly
Tis all to taverns and to lasses

Andrew Lang 18441912




A LITTLE BROTHER OF THE RICH

To put new shingles on old roofs
To give old women wadded skirts
To treat premonitory coughs
With seasonable flannel shirts
To soothe the stings of poverty
And keep the jackal from the door
These are the works that occupy
The Little Sister of the Poor

She carries everywhere she goes
Kind words and chickens jams and coals
Poultices for corporeal woes
And sympathy for downcast souls
Her currant jelly her quinine
The lips of fever move to bless
She makes the humble sickroom shine
With unaccustomed tidiness

A heart of hers the instant twin
And vivid counterpart is mine
I also serve my fellowmen
Though in a somewhat different line
The Poor and their concerns she has
Monopolized because of which
It falls to me to labor as
A Little Brother of the Rich

For their sake at no sacrifice
Does my devoted spirit quail
I give their horses exercise
As ballast on their yachts I sail
Upon their tallyhos I ride
And brave the chances of a storm
I even use my own inside
To keep their wines and victuals warm

Those whom we strive to benefit
Dear to our hearts soon grow to be
I love my Rich and I admit
That they are very good to me
Succor the Poor my sistersI
While heaven shall still vouchsafe me health
Will strive to share and mollify
The trials of abounding wealth

Edward Sandford Martin 1856




THE WORLDS WAY

At Harouns court it chanced upon a time
An Arab poet made this pleasant rhyme

The new moon is a horseshoe wrought of God
Wherewith the Sultans stallion shall be shod

On hearing this the Sultan smiled and gave
The man a goldpiece Sing again O slave

Above his lute the happy singer bent
And turned another gracious compliment

And as before the smiling Sultan gave
The man a sekkah Sing again O slave

Again the verse came fluent as a rill
That wanders silverfooted down a hill

The Sultan listening nodded as before
Still gave the gold and still demanded more

The nimble fancy that had climbed so high
Grew weary with its climbing by and by

Strange discords rose the sense went quite amiss
The singers rhymes refused to meet and kiss

Invention flagged the lute had got unstrung
And twice he sang the song already sung

The Sultan furious called a mute and said
O Musta straightway whip me off his head

Poets not in Arabia alone
You get beheaded when your skill is gone

Thomas Bailey Aldrich 18371907




FOR MY OWN MONUMENT

As doctors give physic by way of prevention
Mat alive and in health of his tombstone took care
For delays are unsafe and his pious intention
May haply be never fulfilled by his heir

Then take Mats word for it the sculptor is paid
That the figure is fine pray believe your own eye
Yet credit but lightly what more may be said
For we flatter ourselves and teach marble to lie

Yet counting as far as to fifty his years
His virtues and vices were as other mens are
High hopes he conceived and he smothered great fears
In a life particolored half pleasure half care

Nor to business a drudge nor to faction a slave
He strove to make interest and freedom agree
In public employments industrious and grave
And alone with his friends lord how merry was he

Now in equipage stately now humbly on foot
Both fortunes be tried but to neither would trust
And whirled in the round as the wheel turned about
He found riches had wings and knew man was but dust

This verse little polished though mighty sincere
Sets neither his titles nor merit to view
It says that his relics collected lie here
And no mortal yet knows too if this may be true

Fierce robbers there are that infest the highway
So Mat may be killed and his bones never found
False witness at court and fierce tempests at sea
So Mat may yet chance to be hanged or be drowned

If his bones lie in earth roll in sea fly in air
To Fate we must yield and the thing is the same
And if passing thou givst him a smile or a tear
He cares notyet prithee be kind to his fame

Matthew Prior 16641721




THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT SAINT PRAXEDS CHURCH

Vanity saith the preacher vanity
Draw round my bed is Anselm keeping back
Nephewssons mine ah God I know not Well
She men would have to be your mother once
Old Gandolf envied me so fair she was
Whats done is done and she is dead beside
Dead long ago and I am Bishop since
And as she died so must we die ourselves
And thence ye may perceive the worlds a dream
Life how and what is it As here I lie
In this statechamber dying by degrees
Hours and long hours in the dead night I ask
Do I live am I dead Peace peace seems all
Saint Praxeds ever was the church for peace
And so about this tomb of mine I fought
With tooth and nail to save my niche ye know
Old Gandolf cozened me despite my care
Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South
He graced his carrion with God curse the same
Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence
One sees the pulpit o the epistleside
And somewhat of the choir those silent seats
And up into the aery dome where live
The angels and a sunbeams sure to lurk
And I shall fill my slab of basalt there
And neath my tabernacle take my rest
With those nine columns round me two and two
The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands
Peachblossom marble all the rare the ripe
As freshpoured red wine of a mighty pulse
Old Gandolf with his paltry onionstone
Put me where I may look at him True peach
Rosy and flawless how I earned the prize
Draw close that conflagration of my church
What then So much was saved if aught were missed
My sons ye would not be my death Go dig
The whitegrape vineyard where the oilpress stood
Drop water gently till the surface sink
And if yefind Ah God I know not I
Bedded in store of rotten figleaves soft
And corded up in a tight olivefrail
Some lump ah God of lapis lazuli
Big as a Jews head cut off at the nape
Blue as a vein oer the Madonnas breast
Sons all have I bequeathed you villas all
That brave Frascati villa with its bath
So let the blue lump poise between my knees
Like God the Fathers globe on both his hands
Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay
For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst
Swift as a weavers shuttle fleet our years
Man goeth to the grave and where is he
Did I say basalt for my slab sons Black
T was ever antiqueblack I meant How else
Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath
The basrelief in bronze ye promised me
Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of and perchance
Some tripod thyrsus with a vase or so
The Saviour at his sermon on the mount
Saint Praxed in a glory and one Pan
Ready to twitch the Nymphs last garment off
And Moses with the tables but I know
Ye mark me not What do they whisper thee
Child of my bowels Anselm Ah ye hope
To revel down my villas while I gasp
Bricked oer with beggars mouldy travertine
Which Gandolf from his tombtop chuckles at
Nay boys ye love meall of jasper then
T is jasper ye stand pledged to lest I grieve
My bath must needs be left behind alas
One block pure green as a pistachionut
Theres plenty jasper somewhere in the world
And have I not Saint Praxeds ear to pray
Horses for ye and brown Greek manuscripts
And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs
Thats if ye carve my epitaph aright
Choice Latin picked phrase Tullys every word
No gaudy ware like Gandolfs second line
Tully my masters Ulpian serves his need
And then how I shall lie through centuries
And hear the blessed mutter of the mass
And see God made and eaten all day long
And feel the steady candleflame and taste
Good strong thick stupefying incensesmoke
For as I lie here hours of the dead night
Dying in state and by such slow degrees
I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook
And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point
And let the bedclothes for a mortcloth drop
Into great laps and folds of sculptorswork
And as yon tapers dwindle and strange thoughts
Grow with a certain humming in my ears
About the life before I lived this life
And this life too popes cardinals and priests
Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount
Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes
And newfound agate urns as fresh as day
And marbles language Latin pure discreet
Aha ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend
No Tully said I Ulpian at the best
Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage
All lapis all sons Else I give the Pope
My villas Will ye ever eat my heart
Ever your eyes were as a lizards quick
They glitter like your mothers for my soul
Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze
Piece out its starved design and fill my vase
With grapes and add a visor and a Term
And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx
That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down
To comfort me on my entablature
Whereon I am to lie till I must ask
Do I live am I dead There leave me there
For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude
To deathye wish itGod ye wish it Stone
Gritstone acrumble Clammy squares which sweat
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through
And no more lapis to delight the world
Well go I bless ye Fewer tapers there
But in a row and going turn your backs
Ay like departing altarministrants
And leave me in my church the church for peace
That I may watch at leisure if he leers
Old Gandolfat me from his onionstone
As still he envied me so fair she was

Robert Browning 18121889




UP AT A VILLADOWN IN THE CITY
As Distinguished By An Italian Person Of Quality

Had I but plenty of money money enough and to spare
The house for me no doubt were a house in the citysquare
Ah such a life such a life as one leads at the window there
Something to see by Bacchus something to hear at least
There the whole day long ones life is a perfect feast
While up at a villa one lives I maintain it no more than a beast

Well now look at our villa stuck like the horn of a bull
Just on a mountainedge as bare as the creatures skull
Save a mere shag of a bush with hardly a leaf to pull
I scratch my own sometimes to see if the hairs turned wool

But the city oh the citythe square with the houses Why
They are stonefaced white as a curd theres something to take the eye
Houses in four straight lines not a single front awry
You watch who crosses and gossips who saunters who hurries by
Green blinds as a matter of course to draw when the sun gets high
And the shops with fanciful signs which are painted properly

What of a villa Though winter be over in March by rights
Tis May perhaps ere the snow shall have withered well off the heights
Youve the brown ploughed land before where the oxen steam and wheeze
And the hills oversmoked behind by the faint gray olive trees

Is it better in May I ask you Youve summer all at once
In a day he leaps complete with a few strong April suns
Mid the sharp short emerald wheat scarce risen three fingers well
The wild tulip at end of its tube blows out its great red bell
Like a thin clear bubble of blood for the children to pick and sell

Is it ever hot in the square Theres a fountain to spout and splash
In the shade it sings and springs in the shine such foambows flash
On the horses with curling fishtails that prance and paddle and pash
Round the lady atop in the conchfifty gazers do not abash
Though all that she wears is some weeds round her waist in a sort of sash

All the year round at the villa nothings to see though you linger
Except yon cypress that points like Deaths lean lifted fore finger
Some think fireflies pretty when they mix in the corn and mingle
Or thrid the stinking hemp till the stalks of it seem atingle
Late August or early September the stunning cicala is shrill
And the bees keep their tiresome whine round the resinous firs
 on the hill
Enough of the seasonsI spare you the months of the fever and chill

Ere you open your eyes in the city the blessed churchbells begin
No sooner the bells leave off than the diligence rattles in
You get the pick of the news and it costs you never a pin
By and by theres the travelling doctor gives pills lets blood
 draws teeth
Or the Pulcinellotrumpet breaks up the market beneath
At the postoffice such a scenepicturethe new play piping hot
And a notice how only this morning three liberal thieves were shot
Above it behold the Archbishops most fatherly of rebukes
And beneath with his crown and his lion some little new law
 of the Dukes
Or a sonnet with flowery marge to the Reverend Don Soandso
Who is Dante Boccaccio Petrarca St Jerome and Cicero
And moreover the sonnet goes rhyming the skirts of
 St Paul has reached
Having preached us those six Lentlectures more unctuous than
 ever he preached
Noon strikeshere sweeps the procession our Lady borne
 smiling and smart
With a pink gauze gown all spangles and seven swords stuck in her heart
Bangwhangwhang goes the drum tootlektootle the fife
No keeping ones haunches still its the greatest pleasure in life

But bless you its dearits dear fowls wine at double the rate
They have clapped a new tax upon salt and what oil pays passing the gate
Its a horror to think of And so the villa for me not the city
Beggars can scarcely be choosers but stillah the pity the pity
Look two and two go the priests then the monks with cowls and sandals
And the penitents dressed in white skirts aholding the yellow candles
One he carries a flag up straight and another a cross with handles
And the Dukes guard brings up the rear for the better prevention
 of scandals
Bangwhangwhang goes the drum tootletetootle the fife
Oh a day in the citysquare there is no such pleasure in life

Robert Browning 18121889




ALL SAINTS

In a church which is furnished with mullion and gable
With altar and reredos with gargoyle and groin
The penitents dresses are sealskin and sable
The odor of sanctitys eaudecologne

But only could Lucifer flying from Hades
Gaze down on this crowd with its paniers and paints
He would say as he looked at the lords and the ladies
Oh where is All Sinners if this is All Saints

Edmund Yates 18311894




AN ADDRESS TO THE UNCO GUID OR THE RIGIDLY RIGHTEOUS

My son these maxims make a rule
And lump them aye thegither
The Rigid Righteous is a fool
The Rigid Wise anither
The cleanest corn that eer was dight
May hae some pyles o caff in
Sae neer a fellowcreature slight
For random fits o daffin
 SolomonEccles vii 16

Oh ye wha are sae guid yoursel
Sae pious and sae holy
Yeve naught to do but mark and tell
Your neebors fauts and folly
Whase life is like a weelgaun mill
Supplied wi store o water
The heaped happers ebbing still
And still the clap plays clatter

Hear me ye venerable core
As counsel for poor mortals
That frequent pass douce Wisdoms door
For glaikit Follys portals
I for their thoughtless careless sakes
Would here propone defences
Their donsie tricks their black mistakes
Their failings and mischances

Ye see your state wi theirs compared
And shudder at the niffer
But cast a moments fair regard
What maks the mighty differ
Discount what scant occasion gave
That purity ye pride in
And whats aft mair than a the lave
Your better art o hidin

Think when your castigated pulse
Gies now and then a wallop
What ragings must his veins convulse
That still eternal gallop
Wi wind and tide fair i your tail
Right on ye scud your seaway
But in the teeth o baith to sail
It makes an unco leeway

See Social Life and Glee sit down
All joyous and unthinking
Till quite transmugrified theyve grown
Debauchery and Drinking
Oh would they stay to calculate
The eternal consequences
Or your more dreaded hell to state
Damnation of expenses

Ye high exalted virtuous dames
Tied up in godly laces
Before ye gie poor Frailty names
Suppose a change o cases
A dearloved lad convenience snug
A treacherous inclination
But let me whisper i your lug
Yere aiblins nae temptation

Then gently scan your brother man
Still gentler sister woman
Though they may gang a kennin wrang
To step aside is human
One point must still be greatly dark
The moving why they do it
And just as lamely can ye mark
How far perhaps they rue it

Who made the heart tis He alone
Decidedly can try us
He knows each chordits various tone
Each springits various bias
Then at the balance lets be mute
We never can adjust it
Whats done we partly may compute
But know not whats resisted

Robert Burns 17591796




THE DEACONS MASTERPIECE OR THE WONDERFUL ONEHOSS SHAY
A Logical Story

Have you heard of the wonderful onehoss shay
That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day
And then of a sudden itah but stay
Ill tell you what happened without delay
Scaring the parson into fits
Frightening people out of their wits
Have you ever heard of that I say

Seventeen hundred and fiftyfive
Georgius Secundus was then alive
Snuffy old drone from the German hive
That was the year when Lisbontown
Saw the earth open and gulp her down
And Braddocks army was done so brown
Left without a scalp to its crown
It was on the terrible Earthquakeday
That the Deacon finished the onehoss shay

Now in building of chaises I tell you what
There is always somewhere a weakest spot
In hub tire felloe in spring or thill
In panel or crossbar or floor or sill
In screw bolt thoroughbracelurking still
Find it somewhere you must and will
Above or below or within or without
And thats the reason beyond a doubt
That a chaise breaks down but doesnt wear out

But the Deacon swore as Deacons do
With an I dew vum or an I tell yeou
He would build one shay to beat the taown
N the keounty n all the kentry raoun
It should be so built that it couldn break daown
Fur said the Deacon ts mighty plain
Thut the weakes place mus stan the strain
N the way t fix it uz I maintain
Is only jest
T make that place uz strong uz the rest

So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
Where he could find the strongest oak
That couldnt be split nor bent nor broke
That was for spokes and floor and sills
He sent for lancewood to make the thills
The crossbars were ash from the straightest trees
The panels of whitewood that cuts like cheese
But lasts like iron for things like these
The hubs of logs from the Settlers ellum
Last of its timberthey couldnt sell em
Never an axe had seen their chips
And the wedges flew from between their lips
Their blunt ends frizzled like celerytips
Step and propiron bolt and screw
Spring tire axle and linchpin too
Steel of the finest bright and blue
Thoroughbrace bisonskin thick and wide
Boot top dasher from tough old hide
Found in the pit when the tanner died
That was the way he put her through
There said the Deacon naow shell dew

Do I tell you I rather guess
She was a wonder and nothing less
Colts grew horses beards turned gray
Deacon and deaconess dropped away
Children and grandchildrenwhere were they
But there stood the stout old onehoss shay
As fresh as on Lisbonearthquakeday

EIGHTEEN HUNDREDit came and found
The Deacons masterpiece strong and sound
Eighteen hundred increased by ten
Hahnsum kerridge they called it then
Eighteen hundred and twenty came
Running as usual much the same
Thirty and Forty at last arrive
And then come Fifty and FiftyFive

Little of all we value here
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
Without both feeling and looking queer
In fact theres nothing that keeps its youth
So far as I know but a tree and truth
This is a moral that runs at large
Take itYoure welcomeNo extra charge

FIRST OF Novemberthe Earthquakeday
There are traces of age in the onehoss shay
A general flavor of mild decay
But nothing local as one may say
There couldnt befor the Deacons art
Had made it so like in every part
That there wasnt a chance for one to start
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills
And the floor was just as strong as the sills
And the panels just as strong as the floor
And the whippletree neither less nor more
And the backcrossbar as strong as the fore
And spring and axle and hub encore
And yet as a whole it is past a doubt
In another hour it will be worn out

First of November Fiftyfive
This morning the parson takes a drive
Now small boys get out of the way
Here comes the wonderful onehoss shay
Drawn by a ratrailed ewenecked bay
Huddup said the parsonOff went they

The parson was working his Sundays text
Had got to fifthly and stopped perplexed
At what theMoseswas coming next
All at once the horse stood still
Close by the meetnhouse on the hill
First a shiver and then a thrill
Then something decidedly like a spill
And the parson was sitting upon a rock
At half past nine by the meetnhouse clock
Just the hour of the Earthquake shock
What do you think the parson found
When he got up and stared around
The poor old chaise in a heap or mound
As if it had been to the mill and ground
You see of course if youre not a dunce
How it went to pieces all at once
All at once and nothing first
Just as bubbles do when they burst

End of the wonderful onehoss shay
Logic is logic Thats all I say

Oliver Wendell Holmes 18091894




BALLADE OF A FRIAR
After Clement Marot

Some ten or twenty times a day
To bustle to the town with speed
To dabble in what dirt he may
Le Frere Lubins the man you need
But any sober life to lead
Upon an exemplary plan
Requires a Christian indeed
Le Frere Lubin is not the man

Anothers wealth on his to lay
With all the craft of guile and greed
To leave you bare of pence or pay
Le Frere Lubins the man you need
But watch him with the closest heed
And dun him with what force you can
Hell not refund howeer you plead
Le Frere Lubin is not the man

An honest girl to lead astray
With subtle saw and promised meed
Requires no cunning crone and gray
Le Frere Lubins the man you need
He preaches an ascetic creed
Buttry him with the water can
A dog will drink whateer his breed
Le Frere Lubin is not the man

ENVOY
In good to fail in ill succeed
Le Frere Lubins the man you need
In honest works to lead the van
Le Frere Lubin is not the man

Andrew Lang 18441912




THE CHAMELEON

Oft has it been my lot to mark
A proud conceited talking spark
With eyes that hardly served at most
To guard their master gainst a post
Yet round the world the blade has been
To see whatever could be seen
Returning from his finished tour
Grown ten times perter than before
Whatever word you chance to drop
The traveled fool your mouth will stop
Sir if my judgment youll allow
Ive seenand sure I ought to know
So begs youd pay a due submission
And acquiesce in his decision

Two travelers of such a cast
As oer Arabias wilds they passed
And on their way in friendly chat
Now talked of this and then of that
Discoursed awhile mongst other matter
Of the chameleons form and nature
A stranger animal cries one
Sure never lived beneath the sun
A lizards body lean and long
A fishs head a serpents tongue
Its foot with triple claw disjoined
And what a length of tail behind
How slow its pace and then its hue
Who ever saw so fine a blue

Hold there the other quick replies
Tis greenI saw it with these eyes
As late with open mouth it lay
And warmed it in the sunny ray
Stretched at its ease the beast I viewed
And saw it eat the air for food
Ive seen it sir as well as you
And must again affirm it blue
At leisure I the beast surveyed
Extended in the cooling shade
Tis green tis green sir I assure ye
Green cries the other in a fury
Why sirdye think Ive lost my eyes
Twere no great loss the friend replies
For if they always serve you thus
Youll find them of but little use

So high at last the contest rose
From words they almost came to blows
When luckily came by a third
To him the question they referred
And begged hed tell em if he knew
Whether the thing was green or blue
Sirs cries the umpire cease your pother
The creatures neither one or tother
I caught the animal last night
And viewed it oer by candlelight
I marked it wellt was black as jet
You starebut sirs Ive got it yet
And can produce it Pray sir do
Ill lay my life the thing is blue
And Ill be sworn that when youve seen
The reptile youll pronounce him green

Well then at once to ease the doubt
Replies the man Ill turn him out
And when before your eyes Ive set him
If you dont find him black Ill eat him
He said then full before their sight
Produced the beast and lotwas white

Both stared the man looked wondrous wise
My children the chameleon cries
Then first the creature found a tongue
You all are right and all are wrong
When next you talk of what you view
Think others see as well as you
Nor wonder if you find that none
Prefers your eyesight to his own

After De La Motte by James Merrick 17201769




THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT
A Hindoo Fable

It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined
Who went to see the Elephant
Though all of them were blind
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind

The First approached the Elephant
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side
At once began to bawl
God bless me but the Elephant
Is very like a wall

The Second feeling of the tusk
Cried Ho what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp
To me tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear

The Third approached the animal
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands
Thus boldly up and spake
I see quoth he the Elephant
Is very like a snake

The Fourth reached out an eager hand
And felt about the knee
What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain quoth he
Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear
Said Een the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most
Deny the fact who can
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope
Than seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope
I see quoth he the Elephant
Is very like a rope

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong
Though each was partly in the right
And all were in the wrong

MORAL
So oft in theologic wars
The disputants I ween
Rail on in utter ignorance
Of what each other mean
And prate about an Elephant
Not one of them has seen

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887




THE PHILOSOPHERS SCALES

A monk when his rites sacerdotal were oer
In the depths of his cell with its stonecovered floor
Resigning to thought his chimerical brain
Once formed the contrivance we now shall explain
But whether by magics or alchemys powers
We know not indeed tis no business of ours

Perhaps it was only by patience and care
At last that he brought his invention to bear
In youth twas projected but years stole away
And ere twas complete he was wrinkled and gray
But success is secure unless energy fails
And at length he produced the Philosophers Scales

What were they you ask You shall presently see
These scales were not made to weigh sugar and tea
Oh no for such properties wondrous had they
That qualities feelings and thoughts they could weigh
Together with articles small or immense
From mountains or planets to atoms of sense

Naught was there so bulky but there it would lay
And naught so ethereal but there it would stay
And naught so reluctant but in it must go
All which some examples more clearly will show

The first thing he weighed was the head of Voltaire
Which retained all the wit that had ever been there
As a weight he threw in the torn scrap of a leaf
Containing the prayer of the penitent thief
When the skull rose aloft with so sudden a spell
That it bounced like a ball on the roof of the cell

One time he put in Alexander the Great
With the garment that Dorcas had made for a weight
And though clad in armor from sandals to crown
The hero rose up and the garment went down

A long row of almshouses amply endowed
By a wellesteemed Pharisee busy and proud
Next loaded one scale while the other was pressed
By those mites the poor widow dropped into the chest
Up flew the endowment not weighing an ounce
And down down the farthingworth came with a bounce

By further experiments no matter how
He found that ten chariots weighed less than one plough
A sword with gilt trappings rose up in the scale
Though balanced by only a tenpenny nail
A shield and a helmet a buckler and spear
Weighed less than a widows uncrystallized tear

A lord and a lady went up at full sail
When a bee chanced to light on the opposite scale
Ten doctors ten lawyers two courtiers one earl
Ten counsellors wigs full of powder and curl
All heaped in one balance and swinging from thence
Weighed less than a few grains of candor and sense
A firstwater diamond with brilliants begirt
Than one good potato just washed from the dirt
Yet not mountains of silver and gold could suffice
One pearl to outweightwas the Pearl of Great Price

Last of all the whole world was bowled in at the grate
With the soul of a beggar to serve for a weight
When the former sprang up with so strong a rebuff
That it made a vast rent and escaped at the roof
When balanced in air it ascended on high
And sailed up aloft a balloon in the sky
While the scale with the soul int so mightily fell
That it jerked the philosopher out of his cell

Jane Taylor 17831824




THE MAIDEN AND THE LILY

A lily in my garden grew
Amid the thyme and clover
No fairer lily ever blew
Search all the wide world over
Its beauty passed into my heart
I know twas very silly
But I was then a foolish maid
And ita perfect lily

One day a learned man came by
With years of knowledge laden
And him I questioned with a sigh
Like any foolish maiden
Wise sir please tell me wherein lies
I know the questions silly
The something that my art defies
And makes a perfect lily

He smiled then bending plucked the flower
Then tore it leaf and petal
And talked to me for full an hour
And thought the point to settle
Therein it lies at length he cries
And II know twas silly
Could only weep and say But where
O doctor wheres my lily

John Fraser 17501811




THE OWLCRITIC

Who stuffed that white owl No one spoke in the shop
The barber was busy and he couldnt stop
The customers waiting their turns were all reading
The Daily the Herald the Post little heeding
The young man who blurted out such a blunt question
Not one raised a head or even made a suggestion
And the barber kept on shaving

Dont you see Mister Brown
Cried the youth with a frown
How wrong the whole thing is
How preposterous each wing is
How flattened the head is how jammed down the neck is
In short the whole owl what an ignorant wreck tis
I make no apology
Ive learned owleology
Ive passed days and nights in a hundred collections
And cannot be blinded to any deflections
Arising from unskilful fingers that fail
To stuff a bird right from his beak to his tail
Mister Brown Mister Brown
Do take that bird down
Or youll soon be the laughingstock all over town
And the barber kept on shaving

Ive studied owls
And other night fowls
And I tell you
What I know to be true
An owl cannot roost
With his limbs so unloosed
No owl in this world
Ever had his claws curled
Ever had his legs slanted
Ever had his bill canted
Ever had his neck screwed
Into that attitude
He cant do it because
Tis against all birdlaws
Anatomy teaches
Ornithology preaches
An owl has a toe
That cant turn out so
Ive made the white owl my study for years
And to see such a job almost moves me to tears
Mister Brown Im amazed
You should be so gone crazed
As to put up a bird
In that posture absurd
To look at that owl really brings on a dizziness
The man who stuffed him dont half know his business
And the barber kept on shaving

Examine those eyes
Im filled with surprise
Taxidermists should pass
Off on you such poor glass
So unnatural they seem
Theyd make Audubon scream
And John Burroughs laugh
To encounter such chaff
Do take that bird down
Have him stuffed again Brown
And the barber kept on shaving

With some sawdust and bark
I could stuff in the dark
An owl better than that
I could make an old hat
Look more like an owl
Than that horrid fowl
Stuck up there so stiff like a side of coarse leather
In fact about him theres not one natural feather

Just then with a wink and a sly normal lurch
The owl very gravely got down from his perch
Walked round and regarded his faultfinding critic
Who thought he was stuffed with a glance analytic
And then fairly hooted as if he would say
Your learnings at fault this time any way
Dont waste it again on a live bird I pray
Im an owl youre another Sir Critic goodday
And the barber kept on shaving

James Thomas Fields 18161881




THE BALLAD OF IMITATION
Cest imiter quelquun que de planter des chouxAlfred De Musset

If they hint O Musician the piece that you played
Is naught but a copy of Chopin or Spohr
That the ballad you sing is but merely conveyed
From the stock of the Ames and the Purcells of yore
That theres nothing in short in the words or the score
That is not as outworn as the Wandering Jew
Make answerBeethoven could scarcely do more
That the man who plants cabbages imitates too

If they tell you Sir Artist your light and your shade
Are simply adapted from other mens lore
Thatplainly to speak of a spade as a spade
Youve stolen your grouping from three or from four
That however the writer the truth may deplore
Twas Gainsborough painted your Little Boy Blue
Smile only serenelythough cut to the core
For the man who plants cabbages imitates too

And you too my Poet be never dismayed
If they whisper your EpicSir Eperon dOr
Is nothing but Tennyson thinly arrayed
In a tissue thats taken from Morriss store
That no one in fact but a child could ignore
That you lift or accommodate all that you do
Take heartthough your Pegasus withers be sore
For the man who plants cabbages imitates too

POSTCRIPTUMAnd you whom we all so adore
Dear Critics whose verdicts are always so new
One word in your ear There were Critics before
And the man who plants cabbages imitates too

Austin Dobson 18401921




THE CONUNDRUM OF THE WORKSHOPS

When the flush of a newborn sun fell first on Edens green and gold
Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in
 the mould
And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to
 his mighty heart
Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves Its pretty but is it Art

Wherefore he called to his wife and fled to fashion his work anew
The first of his race who cared a fig for the first most dread review
And he left his lore to the use of his sonsand that was a glorious gain
When the Devil chuckled Is it Art in the ear of the branded Cain

They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart
Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks Its striking but is it Art
The stone was dropped at the quarryside and the idle derrick swung
While each man talked of the aims of Art and each in an alien tongue

They fought and they talked in the North and the South they talked
 and they fought in the West
Till the waters rose on the pitiful land and the poor Red Clay had rest
Had rest till that dank blankcanvas dawn when the dove was
 preened to start
And the Devil bubbled below the keel Its human but is it Art

The tale is as old as the Eden Treeand new as the newcut tooth
For each man knows ere his lipthatch grows he is master
 of Art and Truth
And each man hears as the twilight nears to the beat of his dying heart
The Devil drum on the darkened pane You did it but was it Art

We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplicepeg
We have learned to bottle ourparents twain in the yelk of an addled egg
We know that the tail must wag the dog for the horse is drawn
 by the cart
But the Devil whoops as he whooped of old Its clever but is it Art

When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the clubrooms
 green and gold
The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould
They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves
 and the ink and the anguish start
For the Devil mutters behind the leaves Its pretty but is it Art

Now if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow
And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago
And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through
By the favor of God we might know as muchas our father Adam knew

Rudyard Kipling 18651936




THE VASE

From the madding crowd they stand apart
The maidens four and the Work of Art

And none might tell from sight alone
In which had Culture ripest grown

The Gotham Million fair to see
The Philadelphia Pedigree

The Boston Mind of azure hue
Or the soulful Soul from Kalamazoo

For all loved Art in a seemly way
With an earnest soul and a capital A



Long they worshipped but no one broke
The sacred stillness until up spoke

The Western one from the nameless place
Who blushing said What a lovely vace

Over three faces a sad smile flew
And they edged away from Kalamazoo

But Gothams haughty soul was stirred
To crush the stranger with one small word

Deftly hiding reproof in praise
She cries Tis indeed a lovely vaze

But brief her unworthy triumph when
The lofty one from the home of Penn

With the consciousness of two grandpapas
Exclaims It is quite a lovely vahs

And glances round with an anxious thrill
Awaiting the word of Beacon Hill

But the Boston maid smiles courteouslee
And gently murmurs Oh pardon me

I did not catch your remark because
I was so entranced with that charming vaws

Dies erit praegelida
Sinistra quum Bostonia

James Jeffrey Roche 18471908




HEM AND HAW

Hem and Haw were the sons of sin
Created to shally and shirk
Hem lay round and Haw looked on
While God did all the work

Hem was a fogy and Haw was a prig
For both had the dull dull mind
And whenever they found a thing to do
They yammered and went it blind

Hem was the father of bigots and bores
As the sands of the sea were they
And Haw was the father of all the tribe
Who criticise today

But God was an artist from the first
And knew what he was about
While over his shoulder sneered these two
And advised him to rub it out

They prophesied ruin ere man was made
Such folly must surely fail
And when he was done Do you think my Lord
Hes better without a tail

And still in the honest working world
With posture and hint and smirk
These sons of the devil are standing by
While Man does all the work

They balk endeavor and baffle reform
In the sacred name of law
And over the quavering voice of Hem
Is the droning voice of Haw

Bliss Carman 18611929




MINIVER CHEEVY

Miniver Cheevy child of scorn
Grew lean while he assailed the seasons
He wept that he was ever born
And he had reasons

Miniver loved the days of old
When swords were bright and steeds were prancing
The vision of a warrior bold
Would set him dancing

Miniver sighed for what was not
And dreamed and rested from his labors
He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot
And Priams neighbors

Miniver mourned the ripe renown
That made so many a name so fragrant
He mourned Romance now on the town
And Art a vagrant

Miniver loved the Medici
Albeit he had never seen one
He would have sinned incessantly
Could he have been one

Miniver cursed the commonplace
And eyed a khaki suit with loathing
He missed the medieval grace
Of iron clothing

Miniver scorned the gold he sought
But sore annoyed was he without it
Miniver thought and thought and thought
And thought about it

Miniver Cheevy born too late
Scratched his head and kept on thinking
Miniver coughed and called it fate
And kept on drinking

Edwin Arlington Robinson 18691935




THEN AGIN

Jim Bowker he said ef hed had a fair show
And a big enough town for his talents to grow
And the least bit assistance in hoein his row
Jim Bowker he said
Hed filled the world full of the sound of his name
An clumb the top round in the ladder of fame
It may have been so
I dunno
Jest so it might been
Then agin

But he had tarnal luckeverythin went agin him
The arrers er fortune they allus ud pin him
So he didnt get no chance to show off what was in him
Jim Bowker he said
Ef hed had a fair show you couldnt tell where hed come
An the feats hed adone an the heights hed aclumb
It may have been so
I dunno
Jest so it might been
Then agin

But were all like Jim Bowker thinks I more or less
Charge fate for our bad luck ourselves for success
An give fortune the blame for all our distress
As Jim Bowker he said
Ef it hadn been for luck an misfortune an sich
We might abeen famous an might abeen rich
It might be jest so
I dunno
Jest so it might been
Then agin

Sam Walter Foss 18581911




A CONSERVATIVE

The garden beds I wandered by
One bright and cheerful morn
When I found a newfledged butterfly
Asitting on a thorn
A black and crimson butterfly
All doleful and forlorn

I thought that life could have no sting
To infant butterflies
So I gazed on this unhappy thing
With wonder and surprise
While sadly with his waving wing
He wiped his weeping eyes

Said I What can the matter be
Why weepest thou so sore
With garden fair and sunlight free
And flowers in goodly store
But he only turned away from me
And burst into a roar

Cried he My legs are thin and few
Where once I had a swarm
Soft fuzzy fura joy to view
Once kept my body warm
Before these flapping wingthings grew
To hamper and deform

At that outrageous bug I shot
The fury of mine eye
Said I in scorn all burning hot
In rage and anger high
You ignominious idiot
Those wings are made to fly

I do not want to fly said he
I only want to squirm
And he drooped his wings dejectedly
But still his voice was firm
I do not want to be a fly
I want to be a worm

O yesterday of unknown lack
Today of unknown bliss
I left my fool in red and black
The last I saw was this
The creature madly climbing back
Into his chrysalis

Charlotte Perkins Stetson Gilman 18601935




SIMILAR CASES

There was once a little animal
No bigger than a fox
And on five toes he scampered
Over Tertiary rocks
They called him Eohippus
And they called him very small
And they thought him of no value
When they thought of him at all
For the lumpish old Dinoceras
And Coryphodon so slow
Were the heavy aristocracy
In days of long ago

Said the little Eohippus
I am going to be a horse
And on my middle fingernails
To run my earthly course
Im going to have a flowing tail
Im going to have a mane
Im going to stand fourteen hands high
On the psychozoic plain

The Coryphodon was horrified
The Dinoceras was shocked
And they chased young Eohippus
But he skipped away and mocked
And they laughed enormous laughter
And they groaned enormous groans
And they bade young Eohippus
Go view his fathers bones
Said they You always were as small
And mean as now we see
And thats conclusive evidence
That youre always going to be
What Be a great tall handsome beast
With hoofs to gallop on
Why Youd have to change your nature
Said the Loxolophodon
They considered him disposed of
And retired with gait serene
That was the way they argued
In the early Eocene

There was once an Anthropoidal Ape
Far smarter than the rest
And everything that they could do
He always did the best
So they naturally disliked him
And they gave him shoulders cool
And when they had to mention him
They said he was a fool

Cried this pretentious Ape one day
Im going to be a Man
And stand upright and hunt and fight
And conquer all I can
Im going to cut down forest trees
To make my houses higher
Im going to kill the Mastodon
Im going to make a fire

Loud screamed the Anthropoidal Apes
With laughter wild and gay
They tried to catch that boastful one
But he always got away
So they yelled at him in chorus
Which he minded not a whit
And they pelted him with cocoanuts
Which didnt seem to hit
And then they gave him reasons
Which they thought of much avail
To prove how his preposterous
Attempt was sure to fail
Said the sages In the first place
The thing cannot be done
And second if it could be
It would not be any fun
And third and most conclusive
And admitting no reply
You would have to change your nature
We should like to see you try
They chuckled then triumphantly
These lean and hairy shapes
For these things passed as arguments
With the Anthropoidal Apes

There was once a Neolithic Man
An enterprising wight
Who made his chopping implements
Unusually bright
Unusually clever he
Unusually brave
And he drew delightful Mammoths
On the borders of his cave
To his Neolithic neighbors
Who were startled and surprised
Said he My friends in course of time
We shall be civilized
We are going to live in cities
We are going to fight in wars
We are going to eat three times a day
Without the natural cause
We are going to turn life upside down
About a thing called gold
We are going to want the earth and take
As much as we can hold
We are going to wear great piles of stuff
Outside our proper skins
We are going to have diseases
And Accomplishments And Sins

Then they all rose up in fury
Against their boastful friend
For prehistoric patience
Cometh quickly to an end
Said one This is chimerical
Utopian Absurd
Said another What a stupid life
Too dull upon my word
Cried all Before such things can come
You idiotic child
You must alter Human Nature
And they all sat back and smiled
Thought they An answer to that last
It will be hard to find
It was a clinching argument
To the Neolithic Mind

MAN AND THE ASCIDIAN
A Morality

The Ancestor remote of Man
Says Darwin is the Ascidian
A scanty sort of waterbeast
That ninety million years at least
Before Gorillas came to be
Went swimming up and down the sea

Their ancestors the pious praise
And like to imitate their ways
How then does our first parent live
What lesson has his life to give

The Ascidian tadpole young and gay
Doth Life with one bright eye survey
His consciousness has easy play
Hes sensitive to grief and pain
Has tail a spine and bears a brain
And everything that fits the state
Of creatures we call vertebrate
But age comes on with sudden shock
He sticks his head against a rock
His tail drops off his eye drops in
His brains absorbed into his skin
He does not move nor feel nor know
The tidal waters ebb and flow
But still abides unstirred alone
A sucker sticking to a stone

And we his children truly we
In youth are like the Tadpole free
And where we would we blithely go
Have brains and hearts and feel and know
Then Age comes on To Habit we
Affix ourselves and are not free
The Ascidians rooted to a rock
And we are bondslaves of the clock
Our rocks are MedicineLettersLaw
From these our heads we cannot draw
Our loves drop off our hearts drop in
And daily thicker grows our skin

Ah scarce we live we scarcely know
The wide worlds moving ebb and flow
The clanging currents ring and shock
But we are rooted to the rock
And thus at ending of his span
Blind deaf and indolent does Man
Revert to the Ascidian

Andrew Lang 18441912




THE CALFPATH

One day through the primeval wood
A calf walked home as good calves should
But made a trail all bent askew
A crooked trail as all calves do

Since then two hundred years have fled
And I infer the calf is dead
But still he left behind his trail
And thereby hangs my moral tale

The trail was taken up next day
By a lone dog that passed that way
And then a wise bellwether sheep
Pursued the trail oer vale and steep
And drew the flock behind him too
As good bellwethers always do

And from that day oer hill and glade
Through those old woods a path was made
And many men wound in and out
And dodged and turned and bent about
And uttered words of righteous wrath
Because twas such a crooked path

But still they followeddo not laugh
The first migrations of that calf
And through this winding woodway stalked
Because he wobbled when he walked

This forest path became a lane
That bent and turned and turned again
This crooked lane became a road
Where many a poor horse with his load
Toiled on beneath the burning sun
And traveled some three miles in one
And thus a century and a half
They trod the footsteps of that calf

The years passed on in swiftness fleet
The road became a village street
And this before men were aware
A citys crowded thoroughfare
And soon the central street was this
Of a renowned metropolis
And men two centuries and a half
Trod in the footsteps of that calf

Each day a hundred thousand rout
Followed the zigzag calf about
And oer his crooked journey went
The traffic of a continent
A hundred thousand men were led
By one calf near three centuries dead
They followed still his crooked way
And lost one hundred years a day
For thus such reverence is lent
To wellestablished precedent

A moral lesson this might teach
Were I ordained and called to preach
For men are prone to go it blind
Along the calfpaths of the mind
And work away from sun to sun
To do what other men have done
They follow in the beaten track
And out and in and forth and back
And still their devious course pursue
To keep the path that others do

But how the wise old woodgods laugh
Who saw the first primeval calf
Ah many things this tale might teach
But I am not ordained to preach

Sam Walter Foss 18581911




WEDDED BLISS

O come and be my mate said the Eagle to the Hen
I love to soar but then
I want my mate to rest
Forever in the nest
Said the Hen I cannot fly
I have no wish to try
But I joy to see my mate careering through the sky
They wed and cried Ah this is Love my own
And the Hen sat and the Eagle soared alone

O come and be my mate said the Lion to the Sheep
My love for you is deep
I slaya Lion should
But you are mild and good
Said the Sheep I do no ill
Could not had I the will
But I joy to see my mate pursue devour and kill
They wed and cried Ah this is Love my own
And the Sheep browsed the Lion prowled alone

O come and be my mate said the Salmon to the Clam
You are not wise but I am
I know the sea and stream as well
You know nothing but your shell
Said the Clam Im slow of motion
But my love is all devotion
And I joy to have my mate traverse lake and stream and ocean
They wed and cried Ah this is Love my own
And the Clam sucked the Salmon swam alone

PARADISE A HINDOO LEGEND

A Hindoo died a happy thing to do
When fifty years united to a shrew
Released he hopefully for entrance cries
Before the gates of Brahmas paradise
Hast been through purgatory Brahma said
I have been married and he hung his head
Come in come in and welcome too my son
Marriage and purgatory are as one
In bliss extreme he entered heavens door
And knew the peace he neer had known before

He scarce had entered in the gardens fair
Another Hindoo asked admission there
The selfsame question Brahma asked again
Hast been through purgatory No what then
Thou canst not enter did the god reply
He who went in was there no more than I
All that is true but he has married been
And so on earth has suffered for all his sin
Married Tis well for Ive been married twice
Begone Well have no fools in paradise

George Birdseye 18441919




AD CHLOEN M A
Fresh From Her Cambridge Examination

Lady very fair are you
And your eyes are very blue
And your hose
And your brow is like the snow
And the various things you know
Goodness knows

And the roseflush on your cheek
And your algebra and Greek
Perfect are
And that loving lustrous eye
Recognizes in the sky
Every star

You have pouting piquant lips
You can doubtless an eclipse
Calculate
But for your cerulean hue
I had certainly from you
Met my fate

If by an arrangement dual
I were Adams mixed with Whewell
Then some day
I as wooer perhaps might come
To so sweet an Artium
Magistra

Mortimer Collins 18271876




AS LIKE THE WOMAN AS YOU CAN

As like the Woman as you can
Thus the New Adam was beguiled
So shall you touch the Perfect Man
God in the Garden heard and smiled
Your father perished with his day
A clot of passions fierce and blind
He fought he hacked he crushed his way
Your muscles Child must be of mind

The Brute that lurks and irks within
How till you have him gagged and bound
Escape the foulest form of Sin
God in the Garden laughed and frowned
So vile so rank the bestial mood
In which the race is bid to be
It wrecks the Rarer Womanhood
Live therefore you for Purity

Take for your mate no gallant croup
No girl all grace and natural will
To work her mission were to stoop
Maybe to lapse from Well to Ill
Choose one of whom your grosser make
God in the Garden laughed outright
The true refining touch may take
Till both attain to Lifes last height

There equal purged of soul and sense
Beneficent highthinking just
Beyond the appeal of Violence
Incapable of common Lust
In mental Marriage still prevail
God in the Garden hid His face
Till you achieve that FemaleMale
In which shall culminate the race

William Ernest Henley 18491903




NO FAULT IN WOMEN

No fault in women to refuse
The offer which they most would choose
No fault in women to confess
How tedious they are in their dress
No fault in women to lay on
The tincture of vermilion
And there to give the cheek a dye
Of white where Nature doth deny
No fault in women to make show
Of largeness when theyre nothing so
When true it is the outside swells
With inward buckram little else
No fault in women though they be
But seldom from suspicion free
No fault in womankind at all
If they but slip and never fall

Robert Herrick 15911674




ARE WOMEN FAIR

Are women fair Ay wondrous fair to see too
Are women sweet Yea passing sweet they be too
Most fair and sweet to them that only love them
Chaste and discreet to all save those that prove them

Are women wise Not wise but they be witty
Are women witty Yea the more the pity
They are so witty and in wit so wily
That be you neer so wise they will beguile ye

Are women fools Not fools but fondlings many
Can women found be faithful unto any
When snowwhite swans do turn to color sable
Then women fond will be both firm and stable

Are women saints No saints nor yet no devils
Are women good Not good but needful evils
So Angellike that devils I do not doubt them
So needful evils that few can live without them

Are women proud Ay passing proud and praise them
Are women kind Ay wondrous kind and please them
Or so imperious no man can endure them
Or so kindhearted any may procure them

Francis Davison  fl 1602




A STRONG HAND

Tenderhanded stroke a nettle
And it stings you for your pains
Grasp it like a lad of mettle
And it soft as silk remains

So it is with these fair creatures
Use them kindly they rebel
But be rough as nutmeg graters
And the rogues obey you well

Aaron Hill 16851750




WOMENS LONGING
From Women Pleased

Tell me what is that only thing
For which all women long
Yet having what they most desire
To have it does them wrong

Tis not to be chaste nor fair
Such gifts malice may impair
Richly trimmed to walk or ride
Or to wanton unespied
To preserve an honest name
And so to give it up to fame
These are toys In good or ill
They desire to have their will
Yet when they have it they abuse it
For they know not how to use it

John Fletcher 15791625




TRIOLET

All women born are so perverse
No man need boast their love possessing
If naught seem better nothings worse
All women born are so perverse
From Adams wife that proved a curse
Though God had made her for a blessing
All women born are so perverse
No man need boast their love possessing

Robert Bridges 18441930




THE FAIR CIRCASSIAN

Forty Viziers saw I go
Up to the Seraglio
Burning each and every man
For the fair Circassian

Ere the morn had disappeared
Every Vizier wore a beard
Ere the afternoon was born
Every Vizier came back shorn

Let the man that woos to win
Woo with an unhairy chin
Thus she said and as she bid
Each devoted Vizier did

From the beards a cord she made
Looped it to the balustrade
Glided down and went away
To her own Circassia

When the Sultan heard waxed he
Somewhat wroth and presently
In the noose themselves did lend
Every Vizier did suspend

Sages all this rhyme who read
Guard your beards with prudent heed
And beware the wily plans
Of the fair Circassians

Richard Garnett 18351906




THE FEMALE PHAETON

Thus Kitty beautiful and young
And wild as colt untamed
Bespoke the fair from whence she sprung
With little rage inflamed

Inflamed with rage at sad restraint
Which wise mamma ordained
And sorely vexed to play the saint
Whilst wit and beauty reigned

Shall I thumb holy books confined
With Abigails forsaken
Kittys for other things designed
Or I am much mistaken

Must Lady Jenny frisk about
And visit with her cousins
At balls must she make all the rout
And bring home hearts by dozens

What has she better pray than I
What hidden charms to boast
That all mankind for her should die
Whilst I am scarce a toast

Dearest mamma for once let me
Unchained my fortune try
Ill have my earl as well as she
Or know the reason why

Ill soon with Jennys pride quit score
Make all her lovers fall
Theyll grieve I was not loosed before
She I was loosed at all

Fondness prevailed mamma gave way
Kitty at hearts desire
Obtained the chariot for a day
And set the world on fire

Matthew Prior 16641721




THE LURE

What bait do you use said a Saint to the Devil
When you fish where the souls of men abound
Well for special tastes said the King of Evil
Gold and Fame are the best Ive found

But for general use asked the Saint Ah then
Said the Demon I angle for Man not men
And a thing I hate
Is to change my bait
So I fish with a woman the whole year round

John Boyle OReilly 18441890




THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES

When the Himalayan peasant meets the hebear in his pride
He shouts to scare the monster who will often turn aside
But the shebear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail
For the female of the species is more deadly than the male

When Nag the wayside cobra hears the careless foot of man
He will sometimes wriggle sideways and avoid it if he can
But his mate makes no such motion where she camps beside the trail
For the female of the species is more deadly than the male

When the early Jesuit fathers preached to Hurons and Choctaws
They prayed to be delivered from the vengeance of the squaws
Twas the women not the warriors turned those stark enthusiasts pale
For the female of the species is more deadly than the male

Mans timid heart is bursting with the things he must not say
For the Woman that God gave him isnt his to give away
But when hunter meets with husband each confirms the others tale
The female of the species is more deadly than the male

Man a bear in most relationsworm and savage otherwise
Man propounds negotiations Man accepts the compromise
Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact
To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act

Fear or foolishness impels him ere he lay the wicked low
To concede some form of trial even to his fiercest foe
Mirth obscene diverts his angerDoubt and Pity oft perplex
Him in dealing with an issueto the scandal of The Sex

But the Woman that God gave him every fibre of her frame
Proves her launched for one sole issue armed and engined for the same
And to serve that single issue lest the generations fail
The female of the species must be deadlier than the male

She who faces Death by torture for each life beneath her breast
May not deal in doubt or pitymust not swerve for fact or jest
These be purely male diversionsnot in these her honor dwells
She the Other Law we live by is that Law and nothing else

She can bring no more to living than the powers that make her great
As the Mother of the Infant and the Mistress of the Mate
And when Babe and Man are lacking and she strides unclaimed to claim
Her right as femme and baron her equipment is the same

She is wedded to convictionsin default of grosser ties
Her contentions are her children Heaven help him who denies
He will meet no cool discussion but the instant whitehot wild
Wakened female of the species warring as for spouse and child

Unprovoked and awful chargeseven so the shebear fights
Speech that drips corrodes and poisonseven so the cobra bites
Scientific vivisection of one nerve till it is raw
And the victim writhes in anguishlike the Jesuit with the squaw

So it comes that Man the coward when he gathers to confer
With his fellowbraves in council dare not leave a place for her
Where at war with Life and Conscience he uplifts his erring hands
To some God of Abstract Justicewhich no woman understands

And Man knows it Knows moreover that the Woman that God gave him
Must command but may not governshall enthral but not enslave him
And She knows because She warns him and Her instincts never fail
That the Female of Her Species is more deadly than the Male

Rudyard Kipling 18651936




THE WOMAN WITH THE SERPENTS TONGUE

She is not old she is not young
The woman with the Serpents Tongue
The haggard cheek the hungering eye
The poisoned words that wildly fly
The famished face the fevered hand
Who slights the worthiest in the land
Sneers at the just contemns the brave
And blackens goodness in its grave

In truthful numbers be she sung
The Woman with the Serpents Tongue
Concerning whom Fame hints at things
Told but in shrugs and whisperings
Ambitious from her natal hour
And scheming all her life for power
With little left of seemly pride
With venomed fangs she cannot hide
Who half makes love to you today

Tomorrow gives her guest away
Burnt up within by that strange soul
She cannot slake or yet control
Malignantlipped unkind unsweet
Past all example indiscreet
Hectic and always overstrung
The Woman with the Serpents Tongue

To think that such as she can mar
Names that among the noblest are
That hands like hers can touch the springs
That move who knows what men and things
That on her will their fates have hung
The Woman with the Serpents Tongue

William Watson 18581935




SUPPOSE

How sad if by some strange new law
All kisses scarred
For she who is most beautiful
Would be most marred

And we might be surprised to see
Some lovely wife
Smoothvisaged while a seeming prude
Was marked for life

Anne Reeve Aldrich 18661892




TOO CANDID BY HALF

As Tom and his wife were discoursing one day
Of their several faults in a bantering way
Said she Though my wit you disparage
Im sure my dear husband our friends will attest
This much at the least that my judgment is best
Quoth Tom So they said at our marriage

John Godfrey Saxe 18161887




FABLE

The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel
And the former called the latter Little Prig
Bun replied
You are doubtless very big
But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together
To make up a year
And a sphere
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place
If Im not so large as you
You are not so small as I
And not half so spry

Ill not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track
Talents differ all is well and wisely put
If I cannot carry forests on thy back
Neither can you crack a nut

Ralph Waldo Emerson 18031882

WOMANS WILL

PLAYS

Alas how soon the hours are over
Counted us out to play the lover
And how much narrower is the stage
Allotted us to play the sage

But when we play the fool how wide
The theatre expands beside
How long the audience sits before us
How many prompters what a chorus

Walter Savage Landor 17751864




THE REMEDY WORSE THAN THE DISEASE

I sent for Ratcliffe was so ill
That other doctors gave me over
He felt my pulse prescribed his pill
And I was likely to recover

But when the wit began to wheeze
And wine had warmed the politician
Cured yesterday of my disease
I died last night of my physician

Matthew Prior 16641721




THE NET OF LAW

The net of law is spread so wide
No sinner from its sweep may hide

Its meshes are so fine and strong
They take in every child of wrong

O wondrous web of mystery
Big fish alone escape from thee

James Jeffrey Roche 18471908




COLOGNE

In Koln a town of monks and bones
And pavements fanged with murderous stones
And rags and hags and hideous wenches
I counted two and seventy stenches
All well defined and several stinks
Ye Nymphs that reign oer sewers and sinks
The river Rhine it is well known
Doth wash your city of Cologne
But tell me Nymphs what power divine
Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine

Samuel Taylor Coleridge 17721834

CERTAIN MAXIMS OF HAFIZ

I
If It be pleasant to look on stalled in the packed serai
Does not the Young Man try Its temper and pace ere he buy
If She be pleasant to look on what does the Young Man say
Lo She is pleasant to look on give Her to me today

II
Yea though a Kaffir die to him is remitted Jehannum
If he borrowed in life from a native at sixty per cent per annum

III
Blister we not for bursati So when the heart is vexed
The pain of one maidens refusal is drowned in the pain of the next

IV
The temper of chums the love of your wife and a new pianos tune
Which of the three will you trust at the end of an Indian June

V
Who are the rulers of Indto whom shall we bow the knee
Make your peace with the women and men will make you L G

VI
Does the woodpecker flit round the young ferash
Does the grass clothe a newbuilt wall
Is she under thirty the woman who holds a boy in her thrall

VI
If She grow suddenly graciousreflect Is it all for thee
The blackbuck is stalked through the bullock and Man through jealousy

VIII
Seek not for favor of women So shall you find it indeed
Does not the boar break cover just when youre lighting a weed

IX
If He play being young and unskilful for shekels of silver and gold
Take His money my son praising Allah The kid was ordained to be sold

X
With a weed among men or horses verily this is the best
That you work him in office or dogcart lightlybut give him no rest

XI
Pleasant the snaffle of Courtship improving the manners and carriage
But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thornbit
 of Marriage

XII
As the thriftless gold of the babul so is the gold that we spend
On a Derby Sweep or our neighbors wife or the horse that we buy
 from a friend

XIII
The ways of a man with a maid be strange yet simple and tame
To the ways of a man with a horse when selling or racing that same

XIV
In public Her face turneth to thee and pleasant Her smile when ye meet
It is ill The cold rocks of ElGidar smile thus on the waves at
 their feet
In public Her face is averted with anger She nameth thy name
It is well Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game

XV
If She have spoken a word remember thy lips are sealed
And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed
If She have written a letter delay not an instant but burn it
Tear it in pieces O Fool and the wind to her mate shall return it
If there be trouble to Herward and a lie of the blackest can clear
Lie while thy lips can move or a man is alive to hear

XVI
My Son if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give oer
Yet lip meets with lip at the lastwardget out
She has been there before
They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose
 who are lacking in lore

XVII
If we fall in the race though we win the hoofslide is scarred
 on the course
Though Allah and Earth pardon Sin remaineth forever Remorse

XVIII
By all I am misunderstood if the Matron shall say or the Maid
Alas I do not understand my son be thou nowise afraid
In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed

XIX
My Son if I Hafiz thy father take hold of thy knees in my pain
Demanding thy name on stamped paper one day or one hourrefrain
Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest
 another mans chain

AN EPITAPH

A lovely young lady I mourn in my rhymes

Her figure was good she had very fine eyes
And her talk was a mixture of foolish and wise
Her adorers were many and one of them said
She waltzed rather well Its a pity shes dead

A GENERAL SUMMARY

We are very slightly changed
From the semiapes who ranged
Indias prehistoric clay
Whoso drew the longest bow
Ran his brother down you know
As we run men down today
Dowb the first of all his race
Met the Mammoth face to face
On the lake or in the cave
Stole the steadiest canoe
Ate the quarry others slew
Diedand took the finest grave

When they scratched the reindeerbone
Someone made the sketch his own
Filched it from the artistthen
Even in those early days
Won a simple Viceroys praise
Through the toil of other men
Ere they hewed the Sphinxs visage
Favoritism governed kissage
Even as it does in this age

Who shall doubt the secret hid
Under Cheops pyramid
Was that the contractor did
Cheops out of several millions
Or that Josephs sudden rise
To Comptroller of Supplies
Was a fraud of monstrous size
On King Pharaohs swart Civilians

Thus the artless songs I sing
Do not deal with anything
New or never said before
As it was in the beginning
Is today official sinning
And shall be for evermore

Rudyard Kipling 18651936











THE MIMICS










AN OMAR FOR LADIES

I
One for her Club and her own Latchkey fights
Another wastes in Study her good Nights
Ah take the Clothes and let the Culture go
Nor heed the grumble of the Womens Rights

Look at the Shopgirl all about usLo
The Wages of a month she says I blow
Into a Hat and when my hair is waved
Doubtless my Friend will take me to the Show

And she who saved her coin for Flannels red
And she who caught Pneumonia instead
Will both be Underground in Fifty Years
And Prudence pays no Premium to the dead

Th exclusive Style you set your heart upon
Gets to the Bargain countersand anon
Like monograms on a Salesladys tie
Cheers but a momentsoon for you tis gone

Think in the sad Four Hundreds gilded halls
Whose endless Leisure evn themselves appalls
How Pingpong raged so highthen faded out
To those far Suburbs that still chase its Balls

They say Sixth Avenue and the Bowery keep
The dernier cri that once was far from cheap
Green veils one season chicDepartment stores
Mark down in vainno profit shall they reap

II
I sometimes think that never lasts so long
The Style as when it starts a bit too strong
That all the Pompadours the parterre boasts
Some Chorusgirl began with Dance and Song

And this Revival of the Chignon low
That fills the most of us with helpless Woe
Ah criticise it Softly for who knows
What longnecked Peeress had to wear it so

Ah my beloved try each Style you meet
Today brooks no loose ends you must be neat
Tomorrow why tomorrow you may be
Wearing it down your back like Marguerite

For some we once admired the Very Best
That ever a French handboned Corset prest
Wore what they used to call Prunella Boots
And put on Nightcaps ere they went to rest

And we that now make fun of Waterfalls
They wore and whom their Crinoline appalls
Ourselves shall from old dusty Fashion plates
Assist our Children in their Costume balls

Ah make the most of what we yet may wear
Before we grow so old that we dont care
Before we have our Hats made all alike
Sans Plumes sans Wings sans Chiffon andsans Hair

III
Alike to her who Dines both Loud and Long
Or her who Banting shuns the Dinnergong
Some Doctor from his Office chair will shout
It makes no Differenceboth of you are Wrong

Why all the HealthReformers who discussed
High Heels and Corsets learnedly are thrust
Squaretoed and Waistless forth their Duds are scorned
And Venus might as well have been a Bust

Myself when slim did eagerly frequent
Delsarte and Ling and heard great Argument
Of muscles trained to Hold me up but still
Spent on my Modiste what Id always spent

With walking Clubs I did the best I could
With my own Feet I tramped my Ten Miles good
And this was All that I got out of it
I ate much more for Dinner than I should



And fear not lest your Rheumatism seize
The Joy of Life from other peoples Sprees
The Art will not have Perishedau contraire
Posterity will practise it with Ease

When you and I have ceased Champagne to Sup
Be sure there will be More to Keep it Up
And while we pat Old Tabby by the fire
Full many a Girl will lead her Brindled Pup

Josephine Daskam Bacon 1876




WHEN LOVELY WOMAN
After Goldsmith

When lovely woman wants a favor
And finds too late that man wont bend
What earthly circumstance can save her
From disappointment in the end

The only way to bring him over
The last experiment to try
Whether a husband or a lover
If he have feeling isto cry

Phoebe Cary 18241871




FRAGMENT IN IMITATION OF WORDSWORTH

There is a river clear and fair
Tis neither broad nor narrow
It winds a little here and there
It winds about like any hare
And then it holds as straight a course
As on the turnpike road a horse
Or through the air an arrow

The trees that grow upon the shore
Have grown a hundred years or more
So long there is no knowing
Old Daniel Dobson does not know
When first those trees began to grow
But still they grew and grew and grew
As if theyd nothing else to do
But ever must be growing

The impulses of air and sky
Have reared their stately heads so high
And clothed their boughs with green
Their leaves the dews of evening quaff
And when the wind blows loud and keen
Ive seen the jolly timbers laugh
And shake their sides with merry glee
Wagging their heads in mockery

Fixed are their feet in solid earth
Where winds can never blow
But visitings of deeper birth
Have reached their roots below
For they have gained the rivers brink
And of the living waters drink

Theres little Will a five years child
He is my youngest boy
To look on eyes so fair and wild
It is a very joy
He hath conversed with sun and shower
And dwelt with every idle flower
As fresh and gay as them
He loiters with the briarrose
The bluebells are his playfellows
That dance upon their slender stem

And I have said my little Will
Why should he not continue still
A thing of Natures rearing
A thing beyond the worlds control
A living vegetable soul
No human sorrow fearing

It were a blessed sight to see
That child become a willowtree
His brother trees among
Hed be four times as tall as me
And live three times as long

Catherine M Fanshawe 17651834




ONLY SEVEN
After Wordsworth

I marvelled why a simple child
That lightly draws its breath
Should utter groans so very wild
And look as pale as death

Adopting a parental tone
I asked her why she cried
The damsel answered with a groan
Ive got a pain inside

I thought it would have sent me mad
Last night about eleven
Said I What is it makes you bad
How many apples have you had
She answered Only seven

And are you sure you took no more
My little maid quoth I
Oh please sir mother gave me four
But they were in a pie

If thats the case I stammered out
Of course youve had eleven
The maiden answered with a pout
I aint had more nor seven

I wondered hugely what she meant
And said Im bad at riddles
But I know where little girls are sent
For telling taradiddles

Now if you dont reform said I
Youll never go to heaven
But all in vain each time I try
That little idiot makes reply
I aint had more nor seven

POSTSCRIPT
To borrow Wordsworths name was wrong
Or slightly misapplied
And so Id better call my song
Lines after Acheinside

Henry Sambrooke Leigh 18371883




LUCY LAKE
After Wordsworth

Poor Lucy Lake was overgrown
But somewhat underbrained
She did not know enough I own
To go in when it rained

Yet Lucy was constrained to go
Green beddingyou infer
Few people knew she died but oh
The difference to her

Newton Mackintosh 1858




JANE SMITH
After Wordsworth

I journeyed on a winters day
Across the lonely wold
No bird did sing upon the spray
And it was very cold

I had a coach with horses four
Three white though one was black
And on they went the common oer
Nor swiftness did they lack

A little girl ran by my side
And she was pinched and thin
Oh please sir do give me a ride
Im fetching mothers gin

Enter my coach sweet child said I
For you shall ride with me
And I will get you your supply
Of mothers eaudevie

The publican was stern and cold
And said Her mothers score
Is writ as you shall soon behold
Behind the barroom door

I blotted out the score with tears
And paid the money down
And took the maid of thirteen years
Back to her mothers town

And though the past with surges wild
Fond memories may sever
The vision of that happy child
Will leave my spirits never

Rudyard Kipling 18651936




FATHER WILLIAM
From Alice in Wonderland
After Southey

You are old Father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right

In my youth Father William replied to his son
I feared it might injure the brain
But now that Im perfectly sure I have none
Why I do it again and again

You are old said the youth as I mentioned before
And have grown most uncommonly fat
Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door
Pray what is the reason of that

In my youth said the sage as he shook his gray locks
I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
Allow me to sell you a couple

You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet
Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
Pray how did you manage to do it

In my youth said his father I took to the law
And argued each case with my wife
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
Has lasted the rest of my life

You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
What made you so awfully clever

I have answered three questions and that is enough
Said his father dont give yourself airs
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff
Be off or Ill kick you downstairs

Lewis Carroll 18321898




THE NEW ARRIVAL
After Campbell

There came to port last Sunday night
The queerest little craft
Without an inch of rigging on
I looked and lookedand laughed
It seemed so curious that she
Should cross the Unknown water
And moor herself within my room
My daughter O my daughter

Yet by these presents witness all
Shes welcome fifty times
And comes consigned in hope and love
And commonmetre rhymes
She has no manifest but this
No flag floats oer the water
Shes too new for the British Lloyds
My daughter O my daughter

Ring out wild bellsand tame ones too
Ring out the lovers moon
Ring in the little worsted socks
Ring in the bib and spoon
Ring out the muse ring in the nurse
Ring in the milk and water
Away with paper pen and ink
My daughter O my daughter

George Washington Cable 18441925




DISASTER
After Moore

Twas ever thus from childhoods hour
My fondest hopes would not decay
I never loved a tree or flower
Which was the first to fade away
The garden where I used to delve
Shortfrocked still yields me pinks in plenty
The peartree that I climbed at twelve
I see still blossoming at twenty

I never nursed a dear gazelle
But I was given a paroquet
How I did nurse him if unwell
Hes imbecile but lingers yet
Hes green with an enchanting tuft
He melts me with his small black eye
Hed look inimitable stuffed
And knows itbut he will not die

I had a kittenI was rich
In petsbut all too soon my kitten
Became a fullsized cat by which
Ive more than once been scratched and bitten
And when for sleep her limbs she curled
One day beside her untouched plateful
And glided calmly from the world
I freely own that I was grateful

And then I bought a doga queen
Ah Tiny dear departing pug
She lives but she is past sixteen
And scarce can crawl across the rug
I loved her beautiful and kind
Delighted in her pert Bowwow
But now she snaps if you dont mind
Twere lunacy to love her now

I used to think should eer mishap
Betide my crumplevisaged Ti
In shape of prowling thief or trap
Or coarse bullterrierI should die
But ah disasters have their use
And life might een be too sunshiny
Nor would I make myself a goose
If some big dog should swallow Tiny

Charles Stuart Calverley 18311884




TWAS EVER THUS
After Moore

I never reared a young gazelle
Because you see I never tried
But had it known and loved me well
No doubt the creature would have died
My rich and aged Uncle John
Has known me long and loves me well
But still persists in living on
I would he were a young gazelle

I never loved a tree or flower
But if I had I beg to say
The blight the wind the sun or shower
Would soon have withered it away
Ive dearly loved my Uncle John
From childhood to the present hour
And yet he will go living on
I would he were a tree or flower

Henry Sambrooke Leigh 18371883




A GRIEVANCE
After Byron

Dear Mr Editor I wish to say
If you will not be angry at my writing it
But Ive been used since childhoods happy day
When I have thought of something to inditing it
I seldom think of things and by the way
Although this meter may not be exciting it
Enables one to be extremely terse
Which is not what one always is in verse

I used to know a mansuch things befall
The observant wayfarer through Fates domain
He was a man take him for all in all
We shall not look upon his like again
I know that statements not original
What statement is since Shakespeare or since Cain
What murder I believe twas Shakespeare said it or
Perhaps it may have been your Fighting Editor

Though why an Editor should fight or why
A Fighter should abase himself to edit
Are problems far too difficult and high
For me to solve with any sort of credit
Some greatly more accomplished man than I
Must tackle them lets say then Shakespeare said it
And if he did not Lewis Morris may
Or even if he did Some other day

When I have nothing pressing to impart
I should not mind dilating on this matter
I feel its import both in head and heart
And always didespecially the latter
I could discuss it in the busy mart
Or on the lonely housetop hold this chatter
Diverts me from my purpose To the point
The time as Hamlet said is out of joint

And perhaps I was born to set it right
A fact I greet with perfect equanimity
I do not put it down to cursed spite
I dont see any cause for cursing in it I
Have always taken very great delight
In such pursuits since first I read divinity
Whoever will may write a nations songs
As long as Im allowed to right its wrongs

Whats Eton but a nursery of wrongrighters
A mighty mother of effective men
A training ground for amateur reciters
A sharpener of the sword as of the pen
A factory of orators and fighters
A forcinghouse of genius Now and then
The world at large shrinks back abashed and beaten
Unable to endure the glare of Eton

I think I said I knew a man what then
I dont suppose such knowledge is forbid
We nearly all do more or less know men
Or think we do nor will a man get rid
Of that delusion while he wields a pen
But who this man was what if aught he did
Nor why I mentioned him I do not know
Nor what I wished to say a while ago

James Kenneth Stephen 18591892




NOT A SOU HAD HE GOT
After Charles Wolfe

Not a sou had he gotnot a guinea or note
And he looked confoundedly flurried
As he bolted away without paying his shot
And the landlady after him hurried

We saw him again at dead of night
When home from the club returning
We twigged the doctor beneath the light
Of the gaslamp brilliantly burning

All bare and exposed to the midnight dews
Reclined in a gutter we found him
And he looked like a gentleman taking a snooze
With his Marshall cloak around him

The doctors as drunk as the devil we said
And we managed a shutter to borrow
We raised him and sighed at the thought that his head
Would consumedly ache on the morrow

We bore him home and we put him to bed
And we told his wife and his daughter
To give him next morning a couple of red
Herrings with sodawater

Loudly they talked of his money thats gone
And his lady began to upbraid him
But little he recked so they let him snore on
Neath the counterpane just as we laid him

We tucked him in and had hardly done
When beneath the window calling
We heard the rough voice of a son of a gun
Of a watchman One oclock bawling

Slowly and sadly we all walked down
From his room on the uppermost story
A rushlight we placed on the cold hearthstone
And we left him alone in his glory

Richard Harris Barham 17881845




THE WHITING AND THE SNAIL
From Alice in Wonderland
After Mary Howitt

Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail
Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail
See bow eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance
Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance

You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea
But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance

What matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied
There is another shore you know upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance
Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance

Lewis Carroll 18321898




THE RECOGNITION
After Tennyson

Home they brought her sailor son
Grown a man across the sea
Tall and broad and black of beard
And hoarse of voice as man may be

Hand to shake and mouth to kiss
Both he offered ere he spoke
But she said What man is this
Comes to play a sorry joke

Then they praised himcalled him smart
Tightest lad that ever stept
But her son she did not know
And she neither smiled nor wept

Rose a nurse of ninety years
Set a pigeonpie in sight
She saw him eatTis he tis he
She knew himby his appetite

Frederick William Sawyer 18101875




THE HIGHER PANTHEISM IN A NUTSHELL
After Tennyson

One who is not we see but one whom we see not is
Surely this is not that but that is assuredly this

What and wherefore and whence for under is over and under
If thunder could be without lightning lightning could be without thunder

Doubt is faith in the main but faith on the whole is doubt
We cannot believe by proof but could we believe without

Why and whither and how for barley and rye are not clover
Neither are straight lines curves yet over is under and over

Two and two may be four but four and four are not eight
Fate and God may be twain but God is the same thing as fate

Ask a man what he thinks and get from a man what he feels
God once caught in the fact shows you a fair pair of heels

Body and spirit are twins God only knows which is which
The soul squats down in the flesh like a tinker drunk in a ditch

One and two are not one but one and nothing is two
Truth can hardly be false if falsehood cannot be true

Once the mastodon was pterodactyls were common as cocks
Then the mammoth was God now is He a prize ox

Parallels all things are yet many of these are askew
You are certainly I but certainly I am not you

Springs the rock from the plain shoots the stream from the rock
Cocks exist for the hen but hens exist for the cock

God whom we see not is and God who is not we see
Fiddle we know is diddle and diddle we take it is dee

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909




THE WILLOWTREE
After Hood

Long by the willowtrees
Vainly they sought her
Wild rang the mothers screams
Oer the gray water
Where is my lovely one
Where is my daughter

Rouse thee Sir Constable
Rouse thee and look
Fisherman bring your net
Boatman your hook
Beat in the lilybeds
Dive in the brook

Vainly the constable
Shouted and called her
Vainly the fisherman
Beat the green alder
Vainly he flung the net
Never it hauled her

Mother beside the fire
Sat her nightcap in
Father in easy chair
Gloomily napping
When at the windowsill
Came a light tapping

And a pale countenance
Looked through the casement
Loud beat the mothers heart
Sick with amazement
And at the vision which
Came to surprise her
Shrieked in an agony
Lor its Elizar

Yes twas Elizabeth
Yes twas their girl
Pale was her cheek and her
Hair out of curl
Mother the loving one
Blushing exclaimed
Let not your innocent
Lizzy be blamed

Yesterday going to Aunt
Joness to tea
Mother dear mother I
Forgot the doorkey
And as the night was cold
And the way steep
Mrs Jones kept me to
Breakfast and sleep

Whether her Pa and Ma
Fully believed her
That we shall never know
Stern they received her
And for the work of that
Cruel though short night
Sent her to bed without
Tea for a fortnight

MORAL
Hey diddle diddlety
Cat and the fiddlety
Maidens of England take caution by she
Let love and suicide
Never tempt you aside
And always remember to take the doorkey

William Makepeace Thackeray 18111863




POETS AND LINNETS
After Robert Browning

Whereer theres a thistle to feed a linnet
And linnets are plenty thistles rife
Or an acorncup to catch dewdrops in it
Theres ample promise of further life
Now mark how we begin it

For linnets will follow if linnets are minded
As blows the whitefeather parachute
And ships will reel by the tempest blinded
Aye ships and shiploads of men to boot
How deep whole fleets youll find hid

And we blow the thistledown hither and thither
Forgetful of linnets and men and God
The dew for its want an oak will wither
By the dull hoof into the dust is trod
And then who strikes the cither

But thistles were only for donkeys intended
And that donkeys are common enough is clear
And that drop what a vessel it might have befriended
Does it add any flavor to Glugabibs beer
Well theres my musing ended

Tom Hood 18351874




THE JAMPOT

The Jampottender thought
I grabbed itso did you
What wonder while we fought
Together that it flew
In shivers you retort

You should have loosed your hold
One momentchecked your fist
But as it was too bold
You grappled and you missed
More plainlyyou were sold

Well neither of us shared
 The dainty That your plea
Well neither of us cared
I answer Let me see
How have your trousers fared

Rudyard Kipling 18651936




BALLAD
After William Morris

Part I
The auld wife sat at her ivied door
Butler and eggs and a pound of cheese
A thing she had frequently done before
And her spectacles lay on her aproned knees

The piper he piped on the hilltop high
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
Till the cow said I die and the goose asked Why
And the dog said nothing but searched for fleas

The farmer he strode through the square farmyard
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
His last brew of ale was a trifle hard
The connection of which with the plot one sees

The farmers daughter hath frank blue eyes
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
She hears the rooks caw in the windy skies
As she sits at her lattice and shells her peas

The farmers daughter hath ripe red lips
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
If you try to approach her away she skips
Over tables and chairs with apparent ease

The farmers daughter hath soft brown hair
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
And I met with a ballad I cant say where
Which wholly consisted of lines like these

Part II
She sat with her hands neath her dimpled cheeks
Butler and eggs and a pound of cheese
And spake not a word While a lady speaks
There is hope but she didnt even sneeze

She sat with her hands neath her crimson cheeks
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
She gave up mending her fathers breeks
And let the cat roll in her new chemise

She sat with her hands neath her burning cheeks
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
And gazed at the piper for thirteen weeks
Then she followed him out oer the misty leas

Her sheep followed her as their tails did them
Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese
And this song is considered a perfect gem
And as to the meaning its what you please

Charles Stuart Calverley 18311884




THE POSTERGIRL
After Dante Gabriel Rossetti

The blessed Postergirl leaned out
From a pinkypurple heaven
One eye was red and one was green
Her bang was cut uneven
She had three fingers on her hand
And the hairs on her head were seven

Her robe ungirt from clasp to hem
No sunflowers did adorn
But a heavy Turkish portiere
Was very neatly worn
And the hat that lay along her back
Was yellow like canned corn

It was a kind of wobbly wave
That she was standing on
And high aloft she flung a scarf
That must have weighed a ton
And she was rather tallat least
She reached up to the sun

She curved and writhed and then she said
Less green of speech than blue
Perhaps I am absurdperhaps
I dont appeal to you
But my artistic worth depends
Upon the point of view

I saw her smile although her eyes
Were only smudgy smears
And then she swished her swirling arms
And wagged her gorgeous ears
She sobbed a blueandgreenchecked sob
And wept some purple tears

Carolyn Wells 186




AFTER DILETTANTE CONCETTI
After Dante Gabriel Rossetti

Why do you wear your hair like a man
Sister Helen
This week is the third since you began
Im writing a ballad be still if you can
Little brother
O Mother Carey mother
What chickens are these between sea and heaven

But why does your figure appear so lean
Sister Helen
And why do you dress in sage sage green
Children should never be heard if seen
Little brother
O Mother Carey mother
What fowls are awing in the stormy heaven

But why is your face so yellowy white
Sister Helen
And why are your skirts so funnily tight
Be quiet you torment or how can I write
Little brother
O Mother Carey mother
How gathers thy train to the sea from the heaven

And whos Mother Carey and what is her train
Sister Helen
And why do you call her again and again
You troublesome boy why thats the refrain
Little brother
O Mother Carey mother
What work is toward in the startled heaven

And whats a refrain What a curious word
Sister Helen
Is the ballad youre writing about a seabird
Not at all why should it be Dont be absurd
Little brother
O Mother Carey mother
Thy brood flies lower as lowers the heaven

A big brother speaketh

The refrain youve studied a meaning had
Sister Helen
It gave strange force to a weird ballad
But refrains have become a ridiculous fad
Little brother
And Mother Carey mother
Has a bearing on nothing in earth or heaven

But the finical fashion has had its day
Sister Helen
And lets try in the style of a different lay
To bid it adieu in poetical way
Little brother
So Mother Carey mother
Collect your chickens and go toheaven

A pause Then the big brother singeth accompanying himself
 in a plaintive wise on the triangle

Look in my face My name is Usedtowas
I am also called Playedout and Donetodeath
And Itwillwashnomore Awakeneth
Slowly but sure awakening it has
The commonsense of man and I alas
The balladburden trick now known too well
Am turned to scorn and grown contemptible
A too transparent artifice to pass

What a cheap dodge I am The cats who dart
Tinkettled through the streets in wild surprise
Assail judicious ears not otherwise
And yet no critics praise the urchins art
Who to the wretched creatures caudal part
Its foolish emptyjingling burden ties

Henry Duff Traill 18421900




IF
After Swinburne

If life were never bitter
And love were always sweet
Then who would care to borrow
A moral from tomorrow
If Thames would always glitter
And joy would neer retreat
If life were never bitter
And love were always sweet

If care were not the waiter
Behind a fellows chair
When easygoing sinners
Sit down to Richmond dinners
And lifes swift stream flows straighter
By Jove it would be rare
If care were not the waiter
Behind a fellows chair

If wit were always radiant
And wine were always iced
And bores were kicked out straightway
Through a convenient gateway
Then down the years long gradient
Twere sad to be enticed
If wit were always radiant
And wine were always iced

Mortimer Collins 18271876




NEPHELIDIA
After Swinburne

From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through
 a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine
Pallid and pink as the palm of the flagflower that flickers
 with fear of the flies as they float
Are the looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of
 mystic miraculous moonshine
These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and
 threaten with throbs through the throat
Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actors
 appalled agitation
Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the
 promise of pride in the past
Flushed with the famishing fulness of fever that reddens with
 radiance of rathe recreation
Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom
 of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast

Nay for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on
 the temples of terror
Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who
 is dumb as the dustheaps of death
Surely no soul is it sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional
 exquisite error
Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss beatific itself by
 beatitudes breath
Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit
 and soul of our senses
Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the
 semblance and sound of a sigh
Only this oracle opens Olympian in mystical moods and triangular tenses
Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn
 of the day when we die

Mild is the mirk and monotonous music of memory melodiously mute
 as it may be
While the hope in the heart of a hero is bruised by the breach of
 mens rapiers resigned to the rod
Made meek as a mother whose bosombeats bound with the blissbringing
 bulk of a balmbreathing baby
As they grope through the graveyard of creeds under skies growing
 green at a groan for the grimness of God
Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old and its binding
 is blacker than bluer
Out of blue into black is the scheme of the skies and their dews
 are the wine of the bloodshed of things
Till the darkling desire of delight shall be free as a fawn that
 is freed from the fangs that pursue her
Till the heartbeats of hell shall be hushed by a hymn from the
 hunt that has harried the kennel of kings

Algernon Charles Swinburne 18371909




COMMONPLACES
After Heine

Rain on the face of the sea
Rain on the sodden land
And the windowpane is blurred with rain
As I watch it pen in hand

Mist on the face of the sea
Mist on the sodden land
Filling the vales as daylight fails
And blotting the desolate sand

Voices from out of the mist
Calling to one another
Hath love an end thou more than friend
Thou dearer than ever brother

Voices from out of the mist
Calling and passing away
But I cannot speak for my voice is weak
And this is the end of my lay

Rudyard Kipling 18651936




THE PROMISSORY NOTE
After Poe

In the lonesome latter years
Fatal years
To the dropping of my tears
Danced the mad and mystic spheres
In a rounded reeling rune
Neath the moon
To the dripping and the dropping of my tears
Ah my soul is swathed in gloom
Ulalume
In a dim Titanic tomb
For my gaunt and gloomy soul
Ponders oer the penal scroll
Oer the parchment not a rhyme
Out of placeout of time
I am shredded shorn unshifty
Oh the fifty
And the days have passed the three
Over me
And the debit and the credit are as one to him and me

Twas the random runes I wrote
At the bottom of the note
Wrote and freely
Gave to Greeley
In the middle of the night
In the mellow moonless night
When the stars were out of sight
When my pulses like a knell
Israfel
Danced with dim and dying fays
Oer the ruins of my days
Oer the dimeless timeless days
When the fifty drawn at thirty
Seeming thrifty yet the dirty
Lucre of the market was the most that I could raise

Fiends controlled it
Let him hold it
Devils held me for the inkstand and the pen
Now the days of grace are oer
Ah Lenore
I am but as other men
What is time time time
To my rare and runic rhyme
To my random reeling rhyme
By the sands along the shore
Where the tempest whispers Pay him and I answer
Nevermore

Bayard Taylor 18251878




MRS JUDGE JENKINS
Being The Only Genuine Sequel To Maud Muller
After Whittier

Maud Muller all that summer day
Raked the meadow sweet with hay

Yet looking down the distant lane
She hoped the Judge would come again

But when he came with smile and bow
Maud only blushed and stammered Haow

And spoke of her pa and wondered whether
Hed give consent they should wed together

Old Muller burst in tears and then
Begged that the Judge would lend him ten

For trade was dull and wages low
And the craps this year were somewhat slow

And ere the languid summer died
Sweet Maud became the Judges bride

But on the day that they were mated
Mauds brother Bob was intoxicated

And Mauds relations twelve in all
Were very drunk at the Judges hall

And when the summer came again
The young bride bore him babies twain

And the Judge was blest but thought it strange
That bearing children made such a change

For Maud grew broad and red and stout
And the waist that his arm once clasped about

Was more than he now could span and he
Sighed as he pondered ruefully

How that which in Maud was native grace
In Mrs Jenkins was out of place

And thought of the twins and wished that they
Looked less like the men who raked the hay

On Mullers farm and dreamed with pain
Of the day he wandered down the lane

And looking down that dreary track
He half regretted that he came back

For had he waited he might have wed
Some maiden fair and thoroughbred

For there be women as fair as she
Whose verbs and nouns do more agree

Alas for maiden alas for judge
And the sentimentalthats onehalf fudge

For Maud soon thought the Judge a bore
With all his learning and all his lore

And the Judge would have bartered Mauds fair face
For more refinement and social grace

If of all words of tongue and pen
The saddest are It might have been

More sad are these we daily see
It is but hadnt ought to be

Bret Harte 18391902




THE MODERN HIAWATHA
From The Song of Milkanwatha

He killed the noble Mudjokivis
With the skin he made him mittens
Made them with the fur side inside
Made them with the skin side outside
He to get the warm side inside
Put the inside skin side outside
He to get the cold side outside
Put the warm side fur side inside
Thats why he put the fur side inside
Why he put the skin side outside
Why he turned them inside outside

George A Strong 18321912




HOW OFTEN
After Longfellow

They stood on the bridge at midnight
In a park not far from the town
They stood on the bridge at midnight
Because they didnt sit down

The moon rose oer the city
Behind the dark church spire
The moon rose oer the city
And kept on rising higher

How often oh how often
They whispered words so soft
How often oh how often
How often oh how oft

Ben King 18571894




IF I SHOULD DIE TONIGHT
After Arabella Eugenia Smith

If I should die tonight
And you should come to my cold corpse and say
Weeping and heartsick oer my lifeless clay
If I should die tonight
And you should come in deepest grief and woe
And say Heres that ten dollars that I owe
I might arise in my large white cravat
And say Whats that

If I should die tonight
And you should come to my cold corpse and kneel
Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel
I say if I should die tonight
And you should come to me and there and then
Just even hint at paying me that ten
I might arise the while
But Id drop dead again

Ben King 18571894




SINCERE FLATTERY
Of W W Americanus

The clear cool note of the cuckoo which has ousted the legitimate
 nestholder
The whistle of the railway guard dispatching the train to the
 inevitable collision
The maidens monosyllabic reply to a polysyllabic proposal
The fundamental note of the last trump which is presumably D natural
All of these are sounds to rejoice in yea to let your very ribs
 reecho with
But better than all of them is the absolutely last chord of the
 apparently inexhaustible pianoforte player

James Kenneth Stephen 18591892

Look sharp ses she with them there sossiges
Yea sharp with them there bags of mysteree
For lo she ses for lo old pal ses she

THE POETS AT TEA

IMacaulay
Pour varlet pour the water
The water steaming hot
A spoonful for each man of us
Another for the pot
We shall not drink from amber
No Capuan slave shall mix
For us the snows of Athos
With port at thirtysix
Whiter than snow the crystals
Grown sweet neath tropic fires
More rich the herb of Chinas field
The pasturelands more fragrance yield
Forever let Britannia wield
The teapot of her sires

IITennyson
I think that I am drawing to an end
For on a sudden came a gasp for breath
And stretching of the hands and blinded eyes
And a great darkness falling on my soul
O Hallelujah Kindly pass the milk

IIISwinburne
As the sin that was sweet in the sinning
Is foul in the ending thereof
As the heat of the summers beginning
Is past in the winter of love
O purity painful and pleading
O coldness ineffably gray
O hear us our handmaid unheeding
And take it away

IVCowper
The cosy fire is bright and gay
The merry kettle boils away
And hums a cheerful song
I sing the saucer and the cup
Pray Mary fill the teapot up
And do not make it strong

VBrowning
Tut Bah We take as another case
Pass the pills on the windowsill notice the capsule
A sick mans fancy no doubt but I place
Reliance on trademarks Sirso perhaps youll
Excuse the digressionthis cup which I hold
LightpoisedBah its spilt in the bedwell lets on go
Hold Bohea and sugar Sir if you were told
The sugar was salt would the Bohea be Congo

VIWordsworth
Come little cottage girl you seem
To want my cup of tea
And will you take a little cream
Now tell the truth to me

She had a rustic woodland grin
Her cheek was soft as silk
And she replied Sir please put in
A little drop of milk

Why what put milk into your head
Tis cream my cows supply
And five times to the child I said
Why pighead tell me why

You call me pighead she replied
My proper name is Ruth
I called that milkshe blushed with pride
You bade me speak the truth

VIIPoe
Heres a mellow cup of teagolden tea
What a world of rapturous thought its fragrance brings to me
Oh from out the silver cells
How it wells
How it smells
Keeping tune tune tune
To the tintinnabulation of the spoon
And the kettle on the fire
Boils its spout off with desire
With a desperate desire
And a crystalline endeavor
Now now to sit or never
On the top of the palefaced moon
But he always came home to tea tea tea tea tea
Tea to the nth

VIIIRossetti
The lilies lie in my ladys bower
O weary mother drive the cows to roost
They faintly droop for a little hour
My ladys head droops like a flower

She took the porcelain in her hand
O weary mother drive the cows to roost
She poured I drank at her command
Drank deep and nowyou understand
O weary mother drive the cows to roost

IXBurns
Weel gin ye speir Im no inclined
Whusky or tayto state my mind
Fore ane or ither
For gin I tak the first Im fou
And gin the next Im dull as you
Mix a thegither

XWalt Whitman
One cup for my selfhood
Many for you Allons camerados we will drink together
O handinhand That teaspoon please when youve done with it
What buttercolored hair youve got I dont want to be personal
All right then you neednt Youre a stalecadaver
Eighteenpence if the bottles are returned
Allons from all bateyed formulas

Barry Pain 18641928




WORDSWORTH

Two voices are there one is of the deep
It learns the storm clouds thunderous melody
Now roars now murmurs with the changing sea
Now birdlike pipes now closes soft in sleep
And one is of an old halfwitted sheep
Which bleats articulate monotony
And indicates that two and one are three
That grass is green lakes damp and mountains steep
And Wordsworth both are thine at certain times
Forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes
The form and pressure of high thoughts will burst
At other timesgood Lord Id rather be
Quite unacquainted with the A B C
Than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst

James Kenneth Stephen 18591892
