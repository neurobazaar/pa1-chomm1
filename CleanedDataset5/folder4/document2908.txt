The action takes place on February 7th between the hours of noon and
six in the afternoon close to the Trenartha Tin Plate Works on the
borders of England and Wales where a strike has been in progress
throughout the winter





ACT I


 It is noon In the Underwoods diningroom a bright fire is
 burning On one side of the fireplace are doubledoors leading
 to the drawingroom on the other side a door leading to the
 hall In the centre of the room a long diningtable without a
 cloth is set out as a Board table At the head of it in the
 Chairmans seat sits JOHN ANTHONY an old man big
 cleanshaven and highcoloured with thick white hair and thick
 dark eyebrows His movements are rather slow and feeble but his
 eyes are very much alive There is a glass of water by his side
 On his right sits his son EDGAR an earnestlooking man of thirty
 reading a newspaper Next him WANKLIN a man with jutting
 eyebrows and silverstreaked light hair is bending over transfer
 papers TENCH the Secretary a short and rather humble nervous
 man with side whiskers stands helping him On WANKLINS right
 sits UNDERWOOD the Manager a quiet man with along stiff jaw
 and steady eyes Back to the fire is SCANTLEBURY a very large
 pale sleepy man with grey hair rather bald Between him and
 the Chairman are two empty chairs

WILDER Who is lean cadaverous and complaining with drooping
grey moustaches stands before the fire I say this fires the
devil Can I have a screen Tench

SCANTLEBURY A screen ah

TENCH Certainly Mr Wilder He looks at UNDERWOOD That is
perhaps the Managerperhaps Mr Underwood

SCANTLEBURY These fireplaces of yours Underwood

UNDERWOOD Roused from studying some papers A screen Rather
Im sorry He goes to the door with a little smile Were not
accustomed to complaints of too much fire down here just now

 He speaks as though he holds a pipe between his teeth slowly
 ironically

WILDER In an injured voice You mean the men Hm

 UNDERWOOD goes out

SCANTLEBURY Poor devils

WILDER Its their own fault Scantlebury

EDGAR Holding out his paper Theres great distress among them
according to the Trenartha News

WILDER Oh that rag Give it to Wanklin Suit his Radical views
They call us monsters I suppose The editor of that rubbish ought
to be shot

EDGAR Reading If the Board of worthy gentlemen who control the
Trenartha Tin Plate Works from their armchairs in London would
condescend to come and see for themselves the conditions prevailing
amongst their workpeople during this strike

WILDER Well we have come

EDGAR Continuing We cannot believe that even their legofmutton
hearts would remain untouched

 WANKLIN takes the paper from him

WILDER Ruffian I remember that fellow when he had nt a penny to
his name little snivel of a chap thats made his way by blackguarding
everybody who takes a different view to himself

 ANTHONY says something that is not heard

WILDER What does your father say

EDGAR He says The kettle and the pot

WILDER Hm

 He sits down next to SCANTLEBURY

SCANTLEBURY Blowing out his cheeks I shall boil if I dont get
that screen

 UNDERWOOD and ENID enter with a screen which they place before
 the fire ENID is tall she has a small decided face and is
 twentyeight years old

ENID Put it closer Frank Will that do Mr Wilder Its the
highest weve got

WILDER Thanks capitally

SCANTLEBURY Turning with a sigh of pleasure Ah Merci
Madame

ENID Is there anything else you want Father ANTHONY shakes his
head Edgaranything

EDGAR You might give me a J nib old girl

ENID There are some down there by Mr Scantlebury

SCANTLEBURY Handing a little box of nibs Ah your brother uses
Js What does the manager use With expansive politeness
What does your husband use Mrs Underwood

UNDERWOOD A quill

SCANTLEBURY The homely product of the goose He holds out
quills

UNDERWOOD Drily Thanks if you can spare me one He takes a
quill What about lunch Enid

ENID Stopping at the doubledoors and looking back Were going
to have lunch here in the drawingroom so you need nt hurry with
your meeting

 WANKLIN and WILDER bow and she goes out

SCANTLEBURY Rousing himself suddenly Ah Lunch That hotel
Dreadful Did you try the whitebait last night Fried fat

WILDER Past twelve Are nt you going to read the minutes Tench

TENCH Looking for the CHAIRMANS assent reads in a rapid and
monotonous voice At a Board Meeting held the 31st of January at
the Companys Offices 512 Cannon Street EC PresentMr Anthony
in the chair Messrs F H Wilder William Scantlebury Oliver
Wanklin and Edgar Anthony Read letters from the Manager dated
January 20th 23d 25th 28th relative to the strike at the
Companys Works Read letters to the Manager of January 21st 24th
26th 29th Read letter from Mr Simon Harness of the Central
Union asking for an interview with the Board Read letter from the
Mens Committee signed David Roberts James Green John Bulgin
Henry Thomas George Rous desiring conference with the Board and it
was resolved that a special Board Meeting be called for February 7th
at the house of the Manager for the purpose of discussing the
situation with Mr Simon Harness and the Mens Committee on the spot
Passed twelve transfers signed and sealed nine certificates and one
balance certificate

He pushes the book over to the CHAIRMAN

ANTHONY With a heavy sigh If its your pleasure sign the same

 He signs moving the pen with difficulty 

WANKLIN Whats the Unions game Tench They have nt made up
their split with the men What does Harness want this interview for

TENCH Hoping we shall come to a compromise I think sir hes
having a meeting with the men this afternoon

WILDER Harness Ah Hes one of those coldblooded coolheaded
chaps I distrust them I dont know that we didnt make a mistake
to come down What timell the men be here

UNDERWOOD Any time now

WILDER Well if were not ready theyll have to waitwont do
them any harm to cool their heels a bit

SCANTLEBURY Slowly Poor devils Its snowing What weather

UNDERWOOD With meaning slowness This housell be the warmest
place theyve been in this winter

WILDER Well I hope were going to settle this business in time for
me to catch the 630 Ive got to take my wife to Spain tomorrow
Chattily My old father had a strike at his works in 69 just
such a February as this They wanted to shoot him

WANKLIN What In the close season

WILDER By George there was no close season for employers then He
used to go down to his office with a pistol in his pocket

SCANTLEBURY Faintly alarmed Not seriously

WILDER With finality Ended in his shootin one of em in the
legs

SCANTLEBURY Unavoidably feeling his thigh No Which

ANTHONY Lifting the agenda paper To consider the policy of the
Board in relation to the strike There is a silence

WILDER Its this infernal threecornered duelthe Union the men
and ourselves

WANKLIN We need nt consider the Union

WILDER Its my experience that youve always got to consider the
Union confound them If the Union were going to withdraw their
support from the men as theyve done why did they ever allow them
to strike at all

EDGAR Weve had that over a dozen times

WILDER Well Ive never understood it Its beyond me They talk
of the engineers and furnacemens demands being excessiveso they
arebut thats not enough to make the Union withdraw their support
Whats behind it

UNDERWOOD Fear of strikes at Harpers and Tinewells

WILDER With triumph Afraid of other strikesnow thats a
reason Why could nt we have been told that before

UNDERWOOD You were

TENCH You were absent from the Board that day sir

SCANTLEBURY The men must have seen they had no chance when the
Union gave them up Its madness

UNDERWOOD Its Roberts

WILDER Just our luck the men finding a fanatical firebrand like
Roberts for leader A pause

WANKLIN Looking at ANTHONY Well

WILDER Breaking in fussily Its a regular mess I dont like
the position were in I dont like it Ive said so for a long time
Looking at WANKLIN When Wanklin and I came down here before
Christmas it looked as if the men must collapse You thought so too
Underwood

UNDERWOOD Yes

WILDER Well they havent Here we are going from bad to worse
losing our customersshares going down

SCANTLEBURY Shaking his head Mm Mm

WANKLIN What loss have we made by this strike Tench

TENCH Over fifty thousand sir

SCANTLEBURY Pained You dont say

WILDER We shall never got it back

TENCH No sir

WILDER Whod have supposed the men were going to stick out like
thisnobody suggested that Looking angrily at TENCH

SCANTLEBURY Shaking his head Ive never liked a fightnever
shall

ANTHONY No surrender All look at him

WILDER Who wants to surrender ANTHONY looks at him II want
to act reasonably When the men sent Roberts up to the Board in
Decemberthen was the time We ought to have humoured him instead
of that the ChairmanDropping his eyes before ANTHONYSerwe
snapped his head off We could have got them in then by a little
tact

ANTHONY No compromise

WILDER There we are This strikes been going on now since
October and as far as I can see it may last another six months
Pretty mess we shall be in by then The only comfort is the menll
be in a worse

EDGAR To UNDERWOOD What sort of state are they really in
Frank

UNDERWOOD Without expression Damnable

WILDER Well who on earth would have thought theyd have held on
like this without support

UNDERWOOD Those who know them

WILDER I defy any one to know them And what about tin Price
going up daily When we do get started we shall have to work off our
contracts at the top of the market

WANKLIN What do you say to that Chairman

ANTHONY Cant be helped

WILDER Shant pay a dividend till goodness knows when

SCANTLEBURY With emphasis We ought to think of the
shareholders Turning heavily Chairman I say we ought to think
of the shareholders ANTHONY mutters

SCANTLEBURY Whats that

TENCH The Chairman says he is thinking of you sir

SCANTLEBURY Sinking back into torpor Cynic

WILDER Its past a joke I dont want to go without a dividend for
years if the Chairman does We cant go on playing ducks and drakes
with the Companys prosperity

EDGAR Rather ashamedly I think we ought to consider the men

 All but ANTHONY fidget in their seats

SCANTLEBURY With a sigh We must nt think of our private
feelings young man Thatll never do

EDGAR Ironically Im not thinking of our feelings Im
thinking of the mens

WILDER As to thatwere men of business

WANKLIN That is the little trouble

EDGAR Theres no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of
all this sufferingitsits cruel

 No one speaks as though EDGAR had uncovered something whose
 existence no man prizing his selfrespect could afford to
 recognise

WANKLIN With an ironical smile Im afraid we must nt base our
policy on luxuries like sentiment

EDGAR I detest this state of things

ANTHONY We did nt seek the quarrel

EDGAR I know that sir but surely weve gone far enough

ANTHONY No All look at one another

WANKLIN Luxuries apart Chairman we must look out what were
doing

ANTHONY Give way to the men once and therell be no end to it

WANKLIN I quite agree but

 ANTHONY Shakes his head

You make it a question of bedrock principle

 ANTHONY nods

Luxuries again Chairman The shares are below par

WILDER Yes and theyll drop to a half when we pass the next
dividend

SCANTLEBURY With alarm Come come Not so bad as that

WILDER Grimly Youll see Craning forward to catch ANTHONYS
speech I didnt catch

TENCH Hesitating The Chairman says sir Fais quequedevra

EDGAR Sharply My father says Do what we oughtand let things
rip

WILDER Tcha

SCANTLEBURY Throwing up his hands The Chairmans a StoicI
always said the Chairman was a Stoic

WILDER Much good thatll do us

WANKLIN Suavely Seriously Chairman are you going to let the
ship sink under you for the sake ofa principle

ANTHONY She wont sink

SCANTLEBURY With alarm Not while Im on the Board I hope

ANTHONY With a twinkle Better rat Scantlebury

SCANTLEBURY What a man

ANTHONY Ive always fought them Ive never been beaten yet

WANKLIN Were with you in theory Chairman But were not all made
of castiron

ANTHONY Weve only to hold on

WILDER Rising and going to the fire And go to the devil as fast
as we can

ANTHONY Better go to the devil than give in

WILDER Fretfully That may suit you sir but it does nt suit
me or any one else I should think

 ANTHONY looks him in the facea silence

EDGAR I dont see how we can get over it that to go on like this
means starvation to the mens wives and families

 WILDER turns abruptly to the fire and SCANTLEBURY puts out a
 hand to push the idea away

WANKLIN Im afraid again that sounds a little sentimental

EDGAR Men of business are excused from decency you think

WILDER Nobodys more sorry for the men than I am but if they
lashing himself choose to be such a pigheaded lot its nothing
to do with us weve quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves
and the shareholders

EDGAR Irritably It wont kill the shareholders to miss a
dividend or two I dont see that thats reason enough for knuckling
under

SCANTLEBURY With grave discomfort You talk very lightly of your
dividends young man I dont know where we are

WILDER Theres only one sound way of looking at it We cant go on
ruining ourselves with this strike

ANTHONY No caving in

SCANTLEBURY With a gesture of despair Look at him

 ANTHONYS leaning back in his chair They do look at him

WILDER Returning to his seat Well all I can say is if thats
the Chairmans view I dont know what weve come down here for

ANTHONY To tell the men that weve got nothing for them
Grimly They wont believe it till they hear it spoken in plain
English

WILDER Hm Shouldnt be a bit surprised if that brute Roberts had
nt got us down here with the very same idea I hate a man with a
grievance

EDGAR Resentfully We didnt pay him enough for his discovery
I always said that at the time

WILDER We paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three
years later If thats not enough What does he want for goodness
sake

TENCH Complainingly Company made a hundred thousand out of his
brains and paid him seven hundredthats the way he goes on sir

WILDER The mans a rank agitator Look here I hate the Unions
But now weve got Harness here lets get him to settle the whole
thing

ANTHONY No Again they look at him

UNDERWOOD Roberts wont let the men assent to that

SCANTLEBURY Fanatic Fanatic

WILDER Looking at ANTHONY And not the only one FROST enters
from the hall

FROST To ANTHONY Mr Harness from the Union waiting sir The
men are here too sir

 ANTHONY nods UNDERWOOD goes to the door returning with
 HARNESS a pale cleanshaven man with hollow cheeks quick
 eyes and lantern jawFROST has retired

UNDERWOOD Pointing to TENCHS chair Sit there next the
Chairman Harness wont you

 At HARNESSS appearance the Board have drawn together as it
 were and turned a little to him like cattle at a dog

HARNESS With a sharp look round and a bow Thanks He sits
his accent is slightly nasal Well gentlemen were going to do
business at last I hope

WILDER Depends on what you call business Harness Why dont you
make the men come in

HARNESS Sardonically The men are far more in the right than you
are The question with us is whether we shant begin to support them
again

 He ignores them all except ANTHONY to whom he turns in
 speaking

ANTHONY Support them if you like well put in free labour and have
done with it

HARNESS That wont do Mr Anthony You cant get free labour and
you know it

ANTHONY We shall see that

HARNESS Im quite frank with you We were forced to withhold our
support from your men because some of their demands are in excess of
current rates I expect to make them withdraw those demands today
if they do take it straight from me gentlemen we shall back them
again at once Now I want to see something fixed upon before I go
back tonight Cant we have done with this oldfashioned tugofwar
business What goods it doing you Why dont you recognise once
for all that these people are men like yourselves and want whats
good for them just as you want whats good for you Bitterly Your
motorcars and champagne and eightcourse dinners

ANTHONY If the men will come in well do something for them

HARNESS Ironically Is that your opinion too sirand yours
and yours The Directors do not answer Well all I can say is
Its a kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone I thought wed grown
out ofseems I was mistaken

ANTHONY Its the tone the men use Remains to be seen which can
hold out longestthey without us or we without them

HARNESS As business men I wonder youre not ashamed of this waste
of force gentlemen You know what itll all end in

ANTHONY What

HARNESS Compromiseit always does

SCANTLEBURY Cant you persuade the men that their interests are the
same as ours

HARNESS Turning ironically I could persuade them of that sir
if they were

WILDER Come Harness youre a clever man you dont believe all
the Socialistic claptrap thats talked nowadays There s no real
difference between their interests and ours

HARNESS Theres just one very simple question Id like to put to
you Will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay
them

 WILDER is silent

WANKLIN Chiming in I humbly thought that not to pay more than
was necessary was the A B C of commerce

HARNESS With irony Yes that seems to be the A B C of commerce
sir and the A B C of commerce is between your interests and the
mens

SCANTLEBURY Whispering We ought to arrange something

HARNESS Drily Am I to understand then gentlemen that your
Board is going to make no concessions

 WANKLIN and WILDER bend forward as if to speak but stop

ANTHONY Nodding None

 WANKLIN and WILDER again bend forward and SCANTLEBURY gives an
 unexpected grunt

HARNESS You were about to say something I believe

 But SCANTLEBURY says nothing

EDGAR Looking up suddenly Were sorry for the state of the men

HARNESS Icily The men have no use for your pity sir What
they want is justice

ANTHONY Then let them be just

HARNESS For that word just read humble Mr Anthony Why
should they be humble Barring the accident of money are nt they
as good men as you

ANTHONY Cant

HARNESS Well Ive been five years in America It colours a mans
notions

SCANTLEBURY Suddenly as though avenging his uncompleted grunt
Lets have the men in and hear what theyve got to say

 ANTHONY nods and UNDERWOOD goes out by the single door

HARNESS Drily As Im to have an interview with them this
afternoon gentlemen I ll ask you to postpone your final decision
till thats over

 Again ANTHONY nods and taking up his glass drinks

 UNDERWOOD comes in again followed by ROBERTS GREEN BULGIN
 THOMAS ROUS They file in hat in hand and stand silent in a
 row ROBERTS is lean of middle height with a slight stoop
 He has a little ratgnawn browngrey beard moustaches high
 cheekbones hollow cheeks small fiery eyes He wears an old
 and greasestained blue serge suit and carries an old bowler
 hat He stands nearest the Chairman GREEN next to him has a
 clean worn face with a small grey goatee beard and drooping
 moustaches iron spectacles and mild straightforward eyes He
 wears an overcoat green with age and a linen collar Next to
 him is BULGIN a tall strong man with a dark moustache and
 fighting jaw wearing a red muffler who keeps changing his cap
 from one hand to the other Next to him is THOMAS an old man
 with a grey moustache full beard and weatherbeaten bony face
 whose overcoat discloses a lean pluckedlooking neck On his
 right ROUS the youngest of the five looks like a soldier he
 has a glitter in his eyes

UNDERWOOD Pointing There are some chairs there against the
wall Roberts wont you draw them up and sit down

ROBERTS Thank you Mr Underwoodwell stand in the presence of
the Board He speaks in a biting and staccato voice rolling his
rs pronouncing his as like an Italian a and his consonants short
and crisp How are you Mr Harness Did nt expect t have the
pleasure of seeing you till this afternoon

HARNESS Steadily We shall meet again then Roberts

ROBERTS Glad to hear that we shall have some news for you to take
to your people

ANTHONY What do the men want

ROBERTS Acidly Beg pardon I dont quite catch the Chairmans
remark

TENCH From behind the Chairmans chair The Chairman wishes to
know what the men have to say

ROBERTS Its what the Board has to say weve come to hear Its
for the Board to speak first

ANTHONY The Board has nothing to say

ROBERTS Looking along the line of men In that case were
wasting the Directors time Well be taking our feet off this
pretty carpet

 He turns the men move slowly as though hypnotically
 influenced

WANKLIN Suavely Come Roberts you did nt give us this long
cold journey for the pleasure of saying that

THOMAS A pure Welshman No sir an what I say iss

ROBERTSBitingly Go on Henry Thomas go on You re better able
to speak to theDirectors than me THOMAS is silent

TENCH The Chairman means Roberts that it was the men who asked
for the conference the Board wish to hear what they have to say

ROBERTS Gad If I was to begin to tell ye all they have to say I
wouldnt be finished today And thered be some thatd wish theyd
never left their London palaces

HARNESS Whats your proposition man Be reasonable

ROBERTS You want reason Mr Harness Take a look round this
afternoon before the meeting He looks at the men no sound escapes
them Youll see some very pretty scenery

HARNESS All right my friend you wont put me off

ROBERTS To the men We shant put Mr Harness off Have some
champagne with your lunch Mr Harness youll want it sir

HARNESS Come get to business man

THOMAS What were asking look you is just simple justice

ROBERTS Venomously Justice from London What are you talking
about Henry Thomas Have you gone silly THOMAS is silent We
know very well what we arediscontented dogsnever satisfied What
did the Chairman tell me up in London That I did nt know what I
was talking about I was a foolish uneducated man that knew
nothing of the wants of the men I spoke for

EDGAR Do please keep to the point

ANTHONY Holding up his hand There can only be one master
Roberts

ROBERTS Then be Gad itll be us

 There is a silence ANTHONY and ROBERTS stare at one another

UNDERWOOD If youve nothing to say to the Directors Roberts
perhaps you ll let Green or Thomas speak for the men

 GREEN and THOMAS look anxiously at ROBERTS at each other and
 the other men

GREEN An Englishman If Id been listened to gentlemen

THOMAS What Ife got to say iss what wefe all got to say

ROBERTS Speak for yourself Henry Thomas

SCANTLEBURY With a gesture of deep spiritual discomfort Let the
poor men call their souls their own

ROBERTS Aye they shall keep their souls for its not much body
that youve left them Mr with biting emphasis as though the word
were an offence Scantlebury To the men Well will you speak
or shall I speak for you

ROUS Suddenly Speak out Roberts or leave it to others

ROBERTS Ironically Thank you George Rous Addressing himself
to ANTHONY The Chairman and Board of Directors have honoured us by
leaving London and coming all this way to hear what weve got to say
it would not be polite to keep them any longer waiting

WILDER Well thank God for that

ROBERTS Ye will not dare to thank Him when I have done Mr Wilder
for all your piety May be your God up in London has no time to
listen to the working man Im told He is a wealthy God but if he
listens to what I tell Him He will know more than ever He learned in
Kensington

HARNESS Come Roberts you have your own God Respect the God of
other men

ROBERTS Thats right sir We have another God down here I doubt
He is rather different to Mr Wilders Ask Henry Thomas he will
tell you whether his God and Mr Wilders are the same

 THOMAS lifts his hand and cranes his head as though to
 prophesy

WANKLIN For goodness sake let s keep to the point Roberts

ROBERTS I rather think it is the point Mr Wanklin If you can
get the God of Capital to walk through the streets of Labour and pay
attention to what he sees youre a brighter man than I take you for
for all that youre a Radical

ANTHONY Attend to me Roberts Roberts is silent You are here
to speak for the men as I am here to speak for the Board

 He looks slowly round

 WILDER WANKLIN and SCANTLEBURY make movements of uneasiness
 and EDGAR gazes at the floor A faint smile comes on HARNESSS
 face

Now then what is it

ROBERTS Right Sir

 Throughout all that follows he and ANTHONY look fixedly upon
 each other Men and Directors show in their various ways
 suppressed uneasiness as though listening to words that they
 themselves would not have spoken

The men cant afford to travel up to London and they dont trust you
to believe what they say in black and white They know what the post
is he darts a look at UNDERWOOD and TENCH and what Directors
meetings are Refer it to the managerlet the manager advise us on
the mens condition Can we squeeze them a little more

UNDERWOOD In a low voice Dont hit below the belt Roberts

ROBERTS Is it below the belt Mr Underwood The men know When I
came up to London I told you the position straight An what came
of it I was told I did nt know what I was talkin about I cant
afford to travel up to London to be told that again

ANTHONY What have you to say for the men

ROBERTS I have this to sayand first as to their condition Ye
shall ave no need to go and ask your manager Ye cant squeeze them
any more Every man of us is wellnigh starving A surprised
murmur rises from the men ROBERTS looks round Ye wonder why I
tell ye that Every man of us is going short We cant be no worse
off than weve been these weeks past Ye need nt think that by
waiting yell drive us to come in Well die first the whole lot of
us The men have sent for ye to know once and for all whether ye
are going to grant them their demands I see the sheet of paper in
the Secretarys hand TENCH moves nervously Thats it I think
Mr Tench Its not very large

TENCH Nodding Yes

ROBERTS Theres not one sentence of writing on that paper that we
can do without

 A movement amongst the men ROBERTS turns on them sharply

Isnt that so

 The men assent reluctantly ANTHONY takes from TENCH the paper
 and peruses it

Not one single sentence All those demands are fair We have not
asked anything that we are not entitled to ask What I said up in
London I say again now there is not anything on that piece of paper
that a just man should not ask and a just man give

 A pause

ANTHONY There is not one single demand on this paper that we will
grant

 In the stir that follows on these words ROBERTS watches the
 Directors and ANTHONY the men WILDER gets up abruptly and goes
 over to the fire

ROBERTS D ye mean that

ANTHONY I do

 WILDER at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust

ROBERTS Noting it with dry intensity Ye best know whether the
condition of the Company is any better than the condition of the men
Scanning the Directors faces Ye best know whether ye can afford
your tyrannybut this I tell ye If ye think the men will give way
the least part of an inch yere making the worst mistake ye ever
made He fixes his eyes on SCANTLEBURY Ye think because the
Union is not supporting usmore shame to itthat well be coming
on our knees to you one fine morning Ye think because the men have
got their wives an families to think ofthat its just a question
of a week or two

ANTHONY It would be better if you did not speculate so much on what
we think

ROBERTS Aye Its not much profit to us I will say this for you
Mr Anthonyye know your own mind Staying at ANTHONY I can
reckon on ye

ANTHONY Ironically I am obliged to you

ROBERTS And I know mine I tell ye this The men will send their
wives and families where the country will have to keep them an they
will starve sooner than give way I advise ye Mr Anthony to
prepare yourself for the worst that can happen to your Company We
are not so ignorant as you might suppose We know the way the cat is
jumping Your position is not all that it might benot exactly

ANTHONY Be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for
ourselves Go back and reconsider your own

ROBERTS Stepping forward Mr Anthony you are not a young man
now from the time I remember anything ye have been an enemy to every
man that has come into your works I dont say that yere a mean
man or a cruel man but yeve grudged them the say of any word in
their own fate Yeve fought them down four times Ive heard ye
say ye love a fightmark my wordsyere fighting the last fight
yell ever fight

 TENCH touches ROBERTSS sleeve

UNDERWOOD Roberts Roberts

ROBERTS Roberts Roberts I must nt speak my mind to the
Chairman but the Chairman may speak his mind to me

WILDER What are things coming to

ANTHONY With a grim smile at WILDER Go on Roberts say what you
like

ROBERTS After a pause I have no more to say

ANTHONY The meeting stands adjourned to five oclock

WANKLIN In a low voice to UNDERWOOD We shall never settle
anything like this

ROBERTS Bitingly We thank the Chairman and Board of Directors
for their gracious hearing

 He moves towards the door the men cluster together stupefied
 then ROUS throwing up his head passes ROBERTS and goes out
 The others follow

ROBERTS With his hand on the doormaliciously Good day
gentlemen He goes out

HARNESS Ironically I congratulate you on the conciliatory
spirit thats been displayed With your permission gentlemen Ill
be with you again at halfpast five Good morning

 He bows slightly rests his eyes on ANTHONY who returns his
 stare unmoved and followed by UNDERWOOD goes out There is a
 moment of uneasy silence UNDERWOOD reappears in the doorway

WILDER With emphatic disgust Well

 The doubledoors are opened

ENID Standing in the doorway Lunch is ready

 EDGAR getting up abruptly walks out past his sister

WILDER Coming to lunch Scantlebury

SCANTLEBURY Rising heavily I suppose so I suppose so Its
the only thing we can do

 They go out through the doubledoors

WANKLIN In a low voice Do you really mean
to fight to a finish Chairman

 ANTHONY nods

WANKLIN Take care The essence of things is to know when to stop

 ANTHONY does not answer

WANKLIN Very gravely This way disaster lies The ancient
Trojans were fools to your father Mrs Underwood He goes out
through the doubledoors

ENID I want to speak to father Frank

 UNDERWOOD follows WANKLIN Out TENCH passing round the table
 is restoring order to the scattered pens and papers

ENID Are nt you coming Dad

 ANTHONY Shakes his head ENID looks meaningly at TENCH

ENID Wont you go and have some lunch Mr Tench

TENCH With papers in his hand Thank you maam thank you He
goes slowly looking back

ENID Shutting the doors I do hope its settled Father

ANTHONY No

ENID Very disappointed Oh Have nt you done anything

 ANTHONY shakes his head

ENID Frank says they all want to come to a compromise really
except that man Roberts

ANTHONY I dont

ENID Its such a horrid position for us If you were the wife of
the manager and lived down here and saw it all You cant realise
Dad

ANTHONY Indeed

ENID We see all the distress You remember my maid Annie who
married Roberts ANTHONY nods Its so wretched her hearts
weak since the strike began she has nt even been getting proper
food I know it for a fact Father

ANTHONY Give her what she wants poor woman

ENID Roberts wont let her take anything from us

ANTHONY Staring before him I cant be answerable for the mens
obstinacy

ENID Theyre all suffering Father Do stop it for my sake

ANTHONY With a keen look at her You dont understand my dear

ENID If I were on the Board Id do something

ANTHONY What would you do

ENID Its because you cant bear to give way Its so

ANTHONY Well

ENID So unnecessary

ANTHONY What do you know about necessity Read your novels play
your music talk your talk but dont try and tell me whats at the
bottom of a struggle like this

ENID I live down here and see it

ANTHONY What d you imagine stands between you and your class and
these men that youre so sorry for

ENID Coldly I dont know what you mean Father

ANTHONY In a few years you and your children would be down in the
condition theyre in but for those who have the eyes to see things
as they are and the backbone to stand up for themselves

ENID You dont know the state the men are in

ANTHONY I know it well enough

ENID You dont Father if you did you would nt

ANTHONY Its you who dont know the simple facts of the position
What sort of mercy do you suppose youd get if no one stood between
you and the continual demands of labour This sort of mercy
He puts his hand up to his throat and squeezes it First would go
your sentiments my dear then your culture and your comforts would
be going all the time

ENID I dont believe in barriers between classes

ANTHONY Youdontbelieveinbarriersbetween the classes

ENID Coldly And I dont know what that has to do with this
question

ANTHONY It will take a generation or two for you to understand

ENID Its only you and Roberts Father and you know it

 ANTHONY thrusts out his lower lip

Itll ruin the Company

ANTHONY Allow me to judge of that

ENID Resentfully I wont stand by and let poor Annie Roberts
suffer like this And think of the children Father I warn you

ANTHONY With a grim smile What do you propose to do

ENID Thats my affair

 ANTHONY only looks at her

ENID In a changed voice stroking his sleeve Father you know
you oughtnt to have this strain on youyou know what Dr Fisher
said

ANTHONY No old man can afford to listen to old women

ENID But you have done enough even if it really is such a matter
of principle with you

ANTHONY You think so

ENID Dont Dad Her face works Youyou might think of us

ANTHONY I am

ENID Itll break you down

ANTHONY Slowly My dear I am not going to funk on that you may
rely

 Reenter TENCH with papers he glances at them then plucking
 up courage

TENCH Beg pardon Madam I think Id rather see these papers were
disposed of before I get my lunch

 ENID after an impatient glance at him looks at her father
 turns suddenly and goes into the drawingroom

TENCH Holding the papers and a pen to ANTHONY very nervously
Would you sign these for me please sir

 ANTHONY takes the pen and signs

TENCH Standing with a sheet of blottingpaper behind EDGARS
chair begins speaking nervously I owe my position to you sir

ANTHONY Well

TENCH Im obliged to see everything thats going on sir II
depend upon the Company entirely If anything were to happen to it
itd be disastrous for me ANTHONY nods And of course my
wifes just had another and so it makes me doubly anxious just now
And the rates are really terrible down our way

ANTHONY With grim amusement Not more terrible than they are up
mine

TENCH No Sir Very nervously I know the Company means a great
deal to you sir

ANTHONY It does I founded it

TENCH Yes Sir If the strike goes on itll be very serious I
think the Directors are beginning to realise that sir

ANTHONY Ironically Indeed

TENCH I know you hold very strong views sir and its always your
habit to look things in the face but I dont think the Directors
like it sir now theythey see it

ANTHONY Grimly Nor you it seems

TENCH With the ghost of a smile No sir of course Ive got my
children and my wifes delicate in my position I have to think of
these things

 ANTHONY nods

It was nt that I was going to say sir if youll excuse me
hesitates

ANTHONY Out with it then

TENCH I knowfrom my own father sir that when you get on in life
you do feel things dreadfully

ANTHONY Almost paternally Come out with it Trench

TENCH I dont like to say it sir

ANTHONY Stonily You Must

TENCH After a pause desperately bolting it out I think the
Directors are going to throw you over sir

ANTHONY Sits in silence Ring the bell

 TENCH nervously rings the bell and stands by the fire

TENCH Excuse me for saying such a thing I was only thinking of
you sir

 FROST enters from the hall he comes to the foot of the table
 and looks at ANTHONY TENCH coveys his nervousness by arranging
 papers

ANTHONY Bring me a whiskey and soda

FROST Anything to eat sir

 ANTHONY shakes his head FROST goes to the sideboard and
 prepares the drink

TENCH In a low voice almost supplicating If you could see your
way sir it would be a great relief to my mind it would indeed
He looks up at ANTHONY who has not moved It does make me so very
anxious I havent slept properly for weeks sir and thats a fact

 ANTHONY looks in his face then slowly shakes his head

Disheartened No Sir He goes on arranging papers

 FROST places the whiskey and salver and puts it down by
 ANTHONYS right hand He stands away looking gravely at
 ANTHONY

FROST Nothing I can get you sir

 ANTHONY shakes his head

Youre aware sir of what the doctor said sir

ANTHONY I am

 A pause FROST suddenly moves closer to him and speaks in a
 low voice

FROST This strike sir puttin all this strain on you Excuse me
sir is itis it worth it sir

 ANTHONY mutters some words that are inaudible

Very good sir

 He turns and goes out into the hall TENCH makes two attempts
 to speak but meeting his Chairmans gaze he drops his eyes
 and turning dismally he too goes out ANTHONY is left alone
 He grips the glass tilts it and drinks deeply then sets it
 down with a deep and rumbling sigh and leans back in his
 chair


 The curtain falls

 opposite the fireplace opens inward from a snowy street On the
 wooden table are a cup and saucer a teapot knife and plate of
 bread and cheese Close to the fireplace in an old armchair

 THEY go out followed by MRS BULGIN

MADGE Moving for the first time There Annie you see that I

 A silence MRS ROBERTS makes a movement of pain

Ah You dont want him beaten Hes your man With everybody like
their own shadows She makes a gesture towards MRS ROBERTS If
ROUS wants me he must give up Roberts If he gave him upthey all
would Theyre only waiting for a lead Fathers against him
theyre all against him in their hearts

MRS ROBERTS You wont beat Roberts

 They look silently at each other

MADGE Wont I The cowardswhen their own mothers and their own
children dont know where to turn

MRS ROBERTS Madge

MADGE Looking searchingly at MRS ROBERTS I wonder he can look
you in the face She squats before the fire with her hands out to
the flame Harness is here again Theyll have to make up their
minds today

MRS ROBERTS In a soft slow voice with a slight Westcountry
burr Roberts will never give up the furnacemen and engineers
T wouldnt be right

MADGE You cant deceive me Its just his pride

 A tapping at the door is heard the women turn as ENID enters
 She wears a round fur cap and a jacket of squirrels fur She
 closes the door behind her

ENID Can I come in Annie

MRS ROBERTS Flinching Miss Enid Give Mrs Underwood a chair
Madge

 MADGE gives ENID the chair she has been sitting on

ENID Thank you

ENID Are you any better

MRS ROBERTS Yes Mm thank you Mm

ENID Looking at the sullen MADGE as though requesting her
departure Why did you send back the jelly I call that really
wicked of you

MRS ROBERTS Thank you Mm Id no need for it

ENID Of course It was Robertss doing wasnt it How can he let
all this suffering go on amongst you

MADGE Suddenly What suffering

ENID Surprised I beg your pardon

MADGE Who said there was suffering

MRS ROBERTS Madge

MADGE Throwing her shawl over her head Please to let us keep
ourselves to ourselves We dont want you coming here and spying on
us

ENID Confronting her but without rising I did nt speak to
you

MADGE In a low fierce voice Keep your kind feelings to
yourself You think you can come amongst us but youre mistaken
Go back and tell the Manager that

ENID Stonily This is not your house

MADGE Turning to the door No it is not my house keep clear of
my house Mrs Underwood

 She goes out ENID taps her fingers on the table

MRS ROBERTS Please to forgive Madge Thomas Mm shes a bit upset
today

 A pause

ENID Looking at her Oh I think theyre so stupid all of them

MRS ROBERTS With a faint smile Yes Mm

ENID Is Roberts out

MRS ROBERTS Yes Mm

ENID It is his doing that they dont come to an agreement Now is
nt it Annie

MRS ROBERTS Softly with her eyes on ENID and moving the fingers
of one hand continually on her breast They do say that your
father Mm

ENID My fathers getting an old man and you know what old men are

MRS ROBERTS I am sorry Mm

ENID More softly I dont expect you to feel sorry Annie I
know its his fault as well as Robertss

MRS ROBERTS Im sorry for any one that gets old Mm it s
dreadful to get old and Mr Anthony was such a fine old man I
always used to think

ENID Impulsively He always liked you dont you remember Look
here Annie what can I do I do so want to know You dont get
what you ought to have Going to the fire she takes the kettle
off and looks for coals And youre so naughty sending back the
soup and things

MRS ROBERTS With a faint smile Yes Mm

ENID Resentfully Why you have nt even got coals

MRS ROBERTS If you please Mm to put the kettle on again
Roberts wont have long for his tea when he comes in Hes got to
meet the men at four

ENID Putting the kettle on That means hell lash them into a
fury again Cant you stop his going Annie

 MRS ROBERTS smiles ironically

Have you tried

 A silence

Does he know how ill you are

MRS ROBERTS Its only my weak eard Mm

ENID You used to be so well when you were with us

MRS ROBERTS Stiffening Roberts is always good to me

ENID But you ought to have everything you want and you have
nothing

MRS ROBERTS Appealingly They tell me I dont look like a dyin
woman

ENID Of course you dont if you could only have proper Will you
see my doctor if I send him to you Im sure hed do you good

MRS ROBERTS With faint questioning Yes Mm

ENID Madge Thomas ought nt to come here she only excites you As
if I did nt know what suffering there is amongst the men I do feel
for them dreadfully but you know they have gone too far

MRS ROBERTS Continually moving her fingers They say theres no
other way to get better wages Mm

ENID Earnestly But Annie thats why the Union wont help
them My husbands very sympathetic with the men but he says they
are not underpaid

MRS ROBERTS No Mm

ENID They never think how the Company could go on if we paid the
wages they want

MRS ROBERTS With an effort But the dividends having been so
big Mm

ENID Takes aback You all seem to think the shareholders are
rich men but theyre notmost of them are really no better off than
working men

 MRS ROBERTS smiles

They have to keep up appearances

MRS ROBERTS Yes Mm

ENID You dont have to pay rates and taxes and a hundred other
things that they do If the men did nt spend such a lot in drink
and betting theyd be quite well off

MRS ROBERTS They say workin so hard they must have some
pleasure

ENID But surely not low pleasure like that

MRS ROBERTS A little resentfully Roberts never touches a drop
and hes never had a bet in his life

ENID Oh but hes not a comI mean hes an engineer
a superior man

MRS ROBERTS Yes Mm Roberts says theyve no chance of other
pleasures

ENID Musing Of course I know its hard

MRS ROBERTS With a spice of malice And they say gentlefolks
just as bad

ENID With a smile I go as far as most people Annie but you
know yourself thats nonsense

MRS ROBERTS With painful effort A lot o the men never go near
the Public but even they dont save but very little and that goes
if theres illness

ENID But theyve got their clubs have nt they

MRS ROBERTS The clubs only give up to eighteen shillins a week
Mm and its not much amongst a family Roberts says workin folk
have always lived from hand to mouth Sixpence today is worth more
than a shillin tomorrow thats what they say

ENID But thats the spirit of gambling

MRS ROBERTS With a sort of excitement Roberts says a working
mans life is all a gamble from the time e s born to the time e
dies

 ENID leans forward interested MRS ROBERTS goes on with a
 growing excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of
 the last words

He says Mm that when a working mans baby is born its a tossup
from breath to breath whether it ever draws another and so on all
is life an when he comes to be old its the workhouse or the
grave He says that without a man is very near and pinches and
stints imself and is children to save there cant be neither
surplus nor security Thats why he wouldnt have no children she
sinks back not though I wanted them

ENID Yes yes I know

MRS ROBERTS No you dont Mm Youve got your children and
youll never need to trouble for them

ENID Gently You oughtnt to be talking so much Annie Then
in spite of herself But Roberts was paid a lot of money was nt
he for discovering that process

MRS ROBERTS On the defensive All Robertss savins have gone
He s always looked forward to this strike He says hes no right to
a farthing when the others are suffering T is nt so with all o
them Some dont seem to care no more than thatso long as they get
their own

ENID I dont see how they can be expected to when they re
suffering like this In a changed voice But Roberts ought to
think of you Its all terrible The kettles boiling Shall I
make the tea She takes the teapot and seeing tea there pours
water into it Wont you have a cup

MRS ROBERTS No thank you Mm She is listening as though for
footsteps Idsooner you did nt see Roberts Mm he gets so
wild

ENID Oh but I must Annie Ill be quite calm I promise

MRS ROBERTS Its life an death to him Mm

ENID Very gently Ill get him to talk to me outside we wont
excite you

MRS ROBERTS Faintly No Mm

 She gives a violent start ROBERTS has come in unseen

ROBERTS Removing his hatwith subtle mockery Beg pardon for
coming in youre engaged with a lady I see

ENID Can I speak to you Mr Roberts

ROBERTS Whom have I the pleasure of addressing Maam

ENID But surely you know me I m Mrs Underwood

ROBERTS With a bow of malice The daughter of our Chairman

ENID Earnestly Ive come on purpose to speak to you will you
come outside a minute

 She looks at MRS ROBERTS

ROBERTS Hanging up his hat I have nothing to say Maam

ENID But I must speak to you please

 She moves towards the door

ROBERTS With sudden venom I have not the time to listen

MRS ROBERTS David

ENID Mr Roberts please

ROBERTS Taking off his overcoat I am sorry to disoblige a lady
Mr Anthonys daughter

ENID Wavering then with sudden decision Mr Roberts I know
youve another meeting of the men

 ROBERTS bows

I came to appeal to you Please please try to come to some
compromise give way a little if its only for your own sakes

ROBERTS Speaking to himself The daughter of Mr Anthony begs me
to give way a little if its only for our own sakes

ENID For everybodys sake for your wifes sake

ROBERTS For my wifes sake for everybodys sakefor the sake of
Mr Anthony

ENID Why are you so bitter against my father He has never done
anything to you

ROBERTS Has he not

ENID He cant help his views any more than you can help yours

ROBERTS I really did nt know that I had a right to views

ENID Hes an old man and you

 Seeing his eyes fixed on her she stops

ROBERTS Without raising his voice If I saw Mr Anthony going to
die and I could save him by lifting my hand I would not lift the
little finger of it

ENID YouyouShe stops again biting her lips

ROBERTS I would not and thats flat

ENID Coldly You dont mean what you say and you know it

ROBERTS I mean every word of it

ENID But why

ROBERTS With a flash Mr Anthony stands for tyranny Thats
why

ENID Nonsense

 MRS ROBERTS makes a movement as if to rise but sinks back in
 her chair

ENID With an impetuous movement Annie

ROBERTS Please not to touch my wife

ENID Recoiling with a sort of horror I believeyou are mad

ROBERTS The house of a madman then is not the fit place for a lady

ENID I m not afraid of you

ROBERTS Bowing I would not expect the daughter of Mr Anthony
to be afraid Mr Anthony is not a coward like the rest of them

ENID Suddenly I suppose you think it brave then to go on with
the struggle

ROBERTS Does Mr Anthony think it brave to fight against women and
children Mr Anthony is a rich man I believe does he think it
brave to fight against those who have nt a penny Does he think it
brave to set children crying with hunger an women shivering with
cold

ENID Putting up her hand as though warding off a blow My
father is acting on his principles and you know it

ROBERTS And so am I

ENID You hate us and you cant bear to be beaten

ROBERTS Neither can Mr Anthony for all that he may say

ENID At any rate you might have pity on your wife

 MRS ROBERTS who has her hand pressed to her heart takes it
 away and tries to calm her breathing

ROBERTS Madam I have no more to say

 He takes up the loaf There is a knock at the door and
 UNDERWOOD comes in He stands looking at them ENID turns to
 him then seems undecided

UNDERWOOD Enid

ROBERTS Ironically Ye were not needing to come for your wife
Mr Underwood We are not rowdies

UNDERWOOD I know that Roberts I hope Mrs Roberts is better

 ROBERTS turns away without answering Come Enid

ENID I make one more appeal to you Mr Roberts for the sake of
your wife

ROBERTS With polite malice If I might advise ye Maammake it
for the sake of your husband and your father

 ENID suppressing a retort goes out UNDERWOOD opens the door
 for her and follows ROBERTS going to the fire holds out his
 hands to the dying glow

ROBERTS How goes it my girl Feeling better are you

 MRS ROBERTS smiles faintly He brings his overcoat and wraps
 it round her

Looking at his watch Ten minutes to four As though inspired
Ive seen their faces theres no fight in them except for that one
old robber

MRS ROBERTS Wont you stop and eat David Youve ad nothing all
day

ROBERTS Putting his hand to his throat Cant swallow till those
old sharks are out o the town He walks up and down I shall have
a bother with the mentheres no heart in them the cowards Blind
as bats they arecant see a day before their noses

MRS ROBERTS Its the women David

ROBERTS Ah So they say They can remember the women when their
own bellies speak The women never stop them from the drink but
from a little suffering to themselves in a sacred cause the women
stop them fast enough

MRS ROBERTS But think o the children David

ROBERTS Ah If they will go breeding themselves for slaves
without a thought o the future o them they breed

MRS ROBERTS Gasping Thats enough David dont begin to talk
of thatI wontI cant

ROBERTS Staring at her Now now my girl

MRS ROBERTS Breathlessly No no DavidI wont

ROBERTS There there Come come Thats right Bitterly Not
one penny will they put by for a day like this Not they Hand to
mouthGadI know them Theyve broke my heart There was no
holdin them at the start but now the pinch as come

MRS ROBERTS How can you expect it David Theyre not made of
iron

ROBERTS Expect it Wouldnt I expect what I would do meself
Wouldnt I starve an rot rather than give in What one man can do
another can

MRS ROBERTS And the women

ROBERTS This is not womens work

MRS ROBERTS With a flash of malice No the women may die for
all you care Thats their work

ROBERTS Averting his eyes Who talks of dying No one will die
till we have beaten these

 He meets her eyes again and again turns his away Excitedly

This is what Ive been waiting for all these months To get the old
robbers down and send them home again without a farthins worth o
change I ve seen their faces I tell you in the valley of the
shadow of defeat

 He goes to the peg and takes down his hat

MRS ROBERTS Following with her eyessoftly Take your overcoat
David it must be bitter cold

ROBERTS Coming up to herhis eyes are furtive No no There
there stay quiet and warm I wont be long my girl

MRS ROBERTS With soft bitterness Youd better take it

 She lifts the coat But ROBERTS puts it back and wraps it
 round her He tries to meet her eyes but cannot MRS
 ROBERTS stays huddled in the coat her eyes that follow him
 about are half malicious half yearning He looks at his watch
 again and turns to go In the doorway he meets JAN THOMAS a
 boy of ten in clothes too big for him carrying a penny
 whistle

ROBERTS Hallo boy

 He goes JAN stops within a yard of MRS ROBERTS and stares
 at her without a word

MRS ROBERTS Well Jan

JAN Father s coming sister Madge is coming

 He sits at the table and fidgets with his whistle he blows
 three vague notes then imitates a cuckoo

 He goes out MADGE in the centre of the open doorway
 slowly moves in as though before the approach of some one

ROUS Appearing in the doorway Madge

 MADGE stands with her back to MRS ROBERTS staring at him with
 her head up and her hands behind her

ROUS Who has a fierce distracted look Madge Im going to the
meeting

 MADGE without moving smiles contemptuously

D ye hear me

 They speak in quick low voices

MADGE I hear Go and kill your own mother if you must

ROUS seizes her by both her arms She stands rigid with her head
bent back He releases her and he too stands motionless

ROUS I swore to stand by Roberts I swore that Ye want me to go
back on what Ive sworn

MADGE With slow soft mockery You are a pretty lover

ROUS Madge

MADGE Smiling Ive heard that lovers do what their girls ask
them

 JAN sounds the cuckoos notes

 He turns and rushes off

 MADGE Stands with a faint smile on her face looking after
 him She turns to MRS ROBERTS

She sinks back

 JAN begins again to play his whistle MADGE gets up half
 tenderly she ruffles his hair then sitting leans her elbows
 on the table and her chin on her hands Behind her on MRS
 ROBERTSS face the smile has changed to horrified surprise She
 makes a sudden movement sitting forward pressing her hands
 against her breast Then slowly she sinks back slowly her
 face loses the look of pain the smile returns She fixes her
 eyes again on JAN and moves her lips and finger to the tune


 The curtain falls




SCENE II

 It is past four In a grey failing light an open muddy space
 is crowded with workmen Beyond divided from it by a
 barbedwire fence is the raised towingpath of a canal on which
 is moored a barge In the distance are marshes and snowcovered
 hills The Works high wall runs from the canal across the open
 space and ivy the angle of this wall is a rude platform of
 barrels and boards On it HARNESS is standing ROBERTS a
 little apart from the crowd leans his back against the wall On
 the raised towingpath two bargemen lounge and smoke
 indifferently

HARNESS Holding out his hand Well Ive spoken to you straight
If I speak till tomorrow I cant say more

JAGO A dark sallow Spanishlooking man with a short thin
beard Mister want to ask you Can they get blacklegs

BULGIN Menacing Let em try

 There are savage murmurs from the crowd

BROWN A roundfaced man Where could they get em then

EVANS A small restless harassed man with a fighting face
Theres always blacklegs its the nature of em Theres always men
thatll save their own skins

 Another savage murmur There is a movement and old THOMAS
 joining the crowd takes his stand in front

HARNESS Holding up his hand They cant get them But that
wont help you Now men be reasonable Your demands would have
brought on us the burden of a dozen strikes at a time when we were
not prepared for them The Unions live by justice not to one but
all Any fair man will tell youyou were illadvised I dont say
you go too far for that which youre entitled to but youre going
too far for the moment youve dug a pit for yourselves Are you to
stay there or are you to climb out Come

LEWIS A cleancut Welshman with a dark moustache Youve hit it
Mister Which is it to be

 Another movement in the crowd and ROUS coming quickly takes
 his stand next THOMAS

HARNESS Cut your demands to the right pattern and we ll see you
through refuse and dont expect me to waste my time coming down
here again I m not the sort that speaks at random as you ought to
know by this time If youre the sound men I take you forno matter
who advises you against ithe fixes his eyes on ROBERTS you ll
make up your minds to come in and trust to us to get your terms
Which is it to be Hands together and victoryorthe starvation
youve got now

 A prolonged murmur from the crowd

JAGO Sullenly Talk about what you know

HARNESS Lifting his voice above the murmur Know With cold
passion All that youve been through my friend I ve been
throughI was through it when I was no bigger than pointing to a
youth that shaver there the Unions then were nt what they are

strong I ve been through it all I tell you the brands on my
soul yet I know what you ve sufferedtheres nothing you can tell
me that I dont know but the whole is greater than the part and you

 Quartering them with his eyes he waits The murmuring swells
 the men form little groups GREEN BULGIN and LEWIS talk
 together

LEWIS Speaks very sensible the Union chap

GREEN Quietly Ah if I d a been listened to youd ave eard
sense these two months past

 The bargemen are seen laughing 

LEWIS Pointing Look at those two blanks over the fence there

BULGIN With gloomy violence Theyd best stop their cackle or I
ll break their jaws

JAGO Suddenly You say the furnace mens paid enough

HARNESS I did not say they were paid enough I said they were paid
as much as the furnace men in similar works elsewhere

EVANS Thats a lie Hubbub What about Harpers

HARNESS With cold irony You may look at home for lies my man
Harpers shifts are longer the pay works out the same

HENRY ROUS A dark edition of his brother George Will ye support
us in double pay overtime Saturdays

HARNESS Yes we will

JAGO What have ye done with our subscriptions

EVANS Ah will its always will Yed have our mates desert us

 EVANS looks round angrily

HARNESS Lifting his voice Those who know their right hands from
their lefts know that the Unions are neither thieves nor traitors
I ve said my say Figure it out my lads when you want me you know
where I shall be

 He jumps down the crowd gives way he passes through them and
 goes away A BARGEMAN looks after him jerking his pipe with a
 derisive gesture The men close up in groups and many looks
 are cast at ROBERTS who stands alone against the wall

EVANS He wants ye to turn blacklegs thats what he wants He
wants ye to go back on us Sooner than turn blacklegI d starve I

DAVIES A dark slowfly gloomy man Go up the platform if you

 There are cries of Thomas He is pushed towards the
 platform he ascends it with difficulty and bares his head
 waiting for silence A hush

REDHAIRED YOUTH suddenly Coot old Thomas

 A hoarse laugh the bargemen exchange remarks a hush again
 and THOMAS begins speaking

THOMAS We are all in the tepth together and it iss Nature that has
put us there

HENRY ROUS Its London put us there

EVANS Its the Union

THOMAS It iss not Lonton nor it iss not the Unionit iss Nature
It iss no disgrace whateffer to a potty to give in to Nature For
this Nature iss a fery pig thing it is pigger than what a man is
There iss more years to my hett than to the hett of any one here
It is fery pat look you this Going against Nature It is pat to
make other potties suffer when there is nothing to pe cot py it

 A laugh THOMAS angrily goes on

What are ye laughing at It is pat I say We are fighting for a
principle there is no potty that shall say I am not a peliever in
principle Putt when Nature says No further then it is no coot
snapping your fingers in her face

 A laugh from ROBERTS and murmurs of approval

This Nature must pe humort It is a mans pisiness to pe pure
honest just and merciful Thats what Chapel tells you To
ROBERTS angrily And look you David Roberts Chapel tells you ye
can do that without Going against Nature

JAGO What about the Union

peoples moneys We haf fought fair and if we haf peen beaten it
iss no fault of ours Gif us the power to make terms with London for
ourself if we tont succeed I say it iss petter to take our peating

EVANS Muttering Who wants to

REDHAIRED YOUTH Ah long ones

 The Shaver laughs there are murmurs from the crowd

THOMAS Fixing his eyes on The Shaver Ah ye re Going the
roat to tamnation An so I say to all of you If ye co against
Chapel I will not pe with you nor will any other Gotfearing man

 He steps down from the platform JAGO makes his way towards
 it There are cries of Dont let im go up

JAGO Dont let him go up Thats free speech that is He goes
up I aint got much to say to you Look at the matter plain ye
ve come the road this far and now you want to chuck the journey
Weve all been in one boat and now you want to pull in two We

so early one bright morning Thats all I ve got to say Old man
Thomas ant got his Bible lesson right If you give up to London
or to Harness now its givin us the chuckto save your skinsyou
wont get over that my boys its a dirty thing to do

 He gets down during his little speech which is ironically
 spoken there is a restless discomfort in the crowd ROUS
 stepping forward jumps on the platform He has an air of
 fierce distraction Sullen murmurs of disapproval from the
 crowd

ROUS Speaking with great excitement Im no blanky orator
mates but wot I say is drove from me What I say is yuman nature
Can a man set an see is mother starve Can e now

ROBERTS Starting forward Rous

ROUS Staring at him fiercely Sim Arness said fair Ive
changed my mind

ROBERTS Ah Turned your coat you mean

 The crowd manifests a great surprise

LEWIS Apostrophising Rous Hallo Whats turned him round

ROUS Speaking with intense excitement E said fair Stand by
us e said and well stand by you Thats where weve been
makin our mistake this long time past and whos to blame fort He
points at ROBERTS That man there No e said fight the
robbers e said squeeze the breath out o them But its not the
breath out o them thats being squeezed its the breath out of us
and ours and thats the book of truth Im no orator mates its
the flesh and blood in me thats speakin its the heart o me
With a menacing yet halfashamed movement towards ROBERTS Hell
speak to you again mark my words but dont ye listen The crowd
groans Its hell fire thats on that mans tongue ROBERTS is
seen laughing Sim Arness is right What are we without the
Unionhandful o parched leavesa puff o smoke Im no orator
but I say Chuck it up Chuck it up Sooner than go on starving the
women and the children

 The murmurs of acquiescence almost drown the murmurs of
 dissent

EVANS Whats turned you to blacklegging

ROUS With a furious look Sim Arness knows what hes talking
about Give us power to come to terms with London Im no orator
but I sayhave done wi this black misery

 He gives his muter a twist jerks his head back and jumps off
 the platform The crowd applauds and surges forward Amid
 cries of Thats enough Up Union Up Harness ROBERTS
 quietly ascends the platform There is a moment of silence

BLACKSMITH We dont want to hear you Shut it

HENRY Rous Get down

 Amid such cries they surge towards the platform

EVANS Fiercely Let im speak Roberts Roberts

BULGIN Muttering Hed better look out that I dont crack his
skull

 ROBERTS faces the crowd probing them with his eyes till they
 gradually become silent He begins speaking One of the
 bargemen rises and stands

ROBERTS You dont want to hear me then Youll listen to Rous and
to that old man but not to me Youll listen to Sim Harness of the
Union thats treated you so fair maybe youll listen to those men
from London Ah You groan What for You love their feet on your
necks dont you Then as BULGIN elbows his way towards the
platform with calm bathos Youd like to break my jaw John
Bulgin Let me speak then do your smashing if it gives you
pleasure BULGIN Stands motionless and sullen Am I a liar a
coward a traitor If only I were yed listen to me Im sure
The murmurings cease and there is now dead silence Is there a
man of you here that has less to gain by striking Is there a man of
you that had more to lose Is there a man of you that has given up
eight hundred pounds since this trouble here began Come now is
there How much has Thomas given upten pounds or five or what
You listened to him and what had he to say None can pretend he
said that Im not a believer in principlewith biting ironybut
when Nature says No further t es going agenst Nature I tell
you if a man cannot say to Nature Budge me from this if ye can
with a sort of exaltation his principles are but his belly Oh
but Thomas says a man can be pure and honest just and merciful
and take off his hat to Nature I tell you Natures neither pure
nor honest just nor merciful You chaps that live over the hill
an go home dead beat in the dark on a snowy nightdont ye fight
your way every inch of it Do ye go lyin down an trustin to the
tender mercies of this merciful Nature Try it and youll soon know
with what yeve got to deal T es only by thathe strikes a blow
with his clenched fistin Natures face that a man can be a man
Give in says Thomas go down on your knees throw up your foolish
fight an perhaps he said perhaps your enemy will chuck you down
a crust

JAGO Never

EVANS Curse them

THOMAS I nefer said that

ROBERTS Bitingly If ye did not say it man ye meant it
An what did ye say about Chapel Chapels against it ye said
She s against it Well if Chapel and Nature go hand in hand
its the first Ive ever heard of it That young man there
pointing to ROUSsaid I ad ell fire on my tongue If I had I
would use it all to scorch and wither this talking of surrender
Surrendering s the work of cowards and traitors

HENRY ROUS As GEORGE ROUS moves forward Go for him George
dont stand his lip

ROBERTS Flinging out his finger Stop there George Rous its
no time this to settle personal matters ROUS stops But there
was one other spoke to youMr Simon Harness We have not much to
thank Mr Harness and the Union for They said to us Desert your
mates or well desert you An they did desert us

EVANS They did

ROBERTS Mr Simon Harness is a clever man but he has come too
late With intense conviction For all that Mr Simon Harness
says for all that Thomas Rous for all that any man present here
can sayWeve won the fight

 The crowd sags nearer looking eagerly up

With withering scorn Youve felt the pinch ot in your bellies
Youve forgotten what that fight as been many times I have told
you I will tell you now this once again The fight o the countrys
body and blood against a bloodsucker The fight of those that spend
themselves with every blow they strike and every breath they draw
against a thing that fattens on them and grows and grows by the law
of merciful Nature That thing is Capital A thing that buys the
sweat o mens brows and the tortures o their brains at its own
price Dont I know that Wasnt the work o my brains bought for
seven hundred pounds and has nt one hundred thousand pounds been
gained them by that seven hundred without the stirring of a finger
It is a thing that will take as much and give you as little as it
can Thats Capital A thing that will sayIm very sorry for
you poor fellowsyou have a cruel time of it I know but will not
give one sixpence of its dividends to help you have a better time
Thats Capital Tell me for all their talk is there one of them
that will consent to another penny on the Income Tax to help the
poor Thats Capital A whitefaced stonyhearted monster Ye
have got it on its knees are ye to give up at the last minute to
save your miserable bodies pain When I went this morning to those
old men from London I looked into their very earts One of them
was sitting thereMr Scantlebury a mass of flesh nourished on us
sittin there for all the world like the shareholders in this
Company that sit not moving tongue nor finger takin dividends a
great dumb ox that can only be roused when its food is threatened
I looked into his eyes and I saw he was afraidafraid for himself
and his dividends afraid for his fees afraid of the very
shareholders he stands for and all but one of thems afraidlike
children that get into a wood at night and start at every rustle of
the leaves I ask you menhe pauses holding out his hand till
there is utter silencegive me a free hand to tell them Go you
back to London The men have nothing for you A murmuring Give
me that an I swear to you within a week you shall have from London
all you want

EVANS JAGO and OTHERS A free hand Give him a free hand Bravo
bravo

ROBERTS T is not for this little moment of time were fighting
the murmuring dies not for ourselves our own little bodies and
their wants t is for all those that come after throughout all time
With intense sadness Oh menfor the love o them dont roll
up another stone upon their heads dont help to blacken the sky an
let the bitter sea in over them Theyre welcome to the worst that
can happen to me to the worst that can happen to us all are nt
theyare nt they If we can shake passionately that whitefaced
monster with the bloody lips that has sucked the life out of
ourselves our wives and children since the world began Dropping
the note of passion but with the utmost weight and intensity If we
have not the hearts of men to stand against it breast to breast and
eye to eye and force it backward till it cry for mercy it will go
on sucking life and we shall stay forever what we are in almost a
whisper less than the very dogs

 An utter stillness and ROBERTS stands rocking his body
 slightly with his eyes burning the faces of the crowd

EVANS and JAGO Suddenly Roberts The shout is taken up

 There is a slight movement in the crowd and MADGE passing
 below the towingpath stops by the platform looking up at
 ROBERTS A sudden doubting silence

ROBERTS Nature says that old man give in to Nature I tell
you strike your blow in Natures facean let it do its worst

 He catches sight of MADGE his brows contract he looks away

MADGE In a low voiceclose to the platform Your wifes dying

 ROBERTS glares at her as if torn from some pinnacle of
 exaltation

ROBERTS Trying to stammer on I say to youanswer themanswer
them

 He is drowned by the murmur in the crowd

THOMAS Stepping forward Tont you hear her then

ROBERTS What is it A dead silence

THOMAS Your wife man

 ROBERTS hesitates then with a gesture he leaps down and goes
 away below the towingpath the men making way for him The
 standing bargeman opens and prepares to light a lantern
 Daylight is fast failing

MADGE He need nt have hurried Annie Roberts is dead Then in
the silence passionately You pack of blinded hounds How many
more women are you going to let to die

 The crowd shrinks back from her and breaks up in groups with
 a confused uneasy movement MADGE goes quickly away below the
 towingpath There is a hush as they look after her

LEWIS Theres a spitfire for ye

BULGIN Growling Ill smash er jaw

GREEN If Id abeen listened to that poor woman

THOMAS Its a judgment on him for going against Chapel I tolt him
how t would be

EVANS All the more reason for sticking by im A cheer Are you

 The crowd is murmuring and cheering all at once

ROUS Stepping in front of platform Lost his wife Aye Cant

Yell have the same in all your houses before long

LEWIS Aye aye

HENRY ROUS Right George right

 The cry is taken up

EVANS Fiercely Kick a man thats down Down

BULGIN Savagelysquaring up to him Who are ye callin

 enjoying the sight Old THOMAS steps forward and holds out his
 hands

THOMAS Shame on your strife

 The BLACKSMITH BROWN LEWIS and the REDHAIRED YOUTH pull
 EVANS and BULGIN apart The stage is almost dark


 The curtain falls




ACT III

 It is five oclock In the UNDERWOODS drawingroom which is
 artistically furnished ENID is sitting on the sofa working at a
 babys frock EDGAR by a little spindlelegged table in the
 centre of the room is fingering a chinabox His eyes are
 fixed on the doubledoors that lead into the diningroom

EDGAR Putting down the chinabox and glancing at his watch
Just on five theyre all in there waiting except Frank Wheres
he

ENID Hes had to go down to Gasgoynes about a contract Will you
want him

EDGAR He cant help us This is a directors job Motioning
towards a single door half hidden by a curtain Father in his room

ENID Yes

EDGAR I wish hed stay there Enid

 ENID looks up at him This is a beastly business old girl

 He takes up the little box again and turns it over and over

ENID I went to the Robertss this afternoon Ted

EDGAR That was nt very wise

ENID Hes simply killing his wife

EDGAR We are you mean

ENID Suddenly Roberts ought to give way

EDGAR Theres a lot to be said on the mens side

ENID I dont feel half so sympathetic with them as I did before I
went They just set up class feeling against you Poor Annie was
looking dread fully badfire going out and nothing fit for her to
eat

 EDGAR walks to and fro

But she would stand up for Roberts When you see all this
wretchedness going on and feel you can do nothing you have to shut
your eyes to the whole thing

EDGAR If you can

ENID When I went I was all on their side but as soon as I got
there I began to feel quite different at once People talk about
sympathy with the working classes they dont know what it means to
try and put it into practice It seems hopeless

EDGAR Ah well

ENID Its dreadful going on with the men in this state I do hope
the Dad will make concessions

EDGAR He wont Gloomily Its a sort of religion with him
Curse it I know whats coming Hell be voted down

ENID They would nt dare

EDGAR They willtheyre in a funk

ENID Indignantly Hed never stand it

EDGAR With a shrug My dear girl if youre beaten in a vote
youve got to stand it

ENID Oh She gets up in alarm But would he resign

EDGAR Of course It goes to the roots of his beliefs

ENID But hes so wrapped up in this company Ted Thered be
nothing left for him Itd be dreadful

 EDGAR shrugs his shoulders

Oh Ted hes so old now You must nt let them

EDGAR Hiding his feelings in an outburst My sympathies in this
strike are all on the side of the men

ENID Hes been Chairman for more than thirty years He made the
whole thing And think of the bad times theyve had its always
been he who pulled them through Oh Ted you must

EDGAR What is it you want You said just now you hoped hed make
concessions Now you want me to back him in not making them This
is nt a game Enid

ENID Hotly It is nt a game to me that the Dads in danger of
losing all he cares about in life If he wont give way and hes
beaten itll simply break him down

EDGAR Did nt you say it was dreadful going on with the men in this
state

ENID But cant you see Ted Fatherll never get over it You must
stop them somehow The others are afraid of him If you back him
up

EDGAR Putting his hand to his head Against my convictions
against yours The moment it begins to pinch one personally

ENID It is nt personal its the Dad

EDGAR Your family or yourself and over goes the show

ENID Resentfully If you dont take it seriously I do

EDGAR I am as fond of him as you are thats nothing to do with it

ENID We cant tell about the men its all guesswork But we know
the Dad might have a stroke any day D you mean to say that he
isnt more to you than

EDGAR Of course he is

ENID I dont understand you then

EDGAR Hm

ENID If it were for oneself it would be different but for our own
Father You dont seem to realise

EDGAR I realise perfectly

ENID Its your first duty to save him

EDGAR I wonder

ENID Imploring Oh Ted Its the only interest hes got left
itll be like a deathblow to him

EDGAR Restraining his emotion I know

ENID Promise

EDGAR Ill do what I can

 He turns to the doubledoors

 The curtained door is opened and ANTHONY appears EDGAR opens
 the doubledoors and passes through

 SCANTLEBURYS voice is faintly heard Past five we shall
 never get throughhave to eat another dinner at that hotel
 The doors are shut ANTHONY walks forward

ANTHONY Youve been seeing Roberts I hear

ENID Yes

ANTHONY Do you know what trying to bridge such a gulf as this is
like

 ENID puts her work on the little table and faces him

Filling a sieve with sand

ENID Dont

ANTHONY You think with your gloved hands you can cure the trouble
of the century

 He passes on 

ENID Father

 ANTHONY Stops at the double doors

Im only thinking of you

ANTHONY More softly I can take care of myself my dear

ENID Have you thought whatll happen if youre beaten
she pointsin there

ANTHONY I dont mean to be

ENID Oh Father dont give them a chance Youre not well need

ANTHONY With a grim smile Cut and run

ENID But theyll outvote you

ANTHONY Putting his hand on the doors We shall see

ENID I beg you Dad Wont you

 ANTHONY looks at her softly

 ANTHONY shakes his head He opens the doors A buzz of voices
 comes in

SCANTLEBURY Can one get dinner on that 630 train up

TENCH No Sir I believe not sir

WILDER Well I shall speak out Ive had enough of this

EDGAR Sharply What

 It ceases instantly ANTHONY passes through closing the doors
 behind him ENID springs to them with a gesture of dismay She
 puts her hand on the knob and begins turning it then goes to
 the fireplace and taps her foot on the fender Suddenly she
 rings the bell FROST comes in by the door that leads into the
 hall

FROST Yes Mm

ENID When the men come Frost please show them in here the
hall s cold

FROST I could put them in the pantry Mm

ENID No I dont want toto offend them theyre so touchy

FROST Yes Mm Pause Excuse me Mr Anthonys ad nothing to

ENID I know Frost

FROST Nothin but two whiskies and sodas Mm

ENID Oh you oughtnt to have let him have those

FROST Gravely Mr Anthony is a little difficult Mm Its not
as if he were a younger man an knew what was good for im he will
have his own way

ENID I suppose we all want that

FROST Yes Mm Quietly Excuse me speakin about the strike
Im sure if the other gentlemen were to give up to Mr Anthony and
quietly let the men ave what they want afterwards thatd be the
best way I find that very useful with him at times Mm

 ENID shakes hey head

If hes crossed it makes him violent with an air of discovery
and Ive noticed in my own case when Im violent Im always sorry
for it afterwards

ENID With a smile Are you ever violent Frost

FROST Yes Mm oh sometimes very violent

ENID Ive never seen you

FROST Impersonally No Mm that is so

 ENID fidgets towards the back of the door

With feeling Bein with Mr Anthony as you know Mm ever since
I was fifteen it worries me to see him crossed like this at his age
Ive taken the liberty to speak to Mr Wanklin dropping his voice
seems to be the most sensible of the gentlemenbut e said to me
Thats all very well Frost but this strikes a very serious
thing e said Serious for all parties no doubt I said but
yumour im sir I said yumour im Its like this if a man
comes to a stone wall e does nt drive is ead against it e gets
over it Yes e said youd better tell your master that
FROST looks at his nails Thats where it is Mm I said to Mr
Anthony this morning Is it worth it sir Damn it he said to
me Frost Mind your own business or take a months notice Beg
pardon Mm for using such a word

ENID Moving to the doubledoors and listening Do you know that
man Roberts Frost

FROST Yes Mm thats to say not to speak to But to look at im

ENID Stopping Yes

FROST Hes not one of these ere ordinary armless Socialists
Es violent got a fire inside im What I call personal A man
may ave what opinions e likes so long as e s not personal when
e s that e s not safe

ENID I think thats what my father feels about Roberts

FROST No doubt Mm Mr Anthony has a feeling against him

 ENID glances at him sharply but finding him in perfect
 earnest stands biting her lips and looking at the
 doubledoors

It s a regular right down struggle between the two Ive no
patience with this Roberts from what I ear hes just an ordinary
workin man like the rest of em If he did invent a thing hes no
worse off than undreds of others My brother invented a new kind o
dumbwaiternobody gave him anything for it an there it is bein
used all over the place

 ENID moves closer to the doubledoors

Theres a kind o man that never forgives the world because e
wasnt born a gentleman What I say isno man thats a gentleman
looks down on another because e appens to be a class or two above
im no more than if e appens to be a class or two below

ENID With slight impatience Yes I know Frost of course
Will you please go in and ask if theyll have some tea say I sent
you

FROST Yes Mm

 He opens the doors gently and goes in There is a momentary
 sound of earnest gather angry talk

WILDER I dont agree with you

WANKLIN Weve had this over a dozen times

EDGAR Impatiently Well whats the proposition

SCANTLEBURY Yes what does your father say Tea Not for me not

WANKLIN What I understand the Chairman to say is this

 FROST reenters closing the door behind him

ENID Moving from the door Wont they have any tea Frost

 She goes to the little table and remains motionless looking
 at the babys frock

 A parlourmaid enters from the hall

ENID With rage and emotion Thats wicked My father is
suffering himself through this wretched strike

MADGE With sombre triumph Then tell him Mrs Roberts is dead
That ll make him better

ENID Go away

MADGE When a person hurts us we get it back on them

 She makes a sudden and swift movement towards ENID fixing her
 eyes on the childs frock lying across the little table ENID
 snatches the frock up as though it were the child itself They
 stand a yard apart crossing glances

MADGE Pointing to the frock with a little smile Ah You felt
that Lucky its her mothernot her childrenyouve to look after

ENID Go away

MADGE Ive given you the message

 She turns and goes out into the hall ENID motionless till
 she has gone sinks down at the table bending her head over the
 frock which she is still clutching to her The doubledoors
 are opened and ANTHONY comes slowly in he passes his daughter
 and lowers himself into an armchair He is very flushed

ENID Hiding her emotionanxiously What is it Dad

 ANTHONY makes a gesture but does not speak

 EDGAR Coming in They speak together in low tones

 They look at ANTHONY

 The doors open wider WANKLIN appears With SCANTLEBURY

SCANTLEBURY Sotto voce I dont like the look of this

WANKLIN Going forward Come Chairman Wilder sends you his
apologies A man cant do more

 WILDER followed by TENCH comes in and goes to ANTHONY

WILDER Glumly I withdraw my words sir Im sorry

 ANTHONY nods to him

ENID You have nt come to a decision Mr Wanklin

 WANKLIN shakes his head

WANKLIN Were all here Chairman what do you say Shall we get on
with the business or shall we go back to the other room

SCANTLEBURY Yes yes lets get on We must settle something

 He turns from a small chair and settles himself suddenly in
 the largest chair with a sigh of comfort

 WILDER and WANKLIN also sit and TENCH drawing up a
 straightbacked chair close to his Chairman sits on the edge
 of it with the minutebook and a stylographic pen

ENID Whispering I want to speak to you a minute Ted

 They go out through the doubledoors

WANKLIN Really Chairman its no use soothing ourselves with a
sense of false security If this strikes not brought to an end
before the General Meeting the shareholders will certainly haul us
over the coals

SCANTLEBURY Stirring Whatwhats that

WANKLIN I know it for a fact

ANTHONY Let them

WILDER And get turned out

WANKLIN To ANTHONY I dont mind martyrdom for a policy in which
I believe but I object to being burnt for some one elses
principles

SCANTLEBURY Very reasonableyou must see that Chairman

ANTHONY We owe it to other employers to stand firm

WANKLIN Theres a limit to that

ANTHONY You were all full of fight at the start

SCANTLEBURY With a sort of groan We thought the men would give
in but theyhave nt

ANTHONY They will

WILDER Rising and pacing up and down I cant have my reputation
as a man of business destroyed for the satisfaction of starving the
men out Almost in tears I cant have it How can we meet the
shareholders with things in the state they are

SCANTLEBURY Hear hearhear hear

WILDER Lashing himself If any one expects me to say to them
Ive lost you fifty thousand pounds and sooner than put my pride in
my pocket Ill lose you another Glancing at ANTHONY Itsits
unnatural I dont want to go against you sir

WANKLIN Persuasively Come Chairman we re not free agents
Were part of a machine Our only business is to see the Company
earns as much profit as it safely can If you blame me for want of
principle I say that were Trustees Reason tells us we shall never
get back in the saving of wages what we shall lose if we continue
this strugglereally Chairman we must bring it to an end on the
best terms we can make

ANTHONY No

 There is a pause of general dismay

WILDER Its a deadlock then Letting his hands drop with a sort
of despair Now I shall never get off to Spain

WANKLIN Retaining a trace of irony You hear the consequences of
your victory Chairman

WILDER With a burst of feeling My wifes ill

SCANTLEBURY Dear dear You dont say so

WILDER If I dont get her out of this cold I wont answer for the
consequences

 Through the doubledoors EDGAR comes in looking very grave

EDGAR To his Father Have you heard this sir Mrs Roberts is
dead

 Every one stages at him as if trying to gauge the importance
 of this news

Enid saw her this afternoon she had no coals or food or anything
Its enough

 There is a silence every one avoiding the others eyes except
 ANTHONY who stares hard at his son

SCANTLEBURY You dont suggest that we could have helped the poor
thing

WILDER Flustered The woman was in bad health Nobody can say
theres any responsibility on us At leastnot on me

EDGAR Hotly I say that we are responsible

ANTHONY War is war

EDGAR Not on women

WANKLIN It not infrequently happens that women are the greatest
sufferers

EDGAR If we knew that all the more responsibility rests on us

ANTHONY This is no matter for amateurs

EDGAR Call me what you like sir Its sickened me We had no
right to carry things to such a length

WILDER I dont like this business a bitthat Radical rag will
twist it to their own ends see if they dont Theyll get up some
cock and bull story about the poor womans dying from starvation I
wash my hands of it

EDGAR You cant None of us can

SCANTLEBURY Striking his fist on the arm of his chair But I
protest against this

EDGAR Protest as you like Mr Scantlebury it wont alter facts

ANTHONY Thats enough

EDGAR Facing him angrily No sir I tell you exactly what I
think If we pretend the men are not suffering its humbug and if
theyre suffering we know enough of human nature to know the women
are suffering more and as to the childrenwellits damnable

 SCANTLEBURY rises from his chair

I dont say that we meant to be cruel I dont say anything of the
sort but I do say its criminal to shut our eyes to the facts We
employ these men and we cant get out of it I dont care so much
about the men but Id sooner resign my position on the Board than go
on starving women in this way

 All except ANTHONY are now upon their feet ANTHONY sits
 grasping the arms of his chair and staring at his son

SCANTLEBURY I dontI dont like the way youre putting it young
sir

WANKLIN Youre rather overshooting the mark

WILDER I should think so indeed

EDGAR Losing control Its no use blinking things If you want
to have the death of women on your handsI dont

SCANTLEBURY Now now young man

WILDER On our hands Not on mine I wont have it

EDGAR We are five members of this Board if we were four against
it why did we let it drift till it came to this You know perfectly
well whybecause we hoped we should starve the men out Well all
weve done is to starve one woman out

SCANTLEBURY Almost hysterically I protest I protest Im a
humane manwere all humane men

EDGAR Scornfully Theres nothing wrong with our humanity Its
our imaginations Mr Scantlebury

WILDER Nonsense My imaginations as good as yours

EDGAR If so it is nt good enough

WILDER I foresaw this

EDGAR Then why didnt you put your foot down

WILDER Much good that would have done

 He looks at ANTHONY

EDGAR If you and I and each one of us here who say that our
imaginations are so good

SCANTLEBURY Flurried I never said so

EDGAR Paying no attentionhad put our feet down the thing
would have been ended long ago and this poor womans life wouldnt
have been crushed out of her like this For all we can tell there
may be a dozen other starving women

SCANTLEBURY For Gods sake sir dont use that word at aat a
Board meeting itsits monstrous

EDGAR I will use it Mr Scantlebury

SCANTLEBURY Then I shall not listen to you I shall not listen
Its painful to me

 He covers his ears

WANKLIN None of us are opposed to a settlement except your Father

EDGAR Im certain that if the shareholders knew

WANKLIN I dont think youll find their imaginations are any better
than ours Because a woman happens to have a weak heart

EDGAR A struggle like this finds out the weak spots in everybody
Any child knows that If it hadnt been for this cutthroat policy
she need nt have died like this and there would nt be all this
misery that any one who is nt a fool can see is going on

 Throughout the foregoing ANTHONY has eyed his son he now moves
 as though to rise but stops as EDGAR speaks again

I dont defend the men or myself or anybody

WANKLIN You may have to A coroners jury of disinterested
sympathisers may say some very nasty things We mustnt lose sight
of our position

SCANTLEBURY Without uncovering his ears Coroners jury No
no its not a case for that

EDGAR I ve had enough of cowardice

WANKLIN Cowardice is an unpleasant word Mr Edgar Anthony It
will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the mens
demands when a thing like this happens we must be careful

WILDER Of course we must Weve no knowledge of this matter
except a rumour The proper course is to put the whole thing into
the hands of Harness to settle for us thats natural thats what we
should have come to any way

SCANTLEBURY With dignity Exactly Turning to EDGAR And as
to you young sir I cant sufficiently express mymy distaste for
the way youve treated the whole matter You ought to withdraw
Talking of starvation talking of cowardice Considering what our
views are Except your own isis one of goodwillits most
irregular its most improper and all I can say is itsits given
me pain

 He places his hand over his heart

EDGAR Stubbornly I withdraw nothing

 He is about to say mote when SCANTLEBURY once more coveys up
 his ears TENCH suddenly makes a demonstration with the
 minutebook A sense of having been engaged in the unusual comes
 over all of them and one by one they resume their seats EDGAR
 alone remains on his feet

WILDER With an air of trying to wipe something out I pay no
attention to what young Mr Anthony has said Coroners jury The
ideas preposterous II move this amendment to the Chairmans
Motion That the dispute be placed at once in the hands of Mr Simon
Harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning
Any one second that

 TENCH writes in his book

WANKLIN I do

WILDER Very well then I ask the Chairman to put it to the Board

ANTHONY With a great sighslowly We have been made the subject
of an attack Looking round at WILDER and SCANTLEBURY with ironical
contempt I take it on my shoulders I am seventysix years old I
have been Chairman of this Company since its inception twoandthirty
years ago I have seen it pass through good and evil report My
connection with it began in the year that this young man was born

 EDGAR bows his head ANTHONY gripping his chair goes on

I have had do to with men for fifty years Ive always stood up to
them I have never been beaten yet I have fought the men of this
Company four times and four times I have beaten them It has been
said that I am not the man I was He looks at Wilder However
that may be I am man enough to stand to my guns

 His voice grows stronger The doubledoors are opened ENID
 slips in followed by UNDERWOOD who restrains her

The men have been treated justly they have had fair wages we have
always been ready to listen to complaints It has been said that
times have changed if they have I have not changed with them
Neither will I It has been said that masters and men are equal
Cant There can only be one master in a house Where two men meet
the better man will rule It has been said that Capital and Labour
have the same interests Cant Their interests are as wide asunder
as the poles It has been said that the Board is only part of a
machine Cant We are the machine its brains and sinews it is for
us to lead and to determine what is to be done and to do it without
fear or favour Fear of the men Fear of the shareholders Fear of
our own shadows Before I am like that I hope to die

 He pauses and meeting his sons eyes goes on

There is only one way of treating menwith the iron hand This
half and half business the half and half manners of this generation
has brought all this upon us Sentiment and softness and what this
young man no doubt would call his social policy You cant eat
cake and have it This middleclass sentiment or socialism or
whatever it may be is rotten Masters are masters men are men
Yield one demand and they will make it six They are he smiles
grimly like Oliver Twist asking for more If I were in their
place I should be the same But I am not in their place Mark my
words one fine morning when you have given way here and given way
thereyou will find you have parted with the ground beneath your
feet and are deep in the bog of bankruptcy and with you
floundering in that bog will be the very men you have given way to
I have been accused of being a domineering tyrant thinking only of
my prideI am thinking of the future of this country threatened
with the black waters of confusion threatened with mob government
threatened with what I cannot see If by any conduct of mine I help
to bring this on us I shall be ashamed to look my fellows in the
face

 ANTHONY stares before him at what he cannot see and there is
 perfect stillness FROST comes in from the hall and all but
 ANTHONY look round at him uneasily

FROST To his master The men are here sir ANTHONY makes a
gesture of dismissal Shall I bring them in sir

ANTHONY Wait

 FROST goes out ANTHONY turns to face his son

I come to the attack that has been made upon me

 EDGAR with a gesture of deprecation remains motionless with
 his head a little bowed

A woman has died I am told that her blood is on my hands I am told
that on my hands is the starvation and the suffering of other women
and of children

EDGAR I said on our hands sir

ANTHONY It is the same His voice grows stronger and stronger
his feeling is more and more made manifest I am not aware that if
my adversary suffer in a fair fight not sought by me it is my fault
If I fall under his feetas fall I mayI shall not complain That
will be my lookoutand this ishis I cannot separate as I
would these men from their women and children A fair fight is a
fair fight Let them learn to think before they pick a quarrel

EDGAR In a low voice But is it a fair fight Father Look at
them and look at us Theyve only this one weapon

ANTHONY Grimly And youre weakkneed enough to teach them how
to use it It seems the fashion nowadays for men to take their
enemys side I have not learnt that art Is it my fault that they
quarrelled with their Union too

EDGAR There is such a thing as Mercy

ANTHONY And justice comes before it

EDGAR What seems just to one man sir is injustice to another

ANTHONY With suppressed passion You accuse me of injusticeof
what amounts to inhumanityof cruelty

 EDGAR makes a gesture of horrora general frightened
 movement

WANKLIN Come come Chairman

ANTHONY In a grim voice These are the words of my own son
They are the words of a generation that I dont understand the words
of a soft breed

 A general murmur With a violent effort ANTHONY recovers his
 control

EDGAR Quietly I said it of myself too Father

 A long look is exchanged between them and ANTHONY puts out his
 hand with a gesture as if to sweep the personalities away then
 places it against his brow swaying as though from giddiness
 There is a movement towards him He moves them back

ANTHONY Before I put this amendment to the Board I have one more
word to say He looks from face to face If it is carried it
means that we shall fail in what we set ourselves to do It means
that we shall fail in the duty that we owe to all Capital It means
that we shall fail in the duty that we owe ourselves It means that
we shall be open to constant attack to which we as constantly shall
have to yield Be under no misapprehensionrun this time and you
will never make a stand again You will have to fly like curs before
the whips of your own men If that is the lot you wish for you will
vote for this amendment

 He looks again from face to face finally resting his gaze on
 EDGAR all sit with their eyes on the ground ANTHONY makes a
 gesture and TENCH hands him the book He reads

Moved by Mr Wilder and seconded by Mr Wanklin That the mens
demands be placed at once in the hands of Mr Simon Harness for
settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning With
sudden vigour Those in favour Signify the same in the usual way

 For a minute no one moves then hastily just as ANTHONY is
 about to speak WILDERs hand and WANKLINS are held up then
 SCANTLEBURYS and last EDGARS who does not lift his head

 ANTHONY lifts his own hand

In a clear voice The amendment is carried I resign my position
on this Board

 ENID gasps and there is dead silence ANTHONY sits
 motionless his head slowly drooping suddenly he heaves as
 though the whole of his life had risen up within him

Contrary

Fifty years You have disgraced me gentlemen Bring in the men

 He sits motionless staring before him The Board draws
 hurriedly together and forms a group TENCH in a frightened
 manner speaks into the hall UNDERWOOD almost forces ENID from
 the room

WILDER Hurriedly Whats to be said to them Why isnt Harness
here Ought we to see the men before he comes I dont

TENCH Will you come in please

 Enter THOMAS GREEN BULGIN and ROUS who file up in a row
 past the little table TENCH sits down and writes All eyes
 are foxed on ANTHONY who makes no sign

WANKLIN Stepping up to the little table with nervous cordiality
Well Thomas hows it to be Whats the result of your meeting

ROUS Sim Harness has our answer Hell tell you what it is Were
waiting for him Hell speak for us

WANKLIN Is that so Thomas

THOMAS Sullenly Yes Roberts will not pe coming his wife is
dead

SCANTLEBURY Yes yes Poor woman Yes Yes

FROST Entering from the hall Mr Harness Sir

 As HARNESS enters he retires

 HARNESS has a piece of paper in his hand he bows to the
 Directors nods towards the men and takes his stand behind the
 little table in the very centre of the room

HARNESS Good evening gentlemen

 TENCH with the paper he has been writing joins him they
 speak together in low tones

WILDER Weve been waiting for you Harness Hope we shall come to
some

FROST Entering from the hall Roberts

 He goes

 ROBERTS comes hastily in and stands staring at ANTHONY His
 face is drawn and old

ROBERTS Mr Anthony I am afraid I am a little late I would have
been here in time but for something thathas happened To the
men Has anything been said

THOMAS No But man what made ye come

ROBERTS Ye told us this morning gentlemen to go away and
reconsider our position We have reconsidered it we are here to
bring you the mens answer To ANTHONY Go ye back to London We
have nothing for you By no jot or tittle do we abate our demands
nor will we until the whole of those demands are yielded

 ANTHONY looks at him but does not speak There is a movement
 amongst the men as though they were bewildered

HARNESS Roberts

ROBERTS Glancing fiercely at him and back to ANTHONY Is that
clear enough for ye Is it short enough and to the point Ye made a
mistake to think that we would come to heel Ye may break the body
but ye cannot break the spirit Get back to London the men have
nothing for ye

 Pausing uneasily he takes a step towards the unmoving ANTHONY

EDGAR Were all sorry for you Roberts but

ROBERTS Keep your sorrow young man Let your father speak

HARNESS With the sheet of paper in his hand speaking from behind
the little table Roberts

ROBERT TO ANTHONY with passionate intensity Why dont ye
answer

HARNESS Roberts

ROBERTS Turning sharply What is it

HARNESS Gravely Youre talking without the book things have
travelled past you

 He makes a sign to TENCH who beckons the Directors They
 quickly sign his copy of the terms

Look at this man Holding up his sheet of paper Demands
conceded with the exception of those relating to the engineers and
furnacemen Double wages for Saturdays overtime Nightshifts as
they are These terms have been agreed The men go back to work
again tomorrow The strike is at an end

ROBERTS Reading the paper and turning on the men They shrink
back from him all but ROUS who stands his ground With deadly
stillness Ye have gone back on me I stood by ye to the death ye
waited for that to throw me over

 The men answer all speaking together

ROUS Its a lie

THOMAS Ye were past endurance man

GREEN If yed listen to me

BULGIN Under his breath Hold your jaw

ROBERTS Ye waited for that

HARNESS Taking the Directors copy of the terms and handing his
own to TENCH Thats enough men You had better go

 The men shuffle slowly awkwardly away

WILDER In a low nervous voice Theres nothing to stay for now
I suppose He follows to the door I shall have a try for that
train Coming Scantlebury

SCANTLEBURY Following with WANKLIN Yes yes wait for me He
stops as ROBERTS speaks

ROBERTS To ANTHONY But ye have not signed them terms They
cant make terms without their Chairman Ye would never sign them
terms ANTHONY looks at him without speaking Dont tell me ye
have for the love o God With passionate appeal I reckoned on
ye

HARNESS Holding out the Directors copy of the teems The Board
has signed

 ROBERTS looks dully at the signaturesdashes the paper from
 him and covers up his eyes

SCANTLEBURY Behind his hand to TENCH Look after the Chairman
Hes not well hes not wellhe had no lunch If theres any fund
started for the women and children put me down forfor twenty
pounds

 He goes out into the hall in cumbrous haste and WANKLIN who
 has been staring at ROBERTS and ANTHONY With twitchings of his
 face follows EDGAR remains seated on the sofa looking at the
 ground TENCH returning to the bureau writes in his minute
 book HARNESS stands by the little table gravely watching
 ROBERTS

ROBERTS Then youre no longer Chairman of this Company Breaking
into halfmad laughter Ah haah ha ha Theyve thrown ye over
thrown over their Chairman Ahhaha With a sudden dreadful calm
Sotheyve done us both down Mr Anthony

 ENID hurrying through the doubledoors comes quickly to her
 father

ANTHONY Both broken men my friend Roberts

HARNESS Coming down and laying his hands on ROBERTSS sleeve
For shame Roberts Go home quietly man go home

ROBERTS Tearing his arm away Home Shrinking togetherin a
whisper Home

ENID Quietly to her father Come away dear Come to your room

 ANTHONY rises with an effort He turns to ROBERTS who looks at
 him They stand several seconds gazing at each other fixedly
 ANTHONY lifts his hand as though to salute but lets it fall
 The expression of ROBERTSS face changes from hostility to
 wonder They bend their heads in token of respect ANTHONY
 turns and slowly walks towards the curtained door Suddenly
 he sways as though about to fall recovers himself and is
 assisted out by EDGAR and ENID UNDERWOOD follows but stops at
 the door ROBERTS remains motionless for several seconds
 staring intently after ANTHONY then goes out into the hall

TENCH Approaching HARNESS Its a great weight off my mind Mr
Harness But what a painful scene sir He wipes his brow

 HARNESS pale and resolute regards with a grim halfsmile the
 quavering

TENCH Its all been so violent What did he mean by Done us both
down If he has lost his wife poor fellow he oughtnt to have
spoken to the Chairman like that

HARNESS A woman dead and the two best men both broken

TENCH Staring at himsuddenly excited Dyou know sirthese
terms theyre the very same we drew up together you and I and put
to both sides before the fight began All thisall thisandand
what for

HARNESS In a slow grim voice Thats where the fun comes in

 UNDERWOOD without turning from the door makes a gesture of
 assent


 The curtain falls

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
