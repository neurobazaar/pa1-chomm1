A FIRST FAMILY OF TASAJARA


By Bret Harte




CHAPTER I


It blows said Joe Wingate

As if to accent the words of the speaker a heavy gust of wind at that
moment shook the long light wooden structure which served as the general
store of Sidon settlement in Contra Costa Even after it had passed a
prolonged whistle came through the keyhole sides and openings of the
closed glass front doors that served equally for windows and filled
the canvas ceiling which hid the roof above like a bellying sail A wave
of enthusiastic emotion seemed to be communicated to a line of straw
hats and souwesters suspended from a crossbeam and swung them with
every appearance of festive rejoicing while a few dusters overcoats
and hickory shirts hanging on the side walls exhibited such marked
though idiotic animation that it had the effect of a satirical comment
on the lazy purposeless figures of the four living inmates of the
store

Ned Billings momentarily raised his head and shoulders depressed in the
back of his wooden armchair glanced wearily around said You bet
its no slouch of a storm and then lapsed again with further extended
legs and an added sense of comfort

Here the third figure which had been leaning listlessly against the
shelves putting aside the arm of a swaying overcoat that seemed to
be emptily embracing him walked slowly from behind the counter to the
door examined its fastenings and gazed at the prospect He was the
owner of the store and the view was a familiar onea long stretch of
treeless waste before him meeting an equal stretch of dreary sky above
and night hovering somewhere between the two This was indicated by
splashes of darker shadow as if washed in with india ink and a lighter
lowlying streak that might have been the horizon but was not To
the right on a line with the front door of the store were several
scattered widely dispersed objects that although vague in outline
were rigid enough in angles to suggest sheds or barns but certainly not
trees

Theres a heap more wet to come afore the wind goes down he said
glancing at the sky Hark to that now

They listened lazily There was a faint murmur from the shingles above
then suddenly the whole window was filmed and blurred as if the
entire prospect had been wiped out with a damp sponge The man turned
listlessly away

Thats the kind that soaks in thar wont be much teamin over Tasajara
for the next two weeks I reckon said the fourth lounger who
seated on a high barrel was nibblingalbeit critically and
fastidiouslybiscuits and dried apples alternately from open boxes on
the counter Its lucky youve got in your winter stock Harkutt

The shrewd eyes of Mr Harkutt proprietor glanced at the occupation of
the speaker as if even his foresight might have its possible drawbacks
but he said nothing

Therell be no show for Sidon until youve got a wagon road from here
to the creek said Billings languidly from the depths of his chair
But whats the use o talkin Thar aint energy enough in all Tasajara
to build it A Godforsaken place that two months of the year can only
be reached by a mailrider once a week dont look ez if it was goin to
break its back haulin in goods and settlers I tell ye what gentlemen
it makes me sick And apparently it had enfeebled him to the extent of
interfering with his aim in that expectoration of disgust against the
stove with which he concluded his sentence

Why dont YOU build it asked Wingate carelessly

I wouldnt on principle said Billings Its govment work What did
we whoop up things here last spring to elect Kennedy to the legislation
for What did I rig up my shed and a thousand feet of lumber for benches
at the barbecue for Why to get Kennedy elected and make him get a
bill passed for the road Thats MY share of building it if it comes to
that And I only wish some folks that blow enough about what oughter be
done to bulge out that ceiling would only do as much as I have done for
Sidon

As this remark seemed to have a personal as well as local application
the storekeeper diplomatically turned it Theres a good many as DONT
believe that a road from here to the creek is going to do any good to
Sidon Its very well to say the creek is an embarcadero but callin it
so dont put anough water into it to float a steamboat from the bay nor
clear out the reeds and tules in it Even if the State builds you roads
it aint got no call to make Tasajara Creek navigable for ye and as
that will cost as much as the road I dont see where the moneys comin
from for both

Theres water enough in front of Lige Curtiss shanty and his
location is only a mile along the bank returned Billings

Water enough for him to laze away his time fishin when hes sober and
deep enough to drown him when hes drunk said Wingate If you
call that an embarcadero you kin buy it any day from Ligetitle
possession and shanty thrown infor a demijohn o whiskey

The fourth man here distastefully threw back a halfnibbled biscuit
into the box and languidly slipped from the barrel to the floor
fastidiously flicking the crumbs from his clothes as he did so I
reckon somebodyll get it for nothing if Lige dont pull up mighty
soon Hell either go off his head with jimjams or jump into the creek
Hes about as near desprit as they make em and havin no partner to
look after him and him alone in the tules ther s no tellin WHAT he
may do

Billings stretched at full length in his chair here gurgled
derisively Despritketch him Why thats his little game Hes
jist playin off his desprit condition to frighten Sidon Whenever any
one asks him why he dont go to work whenever hes hard up for a drink
whenever hes had too much or too little hes workin that desprit
dodge and even talkin o killin himself Why look here he
continued momentarily raising himself to a sitting posture in his
disgust it was only last week he was over at Rawletts trying to
raise provisions and whiskey outer his water rights on the creek Fact
sirhad it all written down lawyerlike on paper Rawlett didnt
exactly see it in that light and told him so Then he up with the
desprit dodge and began to work that Said if he had to starve in a
swamp like a dog he might as well kill himself at once and would too
if he could afford the weppins Johnson said it was not a bad idea and
offered to lend him his revolver Bilson handed up his shotgun and
left it alongside of him and turned his head away consideratelike and
thoughtful while Rawlett handed him a box of rat pizon over the counter
in case he preferred suthin more quiet Well what did Lige do
Nothin Smiled kinder sickly looked sorter wild and shut up He
didnt suicide much No sir He didnt kill himselfnot he Why old
Bixbyand hes a deacon in good standinallowed in Liges hearin
and for Liges benefit that selfdestruction was better nor bad
example and proved it by Scripture too And yet Lige did nothin
Desprit Hes only desprit to laze around and fish all day off a log
in the tules and soak up with whiskey until betwixt fever an ague
and the jumps he kinder shakes hisself free o responsibility

A long silence followed it was somehow felt that the subject was
incongruously exciting Billings allowed himself to lapse again behind
the back of his chair Meantime it had grown so dark that the dull glow
of the stove was beginning to outline a faint halo on the ceiling even
while it plunged the further lines of shelves behind the counter into
greater obscurity

Time to light up Harkutt aint it said Wingate tentatively

Well I was reckoning ez its such a wild night there wouldnt be any
use keepin open and when you fellows left Id just shut up for good
and make things fast said Harkutt dubiously Before his guests had
time to fully weigh this delicate hint another gust of wind shook the
tenement and even forced the unbolted upper part of the door to yield
far enough to admit an eager current of humid air that seemed to justify
the wisdom of Harkutts suggestion Billings slowly and with a sigh
assumed a sitting posture in the chair The biscuitnibbler selected a
fresh dainty from the counter and Wingate abstractedly walked to the
window and rubbed the glass Sky and water had already disappeared
behind a curtain of darkness that was illuminated by a single point of
lightthe lamp in the window of some invisible but nearer housewhich
threw its rays across the glistening shallows in the road Well said
Wingate buttoning up his coat in slow dejection I reckon I oughter
be travelin to help the old woman do the chores before supper He had
just recognized the light in his own diningroom and knew by that sign
that his longwaiting helpmeet had finally done the chores herself

Some folks have it mighty easy said Billings with longdrawn
discontent as he struggled to his feet Youve only a step to go
and yers me and Peters thereindicating the biscuitnibbler who was
beginning to show alarming signs of returning to the barrel againhev
got to trapse five times that distance

Moren half a mile if it comes to that said Peters gloomily He
paused in putting on his overcoat as if thinking better of it while
even the more fortunate and contiguous Wingate languidly lapsed against
the counter again

The moment was a critical one Billings was evidently also regretfully
eying the chair he had just quitted Harkutt resolved on a heroic
effort

Come boys he said with brisk conviviality take a parting drink
with me before you go Producing a black bottle from some obscurity
beneath the counter that smelt strongly of indiarubber boots he placed
it with four glasses before his guests Each made a feint of holding his
glass against the opaque window while filling it although nothing could
be seen A sudden tumult of wind and rain again shook the building but
even after it had passed the glass door still rattled violently

Just see whats loose Peters said Billings youre nearest it

Peters still holding the undrained glass in his hand walked slowly
towards it

Its suthinor somebody outside he said hesitatingly

The three others came eagerly to his side Through the glass clouded
from within by their breath and filmed from without by the rain some
vague object was moving and what seemed to be a mop of tangled hair
was apparently brushing against the pane The door shook again but less
strongly Billings pressed his face against the glass Hol on he
said in a quick whisperits Lige But it was too late Harkutt
had already drawn the lower bolt and a man stumbled from the outer
obscurity into the darker room

The inmates drew away as he leaned back for a moment against the door
that closed behind him Then dimly but instinctively discerning the
glass of liquor which Wingate still mechanically held in his hand
he reached forward eagerly took it from Wingates surprised and
unresisting fingers and drained it at a gulp The four men laughed
vaguely but not as cheerfully as they might

I was just shutting up began Harkutt dubiously

I wont keep you a minit said the intruder nervously fumbling in
the breast pocket of his hickory shirt Its a matter of
businessHarkuttIBut he was obliged to stop here to wipe his
face and forehead with the ends of a loose handkerchief tied round his
throat From the action and what could be seen of his pale
exhausted face it was evident that the moisture upon it was beads of
perspiration and not the rain which some abnormal heat of his body was
converting into vapor from his sodden garments as he stood there

Ive got a document here he began again producing a roll of paper
tremblingly from his pocket that Id like you to glance over and
perhaps youdHis voice which had been feverishly exalted here broke
and rattled with a cough

Billings Wingate and Peters fell apart and looked out of the window
Its too dark to read anything now Lige said Harkutt with evasive
good humor and I aint lightin up tonight

But I can tell you the substance of it said the man with a faintness
that however had all the distinctness of a whisper if youll just step
inside a minute Its a matter of importance and a bargain

I reckon we must be goin said Billings to the others with marked
emphasis Were keepin Harkutt from shuttin up Goodnight
Goodnight added Peters and Wingate ostentatiously following
Billings hurriedly through the door So long

The door closed behind them leaving Harkutt alone with his importunate
intruder Possibly his resentment at his customers selfish abandonment
of him at this moment developed a vague spirit of opposition to them and
mitigated his feeling towards Lige He groped his way to the counter
struck a match and lit a candle Its feeble rays faintly illuminated
the pale drawn face of the applicant set in a tangle of wet unkempt
partycolored hair It was not the face of an ordinary drunkard
although tremulous and sensitive from some artificial excitement there
was no ENGORGEMENT or congestion in the features or complexion albeit
they were morbid and unhealthy The expression was of a suffering that
was as much mental as physical and yet in some vague way appeared
unmeaningand unheroic

I want to see you about selling my place on the creek I want you to
take it off my hands for a bargain I want to get quit of it at once
for just enough to take me out o this I dont want any profit only
money enough to get away His utterance which had a certain kind of
cultivation here grew thick and harsh again and he looked eagerly at
the bottle which stood on the counter

Look here Lige said Harkutt not unkindly Its too late to do
anythin tonight You come in tomorrow He would have added when
youre sober but for a traders sense of politeness to a possible
customer and probably some doubt of the mans actual condition

God knows where or what I may be tomorrow It would kill me to go back
and spend another night as the last if I dont kill myself on the way
to do it

Harkutts face darkened grimly It was indeed as Billings had said
The pitiable weakness of the mans manner not only made his desperation
inadequate and ineffective but even lent it all the cheapness of
acting And as if to accent his simulation of a part his fingers
feebly groping in his shirt bosom slipped aimlessly and helplessly
from the shining handle of a pistol in his pocket to wander hesitatingly
towards the bottle on the counter

Harkutt took the bottle poured out a glass of the liquor and pushed
it before his companion who drank it eagerly Whether it gave him more
confidence or his attention was no longer diverted he went on
more collectedly and cheerfully and with no trace of his previous
desperation in his manner Come Harkutt buy my place Its a bargain
I tell you Ill sell it cheap I only want enough to get away with
Give me twentyfive dollars and its yours See theres the papersthe
quitclaimall drawn up and signed He drew the roll of paper from his
pocket again apparently forgetful of the adjacent weapon

Look here Lige said Harkutt with a businesslike straightening of
his lips I aint buyin any land in Tasajaraleast of all yours on
the creek Ive got more invested here already than Ill ever get back
again But I tell you what Ill do You say you cant go back to your
shanty Well seein how rough it is outside and that the waters of
the creek are probably all over the trail by this time I reckon youre
about right Now theres five dollars He laid down a coin sharply on
the counter Take that and go over to Rawletts and get a bed and
some supper In the mornin you may be able to strike up a trade with
somebody elseor change your mind How did you get here On your hoss

Yes

He aint starved yet

No he can eat grass I cant

Either the liquor or Harkutts practical unsentimental treatment of
the situation seemed to give him confidence He met Harkutts eye more
steadily as the latter went on You kin turn your hoss for the night
into my stock corral next to Rawletts Itll save you payin for fodder
and stablin

The man took up the coin with a certain slow gravity which was almost
like dignity Thank you he said laying the paper on the counter
Ill leave that as security

Dont want it Lige said Harkutt pushing it back

Id rather leave it

But suppose you have a chance to sell it to somebody at Rawletts
continued Harkutt with a precaution that seemed ironical

I dont think theres much chance of that

He remained quiet looking at Harkutt with an odd expression as
he rubbed the edge of the coin that he held between his fingers
abstractedly on the counter Something in his gazerather perhaps
the apparent absence of anything in it approximate to the present
occasionwas beginning to affect Harkutt with a vague uneasiness
Providentially a resumed onslaught of wind and rain against the panes
effected a diversion Come he said with brisk practicality youd
better hurry on to Rawletts before it gets worse Have your clothes
dried by his fire take suthin to eat and youll be all right He
rubbed his hands cheerfully as if summarily disposing of the situation
and incidentally of all Liges troubles and walked with him to the
door Nevertheless as the mans look remained unchanged he hesitated
a moment with his hand on the handle in the hope that he would say
something even if only to repeat his appeal but he did not Then
Harkutt opened the door the man moved mechanically out and at the
distance of a few feet seemed to melt into the rain and darkness
Harkutt remained for a moment with his face pressed against the glass
After an interval he thought he heard the faint splash of hoofs in the
shallows of the road he opened the door softly and looked out

The light had disappeared from the nearest house only an uncertain bulk
of shapeless shadows remained Other remoter and more vague outlines
near the horizon seemed to have a funereal suggestion of tombs and grave
mounds and onea low shed near the roadlooked not unlike a halted
bier He hurriedly put up the shutters in a momentary lulling of the
wind and reentering the store began to fasten them from within

While thus engaged an inner door behind the counter opened softly and
cautiously projecting a brighter light into the deserted apartment from
some sacred domestic interior with the warm and wholesome incense of
cooking It served to introduce also the equally agreeable presence of a
young girl who after assuring herself of the absence of every one but
the proprietor idly slipped into the store and placing her rounded
elbows from which her sleeves were uprolled upon the counter leaned
lazily upon them with both hands supporting her dimpled chin and gazed
indolently at him so indolently that with her pretty face once
fixed in this comfortable attitude she was constrained to follow his
movements with her eyes alone and often at an uncomfortable angle It
was evident that she offered the final but charming illustration of the
enfeebling listlessness of Sidon

So those loafers have gone at last she said meditatively Theyll
take root here some day pop The idea of three strong men like that
lazing round for two mortal hours doin nothin Well As if to
emphasize her disgust she threw her whole weight upon the counter by
swinging her feet from the floor to touch the shelves behind her

Mr Harkutt only replied by a slight grunt as he continued to screw on
the shutters

Want me to help you dad she said without moving

Mr Harkutt muttered something unintelligible which however seemed to
imply a negative and her attention here feebly wandered to the roll of
paper and she began slowly and lazily to read it aloud

For value received I hereby sell assign and transfer to Daniel D
Harkutt all my right titles and interest in and to the undivided
half of Quarter Section 4 Range 5 Tasajara Townshiphumhum she
murmured running her eyes to the bottom of the page Why Lord Its
that Lige Curtis she laughed The idea of HIM having property Why
dad you aint been THAT silly

Put down that paper miss he said aggrievedly bring the candle
here and help me to find one of these infernal screws thats dropped

The girl indolently disengaged herself from the counter and Elijah
Curtiss transfer and brought the candle to her father The screw was
presently found and the last fastening secured Supper gettin cold
dad she said with a slight yawn Her father sympathetically responded
by stretching himself from his stooping position and the two passed
through the private door into inner domesticity leaving the already
forgotten paper lying with other articles of barter on the counter




CHAPER II


With the closing of the little door behind them they seemed to have shut
out the turmoil and vibration of the storm The reason became apparent
when after a few paces they descended half a dozen steps to a lower
landing This disclosed the fact that the dwelling part of the Sidon
General Store was quite below the level of the shop and the road and
on the slope of the solitary undulation of the Tasajara plaina little
ravine that fell away to a brawling stream below The only arboreous
growth of Tasajara clothed its banks in the shape of willows and alders
that set compactly around the quaint irregular dwelling which straggled
down the ravine and looked upon a slope of bracken and foliage on either
side The transition from the black treeless stormswept plain to this
sheltered declivity was striking and suggestive From the opposite bank
one might fancy that the youthful and original dwelling had ambitiously
mounted the crest but appalled at the dreary prospect beyond had
gone no further while from the road it seemed as if the fastidious
proprietor had tried to draw a line between the vulgar tradingpost
with which he was obliged to face the coarser civilization of the place
and the privacy of his domestic life The real fact however was that
the ravine furnished wood and water and as Nature also provided one
wall of the houseas in the wellknown example of aboriginal cave
dwellingsits peculiar construction commended itself to Sidon on the
ground of involving little labor

Howbeit from the two open windows of the sittingroom which they had
entered only the faint pattering of dripping boughs and a slight murmur
from the swollen brook indicated the storm that shook the upper plain
and the cool breath of laurel syringa and alder was wafted through
the neat apartment Passing through that pleasant rural atmosphere
they entered the kitchen a much larger room which appeared to serve
occasionally as a diningroom and where supper was already laid out
A stout comfortablelooking womanwho had however a singularly
permanent expression of pained sympathy upon her facewelcomed them in
tones of gentle commiseration

Ah there you be you two Now sit ye right down dears DO You
must be tired out and you Phemie love draw up by your poor father
Therethats right Youll be better soon

There was certainly no visible sign of suffering or exhaustion on the
part of either father or daughter nor the slightest apparent earthly
reason why they should be expected to exhibit any But as already
intimated it was part of Mrs Harkutts generous idiosyncrasy to look
upon all humanity as suffering and toiling to be petted humored
condoled with and fed It had in the course of years imparted a
singularly caressing sadness to her voice and given her the habit of
ending her sentences with a melancholy cooing and an unintelligible
murmur of agreement It was undoubtedly sincere and sympathetic but at
times inappropriate and distressing It had lost her the friendship of
the one humorist of Tasajara whose best jokes she had received with
such heartfelt commiseration and such pained appreciation of the evident
labor involved as to reduce him to silence

Accustomed as Mr Harkutt was to his wifes peculiarity he was not
above assuming a certain slightly fatigued attitude befitting it Yes
he said with a vague sigh wheres Clemmie

Lyin down since dinner she reckoned she wouldnt get up to supper
she returned soothingly Phemies goin to take her up some sass and
tea The poor dear child wants a change

She wants to go to Frisco and so do I pop said Phemie leaning
her elbow half over her fathers plate Come pop say dojust for a
week

Only for a week murmured the commiserating Mrs Harkutt

Perhaps responded Harkutt with gloomy sarcasm ye wouldnt mind
tellin me how youre goin to get there and where the moneys comin
from to take you Theres no teamin over Tasajara till the rain stops
and no money comin in till the ranchmen can move their stuff There
aint a hundred dollars in all Tasajara at least there aint been the
first red cent of it paid across my counter for a fortnit Perhaps if
you do go you wouldnt mind takin me and the store along with ye and
leavin us there

Yes dear said Mrs Harkutt with sympathetic but shameless
tergiversation Dont bother your poor father Phemie love dont you
see hes just tired out And youre not eatin anything dad

As Mr Harkutt was uneasily conscious that he had been eating heartily
in spite of his financial difficulties he turned the subject abruptly
Wheres John Milton

Mrs Harkutt shaded her eyes with her hand and gazed meditatively on
the floor before the fire and in the chimney corner for her only son
baptized under that historic title He was here a minit ago she said
doubtfully I really cant think where hes gone But assuringly it
aint far

Hes skipped with one o those storybooks hes borrowed said Phemie
Hes always doin it Like as not hes reading with a candle in the
woodshed Well all be burnt up some night

But hes got through his chores interposed Mrs Harkutt
deprecatingly

Yes continued Harkutt aggrievedly but instead of goin to bed or
addin up bills or takin count o stock or even doin sums or suthin
useful hes ruinin his eyes and wastin his time over trash He rose
and walked slowly into the sittingroom followed by his daughter and a
murmur of commiseration from his wife But Mrs Harkutts ministration
for the present did not pass beyond her domain the kitchen

I reckon ye aint expectin anybody tonight Phemie said Mr Harkutt
sinking into a chair and placing his slippered feet against the wall

No said Phemie unless something possesses that sappy little Parmlee
to make one of his visitations John Milton says that out on the road
it blows so you cant stand up Its just like that idiot Parmlee to be
blown in here and not have strength of mind enough to get away again

Mr Harkutt smiled It was that arch yet approving severe yet
satisfied smile with which the deceived male parent usually receives any
depreciation of the ordinary young man by his daughters Euphemia was
no giddy thing to be carried away by young mens attentionsnot
she Sitting back comfortably in his rockingchair he said Play
something

The young girl went to the closet and took from the top shelf an
excessively ornamented accordionthe opulent gift of a reckless
admirer It was so inordinately decorated so gorgeous in the blaze of
papier mache motherofpearl and tortoiseshell on keys and keyboard
and so ostentatiously radiant in the pink silk of its bellows that it
seemed to overawe the plainly furnished room with its splendors You
ought to keep it on the table in a glass vase Phemie said her father
admiringly

And have HIM think I worshiped it Not me indeed Hes conceited
enough already she returned saucily

Mr Harkutt again smiled his approbation then deliberately closed his
eyes and threw his head back in comfortable anticipation of the coming
strains

It is to be regretted that in brilliancy finish and even cheerfulness
of quality they were not up to the suggestions of the keys and keyboard
The most discreet and cautious effort on the part of the young performer
seemed only to produce startlingly unexpected but instantly suppressed
complaints from the instrument accompanied by impatient interjections
of No no from the girl herself Nevertheless with her pretty
eyebrows knitted in some charming distress of memory her little mouth
half open between an apologetic smile and the exertion of working the
bellows with her white rounded arms partly lifted up and waving
before her she was pleasantly distracting to the eye Gradually as the
scattered strains were marshaled into something like an air she began
to sing also glossing over the instrumental weaknesses filling
in certain dropped notes and omissions and otherwise assisting the
ineffectual accordion with a youthful but not unmusical voice The song
was a lugubrious religious chant under its influence the house seemed
to sink into greater quiet permitting in the intervals the murmur of
the swollen creek to appear more distinct and even the far moaning of
the wind on the plain to become faintly audible At last having fairly
mastered the instrument Phemie got into the full swing of the chant
Unconstrained by any criticism carried away by the sound of her own
voice and perhaps a youthful love for mere uproar or possibly desirous
to drown her fathers voice which had unexpectedly joined in with a
discomposing bass the conjoined utterances seemed to threaten the frail
structure of their dwelling even as the gale had distended the store
behind them When they ceased at last it was in an accession of dripping
from the apparently stirred leaves outside And then a voice evidently
from the moist depths of the abyss below called out

Hullo there

Phemie put down the accordion said Whos that now went to the
window lazily leaned her elbows on the sill and peered into the
darkness Nothing was to be seen the open space of dimly outlined
landscape had that blank uncommunicative impenetrability with which
Nature always confronts and surprises us at such moments It seemed to
Phemie that she was the only human being present Yet after the feeling
had passed she fancied she heard the wash of the current against some
object in the stream half stationary and half resisting

Is any one down there Is that you Mr Parmlee she called

There was a pause Some invisible auditor said to another Its a young
lady Then the first voice rose again in a more deferential tone Are
we anywhere near Sidon

This is Sidon answered Harkutt who had risen and was now quite
obliterating his daughters outline at the window

Thank you said the voice Can we land anywhere here on this bank

Run down pop theyre strangers said the girl with excited almost
childish eagerness

Hold on called out Harkutt Ill be thar in a moment He hastily
thrust his feet into a pair of huge boots clapped on an oilskin hat
and waterproof and disappeared through a door that led to a lower
staircase Phemie still at the window albeit with a newly added sense
of selfconsciousness hung out breathlessly Presently a beam of light
from the lower depths of the house shot out into the darkness It was
her father with a bullseye lantern As he held it up and clambered
cautiously down the bank its rays fell upon the turbid rushing stream
and what appeared to be a rough raft of logs held with difficulty
against the bank by two men with long poles In its centre was a roll
of blankets a valise and saddlebags and the shining brasses of some
oddlooking instruments

As Mr Harkutt supporting himself by a willow branch that overhung
the current held up the lantern the two men rapidly transferred their
freight from the raft to the bank and leaped ashore The action gave
an impulse to the raft which no longer held in position by the
poles swung broadside to the current and was instantly swept into the
darkness

Not a word had been spoken but now the voices of the men rose freely
together Phemie listened with intense expectation The explanation
was simple They were surveyors who had been caught by the overflow
on Tasajara plain had abandoned their horses on the bank of Tasajara
Creek and with a hastily constructed raft had intrusted themselves and
their instruments to the current But said Harkutt quickly there is
no connection between Tasajara Creek and this stream

The two men laughed There is NOW said one of them

But Tasajara Creek is a part of the bay said the astonished Harkutt
and this stream rises inland and only runs into the bay four miles
lower down And I dont see how

Youre almost twelve feet lower here than Tasajara Creek said the
first man with a certain professional authority and thats WHY
Theres more water than Tasajara Creek can carry and its seeking the
bay this way Look he continued taking the lantern from Harkutts
hand and casting its rays on the stream thats salt drift from the
upper bay and part of Tasajara Creeks running by your house now Dont
be alarmed he added reassuringly glancing at the staring storekeeper
Youre all right here this is only the overflow and will find its
level soon

But Mr Harkutt remained gazing abstractedly at the smiling speaker
From the window above the impatient Phemie was wondering why he kept
the strangers waiting in the rain while he talked about things that were
perfectly plain It was so like a man

Then theres a waterway straight to Tasajara Creek he said slowly

There is as long as this flood lasts returned the first speaker
promptly and a cutting through the bank of two or three hundred yards
would make it permanent Well whats the matter with that

Nothin said Harkutt hurriedly I am only considerin But come in
dry yourselves and take suthin

The light over the rushing water was withdrawn and the whole prospect
sank back into profound darkness Mr Harkutt had disappeared with
his guests Then there was the familiar shuffle of his feet on
the staircase followed by other more cautious footsteps that grew
delicately and even courteously deliberate as they approached At which
the young girl in some new sense of decorum drew in her pretty head
glanced around the room quickly reset the tidy on her fathers chair
placed the resplendent accordion like an ornament in the exact centre of
the table and then vanished into the hall as Mr Harkutt entered with
the strangers

They were both of the same age and appearance but the principal speaker
was evidently the superior of his companion and although their attitude
to each other was equal and familiar it could be easily seen that
he was the leader He had a smooth beardless face with a critical
expression of eye and mouth that might have been fastidious and
supercilious but for the kindly humorous perception that tempered
it His quick eye swept the apartment and then fixed itself upon the
accordion but a smile lit up his face as he said quietly

I hope we havent frightened the musician away It was bad enough to
have interrupted the young lady

No no said Mr Harkutt who seemed to have lost his abstraction in
the nervousness of hospitality I reckon shes only lookin after her
sick sister But come into the kitchen both of you straight off and
while youre dryin your clothes motherll fix you suthin hot

We only need to change our boots and stockings weve some dry ones in
our pack downstairs said the first speaker hesitatingly

Ill fetch em up and you can change in the kitchen The old woman
wont mind said Harkutt reassuringly Come along He led the way to
the kitchen the two strangers exchanged a glance of humorous perplexity
and followed

The quiet of the little room was once more unbroken A faroff
commiserating murmur indicated that Mrs Harkutt was receiving her
guests The cool breath of the wet leaves without slightly stirred the
white dimity curtains and somewhere from the darkened eaves there was
a still somnolent drip Presently a hurried whisper and a halflaugh
appeared to be suppressed in the outer passage or hall There
was another moment of hesitation and the door opened suddenly and
ostentatiously disclosing Phemie with a taller and slighter young
woman her elder sister at her side Perceiving that the room was
empty they both said Oh yet with a certain artificiality of manner
that was evidently a lingering trace of some previous formal attitude
they had assumed Then without further speech they each selected a
chair and a position having first shaken out their dresses and gazed
silently at each other

It may be said briefly that sitting thusin spite of their unnatural
attitude or perhaps rather because of its suggestion of a photographic
posethey made a striking picture and strongly accented their separate
peculiarities They were both pretty but the taller girl apparently
the elder had an ideal refinement and regularity of feature which was
not only unlike Phemie but gratuitously unlike the rest of her family
and as hopelessly and even wantonly inconsistent with her surroundings
as was the elaborately ornamented accordion on the centretable She was
one of those occasional creatures episodical in the South and West
who might have been stamped with some vague antenatal impression of a
mother given to oversentimental contemplation of books of beauty and
albums rather than the family features offspring of typical men and
women and yet themselves incongruous to any known local or even general
type The long swanlike neck tendriled hair swimming eyes and small
patrician head had never lived or moved before in Tasajara or the
West nor perhaps even existed except as a personified Constancy
Meditation or the Barons Bride in mezzotint or copperplate Even
the girls common pink print dress with its high sleeves and shoulders
could not conventionalize these original outlines and the hand that
rested stiffly on the back of her chair albeit neither overwhite nor
well kept looked as if it had never held anything but a lyre a rose
or a good book Even the few sprays of wild jessamine which she had
placed in the coils of her waving hair although a local fashion became
her as a special ornament

The two girls kept their constrained and artificially elaborated
attitude for a few moments accompanied by the murmur of voices in the
kitchen the monotonous drip of the eaves before the window and the
faroff sough of the wind Then Phemie suddenly broke into a constrained
giggle which she however quickly smothered as she had the accordion
and with the same look of mischievous distress

Im astonished at you Phemie said Clementina in a deep contralto
voice which seemed even deeper from its restraint You dont seem to
have any sense Anybodyd think you never had seen a stranger before

Saw him before you did retorted Phemie pertly But here a pushing
of chairs and shuffling of feet in the kitchen checked her Clementina
fixed an abstracted gaze on the ceiling Phemie regarded a leaf on
the window sill with photographic rigidity as the door opened to the
strangers and her father

The look of undisguised satisfaction which lit the young mens faces
relieved Mr Harkutts awkward introduction of any embarrassment and
almost before Phemie was fully aware of it she found herself talking
rapidly and in a high key with Mr Lawrence Grant the surveyor while
her sister was equally although more sedately occupied with Mr
Stephen Rice his assistant But the enthusiasm of the strangers and
the desire to please and be pleased was so genuine and contagious that
presently the accordion was brought into requisition and Mr Grant
exhibited a surprising faculty of accompaniment to Mr Rices tenor in
which both the girls joined

Then a game of cards with partners followed into which the rival
parties introduced such delightful and shameless obviousness of
cheating and displayed such fascinating and exaggerated partisanship
that the game resolved itself into a hilarious melee to which peace was
restored only by an exhibition of tricks of legerdemain with the
cards by the young surveyor All of which Mr Harkutt supervised
patronizingly with occasional fits of abstraction from his
rockingchair and later Mrs Harkutt from her kitchen threshold wiping
her arms on her apron and commiseratingly observing that she declared
the young folks looked better already

But it was here a more dangerous element of mystery and suggestion was
added by Mr Lawrence Grant in the telling of Miss Euphemias fortune
from the cards before him and that young lady pink with excitement
fluttered her little hands not unlike timid birds over the cards to be
drawn taking them from him with an audible twitter of anxiety and
great doubts whether a certain fairhaired gentleman was in hearts or
diamonds

Here are two strangers said Mr Grant with extraordinary gravity
laying down the cards and here is a journey this is unexpected
news and this ten of diamonds means great wealth to you which you
see follows the advent of the two strangers and is some way connected
with them

Oh indeed said the young lady with great pertness and a toss of her
head I suppose theyve got the money with them

No though it reaches you through them he answered with unflinching
solemnity Wait a bit I have it I see Ive made a mistake with this
card It signifies a journey or a road Queer isnt it Steve Its THE
ROAD

It is queer said Rice with equal gravity but its so The road
sure Nevertheless he looked up into the large eyes of Clementina with
a certain confidential air of truthfulness

You see ladies continued the surveyor appealing to them with
unabashed rigidity of feature the cards dont lie Luckily we are in
a position to corroborate them The road in question is a secret known
only to us and some capitalists in San Francisco In fact even THEY
dont know that it is feasible until WE report to them But I dont mind
telling you now as a slight return for your charming hospitality that
the road is a RAILROAD from Oakland to Tasajara Creek of which weve
just made the preliminary survey So you see what the cards mean is
this Youre not far from Tasajara Creek in fact with a very little
expense your father could connect this stream with the creek and have a
WATERWAY STRAIGHT TO THE RAILROAD TERMINUS Thats the wealth the cards
promise and if your father knows how to take a hint he can make his
fortune

It was impossible to say which was the most dominant in the face of the
speaker the expression of assumed gravity or the twinkling of humor in
his eyes The two girls with superior feminine perception divined
that there was much truth in what he said albeit they didnt
entirely understand it and what they did understandexcept the mans
goodhumored motivewas not particularly interesting In fact they
were slightly disappointed What had promised to be an audaciously
flirtatious declaration and even a mischievous suggestion of marriage
had resolved itself into something absurdly practical and businesslike

Not so Mr Harkutt He quickly rose from his chair and leaning over
the table with his eyes fixed on the card as if it really signified the
railroad repeated quickly Railroad eh Whats that A railroad to
Tasajara Creek Ye dont mean itThat isit aint a SURE thing

Perfectly sure The money is ready in San Francisco now and by this
time next year

A railroad to Tasajara Creek continued Harkutt hurriedly What part
of it Where

At the embarcadero naturally responded Grant There isnt but the
one place for the terminus Theres an old shanty there now belongs to
somebody

Why pop said Phemie with sudden recollection aint it Lige
Curtiss house The land he offered

Hush said her father

You know the one written in that bit of paper continued the innocent
Phemie

Hush will you God Amighty are you goin to mind me Are you goin
to keep up your jabber when Im speakin to the gentlemen Is that your
manners What next I wonder

The sudden and unexpected passion of the speaker the incomprehensible
change in his voice and the utterly disproportionate exaggeration of
his attitude towards his daughters enforced an instantaneous silence
The rain began to drip audibly at the window the rush of the river
sounded distinctly from without even the shaking of the front part
of the dwelling by the distant gale became perceptible An angry flash
sprang for an instant to the young assistants eye but it met the
cautious glance of his friend and together both discreetly sought the
table The two girls alone remained white and collected Will you go on
with my fortune Mr Grant said Phemie quietly

A certain respect perhaps not before observable was suggested in the
surveyors tone as he smilingly replied Certainly I was only waiting
for you to show your confidence in me and took up the cards

Mr Harkutt coughed It looks as if that blamed wind had blown suthin
loose in the store he said affectedly I reckon Ill go and see He
hesitated a moment and then disappeared in the passage Yet even here he
stood irresolute looking at the closed door behind him and passing his
hand over his still flushed face Presently he slowly and abstractedly
ascended the flight of steps entered the smaller passage that led to
the back door of the shop and opened it

He was at first a little startled at the halo of light from the
still glowing stove which the greater obscurity of the long room had
heightened rather than diminished Then he passed behind the counter
but here the box of biscuits which occupied the centre and cast a shadow
over it compelled him to grope vaguely for what he sought Then he
stopped suddenly the paper he had just found dropping from his fingers
and said sharply

Whos there

Me pop

John Milton

Yes sir

What the devil are you doin there sir

Readin

It was true The boy was half reclining in a most distorted posture on
two chairs his figure in deep shadow but his book was raised above his
head so as to catch the red glow of the stove on the printed page
Even then his fathers angry interruption scarcely diverted his
preoccupation he raised himself in his chair mechanically with his
eyes still fixed on his book Seeing which his father quickly regained
the paper but continued his objurgation

How dare you Clear off to bed will you Do you hear me Pretty
goins on he added as if to justify his indignation Sneakin in here
andand lyin round at this time o night Why if I hadnt come in
here to

What asked the boy mechanically catching vaguely at the unfinished
sentence and staring automatically at the paper in his fathers hand

Nothin sir Go to bed I tell you Will you What are you standin
gawpin at continued Harkutt furiously

The boy regained his feet slowly and passed his father but not without
noticing with the same listless yet ineffaceable perception of childhood
that he was hurriedly concealing the paper in his pocket With the same
youthful inconsequence wondering at this more than at the interruption
which was no novel event he went slowly out of the room

Harkutt listened to the retreating tread of his bare feet in the passage
and then carefully locked the door Taking the paper from his pocket
and borrowing the idea he had just objurgated in his son he turned it
towards the dull glow of the stove and attempted to read it But perhaps
lacking the patience as well as the keener sight of youth he was forced
to relight the candle which he had left on the counter and reperused
the paper Yes there was certainly no mistake Here was the actual
description of the property which the surveyor had just indicated as
the future terminus of the new railroad and here it was conveyed to
himDaniel Harkutt What was that Somebody knocking What did this
continual interruption mean An odd superstitious fear now mingled with
his irritation

The sound appeared to come from the front shutters It suddenly
occurred to him that the light might be visible through the crevices He
hurriedly extinguished it and went to the door

Whos there

MePeters Want to speak to you

Mr Harkutt with evident reluctance drew the bolts The wind still
boisterous and besieging did the rest and precipitately propelled
Peters through the carefully guarded opening But his surprise at
finding himself in the darkness seemed to forestall any explanation of
his visit

Well he said with an odd mingling of reproach and suspicion I
declare I saw a light here just this minit Thats queer

Yes I put it out just now I was goin away replied Harkutt with
illdisguised impatience

What been here ever since

No said Harkutt curtly

Well I want to speak to ye about Lige Seein the candle shinin
through the chinks I thought he might be still with ye If he aint it
looks bad Light up cant ye I want to show you something

There was a peremptoriness in his tone that struck Harkutt disagreeably
but observing that he was carrying something in his hand he somewhat
nervously relit the candle and faced him Peters had a hat in his hand
It was Liges

Bout an hour after we fellers left here said Peters I heard the
rattlin of hoofs on the road and then it seemed to stop just by my
house I went out with a lantern and darn my skin if there warnt
Liges hoss the saddle empty and Lige nowhere I looked round and
called himbut nothing were to be seen Thinkin he might have slipped
offtho ez a general rule drunken men dont and he is a good riderI
followed down the road lookin for him I kept on follerin it down to
your run half a mile below

But began Harkutt with a quick nervous laugh you dont reckon that
because of that he

Hold on said Peters grimly producing a revolver from his sidepocket
with the stock and barrel clogged and streaked with mud I found THAT
tooand look one barrel discharged And he added hurriedly as
approaching a climax look yewhat I natrally took for wet from the
raininside that hatwasblood

Nonsense said Harkutt putting the hat aside with a new
fastidiousness You dont think

I think said Peters lowering his voice I think by God HES BIN
AND DONE IT

No

Sure Oh its all very well for Billings and the rest of that
conceited crowd to sneer and sling their ideas of Lige genrally as
they did jess now herebut Id like em to see THAT It was difficult
to tell if Mr Peters triumphant delight in confuting his late
companions theories had not even usurped in his mind the importance of
the news he brought as it had of any human sympathy with it

Look here returned Harkutt earnestly yet with a singularly cleared
brow and a more natural manner You ought to take them things over to
Squire Kerbys right off and show em to him You kin tell him how you
left Lige here and say that I can prove by my daughter that he went
away about ten minutes afterat least not more than fifteen Like
all unprofessional humanity Mr Harkutt had an exaggerated conception
of the majesty of unimportant detail in the eye of the law Id go with
you myself he added quickly but Ive got companystrangershere

How did he look when he leftkinder wild suggested Peters

Harkutt had begun to feel the prudence of present reticence Well he
said cautiously YOU saw how he looked

You wasnt rough with himthat might have sent him off you know
said Peters

No said Harkutt forgetting himself in a quick indignation no
I not only treated him to another drink but gave himhe stopped
suddenly and awkwardly

Eh said Peters

Some good adviceyou know said Harkutt hastily But come youd
better hurry over to the squires You know YOUVE made the discovery
YOUR evidence is important and theres a law that obliges you to give
information at once

The excitement of discovery and the triumph over his disputants being
spent Peters after the Sidon fashion evidently did not relish
activity as a duty You know he said dubiously he mightnt be dead
after all

Harkutt became a trifle distant You know your own opinion of the
thing he replied after a pause Youve circumstantial evidence
enough to see the squire and set others to work on it and he added
significantly youve done your share then and can wipe your hands of
it eh

Thats so said Peters eagerly Ill just run over to the squire

And on account of the women folks you know and the strangers here
Ill say nothin about it tonight added Harkutt

Peters nodded his head and taking up the hat of the unfortunate Elijah
with a certain hesitation as if he feared it had already lost its
dramatic intensity as a witness disappeared into the storm and darkness
again A lurking gust of wind lying in ambush somewhere seemed to swoop
down on him as if to prevent further indecision and whirl him away in
the direction of the justices house and Mr Harkutt shut the door
bolted it and walked aimlessly back to the counter

From a slow deliberate and cautious man he seemed to have changed
within an hour to an irresolute and capricious one He took the paper
from his pocket and unlocking the money drawer of his counter folded
into a small compass that which now seemed to be the last testament of
Elijah Curtis and placed it in a recess Then he went to the back door
and paused then returned reopened the money drawer took out the
paper and again buttoned it in his hip pocket standing by the stove and
staring abstractedly at the dull glow of the fire He even went through
the mechanical process of raking down the ashessolely to gain time
and as an excuse for delaying some other necessary action

He was thinking what he should do Had the question of his right to
retain and make use of that paper been squarely offered to him an hour
ago he would without doubt have decided that he ought not to keep it
Even now looking at it as an abstract principle he did not deceive
himself in the least But Nature has the reprehensible habit of
not presenting these questions to us squarely and fairly and it is
remarkable that in most of our offending the abstract principle is never
the direct issue Mr Harkutt was conscious of having been unwillingly
led step by step into a difficult not to say dishonest situation
and against his own seeking He had never asked Elijah to sell him the
property he had distinctly declined it it had even been forced upon
him as security for the pittance he so freely gave him This proved to
himself that he himself was honest it was only the circumstances that
were queer Of course if Elijah had lived he Harkutt might have tried
to drive some bargain with him before the news of the railroad survey
came outfor THAT was only business But now that Elijah was dead who
would be a penny the worse or better but himself if he chose to consider
the whole thing as a lucky speculation and his gift of five dollars as
the price he paid for it Nobody could think that he had calculated upon
Liges suicide any more than that the property would become valuable
In fact if it came to that if Lige had really contemplated killing
himself as a hopeless bankrupt after taking Harkutts money as a loan
it was a swindle on hisHarkuttsgoodnature He worked himself into
a rage which he felt was innately virtuous at this tyranny of cold
principle over his own warmhearted instincts but if it came to the
LAW hed stand by law and not sentiment Hed just let themby
which he vaguely meant the world Tasajara and possibly his own
consciencesee that he wasnt a sentimental fool and hed freeze on to
that paper and that property

Only he ought to have spoken out before He ought to have told the
surveyor at once that he owned the land He ought to have said Why
thats my land I bought it of that drunken Lige Curtis for a song and
out of charity Yes that was the only real trouble and that came from
his own goodness his own extravagant sense of justice and righthis
own cursed goodnature Yet on second thoughts he didnt know why he
was obliged to tell the surveyor Time enough when the company wanted to
buy the land As soon as it was settled that Lige was dead hed openly
claim the property But what if he wasnt dead or they couldnt find
his body or he had only disappeared His plain matteroffact face
contracted and darkened Of course he couldnt ask the company to
wait for him to settle that point He had the power to dispose of the
property under that paper andhe should do it If Lige turned up
that was another matter and he and Lige could arrange it between them
He was quite firm here and oddly enough quite relieved in getting rid
of what appeared only a simple question of detail He never suspected
that he was contemplating the one irretrievable step and summarily
dismissing the whole ethical question

He turned away from the stove opened the back door and walked with a
more determined step through the passage to the sittingroom But here
he halted again on the threshold with a quick return of his old habits
of caution The door was slightly open apparently his angry outbreak of
an hour ago had not affected the spirits of his daughters for he could
hear their hilarious voices mingling with those of the strangers They
were evidently still fortunetelling but this time it was the prophetic
and divining accents of Mr Rice addressed to Clementina which were now
plainly audible

I see heaps of money and a great many friends in the change that is
coming to you Dear me how many suitors But I cannot promise you any
marriage as brilliant as my friend has just offered your sister You may
be certain however that youll have your own choice in this as you
have in all things

Thank you for nothing said Clementinas voice But what are those
horrid black cards beside themthats trouble Im sure

Not for you though near you Perhaps some one you dont care much for
and dont understand will have a heap of trouble on your accountyes
on account of these very riches see he follows the ten of diamonds It
may be a suitor it may be some one now in the house perhaps

He means himself Miss Clementina struck in Grants voice laughingly

Youre not listening Miss Harkutt said Rice with halfserious
reproach Perhaps you know who it is

But Miss Clementinas reply was simply a hurried recognition of her
fathers pale face that here suddenly confronted her with the opening
door

Why its father




CHAPER III


In his strange mental condition even the change from Harkutts feeble
candle to the outer darkness for a moment blinded Elijah Curtis yet it
was part of that mental condition that he kept moving steadily forward
as in a trance or dream though at first purposelessly Then it occurred
to him that he was really looking for his horse and that the animal was
not there This for a moment confused and frightened him first with the
supposition that he had not brought him at all but that it was part of
his delusion secondly with the conviction that without his horse
he could neither proceed on the course suggested by Harkutt nor take
another more vague one that was dimly in his mind Yet in his hopeless
vacillation it seemed a relief that now neither was practicable and
that he need do nothing Perhaps it was a mysterious providence

The explanation however was much simpler The horse had been taken by
the luxurious and indolent Billings unknown to his companions Overcome
at the dreadful prospect of walking home in that weather this perfect
product of lethargic Sidon had artfully allowed Peters and Wingate to
precede him and cautiously unloosing the tethered animal had safely
passed them in the darkness When he gained his own inclosure he had
lazily dismounted and with a sharp cut on the mustangs haunches
sent him galloping back to rejoin his master with what result has been
already told by the unsuspecting Peters in the preceding chapter

Yet no conception of this possibility entered Lige Curtiss alcoholized
consciousness part of whose morbid phantasy it was to distort or
exaggerate all natural phenomena He had a vague idea that he could not
go back to Harkutts already his visit seemed to have happened long
long ago and could not be repeated He would walk on enwrapped in
this uncompromising darkness which concealed everything suggested
everything and was responsible for everything

It was very dark for the wind having lulled no longer thinned the
veil of clouds above nor dissipated a steaming mist that appeared to
rise from the sodden plain Yet he moved easily through the darkness
seeming to be upheld by it as something tangible upon which he might
lean At times he thought he heard voicesnot a particular voice he
was thinking of but strange voicesof course unreal to his present
fancy And then he heard one of these voices unlike any voice in
Sidon and very faint and far off asking if it was anywhere near
Sidonevidently some one lost like himself He answered in a voice
that seemed quite as unreal and as faint and turned in the direction
from which it came There was a light moving like a willothewisp far
before him yet below him as if coming out of the depths of the earth
It must be fancy but he would seeah

He had fallen violently forward and at the same moment felt his
revolver leap from his breast pocket like a living thing and an instant
after explode upon the rock where it struck blindingly illuminating the
declivity down which he was plunging The sulphurous sting of burning
powder was in his eyes and nose yet in that swift revealing flash he
had time to clutch the stems of a trailing vine beside him but not
to save his head from sharp contact with the same rocky ledge that had
caught his pistol The pain and shock gave way to a sickening sense of
warmth at the roots of his hair Giddy and faint his fingers relaxed
he felt himself sinking with a languor that was half acquiescence
down downuntil with another shock a wild gasping for air and a
swift reaction he awoke in the cold rushing water

Clear and perfectly conscious now though frantically fighting for
existence with the current he could dimly see a floating black object
shooting by the shore at times striking the projections of the bank
until in its recoil it swung half round and drifted broadside on towards
him He was near enough to catch the frayed ends of a trailing rope that
fastened the structure which seemed to be a few logs together With
a convulsive effort he at last gained a footing upon it and then fell
fainting along its length It was the raft which the surveyors from the
embarcadero had just abandoned

He did not know this nor would he have thought it otherwise strange
that a raft might be a part of the drift of the overflow even had he
been entirely conscious but his senses were failing though he was
still able to keep a secure position on the raft and to vaguely believe
that it would carry him to some relief and succor How long he lay
unconscious he never knew in his afterrecollections of that night it
seemed to have been haunted by dreams of passing dim banks and strange
places of a face and voice that had been pleasant to him of a terror
coming upon him as he appeared to be nearing a place like that home that
he had abandoned in the lonely tules He was roused at last by a violent
headache as if his soft felt hat had been changed into a tightening
crown of iron Lifting his hand to his head to tear off its covering
he was surprised to find that he was wearing no hat but that his matted
hair stiffened and dried with blood and ooze was clinging like a cap
to his skull in the hot morning sunlight His eyelids and lashes were
glued together and weighted down by the same sanguinary plaster He
crawled to the edge of his frail raft not without difficulty for it
oscillated and rocked strangely and dipped his hand in the current
When he had cleared his eyes he lifted them with a shock of amazement
Creeks banks and plain had disappeared he was alone on a bend of the
tossing bay of San Francisco

His first and only sensecleared by fasting and quickened by
reactionwas one of infinite relief He was not only free from the
vague terrors of the preceding days and nights but his whole past
seemed to be lost and sunk forever in this illimitable expanse The low
plain of Tasajara with its steadfast monotony of light and shadow
had sunk beneath another level but one that glistened sparkled was
instinct with varying life and moved and even danced below him The low
palisades of regularly recurring tules that had fenced in impeded but
never relieved the blankness of his horizon were forever swallowed
up behind him All trail of past degradation all record of pain and
suffering all footprints of his wandering and misguided feet were
smoothly wiped out in that obliterating sea He was physically helpless
and he felt it he was in danger and he knew itbut he was free

Happily there was but little wind and the sea was slight The raft was
still intact so far as he could judge but even in his ignorance he
knew it would scarcely stand the surges of the lower bay Like most
Californians who had passed the straits of Carquinez at night in a
steamer he did not recognize the locality nor even the distant peak
of Tamalpais There were a few dotting sails that seemed as remote
as uncertain and as unfriendly as sea birds The raft was motionless
almost as motionless as he was in his cramped limbs and sundried
stiffened clothes Too weak to keep an upright position without mast
stick or oar to lift a signal above that vast expanse it seemed
impossible for him to attract attention Even his pistol was gone

Suddenly in an attempt to raise himself he was struck by a flash so
blinding that it seemed to pierce his aching eyes and brain and turned
him sick It appeared to come from a crevice between the logs at the
further end of the raft Creeping painfully towards it he saw that it
was a triangular slip of highly polished metal that he had hitherto
overlooked He did not know that it was a flashing mirror used
in topographical observation which had slipped from the surveyors
instruments when they abandoned the raft but his excited faculties
instinctively detected its value to him He lifted it and facing the
sun raised it at different angles with his feeble arms But the effort
was too much for him the raft presently seemed to be whirling with his
movement and he again fell



Ahoy there

The voice was close uponin his very ears He opened his eyes The sea
still stretched emptily before him the dotting sails still unchanged
and distant Yet a strange shadow lay upon the raft He turned his head
with difficulty On the opposite sideso close upon him as to be almost
over his headthe great white sails of a schooner hovered above him
like the wings of some enormous sea bird Then a heavy boom swung across
the raft so low that it would have swept him away had he been in an
upright position the sides of the vessel grazed the raft and she fell
slowly off A terrible fear of abandonment took possession of him he
tried to speak but could not The vessel moved further away but the
raft followed He could see now it was being held by a boathookcould
see the odd eager curiosity on two faces that were raised above
the taffrail and with that sense of relief his eyes again closed in
unconsciousness

A feeling of chilliness followed by a grateful sensation of drawing
closer under some warm covering a stinging taste in his mouth of fiery
liquor and the aromatic steam of hot coffee were his first returning
sensations His head and neck were swathed in coarse bandages and his
skin stiffened and smarting with soap He was lying in a rude berth
under a halfdeck from which he could see the sky and the bellying sail
and presently a bearded face filled with rough and practical concern
that peered down upon him

Hulloo comin round eh Hold on The next moment the stranger had
leaped down beside Elijah He seemed to be an odd mingling of the sailor
and ranchero with the shrewdness of a seaport trader

Hulloo boss What was it A free fight or a washout

A washout Elijah grasped the idea as an inspiration Yes his cabin
had been inundated he had taken to a raft had been knocked off twice
or thrice and had lost everythingeven his revolver

  A mining term for the temporary inundation of a claim by
 flood also used for the sterilizing effect of flood on
 fertile soil

The man looked relieved Then it aint a free fight nor havin your
crust busted and bein robbed by beach combers eh

No said Elijah with his first faint smile

Glad o that said the man bluntly Then thar aint no police
business to tie up to in Frisco We were stuck thar a week once just
because we chanced to pick up a feller whod been found gagged and then
thrown overboard by wharf thieves Had to dance attendance at court
thar and lost our trip He stopped and looked halfpathetically at the
prostrate Elijah Look yer ye aint just dyin to go ashore NOW and
see yer friends and send messages are ye

Elijah shuddered inwardly but outwardly smiled faintly as he replied
No

And the tide and wind jest servin us now ye wouldnt mind keepin
straight on with us this trip

Where to asked Elijah

Santy Barbara

No said Elijah after a moments pause Ill go with you

The man leaped to his feet lifted his head above the upper deck
shouted Let her go free Jerry and then turned gratefully to his
passenger Look yer A washout is a washout I reckon put it any
way you like it dont put anything back into the land or anything back
into your pocket afterwards eh No And yer well out of it pardner
Now theres a right smart chance for locatin jest back of Santy
Barbara where thar aint no Godforsaken tules to overflow and ez far
ez the land and licker lies ye neednt take any water in yours ef ye
dont want it You kin start fresh thar pardner and brail up Whats
the matter with you old man is only fever n agur ketched in them
tules I kin see it in your eyes Now you hold on whar you be till I go
forrard and see everything taut and then Ill come back and well have
a talk

And they did The result of which was that at the end of a weeks
tossing and seasickness Elijah Curtis was landed at Santa Barbara
pale thin but selfcontained and resolute And having found favor
in the eyes of the skipper of the Kitty Hawk general trader
lumberdealer and ranchman a week later he was located on the
skippers land and installed in the skippers service And from that
day for five years Sidon and Tasajara knew him no more




CHAPER IV


It was part of the functions of John Milton Harkutt to take down the
early morning shutters and sweep out the store for his father each day
before going to school It was a peculiarity of this performance that he
was apt to linger over it partly from the fact that it put off the
evil hour of lessons partly that he imparted into the process a purely
imaginative and romantic element gathered from his latest novelreading
In this he was usually assisted by one or two schoolfellows on their
way to school who always envied him his superior menial occupation To
go to school it was felt was a common calamity of boyhood that called
into play only the simplest forms of evasion whereas to take down
actual shutters in a bona fide store and wield a real broom that raised
a palpable cloud of dust was something that really taxed the noblest
exertions And it was the morning after the arrival of the strangers
that John Milton stood on the veranda of the store ostentatiously
examining the horizon with his hand shading his eyes as one of his
companions appeared

Hollo Milt wot yer doin

John Milton started dramatically and then violently dashed at one of
the shutters and began to detach it Ha he said hoarsely Clear the
ship for action Open the ports On deck there Steady you lubbers
In an instant his enthusiastic schoolfellow was at his side attacking
another shutter A long low schooner bearing down upon us Lively
lads lively continued John Milton desisting a moment to take another
dramatic look at the distant plain How does she head now he demanded
fiercely

Sou by soueast sir responded the other boy frantically dancing
before the window But shell weather it

They each then wrested another shutter away violently depositing them
as they ran to and fro in a rack at the corner of the veranda Added
to an extraordinary and unnecessary clattering with their feet they
accompanied their movements with a singular hissing sound supposed to
indicate in one breath the fury of the elements the bustle of the eager
crew and the wild excitement of the coming conflict When the last
shutter was cleared away John Milton with the cry Man the starboard
guns dashed into the store whose floor was marked by the muddy
footprints of yesterdays buyers seized a broom and began to sweep
violently A cloud of dust arose into which his companion at once
precipitated himself with another broom and a loud BANG to indicate the
somewhat belated sound of cannon For a few seconds the two boys plied
their brooms desperately in that stifling atmosphere accompanying each
long sweep and puff of dust out of the open door with the report of
explosions and loud HAS of defiance until not only the store but the
veranda was obscured with a cloud which the morning sun struggled vainly
to pierce In the midst of this tumult and dusty confusionhappily
unheard and unsuspected in the secluded domestic interior of the
buildinga shrill little voice arose from the road

Think youre mighty smart dont ye

The two naval heroes stopped in their imaginary fury and as the dust
of conflict cleared away recognized little Johnny Peters gazing at them
with mingled inquisitiveness and envy

Guess ye dont know what happened down the run last night he
continued impatiently Lige Curtis got killed or killed hisself
Blood all over the rock down thar Seed it myseff Dad picked up his
sixshooterone barrel gone off My dad was the first to find it out
and hes bin to Squire Kerby tellin him

The two companions albeit burning with curiosity affected indifference
and preknowledge

Dad sez your father druv Lige outer the store lass night Dad sez your
fathers sponsible Dad sez your father ez good ez killed him Dad sez
the squirell set the constable on your father Yah But here the small
insulter incontinently fled pursued by both the boys Nevertheless
when he had made good his escape John Milton showed neither a
disposition to take up his former nautical role nor to follow his
companion to visit the sanguinary scene of Elijahs disappearance He
walked slowly back to the store and continued his work of sweeping and
putting in order with an abstracted regularity and no trace of his
former exuberant spirits

The first one of those instinctive fears which are common to imaginative
children and often assume the functions of premonition had taken
possession of him The oddity of his fathers manner the evening before
which had only half consciously made its indelible impression on his
sensitive fancy had recurred to him with Johnny Peterss speech He had
no idea of literally accepting the boys charges he scarcely understood
their gravity but he had a miserable feeling that his fathers anger
and excitement last night was because he had been discovered hunting in
the dark for that paper of Lige Curtiss It WAS Lige Curtiss paper
for he had seen it lying there A sudden dreadful conviction came over
him that he must never never let any one know that he had seen his
father take up that paper that he must never admit it even to HIM It
was not the boys first knowledge of that attitude of hypocrisy which
the grownup world assumes towards childhood and in which the innocent
victims eventually acquiesce with a Machiavellian subtlety that at last
avenges thembut it was his first knowledge that that hypocrisy might
not be so innocent His father had concealed something from him because
it was not right

But if childhood does not forget it seldom broods and is not above
being diverted And the two surveyorsof whose heroic advent in a raft
John Milton had only heard that morning with their traveled ways their
strange instruments and stranger talk captured his fancy Kept in
the background by his sisters when visitors came as an unpresentable
feature in the household he however managed to linger near the
strangers when in company with Euphemia and Clementina after breakfast
they strolled beneath the sparkling sunlight in the rude garden
inclosure along the sloping banks of the creek It was with the average
brothers supreme contempt that he listened to his sisters practicin
upon the goodness of these superior beings it was with an exceptional
pity that he regarded the evident admiration of the strangers in return
He felt that in the case of Euphemia who sometimes evinced a laudable
curiosity in his pleasures and a flattering ignorance of his reading
this might be pardonable but what any one could find in the useless
statuesque Clementina passed his comprehension Could they not see at
once that she was just that kind of person who would lie abed in
the morning pretending she was sick in order to make Phemie do the
housework and make him John Milton clean her boots and fetch things
for her Was it not perfectly plain to them that her present sickening
politeness was solely with a view to extract from them caramels
rockcandy and gum drops which she would meanly keep herself and
perhaps some buggyriding later Alas John Milton it was not For
standing there with her tall perfectlyproportioned figure outlined
against a willow an elastic branch of which she had drawn down by one
curved arm above her head and on which she leanedas everybody leaned
against something in Sidonthe two young men saw only a straying
goddess in a glorified rosebud print Whether the clearlycut profile
presented to Rice or the full face that captivated Grant each
suggested possibilities of position pride poetry and passion that
astonished while it fascinated them By one of those instincts known
only to the freemasonry of the sex Euphemia lent herself to this
advertisement of her sisters charms by subtle comparison with her own
prettinesses and thus combined against their common enemy man

Clementina certainly is perfect to keep her supremacy over that pretty
little sister thought Rice

What a fascinating little creature to hold her own against that tall
handsome girl thought Grant

Theyre takin stock o them two fellers so as to gabble about em when
their backs is turned said John Milton gloomily to himself with a
dismal premonition of the prolonged teatable gossip he would be obliged
to listen to later

We were very fortunate to make a landing at all last night said Rice
looking down upon the still swollen current and then raising his eyes
to Clementina Still more fortunate to make it where we did I suppose
it must have been the singing that lured us on to the bankas
you know the sirens used to lure peopleonly with less disastrous
consequences

John Milton here detected three glaring errors first it was NOT
Clementina who had sung secondly he knew that neither of his sisters
had ever read anything about sirens but he had thirdly that the
young surveyor was glaringly ignorant of local phenomena and should be
corrected

Its nothin but the current he said with that feverish youthful
haste that betrays a fatal experience of impending interruption Its
always leavin drift and rubbish from everywhere here There aint
anythin thats chucked into the creek above that aint bound to fetch
up on this bank Why there was two sheep and a dead hoss here long
afore YOU thought of coming He did not understand why this should
provoke the laughter that it did and to prove that he had no ulterior
meaning added with pointed politeness So IT ISNT YOUR FAULT you
knowYOU couldnt help it supplementing this with the distinct
courtesy otherwise you wouldnt have come

But it would seem that your visitors are not all as accidental as your
brother would imply and one at least seems to have been expected last
evening You remember you thought we were a Mr Parmlee said Mr Rice
looking at Clementina

It would be strange indeed he thought if the beautiful girl were not
surrounded by admirers But without a trace of selfconsciousness or
any change in her reposeful face she indicated her sister with a slight
gesture and said One of Phemies friends He gave her the accordion
Shes very popular

And I suppose YOU are very hard to please he said with a tentative
smile

She looked at him with her large clear eyes and that absence of
coquetry or changed expression in her beautiful face which might have
stood for indifference or dignity as she said I dont know I am
waiting to see

But here Miss Phemie broke in saucily with the assertion that Mr
Parmlee might not have a railroad in his pocket but that at least he
didnt have to wait for the Flood to call on young ladies nor did he
usually come in pairs for all the world as if he had been let out of
Noahs Ark but on horseback and like a Christian by the front door
All this provokingly and bewitchingly delivered however and with a
simulated exaggeration that was incited apparently more by Mr Lawrence
Grants evident enjoyment of it than by any desire to defend the absent
Parmlee

But where is the front door asked Grant laughingly

The young girl pointed to a narrow zigzag path that ran up the bank
beside the house until it stopped at a small picketed gate on the level
of the road and store

But I should think it would be easier to have a door and private
passage through the store said Grant

WE dont said the young lady pertly we have nothing to do with the
store I go in to see paw sometimes when hes shutting up and theres
nobody there but Clem has never set foot in it since we came Its bad
enough to have it and the lazy loafers that hang around it as near to
us as they are but paw built the house in such a fashion that we aint
troubled by their noise and we might be tother side of the creek as
far as our having to come across them And because paw has to sell pork
and flour we havent any call to go there and watch him do it

The two men glanced at each other This reserve and fastidiousness were
something rare in a pioneer community Harkutts manners certainly did
not indicate that he was troubled by this sensitiveness it must have
been some individual temperament of his daughters Stephen felt his
respect increase for the goddesslike Clementina Mr Lawrence Grant
looked at Miss Phemie with a critical smile

But you must be very limited in your company he said or is Mr
Parmlee not a customer of your fathers

As Mr Parmlee does not come to us through the store and dont talk
trade to me we dont know responded Phemie saucily

But have you no lady acquaintancesneighborswho also avoid the store
and enter only at the straight and narrow gate up there continued
Grant mischievously regardless of the uneasy halfreproachful glances
of Rice

But Phemie triumphantly oblivious of any satire answered promptly
If you mean the Pike County Billingses who live on the turnpike road as
much as they do off it or the six daughters of that Georgia Cracker who
wear mens boots and hats we havent

And Mr Parmlee your admirer suggested Rice Hasnt he a mother or
sisters here

Yes but they dont want to know us and have never called here

The embarrassment of the questioner at this unexpected reply which came
from the faultless lips of Clementina was somewhat mitigated by the
fact that the young womans voice and manner betrayed neither annoyance
nor anger

Here however Harkutt appeared from the house with the information that
he had secured two horses for the surveyors and their instruments and
that he would himself accompany them a part of the way on their
return to Tasajara Creek to show them the road His usual listless
deliberation had given way to a certain nervous but uneasy energy If
they started at once it would be better before the loungers gathered at
the store and confused them with lazy counsel and languid curiosity He
took it for granted that Mr Grant wished the railroad survey to be
a secret and he had said nothing as they would be pestered with
questions Sidon was inquisitiveand oldfashioned The benefit its
inhabitants would get from the railroad would not prevent them from
throwing obstacles in its way at first he remembered the way they
had acted with a proposed wagon roadin fact an idea of his own
something like the railroad he knew them thoroughly and if he might
advise them it would be to say nothing here until the thing was
settled

He evidently does not intend to give us a chance said Grant
goodhumoredly to his companion as they turned to prepare for their
journey we are to be conducted in silence to the outskirts of the town
like horsethieves

But you gave him the tip for himself said Rice reproachfully you
cannot blame him for wanting to keep it

I gave it to him in trust for his two incredible daughters said Grant
with a grimace But hang it if I dont believe the fellow has more
concern in it than I imagined

But isnt she perfect said Rice with charming abstraction

Who

Clementina and so unlike her father

Discomposingly so said Grant quietly One feels in calling her Miss
Harkutt as if one were touching upon a manifest indiscretion But here
comes John Milton Well my lad what can I do for you

The boy who had been regarding them from a distance with wistful and
curious eyes as they replaced their instruments for the journey had
gradually approached them After a moments timid hesitation he said
looking at Grant You dont know anybody in this kind o business
pointing to the instruments whod like a boy about my size

Im afraid not J M said Grant cheerfully without suspending his
operation The fact is you see its not exactly the kind of work for
a boy of your size

John Milton was silent for a moment shifting himself slowly from one
leg to another as he watched the surveyor After a pause he said There
dont seem to be much show in this world for boys o my size There
dont seem to be much use for em any way This not bitterly but
philosophically and even politely as if to relieve Grants rejection
of any incivility

Really you quite pain me John Milton said Grant looking up as he
tightened a buckle I never thought of it before but youre right

Now continued the boy slowly with girls its just different Girls
of my size everybody does things for Theres Clemmyshes only two
years older nor me and dont know half that I do and yet she kin lie
about all day and hasnt to get up to breakfast And Phemiewhos
jest the same age size and weight as memaw and paw lets her do
everything she wants to And so does everybody And so would you

But you surely dont want to be like a girl said Grant smiling

It here occurred to John Miltons youthful but not illogical mind that
this was not argument and he turned disappointedly away As his father
was to accompany the strangers a short distance he John Milton was
today left in charge of the store That duty however did not involve
any pecuniary transactionsthe taking of money or making of change but
a simple record on a slate behind the counter of articles selected by
those customers whose urgent needs could not wait Mr Harkutts return
Perhaps on account of this degrading limitation perhaps for other
reasons the boy did not fancy the task imposed upon him The presence
of the idle loungers who usually occupied the armchairs near the stove
and occasionally the counter dissipated any romance with which he
might have invested his charge he wearied of the monotony of their dull
gossip but mostly he loathed the attitude of hypercritical counsel and
instruction which they saw fit to assume towards him at such moments
Instead o lazin thar behind the counter when your father aint here
to see ye John remarked Billings from the depths of his armchair a
few moments after Harkutt had ridden away ye orter be bustlin round
dustin the shelves Yell never come to anythin when youre a man ef
you go on like that Ye never heard o Harry Claythat was called the
Millboy of the Slashessittin down doin nothin when he was a boy

I never heard of him loafin round in a grocery store when he was
growned up either responded John Milton darkly

Praps you reckon he got to be a great man by standin up sassin his
fathers customers said Peters angrily I kin tell ye young man if
you was my boy

If I was YOUR boy Id be playin hookey instead of goin to school
jest as your boy is doin now interrupted John Milton with a literal
recollection of his quarrel and pursuit of the youth in question that
morning

An undignified silence on the part of the adults followed the usual
sequel to those passages Sidon generally declining to expose itself to
the youthful Harkutts terrible accuracy of statement

The men resumed their previous lazy gossip about Elijah Curtiss
disappearance with occasional mysterious allusions in a lower tone
which the boy instinctively knew referred to his father but which
either from indolence or caution the two great conservators of Sidon
were never formulated distinctly enough for his relentless interference
The morning sunshine was slowly thickening again in an indolent mist
that seemed to rise from the saturated plain A stray lounger shuffled
over from the blacksmiths shop to the store to take the place of
another idler who had joined an equally lethargic circle around
the slumbering forge A dull intermittent sound of hammering came
occasionally from the wheelwrights shedat sufficiently protracted
intervals to indicate the enfeebled progress of Sidons vehicular
repair A yellow dog left his patch of sunlight on the opposite side
of the way and walked deliberately over to what appeared to be more
luxurious quarters on the veranda was manifestly disappointed but not
equal to the exertion of returning and sank down with blinking eyes and
a regretful sigh without going further A procession of six ducks got
well into a line for a laborious march past the store but fell out
at the first mud puddle and gave it up A highly nervous but respectable
hen who had ventured upon the veranda evidently against her better
instincts walked painfully on tiptoe to the door apparently was met
by language which no mother of a family could listen to and retired in
strong hysterics A little later the sun became again obscured the
wind arose rain fell and the opportunity for going indoors and doing
nothing was once more availed of by all Sidon

It was afternoon when Mr Harkutt returned He did not go into the
store but entered the dwelling from the little picketgate and steep
path There he called a family council in the sittingroom as being
the most reserved and secure Mrs Harkutt sympathizing and cheerfully
ready for any affliction still holding a dustcloth in her hand took
her seat by the window with Phemie breathless and sparkling at one side
of her while Clementina all faultless profile and repose sat on the
other To Mrs Harkutts motherly concern at John Miltons absence it
was pointed out that he was wanted at the storewas a mere boy anyhow
and could not be trusted Mr Harkutt a little ruddier from weather
excitement and the unusual fortification of a glass of liquor a little
more rugged in the lines of his face and with an odd ring of defiant
selfassertion in his voice stood before them in the centre of the
room

He wanted them to listen to him carefully to remember what he said for
it was important it might be a matter of lawing hereafterand he
couldnt be always repeating it to themhe would have enough to do
There was a heap of it that as womenfolks they couldnt understand
and werent expected to But hed got it all clear now and what he was
saying was gospel Hed always known to himself that the only good that
could ever come to Sidon would come by railroad When those fools talked
wagon road he had said nothing but he had his own ideas he had worked
for that idea without saying anything to anybody that idea was to get
possession of all the land along the embarcadero which nobody
cared for and Lige Curtis was ready to sell for a song Well now
considering what had happened he didnt mind telling them that he had
been gradually getting possession of it little by little paying Lige
Curtis in advances and installments until it was his own They had
heard what those surveyors said how that it was the only fit terminus
for the railroad Well that land and that waterfront and the
terminus were HIS And all from his own foresight and prudence

It is needless to say that this was not the truth But it is necessary
to point out that this fabrication was the result of his last nights
cogitations and his mornings experience He had resolved upon a bold
course He had reflected that his neighbors would be more ready to
believe in and to respect a hard mercenary and speculative foresight
in his taking advantage of Liges necessities than if he hadas was
the casemerely benefited by them through an accident of circumstance
and good humor In the latter case he would be envied and hated in
the former he would be envied and feared By logic of circumstance
the greater wrong seemed to be less obviously offensive than the minor
fault It was true that it involved the doing of something he had not
contemplated and the certainty of exposure if Lige ever returned
but he was nevertheless resolved The step from passive to active
wrongdoing is not only easy it is often a relief it is that return to
sincerity which we all require Howbeit it gave that ring of assertion
to Daniel Harkutts voice already noted which most women like and
only men are prone to suspect or challenge The incompleteness of his
statement was for the same reason overlooked by his feminine auditors

And what is it worth dad asked Phemie eagerly

Grant says I oughter get at least ten thousand dollars for the site of
the terminus from the company but of course I shall hold on to the rest
of the land The moment they get the terminus there and the depot and
wharf built I can get my own price and buyers for the rest Before the
year is out Grant thinks it ought to go up ten per cent on the value of
the terminus and that a hundred thousand

Oh dad gasped Phemie frantically clasping her knees with both hands
as if to perfectly assure herself of this good fortune

Mrs Harkutt audibly murmured Poor dear Danl and stood as it were
sympathetically by ready to commiserate the pains and anxieties of
wealth as she had those of poverty Clementina alone remained silent
cleareyed and unchanged

And to think it all came through THEM continued Phemie I always had
an idea that Mr Grant was smart dad And it was real kind of him to
tell you

I reckon father could have found it out without them I dont know why
we should be beholden to them particularly I hope he isnt expected to
let them think that he is bound to consider them our intimate friends
just because they happened to drop in here at a time when his plans have
succeeded

The voice was Clementinas unexpected but quiet unemotional and
convincing It seemed as Mrs Harkutt afterwards said as if the
child had already touched that hundred thousand Phemie reddened with a
sense of convicted youthful extravagance

You neednt fear for me said Harkutt responding to Clementinas
voice as if it were an echo of his own and instinctively recognizing
an unexpected ally Ive got my own ideas of this thing and whats
to come of it Ive got my own ideas of openin up that property and
showin its resources Im goin to run it my own way Im goin to have
a town along the embarcadero thatll lay over any town in Contra Costa
Im goin to have the courthouse and county seat there and a couple
of hotels as good as any in the Bay Im goin to build that wagon road
through here that those lazy louts slipped up on and carry it clear
over to Five Mile Corner and open up the whole Tasajara Plain

They had never seen him look so strong so resolute so intelligent and
handsome A dimly prophetic vision of him in a black broadcloth suit and
gold watchchain addressing a vague multitude as she remembered to
have seen the Hon Stanley Riggs of Alasco at the Great Barbecue
rose before Phemies blue enraptured eyes With the exception of Mrs
Harkuttequal to any possibilities on the part of her husbandthey
had honestly never expected it of him They were pleased with their
fathers attitude in prosperity and felt that perhaps he was not
unworthy of being proud of them hereafter

But were goin to leave Sidon said Phemie aint we paw

As soon as I can run up a new house at the embarcadero said Harkutt
peevishly and thats got to be done mighty quick if I want to make a
show to the company and be in possession

And thats easier for you to do dear now that Liges disappeared
said Mrs Harkutt consolingly

What do ye mean by that What the devil are ye talkin about demanded
Harkutt suddenly with unexpected exasperation

I mean that that drunken Lige would be mighty poor company for the
girls if he was our only neighbor returned Mrs Harkutt submissively

Harkutt after a fixed survey of his wife appeared mollified The two
girls who were mindful of his previous outburst the evening before
exchanged glances which implied that his manners needed correction for
prosperity

Youll want a heap o money to build there Danl said Mrs Harkutt
in plaintive diffidence

Yes Yes said Harkutt impatiently Ive kalkilated all that and
Im goin to Frisco tomorrow to raise it and put this bill of sale on
record He half drew Elijah Curtiss paper from his pocket but paused
and put it back again

Then THAT WAS the paper dad said Phemie triumphantly

Yes said her father regarding her fixedly and you know now why I
didnt want anything said about it last nightnor even now

And Lige had just given it to you Wasnt it lucky

He HADNT just given it to me said her father with another unexpected
outburst God Amighty aint I tellin you all the time it was an old
matter But you jabber jabber all the time and dont listen Wheres
John Milton It had occurred to him that the boy might have read the
paperas his sister hadwhile it lay unheeded on the counter

In the storeyou know You said he wasnt to hear anything of this
but Ill call him said Mrs Harkutt rising eagerly

Never mind returned her husband stopping her reflectively best
leave it as it is if its necessary Ill tell him But dont any of you
say anything do you hear

Nevertheless a few hours later when the store was momentarily free of
loungers and Harkutt had relieved his son of his monotonous charge he
made a pretense while abstractedly listening to an account of the boys
stewardship to look through a drawer as if in search of some missing
article

You didnt see anything of a paper I left somewhere about here
yesterday he asked carelessly

The one you picked up when you came in last night said the boy with
discomposing directness

Harkutt flushed slightly and drew his breath between his set teeth Not
only could he place no reliance upon ordinary youthful inattention
but he must be on his guard against his own son as from a spy But he
restrained himself

I dont remember he said with affected deliberation what it was I
picked up Do you Did you read it

The meaning of his fathers attitude instinctively flashed upon the boy
He HAD read the paper but he answered as he had already determined
No

An inspiration seized Mr Harkutt He drew Lige Curtiss bill of sale
from his pocket and opening it before John Milton said Was it that

I dont know said the boy I couldnt tell He walked away with
affected carelessness already with a sense of playing some part like
his father and pretended to whistle for the dog across the street
Harkutt coughed ostentatiously put the paper back in his pocket
set one or two boxes straight on the counter locked the drawer and
disappeared into the back passage John Milton remained standing in
the doorway looking vacantly out But he did not see the dull familiar
prospect beyond He only saw the paper his father had opened and
unfolded before him It was the same paper he had read last night But
there were three words written there THAT WERE NOT THERE BEFORE After
the words Value received there had been a blank He remembered that
distinctly This was filled in by the words Five hundred dollars The
handwriting did not seem like his fathers nor yet entirely like Lige
Curtiss What it meant he did not knowhe would not try to think He
should forget it as he had tried to forget what had happened before
and he should never tell it to any one

There was a feverish gayety in his sisters manner that afternoon that
he did not understand short colloquies that were suspended with ill
concealed impatience when he came near them and resumed when he
was sent on equally palpable excuses out of the room He had been
accustomed to this exclusion when there were strangers present but it
seemed odd to him now when the conversation did not even turn upon the
two superior visitors who had been there and of whom he confidently
expected they would talk Such fragments as he overheard were always in
the future tense and referred to what they intended to do His
mother whose affection for him had always been shown in excessive
and depressing commiseration of him in even his lightest moments that
afternoon seemed to add a prophetic and Cassandralike sympathy for some
vague future of his that would require all her ministration You wont
need them new boots Milty dear in the changes that may be comin to
ye so dont be bothering your poor father in his worriments over his
new plans

What new plans mommer asked the boy abruptly Are we goin away
from here

Hush dear and dont ask questions thats enough for grown folks to
worry over let alone a boy like you Now be gooda quality in Mrs
Harkutts mind synonymous with ceasing from troublingand after
supper while Im in the parlor with your father and sisters you kin
sit up here by the fire with your book

But persisted the boy in a flash of inspiration is popper goin to
join in business with those surveyorsa surveyin

No child what an idea Run away thereand minddont bother your
father

Nevertheless John Miltons inspiration had taken a new and
characteristic shape All this he reflected had happened since the
surveyors camesince they had weakly displayed such a shameless and
unmanly interest in his sisters It could have but one meaning He hung
around the sittingroom and passages until he eventually encountered
Clementina taller than ever evidently wearing a guilty satisfaction
in her face engrafted upon that habitual bearing of hers which he had
always recognized as belonging to a vague but objectionable race whose
members were individually known to him as a proudy

Which of those two surveyor fellows is it Clemmy he said with an
engaging smile yet halting at a strategic distance

Is what

Wot youre goin to marry

Idiot

That aint tellin which responded the boy darkly

Clementina swept by him into the sittingroom where he heard her
declare that really that boy was getting too low and vulgar
for anything Yet it struck him that being pressed for further
explanation she did NOT specify why This was girls meanness

Howbeit he lingered late in the road that evening hearing his father
discuss with the searchparty that had followed the banks of the creek
vainly looking for further traces of the missing Lige the possibility
of his being living or dead of the body having been carried away by the
current to the bay or turning up later in some distant marsh when the
spring came with low water One who had been to his cabin beside the
embarcadero reported that it was as had been long suspected barely
habitable and contained neither books papers nor records which would
indicate his family or friends It was a Godforsaken dreary worthless
place he wondered how a white man could ever expect to make a living
there If Elijah never turned up again it certainly would be a long time
before any squatter would think of taking possession of it John Milton
knew instinctively without looking up that his fathers eyes were
fixed upon him and he felt himself constrained to appear to be
abstracted in gazing down the darkening road Then he heard his father
say with what he felt was an equal assumption of carelessness Yes I
reckon Ive got somewhere a bill of sale of that land that I had to take
from Lige for an old bill but I kalkilate thats all Ill ever see of
it

Rain fell again as the darkness gathered but he still loitered on the
road and the sloping path of the garden filled with a half resentful
sense of wrong and hugging with gloomy pride an increasing sense of
loneliness and of getting dangerously wet The swollen creek still
whispered murmured and swirled beside the bank At another time he
might have had wild ideas of emulating the surveyors on some extempore
raft and so escaping his present dreary home existence but since the
disappearance of Lige who had always excited an odd boyish antipathy
in his heart although he had never seen him he shunned the stream
contaminated with the missing mans unheroic fate Presently the light
from the open window of the sittingroom glittered on the wet leaves
and sprays where he stood and the voices of the family conclave came
fitfully to his ear They didnt want him there They had never thought
of asking him to come in Wellwho cared And he wasnt going to be
bought off with a candle and a seat by the kitchen fire No

Nevertheless he was getting wet to no purpose There was the toolhouse
and carpenters shed near the bank its floor was thickly covered with
sawdust and pinewood shavings and there was a mouldy buffalo skin
which he had once transported thither from the old wagonbed There
too was his secret cache of a candle in a bottle buried with other
piratical treasures in the presence of the youthful Peters who
consented to be sacrificed on the spot in buccaneering fashion to
complete the unhallowed rites He unearthed the candle lit it and
clearing away a part of the shavings stood it up on the floor He then
brought a prized battered and coverless volume from a hidden recess in
the rafters and lying down with the buffalo robe over him and his cap
in his hand ready to extinguish the light at the first footstep of a
trespasser gave himself upas he had given himself up I fear many
other timesto the enchantment of the page before him

The current whispered murmured and sang unheeded at his side The
voices of his mother and sisters raised at times in eagerness or
expectation of the future fell upon his unlistening ears For with the
spell that had come upon him the mean walls of his hidingplace
melted away the vulgar stream beside him might have been that dim
subterraneous river down which Sindbad and his bale of riches were swept
out of the Cave of Death to the sunlight of life and fortune so surely
and so simply had it transported him beyond the cramped and darkened
limits of his present life He was in the better world of boyish
romanceof gallant deeds and high emprises of miraculous atonement
and devoted sacrifice of brave men and those rarer impossible
womenthe immaculate conception of a boys virgin heart What mattered
it that behind that glittering window his mother and sisters grew
feverish and excited over the vulgar details of their real but baser
fortune From the dark toolshed by the muddy current John Milton
with a battered dogseared chronicle soared on the wings of fancy far
beyond their wildest ken




CHAPER V


Prosperity had settled upon the plains of Tasajara Not only had the
embarcadero emerged from the tules of Tasajara Creek as a thriving town
of steamboat wharves warehouses and outlying mills and factories but
in five years the transforming railroad had penetrated the great plain
itself and revealed its undeveloped fertility The lowlying lands that
had been yearly overflowed by the creek now drained and cultivated
yielded treasures of wheat and barley that were apparently
inexhaustible Even the helpless indolence of Sidon had been surprised
into activity and change There was nothing left of the straggling
settlement to recall its former aspect The site of Harkutts old store
and dwelling was lost and forgotten in the new mill and granary that
rose along the banks of the creek Decay leaves ruin and traces for the
memory to linger over prosperity is unrelenting in its complete and
smiling obliteration of the past

But Tasajara City as the embarcadero was now called had no previous
record and even the former existence of an actual settler like the
forgotten Elijah Curtis was unknown to the present inhabitants It was
Daniel Harkutts idea carried out in Daniel Harkutts land with Daniel
Harkutts capital and energy But Daniel Harkutt had become Daniel
Harcourt and Harcourt Avenue Harcourt Square and Harcourt House
ostentatiously proclaimed the new spelling of his patronymic When the
change was made and for what reason who suggested it and under what
authority were not easy to determine as the sign on his former store
had borne nothing but the legend Goods and Provisions and his name did
not appear on written record until after the occupation of Tasajara
but it is presumed that it was at the instigation of his daughters and
there was no one to oppose it Harcourt was a pretty name for a street
a square or a hotel even the few in Sidon who had called it Harkutt
admitted that it was an improvement quite consistent with the change
from the feverhaunted tules and sedges of the creek to the broad
level and handsome squares of Tasajara City

This might have been the opinion of a visitor at the Harcourt House who
arrived one summer afternoon from the Stockton boat but whose shrewd
halfcritical halfprofessional eyes and quiet questionings betrayed
some previous knowledge of the locality Seated on the broad veranda
of the Harcourt House and gazing out on the wellkept green and young
eucalyptus trees of the Harcourt Square or Plaza he had elicited a
counter question from a prosperouslooking citizen who had been lounging
at his side

I reckon you look ez if you might have been here before stranger

Yes said the stranger quietly I have been But it was when the
tules grew in the square opposite and the tide of the creek washed
them

Well said the Tasajaran looking curiously at the stranger I call
myself a pioneer of Tasajara My names Petersof Peters and Coand
those warehouses along the wharf where you landed just now are mine
but I was the first settler on Harcourts land and built the next cabin
after him I helped to clear out them tules and dredged the channels
yonder I took the contract with Harcourt to build the last fifteen
miles o railroad and put up that depot for the company Perhaps you
were here before that

I was returned the stranger quietly

I say said Peters hitching his chair a little nearer to his
companion you never knew a kind of brokendown feller called
CurtisLige Curtiswho once squatted here and sold his right to
Harkutt He disappeared it was allowed he killed hisself but they
never found his body and between you and me I never took stock in
that story You know Harcourt holds under him and all Tasajara rests on
that title

Ive heard so assented the stranger carelessly but I never knew the
original settler Then Harcourt has been lucky

You bet Hes got three millions right about HERE or within this
quarter section to say nothing of his outside speculations

And lives here

Not for two years Thats his old house across the plaza but his
womenfolks live mostly in Frisco and New York where hes got houses
too They say they sorter got sick of Tasajara after his youngest
daughter ran off with a feller

Hallo said the stranger with undisguised interest I never heard of
that You dont mean that she elopedhe hesitated

Oh it was a square enough marriage I reckon too square to suit some
folks but the fellow hadnt nothin and wasnt worth shucksa sort
of land surveyor doin odd jobs you know and the old man and old
woman were agin it and the tother daughter worse of all It was allowed
hereyou know how womenfolks talkthat the surveyor had been sweet
on Clementina but had got tired of being played by her and took up
with Phemie out o spite Anyhow they got married and Harcourt gave
them to understand they couldnt expect anything from him Praps thats
why it didnt last long for only about two months ago she got a divorce
from Rice and came back to her family again

Rice queried the stranger Was that her husbands name Stephen
Rice

I reckon You knew him

Yeswhen the tide came up to the tules yonder answered the
stranger musingly And the other daughterI suppose she has made a
good match being a beauty and the sole heiress

The Tasajaran made a grimace Not much I reckon shes waitin for the
Angel Gabrielthere aint another good enough to suit her here They
say shes had most of the big men in California waitin in a line with
their offers like that cue the fellows used to make at the Frisco
postoffice steamer daysand she with nary a letter or answer for any
of them

Then Harcourt doesnt seem to have been as fortunate in his family
affairs as in his speculations

Peters uttered a grim laugh Well I reckon you know all about his
sons stampeding with that girl last spring

His son interrupted the stranger Do you mean the boy they called
John Milton Why he was a mere child

He was old enough to run away with a young woman that helped in his
mothers house and marry her afore a justice of the peace The old man
just snorted with rage and swore hed have the marriage put aside for
the boy was under age He said it was a putup job of the girls that
she was older by two years and only wanted to get what money might be
comin some day but that theyd never see a red cent of it Then they
say John Milton up and sassed the old man to his face and allowed that
he wouldnt take his dirty money if he starved first and that if the
old man broke the marriage hed marry her again next year that true
love and honorable poverty were better nor riches and a lot more o
that stuff he picked out o them tencent novels he was allus reading
My womenfolks say that he actually liked the girl because she was the
only one in the house that was ever kind to him they say the girls were
just ragin mad at the idea o havin a hired gal who had waited on em
as a sisterinlaw and they even got old Mammy Harcourts back up by
sayin that Johns wife would want to rule the house and run her out
of her own kitchen Some say he shook THEM talked back to em mighty
sharp and held his head a heap higher nor them Anyhow hes livin
with his wife somewhere in Frisco in a shanty on a sand lot and
workin odd jobs for the newspapers No takin it by and largeit
dont look as if Harcourt had run his family to the same advantage that
he has his land

Perhaps he doesnt understand them as well said the stranger smiling

Morn likely the material aint thar or aint as vallyble for a new
country said Peters grimly I reckon the trouble is that he lets them
two daughters run him and the man who lets any woman or women do that
lets himself in for all their meannesses and all he gets in return is a
womans resultshow

Here the stranger who was slowly rising from his chair with the polite
suggestion of reluctantly tearing himself from the speakers spell
said And Harcourt spends most of his time in San Francisco I
suppose

Yes but today hes here to attend a directors meeting and the
opening of the Free Library and Tasajara Hall I saw the windows open
and the blinds up in his house across the plaza as I passed just now

The stranger had by this time quite effected his courteous withdrawal
Goodafternoon Mr Peters he said smilingly lifting his hat and
turned away

Peters who was obliged to take his legs off the chair and half rise
to the strangers politeness here reflected that he did not know his
interlocutors name and business and that he had really got nothing
in return for his information This must be remedied As the stranger
passed through the hall into the street followed by the unwonted
civilities of the spruce hotel clerk and the obsequious attentions of
the negro porter Peters stepped to the window of the office Who was
that man who just passed out he asked

The clerk stared in undisguised astonishment You dont mean to say you
didnt know WHO he wasall the while you were talking to him

No returned Peters impatiently

Why that was Professor Lawrence GrantTHE Lawrence Grantdont you
knowthe biggest scientific man and recognized expert on the Pacific
slope Why thats the man whose single word is enough to make or break
the biggest mine or claim going That manwhy thats the man whose
opinions worth thousands for it carries millions with itand cant be
bought Thats him who knocked the bottom outer El Dorado last year and
next day sent Eureka up booming Ye remember that sure

Of coursebutstammered Peters

And to think you didnt know him repeated the hotel clerk
wonderingly And here I was reckoning you were getting points from him
all the time Why some men would have given a thousand dollars for your
chance of talking to himyesof even being SEEN talking to him
Why old Wingate once got a tip on his Prairie Flower lead worth five
thousand dollars while just changing seats with him in the cars and
passing the time of day sociable like Why what DID you talk about

Peters with a miserable conviction that he had thrown away a valuable
opportunity in mere idle gossip nevertheless endeavored to look
mysterious as he replied Oh business ginrally Then in the faint
hope of yet retrieving his blunder he inquired How long will he be
here

Dont know I reckon he and Harcourts got something on hand He just
asked if he was likely to be at home or at his office I told him I
reckoned at the house for some of the familyI didnt get to see who
they weredrove up in a carriage from the 340 train while you were
sitting there

Meanwhile the subject of this discussion quite unconscious of the
sensation he had created or perhaps like most heroes philosophically
careless of it was sauntering indifferently towards Harcourts house
But he had no business with his former host his only object was to pass
an idle hour before his train left He was of course not unaware that
he himself was largely responsible for Harcourts success that it was
HIS hint which had induced the petty trader of Sidon to venture his all
in Tasajara HIS knowledge of the topography and geology of the
plain that had stimulated Harcourts agricultural speculations HIS
hydrographic survey of the creek that had made Harcourts plan of
widening the channel to commerce practicable and profitable This he
could not help but know But that it was chiefly owing to his own clear
cool farseeing but never visionary scientific observationhis
own accurate analysis unprejudiced by even a savants enthusiasm and
uninfluenced by any personal desire or greed of gainthat Tasajara
City had risen from the stagnant tules was a speculation that had never
occurred to him There was a much more uneasy consciousness of what he
had done in Mr Harcourts face a few moments later when his visitors
name was announced and it is to be feared that if that name had been
less widely honored and respected than it was no merely grateful
recollection of it would have procured Grant an audience As it was
it was with a frown and a touch of his old impatient asperity that he
stepped to the threshold of an adjoining room and called Clemmy

Clementina appeared at the door

Theres that man Grant in the parlor What brings HIM here I wonder
Who does he come to see

Who did he ask for

Mebut that dont mean anything

Perhaps he wants to see you on some business

No That isnt his hightoned style He makes other people go to him
for that he said bitterly Anyhowdont you think its mighty queer
his coming here after his friendfor it was he who introduced Rice
to ushad behaved so to your sister and caused all this divorce and
scandal

Perhaps he may know nothing about it he and Rice separated long ago
even before Grant became so famous We never saw much of him you know
after we came here Suppose you leave him to ME Ill see him

Mr Harcourt reflected Didnt he used to be rather attentive to
Phemie

Clementina shrugged her shoulders carelessly I dare saybut I dont
think that NOW

Who said anything about NOW retorted her father with a return of his
old abruptness After a pause he said Ill go down and see him first
and then send for you You can keep him for the opening and dinner if
you like

Meantime Lawrence Grant serenely unsuspicious of these domestic
confidences had been shown into the parlora large room furnished in
the same style as the drawingroom of the hotel he had just quitted
He had ample time to note that it was that wonderful Second Empire
furniture which he remembered that the early San Francisco pioneers in
the first flush of their wealth had imported directly from France and
which for years after gave an unexpected foreign flavor to the western
domesticity and a tawdry gilt equality to saloons and drawingrooms
public and private But he was observant of a corresponding change in
Harcourt when a moment later he entered the room That individuality
which had kept the former shopkeeper of Sidon distinct from although
perhaps not superior to his customerswas strongly marked He was
perhaps now more nervously alert than then he was certainly more
impatient than beforebut that was pardonable in a man of
large affairs and action Grant could not deny that he seemed
improvedrather perhaps that the setting of fine clothes cleanliness
and the absence of petty worries made his characteristics respectable
That which is ill breeding in homespun is apt to become mere
eccentricity in purple and fine linen Grant felt that Harcourt
jarred on him less than he did before and was grateful without
superciliousness Harcourt relieved to find that Grant was neither
critical nor aggressively reminiscent and above all not inclined to
claim the credit of creating him and Tasajara became more confident
more at his ease and I fear in proportion more unpleasant It is the
repose and not the struggle of the parvenu that confounds us

And YOU Grantyou have made yourself famous and I hear have got
pretty much your own prices for your opinions ever since it was known
that youyouerwere connected with the growth of Tasajara

Grant smiled he was not quite prepared for this but it was amusing
and would pass the time He murmured a sentence of half ironical
deprecation and Mr Harcourt continued

I havent got my San Francisco house here to receive you in but I hope
some day sir to see you there We are only here for the day and night
but if you care to attend the opening ceremonies at the new hall we
can manage to give you dinner afterwards You can escort my daughter
Clementinashes here with me

The smile of apologetic declination which had begun to form on Grants
lips was suddenly arrested Then your daughter is here he asked with
unaffected interest

Yesshe is in fact a patroness of the library and sewingcircle and
takes the greatest interest in it The Reverend Doctor Pilsbury relies
upon her for everything She runs the society even to the training of
the young ladies sir You shall see their exercises

This was certainly a new phase of Clementinas character Yet why should
she not assume the role of Lady Bountiful with the other functions of
her new condition I should have thought Miss Harcourt would have found
this rather difficult with her other social duties he said and would
have left it to her married sister He thought it better not to appear
as if avoiding reference to Euphemia although quietly ignoring her late
experiences Mr Harcourt was less easy in his response

Now that Euphemia is again with her own family he said ponderously
with an affectation of social discrimination that was in weak contrast
to his usual direct business astuteness I suppose she may take her
part in these things but just now she requires rest You may have heard
some rumor that she is going abroad for a time The fact is she hasnt
the least intention of doing so nor do we consider there is the
slightest reason for her going He paused as if to give great emphasis
to a statement that seemed otherwise unimportant But heres Clementina
coming and I must get you to excuse ME Ive to meet the trustees of
the church in ten minutes but I hope shell persuade you to stay and
Ill see you later at the hall

As Clementina entered the room her father vanished and I fear
as completely dropped out of Mr Grants mind For the daughters
improvement was greater than her fathers yet so much more refined as
to be at first only delicately perceptible Grant had been prepared for
the vulgar enhancement of fine clothes and personal adornment for the
specious setting of luxurious circumstances and surroundings for the
aplomb that came from flattery and conscious power But he found none of
these her calm individuality was intensified rather than subdued she
was dressed simply with an economy of ornament rich material and
jewelry but an accuracy of taste that was always dominant Her plain
gray merino dress beautifully fitting her figure suggested with
its pale blue facings some uniform as of the charitable society she
patronized She came towards him with a graceful movement of greeting
yet her face showed no consciousness of the interval that had elapsed
since they met he almost fancied himself transported back to the
sittingroom at Sidon with the monotonous patter of the leaves outside
and the cool moist breath of the bay and alder coming in at the window

Father says that you are only passing through Tasajara today as you
did through Sidon five years ago she said with a smiling earnestness
that he fancied however was the one new phase of her character But
I wont believe it At least we will not accept another visit quite as
accidental as that even though you brought us twice the good fortune
you did then You see we have not forgotten it if you have Mr Grant
And unless you want us to believe that your fairy gifts will turn some
day to leaves and ashes you will promise to stay with us tonight and
let me show you some of the good we have done with them Perhaps
you dont know or dont want to know that it was I who got up this
Library and Home Circle of the Sisters of Tasajara which we are
to open today And can you imagine why You rememberor have you
forgottenthat you once affected to be concerned at the social
condition of the young ladies on the plains of Sidon Well Mr Grant
this is gotten up in order that the future Mr Grants who wander may
find future Miss Billingses who are worthy to converse with them and
entertain them and who no longer wear mens hats and live on the public
road

It was such a long speech for one so taciturn as he remembered
Clementina to have been so unexpected in tone considering her fathers
attitude towards him and so unlooked for in its reference to a slight
incident of the past that Grants critical contemplation of her gave
way to a quiet and grateful glance of admiration How could he have
been so mistaken in her character He had always preferred the outspoken
Euphemia and yet why should he not have been equally mistaken in
her Without having any personal knowledge of Rices matrimonial
troublesfor their intimate companionship had not continued after the
surveyhe had been inclined to blame him now he seemed to find excuses
for him He wondered if she really had liked him as Peters had hinted
he wondered if she knew that he Grant was no longer intimate with him
and knew nothing of her affairs All this while he was accepting her
proffered hospitality and sending to the hotel for his luggage Then
he drifted into a conversation which he had expected would be brief
pointless and confined to a stupid resume of their mutual and social
progress since they had left Sidon But here he was again mistaken she
was talking familiarly of present social topics of things that she knew
clearly and well without effort or attitude She had been to New
York and Boston for two winters she had spent the previous summer at
Newport it might have been her whole youth for the fluency accuracy
and familiarity of her detail and the absence of provincial enthusiasm
She was going abroad probably in the spring She had thought of going
to winter in Italy but she would wait now until her sister was ready to
go with her Mr Grant of course knew that Euphemia was separated from
Mr Ricenonot until her father told him Wellthe marriage had been
a wild and foolish thing for both But Euphemia was back again with them
in the San Francisco house she had talked of coming to Tasajara today
perhaps she might be there tonight And good heavens it was actually
three oclock already and they must start at once for the Hall She
would go and get her hat and return instantly

It was true he had been talking with her an hourpleasantly
intelligently and yet with a consciousness of an indefinite
satisfaction beyond all this It must have been surprise at her
transformation or his previous misconception of her character He had
been watching her features and wondering why he had ever thought them
expressionless There was also the pleasant suggestioncommon to
humanity in such instancesthat he himself was in some way responsible
for the change that it was some awakened sympathy to his own nature
that had breathed into this cold and faultless statue the warmth of
life In an odd flash of recollection he remembered how five years ago
when Rice had suggested to her that she was hard to please she had
replied that she didnt know but that she was waiting to see It did
not occur to him to wonder why she had not awakened then or if this
awakening had anything to do with her own volition It was not probable
that they would meet again after today or if they did that she would
not relapse into her former self and fail to impress him as she had now
Buthere she wasa paragon of feminine promptitudealready standing
in the doorway accurately gloved and booted and wearing a demure gray
hat that modestly crowned her decorously elegant figure

They crossed the plaza side by side in the still garish sunlight that
seemed to mock the scant shade of the youthful eucalyptus trees and
presently fell in with the stream of people going in their direction
The former daughters of Sidon the Billingses the Peterses and
Wingates were there bourgeoning and expanding in the glare of their new
prosperity with silk and gold there were newer faces still and pretty
onesfor Tasajara as a Cow County had attracted settlers with large
familiesand there were already the contrasting types of East and
West Many turned to look after the tall figure of the daughter of the
Founder of Tasajaraa spectacle lately rare to the town a few glanced
at her companion equally noticeable as a stranger Thanks however to
some judicious preliminary advertising from the hotel clerk Peters and
Daniel Harcourt himself by the time Grant and Miss Harcourt had reached
the Hall his name and fame were already known and speculation had
already begun whether this new stroke of Harcourts shrewdness might not
unite Clementina to a renowned and profitable partner

The Hall was in one of the further and newly opened suburbs and its
side and rear windows gave immediately upon the outlying and illimitable
plain of Tasajara It was a tasteful and fairseeming structure of wood
surprisingly and surpassingly new In fact that was its one dominant
feature nowhere else had youth and freshness ever shown itself
as unconquerable and allconquering The spice of virgin woods and
trackless forests still rose from its pine floors and breathed from its
outer shell of cedar that still oozed its sap and redwood that still
dropped its lifeblood Nowhere else were the plastered walls and
ceilings as white and dazzling in their unstained purity or as redolent
of the outlying quarry in their clear cool breath of lime and stone
Even the turpentine of fresh and spotless paint added to this sense
of wholesome germination and as the clear and brilliant Californian
sunshine swept through the open windows west and east suffusing the
whole palpitating structure with its searching and resistless radiance
the very air seemed filled with the aroma of creation

The fresh colors of the young Republic the bright blazonry of the
newest State the coatofarms of the infant County of Tasajaraa
vignette of sunsettules cloven by the steam of an advancing
trainhanging from the walls were all a part of this invincible
juvenescence Even the newest silks ribbons and prints of the latest
holiday fashions made their first virgin appearance in the new building
as if to consecrate it until it was stirred by the rustle of youth as
with the sound and movement of budding spring

A strain from the new organwhose heart however had prematurely
learned its own bitternessand a thin clear but somewhat shrill
chanting from a choir of young ladies were followed by a prayer from the
Reverend Mr Pilsbury Then there was a pause of expectancy and Grants
fair companion who up to that moment had been quietly acting as guide
and cicerone to her fathers guest excused herself with a little
grimace of mock concern and was led away by one of the committee
Grants usually keen eyes were wandering somewhat abstractedly over the
agitated and rustling field of ribbons flowers and feathers before him
past the blazonry of banner on the walls and through the open windows
to the long sunlit levels beyond when he noticed a stir upon the raised
dais or platform at the end of the room where the notables of Tasajara
were formally assembled The mass of black coats suddenly parted and
drew back against the wall to allow the coming forward of a single
graceful figure A thrill of nervousness as unexpected as unaccountable
passed over him as he recognized Clementina In the midst of a sudden
silence she read the report of the committee from a paper in her hand
in a clear untroubled voicethe old voice of Sidonand formally
declared the building opened The sunlight nearly level streamed
through the western window across the front of the platform where she
stood and transfigured her slight but noble figure The hush that had
fallen upon the Hall was as much the effect of that tranquil ideal
presence as of the message with which it was charged And yet that
apparition was as inconsistent with the clear searching light
which helped to set it off as it was with the broad new blazonry of
decoration the yet unsullied record of the white walls or even the
frank animated and pretty faces that looked upon it Perhaps it was
some such instinct that caused the applause which hesitatingly and
tardily followed her from the platform to appear polite and half
restrained rather than spontaneous

Nevertheless Grant was honestly and sincerely profuse in his
congratulations You were far cooler and far more selfcontained than I
should have been in your place he said than in fact I actually WAS
only as your auditor But I suppose you have done it before

She turned her beautiful eyes on his wonderingly Nothis is the
first time I ever appeared in publicnot even at school for even
there I was always a private pupil

You astonish me said Grant you seemed like an old hand at it

Perhaps I did or rather as if I didnt think anything of it
myselfand that no doubt is why the audience didnt think anything of
it either

So she HAD noticed her cold reception and yet there was not the
slightest trace of disappointment regret or wounded vanity in her
tone or manner You must take me to the refreshment room now she
said pleasantly and help me to look after the young ladies who are my
guests Im afraid there are still more speeches to come and father and
Mr Pilsbury are looking as if they confidently expected something more
would be expected of them

Grant at once threw himself into the task assigned to him with his
natural gallantry and a certain captivating playfulness which he still
retained Perhaps he was the more anxious to please in order that his
companion might share some of his popularity for it was undeniable that
Miss Harcourt still seemed to excite only a constrained politeness
among those with whom she courteously mingled And this was still more
distinctly marked by the contrast of a later incident

For some moments the sound of laughter and greeting had risen near the
door of the refreshment room that opened upon the central hall and
there was a perceptible movement of the crowdparticularly of youthful
male Tasajarain that direction It was evident that it announced the
unexpected arrival of some popular resident Attracted like the others
Grant turned and saw the company making way for the smiling easy
halfsaucy halfcomplacent entry of a handsomely dressed young girl As
she turned from time to time to recognize with rallying familiarity or
charming impertinence some of her admirers there was that in her
tone and gesture which instantly recalled to him the past It was
unmistakably Euphemia His eyes instinctively sought Clementinas She
was gazing at him with such a grave penetrating lookhalf doubting
half wistfula look so unlike her usual unruffled calm that he felt
strangely stirred But the next moment when she rejoined him the look
had entirely gone You have not seen my sister since you were at Sidon
I believe she said quietly She would be sorry to miss you But
Euphemia and her train were already passing them on the opposite side of
the long table She had evidently recognized Grant yet the two sisters
were looking intently into each others eyes when he raised his own
Then Euphemia met his bow with a momentary accession of color a
coquettish wave of her hand across the table a slight exaggeration of
her usual fascinating recklessness and smilingly moved away He turned
to Clementina but here an ominous tapping at the farther end of the
long table revealed the fact that Mr Harcourt was standing on a chair
with oratorical possibilities in his face and attitude There was
another forward movement in the crowd andsilence In that solid
blackbroadclothed respectable figure that massive watchchain that
white waistcoat that diamond pin glistening in the satin cravat
Euphemia might have seen the realization of her prophetic vision at
Sidon five years before

He spoke for ten minutes with a fluency and comprehensive businesslike
directness that surprised Grant He was not there he said to glorify
what had been done by himself his family or his friends in Tasajara
Others who were to follow him might do that or at least might be better
able to explain and expatiate upon the advantages of the institution
they had just opened and its social moral and religious effect upon
the community He was there as a business man to demonstrate to
themas he had always done and always hoped to dothe money value
of improvement the profitif they might choose to call itof
wellregulated and properly calculated speculation The plot of land
upon which they stood of which the building occupied only one eighth
was bought two years before for ten thousand dollars When the plans
of the building were completed a month afterwards the value of the
remaining seven eighths had risen enough to defray the cost of the
entire construction He was in a position to tell them that only that
morning the adjacent property subdivided and laid out in streets and
buildingplots had been admitted into the corporate limits of the city
and that on the next anniversary of the building they would approach
it through an avenue of finished dwellings An outburst of applause
followed the speakers practical climax the fresh young faces of his
auditors glowed with invincible enthusiasm the afternoon tradewinds
freshening over the limitless plain beyond tossed the bright banners
at the windows as with sympathetic rejoicing and a few odorous pine
shavings overlooked in a corner in the hurry of preparation touched
by an eddying zephyr crept out and rolled in yellow ringlets across the
floor

The Reverend Doctor Pilsbury arose in a more decorous silence He had
listened approvingly admiringly he might say even reverently to the
preceding speaker But although his distinguished friend had with his
usual modesty made light of his own services and those of his charming
family he the speaker had not risen to sing his praises No it
was not in this Hall projected by his foresight and raised by his
liberality in this town called into existence by his energy and
stamped by his attributes in this county developed by his genius and
sustained by his capital ay in this very State whose grandeur was made
possible by such giants as heit was not in any of these places that
it was necessary to praise Daniel Harcourt or that a panegyric of him
would be more than idle repetition Nor would he as that distinguished
man had suggested enlarge upon the social moral and religious
benefits of the improvement they were now celebrating It was written
on the happy innocent faces in the festive garb in the decorous
demeanor in the intelligent eyes that sparkled around him in the
presence of those of his parishioners whom he could meet as freely here
today as in his own church on Sunday What then could he say What then
was there to say Perhaps he should say nothing if it were not for
the presence of the young before himHe stopped and fixed his eyes
paternally on the youthful Johnny Billings who with a half dozen
other Sundayschool scholars had been marshaled before the reverend
speakerAnd what was to be the lesson THEY were to learn from it They
had heard what had been achieved by labor enterprise and diligence
Perhaps they would believe and naturally too that what labor
enterprise and diligence had done could be done again But was that
all Was there nothing behind these qualitieswhich after all were
within the reach of every one here Had they ever thought that back
of every pioneer every explorer every pathfinder every founder and
creator there was still another There was no terra incognita so rare
as to be unknown to one no wilderness so remote as to be beyond a
greater ken than theirs no waste so trackless but that one had already
passed that way Did they ever reflect that when the dull sea ebbed and
flowed in the tules over the very spot where they were now standing who
it was that also foresaw conceived and ordained the mighty change that
would take place who even guided and directed the feeble means employed
to work it whose spirit moved as in still older days of which they had
read over the face of the stagnant waters Perhaps they had Who then
was the real pioneer of Tasajaraback of the Harcourts the Peterses
the Billingses and Wingates The reverend gentleman gently paused for
a reply It was given in the clear but startled accents of the half
frightened halffascinated Johnny Billings in three words

Lige Curtis sir




CHAPER VI


The trade wind that blowing directly from the Golden Gate seemed to
concentrate its full force upon the western slope of Russian Hill
might have dismayed any climber less hopeful and sanguine than that most
imaginative of newspaper reporters and most youthful of husbands John
Milton Harcourt But for all that it was an honest wind and its dry
practical energy and saltpervading breath only seemed to sting him to
greater and more enthusiastic exertions until quite at the summit of
the hill and last of a straggling line of little cottages half submerged
in drifting sand he stood upon his own humble porch

I was thinking coming up the hill Loo he said bursting into the
sittingroom pantingly of writing something about the future of the
hill How it will look fifty years from now all terraced with houses
and gardensand right up here a kind of Acropolis dont you know I
had quite a picture of it in my mind just now

A plainlydressed young woman with a pretty face that however looked
as if it had been prematurely sapped of color and vitality here laid
aside some white sewing she had in her lap and said

But you did that once before Milty and you know the Herald wouldnt
take it because they said it was a free notice of Mr Boorems building
lots and he didnt advertise in the Herald I always told you that
you ought to have seen Boorem first

The young fellow blinked his eyes with a momentary arrest of that
buoyant hopefulness which was their peculiar characteristic but
nevertheless replied with undaunted cheerfulness I forgot Anyhow
its all the same for I worked it into that Sunday Walk And its
just as easy to write it the other way you seelooking back DOWN THE
HILL you know Something about the old Padres toiling through the sand
just before the Angelus or as far back as Sir Francis Drakes time
and have a runaway boats crew coming ashore to look for gold that the
Mexicans had talked of Lord thats easy enough I tell you what Loo
its worth living up here just for the inspiration Even while boyishly
exhaling this enthusiasm he was also divesting himself of certain
bundles whose contents seemed to imply that he had brought his
dinner with himthe youthful Mrs Harcourt setting the table in a
perfunctory listless way that contrasted oddly with her husbands
cheerful energy

You havent heard of any regular situation yet she asked
abstractedly

Nonot exactly he replied But buoyantly its a great deal
better for me not to take anything in a hurry and tie myself to any
particular line Now Im quite free

And I suppose you havent seen that Mr Fletcher again she continued

No He only wanted to know something about me Thats the way with them
all Loo Whenever I apply for work anywhere its always So youre
Danl Harcourts son eh Quarreled with the old man Bad job better
make it up Youll make more stickin to him Hes worth millions
Everybody seems to think everything of HIM as if I had no individuality
beyond that Ive a good mind to change my name

And pray what would mine be then

There was so much irritation in her voice that he drew nearer her and
gently put his arm around her waist Why whatever mine was darling
he said with a tender smile You didnt fall in love with any
particular name did you Loo

No but I married a particular one she said quickly

His eyelids quivered again as if he was avoiding some unpleasantly
staring suggestion and she stopped

You know what I mean dear she said with a quick little laugh Just
because your fathers an old crosspatch YOU havent lost your rights to
his name and property And those people who say you ought to make it up
perhaps know whats for the best

But you remember what he said of you Loo said the young man with a
flashing eye Do you think I can ever forget that

But you DO forget it dear you forget it when you go in town among
fresh faces and people when you are looking for work You forget it
when youre at work writing your copyfor Ive seen you smile as
you wrote You forget it climbing up the dreadful sand for you were
thinking just now of what happened years ago or is to happen years to
come And I want to forget it too Milty I dont want to sit here all
day thinking of it with the wind driving the sand against the window
and nothing to look at but those white tombs in Lone Mountain Cemetery
and those white caps that might be gravestones too and not a soul to
talk to or even see pass by until I feel as if I were dead and buried
also If you were meyouyouyoucouldnt help crying too

Indeed he was very near it now For as he caught her in his arms
suddenly seeing with a lovers sympathy and the poets swifter
imagination all that she had seen and even more he was aghast at the
vision conjured In her delicate health and loneliness how dreadful must
have been these monotonous days and this glittering cruel sea What
a selfish brute he was Yet as he stood there holding her silently and
rhythmically marking his tenderness and remorseful feelings by rocking
her from side to side like a languid metronome she quietly disengaged
her wet lashes from his shoulder and said in quite another tone

So they were all at Tasajara last week

Who dear

Your father and sisters

Yes said John Milton hesitatingly

And theyve taken back your sister after her divorce

The staring obtrusiveness of this fact apparently made her husbands
bright sympathetic eye blink as before

And if you were to divorce me YOU would be taken back too she
added quickly suddenly withdrawing herself with a pettish movement and
walking to the window

But he followed Dont talk in that way Loo Dont look in that way
dear he said taking her hand gently yet not without a sense of some
inconsistency in her conduct that jarred upon his own simple directness
You know that nothing can part us now I was wrong to let my little
girl worry herself all alone here but IIthought it was all soso
bright and free out on this hilllooking far away beyond the Golden
Gateas far as Cathay you know and such a change from those dismal
flats of Tasajara and that awful stretch of tules But its all right
now And now that I know how you feel well go elsewhere

She did not reply Perhaps she found it difficult to keep up her injured
attitude in the face of her husbands gentleness Perhaps her attention
had been attracted by the unusual spectacle of a stranger who had just
mounted the hill and was now slowly passing along the line of
cottages with a hesitating air of inquiry He may be looking for this
housefor you she said in an entirely new tone of interest Run out
and see It may be some one who wants

An article said Milton cheerfully By Jove he IS coming here

The stranger was indeed approaching the little cottage and with
apparently some confidence He was a welldressed wellmade man whose
age looked uncertain from the contrast between his heavy brown moustache
and his hair that curling under the brim of his hat was almost white
in color The young man started and said hurriedly I really believe
it is Fletcherthey say his hair turned white from the Panama fever

It was indeed Mr Fletcher who entered and introduced himselfa gentle
reserved man with something of that colorlessness of premature age
in his speech which was observable in his hair He had heard of Mr
Harcourt from a friend who had recommended him highly As Mr Harcourt
had probably been told he the speaker was about to embark some
capital in a firstclass newspaper in San Francisco and should select
the staff himself He wanted to secure only firstrate talentbut
above all youthfulness directness and originality The Clarion for
that was to be its name was to have nothing old fogy about it No It
was distinctly to be the organ of Young California This and much more
from the grave lips of the elderly young man whose speech seemed to be
divided between the pretty but equally faded young wife and the one
personification of invincible youth presenther husband

But I fear I have interrupted your household duties he said
pleasantly You were preparing dinner Pray go on And let me help
youIm not a bad cookand you can give me my reward by letting me
share it with you for the climb up here has sharpened my appetite We
can talk as we go on

It was in vain to protest there was something paternal as well as
practical in the camaraderie of this actual capitalist and possible
Maecenas and patron as he quietly hung up his hat and overcoat and
helped to set the table with a practiced hand Nor as he suggested did
the conversation falter and before they had taken their seats at the
frugal board he had already engaged John Milton Harcourt as assistant
editor of the Clarion at a salary that seemed princely to this son
of a millionaire The young wife meantime had taken active part in the
discussion whether it was vaguely understood that the possession of
poetical and imaginative faculties precluded any capacity for business
or whether it was owing to the apparent superior maturity of Mrs
Harcourt and the stranger it was certain that THEY arranged the
practical details of the engagement and that the youthful husband sat
silent merely offering his always hopeful and sanguine consent

Youll take a house nearer to town I suppose continued Mr Fletcher
to the lady though youve a charming view here I suppose it was quite
a change from Tasajara and your fatherinlaws house I daresay he had
as fine a place thereon his own homesteadas he has here

Young Harcourt dropped his sensitive eyelids again It seemed hard that
he could never get away from these allusions to his father Perhaps it
was only to that relationship that he was indebted for his visitors
kindness In his simple honesty he could not bear the thought of such
a misapprehension Perhaps Mr Fletcher you do not know he said
that my father is not on terms with me and that we neither expect
anything nor could we ever take anything from him Could we Loo He
added the useless question partly because he saw that his wifes face
betrayed little sympathy with him and partly that Fletcher was looking
at her curiously as if for confirmation But this was another of John
Miltons trials as an imaginative reporter nobody ever seemed to care
for his practical opinions or facts

Mr Fletcher is not interested in our little family differences
Milty she said looking at Mr Fletcher however instead of him
Youre Daniel Harcourts SON whatever happens

The cloud that had passed over the young mans face and eyes did not
however escape Mr Fletchers attention for he smiled and added
gayly And I hope my valued lieutenant in any case Nevertheless John
Milton was quite ready to avail himself of an inspiration to fetch some
cigars for his guest from the bar of the SeaView House on the slope of
the hill beyond and thereby avoid a fateful subject Once in the fresh
air again he promptly recovered his boyish spirits The light flying
scud had already effaced the first rising stars the lower creeping
seafog had already blotted out the western shore and sea but below him
to the east the glittering lights of the city seemed to start up with a
new mysterious and dazzling brilliancy It was the valley of diamonds
that Sindbad saw lying almost at his feet Perhaps somewhere there the
light of his own fame and fortune was already beginning to twinkle

He returned to his humble roof joyous and inspired As he entered the
hall he heard his wifes voice and his own name mentioned followed
by that awkward meaningless silence on his entrance which so plainly
indicated either that he had been the subject of conversation or that it
was not for his ears It was a dismal reminder of his boyhood at Sidon
and Tasajara But he was too full of hope and ambition to heed it
tonight and later when Mr Fletcher had taken his departure his
pentup enthusiasm burst out before his youthful partner Had she
realized that their struggles were over now that their future was
secure They need no longer fear ever being forced to take bounty from
the family they were independent of them all He would make a name for
himself that should be distinct from his fathers as he should make a
fortune that would be theirs alone The young wife smiled But all
that need not prevent you dear from claiming your RIGHTS when the time
comes

But if I scorn to make the claim or take a penny of his Loo

You say you scorn to take the money you think your father got by a mere
trickat the bestand didnt earn And now you will be able to show
you can live without it and earn your own fortune Well dear for that
very reason why should you let your father and others enjoy and waste
what is fairly your share For it is YOUR share whether it came to your
father fairly or not and if not it is still your duty believing as
you do to claim it from him that at least YOU may do with it what you
choose You might want to restore ittotosomebody

The young man laughed But my dear Loo suppose that I were weak
enough to claim it do you think my father would give it up He has the
right and no law could force him to yield to me more than he chooses

Not the law but YOU could

I dont understand you he said quickly

You could force him by simply telling him what you once told me

John Milton drew back and his hand dropped loosely from his wifes
The color left his fresh young face the light quivered for a moment
and then became fixed and set in his eyes For that moment he looked ten
years her senior I was wrong ever to tell even you that Loo he said
in a low voice You are wrong to ever remind me of it Forget it
from this moment as you value our love and want it to live and be
remembered And forget Loo as I doand ever shallthat you ever
suggested to me to use my secret in the way you did just now

But here Mrs Harcourt burst into tears more touched by the alteration
in her husbands manner I fear than by any contrition for wrongdoing
Of course if he wished to withdraw his confidences from her just as he
had almost confessed he wished to withdraw his NAME she couldnt help
it but it was hard that when she sat there all day long trying to think
what was best for them she should be blamed At which the quiet and
forgiving John Milton smiled remorsefully and tried to comfort her
Nevertheless an occasional odd indefinable chill seemed to creep
across the feverish enthusiasm with which he was celebrating this day of
fortune And yet he neither knew nor suspected until long after that his
foolish wife had that night half betrayed his secret to the stranger

The next day he presented a note of introduction from Mr Fletcher to
the business manager of the Clarion and the following morning was
duly installed in office He did not see his benefactor again that
single visit was left in the mystery and isolation of an angelic
episode It later appeared that other and larger interests in the San
Jose valley claimed his patrons residence and attendance only the
capital and general purpose of the paperto develop into a party
organ in the interest of his possible senatorial aspirations in due
seasonwas furnished by him Grateful as John Milton felt towards him
he was relieved it seemed probable that Mr Fletcher HAD selected him
on his individual merits and not as the son of a millionaire

He threw himself into his work with his old hopeful enthusiasm
and perhaps an originality of method that was part of his singular
independence Without the students training or restraintfor his two
years schooling at Tasajara during his parents prosperity came too
late to act as a disciplinehe was unfettered by any rules and guided
only by an unerring instinctive taste that became near being genius
He was a brilliant and original if not always a profound and accurate
reporter By degrees he became an accustomed interest to the readers
of the Clarion then an influence Actors themselves in many a fierce
drama living lives of devotion emotion and picturesque incident they
had satisfied themselves with only the briefest and most practical daily
record of their adventure and even at first were dazed and startled
to find that many of them had been heroes and some poets The stealthy
boyish reader of romantic chronicle at Sidon had learned by heart the
chivalrous story of the emigration The second column of the Clarion
became famous even while the figure of its youthful writer unknown and
unrecognized was still nightly climbing the sands of Russian Hill and
even looking down as before on the lights of the growing city without a
thought that he had added to that glittering constellation

Cheerful and contented with the exercise of work he would have been
happy but for the gradual haunting of another dread which presently
began to drag him at earlier hours up the steep path to his little home
to halt him before the door with the quickened breath of an anxiety he
would scarcely confess to himself and sometimes hold him aimlessly a
whole day beneath his roof For the pretty but delicate Mrs Harcourt
like others of her class had added a weak and ineffective maternity
to their other conjugal trials and one early dawn a baby was born that
lingered with them scarcely longer than the morning mist and exhaled
with the rising sun The young wife regained her strength slowlyso
slowly that the youthful husband brought his work at times to the house
to keep her company And a singular change had come over her She no
longer talked of the past nor of his family As if the little life
that had passed with that morning mist had represented some ascending
expiatory sacrifice it seemed to have brought them into closer
communion

Yet her weak condition made him conceal another trouble that had come
upon him It was in the third month of his employment on the Clarion
that one afternoon while correcting some proofs on his chiefs desk he
came upon the following editorial paragraph

The playedout cant of pioneer genius and pioneer discovery appears
to have reached its climax in the attempt of some of our contemporaries
to apply it to Dan Harcourts new Tasajara Job before the legislature
It is perfectly well known in Harcourts own district that far from
being a pioneer and settler HIMSELF he simply succeeded after a
fashion to the genuine work of one Elijah Curtis an actual pioneer
and discoverer years before while Harcourt we believe was keeping a
frontier doggery in Sidon and dispensing tanglefoot and salt junk
to the hayfooted Pike Countians of his precinct This would make him as
much of the pioneer discoverer as the rattlesnake who first takes up
board and lodgings and then possession in a prairie dogs burrow And if
the travelers tale is true that the rattlesnake sometimes makes a meal
of his landlord the story told at Sidon may be equally credible that
the original pioneer mysteriously disappeared about the time that Dan
Harcourt came into the property From which it would seem that Harcourt
is not in a position for his friends to invite very deep scrutiny into
his pioneer achievements

Stupefaction a vague terror and rising anger rapidly succeeded each
other in the young mans mind as he stood mechanically holding the
paper in his hand It was the writing of his chief editor whose easy
brutality he had sometimes even boyishly admired Without stopping to
consider their relative positions he sought him indignantly and laid the
proof before him The editor laughed But whats that to YOU YOURE
not on terms with the old man

But he is my father said John Milton hotly

Look here said the editor goodnaturedly Id like to oblige
you but it isnt BUSINESS you knowand this IS you
understandPROPRIETORS BUSINESS too Of course I see it might stand
in the way of your making up to the old man afterwards and coming in for
a million Well you can tell him its ME Say I WOULD put it in Say
Im nastyand I AM

Then it must go in said John Milton with a white face

You bet

Then I must go out And writing out his resignation he laid it before
his chief and left

But he could not bear to tell this to his wife when he climbed the hill
that night and he invented some excuse for bringing his work home The
invalid never noticed any change in his usual buoyancy and indeed I
fear when he was fairly installed with his writing materials at the
foot of her bed he had quite forgotten the episode He was recalled to
it by a faint sigh

What is it dear he said looking up

I like to see you writing Milty You always look so happy

Always so happy dear

Yes You are happy are you not

Always He got up and kissed her Nevertheless when he sat down to
his work again his face was turned a little more to the window

Another serious incidentto be also kept from the invalidshortly
followed The article in the Clarion had borne its fruit The third
day after his resignation a rival paper sharply retorted The cowardly
insinuations against the record of a justly honored capitalist said
the Pioneer although quite in keeping with the brazen Clarion
might attract the attentions of the slandered party if it were not
known to his friends as well as himself that it may be traced almost
directly to a castoff member of his own family who it seems is
reduced to haunting the back doors of certain blatant journals to
dispose of his cheap wares The slanderer is secure from public exposure
in the superior decency of his relations who refrain from airing their
family linen upon editorial lines

This was the journal to which John Milton had hopefully turned for work
When he read it there seemed but one thing for him to doand he did
it Gentle and optimistic as was his nature he had been brought up in
a community where sincere directness of personal offense was followed by
equally sincere directness of personal redress andhe challenged the
editor The bearer of his cartel was one Jack Hamlin I grieve to say a
gambler by profession but between whom and John Milton had sprung up an
odd friendship of which the best that can be said is that it was to each
equally and unselfishly unprofitable The challenge was accepted the
preliminaries arranged I suppose said Jack carelessly as the old
man ought to do something for your wife in case of accident youve made
some sort of a will

Ive thought of that said John Milton dubiously but Im afraid
its no use You seehe hesitatedIm not of age

May I ask how old you are sonny said Jack with great gravity

Im almost twenty said John Milton coloring

It isnt exactly vingtetun but Id stand on it if I were you I
wouldnt draw to such a hand said Jack coolly

The young husband had arranged to be absent from his home that night
and early morning found him with Jack grave but courageous in a
little hollow behind the Mission Hills To them presently approached his
antagonist jauntily accompanied by Colonel Starbottle his second They
halted but after the formal salutation were instantly joined by Jack
Hamlin For a few moments John Milton remained awkwardly alonepending
a conversation which even at that supreme moment he felt as being
like the general attitude of his friends towards him in its complete
ignoring of himself The next moment the three men stepped towards him
We have come sir said Colonel Starbottle in his precisest speech but
his jauntiest manner to offer you a full and ample apologya personal
apologywhich only supplements that full public apology that my
principal sir this gentleman indicating the editor of the Pioneer
has this morning made in the columns of his paper as you will
observe producing a newspaper We have sir continued the
colonel loftily only within the last twelve hours become aware of
theerREAL circumstances of the case We would regret that the affair
had gone so far already if it had not given us sir the opportunity
of testifying to your gallantry We do so gladly and iferera FEW
YEARS LATER Mr Harcourt you should ever needa friend in any matter
of this kind I am sir at your service John Milton gazed half
inquiringly half uneasily at Jack

Its all right Milt he said sotto voce Shake hands all round and
lets go to breakfast And I rather think that editor wants to employ
you HIMSELF

It was true for when that night he climbed eagerly the steep homeward
hill he carried with him the written offer of an engagement on the
Pioneer As he entered the door his wifes nurse and companion met him
with a serious face There had been a strange and unexpected change in
the patients condition and the doctor had already been there twice
As he put aside his coat and hat and entered her room it seemed to
him that he had forever put aside all else of essay and ambition beyond
those four walls And with the thought a great peace came upon him It
seemed good to him to live for her alone

It was not for long As each monotonous day brought the morning mist and
evening fog regularly to the little hilltop where his whole being was
now centred she seemed to grow daily weaker and the little circle of
her life narrowed day by day One morning when the usual mist appeared
to have been withheld and the sun had risen with a strange and cruel
brightness when the waves danced and sparkled on the bay below and
light glanced from dazzling sails and even the white tombs on Lone
Mountain glittered keenly when cheery voices hailing each other on the
hillside came to him clearly but without sense or meaning when earth
sky and sea seemed quivering with life and motionhe opened the door
of that one little house on which the only shadow seemed to have fallen
and went forth again into the world alone




CHAPER VII


Mr Daniel Harcourts town mansion was also on an eminence but it
was that gentler acclivity of fashion known as Rincon Hill and
sunned itself on a southern slope of luxury It had been described
as princely and fairylike by a grateful reporter tourists and
travelers had sung its praises in letters to their friends and in
private reminiscences for it had dispensed hospitality to most of the
celebrities who had visited the coast Nevertheless its charm was mainly
due to the ruling taste of Miss Clementina Harcourt who had astonished
her father by her marvelous intuition of the nice requirements and
elegant responsibilities of their position and had thrown her mother
into the pained perplexity of a matronly hen who among the ducks eggs
intrusted to her fostering care had unwittingly hatched a graceful but
discomposing cygnet

Indeed after holding out feebly against the siege of wealth at Tasajara
and San Francisco Mrs Harcourt had abandoned herself hopelessly to
the horrors of its invasion had allowed herself to be dragged from her
kitchen by her exultant daughters and set up in black silk in a certain
conventional respectability in the drawingroom Strange to say her
commiserating hospitality or hospitallike ministration not only gave
her popularity but a certain kind of distinction An exaltation
so sorrowfully deprecated by its possessor was felt to be a sign of
superiority She was spoken of as motherly even by those who vaguely
knew that there was somewhere a discarded son struggling in poverty
with a helpless wife and that she had sided with her husband in
disinheriting a daughter who had married unwisely She was sentimentally
spoken of as a true wife while never opposing a single meanness of
her husband suggesting a single active virtue nor questioning her
right to sacrifice herself and her family for his sake With nothing
she cared to affect she was quite free from affectation and even the
critical Lawrence Grant was struck with the dignity which her narrow
simplicity that had seemed small even in Sidon attained in her
palatial hall in San Francisco It appeared to be a perfectly logical
conclusion that when such unaffectedness and simplicity were forced to
assume a hostile attitude to anybody the latter must be to blame

Since the festival of Tasajara Mr Grant had been a frequent visitor
at Harcourts and was a guest on the eve of his departure from San
Francisco The distinguished position of each made their relations
appear quite natural without inciting gossip as to any attraction in
Harcourts daughters It was late one afternoon as he was passing the
door of Harcourts study that his host called him in He found him
sitting at his desk with some papers before him and a folded copy of the
Clarion With his back to the fading light of the window his face was
partly in shadow

By the way Grant he began with an assumption of carelessness
somewhat inconsistent with the fact that he had just called him in it
may be necessary for me to pull up those fellows who are blackguarding
me in the Clarion

Why they havent been saying anything new asked Grant laughingly
as he glanced towards the paper

Nothat isonly a rehash of what they said before returned Harcourt
without opening the paper

Well said Grant playfully you dont mind their saying that youre
NOT the original pioneer of Tasajara for its true nor that that
fellow Lige Curtis disappeared suddenly for he did if I remember
rightly But theres nothing in that to invalidate your rights to
Tasajara to say nothing of your five years undisputed possession

Of course theres no LEGAL question said Harcourt almost sharply
But as a matter of absurd report I may want to contradict their
insinuations And YOU remember all the circumstances dont you

I should think so Why my dear fellow Ive told it everywherehere
in New York Newport and in London by Jove its one of my best
stories How a company sent me out with a surveyor to look up a railroad
and agricultural possibilities in the wilderness how just as I found
themand a rather big thing they made tooI was set afloat by a
flood and a raft and drifted ashore on your bank and practically
demonstrated to you what you didnt know and didnt dare to hope
forthat there could be a waterway straight to Sidon from the
embarcadero Ive told what a charming evening we had with you and
your daughters in the old house and how I returned your hospitality by
giving you a tip about the railroad and how you slipped out while we
were playing cards to clinch the bargain for the land with that drunken
fellow Lige Curtis

Whats that interrupted Harcourt quickly

It was well that the shadow hid from Grant the expression of Harcourts
face or his reply might have been sharper As it was he answered a
little stiffly

I beg your pardon

Harcourt recovered himself Youre all wrong he said that bargain
was made long BEFORE I never saw Lige Curtis after you came to the
house It was before that in the afternoon he went on hurriedly
that he was last in my store I can prove it Nevertheless he was so
shocked and indignant at being confronted in his own suppressions and
falsehoods by an even greater and more astounding misconception of
fact that for a moment he felt helpless What he reflected if it were
alleged that Lige had returned again after the loafers had gone or had
never left the store as had been said Nonsense There was John Milton
who had been there reading all the time and who could disprove it Yes
but John Milton was his discarded sonhis enemyperhaps even his
very slanderer

But said Grant quietly dont you remember that your daughter
Euphemia said something that evening about the land Lige had OFFERED
you and you snapped up the young lady rather sharply for letting out
secrets and THEN you went out At least thats my impression

It was however more than an impression with Grants scientific memory
for characteristic details he had noticed that particular circumstance
as part of the social phenomena

I dont know what Phemie SAID returned Harcourt impatiently I KNOW
there was no offer pending the land had been sold to me before I ever
saw you Whyyou must have thought me up to pretty sharp practice with
Curtiseh he added with a forced laugh

Grant smiled he had been accustomed to hear of such sharp practice
among his business acquaintance although he himself by nature and
profession was incapable of it but he had not deemed Harcourt more
scrupulous than others Perhaps so he said lightly but for Heavens
sake dont ask me to spoil my reputation as a raconteur for the sake of
a mere fact or two I assure you its a mighty taking story as I tell
itand it dont hurt you in a business way Youre the hero of ithang
it all

Yes said Harcourt without noticing Grants half cynical superiority
but youll oblige me if you wont tell it again IN THAT WAY There are
men here mean enough to make the worst of it Its nothing to me of
course but my familythe girls you knoware rather sensitive

I had no idea they even knew itmuch less cared for it said Grant
with sudden seriousness I dare say if those fellows in the Clarion
knew that they were annoying the ladies theyd drop it Whos the
editor Look hereleave it to me Ill look into it Better that you
shouldnt appear in the matter at all

You understand that if it was a really serious matter Grant said
Harcourt with a slight attitude I shouldnt allow any one to take my
place

My dear fellow therell be nobody called out and no shooting at
sight whatever is the result of my interference returned Grant
lightly Itll be all right He was quite aware of the power of his
own independent position and the fact that he had been often appealed to
before in delicate arbitration

Harcourt was equally conscious of this but by a strange inconsistency
now felt relieved at the coolness with which Grant had accepted the
misconception which had at first seemed so dangerous If he were ready
to condone what he thought was SHARP PRACTICE he could not be less
lenient with the real facts that might come outof course always
excepting that interpolated consideration in the bill of sale which
however no one but the missing Curtis could ever discover The fact
that a man of Grants secure position had interested himself in this
matter would secure him from the working of that personal vulgar
jealousy which his humbler antecedents had provoked And if as he
fancied Grant really cared for Clementina

As you like he said with halfaffected lightness and now let us
talk of something else Clementina has been thinking of getting up
a riding party to San Mateo for Mrs Ashwood We must show them some
civility and that Boston brother of hers Mr Shipley will have to
be invited also I cant get away and my wife of course will only
be able to join them at San Mateo in the carriage I reckon it would be
easier for Clementina if you took my place and helped her look after
the riding party It will need a man and I think shed prefer youas
you know shes rather particularunless of course youd be wanted for
Mrs Ashwood or Phemie or somebody else

From his shadowed corner he could see that a pleasant light had sprung
into Grants eyes although his reply was in his ordinary easy banter
I shall be only too glad to act as Miss Clementinas vaquero and lasso
her runaways or keep stragglers in the road

There seemed to be small necessity however for this active
cooperation for when the cheerful cavalcade started from the house
a few mornings later Mr Lawrence Grants onerous duties seemed to be
simply confined to those of an ordinary cavalier at the side of Miss
Clementina a few paces in the rear of the party But this safe distance
gave them the opportunity of conversing without being overheardan
apparently discreet precaution

Your father was so exceedingly affable to me the other day that if I
hadnt given you my promise to say nothing I think I would have fallen
on my knees to him then and there revealed my feelings asked for your
hand and his blessingor whatever one does at such a time But how long
do you intend to keep me in this suspense

Clementina turned her clear eyes half abstractedly upon him as if
imperfectly recalling some forgotten situation You forget she said
that part of your promise was that you wouldnt even speak of it to me
again without my permission

But my time is so short now Give me some definite hope before I go
Let me believe that when we meet in New York

You will find me just the same as now Yes I think I can promise THAT
Let that suffice You said the other day you liked me because I had not
changed for five years You can surely trust that I will not alter in as
many months

If I only knew

Ah if I only knewif WE ALL only knew But we dont Come Mr
Grant let it rest as it is Unless you want to go still further back
and have it as it WAS at Sidon There I think you fancied Euphemia
most

Clementina

That is my name and those people ahead of us know it already

You are called CLEMENTINAbut you are not merciful

You are very wrong for you might see that Mr Shipley has twice
checked his horse that he might hear what you are saying and Phemie is
always showing Mrs Ashwood something in the landscape behind us

All this was the more hopeless and exasperating to Grant since in the
young girls speech and manner there was not the slightest trace of
coquetry or playfulness He could not help saying a little bitterly I
dont think that any one would imagine from your manner that you were
receiving a declaration

But they might imagine from yours that you had the right to quarrel
with mewhich would be worse

We cannot part like this It is too cruel to me

We cannot part otherwise without the risk of greater cruelty

But say at least Clementina that I have no rival There is no other
more favored suitor

That is so like a manand yet so unlike the proud one I believed you
to be Why should a man like you even consider such a possibility If I
were a man I know I couldnt She turned upon him a glance so clear and
untroubled by either conscious vanity or evasion that he was hopelessly
convinced of the truth of her statement and she went on in a slightly
lowered tone You have no right to ask me such a questionbut perhaps
for that reason I am willing to answer you There is none Hush For a
good rider you are setting a poor example to the others by crowding
me towards the bank Go forward and talk to Phemie and tell her not to
worry Mrs Ashwoods horse nor race with her I dont think hes quite
safe and Mrs Ashwood isnt accustomed to using the Spanish bit
I suppose I must say something to Mr Shipley who doesnt seem to
understand that IM acting as chaperon and YOU as captain of the
party

She cantered forward as she spoke and Grant was obliged to join her
sister who mounted on a powerful roan was mischievously exciting
a beautiful quakercolored mustang ridden by Mrs Ashwood already
irritated by the unfamiliar pressure of the Eastern womans hand upon
his bit The thick dust which had forced the party of twenty to close up
in two solid files across the road compelled them at the first opening
in the roadside fence to take the field in a straggling gallop Grant
eager to escape from his own discontented self by doing something for
others reined in beside Euphemia and the fair stranger

Let me take your place until Mrs Ashwoods horse is quieted he half
whispered to Euphemia

Thank youand I suppose it does not make any matter to Clem who
quiets mine she said with provoking eyes and a toss of her head
worthy of the spirited animal she was riding

She thinks you quite capable of managing yourself and even others
he replied with a playful glance at Shipley who was riding somewhat
stiffly on the other side

Dont be too sure retorted Phemie with another dangerous look I may
give you trouble yet

They were approaching the first undulation of the russet plain they had
emerged uponan umbrageous slope that seemed suddenly to diverge
in two defiles among the shaded hills Grant had given a few words of
practical advice to Mrs Ashwood and shown her how to guide her mustang
by the merest caressing touch of the rein upon its sensitive neck He
had not been sympathetically inclined towards the fair stranger a rich
and still youthful widow although he could not deny her unquestioned
good breeding mental refinement and a certain languorous
thoughtfulness that was almost melancholy which accented her blonde
delicacy But he had noticed that her manner was politely reserved and
slightly constrained towards the Harcourts and he had already resented
it with a lovers instinctive loyalty He had at first attributed it
to a want of sympathy between Mrs Ashwoods more intellectual
sentimentalities and the Harcourts undeniable lack of any sentiment
whatever But there was evidently some other innate antagonism He
was very polite to Mrs Ashwood she responded with a gentlewomans
courtesy and he was forced to admit even a broader comprehension
of his own merits than the Harcourt girls had ever shown but he could
still detect that she was not in accord with the party

I am afraid you do not like California Mrs Ashwood he said
pleasantly You perhaps find the life here too unrestrained and
unconventional

She looked at him in quick astonishment Are you quite sincere Why
it strikes me that this is just what it is NOT And I have so longed
for something quite different From what I have been told about the
originality and adventure of everything here and your independence of
old social forms and customs I am afraid I expected the opposite
of what Ive seen Why this very partyexcept that the ladies are
prettier and more expensively gotten upis like any party that might
have ridden out at Saratoga or New York

And as stupid you would say

As CONVENTIONAL Mr Grant always excepting this lovely creature
beneath me whom I cant make out and who doesnt seem to care that I
should There look I told you so

Her mustang had suddenly bounded forward but as Grant followed he
could see that the cause was the example of Phemie who had in some
mad freak dashed out in a frantic gallop A halfdozen of the
younger people hilariously accepted the challenge the excitement was
communicated to the others until the whole cavalcade was sweeping
down the slope Grant was still at Mrs Ashwoods side restraining
her mustang and his own impatient horse when Clementina joined them
Phemies mare has really bolted I fear she said in a quick whisper
ride on and never mind us Grant looked quickly ahead Phemies roan
excited by the shouts behind her and to all appearance ungovernable was
fast disappearing with her rider Without a word trusting to his own
good horsemanship and better knowledge of the ground he darted out of
the cavalcade to overtake her

But the unfortunate result of this was to give further impulse to the
now racing horses as they approached a point where the slope terminated
in two diverging canyons Mrs Ashwood gave a sharp pull upon her
bit To her consternation the mustang stopped short almost
instantlyplanting his two fore feet rigidly in the dust and even
sliding forward with the impetus Had her seat been less firm she might
have been thrown but she recovered herself although in doing so
she still bore upon the bit when to her astonishment the mustang
deliberately stiffened himself as if for a shock and then began to back
slowly quivering with excitement She did not know that her nativebred
animal fondly believed that he was participating in a rodeo and that to
his equine intelligence his fair mistress had just lassoed something
In vain she urged him forward he still waited for the shock When the
cloud of dust in which she had been enwrapped drifted away she saw to
her amazement that she was alone The entire party had disappeared into
one of the canyonsbut which one she could not tell

When she succeeded at last in urging her mustang forward again she
determined to take the righthand canyon and trust to being either met
or overtaken A more practical and less adventurous nature would have
waited at the point of divergence for the return of some of the party
but Mrs Ashwood was in truth not sorry to be left to herself and the
novel scenery for a while and she had no doubt but she would eventually
find her way to the hotel at San Mateo which could not be far away in
time for luncheon

The road was still well defined although it presently began to wind
between ascending ranks of pines and larches that marked the terraces
of hills so high that she wondered she had not noticed them from the
plains An unmistakable suggestion of some haunting primeval solitude
a sense of the hushed and mysterious proximity of a nature she had never
known before the strange halfintoxicating breath of unsunned foliage
and untrodden grasses and herbs all combined to exalt her as she
cantered forward Even her horse seemed to have acquired an intelligent
liberty or rather to have established a sympathy with her in his needs
and her own longings instinctively she no longer pulled him with the
curb the reins hung loosely on his selfarched and unfettered neck
secure in this loneliness she found herself even talking to him with
barbaric freedom As she went on the vague hush of all things animate
and inanimate around her seemed to thicken until she unconsciously
halted before a dim and pillared wood and a vast and heathless opening
on whose mute brown lips Nature seemed to have laid the finger of
silence She forgot the party she had left she forgot the luncheon she
was going to more important still she forgot that she had already left
the traveled track far behind her and tremulous with anticipation
rode timidly into that arch of shadow

As her horses hoofs fell noiselessly on the elastic mosscarpeted aisle
she forgot even more than that She forgot the artificial stimulus and
excitement of the life she had been leading so long she forgot the
small meannesses and smaller worries of her welltodo experiences she
forgot herselfrather she regained a self she had long forgotten
For in the sweet seclusion of this half darkened sanctuary the clinging
fripperies of her past slipped from her as a tawdry garment The
petted spoiled and vapidly precocious girlhood which had merged into
a womanhood of aimless triumphs and meaner ambitions the worldly but
miserable triumph of a marriage that had left her delicacy abused and
her heart sick and unsatisfied the wifehood without home seclusion
or maternity the widowhood that at last brought relief but with it the
consciousness of hopelessly wasted youthall this seemed to drop from
her here as lightly as the winged needles or noiseless withered spray
from the dim gray vault above her head In the sovereign balm of that
woodland breath her better spirit was restored somewhere in these
wholesome shades seemed to still lurk what should have been her innocent
and nymphlike youth and to come out once more and greet her Old songs
she had forgotten or whose music had failed in the discords of her
frivolous life sang themselves to her again in that sweet grave
silence girlish dreams that she had foolishly been ashamed of or had
put away with her childish toys stole back to her once more and became
real in this tender twilight old fancies old fragments of verse and
childish lore grew palpable and moved faintly before her The boyish
prince who should have come was there the babe that should have been
hers was thereshe stopped suddenly with flaming eyes and indignant
color For it appeared that a MAN was there too and had just risen from
the fallen tree where he had been sitting




CHAPER VIII


She had so far forgotten herself in yielding to the spell of the place
and in the revelation of her naked soul and inner nature that it was
with something of the instinct of outraged modesty that she seemed to
shrink before this apparition of the outer world and outer worldliness
In an instant the nearer past returned she remembered where she was
how she had come there from whom she had come and to whom she was
returning She could see that she had not only aimlessly wandered from
the world but from the road and for that instant she hated this man who
had reminded her of it even while she knew she must ask his assistance
It relieved her slightly to observe that he seemed as disturbed and
impatient as herself and as he took a pencil from between his lips and
returned it to his pocket he scarcely looked at her

But with her return to the world of convenances came its repression
and with a gentlewomans ease and modulated voice she leaned over her
mustangs neck and said I have strayed from my party and am afraid I
have lost my way We were going to the hotel at San Mateo Would you be
kind enough to direct me there or show me how I can regain the road by
which I came

Her voice and manner were quite enough to arrest him where he stood with
a pleased surprise in his fresh and ingenuous face She looked at him
more closely He was in spite of his long silken mustache so absurdly
young he might in spite of that youth be so absurdly manlike What
was he doing there Was he a farmers son an artist a surveyor or a
city clerk out for a holiday Was there perhaps a youthful female of his
species somewhere for whom he was waiting and upon whose tryst she was
now breaking Was heterrible thoughtthe outlying picket of some
family picnic His dress neat simple free from ostentatious ornament
betrayed nothing She waited for his voice

Oh you have left San Mateo miles away to the right he said with
quick youthful sympathy at least five miles Where did you leave your
party

His voice was winning and even refined she thought She answered it
quite spontaneously At a fork of two roads I see now I took the wrong
turning

Yes you took the road to Crystal Spring Its just down there in the
valley not more than a mile Youd have been there now if you hadnt
turned off at the woods

I couldnt help it it was so beautiful

Isnt it

Perfect

And such shadows and such intensity of color

Wonderfuland all along the ridge looking down that defile

Yes and that point where it seems as if you had only to stretch out
your hand to pick a manzanita berry from the other side of the canyon
half a mile across

Yes and that first glimpse of the valley through the Gothic gateway of
rocks

And the color of those rockscinnamon and bronze with the light green
of the Yerba buena vine splashing over them

Yes but for color DID you notice that hillside of yellow poppies
pouring down into the valley like a golden Niagara

Certainlyand the perfect clearness of everything

And yet such complete silence and repose

Oh yes

Ah yes

They were both gravely nodding and shaking their heads with sparkling
eyes and brightened color looking not at each other but at the far
landscape vignetted through a lozengeshaped wind opening in the trees
Suddenly Mrs Ashwood straightened herself in the saddle looked grave
lifted the reins and apparently the ten years with them that had dropped
from her But she said in her easiest wellbred tones and a half sigh
Then I must take the road back again to where it forks

Oh no you can go by Crystal Spring Its no further and Ill show
you the way But youd better stop and rest yourself and your horse for
a little while at the Springs Hotel Its a very nice place Many people
ride there from San Francisco to luncheon and return I wonder that your
party didnt prefer it and if they are looking for youas they surely
must be he said as if with a sudden conception of her importance
theyll come there when they find youre not at San Mateo

This seemed reasonable although the process of being fetched and
taking the five miles ride which she had enjoyed so much alone
in company was not attractive Couldnt I go on at once she said
impulsively

You would meet them sooner he said thoughtfully

This was quite enough for Mrs Ashwood I think Ill rest this poor
horse who is really tired she said with charming hypocrisy and
stop at the hotel

She saw his face brighten Perhaps he was the son of the hotel
proprietor or a youthful partner himself I suppose you live here
she suggested gently You seem to know the place so well

No he returned quickly I only run down here from San Francisco when
I can get a day off

A day off He was in some regular employment But he continued And I
used to go to boardingschool near here and know all these woods well

He must be a native How odd She had not conceived that there might
be any other population here than the immigrants perhaps that was what
made him so interesting and different from the others Then your father
and mother live here she said

His frank face incapable of disguise changed suddenly No he said
simply but without any trace of awkwardness Then after a slight
pause he laid his handshe noticed it was white and well kepton her
mustangs neck and said Ifif you care to trust yourself to me I
could lead you and your horse down a trail into the valley that is at
least a third of the distance shorter It would save you going back to
the regular road and there are one or two lovely views that I could
show you I should be so pleased if it would not trouble you Theres a
steep place or twobut I think theres no danger

I shall not be afraid

She smiled so graciously and as she fully believed maternally that
he looked at her the second time To his first hurried impression of
her as an elegant and delicately nurtured womanone of the class of
distinguished tourists that fashion was beginning to send thitherhe
had now to add that she had a quantity of fine silkenspun light hair
gathered in a heavy braid beneath her gray hat that her mouth was
very delicately lipped and beautifully sensitive that her soft skin
although just then touched with excitement was a pale faded velvet and
seemed to be worn with ennui rather than experience that her eyes
were hidden behind a strip of gray veil whence only a faint glow was
discernible To this must still be added a poetic fancy all his own
that as she sat there with the skirt of her gray habit falling from
her long bodiced waist over the mustangs fawncolored flanks and with
her slim gauntleted hands lightly swaying the reins she looked like
Queen Guinevere in the forest Not that he particularly fancied Queen
Guinevere or that he at all imagined himself Launcelot but it was
quite in keeping with the suggestionhaunted brain of John Milton
Harcourt whom the astute reader has of course long since recognized

Preceding her through the soft carpeted vault with a woodmans
instinctfor there was apparently no trail to be seenthe soft inner
twilight began to give way to the outer stronger day and presently she
was startled to see the clear blue of the sky before her on apparently
the same level as the brown pinetessellated floor she was treading Not
only did this show her that she was crossing a ridge of the upland but
a few moments later she had passed beyond the woods to a golden hillside
that sloped towards a leafy sheltered and exquisitelyproportioned
valley A tiny but picturesque tower and a few straggling roofs and
gables the flashing of a crystal stream through the leaves and a
narrow white ribbon of road winding behind it indicated the hostelry
they were seeking So peaceful and unfrequented it looked nestling
between the hills that it seemed as if they had discovered it

With his hand at times upon the bridle at others merely caressing her
mustangs neck he led the way there were a few breathless places where
the crown of his straw hat appeared between her horses reins and again
when she seemed almost slipping over on his shoulder but they were
passed with such frank fearlessness and invincible youthful confidence
on the part of her escort that she felt no timidity There were moments
when a bit of the charmed landscape unfolding before them overpowered
them both and they halted to gazesometimes without a word or only a
significant gesture of sympathy and attention At one of those artistic
manifestations Mrs Ashwood laid her slim gloved fingers lightly but
unwittingly on John Miltons arm and withdrew them however with a
quick girlish apology and a foolish color which annoyed her more than
the appearance of familiarity But they were now getting well down into
the valley the court of the little hotel was already opening before
them their unconventional relations in the idyllic world above had
changed the new one required some delicacy of handling and she had an
idea that even the simplicity of the young stranger might be confusing

I must ask you to continue to act as my escort she said laughingly
I am Mrs Ashwood of Philadelphia visiting San Francisco with my
sister and brother who are I am afraid even now hopelessly waiting
luncheon for me at San Mateo But as there seems to be no prospect of my
joining them in time I hope you will be able to give me the pleasure
of your company with whatever they may give us here in the way of
refreshment

I shall be very happy returned John Milton with unmistakable candor
but perhaps some of your friends will be arriving in quest of you if
they are not already here

Then they will join us or wait said Mrs Ashwood incisively with
her first exhibition of the imperiousness of a rich and pretty woman
Perhaps she was a little annoyed that her elaborate introduction of
herself had produced no reciprocal disclosure by her companion Will
you please send the landlord to me she added

John Milton disappeared in the hotel as she cantered to the porch In
another moment she was giving the landlord her orders with the easy
confidence of one who knew herself only as an always welcome and highly
privileged guest which was not without its effect And she added
carelessly when everything is ready you will please tellMr

Harcourt suggested the landlord promptly

Mrs Ashwoods perfectly trained face gave not the slightest sign of the
surprise that had overtaken her Of courseMr Harcourt

You know hes the son of the millionaire continued the landlord not
at all unwilling to display the importance of the habitues of Crystal
Spring though theyve quarreled and dont get on together

I know said the lady languidly and if any one comes here for ME
ask them to wait in the parlor until I come

Then submitting herself and her dusty habit to the awkward ministration
of the Irish chambermaid she was quite thrilled with a delightful
curiosity She vaguely remembered that she had heard something of the
Harcourt family discordbut that was the divorced daughter surely
And this young man was Harcourts son and they had quarreled A quarrel
with a frank open ingenuous fellow like thata mere boycould only
be the fathers fault Luckily she had never mentioned the name of
Harcourt She would not now he need not know that it was his father who
had originated the party why should she make him uncomfortable for the
few moments they were together

There was nothing of this in her face as she descended and joined him
He thought that face handsome wellbred and refined But this
breeding and refinement seemed to himin his ignorance of the world
possiblyas only a graceful concealment of a self of which he knew
nothing and he was not surprised to find that her pretty gray eyes now
no longer hidden by her veil really told him no more than her lips
He was a little afraid of her and now that she had lost her naive
enthusiasm he was conscious of a vague remorsefulness for his
interrupted work in the forest What was he doing here He who had
avoided the cruel selfish world of wealth and pleasurea world that
this woman representedthe world that had stood apart from him in the
one dream of his lifeand had let Loo die His quickly responsive face
darkened

I am afraid I really interrupted you up there she said gently
looking in his face with an expression of unfeigned concern you were
at work of some kind I know and I have very selfishly thought only of
myself But the whole scene was so new to me and I so rarely meet any
one who sees things as I do that I know you will forgive me She bent
her eyes upon him with a certain soft timidity You are an artist

I am afraid not he said coloring and smiling faintly I dont think
I could draw a straight line

Dont try to theyre not pretty and the mere ability to draw them
straight or curved doesnt make an artist But you are a LOVER of
nature I know and from what I have heard you say I believe you can do
what lovers cannot domake others feel as they doand that is what I
call being an artist You write You are a poet

Oh dear no he said with a smile half of relief and half of naive
superiority Im a prose writeron a daily newspaper

To his surprise she was not disconcerted rather a look of animation lit
up her face as she said brightly Oh then you can of course satisfy
my curiosity about something You know the road from San Francisco to
the Cliff House Except for the view of the sealions when one gets
there its stupid my brother says its like all the San Francisco
excursionsa dusty drive with a julep at the end of it Well one day
we were coming back from a drive there and when we were beginning to
wind along the brow of that dreadful staring Lone Mountain Cemetery I
said I would get out and walk and avoid the obtrusive glitter of those
tombstones rising before me all the way I pushed open a little gate and
passed in Once among these funereal shrubs and cold statuesque lilies
everything was changed I saw the staring tombstones no longer for
like them I seemed to be always facing the sea The road had vanished
everything had vanished but the endless waste of ocean below me and
the last slope of rock and sand It seemed to be the fittest place for
a cemeterythis end of the crumbling earththis beginning of the
eternal sea There dont think that idea my own or that I thought of
it then NoI read it all afterwards and thats why Im telling you
this

She could not help smiling at his now attentive face and went on Some
days afterwards I got hold of a newspaper four or six months old and
there was a description of all that I thought I had seen and feltonly
far more beautiful and touching as you shall see for I cut it out
of the paper and have kept it It seemed to me that it must be some
personal experienceas if the writer had followed some dear friend
therealthough it was with the unostentation and indefiniteness of
true and delicate feeling It impressed me so much that I went back
there twice or thrice and always seemed to move to the rhythm of that
beautiful funeral marchand I am afraid being a woman that I wandered
around among the graves as though I could find out who it was that had
been sung so sweetly and if it were man or woman Ive got it here
she said taking a dainty ivory portemonnaie from her pocket and
picking out with two slim fingertips a folded slip of newspaper and
I thought that maybe you might recognize the style of the writer and
perhaps know something of his history For I believe he has one There
that is only a part of the article of course but it is the part that
interested me Just read from there she pointed leaning partly over
his shoulder so that her soft breath stirred his hair to the end it
isnt long

In the film that seemed to come across his eyes suddenly the print
appeared blurred and indistinct But he knew that she had put into his
hand something he had written after the death of his wife something
spontaneous and impulsive when her loss still filled his days and
nights and almost unconsciously swayed his pen He remembered that his
eyes had been as dim when he wrote itand nowhanded to him by this
smiling welltodo woman he was as shocked at first as if he had
suddenly found her reading his private letters This was followed by a
sudden sense of shame that he had ever thus publicly bared his feelings
and then by the illogical but irresistible conviction that it was false
and stupid The few phrases she had pointed out appeared as cheap and
hollow rhetoric amid the surroundings of their social teteatete over
the luncheontable There was small danger that this heady wine of
womans praise would make him betray himself there was no sign of
gratified authorship in his voice as he quietly laid down the paper and
said dryly I am afraid I cant help you You know it may be purely
fanciful

I dont think so said Mrs Ashwood thoughtfully At the same time it
doesnt strike me as a very abiding grief for that very reason Its TOO
sympathetic It strikes me that it might be the first grief of some one
too young to be inured to sorrow or experienced enough to accept it as
the common lot But like all youthful impressions it is very sincere and
true while it lasts I dont know whether one gets anything more real
when one gets older

With an insincerity he could not account for he now felt inclined to
defend his previous sentiment although all the while conscious of a
certain charm in his companions graceful skepticism He had in his
truthfulness and independence hitherto always been quite free from that
feeble admiration of cynicism which attacks the intellectually weak and
immature and his present predilection may have been due more to her
charming personality She was not at all like his sisters she had
none of Clementinas cold abstraction and none of Euphemias sharp
and demonstrative effusiveness And in his secret consciousness of her
flattering foreknowledge of him with her assurance that before they had
ever met he had unwittingly influenced her he began to feel more at his
ease His fair companion also in the equally secret knowledge she had
acquired of his history felt as secure as if she had been formally
introduced Nobody could find fault with her for showing civility to
the ostensible son of her host it was not necessary that she should
be aware of their family differences There was a charm too in their
enforced isolation in what was the exceptional solitude of the little
hotel that day and the seclusion of their table by the window of the
diningroom which gave a charming domesticity to their repast From
time to time they glanced down the lonely canyon losing itself in the
afternoon shadow Nevertheless Mrs Ashwoods preoccupation with Nature
did not preclude a human curiosity to hear something more of John
Miltons quarrel with his father There was certainly nothing of the
prodigal son about him there was no precocious evil knowledge in his
frank eyes no record of excesses in his healthy fresh complexion
no unwholesome or disturbed tastes in what she had seen of his rural
preferences and understanding of natural beauty To have attempted any
direct questioning that would have revealed his name and identity would
have obliged her to speak of herself as his fathers guest She began
indirectly he had said he had been a reporter and he was still a
chronicler of this strange life He had of course heard of many cases
of family feuds and estrangements Her brother had told her of some
dreadful vendettas he had known in the Southwest and how whole families
had been divided Since she had been here she had heard of odd cases of
brothers meeting accidentally after long and unaccounted separations
of husbands suddenly confronted with wives they had deserted of fathers
encountering discarded sons

John Miltons face betrayed no uneasy consciousness If anything it was
beginning to glow with a boyish admiration of the grace and intelligence
of the fair speaker that was perhaps heightened by an assumption of
half coquettish discomfiture

You are laughing at me she said finally But inhuman and selfish as
these stories may seem and sometimes are I believe that these curious
estrangements and separations often come from some fatal weakness of
temperament that might be strengthened or some trivial misunderstanding
that could be explained It is separation that makes them seem
irrevocable only because they are inexplicable and a vague memory
always seems more terrible than a definite one Facts may be forgiven
and forgotten but mysteries haunt one always I believe there are weak
sensitive people who dread to put their wrongs into shape those are the
kind who sulk and when you add separation to sulking reconciliation
becomes impossible I knew a very singular case of that kind once If
you like Ill tell it to you May be you will be able some day to
weave it into one of your writings And its quite true

It is hardly necessary to say that John Milton had not been touched by
any personal significance in his companions speech whatever she may
have intended and it is equally true that whether she had presently
forgotten her purpose or had become suddenly interested in her own
conversation her face grew more animated her manner more confidential
and something of the youthful enthusiasm she had shown in the mountain
seemed to come back to her

I might say it happened anywhere and call the people M or N but it
really did occur in my own family and although I was much younger
at the time it impressed me very strongly My cousin who had been
my playmate was an orphan and had been intrusted to the care of my
father who was his guardian He was always a clever boy but singularly
sensitive and quick to take offense Perhaps it was because the little
property his father had left made him partly dependent on my father and
that I was rich but he seemed to feel the disparity in our positions
I was too young to understand it I think it existed only in his
imagination for I believe we were treated alike But I remember that he
was full of vague threats of running away and going to sea and that
it was part of his weak temperament to terrify me with his extravagant
confidences I was always frightened when after one of those scenes
he would pack his valise or perhaps only tie up a few things in a
handkerchief as in the advertisement pictures of the runaway slaves
and declare that we would never lay eyes upon him again At first I
never saw the ridiculousness of all thisfor I ought to have told you
that he was a rather delicate and timid boy and quite unfitted for a
rough life or any exposurebut others did and one day I laughed at
him and told him he was afraid I shall never forget the expression of
his face and never forgive myself for it He went awaybut he returned
the next day He threatened once to commit suicide left his clothes on
the bank of the river and came home in another suit of clothes he had
taken with him When I was sent abroad to school I lost sight of him
when I returned he was at college apparently unchanged When he
came home for vacation far from having been subdued by contact with
strangers it seemed that his unhappy sensitiveness had been only
intensified by the ridicule of his fellows He had even acquired a
most ridiculous theory about the degrading effects of civilization and
wanted to go back to a state of barbarism He said the wilderness was
the only true home of man My father instead of bearing with what
I believe was his infirmity dryly offered him the means to try his
experiment He started for some place in Texas saying we would never
hear from him again A month after he wrote for more money My father
replied rather impatiently I supposeI never knew exactly what he
wrote That was some years ago He had told the truth at last for we
never heard from him again

It is to be feared that John Milton was following the animated lips and
eyes of the fair speaker rather than her story Perhaps that was the
reason why he said May he not have been a disappointed man

I dont understand she said simply

Perhaps said John Milton with a boyish blush you may have
unconsciously raised hopes in his heartand

I should hardly attempt to interest a chronicler of adventure like you
in such a very commonplace everyday style of romance she said
with a little impatience even if my vanity compelled me to make such
confidences to a stranger Noit was nothing quite as vulgar as that
And she added quickly with a playfully amused smile as she saw the
young fellows evident distress I should have probably heard from him
again Those stories always end in that way

And you thinksaid John Milton

I think said Mrs Ashwood slowly that he actually did commit
suicideor effaced himself in some way just as firmly as I believe he
might have been saved by judicious treatment Otherwise we should have
heard from him Youll say thats only a womans reasoningbut I think
our perceptions are often instinctive and I knew his character

Still following the play of her delicate features into a romance of his
own weaving the imaginative young reporter who had seen so much from
the heights of Russian Hill said earnestly Then I have your permission
to use this material at any future time

Yes said the lady smilingly

And you will not mind if I should take some liberties with the text

I must of course leave something to your artistic taste But you will
let me see it

There were voices outside now breaking the silence of the veranda
They had been so preoccupied as not to notice the arrival of a horseman
Steps came along the passage the landlord returned Mrs Ashwood turned
quickly towards him

Mr Grant of your party maam to fetch you

She saw an unmistakable change in her young friends mobile face I
will be ready in a moment she said to the landlord Then turning
to John Milton the archhypocrite said sweetly My brother must have
known instinctively that I was in good hands as he didnt come But I
am sorry for I should have so liked to introduce him to youalthough
by the way with a bright smile I dont think you have yet told me
your name I know I couldnt have FORGOTTEN it

Harcourt said John Milton with a halfembarrassed laugh

But you must come and see me MrMr Harcourt she said producing
a card from a case already in her fingers at my hotel and let my
brother thank you there for your kindness and gallantry to a stranger I
shall be here a few weeks longer before we go south to look for a place
where my brother can winter DO come and see me although I cannot
introduce you to anything as real and beautiful as what YOU have shown
me today Goodby Mr Harcourt I wont trouble you to come down and
bore yourself with my escorts questions and congratulations

She bent her head and allowed her soft eyes to rest upon his with a
graciousness that was beyond her speech pulled her veil over her eyes
again with a pretty suggestion that she had no further use for them
and taking her ridingskirt lightly in her hand seemed to glide from the
room

On her way to San Mateo where it appeared the disorganized party had
prolonged their visit to accept an invitation to dine with a local
magnate she was pleasantly conversational with the slightly abstracted
Grant She was so sorry to have given them all this trouble and anxiety
Of course she ought to have waited at the fork of the road but she had
never doubted but she could rejoin them presently on the main road She
was glad that Miss Euphemias runaway horse had been stopped without
accident it would have been dreadful if anything had happened to HER
Mr Harcourt seemed so wrapped up in his girls It was a pity they never
had a sonAh Indeed Then there was a son Soand father and son had
quarreled That was so sad And for some trifling cause no doubt

I believe he married the housemaid said Grant grimly Be
carefulAllow me

Its no use said Mrs Ashwood flushing with pink impatience as she
recovered her seat which a sudden bolt of her mustang had imperiled I
really cant make out the tricks of this beast Thank you she added
with a sweet smile but I think I can manage him now I cant see
why he stopped Ill be more careful You were saying the son was
marriedsurely not that boy

Boy echoed Grant Then you know

I mean of course he must be a boythey all grew up hereand it was
only five or six years ago that their parents emigrated she retorted a
little impatiently And what about this creature

Your horse

You know I mean the woman he married Of course she was older than
heand caught him

I think there was a year or two difference said Grant quietly

Yes but your gallantry keeps you from telling the truth which is that
the women in cases of this kind are much older and more experienced

Are they Well perhaps she is NOW She is dead

Mrs Ashwood walked her horse Poor thing she said Then a sudden
idea took possession of her and brought a film to her eyes How long
ago she asked in a low voice

About six or seven months I think I believe there was a baby who died
too

She continued to walk her horse slowly stroking its curved neck I
think its perfectly shameful she said suddenly

Not so bad as that Mrs Ashwood surely The girl may have loved
himand he

You know perfectly what I mean Mr Grant I speak of the conduct of
the mother and father and those two sisters

Grant slightly elevated his eyebrows But you forget Mrs Ashwood It
was young Harcourt and his wifes own act They preferred to take their
own path and keep it

I think said Mrs Ashwood authoritatively that the idea of leaving
those two unfortunate children to suffer and struggle on aloneout
thereon the sand hills of San Franciscowas simply disgraceful

Later that evening she was unreasonably annoyed to find that her
brother Mr John Shipley had taken advantage of the absence of Grant
to pay marked attention to Clementina and had even prevailed upon that
imperious goddess to accompany him after dinner on a moonlight stroll
upon the veranda and terraces of Los Pajaros Nevertheless she seemed to
recover her spirits enough to talk volubly of the beautiful scenery
she had discovered in her late perilous abandonment in the wilds of the
Coast Range to aver her intention to visit it again to speak of it in
a severely practical way as offering a far better site for the cottages
of the young married couples just beginning life than the outskirts of
towns or the bleak sand hills of San Francisco and thence by graceful
degrees into a dissertation upon popular fallacies in regard to hasty
marriages and the mistaken idea of some parents in not accepting the
inevitable and making the best of it She still found time to enter
into an appreciative and exhaustive criticism upon the literature and
journalistic enterprise of the Pacific Coast with the proprietor of the
Pioneer and to cause that gentleman to declare that whatever people
might say about rich and fashionable Eastern women that Mrs Ashwoods
head was about as level as it was pretty

The next morning found her more thoughtful and subdued and when her
brother came upon her sitting on the veranda while the party were
preparing to return she was reading a newspaper slip that she had taken
from her portemonnaie with a face that was partly shadowed

What have you struck there Conny said her brother gayly It looks
too serious for a recipe

Something I should like you to read some time Jack she said lifting
her lashes with a slight timidity if you would take the trouble I
really wonder how it would impress you

Pass it over said Jack Shipley goodhumoredly with his cigar between
his lips Ill take it now

She handed him the slip and turned partly away he took it glanced at
it sideways turned it over and suddenly his look grew concentrated
and he took the cigar from his lips

Well she said playfully turning to him again What do you think of
it

Think of it he said with a rising color I think its infamous Who
did it

She stared at him then glanced quickly at the slip What are you
reading she said

This of course he said impatiently What you gave me But he was
pointing to THE OTHER SIDE of the newspaper slip

She took it from him impatiently and read for the first time the
printing on the reverse side of the article she had treasured so long
It was the concluding paragraph of an apparently larger editorial One
thing is certain that a man in Daniel Harcourts position cannot afford
to pass over in silence accusations like the above that affect not only
his private character but the integrity of his title to the land that
was the foundation of his fortune When trickery sharp practice and
even criminality in the past are more than hinted at they cannot be
met by mere pompous silence or allusions to private position social
prestige or distinguished friends in the present

Mrs Ashwood turned the slip over with scornful impatience a pretty
uplifting of her eyebrows and a slight curl of her lip I suppose none
of those peoples beginnings can bear looking intoand they certainly
should be the last ones to find fault with anybody But good gracious
Jack what has this to do with you

With me said Shipley angrily Why I proposed to Clementina last
night




CHAPER IX


The wayfarers on the Tasajara turnpike whom Mr Daniel Harcourt
passed with his fast trotting mare and sulky saw that their great
fellowtownsman was more than usually preoccupied and curt in his
acknowledgment of their salutations Nevertheless as he drew near
the creek he partly checked his horse and when he reached a slight
acclivity of the interminable plainwhich had really been the bank of
the creek in bygone dayshe pulled up alighted tied his horse to a
rail fence and clambering over the inclosure made his way along the
ridge It was covered with nettles thistles and a few wiry dwarf
larches of native growth dust from the adjacent highway had invaded
it with a few scattered and torn handbills waste paper rags empty
provision cans and other suburban debris Yet it was the site of Lige
Curtiss cabin long since erased and forgotten The bed of the old
creek had receded the last tules had been cleared away the channel and
embarcadero were half a mile from the bank and log whereon the pioneer
of Tasajara had idly sunned himself

Mr Harcourt walked on occasionally turning over the scattered objects
with his foot and stopping at times to examine the ground more closely
It had not apparently been disturbed since he himself six years ago
had razed the wretched shanty and carried off its timbers to aid in the
erection of a larger cabin further inland He raised his eyes to the
prospect before himto the town with its steamboats lying at the
wharves to the grain elevator the warehouses the railroad station
with its puffing engines the flagstaff of Harcourt House and the
clustering roofs of the town and beyond the painted dome of his last
creation the Free Library This was all HIS work HIS planning HIS
foresight whatever they might say of the wandering drunkard from whose
tremulous fingers he had snatched the opportunity They could not take
THAT from him however they might follow him with envy and reviling
any more than they could wrest from him the five years of peaceful
possession It was with something of the prosperous consciousness with
which he had mounted the platform on the opening of the Free Library
that he now climbed into his buggy and drove away

Nevertheless he stopped at his Land Office as he drove into town
and gave a few orders I want a strong picket fence put around the
fiftyvara lot in block fiftyseven and the ground cleared up at once
Let me know when the men get to work and Ill overlook them

Reentering his own house in the square where Mrs Harcourt and
Clementinawho often accompanied him in those business visitswere
waiting for him with luncheon he smiled somewhat superciliously as the
servant informed him that Professor Grant had just arrived Really
that man was trying to make the most of his time with Clementina
Perhaps the rival attractions of that Boston swell Shipley had something
to do with it He must positively talk to Clementina about this In
point of fact he himself was a little disappointed in Grant who since
his offer to take the task of hunting down his calumniators had really
done nothing He turned into his study but was slightly astonished to
find that Grant instead of paying court to Clementina in the adjoining
drawingroom was sitting rather thoughtfully in his own armchair

He rose as Harcourt entered I didnt let them announce me to the
ladies he said as I have some important business with you first and
we may find it necessary that I should take the next train back to town
You remember that a few weeks ago I offered to look into the matter of
those slanders against you I apprehended it would be a trifling matter
of envy or jealousy on the part of your old associates or neighbors
which could be put straight with a little good feeling but I must be
frank with you Harcourt and say at the beginning that it turns out
to be an infernally ugly business Call it conspiracy if you like or
organized hostility Im afraid it will require a lawyer rather than
an arbitrator to manage it and the sooner the better For the most
unpleasant thing about it is that I cant find out exactly HOW BAD it
is

Unfortunately the weaker instinct of Harcourts nature was first roused
the vulgar rage which confounds the bearer of ill news with the
news itself filled his breast And this is all that your confounded
intermeddling came to he said brutally

No said Grant quietly with a preoccupied ignoring of the insult that
was more hopeless for Harcourt I found out that it is claimed that
this Lige Curtis was not drowned nor lost that night but that he
escaped and for three years has convinced another man that you are
wrongfully in possession of this land that these two naturally hold you
in their power and that they are only waiting for you to be forced into
legal proceedings for slander to prove all their charges Until
then for some reason best known to themselves Curtis remains in the
background

Does he deny the deed under which I hold the property said Harcourt
savagely

He says it was only a security for a trifling loan and not an actual
transfer

And dont those fools know that his security could be forfeited

Yes but not in the way it is recorded in the county clerks office
They say that the record shows that there was an interpolation in the
paper he left with youwhich was a forgery Briefly Harcourt you are
accused of that Moreit is intimated that when he fell into the creek
that night and escaped on a raft that was floating past that he had
been first stunned by a blow from some one interested in getting rid of
him

He paused and glanced out of the window

Is that all asked Harcourt in a perfectly quiet steady voice

All replied Grant struck with the change in his companions manner
and turning his eyes upon him quickly

The change indeed was marked and significant Whether from relief at
knowing the worst or whether he was experiencing the same reaction from
the utter falsity of this last accusation that he had felt when Grant
had unintentionally wronged him in his previous recollection certain it
is that some unknown reserve of strength in his own nature of which
he knew nothing before suddenly came to his aid in this extremity It
invested him with an uncouth dignity that for the first time excited
Grants respect

I beg your pardon Grant for the hasty way I spoke to you a moment
ago for I thank you and appreciate thoroughly and sincerely what you
have done You are right it is a matter for fighting and not fussing
over But I must have a head to hit Whose is it

The man who holds himself legally responsible is Fletcherthe
proprietor of the Clarion and a man of property

The Clarion That is the paper which began the attack said
Harcourt

Yes and it is only fair to tell you here that your son threw up his
place on it in consequence of its attack upon you

There was perhaps the slightest possible shrinking in Harcourts
eyelidsthe one congenital likeness to his discarded sonbut his
otherwise calm demeanor did not change Grant went on more cheerfully
Ive told you all I know When I spoke of an unknown WORST I did not
refer to any further accusation but to whatever evidence they might
have fabricated or suborned to prove any one of them It is only the
strength and fairness of the hands they hold that is uncertain
Against that you have your certain uncontested possession the peculiar
character and antecedents of this Lige Curtis which would make his
evidence untrustworthy and even make it difficult for them to establish
his identity I am told that his failure to contest your appropriation
of his property is explained by the fact of his being absent from the
country most of the time but again this would not account for their
silence until within the last six months unless they have been waiting
for further evidence to establish it But even then they must have known
that the time of recovery had passed You are a practical man Harcourt
I neednt tell you therefore what your lawyer will probably tell you
that practically so far as your rights are concerned you remain
as before these calumnies that a cause of action unprosecuted or
in abeyance is practically no cause and that it is not for you to
anticipate one BUT

He paused and looked steadily at Harcourt Harcourt met his look with a
dull oxlike stolidity I shall begin the suit at once he said

And I said Grant holding out his hand will stand by you But tell
me now what you knew of this man Curtishis character and disposition
it may be some clue as to what are his methods and his intentions

Harcourt briefly sketched Lige Curtis as he knew him and understood
him It was another indication of his reserved power that the
description was so singularly clear practical unprejudiced and
impartial that it impressed Grant with its truthfulness

I cant make him out he said you have drawn a weak but neither a
dishonest nor malignant man There must have been somebody behind him
Can you think of any personal enemy

I have been subjected to the usual jealousy and envy of my old
neighbors I suppose but nothing more I have harmed no one knowingly

Grant was silent it had flashed across him that Rice might have
harbored revenge for his fatherinlaws interference in his brief
matrimonial experience He had also suddenly recalled his conversation
with Billings on the day that he first arrived at Tasajara It would not
be strange if this man had some intimation of the secret He would try
to find him that evening He rose

You will stay to dinner My wife and Clementina will expect you

Not tonight I am dining at the hotel said Grant smilingly but I
will come in later in the evening if I may He paused hesitatingly for
a moment Have your wife and daughter ever expressed any opinion on
this matter

No said Harcourt Mrs Harcourt knows nothing of anything that does
not happen IN the house Euphemia knows only the things that happen out
of it where she is visitingand I suppose that young men prefer to
talk to her about other things than the slanders of her father And
Clementinawell you know how calm and superior to these things SHE
is

For that very reason I thought that perhaps she might be able to see
them more clearlybut no matter I dare say you are quite right in
not discussing them at home This was the fact although Grant had not
forgotten that Harcourt had put forward his daughters as a reason for
stopping the scandal some weeks beforea reason which however seemed
never to have been borne out by any apparent sensitiveness of the girls
themselves

When Grant had left Harcourt remained for some moments steadfastly
gazing from the window over the Tasajara plain He had not lost his
look of concentrated power nor his determination to fight A struggle
between himself and the phantoms of the past had become now a necessary
stimulus for its own sakefor the sake of his mental and physical
equipoise He saw before him the pale agitated irresolute features of
Lige Curtisnot the man HE had injured but the man who had injured
HIM whose spirit was aimlessly and wantonlyfor he had never
attempted to get back his possessions in his lifetime nor ever tried
to communicate with the possessorstriking at him in the shadow And
it was THAT man that pale writhing frightened wretch whom he had once
mercifully helped Yes whose LIFE he had even saved that night from
exposure and delirium tremens when he had given him the whiskey And
this life he had saved only to have it set in motion a conspiracy to
ruin him Who knows that Lige had not purposely conceived what they had
believed to be an attempt at suicide only to cast suspicion of murder
on HIM From which it will be perceived that Harcourts powers of moral
reasoning had not improved in five years and that even the impartiality
he had just shown in his description of Lige to Grant had been
swallowed up in this new sense of injury The founder of Tasajara whose
cool business logic unfailing foresight and practical deductions were
never at fault was once more childishly adrift in his moral ethics

And there was Clementina of whose judgment Grant had spoken so
persistentlycould she assist him It was true as he had said he
had never talked to her of his affairs In his sometimes uneasy
consciousness of her superiority he had shrunk from even revealing his
anxieties much less his actual secret and from anything that might
prejudice the lofty paternal attitude he had taken towards his daughters
from the beginning of his good fortune He was never quite sure if her
acceptance of it was real he was never entirely free from a certain
jealousy that always mingled with his pride in her superior rectitude
and yet his feeling was distinct from the goodnatured contempt he
had for his wifes loyalty the anger and suspicion that his sons
opposition had provoked and the halfaffectionate toleration he had
felt for Euphemias waywardness However he would sound Clementina
without betraying himself

He was anticipated by a slight step in the passage and the pushing open
of his study door The tall graceful figure of the girl herself stood
in the opening

They tell me Mr Grant has been here Does he stay to dinner

No he has an engagement at the hotel but he will probably drop in
later Come in Clemmy I want to talk to you Shut the door and sit
down

She slipped in quietly shut the door took a seat on the sofa softly
smoothed down her gown and turned her graceful head and serenely
composed face towards him Sitting thus she looked like some finely
finished painting that decorated rather than belonged to the roomnot
only distinctly alien to the flesh and blood relative before her but
to the house and even the local monotonous landscape beyond the window
with the shining new shingles and chimneys that cut the new blue sky
These singular perfections seemed to increase in Harcourts mind the
exasperating sense of injury inflicted upon him by Liges exposures
With a daughter so incomparably gifteda matchless creation that was
enough in herself to ennoble that fortune which his own skill and genius
had lifted from the muddy tules of Tasajara where this Lige had left
itthat SHE should be subjected to this annoyance seemed an infamy
that Providence could not allow What was his mere venial transgression
to this exaggerated retribution

Clemmy girl Im going to ask you a question Listen pet He had
begun with a reminiscent tenderness of the epoch of her childhood but
meeting the unresponding maturity of her clear eyes he abandoned it
You know Clementina I have never interfered in your affairs nor
tried to influence your friendships for anybody Whatever people may
have to say of me they cant say that Ive always trusted you as I
would myself to choose your own associates I have never regretted it
and I dont regret it now But Id like to knowI have reasons today
for askinghow matters stand between you and Grant

The Parian head of Minerva on the bookcase above her did not offer the
spectator a face less free from maidenly confusion than Clementinas
at that moment Her father had certainly expected none but he was not
prepared for the perfect coolness of her reply

Do you mean have I ACCEPTED him

Nowellyes

No then Is that what he wished to see you about It was understood
that he was not to allude again to the subject to any one

He has not to ME It was only my own idea He had something very
different to tell me You may not know Clementina he begun
cautiously that I have been lately the subject of some anonymous
slanders and Grant has taken the trouble to track them down for me It
is a calumny that goes back as far as Sidon and I may want your level
head and good memory to help me to refute it He then repeated calmly
and clearly with no trace of the fury that had raged within him a
moment before the substance of Grants revelation

The young girl listened without apparent emotion When he had finished
she said quickly And what do you want me to recollect

The hardest part of Harcourts task was coming Well dont you
remember that I told you the day the surveyors went awaythatI had
bought this land of Lige Curtis some time before

Yes I remember your saying so but

But what

I thought you only meant that to satisfy mother

Daniel Harcourt felt the blood settling round his heart but he was
constrained by an irresistible impulse to know the worst Well what
did YOU think it really was

I only thought that Lige Curtis had simply let you have it thats
all

Harcourt breathed again But what for Why should he

WellON MY ACCOUNT

On YOUR account What in Heavens name had YOU to do with it

He loved me There was not the slightest trace of vanity
selfconsciousness or coquetry in her quiet fateful face and for this
very reason Harcourt knew that she was speaking the truth

Loved YOUyou Clementinamy daughter Did he ever TELL you so

Not in words He used to walk up and down on the road when I was at the
back window or in the garden and often hung about the bank of the creek
for hours like some animal I dont think the others saw him and when
they did they thought it was Parmlee for Euphemia Even Euphemia thought
so too and that was why she was so conceited and hard to Parmlee
towards the end She thought it was Parmlee that night when Grant and
Rice came but it was Lige Curtis who had been watching the window
lights in the rain and who must have gone off at last to speak to
you in the store I always let Phemie believe that it was Parmleeit
seemed to please her

There was not the least tone of mischief or superiority or even of
patronage in her manner It was as quiet and cruel as the fate that
might have led Lige to his destruction Even her father felt a slight
thrill of awe as she paused Then he never really spoke to you he
asked hurriedly

Only once I was gathering swamp lilies all alone a mile below the
bend of the creek and he came upon me suddenly Perhaps it was that I
didnt jump or startI didnt see anything to jump or start atthat he
said Youre not frightened at me Miss Harcourt like the other girls
You dont think Im drunk or half madas they do I dont remember
exactly what I said but it meant that whether he was drunk or half mad
or sober I didnt see any reason to be afraid of him And then he told
me that if I was fond of swamp lilies I might have all I wanted at his
place and for the matter of that the place too as he was going away
for he couldnt stand the loneliness any longer He said that he had
nothing in common with the place and the peopleno more than I hadand
that was what he had always fancied in me I told him that if he felt
in that way about his place he ought to leave it or sell it to some one
who cared for it and go away That must have been in his mind when he
offered it to youat least thats what I thought when you told us you
had bought it I didnt know but what he might have told you but you
didnt care to say it before mother

Mr Harcourt sat gazing at her with breathless amazement And
youthink thatLige Curtislovliked you

Yes I think he didand that he does now

NOW What do you mean The man is dead said Harcourt starting

Thats just what I dont believe

Impossible Think of what you are saying

I never could quite understand or feel that he was dead when everybody
said so and now that Ive heard this story I KNOW that he is living

But why did he not make himself known in time to claim the property

Because he did not care for it

What did he care for then

Me I suppose

But this calumny is not like a man who loves you

It is like a JEALOUS one

With an effort Harcourt threw off his bewildered incredulity and grasped
the situation He would have to contend with his enemy in the flesh and
blood but that flesh and blood would be very weak in the hands of the
impassive girl beside him His face lightened

The same idea might have been in Clementinas mind when she spoke again
although her face had remained unchanged I do not see why YOU should
bother yourself further about it she said It is only a matter
between myself and him you can leave it to me

But if you are mistaken and he should not be living

I am not mistaken I am even certain now that I have seen him

Seen him

Yes said the girl with the first trace of animation in her face
It was four or five months ago when we were visiting the Briones at
Monterey We had ridden out to the old Mission by moonlight There were
some Mexicans lounging around the posada and one of them attracted my
attention by the way he seemed to watch me without revealing any more
of his face than I could see between his serape and the black silk
handkerchief that was tied around his head under his sombrero But I
knew he was an Americanand his eyes were familiar I believe it was
he

Why did you not speak of it before

The look of animation died out of the girls face Why should I she
said listlessly I did not know of these reports then He was nothing
more to us You wouldnt have cared to see him again She rose
smoothed out her skirt and stood looking at her father There is one
thing of course that youll do at once

Her voice had changed so oddly that he said quickly Whats that

Call Grant off the scent Hell only frighten or exasperate your game
and thats what you dont want

Her voice was as imperious as it had been previously listless And it
was the first time he had ever known her to use slang

It seemed as startling as if it had fallen from the marble lips above
him

But Ive promised him that we should go together to my lawyer
tomorrow and begin a suit against the proprietors of the Clarion

Do nothing of the kind Get rid of Grants assistance in this matter
and see the Clarion proprietor yourself What sort of a man is he Can
you invite him to your house

I have never seen him I believe he lives at San Jose He is a wealthy
man and a large land owner there You understand that after the first
article appeared in his paper and I knew that he had employed your
brotheralthough Grant says that he had nothing to do with it and left
Fletcher on account of itI could have no intercourse with him Even if
I invited him he would not come

He MUST come Leave it to ME She stopped and resumed her former
impassive manner I had something to say to you too father Mr
Shipley proposed to me the day we went to San Mateo

Her fathers eyes lit with an eager sparkle Well he said quickly

I reminded him that I had known him only a few weeks and that I wanted
time to consider

Consider Why Clemmy hes one of the oldest Boston families rich
from his father and grandfatherrich when I was a shopkeeper and your
mother

I thought you liked Grant she said quietly

Yes but if YOU have no choice nor feeling in the matter why Shipley
is far the better man And if any of the scandal should come to his
ears

So much the better that the hesitation should come from me But if you
think it better I can sit down here and write to him at once declining
the offer She moved towards the desk

No No I did not mean that said Harcourt quickly I only thought
that if he did hear anything it might be said that he had backed out

His sister knows of his offer and though she dont like it nor me she
will not deny the fact By the way you remember when she was lost that
day on the road to San Mateo

Yes

Well she was with your son John Milton all the time and they
lunched together at Crystal Spring It came out quite accidentally
through the hotelkeeper

Harcourts brow darkened Did she know him before

I cant say but she does now

Harcourts face was heavy with distrust Taking Shipleys offer and
these scandals into consideration I dont like the look of this
Clementina

I do said the girl simply

Harcourt gazed at her keenly and with the shadow of distrust still upon
him It seemed to be quite impossible even with what he knew of her
calmly cold nature that she should be equally uninfluenced by Grant or
Shipley Had she some steadfast lofty ideal or perhaps some already
absorbing passion of which he knew nothing She was not a girl to betray
itthey would only know it when it was too late Could it be possible
that there was still something between her and Lige that he knew
nothing of The thought struck a chill to his breast She was walking
towards the door when he recalled himself with an effort

If you think it advisable to see Fletcher you might run down to San
Jose for a day or two with your mother and call on the Ramirez
They may know him or somebody who does Of course if YOU meet him and
casually invite him it would be different

Its a good idea she said quickly Ill do it and speak to mother
now

He was struck by the change in her face and voice they had both
nervously lightened as oddly and distinctly as they had before seemed
to grow suddenly harsh and aggressive She passed out of the room with
girlish brusqueness leaving him alone with a new and vague fear in his
consciousness


A few hours later Clementina was standing before the window of the
drawingroom that overlooked the outskirts of the town The moonlight
was flooding the vast bluish Tasajara levels with a faint lustre as if
the waters of the creek had once more returned to them In the shadow of
the curtain beside her Grant was facing her with anxious eyes

Then I must take this as your final answer Clementina

You must And had I known of these calumnies before had you been frank
with me even the day we went to San Mateo my answer would have been as
final then and you might have been spared any further suspense I am
not blaming you Mr Grant I am willing to believe that you thought
it best to conceal this from meeven at that time when you had just
pledged yourself to find out its truth or falsehoodyet my answer
would have been the same So long as this stain rests on my fathers
name I shall never allow that name to be coupled with yours in marriage
or engagement nor will my pride or yours allow us to carry on a simple
friendship after this I thank you for your offer of assistance but
I cannot even accept that which might to others seem to allow some
contingent claim I would rather believe that when you proposed this
inquiry and my father permitted it you both knew that it put an end to
any other relations between us

But Clementina you are wrong believe me Say that I have been
foolish indiscreet madstill the few who knew that I made these
inquiries on your fathers behalf know nothing of my hopes of YOU

But I do and that is enough for me

Even in the hopeless preoccupation of his passion he suddenly looked
at her with something of his old critical scrutiny But she stood there
calm concentrated selfpossessed and upright Yes it was possible
that the pride of this Southwestern shopkeepers daughter was greater
than his own

Then you banish me Clementina

It is we whom YOU have banished

Goodnight

Goodby

He bent for an instant over her cold hand and then passed out into the
hall She remained listening until the front door closed behind him
Then she ran swiftly through the hall and up the staircase with an
alacrity that seemed impossible to the stately goddess of a moment
before When she had reached her bedroom and closed the door so
exuberant still and so uncontrollable was her levity and action that
without going round the bed which stood before her in the centre of
the room she placed her two hands upon it and lightly vaulted sideways
across it to reach the window There she watched the figure of Grant
crossing the moonlit square Then turning back into the halflit room
she ran to the small dressingglass placed at an angle on a toilet table
against the wall With her palms grasping her knees she stooped
down suddenly and contemplated the mirror It showed what no one but
Clementina had ever seenand she herself only at rare intervalsthe
laughing eyes and soul of a selfsatisfied materialminded ordinary
countrygirl




CHAPER X


But Mr Lawrence Grants character in certain circumstances would seem
to have as startling and inexplicable contradictions as Clementina
Harcourts and three days later he halted his horse at the entrance of
Los Gatos Rancho The Home of the Catsso called from the catamounts
which infested the localitywhich had for over a century lazily basked
before one of the hottest canyons in the Coast Range had lately been
stirred into some activity by the American Don Diego Fletcher who had
bought it put up a sawmill and deforested the canyon Still there
remained enough suggestion of a feline haunt about it to make Grant
feel as if he had tracked hither some stealthy enemy in spite of the
peaceful intimation conveyed by the sign on a rough boarded shed at the
wayside that the Los Gatos Land and Lumber Company held their office
there

A cigarettesmoking peon lounged before the door Yes Don Diego was
there but as he had arrived from Santa Clara only last night and was
going to Colonel Ramirez that afternoon he was engaged Unless the
business was importantbut the cool determined manner of Grant even
more than his words signified that it WAS important and the servant
led the way to Don Diegos presence

There certainly was nothing in the appearance of this sylvan proprietor
and newspaper capitalist to justify Grants suspicion of a surreptitious
foe A handsome man scarcely older than himself in spite of a wavy
mass of perfectly white hair which contrasted singularly with his brown
mustache and dark sunburned face So disguising was the effect of these
contradictions that he not only looked unlike anybody else but even
his nationality seemed to be a matter of doubt Only his eyes light
blue and intelligent which had a singular expression of gentleness and
worry appeared individual to the man His manner was cultivated and
easy He motioned his visitor courteously to a chair

I was referred to you said Grant almost abruptly as the person
responsible for a series of slanderous attacks against Mr Daniel
Harcourt in the Clarion of which paper I believe you are the
proprietor I was told that you declined to give the authority for your
action unless you were forced to by legal proceedings

Fletchers sensitive blue eyes rested upon Grants with an expression
of constrained pain and pity I heard of your inquiries Mr Grant you
were making them on behalf of this Mr Harcourt or Harkutthe made the
distinction with intentional deliberationwith a view I believe to
some arbitration The case was stated to you fairly I think I believe
I have nothing to add to it

That was your answer to the ambassador of Mr Harcourt said Grant
coldly and as such I delivered it to him but I am here today to
speak on my own account

What could be seen of Mr Fletchers lips appeared to curl in an odd
smile Indeed I thought it wasor would beall in the family

Grants face grew more stern and his gray eyes glittered Youll find
my status in this matter so far independent that I dont propose
like Mr Harcourt either to begin a suit or to rest quietly under the
calumny Briefly Mr Fletcher as you or your informant knows I was
the surveyor who revealed to Mr Harcourt the value of the land to which
he claimed a title from your man this Elijah or Lige Curtis as you
call himhe could not resist this imitation of his adversarys
supercilious affectation of precise nomenclatureand it was upon
my representation of its value as an investment that he began the
improvements which have made him wealthy If this title was fraudulently
obtained all the facts pertaining to it are sufficiently related to
connect me with the conspiracy

Are you not a little hasty in your presumption Mr Grant said
Fletcher with unfeigned surprise

That is for ME to judge Mr Fletcher returned Grant haughtily

But the name of Professor Grant is known to all California as beyond
the breath of calumny or suspicion

It is because of that fact that I propose to keep it so

And may I ask in what way you wish me to assist you in so doing

By promptly and publicly retracting in the Clarion every word of this
slander against Harcourt

Fletcher looked steadfastly at the speaker And if I decline

I think you have been long enough in California Mr Fletcher to know
the alternative expected of a gentleman said Grant coldly

Mr Fletcher kept his gentle blue eyesin which surprise still
overbalanced their expression of pained concernon Grants face

But is not this more in the style of Colonel Starbottle than Professor
Grant he asked with a faint smile

Grant rose instantly with a white face You will have a better
opportunity of judging he said when Colonel Starbottle has the honor
of waiting upon you from me Meantime I thank you for reminding me of
the indiscretion into which my folly in still believing that this thing
could be settled amicably has led me

He bowed coldly and withdrew Nevertheless as he mounted his horse
and rode away he felt his cheeks burning Yet he had acted upon calm
consideration he knew that to the ordinary Californian experience there
was nothing quixotic nor exaggerated in the attitude he had taken Men
had quarreled and fought on less grounds he had even half convinced
himself that he HAD been insulted and that his own professional
reputation demanded the withdrawal of the attack on Harcourt on
purely business grounds but he was not satisfied of the personal
responsibility of Fletcher nor of his gratuitous malignity Nor did the
man look like a tool in the hands of some unscrupulous and hidden enemy
However he had played his card If he succeeded only in provoking a
duel with Fletcher he at least would divert the public attention from
Harcourt to himself He knew that his superior position would throw the
lesser victim in the background He would make the sacrifice that was
his duty as a gentleman even if SHE would not care to accept it as an
earnest of his unselfish love

He had reached the point where the mountain track entered the Santa
Clara turnpike when his attention was attracted by a handsome but
oldfashioned carriage drawn by four white mules which passed down the
road before him and turned suddenly off into a private road But it was
not this picturesque gala equipage of some local Spanish grandee that
brought a thrill to his nerves and a flash to his eye it was the
unmistakable tall elegant figure and handsome profile of Clementina
reclining in light gauzy wraps against the back seat It was no fanciful
resemblance the outcome of his reveriethere never was any one like
herit WAS she herself But what was she doing here

A vaquero cantered from the cross road where the dust of the vehicle
still hung Grant hailed him Ah it was a fine carroza de cuatro mulas
that he had just passed Si Senor truly it was of Don Jose Ramirez
who lived just under the hill It was bringing company to the casa

Ramirez That was where Fletcher was going Had Clementina known that
he was one of Fletchers friends Might she not be exposed to
unpleasantness marked coolness or even insult in that unexpected
meeting Ought she not to be warned or prepared for it She had banished
Grant from her presence until this stain was removed from her fathers
name but could she blame him for trying to save her from contact with
her fathers slanderer No He turned his horse abruptly into the cross
road and spurred forward in the direction of the casa

It was quite visible nowa lowwalled quadrangular mass of whitewashed
adobe lying like a drift on the green hillside The carriage and four
had far preceded him and was already half up the winding road towards
the house Later he saw them reach the courtyard and disappear within
He would be quite in time to speak with her before she retired to change
her dress He would simply say that while making a professional visit
to Los Gatos Land Company office he had become aware of Fletchers
connection with it and accidentally of his intended visit to Ramirez
His chance meeting with the carriage on the highway had determined his
course

As he rode into the courtyard he observed that it was also approached
by another road evidently nearer Los Gatos and probably the older
and shorter communication between the two ranchos The fact was
significantly demonstrated a moment later He had given his horse to a
servant sent in his card to Clementina and had dropped listlessly on
one of the benches of the gallery surrounding the patio when a horseman
rode briskly into the opposite gateway and dismounted with a familiar
air A waiting peon who recognized him informed him that the Dona was
engaged with a visitor but that they were both returning to the gallery
for chocolate in a moment The stranger was the man he had left only an
hour beforeDon Diego Fletcher

In an instant the idiotic fatuity of his position struck him fully His
only excuse for following Clementina had been to warn her of the coming
of this man who had just entered and who would now meet her as quickly
as himself For a brief moment the idea of quietly slipping out to the
corral mounting his horse again and flying from the rancho crossed
his mind but the thought that he would be running away from the man he
had just challenged and perhaps some new hostility that had sprung up
in his heart against him compelled him to remain The eyes of both men
met Fletchers in halfwondering annoyance Grants in illconcealed
antagonism What they would have said is not known for at that moment
the voices of Clementina and Mrs Ramirez were heard in the passage and
they both entered the gallery The two men were standing together it
was impossible to see one without the other

And yet Grant whose eyes were instantly directed to Clementina thought
that she had noted neither She remained for an instant standing in the
doorway in the same selfpossessed coldly graceful pose he remembered
she had taken on the platform at Tasajara Her eyelids were slightly
downcast as if she had been arrested by some sudden thought or some shy
maiden sensitiveness in her hesitation Mrs Ramirez passed impatiently
before her

Mother of God said that lively lady regarding the two speechless
men is it an indiscretion we are making hereor are you dumb You
Don Diego are loud enough when you and Don Jose are together at least
introduce your friend

Grant quickly recovered himself I am afraid he said coming forward
unless Miss Harcourt does that I am a mere trespasser in your house
Senora I saw her pass in your carriage a few moments ago and having a
message for her I ventured to follow her here

It is Mr Grant a friend of my fathers said Clementina smiling
with equanimity as if just awakening from a momentary abstraction
yet apparently unconscious of Grants imploring eyes but the other
gentleman I have not the pleasure of knowing

Ah Don Diego Fletcher a countryman of yours and yet I think he knows
you not

Clementinas face betrayed no indication of the presence of her fathers
foe and yet Grant knew that she must have recognized his name as she
looked towards Fletcher with perfect selfpossession He was too much
engaged in watching her to take note of Fletchers manifest disturbance
or the evident effort with which he at last bowed to her That this
unexpected double meeting with the daughter of the man he had wronged
and the man who had espoused the quarrel should be confounding to him
appeared only natural But he was unprepared to understand the feverish
alacrity with which he accepted Dona Marias invitation to chocolate
or the equally animated way in which Clementina threw herself into her
hostesss Spanish levity He knew it was an awkward situation that must
be surmounted without a scene he was quite prepared in the presence of
Clementina to be civil to Fletcher but it was odd that in this feverish
exchange of courtesies and compliments HE Grant should feel the
greater awkwardness and be the most ill at ease He sat down and took
his part in the conversation he let it transpire for Clementinas
benefit that he had been to Los Gatos only on business yet there was
no opportunity for even a significant glance and he had the added
embarrassment of seeing that she exhibited no surprise nor seemed to
attach the least importance to his inopportune visit In a miserable
indecision he allowed himself to be carried away by the highflown
hospitality of his Spanish hostess and consented to stay to an early
dinner It was part of the infelicity of circumstance that the voluble
Dona Mariaelecting him as the distinguished stranger above the
resident Fletchermonopolized him and attached him to her side She
would do the honors of her house she must show him the ruins of the
old Mission beside the corral Don Diego and Clementina would join them
presently in the garden He cast a despairing glance at the placidly
smiling Clementina who was apparently equally indifferent to the
evident constraint and assumed ease of the man beside her and turned
away with Mrs Ramirez

A silence fell upon the gallery so deep that the receding voices and
footsteps of Grant and his hostess in the long passage were distinctly
heard until they reached the end Then Fletcher arose with an
inarticulate exclamation Clementina instantly put her finger to her
lips glanced around the gallery extended her hand to him and saying
Come halfled halfdragged him into the passage To the right
she turned and pushed open the door of a small room that seemed a
combination of boudoir and oratory lit by a French window opening to
the garden and flanked by a large black and white crucifix with a prie
Dieu beneath it Closing the door behind them she turned and faced
her companion But it was no longer the face of the woman who had been
sitting in the gallery it was the face that had looked back at her
from the mirror at Tasajara the night that Grant had left hereager
flushed material with commonplace excitement

Lige Curtis she said

Yes he answered passionately Lige Curtis whom you thought dead
Lige Curtis whom you once pitied condoled with and despised Lige
Curtis whose lands and property have enriched you Lige Curtis who
would have shared it with you freely at the time but whom your father
juggled and defrauded of it Lige Curtis branded by him as a drunken
outcast and suicide Lige Curtis

Hush She clapped her little hand over his mouth with a quick but
awkward schoolgirl gesture inconceivable to any who had known her usual
languid elegance of motion and held it there He struggled angrily
impatiently reproachfully and then with a sudden characteristic
weakness that seemed as much of a revelation as her once hoydenish
manner kissed it when she let it drop Then placing both her hands
still girlishly on her slim waist and curtseying grotesquely before
him she said Lige Curtis Oh yes Lige Curtis who swore to do
everything for me Lige Curtis who promised to give up liquor for
mewho was to leave Tasajara for me Lige Curtis who was to reform
and keep his land as a nestegg for us both in the future and then
who sold itand himselfand meto dad for a glass of whiskey Lige
Curtis who disappeared and then let us think he was dead only that he
might attack us out of the ambush of his grave

Yes but think what I have suffered all these years not for the
cursed landyou know I never cared for thatbut for YOUyou
ClementinaYOU rich admired by every one idolized held far above
meME the forgotten outcast the wretched suicideand yet the man
to whom you had once plighted your troth Which of those greedy
fortunehunters whom my moneymy lifeblood as you might have thought
it wasattracted to you did you care to tell that you had ever slipped
out of the little garden gate at Sidon to meet that outcast Do you
wonder that as the years passed and YOU were happy I did not choose to
be so forgotten Do you wonder that when YOU shut the door on the past
I managed to open it againif only a little waythat its light might
startle you

Yet she did not seem startled or disturbed and remained only looking at
him critically

You say that you have suffered she replied with a smile You dont
look it Your hair is white but it is becoming to you and you are a
handsomer man Lige Curtis than you were when I first met you you are
finer she went on still regarding him stronger and healthier
than you were five years ago you are rich and prosperous you have
everything to make you happy buthere she laughed a little held
out both her hands taking his and holding his arms apart in a rustic
homely fashionbut you are still the same old Lige Curtis It was
like you to go off and hide yourself in that idiotic way it was like
you to let the property slide in that stupid unselfish fashion it was
like you to get real mad and say all those mean silly things to dad
that didnt hurt himin your regular looney style for rich or poor
drunk or sober ragged or elegant plain or handsomeyoure always the
same Lige Curtis

In proportion as that material practical rustic selfwhich nobody
but Lige Curtis had ever seencame back to her so in proportion the
irresolute wavering weak and emotional vagabond of Sidon came out to
meet it He looked at her with a vague smile his five years of childish
resentment albeit carried on the shoulders of a man mentally and
morally her superior melted away He drew her towards him yet at the
same moment a quick suspicion returned

Well and what are you doing here Has this man who has followed you
any right any claim upon you

None but what you in your folly have forced upon him You have made him
fathers ally I dont know why he came here I only know why I didto
find YOU

You suspected then

I KNEW Hush

The returning voices of Grant and of Mrs Ramirez were heard in the
courtyard Clementina made a warning yet girlishly mirthful gesture
again caught his hand drew him quickly to the French window and
slipped through it with him into the garden where they were quickly
lost in the shadows of a ceanothus hedge

They have probably met Don Jose in the orchard and as he and Don Diego
have business together Dona Clementina has without doubt gone to her
room and left them For you are not very entertaining to the ladies
todayyou two caballeros You have much politics together ehor
you have discussed and disagreed eh I will look for the Senorita and
let you go Don Distraido

It is to be feared that Grants apologies and attempts to detain her
were equally feebleas it seemed to him that this was the only chance
he might have of seeing Clementina except in company with Fletcher As
Mrs Ramirez left he lit a cigarette and listlessly walked up and
down the gallery But Clementina did not come neither did his hostess
return A subdued step in the passage raised his hopesit was only
the grizzled major domo to show him his room that he might prepare for
dinner

He followed mechanically down the long passage to a second corridor
There was a chance that he might meet Clementina but he reached his
room without encountering any one It was a large vaulted apartment with
a single window a deep embrasure in the thick wall that seemed to focus
like a telescope some forgotten sequestered part of the leafy garden
While washing his hands gazing absently at the green vignette framed by
the dark opening his attention was drawn to a movement of the foliage
stirred apparently by the rapid passage of two halfhidden figures The
quick flash of a feminine skirt seemed to indicate the coy flight of
some romping maid of the casa and the pursuit and struggle of her
vaquero swain To a despairing lover even the spectacle of innocent
pastoral happiness in others is not apt to be soothing and Grant was
turning impatiently away when he suddenly stopped with a rigid face and
quickly approached the window In her struggles with the unseen Corydon
the clustering leaves seemed to have yielded at the same moment with the
coy Chloris and partingdisclosed a stolen kiss Grants hand lay like
ice against the wall For disengaging Fletchers arm from her waist
and freeing her skirt from the foliage it was the calm passionless
Clementina herself who stepped out and moved pensively towards the
casa




CHAPER XI


Readers of the Clarion will have noticed that allusion has been
frequently made in these columns to certain rumors concerning the early
history of Tasajara which were supposed to affect the pioneer record of
Daniel Harcourt It was deemed by the conductors of this journal to be
only consistent with the fearless and independent duty undertaken by the
Clarion that these rumors should be fully chronicled as part of the
information required by the readers of a firstclass newspaper unbiased
by any consideration of the social position of the parties but simply
as a matter of news For this the Clarion does not deem it necessary
to utter a word of apology But for that editorial comment or attitude
which the proprietors felt was justified by the reliable sources of
their information they now consider it only due in honor to themselves
their readers and Mr Harcourt to fully and freely apologize A patient
and laborious investigation enables them to state that the alleged facts
published by the Clarion and copied by other journals are utterly
unsupported by testimony and the chargesalthough more or less
vaguewhich were based upon them are equally untenable We are now
satisfied that one Elijah Curtis a former pioneer of Tasajara who
disappeared five years ago and was supposed to be drowned has not only
made no claim to the Tasajara property as alleged but has given no
sign of his equally alleged resuscitation and present existence and
that on the minutest investigation there appears nothing either in his
disappearance or the transfer of his property to Daniel Harcourt
that could in any way disturb the uncontested title to Tasajara or the
unimpeachable character of its present owner The whole story now seems
to have been the outcome of one of those stupid rural hoaxes too common
in California


Well said Mrs Ashwood laying aside the Clarion with a skeptical
shrug of her pretty shoulders as she glanced up at her brother I
suppose this means that you are going to propose again to the young
lady

I have said Jack Shipley thats the worst of itand got my answer
before this came out

Jack said Mrs Ashwood thoroughly surprised

Yes You see Conny as I told you three weeks ago she said she wanted
time to considerthat she scarcely knew me and all that Well I
thought it wasnt exactly a gentlemans business to seem to stand off
after that last attack on her father and so last week I went down
to San Jose where she was staying and begged her not to keep me in
suspense And by Jove she froze me with a look and said that with
these aspersions on her fathers character she preferred not to be
under obligations to any one

And you believed her

Oh hang it all Look here ConnyI wish youd just try for once to
find out some good in that family besides what that sentimental
young widower John Milton may have You seem to think because theyve
quarreled with HIM there isnt a virtue left among them

Far from seeming to offer any suggestion of feminine retaliation Mrs
Ashwood smiled sweetly My dear Jack I have no desire to keep you from
trying your luck again with Miss Clementina if thats what you mean
and indeed I shouldnt be surprised if a family who felt a mesalliance
as sensitively as the Harcourts felt that affair of their sons would
be as keenly alive to the advantages of a good match for their daughter
As to young Mr Harcourt he never talked to me of the vices of his
family nor has he lately troubled me much with the presence of his own
virtues I havent heard from him since we came here

I suppose he is satisfied with the government berth you got for him
returned her brother dryly

He was very grateful to Senator Flynn who appreciates his talents
but who offered it to him as a mere question of fitness replied Mrs
Ashwood with great precision of statement But you dont seem to know
he declined it on account of his other work

Preferred his old Bohemian ways eh You cant change those fellows
Conny They cant get over the fascinations of vagabondage Sorry your
ladypatroness scheme didnt work Pity you couldnt have promoted him
in the line of his profession as the Grand Duchess of Girolstein did
Fritz

For Heavens sake Jack go to Clementina You may not be successful
but there at least the perfect gentlemanliness and good taste of your
illustrations will not be thrown away

I think of going to San Francisco tomorrow anyway returned Jack with
affected carelessness Im getting rather bored with this wild seaside
watering place and its glitter of ocean and hopeless background of
mountain Its nothing to me that theres no land nearer than Japan
out there It may be very healthful to the tissues but its weariness
to the spirit and I dont see why we cant wait at San Francisco till
the rains send us further south as well as here

He had walked to the balcony of their sittingroom in the little seaside
hotel where this conversation took place and gazed discontentedly over
the curving bay and sandy shore before him After a slight pause Mrs
Ashwood stepped out beside him

Very likely I may go with you she said with a perceptible tone of
weariness We will see after the post arrives

By the way there is a little package for you in my room that came
this morning I brought it up but forgot to give it to you Youll find
it on my table

Mrs Ashwood abstractedly turned away and entered her brothers room
from the same balcony The forgotten parcel which looked like a roll
of manuscript was lying on his dressingtable She gazed attentively at
the handwriting on the wrapper and then gave a quick glance around her
A sudden and subtle change came over her She neither flushed nor paled
nor did the delicate lines of expression in her face quiver or change
But as she held the parcel in her hand her whole being seemed to undergo
some exquisite suffusion As the medicines which the Arabian physician
had concealed in the hollow handle of the mallet permeated the languid
royal blood of Persia so some volatile balm of youth seemed to flow
in upon her with the contact of that strange missive and transform her
weary spirit

Jack she called in a high clear voice But Jack had already gone
from the balcony when she reached it with an elastic step and a quick
youthful swirl and rustling of her skirt He was lighting his cigar in
the garden

Jack she said leaning half over the railing come back here in an
hour and well talk over that matter of yours again

Jack looked up eagerly and as if he might even come up then but she
added quickly In about an hourI must think it over and withdrew

She reentered the sittingroom shut the door carefully and locked it
half pulled down the blind walking once or twice around the table on
which the parcel lay with one eye on it like a graceful cat Then she
suddenly sat down took it up with a grave practical face examined the
postmark curiously and opened it with severe deliberation It contained
a manuscript and a letter of four closely written pages She glanced at
the manuscript with bright approving eyes ran her fingers through its
leaves and then laid it carefully and somewhat ostentatiously on the
table beside her Then still holding the letter in her hand she rose
and glanced out of the window at her bored brother lounging towards the
beach and at the heaving billows beyond and returned to her seat This
apparently important preliminary concluded she began to read

There were as already stated four blessed pages of it All vital
earnest palpitating with youthful energy preposterous in premises
precipitate in conclusionsyet irresistible and convincing to every
woman in their illogical sincerity There was not a word of love in it
yet every page breathed a wholesome adoration there was not an epithet
or expression that a greater prude than Mrs Ashwood would have objected
to yet every sentence seemed to end in a caress There was not a
line of poetry in it and scarcely a figure or simile and yet it was
poetical Boyishly egotistic as it was in attitude it seemed to be
written less OF himself than TO her in its delicate because unconscious
flattery it made her at once the provocation and excuse And yet so
potent was its individuality that it required no signature No one but
John Milton Harcourt could have written it His personality stood out of
it so strongly that once or twice Mrs Ashwood almost unconsciously
put up her little hand before her face with a half mischievous
halfdeprecating smile as if the big honest eyes of its writer were
upon her

It began by an elaborate apology for declining the appointment offered
him by one of her friends which he was bold enough to think had been
prompted by her kind heart That was like her but yet what she might
do to any one and he preferred to think of her as the sweet and gentle
lady who had recognized his merit without knowing him rather than the
powerful and gracious benefactress who wanted to reward him when she did
know him The crown that she had all unconsciously placed upon his head
that afternoon at the little hotel at Crystal Spring was more to him
than the Senators appointment perhaps he was selfish but he could not
bear that she who had given so much should believe that he could accept
a lesser gift All this and much more Some of it he had wanted to say
to her in San Francisco at times when they had met but he could not
find the words But she had given him the courage to go on and do the
only thing he was fit for and he had resolved to stick to that and
perhaps do something once more that might make him hear again her voice
as he had heard it that day and again see the light that had shone in
her eyes as she sat there and read And this was why he was sending her
a manuscript She might have forgotten that she had told him a strange
story of her cousin who had disappearedwhich she thought he might
at some time work up Here it was Perhaps she might not recognize it
again in the way he had written it here perhaps she did not really
mean it when she had given him permission to use it but he remembered
her truthful eyes and believed herand in any event it was hers to do
with what she liked It had been a great pleasure for him to write it
and think that she would see it it was like seeing her himselfthat
was in HIS BETTER SELFmore worthy the companionship of a beautiful and
noble woman than the poor young man she would have helped This was why
he had not called the week before she went away But for all that she
had made his life less lonely and he should be ever grateful to her He
could never forget how she unconsciously sympathized with him that day
over the loss that had blighted his life foreveryet even then he did
not know that she herself had passed through the same suffering But
just here the stricken widow of thirty after a vain attempt to keep up
the knitted gravity of her eyebrows bowed her dimpling face over
the letter of the blighted widower of twenty and laughed so long and
silently that the tears stood out like dew on her lightbrown eyelashes

But she became presently severe again and finished her reading of the
letter gravely Then she folded it carefully deposited it in a box on
her table which she locked After a few minutes however she unlocked
the box again and transferred the letter to her pocket The serenity
of her features did not relax again although her previous pretty
prepossession of youthful spirit was still indicated in her movements
Going into her bedroom she reappeared in a few minutes with a light
cloak thrown over her shoulders and a whitetrimmed broadbrimmed hat
Then she rolled up the manuscript in a paper and called her French
maid As she stood there awaiting her with the roll in her hand she
might have been some young girl on her way to her music lesson

If my brother returns before I do tell him to wait

Madame is going

Out said Mrs Ashwood blithely and tripped downstairs

She made her way directly to the shore where she remembered there was
a group of rocks affording a shelter from the northwest trade winds
It was reached at low water by a narrow ridge of sand and here she had
often basked in the sun with her book It was here that she now unrolled
John Miltons manuscript and read

It was the story she had told him but interpreted by his poetry and
adorned by his fancy until the facts as she remembered them seemed to
be no longer hers or indeed truths at all She had always believed
her cousins unhappy temperament to have been the result of a moral and
physical idiosyncrasyshe found it here to be the effect of a lifelong
and hopeless passion for herself The ingenious John Milton had given a
poets precocity to the youth whom she had only known as a suspicious
moody boy had idealized him as a sensitive but songless Byron had
given him the added infirmity of pulmonary weakness and a handkerchief
that in moments of great excitement after having been hurriedly pressed
to his pale lips was withdrawn with a crimson stain Opposed to this
interesting figurethe more striking to her as she had been hitherto
haunted by the impression that her cousin during his boyhood had been
subject to facial eruption and boilswas her own equally idealized
self Cruelly kind to her cousin and gentle with his weaknesses while
calmly ignoring their cause leading him unconsciously step by step in
his fatal passion he only became aware by accident that she nourished
an ideal hero in the person of a hard proud middleaged practical
man of the worldher future husband At this picture of the late Mr
Ashwood who had really been an indistinctive social bon vivant his
amiable relict grew somewhat hysterical The discovery of her real
feelings drove the consumptive cousin into a secret selfimposed exile
on the shores of the Pacific where he hoped to find a grave But the
complete and sudden change of life and scene the balm of the wild woods
and the wholesome barbarism of nature wrought a magical change in his
physical health and a philosophical rest in his mind He married the
daughter of an Indian chief Years passed the heroinea rich and
still young and beautiful widowunwittingly sought the same medicinal
solitude Here in the depth of the forest she encountered her former
playmate the passion which he had fondly supposed was dead revived in
her presence and for the first time she learned from his bearded lips
the secret of his passion Alas not SHE alone The contiguous forest
could not be bolted out and the Indian wife heard all Recognizing the
situation with aboriginal directness of purpose she committed suicide
in the fond belief that it would reunite the survivors But in vain the
cousins parted on the spot to meet no more

Even Mrs Ashwoods predilection for the youthful writer could not
overlook the fact that the denouement was by no means novel nor the
situation human but yet it was here that she was most interested and
fascinated The description of the forest was a description of the wood
where she had first met Harcourt the charm of it returned until she
almost seemed to again inhale its balsamic freshness in the pages before
her Now as then her youth came back with the same longing and regret
But more bewildering than all it was herself that moved there painted
with the loving hand of the narrator For the first time she experienced
the delicious flattery of seeing herself as only a lover could see her
The smallest detail of her costume was suggested with an accuracy that
pleasantly thrilled her feminine sense The grace of her figure slowly
moving through the shadow the curves of her arm and the delicacy of her
hand that held the bridle rein the gentle glow of her softly rounded
cheek the sweet mystery of her veiled eyes and forehead and the
escaping gold of her lovely hair beneath her hat were all in turn
masterfully touched or tenderly suggested And when to this was added
the faint perfume of her nearer presencethe scent she always usedthe
delicate revelations of her withdrawn gauntlet the bracelet clasping
her white wrist and at last the thrilling contact of her soft hand on
his armshe put down the manuscript and blushed like a very girl Then
she started

A shoutHIS voice surelyand the sound of oars in their rowlocks

An instant revulsion of feeling overtook her With a quick movement she
instantly hid the manuscript beneath her cloak and stood up erect and
indignant Not twenty yards away apparently advancing from the opposite
shore of the bay was a boat It contained only John Milton resting on
his oars and scanning the group of rocks anxiously His face which was
quite strained with anxiety suddenly flushed when he saw her and then
recognizing the unmistakable significance of her look and attitude
paled once more He bent over his oars again a few strokes brought him
close to the rock

I beg your pardon he said hesitatingly as he turned towards her and
laid aside his oars butI thoughtyou werein danger

She glanced quickly round her She had forgotten the tide The ledge
between her and the shore was already a foot under brown seawater Yet
if she had not thought that it would look ridiculous she would have
leaped down even then and waded ashore

Its nothing she said coldly with the air of one to whom the
situation was an everyday occurrence its only a few steps and a
slight wettingand my brother would have been here in a moment more

John Miltons frank eyes made no secret of his mortification I ought
not to have disturbed you I know he said quickly I had no right
But I was on the other shore opposite and I saw you come down herethat
ishe blushed prodigiouslyI thought it MIGHT BE youand I
venturedI meanwont you let me row you ashore

There seemed to be no reasonable excuse for refusing She slipped
quickly into the boat without waiting for his helping hand avoiding
that contact which only a moment ago she was trying to recall

A few strokes brought them ashore He continued his explanation with the
hopeless frankness and persistency of youth and inexperience I only
came here the day before yesterday I would not have come but Mr
Fletcher who has a cottage on the other shore sent for me to offer
me my old place on the Clarion I had no idea of intruding upon your
privacy by calling here without permission

Mrs Ashwood had resumed her conventional courtesy without however
losing her feminine desire to make her companion pay for the agitation
he had caused her We would have been always pleased to see you she
said vaguely and I hope as you are here now you will come with me to
the hotel My brother

But he still retained his hold of the boatrope without moving and
continued I saw you yesterday through the telescope sitting in your
balcony and later at night I think it was your shadow I saw near the
blue shaded lamp in the sittingroom by the windowI dont mean the
RED LAMP that you have in your own room I watched you until you put out
the blue lamp and lit the red one I tell you thisbecausebecauseI
thought you might be reading a manuscript I sent you At least he
smiled faintly I LIKED to think it so

In her present mood this struck her only as persistent and somewhat
egotistical But she felt herself now on ground where she could deal
firmly with him

Oh yes she said gravely I got it and thank you very much for it I
intended to write to you

Dont he said looking at her fixedly I can see you dont like it

On the contrary she said promptly I think it beautifully written
and very ingenious in plot and situation Of course it isnt the story I
told youI didnt expect that for Im not a genius The man is not at
all like my cousin you know and the womanwell really to tell the
truth SHE is simply inconceivable

You think so he said gravely He had been gazing abstractedly at some
shining brown seaweed in the water and when he raised his eyes to hers
they seemed to have caught its color

Think so Im positive Theres no such a woman she isnt HUMAN But
let us walk to the hotel

Thank you but I must go back now

But at least let my brother thank you for taking his placein rescuing
me It was so thoughtful in you to put off at once when you saw I was
surrounded I might have been in great danger

Please dont make fun of me Mrs Ashwood he said with a faint
return of his boyish smile You know there was no danger I have
only interrupted you in a nap or a reverieand I can see now that you
evidently came here to be alone

Holding the manuscript more closely hidden under the folds of her cloak
she smiled enigmatically I think I DID and it seems that the tide
thought so too and acted upon it But you will come up to the hotel
with me surely

No I am going back now There was a sudden firmness about the young
fellow which she had never before noticed This was evidently the
creature who had married in spite of his family

Wont you come back long enough to take your manuscript I will point
out the part I refer to andwe will talk it over

There is no necessity I wrote to you that you might keep it it is
yours it was written for you and none other It is quite enough for me
to know that you were good enough to read it But will you do one thing
more for me Read it again If you find anything in it the second time
to change your viewsif you find

I will let you know she said quickly I will write to you as I
intended

No I didnt mean that I meant that if you found the woman less
inconceivable and more human dont write to me but put your red lamp
in your window instead of the blue one I will watch for it and see it

I think I will be able to explain myself much better with simple pen
and ink she said dryly and it will be much more useful to you

He lifted his hat gravely shoved off the boat leaped into it and
before she could hold out her hand was twenty feet away She turned and
ran quickly up the rocks When she reached the hotel she could see the
boat already half across the bay

Entering her sittingroom she found that her brother tired of waiting
for her had driven out Taking the hidden manuscript from her cloak
she tossed it with a slight gesture of impatience on the table Then she
summoned the landlord

Is there a town across the bay

No the whole mountainside belongs to Don Diego Fletcher He lives
away back in the coast range at Los Gatos but he has a cottage and mill
on the beach

Don Diego FletcherFletcher Is he a Spaniard then

Half and half I reckon hes from the lower country I believe

Is he here often

Not much he has mills at Los Gatos wheat ranches at Santa Clara and
owns a newspaper in Frisco But hes here now There were lights in his
house last night and his cutter lies off the point

Could you get a small package and note to him

Certainly it is only a row across the bay

Thank you

Without removing her hat and cloak she sat down at the table and began a
letter to Don Diego Fletcher She begged to inclose to him a manuscript
which she was satisfied for the interests of its author was better in
his hands than hers It had been given to her by the author Mr J M
Harcourt whom she understood was engaged on Mr Fletchers paper the
Clarion In fact it had been written at HER suggestion and from an
incident in real life of which she was cognizant She was sorry to say
that on account of some very foolish criticism of her own as to the
FACTS the talented young author had become so dissatisfied with it as
to make it possible that if left to himself this very charming and
beautifully written story would remain unpublished As an admirer of
Mr Harcourts genius and a friend of his family she felt that such an
event would be deplorable and she therefore begged to leave it to
Mr Fletchers delicacy and tact to arrange with the author for its
publication She knew that Mr Fletcher had only to read it to be
convinced of its remarkable literary merit and she again would impress
upon him the fact that her playful and thoughtless criticismwhich was
personal and confidentialwas only based upon the circumstances that
the author had really made a more beautiful and touching story than the
poor facts which she had furnished seemed to warrant She had only
just learned the fortunate circumstance that Mr Fletcher was in the
neighborhood of the hotel where she was staying with her brother

With the same practical businesslike directness but perhaps a certain
unbusinesslike haste superadded she rolled up the manuscript and
dispatched it with the letter

This done however a slight reaction set in and having taken off her
hat and shawl she dropped listlessly on a chair by the window but as
suddenly rose and took a seat in the darker part of the room She felt
that she had done right that highest but most depressing of human
convictions It was entirely for his good There was no reason why his
best interests should suffer for his folly If anybody was to suffer
it was she But what nonsense was she thinking She would write to him
later when she was a little cooleras she had said But then he had
distinctly told her and very rudely too that he didnt want her to
write Wanted her to make SIGNALS to himthe idiot and probably was
even now watching her with a telescope It was really too preposterous

The result was that her brother found her on his return in a somewhat
uncertain mood and as a counselor variable and conflicting in
judgment If this Clementina who seemed to have the family qualities of
obstinacy and audacity really cared for him she certainly wouldnt let
delicacy stand in the way of letting him know itand he was therefore
safe to wait a little A few moments later she languidly declared that
she was afraid that she was no counselor in such matters really she
was getting too old to take any interest in that sort of thing and she
never had been a matchmaker By the way now wasnt it odd that
this neighbor that rich capitalist across the bay should be called
Fletcher and James Fletcher too for Diego meant James in Spanish
Exactly the same name as poor Cousin Jim who disappeared Did he
remember her old playmate Jim But her brother thought something else
was a deuced sight more odd namely that this same Don Diego Fletcher
was said to be very sweet on Clementina now and was always in her
company at the Ramirez And that with this Clarion apology on the top
of it looked infernally queer

Mrs Ashwood felt a sudden consternation Here had sheJacks
sisterjust been taking Jacks probable rival into confidential
correspondence She turned upon Jack sharply

Why didnt you say that before

I did tell you he said gloomily but you didnt listen But what
difference does it make to you now

None whatever said Mrs Ashwood calmly as she walked out of the room

Nevertheless the afternoon passed wearily and her usual ride into the
upland canyon did not reanimate her For reasons known best to herself
she did not take her afterdinner stroll along the shore to watch the
outlying fog At a comparatively early hour while there was still a
roseate glow in the western sky she appeared with grim deliberation
and the blue lampshade in her hand and placed it over the lamp which
she lit and stood on her table beside the window This done she sat down
and began to write with brighteyed but vicious complacency

But you dont want that light AND the window Constance said Jack
wonderingly

Mrs Ashwood could not stand the dreadful twilight

But take away your lamp and youll have light enough from the sunset
responded Jack

That was just what she didnt want The light from the window was that
horrid vulgar red glow which she hated It might be very romantic and
suit lovers like Jack but as SHE had some work to do she wanted the
blue shade of the lamp to correct that dreadful glare




CHAPER XII


John Milton had rowed back without lifting his eyes to Mrs Ashwoods
receding figure He believed that he was right in declining her
invitation although he had a miserable feeling that it entailed seeing
her for the last time With all that he believed was his previous
experience of the affections he was still so untutored as to be
confused as to his reasons for declining or his right to have been
shocked and disappointed at her manner It seemed to him sufficiently
plain that he had offended the most perfect woman he had ever known
without knowing more The feeling he had for her was none the
less powerful because in his great simplicity it was vague and
unformulated And it was a part of this strange simplicity that in his
miserable loneliness his thoughts turned unconsciously to his dead wife
for sympathy and consolation Loo would have understood him

Mr Fletcher who had received him on his arrival with singular
effusiveness and cordiality had put off their final arrangements until
after dinner on account of pressing business It was therefore with
some surprise that an hour before the time he was summoned to Fletchers
room He was still more surprised to find him sitting at his desk from
which a number of business papers and letters had been hurriedly thrust
aside to make way for a manuscript A single glance at it was enough
to show the unhappy John Milton that it was the one he had sent to Mrs
Ashwood The color flashed to his cheek and he felt a mist before his
eyes His employers face on the contrary was quite pale and his
eyes were fixed on Harcourt with a singular intensity His voice too
although under great control was hard and strange

Read that he said handing the young man a letter

The color again streamed into John Miltons face as he recognized the
hand of Mrs Ashwood and remained there while he read it When he put
it down however he raised his frank eyes to Fletchers and said with
a certain dignity and manliness What she says is the truth sir But
it is I alone who am at fault This manuscript is merely MY stupid idea
of a very simple story she was once kind enough to tell me when we were
talking of strange occurrences in real life which she thought I might
some time make use of in my work I tried to embellish it and failed
Thats all I will take it backit was written only for her

There was such an irresistible truthfulness and sincerity in his voice
and manner that any idea of complicity with the sender was dismissed
from Fletchers mind As Harcourt however extended his hand for the
manuscript Fletcher interfered

You forget that you gave it to her and she has sent it to me If I
dont keep it it can be returned to her only Now may I ask who is this
lady who takes such an interest in your literary career Have you known
her long Is she a friend of your family

The slight sneer that accompanied his question restored the natural
color to the young mans face but kindled his eye ominously

No he said briefly I met her accidentally about two months ago and
as accidentally found out that she had taken an interest in one of the
first things I ever wrote for your paper She neither knew you nor me
It was then that she told me this story she did not even then know who
I was though she had met some of my family She was very good and has
generously tried to help me

Fletchers eyes remained fixed upon him

But this tells me only WHAT she is not WHO she is

I am afraid you must inquire of her brother Mr Shipley said
Harcourt curtly

Shipley

Yes he is traveling with her for his health and they are going
south when the rains come They are wealthy Philadelphians I believe
andand she is a widow

Fletcher picked up her note and glanced again at the signature
Constance Ashwood There was a moment of silence when he resumed in
quite a different voice Its odd I never met them nor they me

As he seemed to be waiting for a response John Milton said simply
I suppose its because they have not been here long and are somewhat
reserved

Mr Fletcher laid aside the manuscript and letter and took up his
apparently suspended work

When you see this MrsMrs Ashwood again you might say

I shall not see her again interrupted John Milton hastily

Mr Fletcher shrugged his shoulders Very well he said with a
peculiar smile I will write to her Now Mr Harcourt he continued
with a sudden business brevity if you please well drop this affair
and attend to the matter for which I just summoned you Since yesterday
an important contract for which I have been waiting is concluded and
its performance will take me East at once I have made arrangements that
you will be left in the literary charge of the Clarion It is only a
fitting recompense that the paper owes to you and your fatherto whom
I hope to see you presently reconciled But we wont discuss that now
As my affairs take me back to Los Gatos within half an hour I am sorry
I cannot dispense my hospitality in personbut you will dine and
sleep here tonight Goodby As you go out will you please send up Mr
Jackson to me He nodded briefly seemed to plunge instantly into his
papers again and John Milton was glad to withdraw

The shock he had felt at Mrs Ashwoods frigid disposition of his wishes
and his manuscript had benumbed him to any enjoyment or appreciation of
the change in his fortune He wandered out of the house and descended
to the beach in a dazed bewildered way seeing only the words of her
letter to Fletcher before him and striving to grasp some other meaning
from them than their coldly practical purport Perhaps this was her
cruel revenge for his telling her not to write to him Could she not
have divined it was only his fear of what she might say And now it
was all over She had washed her hands of him with the sending of that
manuscript and letter and he would pass out of her memory as a foolish
conceited ingrateperhaps a figure as wearily irritating and stupid to
her as the cousin she had known He mechanically lifted his eyes to the
distant hotel the glow was still in the western sky but the blue lamp
was already shining in the window His cheek flushed quickly and he
turned away as if she could have seen his face Yesshe despised him
and THAT was his answer

When he returned Mr Fletcher had gone He dragged through a dinner
with Mr Jackson Fletchers secretary and tried to realize his good
fortune in listening to the subordinates congratulations But I
thought said Jackson you had slipped up on your luck today when
the old man sent for you He was quite white and ready to rip out about
something that had just come in I suppose it was one of those anonymous
things against your fatherthe old mans dead set against em now
But John Milton heard him vaguely and presently excused himself for a
row on the moonlit bay

The active exertion with intervals of placid drifting along the
landlocked shore somewhat soothed him The heaving Pacific beyond
was partly hidden in a low creeping fog but the curving bay was softly
radiant The rocks whereon she sat that morning the hotel where she
was now quietly reading were outlined in black and silver In this
dangerous contiguity it seemed to him that her presence returnednot
the woman who had met him so coldly who had penned those lines the
woman from whom he was now parting forever but the blameless ideal he
had worshiped from the first and which he now felt could never pass out
of his life again He recalled their long talks their rarer rides and
walks in the city her quick appreciation and ready sympathy her pretty
curiosity and halfmaternal consideration of his foolish youthful past
even the playful way that she sometimes seemed to make herself younger
as if to better understand him Lingering at times in the shadow of the
headland he fancied he saw the delicate nervous outlines of her face
near his own again the faint shading of her brown lashes the soft
intelligence of her gray eyes Drifting idly in the placid moonlight
pulling feverishly across the swell of the channel or lying on his oars
in the shallows of the rocks but always following the curves of the
bay like a bird circling around a lighthouse it was far in the night
before he at last dragged his boat upon the sand Then he turned to look
once more at her distant window He would be away in the morning and he
should never see it again It was very late but the blue light seemed
to be still burning unalterably and inflexibly

But even as he gazed a change came over it A shadow seemed to pass
before the blind the blue shade was lifted for an instant he could see
the colorless starlike point of the light itself show clearly It was
over now she was putting out the lamp Suddenly he held his breath
A roseate glow gradually suffused the window like a burning blush the
curtain was drawn aside and the red lampshade gleamed out surely and
steadily into the darkness

Transfigured and breathless in the moonlight John Milton gazed on it
It seemed to him the dawn of Love




CHAPER XIII


The winter rains had come But so plenteously and persistently and
with such fateful preparation of circumstance that the long looked for
blessing presently became a wonder an anxiety and at last a slowly
widening terror Before a month had passed every mountain stream and
watercourse surcharged with the melted snows of the Sierras had become
a great tributary every tributary a great river until pouring their
great volume into the engorged channels of the American and Sacramento
rivers they overleaped their banks and became as one vast inland sea
Even to a country already familiar with broad and striking catastrophe
the flood was a phenomenal one For days the sullen overflow lay in the
valley of the Sacramento enormous silent currentlessexcept where
the surplus waters rolled through Carquinez Straits San Francisco Bay
and the Golden Gate and reappeared as the vanished Sacramento River in
an outflowing stream of fresh and turbid water fifty miles at sea

Across the vast inland expanse brooded over by a leaden sky leaden
rain fell dimpling like shot the sluggish pools of the flood a
cloudy chaos of fallen trees drifting barns and outhouses wagons and
agricultural implements moved over the surface of the waters or circled
slowly around the outskirts of forests that stood ankle deep in ooze and
the current which in serried phalanx they resisted still As night fell
these forms became still more vague and chaotic and were interspersed
with the scattered lanterns and flaming torches of reliefboats or
occasionally the high terraced gleaming windows of the great steamboats
feeling their way along the lost channel At times the opening of a
furnacedoor shot broad bars of light across the sluggish stream and
into the branches of dripping and driftencumbered trees at times
the looming smokestacks sent out a pentup breath of sparks that
illuminated the inky chaos for a moment and then fell as black and
dripping rain Or perhaps a hoarse shout from some faintly outlined hulk
on either side brought a quick response from the reliefboats and the
detaching of a canoe with a blazing pineknot in its bow into the outer
darkness

It was late in the afternoon when Lawrence Grant from the deck of one
of the larger tugs sighted what had been once the estuary of Sidon
Creek The leader of a party of scientific observation and relief he
had kept a tireless watch of eighteen hours keenly noticing the work of
devastation the changes in the channel the prospects of abatement and
the danger that still threatened He had passed down the length of the
submerged Sacramento valley through the Straits of Carquinez and was
now steaming along the shores of the upper reaches of San Francisco Bay
Everywhere the same scene of desolationvast stretches of tule land
once broken up by cultivation and dotted with dwellings now clearly
erased on that watery chart long lines of symmetrical perspective
breaking the monotonous level showing orchards buried in the flood
Indian mounds and natural eminences covered with cattle or hastily
erected camps half submerged houses whose solitary chimneys however
still gave signs of an undaunted life within isolated groups of trees
with their lower branches heavy with the unwholesome fruit of the
flood in wisps of hay and straw rakes and pitchforks or pathetically
sheltering some shivering and forgotten household pet But everywhere
the same dull expressionless placid tranquillity of destructiona
horrible leveling of all things in one bland smiling equality of
surface beneath which agony despair and ruin were deeply buried and
forgotten a catastrophe without convulsiona devastation voiceless
passionless and supine

The boat had slowed up before what seemed to be a collection of
disarranged houses with the current flowing between lines that indicated
the existence of thoroughfares and streets Many of the lighter wooden
buildings were huddled together on the street corners with their gables
to the flow some appeared as if they had fallen on their knees and
others lay complacently on their sides like the houses of a childs
toy village An elevator still lifted itself above the other warehouses
from the centre of an enormous square pond once the plaza still arose
a Liberty pole or flagstaff which now supported a swinging lantern
and in the distance appeared the glittering dome of some public
building Grant recognized the scene at once It was all that was left
of the invincible youth of Tasajara

As this was an objective point of the scheme of survey and relief for
the district the boat was made fast to the second story of one of the
warehouses It was now used as a general store and depot and bore a
singular resemblance in its interior to Harcourts grocery at Sidon
This suggestion was the more fatefully indicated by the fact that half
a dozen men were seated around a stove in the centre more or less
given up to a kind of philosophical and lazy enjoyment of their enforced
idleness And when to this was added the more surprising coincidence
that the party consisted of Billings Peters and Wingateformer
residents of Sidon and first citizens of Tasajarathe resemblance was
complete

They were ruinedbut they accepted their common fate with a certain
Indian stoicism and Western sense of humor that for the time lifted
them above the vulgar complacency of their former fortunes There was a
deepseated if coarse and irreverent resignation in their philosophy
At the beginning of the calamity it had been roughly formulated by
Billings in the statement that it wasnt anybodys fault there was
nobody to kill and what couldnt be reached by a Vigilance Committee
there was no use resolootin over When the Reverend Doctor Pilsbury
had suggested an appeal to a Higher Power Peters had replied good
humoredly that a Creator who could fool around with them in that style
was above being interfered with by prayer At first the calamity had
been a thing to fight against then it became a practical joke the
sting of which was lost in the victims power of endurance and assumed
ignorance of its purport There was something almost pathetic in their
attempts to understand its peculiar humor

How about that European trip o yours Peters said Billings
meditatively from the depths of his chair Looks as if those
Crowned Heads over there would have to wait till the water goes down
considerable afore you kin trot out your wife and darters before em

Yes said Peters it rather pints that way and ez far ez I kin see
Mame Billings aint goin to no Saratoga neither this year

Reckon the boys wont hang about old Harcourts Free Library to see
the girls home from lectures and singingclass much this year said
Wingate Wonder if Harcourt ever thought o this the day he opened it
and made that rattlin speech o his about the new property Clark
says everything built on that made ground has got to go after the water
falls Rough on Harcourt after all his other losses eh He oughter
have closed up with that scientific chap Grant and married him to
Clementina while the big boom was on

Hush said Peters indicating Grant who had just entered quietly

Dont mind me gentlemen said Grant stepping towards the group
with a grave but perfectly collected face on the contrary I am very
anxious to hear all the news of Harcourts family I left for New York
before the rainy season and have only just got back

His speech and manner appeared to be so much in keeping with the
prevailing grim philosophy that Billings after a glance at the others
went on Ef you left afore the first rains said he you must have
left only the steamer ahead of Fletcher when he run off with Clementina
Harcourt and you might have come across them on their wedding trip in
New York

Not a muscle of Grants face changed under their eager and cruel
scrutiny No I didnt he returned quietly But why did she run
away Did the father object to Fletcher If I remember rightly he was
rich and a good match

Yes but I reckon the old man hadnt quite got over the Clarion
abuse for all its eating humblepie and taking back its yarns of him
And may be he might have thought the engagement rather sudden They say
that shed only met Fletcher the day afore the engagement

That be dd said Peters knocking the ashes out of his pipe and
startling the lazy resignation of his neighbors by taking his feet from
the stove and sitting upright I tell ye gentlemen Im sick o this
sort o hogwash thats been ladled round to us That gal Clementina
Harcourt and that feller Fletcher had met not only once but MANY times
aforeyes they were old friends if it comes to that a matter of six
years ago

Grants eyes were fixed eagerly on the speaker although the others
scarcely turned their heads

You know gentlemen said Peters I never took stock in this yer
story of the drownin of Lige Curtis Why Well if you wanter knowin
my opinionthere never was any Lige Curtis

Billings lifted his head with difficulty Wingate turned his face to the
speaker

There never was a scrap o paper ever found in his cabin with the
name o Lige Curtis on it there never was any inquiry made for Lige
Curtis there never was any sorrowin friends comin after Lige Curtis
For whyThere never was any Lige Curtis The man who passed himself
off in Sidon under that namewas that man Fletcher Thats how he knew
all about Harcourts title thats how he got his best holt on Harcourt
And he did it all to get Clementina Harcourt whom the old man had
refused to him in Sidon

A grunt of incredulity passed around the circle Such is the fate of
historical innovation Only Grant listened attentively

Ye ought to tell that yarn to John Milton said Wingate ironically
its about in the style o them stories he slings in the Clarion

Hes made a good thing outer that job Wonder what he gets for them
said Peters

It was Billingss time to rise and under the influence of some strong
cynical emotion to even rise to his feet Gets for emGETS for em
Ill tell you WHAT he gets for em It beats this story o Peterssit
beats the flood It beats me Ye know that boy gentlemen ye know how
he uster lie round his fathers store reading flapdoodle stories and
sich Ye remember how I uster try to give him good examples and knock
some sense into him Ye remember how after his fathers good luck
he spiled all his own chances and ran off with his fathers waiter
galall on account o them flapdoodle books he read Ye remember how
he sashayed round newspaper offices in Frisco until he could write a
flapdoodle story himself Ye wanter know what he gets for em Ill tell
you He got an interduction to one of them hightoned highfalutin
donttouchme rich widders from Philadelfythats what he gets for
em He got her dead set on him and his stories thats what he gets for
em He got her to put him up with Fletcher in the Clarionthats
what he gets for em And darn my skinef what they say is true while
we hardworking men are sittin here like drowned ratsthat air John
Milton ez never did a stitch o live work like me yere ez never
did anythin but spin yarns about US ez did WORK is now gittin for

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
