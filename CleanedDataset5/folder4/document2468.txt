Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

REPERTORY OF THE COMEDIE HUMAINE
PART I A  K



TRANSLATORS PREFACE

Work crowned by the French Academy is a significant line borne by
the titlepage of the original edition of Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophes monumental work The motto indicates the high esteem in
which the French authorities hold this very necessary adjunct to the
great Balzacian structure And even without this word of approval the
intelligent reader needs but a glance within the pages of the
Repertory of the Comedie Humaine to convince him at once of its
utility

In brief the purpose of the Repertory is to give in alphabetical
sequence the names of all the characters forming this Balzacian
society together with the salient points in their lives It is of
course well known that Balzac made his characters appear again and
again thus creating out of his distinct novels a miniature world To
cite a case in point Rastignac who comes as near being the hero of
the Comedie as any other single character makes his first
appearance in Father Goriot as a student of law then appearing and
disappearing fitfully in a score of principal novels he is finally
made a minister and peer of France Without the aid of the Repertory
it would be difficult for any save a reader of the entire Comedie to
trace out his career But here it is arranged in temporal sequence
thus giving us a concrete view of the man and his relation to this
society

In reading any separate story when reference is made in passing to a
character the reader will find it helpful and interesting to turn to
the Repertory and find what manner of man it is that is under
advisement A little systematic reading of this nature will speedily
render the reader a confirmed Balzacian

A slight confusion may arise in the use of the Repertory on account
of the subdivision of titles This is the fault neither of Messieurs
Cerfberr and Christophe nor of the translator but of Balzac himself
who was continually changing titles dividing and subdividing stories
and revamping and working other changes in his books Cousin Betty
and Cousin Pons were placed together by him under the general title
of Poor Relations Being separate stories we have retained the
separate titles Similarly the three divisions of Lost Illusions
were never published together until 1843in the first complete
edition of the Comedie before assuming final shape its parts had
received several different titles In the present text the editor has
deemed it best to retain two of the parts under Lost Illusions
while the third which presents a separate Rubempre episode is given
as A Distinguished Provincial at Paris The three parts of The
ThirteenFerragus The Duchess of Langeais and The Girl with
the Golden Eyesare given under the general title The fourth part
of Scenes from a Courtesans Life Vautrins Last Avatar which
until the Edition Definitive had been published separately is here
merged into its final place But the three parts of The Celibates
Pierrette The Vicar of Tours and A Bachelors Establishment
being detached are given separately Other minor instances occur but
should be readily cleared up by reference to the Indices also to the
General Introduction given elsewhere

In the preparation of this English text great care has been exercised
to gain accuracya quality not found in other versions now extant In
one or two instances errors have been discovered in the original
French notably in datesprobably typographical errorswhich have
been corrected by means of footnotes A few unimportant elisions have
been made for the sake of brevity and coherence Many difficulties
confront the translator in the preparation of material of this nature
involving names dates and titles Opportunities are constantly
afforded for error and the work must necessarily be painstaking in
order to be successful We desire here to express appreciation for the
valuable assistance of Mr Norman Hinsdale Pitman

To Balzac more than to any other author a Repertory of characters is
applicable for he it was who not only created an entire human
society but placed therein a multitude of personages so real so
distinct with vitality that biographies of them seem no more than
simple justice We can do no more then than follow the advice of
Balzacto quote again from the original titlepageand give a
parallel to the civil register

INTRODUCTION

Are you a confirmed Balzacianto employ a former expression of
Gautier in Jeune France on the morrow following the appearance of
that mystic Rabelaisian epic The Magic Skin Have you experienced
while reading at school or clandestinely some stray volume of the
Comedie Humaine a sort of exaltation such as no other book had
aroused hitherto and few have caused since Have you dreamed at an
age when one plucks in advance all the fruit from the tree of life
yet in blossomI repeat have you dreamed of being a Daniel dArthez
and of covering yourself with glory by the force of your achievements
in order to be requited some day for all the sufferings of your
povertystricken youth by the sublime Diane Duchesse de
Maufrigneuse Princesse de Cadignan

Or perchance being more ambitious and less literary you have
desired to seelike a second Rastignac the doors of high society
opened to your eager gaze by means of the golden key suspended from
Delphine de Nucingens bracelet

Romancist have you sighed for the angelic tenderness of a Henriette
de Mortsauf and realized in your dreams the innocent emotions excited
by culling nosegays by listening to tales of grief by furtive hand
clasps on the banks of a narrow river blue and placid in a valley
where your friendship flourishes like a fair delicate lily the
ideal the chaste flower

Misanthrope have you caressed the chimera to ward off the dark hours
of advancing age of a friendship equal to that with which the good
Schmucke enveloped even the whims of his poor Pons Have you
appreciated the sovereign power of secret societies and deliberated
with yourself as to which of your acquaintances would be most worthy
to enter The Thirteen In your minds eye has the map of France ever
appeared to be divided into as many provinces as the Comedie Humaine
has stories Has Tours stood for Birotteau La Gamard for the
formidable Abbe Troubert Douai Claes Limoges Madame Graslin
Besancon Savarus and his misguided love Angouleme Rubempre
Sancerre Madame de la Baudraye Alencon that touching artless old
maid to whom her uncle the Abbe de Sponde remarked with gentle
irony You have too much wit You dont need so much to be happy

Oh sorcery of the most wonderful magician of letters the world has
seen since Shakespeare If you have come under the spell of his
enchantments be it only for an hour here is a book that will delight
you a book that would have pleased Balzac himselfBalzac who was
more the victim of his work than his most fanatical readers and whose
dream was to compete with the civil records This volume of nearly six
hundred pages is really the civil record of all the characters in the
Comedie Humaine by which you may locate detail by detail the
smallest adventures of the heroes who pass and repass through the
various novels and by which you can recall at a moments notice the
emotions once awakened by the perusal of such and such a masterpiece
More modestly it is a kind of table of contents of a unique type a
table of living contents

Many Balzacians have dreamed of compiling such a civil record I
myself have known of five or six who attempted this singular task To
cite only two names out of the many the idea of this unusual Vapereau
ran through the head of that keen and delicate critic M Henri
Meilhac and of that detective in continued stories Emile Gaboriau I
believe that I also have among the papers of my eighteenth year some
sheets covered with notes taken with the same intention But the labor
was too exhaustive It demanded an infinite patience combined with an
inextinguishable ardor and enthusiasm The two faithful disciples of
the master who have conjoined their efforts to uprear this monument
could not perhaps have overcome the difficulties of the undertaking if
they had not supported each other bringing to the common work M
Christophe his painstaking method M Cerfberr his accurate memory
his passionate faith in the genius of the great Honore a faith that
carried unshakingly whole mountains of documents

A pleasing chapter of literary gossip might be written about this
collaboration a melancholy chapter since it brings with it the
memory of a charming man who first brought Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophe together and who has since died under mournful
circumstances His name was Albert Allenet and he was chief editor of
a courageous little review La Jeune France which he maintained for
some years with a perseverance worthy of the Man of Business in the
Comedie Humaine I can see him yet a feverish fellow wan and
haggard but with his face always lit up by enthusiasm stopping me in
a theatre lobby to tell me about a plan of M Cerfberrs and almost
immediately we discovered that the same plan had been conceived by M
Christophe The latter had already prepared a cabinet of pigeonholes
arranged and classified by the names of Balzacian characters When two
men encounter in the same enterprise as compilers they will either
hate each other or unite their efforts Thanks to the excellent
Allenet the two confirmed Balzacians took to each other wonderfully

Poor Allenet It was not long afterwards that we accompanied his body
to the grave one gloomy afternoon towards the end of autumnall of
us who had known and loved him He is dead also that other Balzacian
who was so much interested in this work and for whom the Comedie
Humaine was an absorbing thought Honore Granoux He was a merchant
of Marseilles with a wan aspect and already an invalid when I met
him But he became animated when speaking of Balzac and with what a
mysterious conspiratorlike veneration did he pronounce these words
The Vicomtemeaning of course to the thirtythird degree
Balzacolatrites that incomparable bibliophile to whom we owe the
history of the novelists works M de Spoelberch de LovenjoulThe
Vicomte will approveor disapprove That was the unvarying formula
for Granoux who had devoted himself to the enormous task of
collecting all the articles small or great published about Balzac
since his entry as a writer And just see what a fascination this
devil of a manas Theophile Gautier once called himexercises over
his followers I am fully convinced that these little details of
Balzacian mania will cause the reader to smile As for me I have
found them and still find them as natural as Balzacs own remark to
Jules Sandeau who was telling him about a sick sister Let us go
back to reality Who is going to marry Eugenie Grandet

Fascination That is the only word that quite characterizes the sort
of influence wielded by Balzac over those who really enjoy him and it
is not today that the phenomenon began Vallies pointed it out long
ago in an eloquent page of the Refractaires concerning book
victims Saint Beuve who can scarcely be suspected of fondness
towards the editorinchief of the Revue Parisienne tells a story
stranger and more significant than every other At one time an entire
social set in Venice and the most aristocratic decided to give out
among its members different characters drawn from the Comedie
Humaine and some of these roles the critic adds mysteriously were
artistically carried out to the very enda dangerous experiment for
we are well aware that the heroes and heroines of Balzac often skirt
the most treacherous abysses of the social Hell

All this happened about 1840 The present year is 1887 and there
seems no prospect of the sorcery weakening The work to which these
notes serve as an introduction may be taken as proof Indeed somebody
has said that the men of Balzac have appeared as much in literature as
in life especially since the death of the novelist Balzac seems to
have observed the society of his day less than he contributed to form
a new one Such and such personages are truer to life in 1860 than in
1835 When one considers a phenomenon of such range and intensity it
does not suffice to employ words like infatuation fashion mania The
attraction of an author becomes a psychological fact of prime
importance and subject to analysis I think I can see two reasons for
this particular strength of Balzacs genius One dwells in the special
character of his vision the other in the philosophical trend which he
succeeded in giving to all his writing

As to the scope of his vision this Repertory alone will suffice to
show Turn over the leaves at random and estimate the number of
fictitious deeds going to make up these two thousand biographies each
individual each distinct and most of them completethat is to say
taking the character at his birth and leaving him only at his death
Balzac not only knows the date of birth or of death he knows as well
the local coloring of the time and the country and profession to which
the man belongs He is thoroughly conversant with questions of
taxation and income and the agricultural conditions He is not
ignorant of the fact that Grandet cannot make his fortune by the same
methods employed by Gobseck his rival in avarice nor Ferdinand du
Tillet that jackal with the same magnitude of operations worked out
by that elephant of a Nucingen He has outlined and measured the exact
relation of each character to his environment in the same way he has
outlined and measured the bonds uniting the various characters so
well that each individual is defined separately as to his personal and
his social side and in the same manner each family is defined It is
the skeleton of these individuals and of these families that is laid
bare for your contemplation in these notes of Messieurs Cerfberr and
Christophe But this structure of facts dependent one upon another by
a logic equal to that of life itself is the smallest effort of
Balzacs genius Does a birthcertificate a marriagecontract or an
inventory of wealth represent a person Certainly not There is still
lacking for a bone covering the flesh the blood the muscles and
the nerves A glance from Balzac and all these tabulated facts become
imbued with life to this circumstantial view of the conditions of
existence with certain beings is added as full a view of the beings
themselves

And first of all he knows them physiologically The inner workings of
their corporeal mechanism is no mystery for him Whether it is
Birotteaus gout or Mortsaufs nervousness or Fraisiers skin
trouble or the secret reason for Rougets subjugation by Flore or
Louis Lamberts catalepsy he is as conversant with the case as though
he were a physician and he is as well informed also as a confessor
concerning the spiritual mechanism which this animal machine supports
The slightest frailties of conscience are perceptible to him From the
portress Cibot to the Marquise dEspard not one of his women has an
evil thought that he does not fathom With what art comparable to
that of Stendhal or Laclos or the most subtle analysts does he note
in The Secrets of a Princessthe transition from comedy to
sincerity He knows when a sentiment is simple and when it is complex
when the heart is a dupe of the mind and when of the senses And
through it all he hears his characters speak he distinguishes their
voices and we ourselves distinguish them in the dialogue The
growling of Vautrin the hissing of La Gamard the melodious tones of
Madame de Mortsauf still linger in our ears For such intensity of
evocation is as contagious as an enthusiasm or a panic

There is abundant testimony going to show that with Balzac this
evocation is accomplished as in the mystic arts by releasing it so
to speak from the ordinary laws of life Pray note in what terms M
le Docteur Fournier the real mayor of Tours relates incidents of the
novelists method of work according to the report of a servant
employed at the chateau of Sache Sometimes he would shut himself up
in his room and stay there several days Then it was that plunged
into a sort of ecstasy and armed with a crow quill he would write
night and day abstaining from all food and merely contenting himself
with decoctions of coffee which he himself prepared Brochure of M
le Docteur Fournier in regard to the statue of Balzac that statue a
piece of work to which M Henry Renaultanother devotee who had
established Le Balzachad given himself so ardently In this
brochure is found a very curious portrait of Balzac after a sepia by
Louis Boulanger belonging to M le Baron Larrey

In the opening pages of Facino Cane this phenomenon is thus
described With me observation had become intuitive from early youth
It penetrated the soul without neglecting the body or rather it
seized so completely the external details that it went beyond them It
gave me the faculty of living the life of the individual over whom it
obtained control and allowed me to substitute myself for him like the
dervish in Arabian Nights assumed the soul and the body of persons
over whom he pronounced certain words And he adds after describing
how he followed a workman and his wife along the street I could
espouse their very life I felt their rags on my back I trod in their
tattered shoes Their desires their needs all passed into my soul
or my soul passed into them It was the dream of a man awakened One
day while he and a friend of his were watching a beggar pass by the
friend was so astonished to see Balzac touch his own sleeve he seemed
to feel the rent which gaped at the elbow of the beggar

Am I wrong in connecting this sort of imagination with that which one
witnesses in fanatics of religious faith With such a faculty Balzac
could not be like Edgar Poe merely a narrator of nightmares He was
preserved from the fantastic by another gift which seems contradictory
to the first This visionary was in reality a philosopher that is to
say an experimenter and a manipulator of general ideas Proof of this
may be found in his biography which shows him to us during his
college days at Vendome plunged into a whirl of abstract reading The
entire theological and occult library which he discovered in the old
Oratorian institution was absorbed by the child till he had to quit
school sick his brain benumbed by this strange opium The story of
Louis Lambert is a monograph of his own mind During his youth and in
the moments snatched from his profession to what did he turn his
attention Still to general ideas We find him an interested onlooker
at the quarrel of Geoffroy SaintHilaire and Cuvier troubling himself
about the hypothesis of the unity of creation and still dealing with
mysticism and in fact his romances abound in theories There is not
one of his works from which you cannot obtain abstract thoughts by the
hundreds If he describes as in The Vicar of Tours the woes of an
old priest he profits by the opportunity to exploit a theory
concerning the development of sensibility and a treatise on the
future of Catholicism If he describes as in The Firm of Nucingen
a supper given to Parisian blases he introduces a system of credit
reports of the Bank and Bureau of Finance andany number of other
things Speaking of Daniel dArthez that one of his heroes who with
Albert Savarus and Raphael most nearly resembles himself he writes
Daniel would not admit the existence of talent without profound
metaphysical knowledge At this moment he was in the act of despoiling
both ancient and modern philosophy of all their wealth in order to
assimilate it He desired like Moliere to become a profound
philosopher first of all a writer of comedies afterwards Some
readers there are indeed who think that philosophy superabounds with
Balzac that the surplus of general hypotheses overflows at times and
that the novels are too prone to digressions Be that as it may it
seems incontestible that this was his master faculty the virtue and
vice of his thought Let us see however by what singular detour this
power of generalizationthe antithesis one might say of the
creative powerincreased in him the faculty of the poetic visionary

It is important first of all to note that this power of the
visionary could not be put directly into play Balzac had not long
enough to live The list of his works year by year prepared by his
sister shows that from the moment he achieved his reputation till the
day of his death he never took time for rest or observation or the
study of mankind by daily and close contact like Moliere or Saint
Simon He cut his life in two writing by night sleeping by day and
after sparing not a single hour for calling promenades or sentiment
Indeed he would not admit this troublesome factor of sentiment
except at a distance and through lettersbecause it forms ones
style At any rate that is the kind of love he most willingly
admittedunless an exception be made of the mysterious intimacies of
which his correspondence has left traces During his youth he had
followed this same habit of heavy labor and as a result the
experience of this master of exact literature was reduced to a
minimum but this minimum sufficed for him precisely because of the
philosophical insight which he possessed to so high a degree To this
meagre number of positive faculties furnished by observation he
applied an analysis so intuitive that he discovered behind the small
facts amassed by him in no unusual quantity the profound forces the
generative influences so to speak

He himself describesonce more in connection with Daniel dArthez
the method pursued in this analytical and generalizing work He calls
it a retrospective penetration Probably he lays hold of the
elements of experience and casts them into a seeming retort of
reveries Thanks to an alchemy somewhat analogous to that of Cuvier
he was enabled to reconstruct an entire temperament from the smallest
detail and an entire class from a single individual but that which
guided him in his work of reconstruction was always and everywhere the
habitual process of philosophers the quest and investigation of
causes

It is due to this analysis that this dreamer has defined almost all
the great principles of the psychological changes incident to our
time He saw clearly while democracy was establishing itself with us
on the ruins of the ancient regime the novelty of the sentiments
which these transfers from class to class were certain to produce He
fathomed every complication of heart and mind in the modern woman by
an intuition of the laws which control her development He divined the
transformation in the lives of artists keeping pace with the change
in the national situation and to this day the picture he has drawn of
journalism in Lost Illusions A Distinguished Provincial at Paris
remains strictly true It seems to me that this same power of locating
causes which has brought about such a wealth of ideas in his work
has also brought about the magic of it all While other novelists
describe humanity from the outside he has shown man to us both from
within and without The characters which crowd forth from his brain
are sustained and impelled by the same social waves which sustain and
impel us The generative facts which created them are the same which
are always in operation about us If many young men have taken as a
model a Rastignac for instance it is because the passions by which
this ambitious pauper was consumed are the same which our age of
unbridled greed multiplies around disinherited youth Add to this that
Balzac was not content merely to display the fruitful sources of a
modern intellect but that he cast upon them the glare of the most
ardent imagination the world has ever known By a rare combination
this philosopher was also a man like the storytellers of the Orient
to whom solitude and the overexcitement of nightwork had
communicated a brilliant and unbroken hallucination He was able to
impart this fever to his readers and to plunge them into a sort of
Arabian Nights country where all the passions all the desires of
real life appear but expanded to the point of fantasy like the
dreams brought on by laudanum or hasheesh Why then should we not
understand the reason that for certain readers this world of
Balzacs is more real than the actual world and that they devoted
their energies to imitating it

It is possible that today the phenomenon is becoming rarer and that
Balzac while no less admired does not exercise the same fascinating
influence The cause for this is that the great social forces which he
defined have almost ended their work Other forces now shape the
oncoming generations and prepare them for further sensitive
influences It is none the less a fact that to penetrate the central
portions of the nineteenth century in France one must read and reread
the Comedie Humaine And we owe sincere thanks to Messieurs Cerfberr
and Christophe for this Repertory Thanks to them we shall the more
easily traverse the long galleries painted and frescoed of this
enormous palacea palace still unfinished inasmuch as it lacks
those Scenes of Military Life whose titles awaken dreams within us
Forced Marches The Battle of Austerlitz After Dresden
Incontestably Tolstoys War and Peace is an admirable book but how
can we help regretting the loss of the painting of the Grand Army and

in 1792 Her father M de Chatillonest advised her against but gave
her in marriage to her cousin the attractive Colonel Victor
dAiglemont in 1813 Quickly disillusioned and attacked from another
source by an inflammation very often fatal and which is spoken of by
women only in confidence she sank into a profound melancholy The
death of the Comtesse de ListomereLandon her aunt by marriage
deprived her of valuable protection and advice Shortly thereafter she
became a mother and found in the realization of her new duties
strength to resist the mutual attachment between herself and the young
and romantic Englishman Lord Arthur Ormond Grenville a student of
medicine who had nursed her and healed her bodily ailments and who
died rather than compromise her Heartbroken the marquise withdrew
to the solitude of an old chateau situated between Moret and Montereau
in the midst of a neglected waste She remained a recluse for almost a
year given over utterly to her grief refusing the consolations of
the Church offered her by the old cure of the village of SaintLange
Then she reentered society at Paris There at the age of about
thirty she yielded to the genuine passion of the Marquis de
Vandenesse A child christened Charles was born of this union but
he perished at an early age under very tragic circumstances Two other
children Moina and Abel were also the result of this love union
They were favored by their mother above the two eldest children
Helene and Gustave the only ones really belonging to the Marquis

having none of her children remaining alive save her daughter Moina
sacrificed all her own fortune for a dower in order to marry the
latter to M de SaintHereen heir of one of the most famous families
of France She then went to live with her soninlaw in a magnificent
mansion overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides But her daughter gave
her slight return for her love Ruffled one day by some remarks made
to her by Madame dAiglemont concerning the suspicious devotion of the
Marquis de Vandenesse Moina went so far as to fling back at her
mother the remembrance of the latters own guilty relations with the
young mans father Terribly overcome by this attack the poor woman
who was a physical wreck deaf and subject to heart disease died in
1844 A Woman of Thirty

AIGLEMONT Helene d eldest daughter of the Marquis and Marquise

paroxysm of ferocious hate she pushed her brother Charles into the
Bievre where he was drowned This childish crime always passed for a
terrible accident When a young womanone Christmas nightHelene
eloped with a mysterious adventurer who was being tracked by justice
and who was for the time being in hiding at the home of the Marquis
Victor dAiglemont at Versailles Her despairing father sought her
vainly He saw her no more till seven years later and then only once
when on his return from America to France The ship on which he
returned was captured by pirates whose captain The Parisian the
veritable abductor of Helene protected the marquis and his fortune
The two lovers had four beautiful children and lived together in the
most perfect happiness sharing the same perils Helene refused to
follow her father In 1835 some months after the death of her

daughter Helene who had just escaped shipwreck saving only one
child Both presently succumbed before the eyes of Madame dAiglemont

of a gloomy melodrama at the Gaite theatre He was obliged to flee

two or three years earlier Gustave dAiglemont is next found in the

A Picard gentleman In 1821 when about twentyfive he was poverty
stricken and dwelt on the fifth floor of a dismal house in the rue des
QuatreVents Paris where had also resided the illustrious surgeon
Desplein in his youth There he fraternized with Horace Bianchon
then housephysician at HotelDieu Leon Giraud the profound
philosopher Joseph Bridau the painter who later achieved so much
renown Fulgence Ridal comic poet of great sprightliness Meyraux
the eminent physiologist who died young lastly Louis Lambert and
Michel Chrestien the Federalist Republican both of whom were cut off
in their prime To these men of heart and of talent Lucien de
Rubempre the poet sought to attach himself He was introduced by
Daniel dArthez their recognized leader This society had taken the
name of the Cenacle DArthez and his friends advised and aided
when in need Lucien the Distinguished Provincial at Paris who ended
so tragically Moreover with a truly remarkable disinterestedness
dArthez corrected and revised The Archer of Charles IX written by
Lucien and the work became a superb book in his hands Another
glimpse of dArthez is as the unselfish friend of Marie Gaston a
young poet of his stamp but effeminate DArthez was swarthy with
long locks rather small and bearing some resemblance to Bonaparte He
might be called the rival of Rousseau the Aquatic since he was
very temperate very pure and drank water only For a long time he
ate at Flicoteauxs in the Latin Quarter He had grown famous in 1832
besides enjoying an income of thirty thousand francs bequeathed by an
uncle who had left him a prey to the most biting poverty so long as
the author was unknown DArthez then resided in a pretty house of his
own in the rue de Bellefond where he lived in other respects as
formerly in the rigor of work He was a deputy sitting on the right
and upholding the Royalist platform of Divine Right When he had
acquired a competence he had a most vulgar and incomprehensible
liaison with a woman tolerably pretty but belonging to a lower
society and without either education or breeding DArthez maintained
her nevertheless carefully concealing her from sight but far from
being a pleasurable manner of life it became odious to him It was at
this time that he was invited to the home of Diane de Maufrigneuse
Princesse de Cadignan who was then thirtysix but did not look it
The famous great coquette told him her socalled secrets
offered herself outright to this man whom she treated as a famous
simpleton and whom she made her lover After that day there was no

the Albret house The device of the dEspards was Des partem
leonis The Negrepelisses were militant Catholics ruined at the time
of the Church wars and afterwards considerably enriched by the
despoiling of a family of Protestant merchants the Jeanrenauds whose
head had been hanged after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes This
property so badly acquired became wondrously profitable to the
NegrepelissesdEspards Thanks to his fortune the grandfather of the
marquis was enabled to wed a NavarreinsLansac an extremely wealthy
heiress her father was of the younger branch of the Grandlieus In
1812 the Marquis dEspard married Mlle de BlamontChauvry then
sixteen years of age He had two sons by her but discord soon arose

borrow He left her in 1816 going with his two children to live on
rue de la MontagneSainteGenevieve Here he devoted himself to the
education of his boys and to the composition of a great work The
Picturesque History of China the profits of which combined with the
savings resultant from an austere manner of living allowed him to pay
in twelve years time to the legatees of the suppliant Jeanrenauds
eleven hundred thousand francs representing the valuetime of Louis

written so to speak in collaboration with Abbe Crozier and its
financial results aided greatly in comforting the declining years of a

guardian appointed for her husband by ridiculing the noble conduct of
the marquis But the defendant won his rights at court The

to serve the Bourbons after the first abdication and he gave such

on halfpay with the rank of colonel About 1806 he married one of the

His Breton stubbornness led him successively to the studios of Servin
Schinner and Sommervieux He afterwards studied but fruitlessly the
works of Granet and Drolling then he completed his art studies with
DuvalLecamus Grassou profited nothing by his work with these
masters nor did his acquaintance with Lora or Joseph Bridau assist

faculty and the skill in execution For this reason Grassou usually
called Fougeres by his comrades obtained their warm support and
