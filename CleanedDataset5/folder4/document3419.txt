The Hundred and Oneth



Rebecca Mary took another stitch Then another Ninetysevvun
ninetyeight she counted aloud her little pointed face gravely
intent She waited the briefest possible space before she took
ninetynine It was getting very close to the Time now At the hundred
an oneth Rebecca Mary whispered Its almost it Her breath came
quicker under her tight little dress Between her thin light eyebrows a
crease deepened anxiously

Ninetynine she counted one hunderedit was so very close
now The next stitch would be the hundred and oneth Rebecca Marys face
suddenly grew quite white

Ill wait a mminute she decided Im just a little scared When
youve been lookin head to the hundred and oneth so LONG and you get
the very next door to it it scares you a little Ill wait untiloh
until Thomas Jefferson crows before I sew the hundred and oneth

Thomas Jefferson was prospecting under the currant bushes Rebecca Mary
could see him distinctly even with her nearsighted little eyes for
Thomas Jefferson was snowwhite Once in a while he stalked dignifiedly
out of the bushes and crowed He might do it again any minute now

The great sheet billowed and floated round Rebecca Mary scarcely whiter
than her face She held her needle poised waiting the signal of Thomas
Jefferson At any minute He was coming out now A fleck of
snowwhite was pricking the green of the currant leaves

Hes out Any minute hell begin to cr He was already beginning The
warning signals were outchest expanding neck elongating and great
white wing aflap

Im just a little scared breathed the child in the foam of the sheet
Then Thomas Jefferson crowed

Hundred and one Rebecca Mary cried out clearly courage born within
her at the crucial instant The Timethe Timehad come She had taken
her last stitch

Its over she panted It always was acoming and its come I knew
it would When its come you dont feel quite so scared Im glad its
over

She folded up the great sheet carefully making all the edges meet with
painful precision It took time She had left the needle sticking in the
unfinished seamin the hundredandoneth stitchand close beside it
was a tiny dot of red to keep the place

Rebecca Rebecca Mary Aunt Olivia always called like that If there
had been still another nameRebecca Mary Something Elseshe would have
called Rebecca Rebecca Mary Rebecca Mary Something Else

Yesm Im here

Wheres here sharply

HEREthe grapearbor I mean

Have you got your sheet

Iyesm

Is your stent most done

Rebecca Mary rose slowly to her reluctant little feet and with the
heavy sheet across her arm went to meet the sharp voice At last the
Time had come

Well Aunt Olivia was waiting for her answer Rebecca Mary groaned
Aunt Olivia would not think it was well

Well Rebecca Mary Plummer you came to fetch my answer did you You
got your stent most done Aunt Olivias hands were extended for the
folded sheet

Ive got it DONE Aunt Livia answered little Rebecca Mary steadily
Her slender figure in its quaint scant dress looked braced as if to
meet a shock But Rebecca Mary was terribly afraid

Every mite o that seam Then I guess you cant have done it very well
thats what I guess If it aint done well youll have to take it

Waitplease wont you wait Aunt Livia Ive got to say something
I mean Ive got all the overnovering Im ever going to do done
THATS whats done The hundredandoneth stitch was my stent and its
done Im not ever going to take the hundred and twoth Ive decided

Understanding filtered drop by drop into Aunt Olivias bewildered brain
She gasped at the final drop

Not ever going to take another stitch she repeated with a calmness
that was awfuler than storm

Nom

Youve decided

Yesm

May I ask when thisthis state of mind began

Rebecca Mary girded herself afresh She had such need of recruiting
strength

Its been coming on she said Ive felt it I knew all the time it
was acomingand then it came

It seemed to be all there Why must she say any more But still Aunt
Olivia waited and Rebecca Mary read grim displeasure in capitals across
the gray field of her face The little figure stiffened more and more

Ive overnovered leven sheets the steady little voice went on
because Aunt Olivia was waiting and it must and you said I did em
pretty well I tried to I was going to do the other one well till you
said there was going to be another dozen I couldnt BEAR another dozen
Aunt Olivia so I decided to stop When Thomas Jefferson crowed I sewed
the hundredandoneth stitch Thats all theres ever agoing to be

Rebecca Mary stepped back a step or two as if finishing a speech and
retiring from her audience There was even the effect of a bow in the
sudden collapse of the stiff little body It was Aunt Olivias turn now
to respondand Aunt Olivia responded

Youve had your say now Ill have mine Listen to me Rebecca Mary
Plummer Heres this sheet and heres this needle in it When you get
good and ready you can go on sewing You wont have anything to eat till
you do Ive got through

The grim figure swept rightabout face and tramped into the house as
though to the battleroll of drums Rebecca Mary stayed behind face to
face with her fate

Shes a Plummer so itll be SO Rebecca Mary thought with the dull
little thud of a weight falling into her heart Rebecca Mary was a
Plummer too but she did not think of that unless the unswerving
determination in her stout little heart was the unconscious recognition
of it

I wonderher gaze wandered out towards the currantbushes and came
to rest absently on Thomas Jeffersons big white bulkI wonder if it
hurts very much She meant to starve A long vista of foodless days
opened before her and in their contemplation the weight in her heart
grew very heavy indeed

We were GOING to have layercake for supper Im VERY fond of
layercake Rebecca Mary sighed I suppose though after a few
weeksshe shudderedI shall be glad to have ANYTHINGjust common
things like crackers and skimmilk Perhaps I shall want to eat
ahorse Ive heard of folksYou get very unparticular when youre
starving

It was five oclock They WERE going to have supper at half past She
could hear the tea things clinking in the house She stole up to a
window There was Aunt Olivia setting the layercake on the table It
looked plump and rich and it was sugared on top

Theres strawberry jam in between it mused Rebecca Mary regretfully
I wish it was apple jelly I could bear it better if it was apple
jelly But it was jam And there was honey too to eat with Aunt
Olivias little fluffy biscuits How very fond Rebecca Mary was of
honey

Aunt Olivia stood in the kitchen doorway and rang the supper bell in
long steady clangs just as usual But no one responded just as usual
and by the token she knew Rebecca Mary had not taken the other stitch
that lay between her and supper

Shes a Plummer sighed Aunt Olivia inwardly unrealizing her own
Plummership as little Rebecca Mary had unrealized hers Each recognized
only the others The pity that both must be Plummers

Rebecca Mary stayed out of doors until bedtime She made but one
confidant

Ive done it Thomas Jefferson she said sadly You ought to be
sorry for me because if you hadnt crowed I shouldnt have sewed the
hundred and oneth But youre not really to BLAME she added hastily
mindful of Thomas Jeffersons feelings I should have done it sometime
if you hadnt crowed I knew it was coming I suppose now I shall have
to starve Youd think it was pretty hard to starve I guess Thomas
Jefferson

Thomas Jefferson made certain gloomy responses in his throat to the
effect that he was always starving that any contributions on the
spot in the way of corn kernels wheat grains anglewormsany
little delicacies of the kindwould be welcome And Rebecca Mary
understanding led the way to the corn bin In the dark hours that
followed the intimacy between the great white rooster and the little
white girl took on tenderer tones

At breakfast next morningat dinner timeat supperRebecca Mary
absented herself from the house Aunt Olivia set on the meals regularly
and waited with tightening heartstrings It did not seem to occur to her
to eat her own portions She tasted no morsel of all the dainties she
got together wistfully At nightfall the second day she began to feel
real alarm She put on her bonnet and went to the ministers He was
rather a new minister and the Plummers had always required a good deal
of time to make acquaintance But in the present stress of her need Aunt
Olivia did not stop to think of that

You must come over andand do something she said at the conclusion
of her strange little story It seems to me its time for the minister
to step in

What can I do Miss Plummer the embarrassed young man ejaculated
with a feeling of helplessness

Talk to her groaned Aunt Olivia in her agony Tell her what her
duty is Rebecca Mary might listen to the minister All shes got to do
is to take just one stitch to show her submission It wont take but an
instant Ive got supper all out on the kitchen tableI dont care if
its ten oclock at night

It isnt a case for the minister Its a case for the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children fumed the ministers kind little
wife inwardly And she stole away in the twilight to deal with little
Rebecca Mary herself She came back to the minister by and by redeyed
and fierce

You neednt go over Ive been It wont do any good Robert That
poor stiffwilled set little thing is starving by inches

I think her aunt is too

Well perhapsI cant help it Robert perhaps theauntoughtto

My dearFelicia

I told you I couldnt help it She is so hungry Robert If you had
seen herWhat do you think she was doing when I got there

Crying

Crying She was laughing _I_ cried She sat there under some
grapevines watching a great white rooster eat his supper His name I
think is Thomas Jefferson

Yes Thomas Jefferson agreed the minister with the assurance of
acquaintance For Thomas Jefferson was one of his parishioners

Well she was laughing at him in the shakiest hungriest little voice
you ever heard Is it good she says It LOOKS good He was eating
raw corn If I could Id eat supper with you when youre VERY hungry
you dont mind eating things raw Then she saw me

Well

Well I coaxed her Robert It didnt do any good Tomorrow somebody
must go there and interfere

She must be a remarkably strange child the minister mused He was
thinking of the holdingout powers of the three children he had a
halfownership in

I dont think Rebecca Mary IS a child Robert She must be fifty years
old at the least She and her aunt are about the same age Perhaps if
her mother had lived or she hadnt made so many sheets or learned to
knit and darn and cook The ministers kind little wife finished out
her sentence with a sigh She took up a little garment in dire straits
to be mended It suggested things to the minister

Can Rhoda darn

RHODA

Or make sheets and bread and things

Robert dont you feel well Where is the pain But the laugh in the
pleasant blue eyes died out suddenly Little Rebecca Mary lay too heavy
on the ministers wifes heart for mirth

Aunt Olivia went into Rebecca Marys room in the middle of the night
She had been in three times before

She looks thinner than she did last time Aunt Olivia murmured
distressedly Tomorrow nighthow long do children live without eating
Its four meals nowfour meals is a great many for a little thin thing
to go without Aunt Olivia had been without four meals too she would
have been able to judge how it feltif she had remembered that part
She stood in her scant long nightgown gazing down at the little
sleeper The veil was down and her heart was in her eyes

Rebecca Mary threw out her arm and sighed It LOOKS good Thomas
Jefferson she murmured When youre VERY hungry you can eat things
raw Suddenly the child sat up in bed wideeyed and wild She did not
seem to see Aunt Olivia at all

Once I ate a pie she cried It wasnt a whole one but I should eat
a whole one nowI think I should eat the PLATE now She swayed back
and forth weakly awake and not awake

Once I ate a layercake There was jam in it I wouldnt care if it
was apple jelly in it nowId LIKE apple jelly in it now Once I ate
a pudding and a doughnut andaaI think it was a horse Id eat
a horse now Hush Dont tell Aunt Olivia but Im going to
eattoeatThomasJeffer She swayed back on the pillows again
Aunt Olivia shook her in an agony of fearshe was so whiteshe lay so
still

Rebecca Rebecca Mary Rebecca Mary PLUMMER Aunt Olivia shrilled in
her ear You get right out o bed this minute and come downstairs and
eat your supper Its high time you had something in your stomachI
dont care if its twelve oclock You get right out o bed REBECCA
MARY

Aunt Olivia had the limp little figure in her arms shaking it gently
again and again Rebeccas startled eyes flew open In that instant was
born inspiration in the brain of Aunt Olivia She thought of an appeal
to make

Do you want ME to starve too Right here before your face and eyes I
havent eat a mouthful since you did and I shant till you DO

Rebecca Mary slid to the floor with a soft thud of little brown bare
feet Slow comprehension dawned in her eyes Are your did you say
YOU was starving too

Yesgrimly

Does it hurt youtoo

Yesunsteadily

VERY much

YES

Why dont you eat something

Because you dont Im waiting for you to

Shant you ever

Not if you dont

Rebecca Mary caught her breath in a sob Shall I beto blame She was
moving towards the door now With an irresistible impulse Aunt Olivia
gathered her in her arms and covered her lean little face with kisses

You poor little thing You poor little thing You poor little thing
over and over

Rebecca Mary gazed up into the softened face and read something there
It took her breath away She could not believe it without further proof

You dontI dont suppose you LOVE me panted Rebecca Mary But Aunt
Olivia was gone out of the room in a swirl of white nightgown

Everythings on the table she called back from the stairs Im going
to light a fire You come right down I think its high time her
voice trailing out thinly

She does murmured Rebecca Mary radiant of face

At half past twelve oclock they both ate supper both in their scant
white nightgowns both very hungry indeed But before she sat down in
her old place at the table Rebecca Mary went round to Aunt Olivias
place and whispered something rather shyly in her ear She had been by
herself in a corner of the room for a moment

Ive sewed the hundred and twoth Rebecca Mary whispered




The Thousand Quilt


Good afternoon Rebecca Mary said politely

The ministers wife was cutting little trousers out of big onesthe
ministers big ones It was the old puzzle of how to steer clear of the
thin places

Boys grow so sighed tenderly the ministers wife over her work
She had not heard the voice from the doorway

Good afternoonagain

It was a quaint little figure in tight red calico standing there
It might easily have stepped down from some old picture on the wall
Rebecca Mary had a bundle in her arms It was so large that it obscured
breast and face and only a pair of grave blue eyes presided over by
thin light brows seemed visible to the ministers wife The trousers
puzzle merged into this one Now who could

Oh Oh its Miss Plummers little girl Rebecca she said cordially

Rebecca Mary her NIECE came a little muffled from behind the great
bundle

Rebecca Marys niece Oh you mean Miss Plummers niece and your
whole name is that But I suppose she calls you Rebecca or Becky for
short Walk in Rebecca

But Rebecca Mary was struggling with the paralyzing vision of Aunt
Olivia calling her Becky She had passed by the lesser wonder of being
called Rebecca without the Mary

Oh nom indeed Aunt Livia never shortens me gently gasped the
child And the ministers wife measuring from the bundle down smiled
to herself There did not seem much room for shortening

But walk in dearyoure going to walk in I hope you have come to
make me a little call

Rebecca Mary struggled out of her paralysis Here was occasion for new
embarrassment For Rebecca Mary was honest

Nom I mean not a LITTLE call Ive come to spend the afternoon she
said slowly and Ive brought my work

The bundlethe great bundlewas her work She advanced into the room
and began carefully to unroll it It was the turn of the ministers wife
to be paralyzed She pushed forward a chair and the child sat down in
it

Its my Thousand Quilt that Im making for Aunt Livia explained
Rebecca Mary Its most done Theres a thousand pieces in it and Im
on the nine hundred and ninetyoneth I thought proberly youd have some
work so I brought mine

Yes I see The ministers wife stood looking down at the tight
little red figure among the gorgeous waves of the Thousand Quilt They
eddied and surged around it in dizzy reds and purples and greens She
was conscious of being a little seasick and for relief she turned back
to the puzzle of the little trousers It had been in her mind at first
to express sorrow at Rhodas being unfortunately awayand the boys Now
she was glad she hadnt for it was quite plain enough that the visitor
had not come to spend the afternoon with the ministers children but
with the ministers wife

It isnt she thats youngits I thought the ministers wife with
kind laughing eyes Shes old enough to be my mother How old are
you dear she added aloud

Me I guess you mean Aunt Livia dont you Its Aunt Livias
birthday Im making it for its going to be a present Once she gave me
a present on my birthday

Oncethe ministers wife remembered Rhodas birthdays and the boys
Taken altogether such a host of little birthdays But this little old
old visitor seemed to have had but one

My birthday is two days quicker than Aunt Livias is volunteered
the visitor sociably Were most twins you see Aunt Livia
was fiftysix that time she gave me the present Shes agoing to be
fiftynine when I give her this quiltits taken me ever since to make
it

The ministers wife looked up from her cutting So Rebecca Mary was only
fiftynine

Its quite a long quilt sighed Rebecca Mary But pride woke in her
eyes as she gazed out on the splendors of the green and purple sea
A Thousand Quilt has so many stitches in it but when you sewem all
yourselfwhen you sew every single stitch The pride in Rebecca
Marys grave blue eyes grew and grew

Robert the ministers wife said that night to the minister its an
awful quilt but you ought to have seen her eyes Its taken her three
years to make itmaybe you wouldnt be proud yourself

Maybe YOU wouldnt if Rhoda had made it

RHODA Robert she sewed one square of patchwork once and it made
her sick I had to put her to bed Speaking of once reminds meonce
Rebecca Mary had a birthday present Robert She waited a little
anxiously for him to understand The minister always understood but
sometimes he made her wait

Felicia are you trying to make me cry he said and she was
satisfied She went across to him as she always did when she wanted
to cry herself The floor was strewn with the tiniest boys engine and
cars and she remembered as she zigzagged among them that they had
been one of his very last birthday presents

It wasRobert what do you think the present was Ill give you three
guesses but I advise you to guess a rooster

Thomas Jefferson murmured the minister as one who was acquainted

Yes that is his name How did you remember She is very fond of
himhe is her intimatest friend she says So she is under great
obligations to her aunt Its a large quilt but its none too large to
cover Thomas Jefferson Im going to help her buy a lining and cotton
batting

Cracked corn will make a good lining but cotton bat

Robert this is not a comedy If youd seen Rebecca Mary and the
quilt youd call it a tragedy You couldnt surprise me any if you told
me shed quilted it herself

Down the road from Aunt Olivias farm across its southern boundary
fence romped and shouted all day long the Tony Trumbullses No one
except possibly their mother was quite certain how many of them there
were it was a dizzy process to take their census They were never
still in little brown bare limbs nor shrill voices From sunup to
sundown the Tony Trumbullses raced and laughed Certainly they were
happy

The ministers wife had not dared to tell her Caller of the afternoon
that the ministers children were down there shouting and racing with
the little Tony Trumbullses Dear nonot after Rebecca Mary in the
course of conversation had said that Aunt Olivia did not countenance the
Tony Trumbullses Rebecca Mary did not say countenance but it meant
that

Her aunt wont let her play with them Robert And shed like toyou
neednt tell me Rebecca Mary wouldnt like to I saw it in her poor
little solemn eyes Besides she said she asked her aunt once to
let her Robert aunts are cruel I never knew it before Theyve no
business bringing up little Rebecca Marys

My dear Felicia But in the ministers eyes was agreement

Aunt Olivia took afternoon naps with punctilious regularityAunt Olivia
herself was punctilious regularity At half past one day upon day
she hung out the dish towel hung up her kitchen apron and walked with
unswerving course into her bedroom There disposed upon the dainty bed
in rigid lines of unrest she rested The naps were often long ones

A little after the afternoon that Rebecca Mary spent at the ministers
the birthday quilt was finished The thousandth tiny piece was neatly
overnovered to its gorgeous expanse But Rebecca Mary was not
content She longed to make it complete She wanted to surprise Aunt
Livia with it as Aunt Livia on that momentous birthday of her own had
surprised her with the little fluffball of yellow down that had grown
into Thomas Jefferson That had been such a beautiful surprise but
thisAunt Livia had seen the quilt so many many times She had taught
Rebecca Marys stiff little fingers to set the first stitches in it she
had made her rip out this purple square and that pinkchecked one and
this one and that one and that Oh Aunt Livia was ACQUAINTED with the
quilt It would not be much of a surprise

But Rebecca Mary set her little pointed chin between her little brown
palms and pondered and out of the pondering grew a plan so ambitious
and so daring that Rebecca Mary gasped in the throes of it But she
held her ground and entertained it intrepidly She even grew on friendly
terms with it in the end Here was a way to surprise Aunt Livia
Rebecca Mary would do it That it would entail an almost endless amount
of work did not daunt her Rebecca Mary was a Plummer and Plummers were
not to be daunted The long vista of patient hours of trying labor that
the plan opened up before her set her blood tingling like a warriors on
the eve of battle What were long patient hours to a Plummer Rebecca
Mary girded up her loins and went to meet them

Thereafter at Aunt Olivias nap times Rebecca Mary disappeared Day
upon day week upon week she stole quietly away when the door of Aunt
Olivias bedroom shut The first time she went oddly loaded down with
what would have appearedif there had been any one for it to appear
to be a bundle of long sticks She made two trips into the unknown that
first day The second time the bundle looked much like that one over
which her grave blue eyes had peered at the ministers wife when she
went to spend the afternoon with her

It was spring when the mysterious disappearances began It was summer
before Aunt Olivia woke upnot from her nap but from her inattention
Quite suddenly she came upon the realization that Rebecca Mary was
not about the house nor about the grounds for she instituted prompt
search She went to all the childs odd little hauntsthe grapery
the orchard the cornhouse even to her own beloved back yard full of
sweetscented hidingnooks dear to a child but sacred ground to Aunt
Olivia Rebecca Mary sometimes did her stents there as a special
privilege she might be there now unprivileged Aunt Olivias back yard
was almost as full of flowery delights to Rebecca Mary as it was to Aunt
Olivia

The child was not therenot anywhere Aunt Olivia sought for Thomas
Jefferson to inquire of him but Thomas Jefferson was missing too She
went the rounds again Where could the child be

It was a hot stinging day in late June when Aunt Olivias suspicions
awoke They had been long in rousing but once alert they developed
rapidly into certainties Her pale eyes glistened her thin nostrils
dilatedAunt Olivias whole lean sharp unemotional person put on
suspicion The child had gone to see the Tony Trumbullses

My land ejaculated Aunt Olivia after all my forbidding And she a
Plummer She sat down suddenly as though a little faint She had never
known a Plummer to disobey before it was a new experience It took time
to get used to it and she sat still a long time rigid and grim on the
edge of the chair Then as suddenly as she had sat down she got up It
could not beshe refused to entertain the suspicion longer Rebecca
Mary had NOT gone there to that forbidden place she was in the garden
somewhere Aunt Olivia a little stiff as if from a chill went once
more in search of the child

Rebecca Rebecca Mary she called at regular intervals Then sharply
Rebecca Mary Plummer Her voice had thin cadences of suspicion lurking
in it against its will

But there seemed really no doubt One by one incriminating
circumstances occurred to Aunt Olivia Rebecca Mary had longed to go so
much the Tony Trumbullses one at a time or in a tumultuous body had
urged her so often she herself had more than once caught the child
gazing wistfully in passing by at the bewildering deafening frolics
of the little Tony Trumbullses Once Rebecca Mary had asked to go
barefoot as they went Once she had let out the tight little braids
in her neck and rumpled her thin little hair Once Aunt Olivia had come
upon her PLAYING The remembrance of it now tightened the lines around
Aunt Olivias lips The child had been running wildly about the yard
shouting in a strange excited ridiculous way When Aunt Olivia in
stern displeasure had demanded explanations she had run on recklessly
calling back over her shoulder Dont stop me Im a Tony Trumbull

My land breathed Aunt Olivia taking back the suspicion to her
breast After all my forbidding shes gone down there Shes BEEN going
down there dear knows how long Shes waited till I took my naps an
then went A PLUMMER

There was really nowhere else she could have gone She had never wanted
to go anywhere else except to the ministers and Rebecca Mary was
punctilious and would not think of going THERE again till the ministers
wife had returned her visit

But Aunt Olivia waited As usual she went to her room next day at nap
time and closed the door behind her But when a little figure slipped
down the road towards the forbidden place a moment later she was
watching behind her blinds She was groaning as if in pain

The little figure began to run staidly Aunt Olivia groaned again The
child was in a hurry to get thereshe couldnt wait to walk There was
guilt in every motion of the little figure

And she runs like a Plummer groaned Aunt Olivia

The next day and the next Aunt Olivia watched behind her blinds The
fourth day she put on her afternoon dress and followed the hurrying
little figure Not at onceAunt Olivia did not hurry There was a sad
reluctance in every movement It seemed a terrible thing to be following
Rebecca MaryRebecca Mary Plummer to a forbidden place

Afar off Aunt Olivia heard faintly the shoutings that always heralded an
approach to the Tony Trumbullses and shuddered The tumult kept growing
clearer she thought she detected a wild excited little shout that
might be Rebecca Marys Her thin lips set into a stern straight line

A splash of red caught Aunt Olivias eye as she drew nearer the joyous
whirl of little children Rebecca Mary wore a little tight red dress
The coil seemed closing in about the child

Close to the southern boundary fence of Aunt Olivias land stood an
old empty barn It had been a place for storing surplus hay once when
there had been surplus hay For many years now it had been empty As
Aunt Olivia approached it she noticed that its great sliding door was
open Strange when for so long it had been shut

If that old barn door aint open breathed Aunt Olivia stopping in
her astonishment I aint seen it open before in these ten years Now
what I want to know is who opened it Likely as not those screeching
little wild Injuns She strode across the stubby grassground to the
barn and peered into its cool dim depths Then Aunt Olivia uttered
a little bewildered cry Gradually the dimness took on light and the
whole startling picture within unfolded itself to her astonished eyes

Rebecca Mary was quilting She was stooping earnestly over a gay expanse
of purples and reds and greens Her little tight red back was towards
Aunt Olivia it looked bent and strained Rebecca Marys eyes were very
close to the gay expanse

Suddenly Rebecca Mary began to speak and Aunt Olivias widened eyes
discovered a great white rooster pecking about under the quilt His
big snowy bulk stood out distinct in the shadow of it

Im glad were most through Arent you Thomas Jefferson Its been a
pretty LONG quilt You get sort of tired when you quilt a LONG quilt It
makes your back creak when you unbend it and when you quilt in a barn
of course you cant see without squinching and it hurts your eyes to
squinch

Silence again except for the industrious peckpeck of the great white
rooster Aunt Olivia stood very still

Youve been a great help Thomas Jefferson began again the voice of
Rebecca Mary after a little Im very much obliged to you as Ive
said before I dont know what I should have done without you No you
neednt answer I couldnt hear a word you said You cant hear with
cotton in both o your ears Rebecca Mary sighed There was no cotton
in Aunt Olivias ears to shut out the soft little sound But of course
you have to wear it in on account o your conscience Its conscience
cotton Thomas Jefferson Ive explained before but I dont knows you
understood It seems a little unpolite to wear it in my ears with you
here keeping me compny I spose you think its ununsociable But
Aunt Olivia doesnt allow me to sociate with the Tony Trumbullses Oh
Thomas Jefferson I wish shed allow me to sociate

Aunt Olivia found herself wishing she had conscience cotton in both o
her ears

Theyre such nice cheerful little children It makes you want to
go right over their fence and hollow too Rebecca Mary pronounced
it hollow with careful precision Aunt Olivia would not approve
of holler And when you cant you like to listen But I sposed
listening to them hollow would be sociating So I put the cotton in

The joyous hollowing broke in waves of glee on Aunt Olivias eardrums
It seemed to be assaulting her heart Oddly now it did not sound
unmannerly and dreadful It sounded nice and cheerful A Plummer even
might be happy like that

Cotton is a very strange exexperence Thomas Jefferson ran on the
little voice At first you most cant stand it but you get over the
worst of it bymeby Besides were getting most through now Aint that
splendid Thomas Jefferson And its pretty lucky too because Aunt
Livias birthday is getting very near Itit almost scares me Doesnt
it you For I dont know how Aunt Livia looks when shes pleasedyou
think shell look pleased dont you Thomas Jefferson Its such a long
quilt and when youve sewed every stitch yourself

If Rebecca Mary had turned round then she would have seen how Aunt
Olivia looked when she was pleased But the little figure at the
quiltingframe bent steadily to its task only another soft sigh
stealing into Aunt Olivias uncottoned ears Thomas Jefferson pecked
his way towards the open door and the lean figure there started back
guiltily Aunt Olivia did not want to be recognized

You there under the quilt Thomas Jefferson The little voice put on
tenderness Because Im agoing to tell you something Once Aunt Livia
gave ME a birthday present and it was YOU Such a little mite of a
yellow chicken Thats why Im making the quilt for Aunt Livia It was
three years ago Ive loved you ever since added Rebecca Mary simply

For an instant Aunt Olivia stopped being a Plummer A sob crept into
her throat Rebecca Rebecca Mary Rebecca Mary Plummer she cried
involuntarily Then she stepped back hastily glad for the cotton in
Rebecca Marys ears For the surpriseshe must not spoil the childs
hardearned surprise And besides Aunt Olivia wanted to be surprised

It was a relief to get away She could not look any longer at the
picture in the great cobwebby barnthe gorgeous quilt spread out to
its full extent the empty scaffolds above Rebecca Mary stooping to her
work Thomas Jefferson pecking about the floor Aunt Olivia was not old
through all the years ahead of her she would remember that picture

She went straight to the southern boundary fence and looked across
at the jubilant little Tony Trumbullses The one in a red dress like
Rebecca Marys she singled out with a pointing finger YOU come here
she called I wont hurt you no need to look scairt Do you know who I
am Im Rebecca Marys aunt You know who Rebecca Mary is dont you

Gracious shrilled the little red Tony Trumbull which Aunt Olivia
took for yes

Well then you know where I live You see hereI want you all the
whole kit o you to come to my house tomorrow morning to see Rebecca
Mary Im going to say it over again Tomorrow morning to see Rebecca
Mary setting apart the syllables with the pointing finger You can
play in my back yard said Aunt Olivia sublimely unconscious of slang




The Bible Dream



Rebecca Mary sat on the kitchen steps shelling peas and trying not
to listen She had begun a hummy little tune to help out but in the
interstices of rattling peas and the verses of the tune she could
distinctly hear some of the things Aunt Olivia and the Caller were
saying This was one of the things

Shes offered a reward but _I_ dont calculate theres much chance
shell ever see it again

A sigh followed The voice was the Callers the sigh Aunt Olivias

Its queer where it ever went to Aunt Olivias voice

Yes its all o QUEER the Callers with mysterious hints in it that
made Rebecca Mary out on the doorsteps shudder suddenly and forget
where she was in the tune Oh oh dear did they sposethey couldnt
spose it had been STOLEN

Rebecca Marys little hard brown hand stopped halfway to the peabasket
and fell limply at her side on the doorstep It made a little thud as
it fell Rebecca Marys horrified gaze wandered out into the glare of
sunshine where wandered Thomas Jefferson stepping daintily hunting
bugs That was his days work Thomas Jefferson was a hard worker

The voices went on but Rebecca Mary did not heed them now she was
looking at Thomas Jefferson but she did not see him Not untilit
happened On a sudden Thomas Jefferson forgetful of dignity made a
swoop for something that glittered in the grass Then Rebecca Mary saw
himthen started to her feet with an inarticulate little cry while
in her honest brown eyes the horror grew Oh oh dear what was that
Thomas Jefferson had swooped for For a brief instant it had glittered
in the grassRebecca Mary knew in her soul that it had glittered

Thomas Jefferson stretched his sheeny neck curved it ridiculously and
crowed It sounded like a crow of triumph that was the way he crowed
when the bug had been a delicious one

The Caller was coming out Aunt Olivia with her Rebecca Mary could hear
the crackle of their starched skirts Aunt Olivias crackled loudest
Rebecca Mary had always had a queer feeling that Aunt Olivia herself was
starched There had never been a time when she could not remember her
carrying her head very stiffly and straight and never bending her back
Nobody else in the world Rebecca Mary reflected proudly could pick
up a pin without bending SHE couldnt herself even after she had
privately practiced a good deal

Good afternoon Rebecca Mary you out here the Caller nodded
pleasantly Folks had such queer ways of saying things How could you
say good afternoon to anybody if she WASNT here

Didnt you hear Mrs Dixey Rebecca Mary I guess youve forgot your
manners came in Aunt Olivias crisp tones

Oh yesm I have I mean I DID Yesm thank you Im out here
quavered Rebecca Mary She was not afraid of the Caller and she had
never been afraid of Aunt Olivia but the horror that was settling round
her heart made her clear little voice unsteady Her eyes were still
following Thomas Jefferson on his mincing travels about the yard The
sunshine was on his splendid white coat but Rebecca Mary felt no pride
in him

Aint that the hansomest rooster You ought to show him at the fair I
declare See how his feathers glisten in the sun

Thomas Jefferson belongs to Rebecca Mary Aunt Olivia said briefly
She raised him

My Well hes hansome enough Aint it amusing how a nicefeeling
rooster like that will go stepping round as if he felt about too toppy
to live Hed ought to wear diamonds

Oh oh dear please dont breathed Rebecca Mary softly but neither
of the women heard her

Well well I must be going Ive made a regular visit But I tell John
when I get away from home it feels so good I STAY I dont get away
any too often I says and I guess Ive earnt the right Well I must
be going if Im ever going to Goodbye Miss Plummergoodbye Rebecca
Mary All is I hope Mis Averys boarderll find her diamond dont
you But I dont calculate she will Well good afternoon She hadnt
ought to have wore the ring when she knew it was loose in the setting
like that Some folks are just that careless Well

But Rebecca Mary did not hear the rest of the Callers leavetaking She
had slipped away to Thomas Jefferson out in the sun

Oh come herecome here with me she cried intensely Come out
behind the barn where we can talk Ive got to say something to you
thats awful Ive GOT to youve got to listen Thomas Jefferson

It was still and terribly hot in the treeless glare behind the barn but
it was all in the days work to Thomas Jefferson Behind the barn was a
beautiful place for bugs

Listen Oh you poor dear youve got to listen Rebecca Mary cried
Youve got to stop hunting for bugsand dont you dare to crow If you
crow Thomas Jefferson it will break my heart I dont spose you know
what youve doneI dont know as youve done itbut theres something
awful happened Oh Thomas Jefferson it glitteredI saw it glitter
Suddenly Rebecca Mary stooped and gathered Thomas Jefferson into her
arms She held him with a passionate clasp against her flat little
calico breast He was HERS He was all the intimate friend she had ever
had He had been her little downy baby and slept in her hand She had
fed him and watched him grow and been proud of him He was her all

Oh Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson what was it that glittered in
the grass Tell me and Ill believe you Say it was a little piece o
glass and Ill put you down and go get you some corn and well never
speak of it again But dont look at me like thatdont look at me like
that You lookGUILTY

She rocked him in her arms In her soul she knew what it was that had
glittered But in Thomas Jeffersons souloh they could not blame
Thomas Jefferson

You havent got any soul poor dear poor dear you havent got any
soul and you cant be guilty without a soul They couldnthangyou
Her voice sank to the merest whisper She tightened her clasp on the
great soft body and smoothed the soft feathers with a tender tremulous
little hand

The Lord didnt put anything in you but a stomach and aa gizzard He
left your soul out and youre not to blame for that I dont blame
you Thomas Jefferson and of course the Lord dont But Mrs Averys
boarderoh oh dear Im afraid Mrs Averys boarder will You mustnt
tellI mean I mustnt Nobody must know what it was that glittered in
the grass Do you want to besearched

You know xactly where she sat over to this house yesterday morning
when she went byand how she said you were too sweet for anythingand
how she flew her hand round withwith IT on it You know as well as I
do And it was loose the dimondstone was loose We didnt either of
us know that Were not to blame if things are loose and youre not to
blame for not having any soul But oh oh dear how dreadfully it makes
us both feel Youd better give up crowing Thomas Jefferson I feel
just as if youd let it out if you crew

At tea Rebecca Mary played with her spoon while her berries swam
untasted in their yellow sea of cream Aunt Olivia remonstrated

Why dont you eat your supper child she asked sharply Rebecca Mary
was always glad when she said child instead of Rebecca Mary for then
the sharpness did not cut She was feeling now for the glasses up in her
thin gray hair Aunt Olivia could see everything through those glasses
and it made Rebecca Mary tremble to thinkoh oh dear suppose she
should see the secret hidden in Rebecca Marys soul It seemed as if
Aunt Olivia trained the glasses directly upon the corner where the
secret glittered in the grawas hidden in Rebecca Marys troubled
little soul But this is what Aunt Olivia said

Its your stomach What you need is a good dose of camomile tea to
tone you up I didnt give you any this spring for a wonder Now you go
right up to bed and Ill set some to steeping Does it hurt you any

Oh yesm murmured Rebecca Mary sadly but she meant her soul and
Aunt Olivia meant her stomach She mounted the steep stairs to her
little eavesdropping room and slipped her small spare body out of her
clothes into her scant little nightgown It was rather a relief to go to
bed If she could have been sure that Thomas Jeffersonbut no
Thomas Jefferson was not in bed As Rebecca Mary lay and waited for her
camomile tea she was certain she could hear him stepping about under the
window Once he came directly under and crew and then Rebecca Mary
hid her head in the pillow for he was letting it out

Cockadoodledoooo didyouseemeswooooOOPitup crowed Thomas
Jefferson under the window Rebecca Mary with her eyes pillowdeep
could see him stretching his neck and letting it out It seemed to her
everybody could hear himAunt Olivia downstairs steeping camomile
blows and Mrs Averys boarder across the fields

Aunt Olivia whispered Rebecca Mary while she sipped her bitter tea
a little later how muchI suppose precious things cost a great deal
dont they

My grief Aunt Olivia set down the bowl and felt of Rebecca Marys
temples then of her wrists The child was out of her head

Dimondstones likelike that boardersI suppose those cost a great
deal As much ashow much as Aunt Olivia

My grief dont you worry about any dimondstones YOU havent lost
any What youll lose will be your health if you dont swallow down the
rest o this tea and go right to sleep like a good girl No no Im not
going to answer any questions Drink this swallow it down

Rebecca Mary swallowed it down but she did not go right to sleep like a
good girl She lay on the hard little bed and thought of many things or
of one thing many times Over and over wearily drearily until the sin
of Thomas Jefferson became her sin She adopted it

When at last she dropped to sleep it was to dream a Bible dream Usually
Rebecca Mary liked to dream Bible dreams but not this one This one was
different This one was of Abraham and Isaac She thought she was right
there and saw Abraham build the little altar and offer upno it wasnt
Isaac It was Thomas Jefferson And the Abraham in her dream was turning
into HER The flowing white robes were dwindling to a little scant white
nightgown She stood a little way off and saw herself offering up Thomas
Jefferson It was a dreadful dream

The night was a perfectly black one the kind that Rebecca Mary was
afraid of It was the only thing in the world she had ever been afraid
ofa black night But after the dream she got up stealthily and slipped
through the blackness out to Thomas Jefferson It was only out to the
little leanto shed but it seemed a very long way to Rebecca Mary
The blackness pressed up against her she put out her little trembling
hands and pushed through it

Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson she called softly But he was a
sound sleeper she remembered she would have to find him and wake him
In the darkness she felt about on Thomas Jeffersons perch for Thomas
Jefferson When the little groping hand came upon something very soft
and warm the other hand went up to join it and together they lifted
Thomas Jefferson down He gave a protesting croak and then because he
was acquainted with the clasp of the two small hands and night or day
liked it he went back to his interrupted dreams and said not another
word Thomas Jefferson had never dreamed a Bible dreamnever heard of
Abraham or Isaac had no soul to be disquieted

With her burden against her breast Rebecca Mary pushed back through the
darkness up to the black little room under the eaves She felt about
for her little carpetcovered shoe box and gently crowded the great
white bulk into it Then she crept back into bed and lay on the outer
edge with her loving light little hand on Thomas Jeffersons feathers
The trouble in her burdened soul poured itself out

Oh Thomas Jefferson she whispered down to the heap of soft feathers
Im going to smooth you this way all night for tomorrow you die Her
voice even in a whisper had a solemn inspired note Theres no other
way youll have to make up your mind to be willing Its going to break
my heart and oh Im afraid it will break yours Im afraid it will
kill us both

Thomas Jefferson uttered a mournful little croaky sound that might have
been ET TU BRUTE It pierced Rebecca Marys breast There hush
poor dear poor dear and rest Youll need all your sleep she crooned
softly and brokenly Tomorrow morning Ill give you some beautiful
corn and thenand then Im going to take you to Mrs Averys boarder
and tell her the worst Im going to give you up Thomas Jefferson and
Im the best friend youve got in the world But Ive got to Ive got
toIve got to Its been revealed to me in a dream There was a man
once in the Bible named Abraham and there was his dearly beloved
little boy named Isaac And now heres me named Rebecca Mary and
dearly beloved you named Thomas Jefferson Oh I dont suppose you can
understand I suppose youre asleep Youll never know how it feels to
give up your dearly belovedest but oh oh dear youll know how it
feels to be given up Youll be one o the blessed martyrs Thomas
Jeffersondoesnt that comfort you a little speck Oh why dont you
wake up and be comforted

The Lord excused Abraham after all But this isnt the Lord its Mrs
Averys boarder Im afraid she isnt the Lords kindIm afraid not
Thomas Jefferson I dont dare to let you hope Ive got to prepare you
for the worst

She caught up the big white fellow with sudden irresistible yearning
and sat up with him and rocked him back and forth in her arms She began
a muffled sad little tune like a wail The words were terrible words

Ill hold you in my arms Ill rock yourock yourock you For
tomorrow oh toMORrow youmustdie Aberaham offered Isaac and
_I_MUST OFFER YOU

Over and over then tenderly she lowered Thomas Jefferson to the shoe
box again

When Aunt Olivia came up in the morning vaguely alarmed because it
was so late and no Rebecca Mary stirring she had news to tell Someone
going by had told her something

Well that womans found her dimondstonehow are you feeling this
morning child It was in her pocket where shed put her hand in and
felt round So all that fuss for noth

Suddenly Aunt Olivia stopped for without warning out of a box at the
bedside stalked a great white rooster and flew to the foot board and
crew


 Cockadoodledoooo
 It was glass that glittered in the grass
 And all the time I knewooooo

My grief Aunt Olivia gasped




The Cookbook Diary



Rebecca Mary decided to keep a diary It was not an inspiration though
it was rather like one in its suddenness Of course she had always known
that Aunt Olivia kept a diary When she was very small she had stretched
atiptoe and with little pointing forefinger counted rows and rows of
little black books that Aunt Olivia had kept Each little black book
had its yearlabel pasted neatly on the back Rebecca Mary breathed
deep breaths of awe there were so many of them There must be so much
weather in those little black booksso many pleasant days rainy days
storms and snows

It was Rebecca Mary who remembered that it was Tuesday and that it had
showered a little Wednesdayshone Thursdayshowered again on Friday
Rebecca Mary was the jog to Aunt Olivias memory It gave her now at
the beginning of her own diary career an experienced feeling as if she
knew already how to keep a diary It made it seem a much simpler matter
to begin

And then of course the ministers littlest little boyreally it was
the ministers littlest little boy who had started Rebecca Mary He had
volunteered a peep into his own diary and made whispered explanations
and suggestions He let Rebecca Mary read some of the entries MUNDY
plesent and good TUSDY rany and bad WENSDY sum plesent and not
good enuf to hirt THIRSDY but he had hastily withdrawn the book at
Thirsdy and a tidalwave of warm red blood had flowed up over his
little brown ears and in around all the little brown islands of his
freckles So Rebecca Mary had begun hastily to talk of other things
For the ministers littlest little boy had explained that the first
Statement in each entry referred to the weather and the second to the
deportment of the writer and Rebecca Mary had remarked a sympathetic
resemblance between the two statements She had caught a fleeting
glimpse of the weather part of Thirsdyshe could guess the rest
Better let the curtain fall on Thirsdy On her way home Rebecca Mary
decided to keep a diary herself Her first days record had been a good
deal like the Mundy of the ministers littlest little boy only there
were more as in the weather After that little by little she branched
out into a certain originalitythe Rebecca Mary sort If she had
not been hampered by circumstances it would have been easier to be
original The most hampering circumstance was the cookbook itself which
she was driven to use in her new undertaking There was room on the
blank leaves and above and below the recipes for cake and pudding
and pie The book was one Aunt Olivia had given her long ago to draw
impossible pictures in

In the beginning Rebecca Mary tried pasting pieces of empty paper
over the pies and puddings and cakes but the empty paper was too
transparent In rather startling places things were liable to show
through

As SUNDAYIt rained a level teaspoonful Aunt Olivia and I went to
church The text was thou shalt not steal 1 cups of sour milk Rebecca
Mary got no farther than that She was a little appalled at the result
thus far and hastily turned a page and began again in a blank space
where no intrusive pudding could break through and corrupt Thereafter
she wrote above and below the recipes and pasted no more thin veils over
them It seemed safer

Aunt Olivia apparently oblivious to what was going on yet saw and did
not disapprove It was to be expected that the child should come into
her inheritance sometime early or late If earlywell

Its the Plummer in her All the Plummers have kept diaries Aunt
Olivia mused knitting stolidly on while the child stooped painfully
to her selfimposed task The quaint resemblance to herself at her own
diarywriting did not escape her and she smiled a little in the Aunt
Olivia way that scarcely stirred her lips Aunt Olivia smiled oftener
now when she looked at the child She was failing a little Plummerly
Between the two of them little Plummer and big stretched of late a tie
woven of sheets and a gorgeous quilt of a thousand bits It was not very
visible to the naked eye but they were both rather shyly conscious that
it was there They would never be quite so far apart again

Rebecca Mary took her diary out to the haunts of Thomas Jefferson and
read aloud selections to him with an odd conscious little air as
though she were graduating The great white fellow was a sympathetic
auditor if silence and extreme gravity count Only once did he ever
make comments and Rebecca Mary could never quite make up her mind
whether he laughed then or applauded When a great white rooster
elongates his neck crooks it ridiculously flaps his wings and crows
its hard telling exactly what feeling prompts him But Rebecca reasoned
from past experience and her faith in himhe had never laughed at her
before It was applause The especial entry which evoked it was the one
that first mentioned an allowance

THURSDAYI think Im going to read Rebecca Mary slowly and it
was significant that on this Thursday there was no weather I havent
desidedI dont KNOW but I think Im going to ask Aunt Olivia to pay
me 5 cents a weak Rhoda says you call it an alowance and I supose she
knows She is the minnisters daughter She has 10 cents a weak unless
shes bad and then she pays the minnister an alowance He charges her 1
cent a sin and he gives it to somebody who is indignantI think Rhoda
said indignant Then I should think he would give it back to Rhoda I
shant only ask Aunt Olivia for 5 centsI think she will be more likely
I havent desided but I THINK I shall ask her tomorrow after her knap
After knaps you are more rested and maybe things dont look just as they
do before knaps

FRIDAYI think Ide better wait untill tomorrow Her knap was rather
short Ive desided to say you needent alow but 4 if 5 is too mutch If
she alows Im going to buy me some crimpers Rhodas curls natchurally but
she says you can crimp it if it doesent I have begun to look at myself
in the glass and it fritens meI guess there ought to be a gh in
thatto see how homebly I am I wonder if it doesent kind of scare Aunt
Olivia Prehaps if I was pretty like Rhoda she would call me darling and
dear instead of Rebecca Mary I dont blame her mutch because I LOOK like
Rebecca Mary

SATURDAYI think Sunday will be the best time to ask her just
after she gets home from meeting and has rolled her bonnet strings up
espesialy if the minnister preaches on the Lord lovething a cheerful
giver I am hopeing he will If I dont get the crimpers Ime going to
give up looking in the glass For I think Ime growing homeblyer right
along Theres something the matter with my nose Rhodas doesent run up
hill I never thought about noses before Aunt Olivias is a little quear
too but I like it became its Aunt Olivias nose I wish I knew if Aunt
Olivia liked mine I wish we were better akquainted

SUNDAYI wish the Lord had created mine curly because I dont dass
to ask Aunt Olivia I dont dass to so there It scares my throat I
supose its because aunts arnt mothersseems as if youd dass to ask your
MOTHER I hate to be scart on acount of being a Plummer Im afraid Im
the only Plummer that ever was

The reading suddenly stopped here This was Sunday and the last entry
was fresh from Rebecca Marys pencil

Thomas Jefferson stormed Rebecca Mary in a little gust of passion
dont you ever TELL I was scared As long as you livecross your
heartoh I wish I hadnt read that part to you Youre a Plummer too
and you never were scared and you cant understand

The diary was clutched to Rebecca Marys little flat breast and with a
swirl of starched Sunday skirts the child was gone She went straight
to Aunt Olivia Red spots of shame flamed in both sallow little cheeks
resolution sat astride her little uphill nose She could not bear to go
but it was easier than being ashamed The pointing fingers of all the
Plummers pushed her on Go she must or be a coward Long agoit seemed
long to Rebecca Maryshe had stood up straight and stanch and refused
to make any more sheets Was that little girl who had dared THIS little
girl who was afraid Should that little girl be ashamed of this one

Aunt Olivia steadily though Rebecca Marys heart was pounding
hardAunt Olivia areare you well off

She had not meant to begin like that but afterwards she was glad that
she had

My grief Aunt Olivia ejaculated in her surprise What would the child
ask next Am I well off If you mean rich no I aint

Oh Then yourewhy I didnt think about your being poor I shouldnt
have thought of askingthat makes a great difference I never thought
of THAT

She was off before Aunt Olivia had fully recovered her breath and
the stumping of her heavy little shoes going upstairs was the only
distinctly audible sound In her own room Rebecca Mary stopped panting

Oh Im glad I didnt get as far as ASKING she breathed aloud I
never thought about her being poorof course then I wouldnt ask

But she squared her shoulders and stood up straight and unashamed For
she had vindicated herself She had been ready to ask She could look
that other little girl of the sheets in the face The Other Little Girl
was there coming to meet her as she advanced to the little looking
glass above the table But Rebecca Mary waved her back peremptorily

Go right back she said I only came to tell you I wasnt a
cowardthats all Goodbye For Im not coming any more Youre sorry
Im homely and Im sorry you are but it doesnt do any good for us to
look at each other and groan It will make us unsatisfied So I shall
turn you back to the wallgoodbye

But for a very long instant they looked sadly into each others
little lean brownyellow faces It was a brief ceremony of farewell
Goodbye smiled Rebecca Mary bravely And the lips of The Other
Little Girl moved as though saying it too The Other Little Girl smiled
And neither of them knew that just then she was beautiful

Aunt Olivia was trying to meet her own courage test She had been trying
a good many days Dutystern unswerving dutybade her inspect Rebecca
Marys little cookbook diary Should she not knowought she not to know
the thoughts that were brewing in the childs mind How else could she
bring her up properly

Read it Duty said find out Are you afraid

Im ashamed groaned Aunt Olivia Do you think Rebecca Mary would
read my diary

Is Rebecca Mary bringing you up

Aunt Olivia sometimes thought so The puzzle that she had begun to try
to solve when Rebecca Marys white deathstruck mother had laid her
baby in Aunt Olivias unaccustomed arms was getting a little more
difficult every day Some days Aunt Olivia wondered if she ought to give
it up Oh this bringing upthis bringing up of little children

If I must groaned Aunt Olivia and got as far as taking the little
diary in her hands But she got no farther She laid it gently down
again

I cant she said firmly but she could not look Duty in the face as
she said it She had always listened to Duty before

You know you ought to

Yes I know but I cant It seems a shameful thing to do Im sure
Ive tried often enoughyou know Ive tried

I knowthat was good practice Now stop trying and read it

Aunt Olivia flamed up I tell you I wont Its a shameful thing If
I found Rebecca Mary reading one of my diaries I should send her to
bed

Read hers and go to bed yourself Its your duty to read it When you
bring up a child

I never will again

Aunt Olivia read it with the relentless grip of Duty holding her to the
task But flame spots crept up through the sallow of her thin cheeks and
made what atonement they could

It did not take long though some of the pages she read twice The
weatherless week when Rebecca Mary had put off her asking from day to
day Aunt Olivia went back to the third time When she closed the little
book it was not a Plummer face she lifted it to and laid it against for
the space of a breatha Plummer face would not have been wet

Then she Whirled upon Duty Well Ive done itI hope youre
satisfied

It had to be done calm Duty responded If you think it will make you
feel any better you can send yourself to bed

Im going to sighed Aunt Olivia slipping away to her room A strange
little yearning was upon her to hunt up Rebecca Mary and call her
darling and dear But in her heart she knew she should not have the
courage to do it Here was another Plummer coward

Why are some people made like me she thoughtso it kills em to
say anything anyways tenderish Seems to be too much for their vocal
organstheyd rather do a weeks washing

Other thoughts came to Aunt Olivia as she lay on her bed doing her
whimsical penance for violating the sanctity of the little old cookbook
She was not comfortable It was a hard bednothing was soft of Aunt
Olivias She moved about on it uneasily

When theyre dead were willing enough to say tenderish things to
em her musings ran We wish we HAD then I suppose if Rebecca Mary
was

She got no farther for the sudden horror that was upon herthat sent
her to her feet and to the door But there she stopped in the blessed
relief that drifted in to her on a childs laugh Somewhere out there
Rebecca Mary was laughing in her subdued sweet way A cracked shrill
crow followedThomas Jefferson was laughing too

Rebecca Mary was not dead There was time to say a tenderish thing to
her before she laybefore that Aunt Olivia shut her eyes resolutely to
the vision that had intruded upon her musings It was Rebecca Mary who
was laughing somewhere out there that she wanted to see

The next day was Sunday and in the quiet of the long afternoon Rebecca
Mary read aloud again to Thomas Jefferson It was from the little
cookbook diary Thomas Jefferson was pecking about the long grass of the
orchard

Oh listen cried Rebecca Mary her eyes unwontedly shining Listen
to this Thomas Jefferson

SATURDAYWind northwest by Mrs Tuppers Weather vain Something
happened yesterday Aunt Olivia didnt say it but she most did
She came right out of her bedroom and I saw it in her face
Deardarlingthey were both there and she was looking at me
Nobody EVER looked dear darling at me before I suppose my mother
would have If I hadent had another mother I think I should like to have
had Aunt Olivia

You feel that way more after you get akquainted When I get VERY
akquainted prehaps I shall tell Aunt Olivia Its quear I think how it
isent as easy to say some things as it is to think them You can wright
them easier too I am glad Ime keeping a diary because I can wright
about yesterday and what happenned I shall read it to my grand
childrento be continude

SUNDAYthats today Thomas JeffersonSUNDAYThis is yesterday
continude because there was too mutch for one day Something else
beutiful happenned My Aunt Olivia said to me as folows I have desided
to pay you a weakly alowance of 10 cents a weak Rebecca Mary And I
never asked her to And she never said anything about charging me for
my sins I was going to ask her but I found out she was poor That was a
mistake she isent She must be SOME well of I think for 10 cents seams
a great deal to have of your own every weak But I shant buy crimpers
Ime going to buy a present for Aunt Olivia byamby Ime very happy I
wish I knew how to spell hooray

Suddenly Rebecca Mary was on her feet waving the cookbook jubilantly

Hooray Hooray Thomas Jefferson she shouted surprising the gentle
Sunday calm She surprised Thomas Jefferson too but he was equal to
the occasionThomas Jefferson was a gentleman

Hooraaaay he crowed splendidly with a fine effect of clapping
his hands

This time there could be no doubt This was applause




The Bereavement



Thomas Jefferson was losing his appetite Even Aunt Olivia noticed it
but it did not worry her as it did Rebecca Mary

Hes always had as many appetites as a cats got liveshes got eight
good ones left she said calmly

But Rebecca Mary was not calm It seemed to her that Thomas Jefferson
was getting thinner every day

Oh I can feel your bones she cried in distress Your bones are
coming through you poor dear Thomas Jefferson Wont you eat just one
more kernel of cornjust this one for Rebecca Mary Id do it for you
Shut your eyes and swallow it right down and youll never know it

That day Thomas Jefferson listened to pleading but not the next
daynor the next He went about dispiritedly and the last few times
that he crowed it made Rebecca Mary cry Even Aunt Olivia shook her
head

I could do it better than that myself she said soberly

Rebecca Mary hunted bugs and angleworms and arranged them temptingly in
rows but the big white rooster passed them by with a feeble peck
or two Bits of bread failed to tempt him or even his favorite cooky
crumbs His eighth appetite departedhis seventh sixth fifth fourth

He lost his third one yesterday lamented Rebecca Mary and today
hes lost his second Its pretty bad when he hasnt only one left Aunt
Olivia

Pretty bad nodded Aunt Olivia She was stirring up a warm mush
When Rebecca Mary had gone upstairs she took it to Thomas Jefferson
and commanded him to eat He was beyond coaxingperhaps he needed
commanding

Rebecca Mary thought Aunt Olivia did not care and it added a new sting
to her pain There was that time that Aunt Olivia said she wished the
Lord hadnt ever created roostersThomas Jefferson had just scratched
up her pansy seeds And the time when she wished Thomas Jefferson was
dead did she wish that now Was shewas she glad he was going to be
dead

For Rebecca Mary had given up hope She was not reconciled but she was
sure She spent all her spare time with the big gaunt pitiful fellow
trying to make his last days easier She knew he liked to have her with
him

You do dont you dear she said She had never called him dear
before She realized sadly that this was her last chance You do like
to have me here dont you Youd rather Dont try to crowjust nod
your head a little if you do And the big white fellows head had
nodded a little she was sure She put out her loving little brown hand
and caressed it I knew you did dear Oh Thomas Jefferson Thomas
Jefferson dont die PLEASE dontthink of the good times well
have if you wont Think of thethe grasshoppersthe bugs Thomas
Jeffersonthe cookies Wont you thinkwont you try to be a little
bit hungry

Rebecca Mary knew what it was to be hungry and not be able to eat
but to be able to eat and not be hungrythis was away and beyond her
experience The sad puzzle of it she could not solve

One day the minister had a rather surprising summons to perform his
priestly functions The summoner was Rebecca Mary She appeared like
a sombre little shadow in his sunny sermon room The ministers wife
ushered her in and in the brief instant of opening the door and
announcing her name flashed him a warning glance He had been acquainted
so long with her glances that he was able to interpret this one with
considerable accuracy All right he glanced back No he would not
smileyes he would remember that it was Rebecca Mary

Do what she asks you flashed the ministers wifes glance

All right flashed the minister Then the door closed

Thomas Jefferson is dying Rebecca Mary began hurriedly I came to
see if youd come

In spite of himself the minister gasped Then as the situation dawned
clearly upon him his mouth corners beganin spite of themselvesto
curve upward But in time he remembered the ministers wife and drew
them back to their centres of gravity He waited a little It was safer

Aunt Olivia isnt at home and Im glad She doesnt care Perhaps she
would laugh Oh I know appealed Rebecca Mary piteously I know
hes a rooster It isnt because I dont knowbut hes FOLKS to me You
neednt do anything but just smooth his feathers a little and say the
Lord bless you I thought perhaps youd come and do that _I_ could but
I wanted you to because youre a minister I thoughtI thought perhaps
youd try and forget hes a rooster

I will the minister said gently Now his lips were quite grave He
took Rebecca Marys hand and went with her

Hes a good man murmured the ministers wife watching them go She
had known he would go

He was one of my parishioners the minister was saying for the
comforting of Rebecca Mary Unconsciously he used the past tense as
one speaks of those close to death It was well enough for already big
gaunt white Thomas Jefferson was in the past tense

Rebecca Mary chronicled the sad event in her diary

Tomas Jefferson passed away at ten minutes of three this afternoon
blessed are them that die in the Lord The minnister did not get here in
time I wish I had asked him to run for he is a very good minnister and
would have He helped me berry him in the cold cold ground and we sang a
him I dident ask him to pray because he was only a rooster but he
was folks to me I loved him It is very lonesome I dred wakening up
tomorrow because he always crowed under my window The Lord gaveth and
the Lord has taken away

This last Rebecca Mary erased once but she wrote it again after a
moments thought For she reasoned it was the Lord part of Aunt Olivia
which had given Thomas Jefferson to her In the primitive little creed
of Rebecca Mary every one had a Lord part but some peoples was very
small Not Aunt Oliviasshe had never gauged Aunt Olivias Lord part
it would not have been consistent with her ideas of loyalty

It was very lonely as Rebecca Mary had known it would be At best
her life had never been overfull of companionships and the sudden
takingoffit seemed sudden as all deaths doof Thomas Jefferson was
hard to bear Strange how blank a space one great white rooster can
leave behind him

The yard and the orchard seemed full of blank spaces though in a way
Thomas Jeffersons soul seemed to frequent his old beloved haunts
Rebecca Mary could not see it pecking daintily about but she felt it
was there

His soul isnt dead she persisted gently She clung to the comfort
of that And one morning she thought she heard again Thomas Jeffersons
old cheery greeting to the sunrise The sound she thought she heard
woke her instantly Was it Thomas Jeffersons soul crowing

Aunt Olivia isent sorry chronicled the diary sadly Prehaps shes
glad Once she wished the Lord had forgot to create roosters But she
was ever kind to Tomas Jefferson considdering the seeds he scrached up
That was his besittingest sin and I know he is sorry now I wish Aunt
Olivia was sorry

Nothing was ever said between the two about Rebecca Marys loss but
Aunt Olivia recognized the keenness of it to the child She worried
a little about it it reminded her of that other time of worry when
Rebecca Mary and she had nearly starved Sheets and roostersthere were
so many worries in the world

That other time she went to the minister this time to the ministers
wife One afternoon she went and carried her work

You know about children she began without loss of time What
happens when they lose their appetite over a dead rooster

Thomas Jefferson breathed the ministers wife softly

Yeshes dead and buried and shes mourning for him I set three
tarts on for dinner today and I set three tarts AWAY after dinner
Rebecca Mary is fond of tarts What should you do if it was Rhoda

OhRhodawhy I think I should get her another rooster or a cat or
something to get her mind off But Rhoda isnt Rebecca Mary

Aunt Olivia folded up her work She got up briskly

Theyve got a white rooster down to the Trumbullses she said I
guess I better go right down now Tony Trumbull is liable to be at home
just before supper Im very much obliged to you for your advice

Did I advise her murmured the ministers wife watching the resolute
swing of Aunt Olivias skirts as she strode away I was going to tell
her that what would cure my Rhoda might not cure Rebecca Mary Well I
hope it will work but she was sure it wouldnt She had grown a little
acquainted with Rebecca Mary

It was the new white rooster crowing instead of the soul of Thomas
Jefferson Rebecca Mary found out after she had dressed and gone
downstairs Soon after that she appeared in the kitchen doorway with an
armful of snowy feathers Aunt Olivia over her muffin pans eyed her
with secret delight The cure was working sooner than she had dared to
expect

This is the Tony Trumbullses rooster if I hurry I guess I can carry
him back before breakfast Rebecca Mary said from the doorway Ill
run Aunt Olivia

Carry him back Aunt Olivias muffin spoon dropped into the bowl of
creamy batter One look at Rebecca Mary convinced her that the cure had
not begun to work Imperceptibly she stiffened He aint anybodys but
mine Ive bought him she explained briefly You set him down
and feed him with these crumbshe aint human if he dont like
clothogold cake

But the child in the doorway after gently releasing the great fellow
drew away quietly The second look at her face convinced Aunt Olivia
that the cure would never work

You feed him please Aunt Olivia Rebecca Mary said Icouldnt
Ill stir the muffins up

Nothing further was ever said about keeping the Tony Trumbull rooster
He pecked about the place in unrestrained freedom until the morning work
was done and then Aunt Olivia carried him home in her apron

I concluded not to keep himhed likely be homesick she said with
a qualm of conscience for the big white fellow had certainly shown no
signs of homesickness But she could not explain and reveal the secret
places of Rebecca Marys heart Aunt Olivia too had her ideas of
loyalty

In the diary there occurred brief mention of the episode The Tony
Trumbull rooster has been here I could eat himthats how I feel about
the Tony Trumbull rooster

I never could have eatten Tomas Jefferson but once and then it would
have broken my heart but I was starveing Aunt Olivia took him back

Thomas Jeffersons grave was kept green Rebecca Mary took her stents
down into the orchard and sat beside it sadly stitching She kept it
heaped with wild flowers and poppies from her own rows Aunt Olivias
flowers she never touched The bitterness of Aunt Olivias not being
sorryperhaps being gladrankled in her sore little soul It would
have helpedoh yes it would have helped

Aunt Olivia worried on It seemed to her that all Rebecca Marys meals
in one meal would not have kept a kitten aliveand that reminded her
She would try a kitten The ministers wife had said a rooster or a cat
A white kitten she decided though she could scarcely have told why

The kitten was better but it was not a cure Rebecca Mary took the
little creature to her breast and told it her grief for Thomas Jefferson
and cried her Thomas Jefferson tears into its soft white fur In that
way at any rate it was a success

Maybe I shall love you some day she whispered but I cant yet
while Thomas Jefferson is fresh Hes all I have room for He was
my intimate friendwhen your intimate friend is dead you cant
love anybody else right away But she apologized to the little cat
gentlyshe felt that an apology was due it

You see how it is little white cat she said I shall have to ask
you to wait But if I ever have a second love I promise it will be
you Youre a great DEAL comfortinger than that Tony Trumbull rooster I
could love you this minute if I had never loved Thomas Jefferson Do you
feel like waiting

The little white cat waited And Aunt Olivia waited She made tempting
dishes for Rebecca Marys meals and put a ruffle into her nightgown
neck and sleevesRebecca Mary had always yearned for ruffles

I dont believe she sees em She dont know theyre there groaned
Aunt Olivia impotently She dont see anything but Thomas Jefferson
and I dont know as she ever will

But Rebecca Mary saw the ruffles and fluted them between her brown
little fingers admiringly She tried once or twice to go and thank Aunt
Olivia and got as far as her bedroom door But the bitterness in her
heart stayed her hand from turning the knob If Aunt Olivia had only
known that being sorry was the right thing to do Strangely enough
though Rebecca Marys view of the matter never occurred to Aunt Olivia
she came by and by to being sorry on her own account Perhaps she had
been all along underneath her disquietude for Rebecca Marys sorrow
Perhaps when she thought how quiet it had grown mornings and what a
good chance there was now for a supplementary nap she was being sorry
When she remembered that she need not buy wheat now and yellow corn and
that the cookies would last longerperhaps then she was sorry But
she did not know it It seemed to come upon her with the nature of a
surprise on one especial day She had been working her unscrached
untrampled flowerbeds

My grief she ejaculated suddenly as if just aware of it I declare
I believe I miss him too I believe to my soul Id like to hear him
crowI wouldnt mind if he came strutting in here And in here was
Aunt Olivias beloved garden of flowers Surely she was being sorry now

It was the next day that Rebecca Marys bitterness was sweetenedthat
she began to be cured She and the little white cat went down together
to Thomas Jeffersons resting place When they went homeand they went
soonRebecca Mary got her diary and began to write in it with eager
haste Her sombre little face had lighted up with some inner gladness
like relief

Shes been there and put some lavvender on and pinks I mean Aunt
Olivia And shes the very fondest of her pinks and lavvender So she
must have loved Tomas Jefferson Shes sorry Shes sorry Shes sorry And
Ime so glad

Rebecca Mary caught up the little white cat and cried her first tear of
joy on its neck Then she wrote again

Now there are two morners instead of one Two morners seams so mutch
lovinger than only one I know he must feal better I think he must have
been hurt before and so was I I wish I dass tell Aunt Olivia how glad I
am shes sorry

But she told only the little white cat The Plummer mantle of reticence
had fallen too heavily on her narrow little shoulders What she longed
to do she did not dass But that evening in her little ruffled
nightgown she went to Aunt Olivias room and thanked her for the
ruffles

Theyre beautiful she murmured in a small agony of shyness I think
it was very kind of you to ruffle meIve always wanted to be Thank
you very much And then she had scurried away on her bare feet to the
safe retreat of her own room under the eaves Aunt Olivia left behind
was unconsciously relieved at not having to respond She was glad the
child had discovered the ruffles and was pleased It was a good sign

Ill mix up some pancakes in the morning Aunt Olivia said
complacently Pancakes may help along Rebecca Mary is fond of em

The pinks and the fragrant lavender appeared to have established
a certain unspoken comradeship between the two morners of Thomas
Jefferson Thereafter Rebecca Mary went about comforted and Aunt Olivia
relieved The little white cat purred about the skirts of one and the
stubbedout toes of the other in cheerful content

Well the ministers wife queried in a moment of social intercourse
after church She and Aunt Olivia walked down the aisle together

Shes getting over itor beginning to nodded Aunt Olivia That
other rooster didnt work but I think the little cat is going to She
hugs it

Good But she still mourns Thomas Jef

Of course Aunt Olivia interposed rather crisply You couldnt
expect her to get over it all in a minute He was a remarkable rooster

She misses him herself inwardly smiled the ministers little wife
Whether by virtue of her relationship to the minister or by her own
virtue she had learned to read human nature with a degree of accuracy

I looked at myself in the glass tonight confessed Rebecca Marys
diary but it was on acount of the rufles I think Ime not quite so
homebly in rufles I think Aunt Olivia was kind to rufle me I should
like to ware this night gown in the day time I wish folks did

The pencil slipped out of Rebecca Marys fingers and rolled on the
floor to the undoing of the little white cat who had gone to bed in
his basket Rebecca Mary caught him up as he darted after the pencil
and hugged him in an odd little ecstasy She felt oddly happy

You little white cat she cried muffledly her face in his thick
coat youve waited and waited but I think Im going to love you
nowyou neednt wait any more




The Feel Doll



The minister uttered a suppressed note of warning as solid little steps
sounded in the hall It was he who threw a hasty covering over the doll
The ministers wife sewed on undisturbedly She did worse than that

Come here Rhoda she called and tell me which you like better
three tucks or five in this petticoat

Five promptly upon inspection Rhoda pulled away the concealing
cover and regarded the stolid doll with tilted head Shes nough like
my Pharaohs Daughter to be a blood relation she remarked Shes got
the Pharaoh complexion

Spoken like MY daughter laughed the minister But I thought new
dolls in this house were always surprises And heres Mrs Minister
making doll petticoats out in the open

This is Rebecca MarysIm dressing a doll for Rebecca Mary Robert
Shes eleven years old and never had a doll Rhodas ten and has
hadHow many dolls have you had Rhoda

Gracious Why Pharaohs Daughter an Caiapha an Esther the
Beautiful Queen an the Children of Israelfive o theman Mrs Job
an

Never mind the rest dear You hear Robert Do you think Rhoda would
be alive now if shed never had a doll

The minister pondered the question Maybe not maybe not he decided
but possibly the dolls would have been

Dont make me smile Robert Im trying to make you cry If Rebecca
Mary were sixty instead of eleven I should dress her a doll

Then why not one for Miss Olivia

I may dress her one undauntedly if I find out she never had one in
her life

She never did The ministers voice was positive And for that
reason dear arent you afraid she would not approve of Rebecca Marys
having one Isnt it rather a delicate mat

Dont Robert dont discourage me Its going to be such a beautiful
doll And you neednt tell me that poor little elevenyearold
womanchild wont hold out her empty arms for it Robert youre a
minister would it be wrong to give it to her STRAIGHT

Straight dear

Yes without saying anything to her aunt Olivia Tell me Rhodas gone
Say it asas liberally as you can

The minister for answer swept doll petticoat and ministers wife into
his arms and kissed them all impartially

Think if it were Rhoda she pleaded

And you were Aunt Olivia You ask me to think such hard things dear
If I could stop being a minister long enough

Stop she laughed but she knew she meant keep on With a sigh she
burrowed a little deeper in his neck Then Ill ask Aunt Olivia first
she said

She went back to her tucking Only once more did she mention Rebecca
Mary The once was after she had come downstairs from tucking the
children into bed She stood in the doorway with the look in her face
that mothers have after doing things like that The minister loved that
look

Robert nights when I kiss the childrenyou knew when you married me
that I was foolishI kiss little lone Rebecca Mary too I began the
day Thomas Jefferson diedI went to the RebeccaMaryest window and
threw her a kiss I went tonight Dont say a word you knew when you
married me

Aunt Olivia received the resplendent doll in silence Plummer honesty
and Plummer politeness were at variance Plummer politeness said Thank
her For goodness sake arent you going to thank the ministers wife
But Plummer honesty grim and yieldless said You cant thank her
because youre not thankful So Aunt Olivia sat silent with her
resplendent doll across her knees

For Rebecca Mary the ministers wife was saying in rather a halting
way I dressed it for her I thought perhaps she never

She never said Aunt Olivia briefly Strange that at that particular
instant she should remember a trifling incident in the childs faroff
childhood The incident had to do with a little white nightgown rolled
tightly and pinned together She had found Rebecca Mary in her little
waist and petticoat cuddling it in bed

Its a dollie Please sh Aunt Olivia or youll wake her up the
child had whispered in an agony Oh youre not agoing to turn her
back to a nightgown Dont unpin her Aunt Oliviait will kill her
Ill name her after you if youll let her stay

Get up and take your clothes off Strange Aunt Olivia should remember
at this particular instant should remember too that the pin had
been a little rusty and came out hard Rebecca Mary had slid out of bed
obediently but there had been a look on her little brown face as of one
bereaved She had watched the pin come out and the nightgown unroll in
stricken silence When it hung released and limp over Aunt Olivias arm
she had given one little cry

Shes dead

The ministers wife was talking hurriedly Her voice seemed a good
way off it had the effect of coming nearer and growing louder as Aunt
Olivia stepped back across the years

Of course you are to do as you think best about giving it to her the
ministers wife said unwillingly This came of being a ministers wife
But I thinkI have always thoughtthat little girls oughtI
mean Rhoda oughtto have dolls to cuddle It seems part of
theirherinheritance This was hard work If Miss Olivia would not
sit there looking like that

As if Id done something unkind thought the gentle little mother
indignantly She got up presently and went away But Aunt Olivia with
the doll hanging unhealthily over her arm followed her to the door
There was something the Plummer honesty insisted upon Aunt Olivias
saying She said it reluctantly

I think I ought to tell you that Ive never believed in dolls Ive
always thought they were a waste of time and kept children from learning
to do useful things Ive brought Rebecca Mary up according to my best
light

Worst darkness thought the ministers wife hotly

Shes never had a doll I never had one I got along I could make
butter when I was seven So perhaps youd better take the doll

No no Please keep it Miss Olivia and if you should ever change your
mindI mean perhaps sometimegoodbye Its a beautiful day isnt
it

Aunt Olivia took it up into the guest chamber and laid it in an empty
bureau drawer She closed the drawer hastily She did not feel as
dutyproof as she had once felt before things had happenedsoftening
things that had pulled at her heartstrings and weakened her The quilt
on the guest chamber bed was one of the things she would not look at it
now And the sheets under the quiltand the grave of Thomas Jefferson
that she could see from the guest chamber window Aunt Olivia was
terribly beset with the temptation to take the doll out to Rebecca Mary
in the garden

Are you going to do it demanded Duty confronting her Are you
going to give up all your convictions now Rebecca Marys in her twelfth
yearpretty late to begin to humor her I thought you didnt believe in
humoring

I unpinned the nightgown parried Aunt Olivia on the defensive I
never let her make another one

But youre weakening now You want to let her have THIS doll

It seems like part ofof her inheritance

Lock that drawer

Aunt Olivia turned the key unhappily It was not that her convictions
had changedit was her heart

She went up at odd times and looked at the doll the ministers wife had
dressed She had an unaccountable uncomfortable feeling that it was
lying there in its coffinthat Rebecca Mary would have said Shes
dead

It was a handsome doll Aunt Olivia was not acquainted with dolls
but she acknowledged that She admired it unwillingly She liked its
clothesthe ministers wife had not spared any pains She had not
stinted in tucks nor ruffles

Once Aunt Olivia took it out and turned it over in her hands with
critical intent but there was nothing to criticise It was a beautiful
doll She held it with a curious shy tenderness But that time she did
not sit down with it It was the next time

The rocker was so near the bureau and Aunt Olivia was tiredand the
doll was already in her arms She only sat down For a minute she sat
quite straight and unrelaxed then she settled back a littlea little
more The doll lay heavily against her its flaxen head touching her
breast After the manner of highbred dolls its eyes drooped sleepily

Aunt Olivia began to rocka gentle sway back and forth She was sixty
but this was the first time she had ever rocked a chia doll So she
rocked for a little scarcely knowing it When she found out a wave of
soft pink dyed her face and flowed upward redly to her hair

Well Duty jibed mocking her

Dont say a word cried poor Aunt Olivia Ill put her right back

What good will that do

Ill lock her in

Youve locked her in before

IllIll hide the key

Where you can find it Think again

Aunt Olivia thrust the doll back into its coffin with unsteady hands
The red in her face had faded to a faint abiding pink She locked the
drawer and drew out the key She strode to the window and flung it out
with a wide sweep of her arm

The ministers wife ignorant of the results of her kind little
experiment resolved to question Rebecca Mary the next time she came on
an errand She would do it with extreme caution

Ill just feel round she said I want to know if her aunts given it
to her You think she must have dont you Robert By this time Why
it was six weeks ago I carried it over It was such a nice friendly
little doll By this time they would be such friendsif her aunt gave
it to her Robert you think

I think its going to rain the minister said But he kissed her to
make it easier

Rebecca Mary came over to bring Aunt Olivias rule for parsoncake that
the ministers wife had asked for

Come in Rebecca Mary the ministers wife said cordially Dont you
want to see the new dress Rhodas doll is going to have I suppose you
could make your dolls dress yourself It seemed a hard thing to say
Feeling round was not pleasant

Phaps I could but she doesnt wear dresses Rebecca Mary answered
gravely

No This was puzzling Her clothes dont come off I suppose Then
it could not be the nice friendly doll

Nom Nor they dont go on either She isnt a feel doll

Awhat kind did you say dear The ministers wife paused in her work
interestedly Distinctly Miss Olivia had not given her THE doll but
this dollI dont think I quite understood Rebecca Mary

Nom its a little hard She isnt a FEEL doll I said I never had a
feel one Mine hasnt any body just a soul But shes a great comfort

Robert appealed the ministers wife helplessly This was a case for
the ministera case of souls

Tell us some more about her Rebecca Mary the minister urged gently
But there was helplessness too in his eyes

Why thats all returned Rebecca Mary in surprise Of course I
cant dress her or undress her or take her out calling But its a great
comfort to rock her soul to sleep

Call Rhoda murmured the wife to the minister but Rhoda was already
there She volunteered prompt explanation There was no hesitation in
Rhodas face

She means a make believe doll Dont you Rebecca Mary

Yes Rebecca Mary assented thats her other name I suppose but I
never called her by it

What did you call her demanded practical Rhoda Whats her name
mean

Rhodahastily from the ministers wife This seemed like sacrilege
But Rhodas clear blue eyes were fixed upon Rebecca Mary she had not
heard her mothers warning little word

A shy color spread thinly over the lean little face of Rebecca Mary For
the space of a breath or two she hesitated

Her namesFelicia then softly

Robertthe children had gone out together the ministers wifes eyes
were unashamedly wetRobert I wish you were aa sheriff instead of
a minister Because I think I would make a better sheriffs wife Do you
know what I would make you do

The minister could guess

Id make you ARREST that woman Robert

Felicia But she saw willingness to be a sheriff come into his own
eyes and stop there briefly

Dont call me Felicia while I feel as wicked as this Oh Robert to
think she named her little souldoll after me

Its a beautiful name

Suddenly the wickedness was over She laughed unsteadily

It wouldnt be a good name for a sheriffs wife would it she said
So Ill stay by my own minister

One day close upon this time Aunt Olivia came abruptly upon Rebecca Mary
in the grape arbor She was sitting in her little rocking chair swaying
back and forth slowly She did not see Aunt Olivia What was she was
crooning half under her breath

 Oh hush oh hush my dollie
 Dont worry any more
 For Rebecca Mary n the angels
 Are watching oer
 Oer n oer n oer

The same words over and overgrowing perhaps a little softer and
tenderer Rebecca Marys arm was crooked as though a little flaxen head
lay in the bend of it Rebecca Marys brooding little face was gazing
downward intently at her empty arm Quite suddenly it came upon Aunt
Olivia that she had seen the child rocking like this beforethat she
must have seen her often

 Rebecca Mary n the angels
 Are watching oer

sang on the crooning little voice in Aunt Olivias ears

The doll in its coffin upstairs down here Rebecca Mary rocking her
empty arms The two thoughts flashed into Aunt Olivias mind and welded
into one All her vacillations and Dutys sharp reminders occurred
to her clearly She had thought that at last she was proof against
temptation but she had not thought of this She was not prepared for
Rebecca Mary here in her little rocking chair rocking her little
souldoll to sleep

The angels were used to watching oer but Aunt Olivia could not bear
it She went away with a strange unaccustomed ache in her throat The
ministers wife would not have wanted her arrested then

Aunt Olivia tiptoed away as though Rebecca Mary had said Sh She was
remembering as she went the brief sweet moment when she had sat like
that and rocked with the doll the ministers wife dressed in her arms
It seemed to establish a new link of kinship between her and Rebecca
Mary

She ran plump into Duty

Oh she gasped She was a little stunned Aunt Olivias Duty was
solid

I know where youve been I tried get there in time

Youre too late Aunt Olivia said firmly Dont stop me theres
something I must do before it gets too dark Its six oclock now

Wait commanded Duty Are you crazy You dont mean

Go back there and look at that childand hear what shes singing Stay
long enough to take it all indont hurry

But Duty barred her way grim and stern

Palely she put up both her hands and thrust it aside She did not once
look back at it

Already it was dusky under the guest chamber window She had to stoop
and peer and feel in the long tangle of grass She kept on patiently
with the Plummer kind of patience that never gave up She was eager and
smiling as though something pleasant were at the end of the peering and
stooping and feeling

Aunt Olivia was hunting for a key




The Plummer Kind



The dolls name was Olivicia

Rebecca Mary had evolved the name from her inner consciousness and her
intense gratitude to Aunt Olivia and the ministers wife She had put
Aunt Olivia first with instinctive loyalty though in the secret little
closet of her soul she had longed to call the beautiful being Felicia
intact and sweet She did not know the meaning of Felicia but she knew
that the doll as it lay in the loving cradle of her arms gazing upward
with changeless placidity and graciousness looked as one should look
whose name was Felicia Greater compliment than this Rebecca Mary could
not have paid the ministers wife

Olivicia she had placed the being on the sill of the attic window
stood confronting addressing it Olivicia its comingit is very
near to Sit there and listen and smileoh yes smile SMILE I dont
wonder I would too only Im too glad When youre TOO glad you cant
smile Ive been waiting for it to come Olivicia seems as if Id been
waiting a thousan years Youre so young youve only lived such little
while of course I dont expect you understand the deepdownness inside
o me when I think

The address fluttered and came to a standstill here Rebecca Mary was
suddenly minded that Olivicia was in the dark must be enlightened
before she could smile understandingly

Why you poor dearwhy you dont know what it is thats coming and
thats near to Its thecity Olivicia enlightened Rebecca Mary
gently to insure against shock Aunt Olivias goingtothecity

In Rebecca Marys dreamings it had always been THE city It did not need
local habitation and a name enough that it had streets upon streets
houses upon houses upon houses a dazzling swirl of men women and
little childrennoise glitter glory In her dreamings the city was
something so wondrous and grand that Heaven might have been its name
The streets upon streets were not paved with gold of courseof course
she knew they were not paved with gold But in spite of herself she knew
that she would be disappointed if they did not shine

Aunt Olivia had said it that morning At breakfastquite
matteroffactly Think of saying it matteroffactly

Im going to the city soon Rebecca Mary she had said between sips
of her tea Perhaps by Friday week but I havent set the day really
Theres a good deal to do

Rebecca Mary had been helping do it all day Now it was nearly time for
the pageant of red and gold in the west that Rebecca Mary loved and she
had come up here with the beautiful being to watch it through the tiny
panes of the attic window but more to ease the aching rapture in her
soul by speech She must say it out loud The citythe cityto the
city of streets and houses and men and wonders upon wonders

Olivicia had come in the capacity of calm listener for nothing excited
Olivicia

I Aunt Olivia had said but Aunt Olivia usually said I There was
no discouragement in that to Rebecca Mary It did not for a moment occur
to her that I did not mean we

The valise they had got down from its cobwebby niche was roomy it would
hold enough for two Rebecca Mary knew that because she had packed it
so many times in her dreamings She wished Aunt Olivia would let her
pack it now She knew just where she would put everythingher
best dress and Aunt Olivias for of course they would wear their
secondbests their best hats and shoes and gloves Their nightgowns
she would roll tightly and put in one end for it doesnt hurt
nightgowns to be rolled tightly Of course she would not put
anything heavy like hair brushes and shoes and things on top of
anythingunless it was the nightgowns for it doesnt hurt

Oh Oliviciaoh Olivicia how I hope shell say Rebecca Mary you
may pack the valise I could do it with my eyes shut Ive done it so
many many times

But Aunt Olivia did not say it One day and then another went by without
her saying it and then one morning Rebecca Mary knew by the plump
wellfed aspect of the valise that it was packed Aunt Olivia had packed
it in the night

There was no one else in the room when Rebecca Mary made her
disappointing little discovery She went over to the plump valise and
prodded it gently with her finger But it is so difficult to tell in
that way whether your own best dress your own best hat best shoes
best gloves are in there Rebecca Mary hurried upstairs and looked in
her closet and in her best bureau drawer

They were not there In her relief she caught up the beautiful being and
strained her hard lifeless little body to her own warm breast If she
had not been Rebecca Mary she would have danced about the room

Oh Im so relieved Olivicia she laughed softly If theyre not up
here THEYRE DOWN THERE Theyve got to be somewhere Theyre in that
valisevalisevaliiise

Rebecca Mary had never been to a city and within her remembrance Aunt
Olivia had never been Curiosity was not a Plummer trait hence Rebecca
Mary had never asked many questions about the remote period before her
own advent into Aunt Olivias life The same Plummer restraint kept her
now from asking questions There was nothing to do but wait but the
waiting was illumined by her joyous anticipations

Oddly enough Aunt Olivia seemed to have no anticipationsat least
joyous ones Her thin grave face may even have looked a little thinner
and graver IF Rebecca Mary had thought to notice

The night the lean old valise took on plumpness Aunt Olivia went often
into Marys little room Many of the times she came out very shortly
with the childs best things trailing from her arms but once or twice
she stayed rather longlong enough to stand beside a little white bed
and look down on a flushed little face A pair of wideopen eyes watched
her smilingly from the pillows but they were not Rebecca Marys eyes
and Olivicia was altogether trustworthy

An odd thing happenedbut Olivicia never told Why should she publish
abroad that she had lain there and seen Aunt Olivia bend oncebend
twiceover Rebecca Mary and kiss her

Softly patiently very wearily Aunt Olivia went in and out The things
she brought out in her arms she folded carefully and packed but not
in the lank old valise She put them all with tender painstaking into a
quaint little carpetbag When the work was done she set the bag away out
of sight and went about packing her own things in the old valise

The day before she had been to see the minister and the ministers
wife She called for them both and sat down gravely and made her
proposition It was startling only because of the few words it took
to make it Otherwise it was very pleasant and the minister and the
ministers wife received it with nods and smiles

Of course Miss Oliviawhy certainly smiled and nodded the
minister

Why it will be delightfuland Rhoda will be so pleased nodded and
smiled the ministers wife But after their caller had gone she faced
the minister with indignant eyes

Why did you let her she demanded Why did you spoil it all by that

Because she was Miss Olivia he answered gently

Yesyes I suppose so reluctantly but anyway you neednt have
let her do it in advance Actually it made me blush Robert

The minister rubbed his cheeks tentatively Made me too he admitted
but I respect Miss Olivia so much

The ministers wife tacked abruptly to her other source of indignation

Why doesnt she TAKE Rebecca Mary Robert wait You know it isnt
becauseYou know better

It isnt because dearI know better he hurried assuringly The
minister was used to her little indignations and loved them for being
hers They were harmless too and wont to have a good excuse for being
This one nowthe minister in his heart wondered that Miss Olivia did
not take Rebecca Mary

It would be such a treat Robert you think what a treat it would be to
Rebecca Mary

Still dear

I dont want to be still I want Rebecca Mary to have that treat But
she kissed him in token of being willing to drop it thereit was her
usual tokenand ran away to get a little room ready There was not a
device known to the ministers wife that she did not use to make that
room pleasant

Shall I take your pincushion Rhoda Rhoda had come up to help

Yes eagerly and Ill write Welcome with the pins

And the little fan to put on the wallthe pink one

Yes yes let me spread it out mamma

Thats grand Now if we only had a pink quilt

I only have one laughed Rhoda hurrying after it

The whole little room when they left like the pins in the pincushion
spelled WELCOME

Aunt Olivia got up earlier than usual one day and went about the house
for a survey The valise and the little carpetbag she carried downstairs
and out on to the front steps Her face was whitened as if by a long
nights vigil When she called Rebecca Mary it was with a voice strained
hoarse The beautiful being Olivicia watched her with intent unwinking
gaze Could it be Olivicia understood

Hurry and dress Rebecca Mary theres a good deal to do Aunt Olivia
said at the door She did not go in Yes in your secondbestdont
you see Ive put it out You can wear that every day now tillfor a
while Something in the voice startled Rebecca Mary out of her subdued
ecstasy and sent her down to breakfast with a nameless fear tugging at
her heart

Youre going to stay at the ministersIve paid your board in
advance Aunt Olivia said monotonously as if it were her lesson She
did not look at Rebecca Mary Ive put in your longsleeve aprons so
you can help do up the dishes Theres plenty of handkerchiefs to last
You mustnt forget your rubbers when its wet or to make up your bed
yourself I dont want you to make the ministers wife any more trouble
than you can help

The lesson went monotonously on but Rebecca Mary scarcely heard She
had heard the first sentenceher sentence poor child Youre going to
stay at the ministersstay at the ministersstay at the ministers
It said itself over and over again in her ears In her need for somebody
to lean on her startled gaze sought the beautiful being across the room
in agonized appeal

But Olivicia was staring smilingly at Aunt Olivia ET TU OLIVICIA

If Rebecca Mary had noticed there was an appealing wistful look in
Aunt Olivias eyes too in odd contrast to the firm lips that moved
steadily on with their lesson

You can walk to school with Rhoda youll enjoy that Youve never had
folks to walk with And you can stay with her only you mustnt forget
your stents Ive put in some towels to hem Maybe the ministers wife
has got something if so hem hers first Youll be like one o the
family and theyre nice folks but I want you to keep right on being a
Plummer

Years afterwards Rebecca Mary remembered the dizzy dance of the bottles
in the casterthey seemed to join hands and sway and swing about their
silver circlet and how Aunt Olivias buttons marched and countermarched
up and down Aunt Olivias alpaca dress She did not look above the
buttonsshe did not dare to If she was to keep right on being a
Plummer she must not cry

Thats all she heard through the daze and dizziness except that
I cant tell when Ill be back Itaint decided Likely I shant be
ablethere wont be much chance to write and you neednt expect me to
No need to write me either Thats all I guess

The stage that came for Aunt Olivia dropped the little carpetbag and
Rebecca Mary at the ministers In the brief interval between the start
and the dropping Rebecca Mary sat stiff and numb on the edge of the
high seat and gazed out unfamiliarly at the familiar landmarks they
lurched past At any other time the knowledge that she was going to the
ministers to stayto livewould have filled her with staid joy At
any other timebut THIS time only a dull ache filled her little dreary
world Everything seemed to achethe munching cows in the Trumbull
pasture the cats on the doorsteps the dog loping along beside the
stage the stage drivers stooping old back Aunt Olivia was going to
the cityRebecca Mary wasnt going to the city There was no room in
the world for anything but that and the ache

Rebecca Marys indignation was not born till night Then lying in the
dainty bed under Rhodas pink quilt her mood changed Until then she
had only been disappointed But then she sat up suddenly and said bitter
things about Aunt Olivia

Shes gone to have a good time all to herselfand she might have taken
me She didnt she didnt and she mightve She wanted all the good
time herself She didnt want me to have any

Rebecca Marydid you speak dear It was the gentle voice of the
ministers wife outside the door Rebecca Marys red little hands
unwrung and dropped on the pink quilt

Nom I didI mean yesm I didntI mean

You dont feel sick There isnt anything the matter dear

Nomoh yesm yesm for there was something the matter It was
Aunt Olivia But she must not say itmust not crymust keep right on
being a Plummer

Robert I didnt go inI couldnt the ministers wife said back
in the cheery sitting room I suppose you think Id have gone in and
comforted her taken her right in my arms and comforted her the Rhoda
way but I didnt

No The ministers voice was a little vague on account of the sermon
on his knees

I seemed to knowsomething told me right through that doorthat shed
rather I wouldnt Robert if the child is homesick its a different
kind of homesickness

The Plummer kind he suggested The minister was coming to

Yes the Plummer kind I suppose Plummers are suchsuch PLUMMERY
persons Robert

Upstairs under the pink quilt the rigid little figure relaxed just
enough to admit of getting out of bed and fumbling in the little
carpetbag With her diary in her handfor Aunt Olivia had remembered
her diaryRebecca Mary went to the window and sat down She had to
hold the cookbook up at a painful angle and peer at it sharply for the
moonlight that filtered into the little room through the vines was dim
and soft

Aunt Olivia has gone to the city and I havent painfully traced
Rebecca Mary She wanted the good time all to herself I shall never
forgive Aunt Olivia the Lord have mercy on her Then Rebecca Mary
went back to bed She dreamed that the cars ran off the track and they
brought Aunt Olivias pieces home to her In the dreadful dream she
forgave Aunt Olivia

It was very pleasant at the ministers and the ministers wifes
Rebecca Mary felt the warmth and pleasantness of it in every fibre of
her body and soul But she was not happy nor warm She thought it was
indignation against Aunt Oliviashe did not know she was homesick She
did not know why she went to the old home every day after school and
wandered through Aunt Olivias flower garden and sat with little brown
chin palmdeep on the doorsteps Gradually the indignation melted out of
existence and only the homesickness was left It sat on her small lean
face like a little spectre It troubled the ministers wife

What can we do Robert she asked

What he echoed for the minister too was troubled

She wanders about like a little lost soul When she plays with the
children its only the outside of her that plays

Only the outside he nodded

Last night I went in Robert andand tried the Rhoda way I think
she liked it but it didnt comfort her I am sure now that it is
homesickness Robert They were both sure but the grim little spectre
sat on undaunted by all their kindnesses

When thy father and thy mother forsake the wrote Rebecca Mary in the
cookbook diary and thy Aunt Olivia for I know it means and thy Aunt
Olivia then the Lord will take the up but I dont feal as if anyboddy
had taken me up The ministers wife did once but of course she had to
put me down again rite away She is a beutiful person and I love her but
she is differunt from thy father and thy mother and thy Aunt Olivia Ide
rather have Aunt Olivia take me up than to have the Lord

It was when she shut the battered little book this time that Rebecca
Mary remembered one or two things that had happened the morning Aunt
Olivia went away It was queer how she HADNT remembered them before

She remembered that Aunt Olivia had taken her sharp little face between
her own hands and looked down wistfully at itwistfully Rebecca Mary
remembered now though she did not call it by that name She remembered
Aunt Olivia had said You neednt hem anything unless its for the
ministers wifenever mind the towels I put in That was almost the
last thing she had said She had put her head out of the stage door to
say it Rebecca Mary had hemmed a towel each day There were but two
left and she resolved to hem both of those tomorrow A sudden little
longing was born within her for more towels to hem for Aunt Olivia

It was nearly three weeks after Rebecca Marys entrance into the
ministers family when the letter came It was directed to Rebecca Mary
and lay on her plate when she came home from school

Oh look youve got a letter Rebecca Mary heralded Rhoda joyfully
Then her face fell for maybe the letter would say Aunt Olivia was
coming home

Is it from your aunt Olivia she asked anxiously

No Rebecca Mary said in slow surprise The writing isnt anyway
and the name is another one

Oh Oh Maybe shes got mar

Rhoda cautioned the minister

This is the letter Rebecca Mary read

Dear Rebecca MaryYou see I know your name from your aunt She talked
about you all the time but I am writing you of my own accord She does
not know it I think you will like to know that at last we are feeling
very hopeful about your aunt We have been very anxious since the
operation she had so little strength to rally with But now if she
keeps on as well as this you will have her home again in a little while
The doctors say three weeks She is the patientest patient in the ward
Yours very truly Sara Ellen Nesbitt Nurse Ward A Emmons Hospital

That was the letter Rebecca Marys face grew a little whiter at every
line of it At every line understanding grew clearer till at the end
she knew it all She gave a little cry and ran out of the room Love
and remorse and sympathy fought for first place in her laboring little
breast In the next few minutes she lived so long a time and thought so
many thoughts But above everything else towered joy that Aunt Olivia
was coming home

Rebecca Marys eyes blazed with pride at being a Plummer This kind of
courage was the Plummer kind The childs lank little figure seemed to
grow taller and straighter She held up her head splendidly and exulted
She felt like going up on the ministers housetop and proclaiming
Shes my aunt Olivia Shes mine Shes mineIm a Plummer too All
o you listen shes my aunt Olivia and shes coming home

Suddenly the child flung out her arms towards the south where Aunt
Olivia was And though she stood quite still something within her
seemed to spring away and go hurrying through the clear air

I shouldnt suppose Aunt Olivia would ever forgive me but shes Aunt
Olivia and she will wrote Rebecca Mary that night her small dark
face full of a solemn peaceit seemed so long since she had been full
of peace before She wrote on eagerly

When she gets home Ime going to hug her I cant help it if it wont be
keeping right on




Article Seven



Rebecca Mary measured them Against the woodshed wall with chalkit
was not altogether an easy thing to do The result startled her With
rather unsteady little fingers she measured from chalk mark to floor
again to make sure it was as bad as that It was even a little worse

Oh sighed Rebecca Mary to think they belong to meto think theyre
hitched on She gazed down at them with scorn and was ashamed of them
She tried to conceal their length with her brief skirts but when she
straightened up there they were again as long as ever She sat down
suddenly on the shed floor and drew them up underneath her That was
temporarily a relief If I sit here world without end nobodyll see
em grimly smiled Rebecca Mary

It was her legs Rebecca Mary measured against the woodshed wall It was
her legs she was ashamed of No wonder the ministers wife had said
to the minister going home from meeting with Rebecca Mary behind them
unawaresno wonder she had said Robert HAVE you noticed Rebecca
Marys legs

Rebecca Mary had not heard the reply of the minister for of course she
had gone away then If she had stayed she would have heard him say with
exaggerated prudery Felicia My dear Were you alluding to Rebecca
Marys limbs for the minister wickedly remembered inadvertent
occasions when he himself had called legs legs

LEGS the ministers wife repeated calmlyRebecca Marys are too
long for limbs Robert that child will grow up one of these days

They all do sighed the minister Its human nature dear Youll be
telling me next that theres something the matter with Rhodaslegs

The ministers wife gazed thoughtfully ahead at a little trio fast
approaching the vanishing point Her eyes grew a little wistful

There is now perhaps but I havent noticedI wont look she
murmured And anyway Robert Rhoda will give us a little time to get
used to it in But Rebecca Mary isnt the Rhoda kindI dont believe
Rebecca Mary will give us even three days of grace

I always supposed Rebecca Mary was born that waygrown up the
minister remarked tucking a gloved hand comfortably close under his
arm I wouldnt let it worry me dear

Oh I dontnot worry really she said smilingonly her legs
startled me a little today If she were mine I should let her dresses
down

If she were Rhod

She isnt shes Rebecca Mary Probably if I were Miss Olivia I would
let Rhodas down And she knew she would

Rebecca Mary on the woodshed floor sat and thought deepdown thoughts
Her eyes were fixed dreamily on a big knothole before her and the
thoughts seemed to come out of it and stand before her demanding
imperiously to be thought One after anothera relentless procession

Think me the first one had commanded Im the Thought of Growing
Up I saw you measuring your legs and I concluded it was time for me to
introduce myself I had to come some time didnt I

Oh yes breathed Rebecca Mary sadly I dont suppose I could expect
you to stay in there always butbut Im not very glad to see you You
neednt have come so SUDDEN she added with gentle resentment

The Thought of Growing Up crept into her mind and nestled down there As
thoughts go it was not an unkind one

Youll get used to me sometime and like me it said comfortingly But
Rebecca Mary knew better She drove it out

Why must legs keep on growing and unwelcome Thoughts come out of
knotholes Why could not little girls keep on sewing stents and learning
arithmetic and carrying beautiful dollbeings to bed Why had the Lord
created little girls like thisthis growing kind

If I had made the world began Rebecca Marybut stopped in a hurry
The irreverence of presuming to make a better world than the Lord shamed
her

I suppose He knew best but if Hed ever been a little girl This was
worse than the other Rebecca Mary hastily dismissed the world and its
Maker from her musings for fear of further irreverences

One Thought came out of the knothole illustrated It was leading a tall
womangirl by the handno it was pushing it as though the womangirl
were loath to come

Come along urged the new Thought laughingly Here she isthis is
Rebecca Mary Rebecca Mary this is YOU You neednt be afraid of each
other you two Take a good long look and get acquainted

The womangirl was tall and straight She had Rebecca Marys hair
Rebecca Marys eyes mouth little pointed chin But not Rebecca Marys
legsunless the long skirts covered them She was rather comely and
pleasant to look at But Rebecca Mary tried not to look

Shes got a loversome day shell be getting married the new
Thought said more abruptly startlingly than grammatically And then
with a little muffled cry Rebecca Mary put out her hands and pushed
the womangirl awayback into the knothole whence she had come The
Thought too for she had no room in her mind for thoughts like that

My aunt Olivia wouldnt allow me to think of you she explained in
dismissing them And with dignity she added neither would Rebecca
Mary

It was to be as the ministers wife had prophesiedthere were to be not
even the three days of grace allowed by law when Rebecca Mary grew up
Sitting there with her legs her poor little unappreciated legs the
innocent cause of the whole trouble curled out of sight Rebecca Mary
planned that there should be but one day of grace She would allow one
day more to be a little girl in and then she would grow up But that
one dayRebecca Mary got up hastily and went to find Aunt Olivia

Aunt Olivia she began without preambleRebecca Mary never
preambledAunt Olivia may I have a holiday tomorrow

Aunt Olivia was rocking in her easy chair on the porch It had taken her
sixtytwo years to learn to sit in an easy chair and rock Even now and
she had been home from the hospital many months she felt a little
as though the friendly birds that perched on the porch railing were
twittering tauntingly Plummer Plummer Plummerrocking in an easy
chair

May I Aunt Olivia It was an unusual occurrence for Rebecca Mary to
ask again so soon But this was an unusual occurrence Aunt Olivias
thin face turned affectionately towards the child

School doesnt begin again tomorrow does it she said in surprise
Werent all Rebecca Marys days now holidays

Oh nonom But I mean may I skip my stents Andand may I soak the
kettles and pans Just tomorrow

Just tomorrow repeated bewildered Aunt Oliviasoak yourstents

Because its going to be a pretty busy day Its going to be aa
celebration Rebecca Mary said softly There was a strangely exalted
look on her face Oddly enough she was not afraid that Aunt Olivia would
say no

Aunt Olivia said yes She did not ask any questions about the
celebration on account of the exalted look She could wait But the
bewildered look stayed for a while on her thin face Rebecca Mary was
a queer child a queer childbut she was a dear child Dearness atoned
for queerness in Aunt Olivias creed

The celebration began early the next morning before Aunt Olivia was up
She lay in bed and heard it begin Rebecca Mary out in the dewy garden
was singing at the top of her voice Aunt Olivia had never heard her
sing like that beforenot at the top Her sweet shrill voice sounded
rather unacquainted with such free heights as that and the woman in the
bed wondered with a staid little smile if it did not make Rebecca Mary
feel as she felt when she sat in the easy chair rocking

Rebecca Mary sang hymns mostly but interspersed in her programme were
bits of Mother Goose set to original tunesshe had learned the Mother
Goose of the ministers Littlest Little Boyand original bits set to
familiar tunes It was a wild little orgy of song

My grief Aunt Olivia ejaculated under her breath but she did not
mean her grief Other people might think Rebecca Mary was crazynot
Aunt Olivia But yet she wondered a little and found it hard to wait

Rebecca Mary washed the breakfast cup and plates but put the pans and
kettles to soak and hurried away to her play There was so much playing
to be done before the sun set on her opportunity She had made a little
programme on a slip of paper with approximate times allotted to each
item As

 Tree climbing 1 hr
 Do not tare anything
 Mud pies 1 hr and 12
 Do not get anything muddy
 Tea party 2 hrs
 Do not break anything
 Skipping 12 hr

Rebecca Mary had written 1 hr at first opposite skipping but it had
rather appalled her to think of skipping for so long a period of time
and with a sense of being already out of breath she had hurriedly
erased the 1 and substituted 12 Underneath she had written Do not
tip over anything All the items had cautionary parentheses
underneath them for Rebecca Mary did not wish the celebration to injure
anything Not this last day when all the days of all the years before
it that had gone to make up her little girlhood nothing had been torn
or muddied or tipped over

Rebecca Mary had never climbed trees had never made mud pies never had
tea parties nor skipped It was with rather a hesitating step that she
went forward to meet them all She was even a little awed But she went
No item on her programme was omitted

From her rocker on the porch Aunt Olivia watched proceedings with quiet
patience It was a good vantage pointshe could see nearly all of the
celebration The tree Rebecca Mary climbed was on the edge of the old
orchard next to Aunt Olivia and there was a providential little rift
through the shrubbery and vines that intervened This part of the
programme she could see almost too clearly for it must be confessed
that this part startled Aunt Olivia out of her calm Itit was so
unexpected She stopped rocking and leaned forward in her chair to peer
more sharply What was the childShes climbing a tree breathed Aunt
Olivia in undisguised astonishment Even as she breathed it there came
to her faintly the snapping of twigs and flutter of leaves Then all was
quite still but she could discern with her pair of trusty Plummer eyes
two long legs gently dangling

If Aunt Olivia had known Rebecca Mary too was startled Itit was so
strange an experience She was not in the least afraidit was a mental
start rather than a physical one When she had reached the limb set down
in her programme she sat on it in a little daze of bewildered delight
She liked it

Why why its nice Rebecca Mary breathed Her turn had come for
undisguised astonishment The leaves all about her nodded to her and
stroked her cheeks and hair and hands They whispered things into her
ears They were such friendly little leaves

Nothing looked quite the same up there It was a little as if she were
in a new world and she felt odd thrills of pride as probably people
who had discovered countries and rivers and north poles felt Through
a rift in the leaves she could see with her good Plummer eyes a swaying
spot of brown and white that was Aunt Olivia rocking Suddenly
Rebecca Mary experienced a pang of remorse that she had wasted so many
opportunities like thisthat this was her only one She wished she had
put 2 hrs instead of 1 hr over against Tree climbing but it was too
late now She had borrowed Aunt Olivias openfaced gold watch to serve
as timekeeper and promptly at the expiration of the 1 hr she slid down
through the crackling twigs and friendly leaves to the old world below
She did not allow herself to look back but she could not help the sigh
It was going to be harder to grow up than she had thought it would be

The mud pies she made with conscientious care as Rhoda the ministers
little girl had said she used to make them She made rows and rows of
them and set them in the sun to bake There were raisin stones in them
all and crimped edges around them It did not take nearly all the 1 hr
and 12 so she made another and still another batch When the time was
up she did not sigh but she had had rather a good time How many mud
pies she HADNT made in all those years that were to end today

Olivicia and the little white cat went to the tea party Rebecca Mary
thought of inviting Aunt Oliviashe got as far as the porch steps
but no farther She caught a glimpse of her own legs and shrank back
sensitively They seemed to have grown since she measured them against
the woodshed wall Rebecca Mary felt the contrast between her legs and
the tea party Aunt Olivia never knew how near she had come to being
invited to take part in the celebration at Article III on the
programme

Rhoda had had tea parties unnumbered like the sands of the sea She had
described them fluently so Rebecca Mary was not as one in the dark She
knew how to cut the bread and the cake into tiny dice and the cookies
into tiny rounds She knew how to make the cambric tea and to arrange
the jelly and flowers But Rhoda had forgotten to tell her how to make a
rose piehow to select two large rose leaves for upper and under crust
and to fill in the pie between them with pink and white rose petals and
sugar in alternate layers Press until done Why had Rhoda forgotten
It seemed a pity that there was no rose pie at Rebecca Marys tea
partyand no time left to make one

Will you take sugar in your tea Olivicia Rebecca Mary asked shyly
She sat on the ground with her legs drawn under her out of sight but
there were little warm spots in her cheeks She had not expected to
beashamed If there had been a knothole anywhere she thought to
herself the Thought of Growing Up would have come out of it and
confronted her and reminded her of her legs

Will you help yourself to the bread Wont you have another cookie
She left nothing out and gradually the strangeness wore away It got
gradually to be a good time How many tea parties thought Rebecca
Mary there might have been

Rebecca Mary was skipping when the ministers wife came to call on Aunt
Olivia It was the ministers wife who discovered it Aunt Olivia
caught the indrawing of her breath and saw her face Then Aunt Olivia
discovered it and a delicate color overspread her thin cheeks and rose
to her temples Now what was the child

Rhoda is a great skipper the ministers wife said hurriedly But it
was the wrong thingshe knew it was the wrong thing

Rebecca Mary is having acelebration hurried Aunt Olivia but she
wished she had not for it seemed like trying to excuse Rebecca Mary
She too had said the wrong thing

How pleasant it is out here tried again the ministers wife

Yes its cool Aunt Olivia agreed gratefully After that the things
they said were right things The fantastic little figure down there in
the orchard skipping wildly determinedly was in none of them Both
of them felt it to be safer But the ministers wifes gaze dwelt on the
skipping figure and followed it through its amazing mazes in spite of
the ministers wife

I couldnt have helped it Robert she said Not if youd been there
preaching Thou shalt not to me You would have looked too while you
were preaching You cant imagine sitting there at that desk what the
temptation wasRobert you dont suppose Rebecca Mary has gone crazy

Felicia You frighten me

No _I_ dont suppose either But it was certainly very strange It was
almost ALARMING Robert And she didnt know how at all I wanted to go
down and show her

It seems to methe minister spoke impressively that it is not
Rebecca Mary who has gone crazy

Why the idea Havent I made it plain laughed she Ill speak in A
B Cs then Rebecca Mary was SKIPPING Robertskipping skipping

Then its Rebecca Mary the minister murmured

Thats what Im afraiddidnt I say so Or else its her second
childhood

First you mean If THATS it dont lets say a word deardont
breathe Felicia for fear well stop it

Dear child the ministers wife said tenderly I wish Id gone down
there and shown her how And Id have told herRobert Id have told
her how to climb a tree Dont tell the parish

The day was to end at sunset from sunrise to sunset Rebecca Mary had
decreed The last article on her crumpled little programme was Saying
Goodby to OliviciaDont cry It was going to be the most difficult
thing of all the articles Olivicia had existed so short a time
comparativelyit might not have been as difficult if there had always
been an Olivicia Or it might have been harder Rebecca Mary said She
went towards that article with reluctant feet But it had to come

The bureau drawer was all ready Rebecca Mary had lined it with
something white and soft and sweetened it with dried rose petals spiced
in the centuryold Plummer way It bore rather grewsome resemblance to
Olivicias coffin but it was not grewsome to Rebecca Mary She laid the
doll in it with the tender little swinging motion mothers use in laying
down their tiny sleepers

There there there crooned Rebecca Mary softly brooding over the
beautiful being Youll rest there sweetly after your mother is grown
up And youll try not to miss her wont you Youll understand
Oliviciaoh Olivicia But she did not cry Her eyes were very
bright For several minutes she stood there stooped over painfully
gazing down into the cofthe bureau drawer wherein lay peaceful
Olivicia She was saying goodbye in her heartshe never said it aloud

Dear very softly indeed you are sure you understand Everybody has
to grow up dear Itit hurts but you have to I mean IVE got to
I wouldnt so soon if it wasnt for my legs But they keep right on
growingtheyre awful dearI cant stop em Olivicia lie right
there and be thankful youre a doll But I wish you could open your eyes
and look at me just once more

Rebecca Mary shut the drawer gently It was overno she would say one
thing more to the beautiful being in there She bent to the keyhole

Olivicia she called in a tender whisper I shall be right here
nights We shant be far away from each other

But it would not be like lying in each others armsoh not at all like
that Rebecca Mary caught her breath it was perilously like a sob Then
she girded up her loins and went away to meet her fatethe common fate
of all

She was very tired The day had been a strain upon her that was
beginning now to tell To put all ones childhood into one daythat is
not easy

Article VI was the last In a way it was a rest to Rebecca Mary for
it entailed merely a visit to the woodshed She could sit quietly on the
floor opposite the knothole and wait for the Thoughts If the Thought of
Growing Up came out tonight she would say Oh well you may stayyou
neednt go back Im not any glad to see you but Im ready I suppose I
shall get used to you

What Thoughts came out of the knothole to Rebecca Mary she never told
to any one It was nearly dark when she went away planting her feet
firmly holding her head straightRebecca Mary Plummer She went to
find Aunt Olivia and tell her On the way she stopped to get
Aunt Olivias shawl for it was getting chilly out on the porch
Significantly the first thing Rebecca Mary did after she began to grow
up was to get the shawl and lay it over Aunt Olivias spare shoulders
The second thing was to bend to the scant gray hair and lightly rub it
with her cheek It was a Rebecca Mary kiss

Out in front of the rocking chair still straight and firm she told
Aunt Olivia

Its overI think I put everything in she said I thought you ought
to know so I came to tell you Im ready to grow up

After all if Rebecca Mary had known her programme had not ended
with Article VI Here was another Take the pencil in your steady little
fingers Rebecca Mary and write

Article VIIGrowing up Do not break Aunt Olivias heart




UnPlummered



Aunt Olivia sighed It was the third time since she had begun to let
Rebecca Mary down The third sigh was the longest one Oh this letting
down of children who would grow up

I wont do it Aunt Olivia rebelled fiercely but she took up her
scissors again at Dutys nudge

You dont want people laughing at her do you Duty said sensibly
Well then rip out that hem and face up that skirt and stop sighing
What cant be cured must be endur

Im ripping it out Aunt Olivia interrupted crisply But Duty was not
to be silenced

You ought to have done it before dictatorially Youve known all
along that Rebecca Mary was growing up

Aunt Olivia like the proverbial worm turned

I didnt know till Rebecca Mary told me she retorted then the
rebellion died out of her thin face and tenderness came and took its
place Aunt Olivia was thinking of the time when Rebecca Mary told her
She gazed past Duty past the skirt across her knees out through the
porch vines and saw Rebecca Mary coming to tell her She saw the shawl
the child was bringing felt it laid on her shoulders and something
else laid on her hair soft and smooth like a little lean brown cheek
The memory was so pleasant that Aunt Olivia closed her eyes to make it
stay When she opened them some one was coming along the path but it
was not Rebecca Mary

Good afternoon some one said Aunt Olivia stiffened into a Plummer
again with hurried embarrassment She did not recognize the voice nor
the pleasant young face that followed it through the vines

Its Rebecca Marys aunt isnt it The stranger smiled I should
know it by the family resemblance

Were both Plummers Aunt Olivia answered gravely Wont you come up
on the porch and take a seat

No Ill sit down here on the stepsId rather I think Ill sit
on the lowest step for Ive come on a very humble errand Im Rebecca
Marys teacher

Oh It was all Aunt Olivia could manage for a sudden horror had
come upon her She had a distinct remembrance of being at the Tony
Trumbullses when the school teacher came to call

Itsits rather hard to say it The young person on the lowest step
laughed nervously Id a good deal rather not But I think so much of
Rebecca Mary

The horror grew in Aunt Olivias soul It was something terribly like
that the Tony Trumbullses teacher had said And like this

It hurtsthere But I made up my mind it was my duty to come up here
and say it and so Ive come Im sorry to have to say

Dont ejaculated Aunt Olivia trembling on her Plummer pedestal For
she was laboring with the impulse to refuse to listen to this intruder
to drive her awayto say I wont believe a word you say You may as
well go home

Hoitytoity breathed Duty in her ear It saved her

Well she said gently Go on

Im sorry to say I cant teach Rebecca Mary any more Miss Plummer
Thats what I came to tell you

This was awfulawful But hot rebellion rose in Aunt Olivias heart
There was some mistakeit was some other Rebecca Mary this person
meant She would never believe it was HERSthe Plummer one

Because Ive taught her all I know There Do you wonder I chose the
lowest step to sit on But its the truth honest the little teacher
laughed girlishly but there were shame spots on her cheeksRebecca
Mary is the smartest scholar Ive got and Ive taught her all I know
In her voice there was confession to having taught Rebecca Mary a little
more than that The shame spots flickered in a halo of humble honesty

Shes been from Percentage through the arithmetic four timesRebecca
Marys splendid in arithmetic And she knows the geography and grammar
by heart

The look on Aunt Olivias face The transition from horror to pride was
overwhelming transfiguring

Rebecca Marys smart added the honest one on the doorstep _I_ think
she ought to have a chance There Thats all I came for so Ill
be going Only I dont supposeyou dont think youll have to tell
Rebecca Mary do you Aboutabout me I mean

No I dont Aunt Olivia assured her warmly Her thin lined hand met
and held for a moment the small plump onelong enough to say Youre
a good girlI like you in its own way The little teacher went away
in some sort comforted for having taught Rebecca Mary all she knew
She even hummed a relieved little tune on her way home because of the
pleasant tingle in the hand that Rebecca Marys aunt had squeezed After
all no matter how much you dreaded doing it it was better to tell the
truth

Aunt Olivia hummed no relieved little tune The pride in her heart
battled with the Dread there and went down Aunt Olivia did not call the
Dread by any other name It was Duty who dared

Confronting Aunt Olivia I suppose you know what it means I suppose
you know it means youve got to give Rebecca Mary a chance When are you
going to send her away to school

Ohdont pleaded Aunt Olivia You dont give me any time Theres
no need of hurry

Im still a Plummer if youre not broke in Duty with ironic
sharpness The Plummers were never afraid to look their duty in the
face

ImIm looking at you groaned Aunt Olivia climbing painfully back
on to her pedestal Go ahead and say it Im readyonly I guess youve
forgot how long Ive had Rebecca Mary When youve brought a child up

I brought her up myself calmly I ought to know She wouldnt have
been Rebecca Mary would she if I hadnt been right on hand Who was
it taught her to sew patchwork before she was four years old And make
sheetsand bedsand bread Who was it kept her from being a little
tomboy like the ministers girl Who taught her to walk instead of run
and eat with her fork and be a lady Who was it

Oh youyou sighed Aunt Olivia trembling for her balance You did
em all I never couldve alone

ThenDuty was justly complacentThen perhaps youll be willing to
leave Rebecca Marys going away to school to me She must go at once as
soon as you can get her read

Aunt Olivia tumbled off She did not wait to pick herself up before she
turned upon this Duty that delighted in torturing her

You better get her ready yourself You better let her down and make her
some nightgowns and count her pockethandkerchiefs You think you can do
anythingno IM talking now I guess its my turn I guess Ive waited
long enough Maybe you brought Rebecca Mary up but Im not going to
leave it to you whether shed ought to go away to school Shes my
Rebecca Mary isnt she Well Its me that loves her isnt itnot
you If I cant love her and stay a Plummer then Illlove her Im
going to leave it to the minister

The minister was a little embarrassed The wistful look in Aunt Olivias
eyes said Say no so plainly And he knew he must say yesthe
ministers Duty was imperative too

If she cant get any more good out of the school here he began

She cant said Aunt Olivias Duty for her The teacher says she
cant Rebecca Marys smart Then Duty too was proud of Rebecca Mary

I know she is said the minister heartily My Rhodayou ought to
hear my Rhoda set her up She thinks Rebecca Mary knows more than the
teacher does

Rhodas smart too breathed Duty in Aunt Olivias ear

So you see dear Miss Olivia the child would make good use of any
advantage

You mean I ought to send her away Well Im ready toI said Id leave
it to you Where shall I send her If there was onlyI dont suppose
theres some place near to Children go home Friday nights sometimes
dont they

There is no school near enough for that Im afraid the minister
said gently He could not bear the look in Miss Olivias eyes

It hurt he told his wife afterwards I wish she hadnt asked me
Felicia

I know dear but its the penalty of being a minister Ministers
hearts ought to be coated withwith asbestos or something so the looks
in peoples eyes wouldnt burn through Im glad she didnt ask ME

It will nearly kill them both ran on the ministers thoughts aloud
You know how it was when Miss Olivia was at the hospital

Robertthe ministers wifes tone was reproachfulyoure talking
in the future tense You said will Then you advised her to send
Rebecca Mary away

Guilty pleaded the minister What else could I do

You could have offered to teach her yourselfwith prompt inspiration
Oh Robert why didnt you

Feliciamy dearfor the minister was modest

You know plenty for two Rebecca Marys she triumphed Didnt you
appropriate all the honors at college you selfish boy

Its too late now dear But the ministers eyes thanked her and the
big clasp of his arms A minister may be mortal

Maybe it is and maybe it isnt spoke the ministers wife in riddles
Well wait and see

But Feliciabut dear theyre both them Plummers

Maybe they are and maybe they arent laughed she

That night Aunt Olivia told Rebecca Maryafter she went to bed quite
calmly

Rebecca Mary how would you like to go away to school For Im going to
send you my dear

Awayto schoolmy dear echoed Rebecca Mary sitting upright in
bed Her slight figure stretched up rigid and preternaturally tall in
the dim light

Yes the minister advises itI left it to him He thinks you ought to
have advantages Aunt Olivia slipped down suddenly beside the little
rigid figure and touched it rather timidly She felt a little in awe of
the Rebecca Mary who knew more than her teacher did

They all seem to think youresmart my dear Aunt Olivia said and
she would scarcely have believed it could be so hard to say it For the
life of her she could not keep the pride from pricking through her tone
The wild temptation to sell her Plummer birthright for a kiss assailed
her But she groped in the dimness for Dutys cool touch and found it
In the Plummer code of laws it was writ Thou shalt not kiss

Im going right to work to make you some new nightgowns Aunt Olivia
added hastily I think I shall make them plain for it was in the
nature of a reinforcement to her courage to leave off the ruffles

Rebecca Marys eyes shone like stars in the dark little room The child
thought she was glad to be going away to school

Shall I study algebra and Latin she demanded

I suppose sothatll be what you go for

And Frenchnot FRENCH

Likely

Rebecca Mary fell back on the pillows to grasp it But she was presently
up again

And that thing that tells about the air andand gassy things And the
one that tells about your bones

Aunt Olivia did not recognize chemistry but she knew bones She sighed
gently

Oh yes I suppose youll find out just how youre put together and
likely itll scare you so you wont ever dare to breathe deep again
Maybe learning like that is importantI suppose the minister knows

The minister knows everything Rebecca Mary said solemnly If you
let me go away to school Ill try to learn to know as much as he does
Aunt Olivia You dontyou dont think hed mind do you

In the dark Aunt Olivia smiled The small person there on the pillows
was after all a child Rebecca Mary had not grown up after all

He wont mind promised Aunt Olivia for the minister She went
away presently and cut out Rebecca Marys new nightgowns She sat and
stitched them far into the night and stitched her sad little bodings
in one by one Already desolation gripped Aunt Olivias heart

Rebecca Marys dreams that night were marvelous ones She dreamed she
saw herself in a glass after she had learned all the things there were
to learn and she looked like the minister When she spoke her voice
sounded deep and sweet like the ministers voice Somewhere a voice like
the ministers wifes seemed to be calling Robert Robert

Yes answered Rebecca Mary and woke up

There were many preparations to make The days sped by busily and to
Rebecca Mary full of joyous expectancy Aunt Olivia made no moan She
worked steadily over the plain little outfit and thrust her Dreads away
with resolute courage to wait until Rebecca Mary was gone Time enough
then

Youre doing rightthat ought to comfort you encouraged Duty
kindly

Clear out was what Aunt Olivia cried out sharply in answer Youve
done enoughthis is all your work Dont stand there hugging yourself
YOURE not going to miss Rebecca Mary

I shall miss her Duty murmured I was awake all night too dreading
it You didnt know but I was there

The last day when it came seemed a littlea good deallike that
other day when Aunt Olivia went away only it was the other way about
this time Rebecca Mary was going away on this day The things packed
snugly in the big valise were her things it was she Rebecca Mary who
would unpack them in a wondrous strange place It was Rebecca Mary the
ministers wife and Rhoda came to bid goodbye

Aunt Olivia went to the station in the stage with the child She did not
speak much on the way but sat firmly straight and smiled Duty had told
her the last thing to smile But Duty had not trusted her unseen and
uninvited Duty had slipped into the jolting old vehicle between Aunt
Olivia and Rebecca Mary

She isnt the Plummer she was once sighed Duty

But at the little station in those few final moments two Plummers an
old one and a young one waited quietly together Neither of them broke
down nor made ado Duty retired in palpable chagrin

Goodbye my dear Aunt Olivia said steadily though her lips were
white

Goodbye Aunt Olivia Rebecca Mary Plummer said steadily Im very
MUCH obliged to you for sending me

Yourewelcome Dont forget to wear your rubbers I put in some
liniment in case you need itdont get any in your eyes

Outside on the platform Aunt Olivia sought and found Rebecca Marys
window and stood beside it till the train started Through the dusty
pane their faces looked oddly unfamiliar to each other and the two
pairs of eyes that gazed out and in had a startled wistfulness in them
that no Plummer eyes should have If Duty had staid

The train shook itself gave a jerk or two and plunged down the shining
rails Aunt Olivia watched it out of sight then turned patiently to
meet her loneliness The Dreads came flocking back to her as if she had
beckoned to them For now was the time

The letters Rebecca Mary wrote were formally correct and brief There
was no homesickness in them It was pleasant at the school that book
about bones was going to be very interesting Aunt Olivia was not to
worry about the rubbers and Rebecca Mary would never forget to air her
clothes when they came from the wash Yes she had aired the nightgown
that Aunt Olivia ironed the last thing No she hadnt needed any
liniment yet but she wouldnt get any in her eyes

Aunt Olivias letters were to the point and calm as though Duty stood
peering over her shoulder as she wrote She was glad Rebecca Mary
liked the bones but she was a little surprised She was glad about the
rubbers and the wash she was glad there had been no need yet for the
liniment It was a good thing to rub on a sore throat The ministers
wife had been over with her work she said Rhoda missed Rebecca Mary
Yes the little white cat was wellno she hadnt caught any mice
The calla lily had two buds the Northern Spy tree was not going to bear
very well

Robert Ive been to see Miss Olivia the ministers wife said at tea

Yes The minister waited He knew it was coming

She was knitting stockings for Rebecca Mary Robert she sat there and
smiled till I had to come home to cry

My deardo you want me to cry too

Im agoing to sniffed Rhoda I feel it coming

She is so lonely Robert It would break your heart to see her smile
How do I know she is Oh nono she didnt say she was But I saw her
eyes and she let the little white cat get up in her lap

Proof enough the minister said gently

Between the two of themthe child at school and Aunt Olivia at
homeletters came and went for six weeks Aunt Olivia wrote six
Rebecca Mary six All the letters were terse and brief and unemotional
Weather bones little white cats linimenteverything in them but
loneliness or love Rebecca Mary began all hers Dear Aunt Olivia and
ended them all Respectfully your niece Rebecca Mary Plummer

Dear Rebecca Mary began Aunt Olivias Your aff aunt Olivia
Plummer they closed Yet both their hearts were breaking Some hearts
break quicker than others Plummer hearts hold out splendidly but in
the end

In the end Aunt Olivia went to see the minister and was closeted with
him for a little The ministers wife could hear them talkingmostly
the ministerbut she could not hear what they said

Its come she nodded sagely I was sure it would Thats what the
little white cat purred when she rubbed against my skirts She cant
stand it much longer She doesnt sleep nights nor eat daysshes
giving out Poor Miss Oliviabut I cant understand Rebecca Mary

Its the Plummer in her the little white cat would have purred You
wait

Aunt Olivia turned back at the ministers study door Then you will
she said eagerly Youre perfectly willing to I dont want to feel

You neednt feel the minister smiled Im more than willing Im
delighted But in the matter oferremuneration I cannot let you

You neednt let me smiled Miss Olivia Ill do it without She was
gently radiant Her pitifully thin face so transfigured touched the
big heart of the minister He went to his window and watched the slight
figure hurry away He would scarcely have been surprised to see it turn
down the road that led towards the railway station

Oh Robert It was the ministers wife at his elbow You dear boy I
know youve promised You neednt tell me a thingdidnt I suggest it
in the first place Dear Miss OliviaIm so glad Robert So are you
glad you minister But they were neither of them thinking of little
stubbedout shoes that would be easier to buy

Aunt Olivia turned down the station road the next morning in the
swaying old stage Her eager gaze never left the plodding horses as if
by looking at them she could make them go faster

Theyre pretty slow arent they she said

SlowTHEM Well I guess you werent never a stage horse chuckled
the old man at the reins

No admitted Aunt Olivia I never was but I know Id go faster
today

At the Junction halfway to Rebecca Mary she descended alertly from the
train and crossed the platform She must wait here they told her an
hour and twenty minutes On the other side of the station a train was
just slowing up and she stood a moment to scan idly the thin stream
of people that trickled from the cars There were old womendid any of
them she wondered feel as happy as she did There were tall children
too There was oneAunt Olivia started a little and fumbled in her soft
hair under the roses in her bonnet brim for her glasses There was
one tall childshe was coming this wayshe was coming fastshe was
running Her arms were out

Aunt Olivia Aunt Olivia the Tall Child was crying out joyously
Oh Aunt Olivia

Rebecca Marymy dear my dear

They were in each others arms The roses on Aunt Olivias bonnet brim
slipped to one sidethe two of them not Plummers any more but a
common glad old woman and a common glad tall child were kissing each
other as though they would never stop The stream of people reached them
and flowed by on either side Trains came and went and still they stood
like that

Hoitytoity muttered Aunt Olivias Duty and slipped past with the
stream A Plummer to the end what use to stay any longer there

I was coming home cried Rebecca Mary I couldnt bear it another
minute

I was coming after youmy dear my DEAR _I_ couldnt bear it another
minute
