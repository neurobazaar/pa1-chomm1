Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

ACT 1

Scene I Street in Messina

Enter Leonato Hero Beatrice and others with a Messenger

Leon
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this
night to Messina

Mess
He is very near by this he was not three leagues off when I
left him

Leon
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action

Mess
But few of any sort and none of name

Leon
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young Florentine called Claudio

Mess
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro
He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed
better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell
you how

Leon
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it

Mess
I have already delivered him letters and there appears much
joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness

Leon
Did he break out into tears

Mess
In great measure

Leon
A kind overflow of kindness There are no faces truer than
those that are so washed How much better is it to weep at joy
than to joy at weeping

Beat
I pray you is Signior Montanto returned from the wars or no

Mess
I know none of that name lady there was none such in the
army of any sort

Leon
What is he that you ask for niece

Hero
My cousin means signior Benedick of Padua

Mess
O he is returned and as pleasant as ever he was

Beat
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at
the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge
subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the birdbolt I pray
you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars But how
many hath he killed for indeed I promised to eat all of his
killing

Leon
Faith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much but hell
be meet with you I doubt it not

Mess
He hath done good service lady in these wars

Beat
You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a
very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach

Mess
And a good soldier too lady

Beat
And a good soldier to a ladyBut what is he to a lord

Mess
A lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable
virtues

Beat
It is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for
the stuffingWell we are all mortal

Leon
You must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry
war betwixt signior Benedick and her they never meet but there
is a skirmish of wit between them

Beat
Alas he gets nothing by that In our last conflict four of
his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed
with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
creature Who is his companion now He hath every month a new
sworn brother

Mess
Is it possible

Beat
Very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion
of his hat it ever changes with the next block

Mess
I see lady the gentleman is not in your books

Beat
No an he were I would burn my study But I pray you who is
his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil

Mess
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio

Beat
O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner
caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad
God help the noble Claudio if he have caught the Benedick it
will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured

Mess
I will hold friends with you lady

Beat
Do good friend

Leon
You will neer run mad niece

Beat
No not till a hot January

Mess
Don Pedro is approached

Enter Don Pedro attended by Balthazar and others Don John
Claudio and Benedick

D Pedro
Good signior Leonato you are come to meet your trouble the
fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it

Leon
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace
for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you
depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave

D Pedro
You embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your
daughter

Leon
Her mother hath many times told me so

Bene
Were you in doubt that you asked her

Leon
Signior Benedick no for then were you a child

D Pedro
You have it full Benedick we may guess by this what you
are being a man Truly the lady fathers herselfBe happy
lady for you are like an honourable father

Bene
If Signior Leonato be her father she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she is

Beat
I wonder that you will still be talking signior Benedick
nobody marks you

Bene
What my dear lady Disdain are you yet living

Beat
Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as signior Benedick Courtesy itself must
convert to disdain if you come in her presence

Bene
Then is courtesy a turncoatBut it is certain I am loved of
all ladies only you excepted and I would I could find in my
heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love none

Beat
A dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor I thank God and my cold blood I am
of your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me

Bene
God keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman
or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face

Beat
Scratching could not make it worse an t were such a face as
yours were

Bene
Well you are a rare parrotteacher

Beat
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours

Bene
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a
continuer But keep your way o Gods name I have done

Beat
You always end with a jades trick I know you of old

D Pedro
That is the sum of all LeonatoSignior Claudio and signior
Benedickmy dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell
him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly
prays some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is
no hypocrite but prays from his heart

Leon
If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
Let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled
to the prince your brother I owe you all duty

D John
I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you

Leon
Please it your grace lead on

D Pedro
Your hand Leonato we will go together

Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio

Claud
Benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior Leonato

Bene
I noted her not but I looked on her

Claud
Is she not a modest young lady

Bene
Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple
true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as
being a professed tyrant to their sex

Claud
No I pray thee speak in sober judgment
Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise
too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise
only this commendation I can afford her that were she other
than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she
is I do not like her

Claud
Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how
thou likest her

Bene
Would you buy her that you enquire after her

Claud
Can the world buy such a jewel

Bene
Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad
brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a
good harefinder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come in what key
shall a man take you to go in the song

Claud
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on

Bene
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter
theres her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury
exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the
last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn
husband have you

Claud
I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the
contrary if Hero would be my wife

Bene
Ist come to this i faith Hath not the world one man but
he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a
bachelor of threescore again Go to i faith an thou wilt
needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and
sigh away Sundays Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you

Reenter Don Pedro

D Pedro
What secret hath held you here that you followed not to
Leonatos

Bene
I would your Grace would constrain me to tell

D Pedro
I charge thee on thy allegiance

Bene
You hear count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I
would have you think so but on my allegiancemark you this on
my allegianceHe is in love With whonow that is your
Graces partMark how short his answer isWith Hero
Leonatos short daughter

Claud
If this were so so were it uttered

Bene
Like the old tale my lord it is not so nor t was not so
but indeed God forbid it should be so

Claud
If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be
otherwise

D Pedro
Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy

Claud
You speak this to fetch me in my lord

D Pedro
By my troth I speak my thought

Claud
And in faith my lord I spoke mine

Bene
And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine

Claud
That I love her I feel

D Pedro
That she is worthy I know

Bene
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she
should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me
I will die in it at the stake

D Pedro
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty

Claud
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his
will

Bene
That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up
I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have
a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible
baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them
the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust
none and the fine is for the which I may go the finer I will
live a bachelor

D Pedro
I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love

Bene
With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with
love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get
again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmakers
pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of
blind Cupid

D Pedro
Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt
prove a notable argument

Bene
If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and
he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called
Adam

D Pedro
Well as time shall try
In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke

Bene
The savage bull may but if ever this sensible Benedick bear
it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and
let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write
Here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign
Here you may see Benedick the married man

Claud
If this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad

D Pedro
Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou
wilt quake for this shortly

Bene
I look for an earthquake too then

D Pedro
Well you will temporize with the hours In the meantime
good signior Benedick repair to Leonatos commend me to him
and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he
hath made great preparation

Bene
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and
so I commit you

Claud
To the tuition of God From my house if I had it

D Pedro
The sixth of July Your loving friend Benedick

Bene
Nay mock not mock not The body of your discourse is
sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly
basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine
your conscience and so I leave you

Exit Benedick

Claud
My liege your highness now may do me good

D Pedro
My love is thine to teach teach it but how
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good

Claud
Hath Leonato any son my lord

D Pedro
No child but Hero shes his only heir
Dost thou affect her Claudio

Claud
O my lord
When you went onward on this ended action
I lookd upon her with a soldiers eye
That likd but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love
But now I am returnd and that warthoughts
Have left their places vacant in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires
All prompting me how fair young Hero is
Saying I likd her ere I went to wars

D Pedro
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words
If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it
And I will break with her and with her father
And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end
That thou begannst to twist so fine a story

Claud
How sweetly do you minister to love
That know loves grief by his complexion
But lest my liking might too sudden seem
I would have salvd it with a longer treatise

D Pedro
What need the bridge much broader than the flood
The fairest grant is the necessity
Look what will serve is fit t is once thou lovest
And I will fit thee with the remedy
I know we shall have revelling tonight
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio
And in her bosom Ill unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale
Then after to her father will I break
And the conclusion is she shall be thine
In practice let us put it presently

Exeunt



Scene IIA Room in Leonatos House

Enter Leonato and Antonio

Leon
How now brother Where is my cousin your son Hath he
provided this music

Ant
He is very busy about it But brother I can tell you
news that you yet dream not of

Leon
Are they good

Ant
As the event stamps them but they have a good cover they
show well outward The prince and count Claudio walking in a
thickpleached alley in mine orchard were thus overheard by
a man of mine The prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a
dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the
present time by the top and instantly break with you of it

Leon
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this

Ant
A good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him
yourself

Leon
No no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itselfbut
I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better
prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true Go you and
tell her of it

Several persons cross the stage

Cousins you know what you have to doO I cry you mercy
friend go you with me and I will use your skill
Good cousins have a care this busy time

Exeunt



Scene IIIAnother room in Leonatos house

Enter Don John and Conrade

Con
What the good year my lord why are you thus out of measure
sad

D John
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore
the sadness is without limit

Con
You should hear reason

D John
And when I have heard it what blessing bringeth it

Con
If not a present remedy yet a patient sufferance

D John
I wonder that thou being as thou sayst thou art born
under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when
I have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when I have
stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when I am drowsy
and tend on no mans business laugh when I am merry and claw no
man in his humour

Con
Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment You have of late stood out against
your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where
it is impossible you should take root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest

D John
had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace
and it better fits my blood to be disdaind of all than to
fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though I cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but
I am a plaindealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and
enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in
my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I
would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me

Con
Can you make no use of your discontent

D John
I make all use of it for I use it only Who comes here
What news Borachio

Enter Borachio

Bora
I came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is
royally entertained by Leonato and I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage

D John
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness

Bora
Marry it is your brothers right hand

D John
Who the most exquisite Claudio

Bora
Even he

D John
A proper squire And who and who which way looks he

Bora
Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato

D John
A very forward Marchchick How came you to this

Bora
Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty
room comes me the prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad
conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it
agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself
and having obtained her give her to Count Claudio

D John
Come come let us thither this may prove food to my
displeasure that young startup hath all the glory of my
overthrow if I can cross him any way I bless myself every way
You are both sure and will assist me

Con
To the death my lord

D John
Let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that
I am subdued Would the cook were of my mind Shall we go prove
whats to be done

Bora
Well wait upon your lordship

Exeunt




ACT 2

Scene IA hall in Leonatos house

Enter Leonato Antonio Hero Beatrice and others

Leon
Was not Count John here at supper

Ant
I saw him not

Beat
How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am
heartburned an hour after

Hero
He is of a very melancholy disposition

Beat
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says
nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore
tattling

Leon
Then half signior Benedicks tongue in count Johns mouth
and half count Johns melancholy in signior Benedicks face

Beat
With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in
his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if he
could get her good will

Leon
By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd of thy tongue

Ant
In faith she is too curst

Beat
Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen Gods sending
that way for it is said God sends a curst cow short horns
but to a cow too curst he sends none

Leon
So by being too curst God will send you no horns

Beat
Just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am
at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not
endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie
inwoollen

Leon
You may light upon a husband that hath no beard

Beat
What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make
him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a
youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that
is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
man I am not for him Therefore I will even take sixpence in
earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell

Leon
Well then go you into hell

Beat
No but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an
old cuckold with horns on his head and say Get you to heaven
Beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids So
deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the heavens
he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry
as the day is long

Ant
Well niece to Hero I trust you will be ruled by your
father

Beat
Yes faith it is my cousins duty to make courtesy and say
Father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him
be a handsome fellow or else make another courtesy and say
Father as it please me

Leon
Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband

Beat
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would
it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant
dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
No uncle Ill none Adams sons are my brethren and truly I
hold it a sin to match in my kindred

Leon
Daughter remember what I told you if the prince do solicit
you in that kind you know your answer

Beat
The fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed
in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is
measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear
me Hero Wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a
measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like
a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding
mannerlymodest as a measure full of state and ancientry and
then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the
cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave

Leon
Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly

Beat
have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight

Leon
The revellers are entering brother Make good room

Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick Balthazar
Don John Borachio Margaret Ursula and others masked

D Pedro
Lady will you walk about with your friend

Hero
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing
I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away

D Pedro
With me in your company

Hero
I may say so when I please

D Pedro
And when please you to say so

Hero
When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be
like the case

D Pedro
My visor is Philemons roof within the house is Jove

Hero
Why then your visor should be thatchd

D Pedro
Speak low if you speak love

Takes her aside

Balth
Well I would you did like me

Marg
So would not I for your own sake for I have many ill qualities

Balth
Which is one

Marg
I say my prayers aloud

Balth
I love you the better the hearers may cry Amen

Marg
God match me with a good dancer

Balth
Amen

Marg
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done
Answer clerk

Balth
No more words the clerk is answered

Urs
I know you well enough You are signior Antonio

Ant
At a word I am not

Urs
I know you by the waggling of your head

Ant
To tell you true I counterfeit him

Urs
You could never do him so illwell unless you were the very
man Heres his dry hand up and down you are he you are he

Ant
At a word I am not

Urs
Come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent
wit Can virtue hide itself Go to mum you are he graces
will appear and theres an end

Beat
Will you not tell me who told you so

Bene
No you shall pardon me

Beat
Nor will you not tell me who you are

Bene
Not now

Beat
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the
Hundred merry TalesWell this was signior Benedick that said
so

Bene
Whats he

Beat
I am sure you know him well enough

Bene
Not I believe me

Beat
Did he never make you laugh

Bene
I pray you what is he

Beat
Why he is the Princes jester a very dull fool only his
gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines
delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in
his villany for he both pleaseth men and angers them and then
they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet
I would he had boarded me

Bene
When I know the gentleman Ill tell him what you say

Beat
Do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which
peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into
melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the
fool will eat no supper that night Music within We must
follow the leaders

Bene
In every good thing

Beat
Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next
turning

Dance Then exeunt all but Don John Borachio and Claudio

D John
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her
father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but
one visor remains

Bora
And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing

D John
Are you not signior Benedick

Claud
You know me well I am he

D John
Signior you are very near my brother in his love he is
enamourd on Hero I pray you dissuade him from her she is no
equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it

Claud
How know you he loves her

D John
I heard him swear his affection

Bora
So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight

D John
Come let us to the banquet

Exeunt Don John and Borachio

Claud
Thus answer I in name of Benedick
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
T is certain sothe prince woos for himself
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
Let every eye negociate for itself
And trust no agent for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood
This is an accident of hourly proof
Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero

Reenter Benedick

Bene
Count Claudio

Claud
Yea the same

Bene
Come will you go with me

Claud
Whither

Bene
Even to the next willow about your own business count What
fashion will you wear the garland of About your neck like an
usurers chain or under your arm like a lieutenants scarf
You must wear it one way for the Prince hath got your Hero

Claud
I wish him joy of her

Bene
Why thats spoken like an honest drover so they sell
bullocks But did you think the Prince would have served you
thus

Claud
I pray you leave me

Bene
Ho now you strike like the blind man t was the boy that
stole your meat and youll beat the post

Claud
If it will not be Ill leave you

Exit

Bene
Alas poor hurt fowl Now will he creep into sedges But
that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me The
princes foolHa it may be I go under that title because I am
merryYea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so
reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well
Ill be revenged as I may

Reenter Don Pedro

D Pedro
Now signior wheres the count Did you see him

Bene
Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found
him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I
think I told him true that your grace had got the will of
this young lady and I offered him my company to a willowtree
either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him
a rod as being worthy to be whipped

D Pedro
To be whipped Whats his fault

Bene
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyd with
finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it

D Pedro
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is
in the stealer

Bene
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the
garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the
rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stolen
his birds nest

D Pedro
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner

Bene
If their singing answer your saying by my faith you say
honestly

D Pedro
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that
danced with her told her she is much wrongd by you

Bene
O she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but
with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor
began to assume life and scold with her She told me not
thinking I had been myself that I was the princes jester and
that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with
such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark
with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every
word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
there were no living near her she would infect to the North
Star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all
that Adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made
Hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make
the fire too Come talk not of her you shall find her the
infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would
conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as
quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose
because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
and perturbation follows her

Reenter Claudio Beatrice Leonato and Hero

D Pedro
Look here she comes

Bene
Will your grace command me any service to the worlds end I
will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you
can devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from
the farthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester Johns
foot fetch you a hair off the great Chams beard do you any
embassage to the Pygmiesrather than hold three words
conference with this harpy You have no employment for me

D Pedro
None but to desire your good company

Bene
O God sir heres a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady
Tongue

Exit

D Pedro
Come lady come you have lost the heart of signior Benedick

Beat
Indeed my lord he lent it me a while and I gave him use for
ita double heart for a single one marry once before he won
it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say I
have lost it

D Pedro
You have put him down lady you have put him down

Beat
So I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove
the mother of fools I have brought count Claudio whom you sent
me to seek

D Pedro
Why how now count wherefore are you sad

Claud
Not sad my lord

D Pedro
How then sick

Claud
Neither my lord

Beat
The count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but
civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous
complexion

D Pedro
I faith lady I think your blazon to be true though Ill
be sworn if he be so his conceit is false Here Claudio I
have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with
her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage
and God give thee joy

Leon
Count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his
grace hath made the match and all grace say Amen to it

Beat
Speak Count tis your cue

Claud
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little
happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am
yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange

Beat
Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss
and let not him speak neither

D Pedro
In faith lady you have a merry heart

Beat
Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy
side of careMy cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her
heart

Claud
And so she doth cousin

Beat
Good Lord for allianceThus goes every one to the world but
I and I am sunburned I may sit in a corner and cry heighho
for a husband

D Pedro
Lady Beatrice I will get you one

Beat
I would rather have one of your fathers getting Hath your
grace neer a brother like you Your father got excellent
husbands if a maid could come by them

D Pedro
Will you have me lady

Beat
No my lord unless I might have another for workingdays
your grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your
grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter

D Pedro
Your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes
you for out of question you were born in a merry hour

Beat
No sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star
danced and under that was I bornCousins God give you joy

Leon
Niece will you look to those things I told you of

Beat
I cry you mercy uncleBy your graces pardon

Exit Beatrice

D Pedro
By my troth a pleasantspirited lady

Leon
Theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she
is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I
have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness
and waked herself with laughing

D Pedro
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband

Leon
O by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit

D Pedro
She were an excellent wife for Benedick

Leon
O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would
talk themselves mad

D Pedro
Count Claudio when mean you to go to church

Claud
Tomorrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all
his rites

Leon
Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight
and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind

D Pedro
Come you shake the head at so long a breathingI warrant thee
Claudio the time shall not go dully by us
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labours which
is to bring signior Benedick and the lady Beatrice into a
mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have
it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will
but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction

Leon
My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights
watchings

Claud
And I my lord

D Pedro
And you too gentle Hero

Hero
I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a
good husband

D Pedro
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know
thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved
valour and confirmd honesty I will teach you how to humour
your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedickand I
with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall
in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer
an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods
Go in with me and I will tell you my drift

Exeunt




Scene IIAnother Room in Leonatos House

Enter Don John and Borachio

D John
It is so the count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato

Bora
Yea my lord but I can cross it

D John
Any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me
I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his
affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this
marriage

Bora
Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me

D John
Show me briefly how

Bora
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in
the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero

D John
I remember

Bora
I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her
to look out at her ladys chamberwindow

D John
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage

Bora
The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the
prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio whose estimation do
you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as
Hero

D John
What proof shall I make of that

Bora
Proof enough to misuse the prince to vex Claudio to undo
Hero and kill Leonato look you for any other issue

D John
Only to despite them I will endeavour anything

Bora
Go then find me a meet hour to draw don Pedro and the count
Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me
intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio asin a
love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his
friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus They will
scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which
shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow
hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and
bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding
for in the mean time I will so fashion the matter that Hero
shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of
Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all
the preparation overthrown

D John
Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in
practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a
thousand ducats

Bora
Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not
shame me

D John
I will presently go learn their day of marriage

Exeunt



Scene IIILeonatos Garden

Enter Benedick and a Boy

Bene
Boy

Boy
Signior

Bene
In my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither to me in
the orchard

Boy
I am here already sir

Bene
I know thatbut I would have thee hence and here again
Exit BoyI do much wonder that one man seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love
will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love And
such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with
him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor
and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile
afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain
and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is
he turned orthographer his words are a very fantastical banquet
just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with
these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but
love may transform me to an oyster but Ill take my oath on it
till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a
fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am
well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in
one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall
be thats certain wise or Ill none virtuous or Ill never
cheapen her fair or Ill never look on her mild or come not
near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an
excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it
please God Ha the prince and monsieur Love I will hide me in
the arbour

Withdraws

Enter Don Pedro Leonato and Claudio

D Pedro
Come shall we hear this music

Claud
Yea my good lordHow still the evening is
As hushd on purpose to grace harmony

D Pedro
See you where Benedick hath hid himself

Claud
O very well my lord the music ended
Well fit the kid fox with a pennyworth

Enter Balthazar with music

D Pedro
Come Balthazar well hear that song again

Balth
O good my lord tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once

D Pedro
It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more

Balth
Because you talk of wooing I will sing
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy yet he woos
Yet will he swear he loves

D Pedro
Nay pray thee come
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument
Do it in notes

Balth
Note this before my notes
Theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting

D Pedro
Why these are very crotchets that he speaks
Note notes forsooth and noting

Music

Bene
Now Divine air now is his soul ravishedIs it not
strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies
Well a horn for my money when alls done

Balthazar sings

 I

 Sigh no more ladies sigh no more
 Men were deceivers ever
 One foot in sea and one on shore
 To one thing constant never
 Then sigh not so
 But let them go
 And be you blithe and bonny
 Converting all your sounds of woe
 Into Hey nonny nonny


 II

 Sing no more ditties sing no mo
 Of dumps so dull and heavy
 The fraud of men was ever so
 Since summer first was leavy
 Then sigh not so c



D Pedro
By my troth a good song

Balth
And an ill singer my lord

D Pedro
Ha no no faith thou singst well enough for a shift

Bene
Aside An he had been a dog that should have howled thus
they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad voice bode no
mischief I had as lief have heard the nightraven come what
plague could have come after it

D Pedro
Yea marry to ClaudioDost thou hear Balthazar I pray
thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would
have it at the lady Heros chamberwindow

Balth
The best I can my lord

D Pedro
Do so farewell Exeunt Balthazar Come hither Leonato What
was it you told me of today that your niece Beatrice was in
love with signior Benedick

Claud
O ayStalk on stalk on the fowl sits Aside to Pedro I did
never think that lady would have loved any man

Leon
No nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote
on signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours
seemed ever to abhor

Bene
Ist possible Sits the wind in that corner Aside

Leon
By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but
that she loves him with an enraged affectionit is past the
infinite of thought

D Pedro
May be she doth but counterfeit

Claud
Faith like enough

Leon
O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion as she discovers it

D Pedro
Why what effects of passion shows she

Claud
Bait the hook well this fish will bite Aside

Leon
What effects my lord She will sit youYou heard my
daughter tell you how

Claud
She did indeed

D Pedro
How how I pray you You amaze me I would have thought her
spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection

Leon
I would have sworn it had my lord especially against
Benedick

Bene
Aside I should think this a gull but that the whitebearded
fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such
reverence

Claud
He hath taen the infection Hold it up Aside

D Pedro
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick

Leon
No and swears she never will thats her torment

Claud
T is true indeed so your daughter says Shall I says
she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him
that I love him

Leon
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him for
shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her
smock till she have writ a sheet of papermy daughter tells us
all

Claud
Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of

Leon
OWhen she had writ it and was reading it over she found
Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet

Claud
That

Leon
O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at
herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
knew would flout her I measure him says she by my own
spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me yea though I
love him I should

Claud
Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her
heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God
give me patience

Leon
She doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so
much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true

D Pedro
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she
will not discover it

Claud
To what end He would make but a sport of it and torment the
poor lady worse

D Pedro
An he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an
excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous

Claud
And she is exceeding wise

D Pedro
In everything but in loving Benedick

Leon
O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am
sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her
guardian

D Pedro
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have
daffd all other respects and made her half myself I pray you
tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say

Leon
Were it good think you

Claud
Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die
if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known
and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one
breath of her accustomed crossness

D Pedro
She doth well if she should make tender of her love t is
very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath
a contemptible spirit

Claud
He is a very proper man

D Pedro
He hath indeed a good outward happiness

Claud
Fore God and in my mind very wise

D Pedro
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit

Leon
And I take him to be valiant

D Pedro
As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you
may see he is wise for either he avoids them with great
discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear

Leon
If he do fear God he must necessarily keep peace if he
break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
trembling

D Pedro
And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it
seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am
sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
her love

Claud
Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel

Leon
Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first

D Pedro
Well we will hear further of it by your daughter Let it
cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would
modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy to have
so good a lady

Leon
My lord will you walk dinner is ready

Claud
If he dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation
Aside

D Pedro
Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your
daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they
hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter
thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb
show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Aside

Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato

Benedick advances from the arbour

Bene
This can be no trick The conference was sadly borneThey
have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady
it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it
must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear
myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say
too that she will rather die than give any sign of affectionI
did never think to marryI must not seem proudHappy are they
that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They
say the lady is fair t is a truth I can bear them witness and
virtuoust is so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving
meBy my troth it is no addition to her witnor no great
argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her
I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on
me because I have railed so long against marriage But doth not
the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he
cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these
paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his
humour No The world must be peopled When I said I would die
a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married
Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy
some marks of love in her

Enter Beatrice

Beat
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner

Bene
Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains

Beat
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
thank me if it had been painful I would not have come

Bene
You take pleasure then in the message

Beat
Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and
choke a daw withalYou have no stomach signior fare you well

Exit

Bene
Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner
theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for
those thanks than you took pains to thank methats as much
as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks
If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love
her I am a Jew I will go get her picture

Exit



ACT III

Scene ILeonardos Garden

Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula

Hero
Good Margaret run thee to the parlour
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her say that thou overheardst us
And bid her steal into the pleached bower
Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun
Forbid the sun to enterlike favourites
Made proud by princes that advance their pride
Against that power that bred itthere will she hide her
To listen our propose This is thy office
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone

Marg
Ill make her come I warrant you presently

Exit

Hero
Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come
As we do trace this alley up and down
Our talk must only be of Benedick
When I do name him let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter
Is little Cupids crafty arrow made
That only wounds by hearsay Now begin

Enter Beatrice behind

For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Close by the ground to hear our conference

Urs
The pleasantest angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait
So angle we for Beatrice who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture
Fear you not my part of the dialogue

Hero
Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it

They advance to the bower

No truly Ursula she is too disdainful
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggards of the rock

Urs
But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely

Hero
So says the prince and my newtrothed lord

Urs
And did they bid you tell her of it madam

Hero
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it
But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick
To wish him wrestle with affection
And never to let Beatrice know of it

Urs
Why did you so Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon

Hero
O God of love I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man
But Nature never framd a womans heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
Misprizing what they look on and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak she cannot love
Nor take no shape nor project of affection
She is so selfendeared

Urs
Sure I think so
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love lest shell make sport at it

Hero
Why you speak truth I never yet saw man
How wise how noble young how rarely featurd
But she would spell him backward if fairfacd
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister
If black why Nature drawing of an antic
Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
If low an agate very vilely cut
If speaking why a vane blown with all winds
If silent why a block moved with none
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth

Urs
Sure sure such carping is not commendable

Hero
No not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is cannot be commendable
But who dare tell her so If I should speak
She would mock me into air O she would laugh me
Out of myself press me to death with wit
Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire
Consume away in sighs waste inwardly
It were a better death than die with mocks
Which is as bad as die with tickling

Urs
Yet tell her of it hear what she will say

Hero
No rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion
And truly Ill devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with One doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking

Urs
O do not do your cousin such a wrong
She cannot be so much without true judgment
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prizd to have as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as signior Benedick

Hero
He is the only man of Italy
Always excepted my dear Claudio

Urs
I pray you be not angry with me madam
Speaking my fancy signior Benedick
For shape for bearing argument and valour
Goes foremost in report through Italy

Hero
Indeed he hath an excellent good name

Urs
His excellence did earn it ere he had it
When are you married madam

Hero
Why every daytomorrow Come go in
Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me to morrow

Urs
Shes taen I warrant you we have caught her madam

Hero
If it prove so then loving goes by haps
Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps

Exeunt Hero and Ursula

Beatrice advances

Beat
What fire is in mine ears Can this be true
Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much
Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
No glory lives behind the back of such
And Benedick love on I will requite thee
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band
For others say thou dost deserve and I
Believe it better than reportingly

Exit



Scene IIA Room in Leonatos House

Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato

D Pedro
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go
I toward Arragon

Claud
Ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me

D Pedro
Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear
it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth
he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bowstring and the little
hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a
bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks
his tongue speaks

Bene
Gallants I am not as I have been

Leon
So say I methinks you are sadder

Claud
I hope he be in love

D Pedro
Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be
truly touchd with love if he be sad he wants money

Bene
I have the toothach

D Pedro
Draw it

Bene
Hang it

Claud
You must hang it first and draw it afterwards

D Pedro
What sigh for the toothach

Leon
Where is but a humour or a worm

Bene
Well every one can master a grief but he that has it

Claud
Yet say I he is in love

D Pedro
There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy
that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a
Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once
as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard
from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this
foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you
would have it appear he is

Claud
If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing
old signs he brushes his hat o mornings What should that bode

D Pedro
Hath any man seen him at the barbers

Claud
No but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the
old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffd tennisballs

Leon
Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard

D Pedro
Nay he rubs himself with civet Can you smell him out by
that

Claud
Thats as much as to say The sweet youths in love

D Pedro
The greatest note of it is his melancholy

Claud
And when was he wont to wash his face

D Pedro
Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say
of him

Claud
Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a
lutestring and now governed by stops

D Pedro
Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude he is in love

Claud
Nay but I know who loves him

D Pedro
That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not

Claud
Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for
him

D Pedro
She shall be buried with her face upwards

Bene
Yet is this no charm for the toothachOld signior walk
aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak
to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear

Exeunt Benedick and Leonato

D Pedro
For my life to break with him about Beatrice

Claud
T is even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their
parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one
another when they meet

Enter Don John

D John
My lord and brother God save you

D Pedro
Good den brother

D John
If your leisure served I would speak with you

D Pedro
In private

D John
If it please youyet count Claudio may hear for what I
would speak of concerns him

D Pedro
Whats the matter

D John
Means your lordship to be married tomorrow to Claudio

D Pedro
You know he does

D John
I know not that when he knows what I know

Claud
If there be any impediment I pray you discover it

D John
You may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and
aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I
think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to
effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labour
ill bestowed

D Pedro
Why whats the matter

D John
I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for
she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal

Claud
Who Hero

D John
Even she Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Hero

Claud
Disloyal

D John
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness I could say
she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her
to Wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight
you shall see her chamberwindow entered even the night before
her wedding day if you love her then tomorrow wed her but
it would better fit your honour to change your mind

Claud
May this be so

D Pedro
I will not think it

D John
If you dare not trust that you see confess not that you
know if you will follow me I will show you enough and when you
have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly

Claud
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her
tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I
shame her

D Pedro
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with
thee to disgrace her

D John
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses
bear it coldly but till night and let the issue show itself

D Pedro
O day untowardly turned

Claud
O mischief strangely thwarting

D John
O plague right well prevented
So will you say when you have seen the sequel

Exeunt




Scene IIIA Street

Enter Dogberry and Verges with the Watch

Dogb
Are you good men and true

Verg
Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation
body and soul

Dogb
Nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should
have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watch

Verg
Well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry

Dogb
First who think you the most desartless man to be constable

1 Watch
Hugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write
and read

Dogb
Come hither neighbour Seacoal God hath blessed you with a
good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but
to write and read comes by nature

2 Watch
Both which Master Constable

Dogb
You have I knew it would be your answer Well for your
favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and
for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no
need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore
bear you the lantern This is your charge You shall comprehend
all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes
name

2 Watch
How if a will not stand

Dogb
Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently
call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of
a knave

Verg
If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the
princes subjects

Dogb
True and they are to meddle with none but the Princes
subjectsYou shall also make no noise in the streets for for
the watch to babble and talk is most tolerable and not to be
endured

2 Watch
We will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to
a watch

Dogb
Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that
your bills be not stolenWell you are to call at all the
alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed

2 Watch
How if they will not

Dogb
Why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you
not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you
took them for

2 Watch
Well sir

Dogb
If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your
office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less
you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty

2 Watch
If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on
him

Dogb
Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch
pitch will be defiled The most peaceable way for you if you do
take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal
out of your company

Verg
You have been always called a merciful man partner

Dogb
Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who
hath any honesty in him

Verg
If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the
nurse and bid her still it

2 Watch
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us

Dogb
Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with
crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will
never answer a calf when he bleats

Verg
T is very true

Dogb
This is the end of the charge You constable are to present
the princes own person if you meet the prince in the night
you may stay him

Verg
Nay byr lady that I think a cannot

Dogb
Five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the
statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be
willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it
is an offence to stay a man against his will

Verg
Byr lady I think it be so

Dogb
Ha ha ha Well masters good night an there be any matter
of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and
your own and good nightCome neighbour

2 Watch
Well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here
upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed

Dogb
One word more honest neighbours I pray you watch about
signior Leonatos door for the wedding being there tomorrow
there is a great coil tonight Adieu be vigitant I beseech
you

Exeunt Dogberry and Verges

Enter Borachio and Conrade

Bora
What Conrade

Watch
Peace stir not Aside

Bora
Conrade I say

Con
Here man I am at thy elbow

Bora
Mass and my elbow itched I thought there would a scab follow

Con
I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy
tale

Bora
Stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles
rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to thee

Watch
aside Some treason masters yet stand close

Bora
Therefore know I have earned of don John a thousand ducats

Con
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear

Bora
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany
should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones
poor ones may make what price they will

Con
I wonder at it

Bora
That shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that the
fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man

Con
Yes it is apparel

Bora
I mean the fashion

Con
Yes the fashion is the fashion

Bora
Tush I may as well say the fools the fool But seest thou
not what a deformed thief this fashion is

Watch
I know that Deformed a has been a vile thief
this seven year a goes up and down like a gentleman I remember
his name

Bora
Didst thou not hear somebody

Con
No t was the vane on the house

Bora
Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is
how giddily he turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen
and fiveandthirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs
soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bels priests
in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in
the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as
massy as his club

Con
All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more
apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the
fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling
me of the fashion

Bora
Not so neither but know that I have tonight wooed Margaret
the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me
out at her mistress chamberwindow bids me a thousand times
good nightI tell this tale vilelyI should first tell thee
how
the prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and
possessed by my master don John saw afar off in the orchard this
amiable encounter

Con
And thought they Margaret was Hero

Bora
Two of them did the prince and Claudio but the devil my
master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which
first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive
them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander
that don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would
meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and
there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw
oernight and send her home again without a husband

1 Watch
We charge you in the princes name stand

2 Watch
Call up the right master constable we have here recovered the
most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the
commonwealth

1 Watch
And one Deformed is one of them I know him a wears a
lock

Con
Masters masters

2 Watch
Youll be made bring Deformed forth I warrant you

Con
Masters

1 Watch
Never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with
us

Bora
We are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of
these mens bills

Con
A commodity in question I warrant you Come well obey you

ACT IV

Scene IThe inside of a Church

Enter Don Pedro Don John Leonato Friar Claudio Benedick
Hero and Beatrice c

Leon
Come Friar Francis be brief only to the plain form of
marriage and you shall recount their particular duties
afterwards

Friar
You come hither my lord to marry this lady

Claud
No

Leon
To be married to her friar you come to marry her

Friar
Lady you come hither to be married to this count

Hero
I do

Friar
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should
not be conjoined I charge you on your souls to utter it

Claud
Know you any Hero

Hero
None my lord

Friar
Know you any count

Leon
I dare make his answer none

Claud
O what men dare do what men may do what men daily do
not knowing what they do

Bene
How now Interjections Why then some be of laughing as
ha ha he

Claud
Stand thee by friarFather by your leave
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid your daughter

Leon
As freely son as God did give her me

Claud
And what have I to give you back whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift

D Pedro
Nothing unless you render her again

Claud
Sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
There Leonato take her back again
Give not this rotten orange to your friend
Shes but the sign and semblance of her honour
Behold how like a maid she blushes here
O what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue Would you not swear
All you that see her that she were a maid
By these exterior shows But she is none
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed
Her blush is guiltiness not modesty

Leon
What do you mean my lord

Claud
Not to be married
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton

Leon
Dear my lord if you in your own proof
Have vanquishd the resistance of her youth
And made defeat of her virginity

Claud
I know what you would say If I have known her
Youll say she did embrace me as a husband
And so extenuate the forehand sin
No Leonato
I never tempted her with word too large
But as a brother to his sister showd
Bashful sincerity and comely love

Hero
And seemd I ever otherwise to you

Claud
Out on the seeming I will write against it
You seem to me as Dian in her orb
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
But you are more intemperate in your blood
Than Venus or those pamperd animals
That rage in savage sensuality

Hero
Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide

Leon
Sweet prince why speak not you

D Pedro
What should I speak
I stand dishonourd that have gone about
To link my dear friend to a common stale

Leon
Are these things spoken or do I but dream

D John
Sir they are spoken and these things are true

Bene
This looks not like a nuptial

Hero
True O God

Claud
Leonato stand I here
Is this the Prince Is this the Princes brother
Is this face Heros Are our eyes our own

Leon
All this is so But what of this my lord

Claud
Let me but move one question to your daughter
And by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her bid her answer truly

Leon
I charge thee do so as thou art my child

Hero
O God defend me how am I beset
What kind of catechising call you this

Claud
To make you answer truly to your name

Hero
Is it not Hero Who can blot that name
With any just reproach

Claud
Marry that can Hero
Hero itself can blot out Heros virtue
What man was he talkd with you yesternight
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one
Now if you are a maid answer to this

Hero
I talkd with no man at that hour my lord

D Pedro
Why then are you no maidenLeonato
I am sorry you must hear Upon my honour
Myself my brother and this grieved count
Did see her hear her at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamberwindow
Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
Confessd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret

D John
Fie fie they are
Not to be namd my lord not to be spoke of
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them Thus pretty lady
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment

Claud
O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been
If half thy outward graces had been placed
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
But fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
Thou pure impiety and impious purity
For thee Ill lock up all the gates of love
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
And never shall it more be gracious

Leon
Hath no mans dagger here a point for me

Hero swoons

Beat
Why how now cousin wherefore sink you down

D John
Come let us go these things come thus to light
Smother her spirits up

Exeunt Don Pedro Don Juan and Claudio

Bene
How doth the lady

Beat
Dead I thinkhelp uncle
Hero why HeroUncleSignior Benedickfriar

Leon
O Fate take not away thy heavy hand
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
That may be wishd for

Beat
How now cousin Hero

Friar
Have comfort lady

Leon
Dost thou look up

Friar
Yea Wherefore should she not

Leon
Wherefore Why doth not every earthly thing
Cry shame upon her Could she here deny
The story that is printed in her blood
Do not live Hero do not ope thine eyes
For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
Myself would on the rearward of reproaches
Strike at thy life Grievd I I had but one
Child I for that at frugal natures frame
O one too much by thee Why had I one
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggars issue at my gates
Who smirched thus and mired with infamy
I might have said No part of it is mine
This shame derives itself from unknown loins
But mine and mine I lovd and mine I praisd
And mine that I was proud on mine so much
That I myself was to myself not mine
Valuing of her why sheO she is fallen
Into a pit of ink that the wide sea
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
And salt too little which may season give
To her foul tainted flesh

Bene
Sir sir be patient
For my part I am so attird in wonder
I know not what to say

Beat
O on my soul my cousin is belied

Bene
Lady were you her bedfellow last night

Beat
No truly not although until last night
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow

Leon
Confirmd confirmd O that is stronger made
Which was before barrd up with ribs of iron
Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie
Who lovd her so that speaking of her foulness
Washd it with tears Hence from her let her die

Friar
Hear me a little
For I have only been silent so long
And given way unto this course of fortune
By noting of the lady I have markd
A thousand blushing apparitions start
Into her face a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes
And in her eye there hath appeard a fire
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truthCall me a fool
Trust not my reading nor my observations
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenour of my book trust not my age
My reverence calling nor divinity
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error

Leon
Friar it cannot be
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury she not denies it
Why seekst thou then to cover with excuse
That which appears in proper nakedness

Friar
Lady what man is he you are accusd of

Hero
They know that do accuse me I know none
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
Let all my sins lack mercyO my father
Prove you that any man with me conversd
At hours unmeet or that I yesternight
Maintaind the change of words with any creature
Refuse me hate me torture me to death

Friar
There is some strange misprision in the princes

Bene
Two of them have the very bent of honour
And if their wisdoms be misled in this
The practice of it lives in John the bastard
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies

Leon
I know not If they speak but truth of her
These hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour
The proudest of them shall well hear of it
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
Nor age so eat up my invention
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
But they shall find awakd in such a kind
Both strength of limb and policy of mind
Ability in means and choice of friends
To quit me of them throughly

Friar
Pause awhile
And let my counsel sway you in this case
Your daughter here the princes left for dead
Let her awhile be secretly kept in
And publish it that she is dead indeed
Maintain a mourning ostentation
And on your familys old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial

Leon
What shall become of this What will this do

Friar
Marry this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse that is some good
But not for that dream I on this strange course
But on this travail look for greater birth
She dying as it must be so maintaind
Upon the instant that she was accusd
Shall be lamented pitied and excusd
Of every hearer For it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost
Why then we rack the value then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio
When he shall hear she died upon his words
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparelld in more precious habit
More movingdelicate and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of his soul
Than when she livd indeedthen shall he mourn
If ever love had interest in his liver
And wish he had not so accused her
No though he thought his accusation true
Let this be so and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood
But if all aim but this be levelld false
The supposition of the ladys death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy
And if it sort not well you may conceal her
As best befits her wounded reputation
In some reclusive and religious life
Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries

Bene
Signior Leonato let the friar advise you
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio
Yet by mine honour I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body

Leon
Being that I flow in grief
The smallest twine may lead me

Friar
T is well consented presently away
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
Come lady die to live this weddingday
Perhaps is but prolongd have patience and endure

Exeunt Friar Hero and Leonato

Bene
Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while

Beat
Yea and I will weep a while longer

Bene
I will not desire that

Beat
You have no reason I do it freely

Bene
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged

Beat
Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her

Bene
Is there any way to show such friendship

Beat
A very even way but no such friend

Bene
May a man do it

Beat
It is a mans office but not yours

Bene
I do love nothing in the world so well as you Is not that
strange

Beat
As strange as the thing I know not It were as possible for
me to say I loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and
yet I lie not I confess nothing nor I deny nothingI am sorry
for my cousin

Bene
By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me

Beat
Do not swear by it and eat it

Bene
I will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat
it that says I love not you

Beat
Will you not eat your word

Bene
With no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love
thee

Beat
Why then God forgive me

Bene
What offence sweet Beatrice

Beat
You have stayed me in a happy hour I was about to protest I
loved you

Bene
And do it with all thy heart

Beat
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to
protest

Bene
Come bid me do anything for thee

Beat
Kill Claudio

Bene
Ha not for the wide world

Beat
You kill me to deny it Farewell

Bene
Tarry sweet Beatrice

Beat
I am gone though I am hereThere is no love in youNay I
pray you let me go

Bene
Beatrice

Beat
In faith I will go

Bene
Well be friends first

Beat
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy

Bene
Is Claudio thine enemy

Beat
Is a not approved in the height a villain that hath
slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswomanO that I were a
manWhat bear her in hand until they come to take hands and
then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated
rancourO God that I were a man I would eat his heart in the
marketplace

Bene
Hear me Beatrice

Beat
Talk with a man out at a windowa proper saying

Bene
Nay but Beatrice

Beat
Sweet Heroshe is wronged she is slandered she is undone

Bene
Beat

Beat
Princes and Counties Surely a princely testimony a goodly
countconfect a sweet gallant surely O that I were a man
for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my
sake But manhood is melted into courtesies valour into
compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones
too he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie
and swears itI cannot be a man with wishing therefore I
will die a woman with grieving

Bene
Tarry good Beatrice By this hand I love thee

Beat
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it

Bene
Think you in your soul the count Claudio hath wronged Hero

Beat
Yea as sure is I have a thought or a soul

Bene
Enough I am engaged I will challenge him I will kiss your
hand and so I leave you By this hand Claudio shall render me a
dear account As you hear of me so think of me Go comfort
your cousin I must say she is dead and so farewell

Exeunt

ACT V

Scene IBefore Leonatos House

Enter Leonato and Antonio

Ant
If you go on thus you will kill yourself
And t is not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself

Leon
I pray thee cease thy counsel
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve give not me counsel
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
Bring me a father that so lovd his child
Whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine
And bid him speak to me of patience
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain
As thus for thus and such a grief for such
In every lineament branch shape and form
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard
And sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
With candlewasters bring him yet to me
And I of him will gather patience
But there is no such man For brother men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel but tasting it
Their counsel turns to passion which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread
Charm ach with air and agony with words
No no t is all mens office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow
But no mans virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself therefore give me no counsel
My griefs cry louder than advertisement

Ant
Therein do men from children nothing differ

Leon
I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothach patiently
However they have writ the style of gods
And made a push at chance and sufferance

Ant
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
Make those that do offend you suffer too

Leon
There thou speakst reason nay I will do so
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied
And that shall Claudio know so shall the prince
And all of them that thus dishonour her

Enter Don Pedro and Claudio

Ant
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily

D Pedro
Good den good den

Claud
Good day to both of you

Leon
Hear you my lords

D Pedro
We have some haste Leonato

Leon
Some haste my lordwell fare you well my lord
Are you so hasty nowwell all is one

D Pedro
Nay do not quarrel with us good old man

Ant
If he could right himself with quarrelling
Some of us would lie low

Claud
Who wrongs him

Leon
Marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
I fear thee not

Claud
Mary beshrew my hand
If it should give your age such cause of fear
In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword

Leon
Tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young or what would do
Were I not old Know Claudio to thy head
Thou hast so wrongd mine innocent child and me
That I am forcd to lay my reverence by
And with grey hairs and bruise of many days
Do challenge thee to trial of a man
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
And she lies buried with her ancestors
O in a tomb where never scandal slept
Save this of hers framd by thy villany

Claud
My villany

Leon
Thine Claudio thine I say

D Pedro
You say not right old man

Leon
My lord my lord
Ill prove it on his body if he dare
Despite his nice fence and his active practice
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood

Claud
Away I will not have to do with you

Leon
Canst thou so daff me Thou hast killd my child
If thou killst me boy thou shalt kill a man

Ant
He shall kill two of us and men indeed
But thats no matter let him kill one first
Win me and wear melet him answer me
Come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
Sir boy Ill whip you from your foining fence
Nay as I am a gentleman I will

Leon
Brother

Ant
Content yourself God knows I lovd my niece
And she is dead slanderd to death by villains
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue
Boys apes braggarts jacks milksops

Leon
Brother Antony

Ant
Hold your content What man I know them yea
And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
Scambling outfacing fashionmonging boys
That lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
Go anticly show outward hideousness
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words
How they might hurt their enemies if they durst
And this is all

Leon
But brother Antony 

Ant
Come t is no matter
Do not you meddle let me deal in this

D Pedro
Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
My heart is sorry for your daughters death
But on my honour she was chargd with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof

Leon
My lord my lord

D Pedro
I will not hear you

Leon
No
Come brother awayI will be heard

Ant
And shall
Or some of us will smart for it

Exeunt Leonato and Antonio

Bene
In a false quarrel there is no true valour I came to seek

pleasure us

D Pedro

mettle enough in thee to kill care

Bene

D Pedro
By this light he changes more and more I think he be angry

Claud
If he be he knows how to turn his girdle

Bene
Shall I speak a word in your ear

Claud
God bless me from a challenge

Bene
You are a villainI jest notI will make
it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dareDo

sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me hear
from you

Claud

D Pedro

Claud
I faith I thank him he hath bid me to a calfs head and
a capon the which if I do not carve most curiously say my
knifes naughtShall I not find a woodcock too

Bene
Sir your wit ambles well it goes easily

D Pedro
Ill tell thee how Beatrice praisd thy wit the other day I
said thou hadst a fine wit True says she a fine little
one No said I a great wit Right says she a great
gross one Nay said I a good wit Just said she it
hurts nobody Nay said I the gentleman is wise Certain
said she a wise gentleman Nay said I he hath the
tongues That I believe said she for he swore a thing to me
on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning theres a
double tongue theres two tongues Thus did she an hour
together transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she
concluded with a sigh thou wast the properest man in Italy

Claud
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not

D Pedro
Yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not
hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old mans
daughter told us all

Claud
All all and moreover God saw him when he was hid in the
garden

D Pedro
But when shall we set the savage bulls horns on the
sensible Benedicks head

Claud
Yea and text underneath Here dwells Benedick the married
man

Bene
Fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave you now to

courtesies I thank you I must discontinue your company your
brother the bastard is fled from Messina you have among you

Exit Benedick

D Pedro
He is in earnest

Claud
In most profound earnest and Ill warrant you for the
love of Beatrice

D Pedro
And hath challenged thee

Claud
Most sincerely

D Pedro
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and
hose and leaves off his wit

Claud
He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to
such a man

D Pedro
But soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad
Did he not say my brother was fled

Enter Dogberry and Verges and the Watch with Conrade
and Borachio

Dogb
Come you sir if justice cannot tame you she shall neer

Claud
Hearken after their offence my lord

D Pedro
Officers what offence have these men done

Dogb
Marry sir they have committed false report moreover they
have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and
lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified
unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves

D Pedro
First I ask thee what they have done thirdly I ask thee
whats their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed
and to conclude what you lay to their charge

Claud
Rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth
theres one meaning well suited

D Pedro
Who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to
your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be
understood Whats your offence

Bora
Sweet Prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you
hear me and let this count kill me I have deceived even your
very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow
fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me
confessing to this man how Don John your brother insensed me to
slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into the orchard and
saw me court Margaret in Heros garments how you disgraced her
when you should marry her my villany they have upon record
which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
shame the lady is dead upon mine and my masters false
accusation and briefly I desire nothing but the reward of a
villain

D Pedro
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood

Claud
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it

D Pedro
But did my brother set thee on to this

Bora
Yea and paid me richly for the practice of it

D Pedro
He is composd and framd of treachery
And fled he is upon this villany

Claud
Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear
In the rare semblance that I lovd it first

Dogb
Come bring away the plaintiffs By this time our sexton hath
reformed signior Leonato of the matter And masters do not
forget to specify when time and place shall serve that I am an
ass

Verg
Here here comes master signior Leonato and the sexton too

Reenter Leonato and Antonio with the Sexton

Leon
Which is the villain Let me see his eyes
That when I note another man like him
I may avoid him Which of these is he

Bora
If you would know your wronger look on me

Leon
Art thouthouthe slave that with thy breath hast killd
Mine innocent child

Bora
Yea even I alone

Leon
No not so villain thou beliest thyself
Here stand a pair of honourable men
A third is fled that had a hand in it
I thank you princes for my daughters death
Record it with your high and worthy deeds
T was bravely done if you bethink you of it

Claud
I know not how to pray your patience
Yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself
Impose me to what penance your invention
Can lay upon my sin yet sinnd I not
But in mistaking

D Pedro
By my soul nor I
And yet to satisfy this good old man
I would bend under any heavy weight
That hell enjoin me to

Leon
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live
That were impossible but I pray you both
Possess the people in Messina here
How innocent she died and if your love
Can labour aught in sad invention
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
And sing it to her bones sing it tonight
Tomorrow morning come you to my house
And since you could not be my soninlaw
Be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter
Almost the copy of my child thats dead
And she alone is heir to both of us
Give her the right you should have given her cousin
And so dies my revenge

Claud
O noble sir
Your over kindness doth wring tears from me
I do embrace your offer and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio

Leon
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming
Tonight I take my leaveThis naughty man
Shall fact to face be brought to Margaret
Who I believe was packd in all this wrong
Hird to it by your brother

Bora
No by my soul she was not
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me
But always hath been just and virtuous
In anything that I do know by her

Dogb
Moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this
plaintiff here the offender did call me ass I beseech you let
it be remembered in his punishment And also the watch heard them
talk of one Deformed they say he wears a key in his ear and a
lock hanging by it and borrows money in Gods name the which he
hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hardhearted
and will lend nothing for Gods sake Pray you examine him upon
that point

Leon
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains

Dogb
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth
and I praise God for you

Leon
Theres for thy pains

Dogb
God save the foundation

Leon
Go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee

Dogb
I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech
your worship to correct yourself for the example of others
God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you
to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry
meeting may be wished God prohibit itCome neighbour

Scene IILeonatos Garden

Enter Benedick and Margaret meeting

Bene
Pray thee sweet mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands
by helping me to the speech of Beatrice

Marg
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty

Bene
In so high a style Margaret that no man living shall come
over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it

Marg
To have no man come over me why shall I always keep below
stairs

Bene
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth it catches

Marg
And yours as blunt as the fencers foils which hit but hurt
not

Bene
A most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman
and so I pray thee call Beatrice I give thee the bucklers

Marg
Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own

Bene
If you use them Margaret you must put in the pikes with a
vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids

Marg
Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs

Exit Margaret

Bene
And therefore will come

 The god of love Singing
 That sits above
 And knows me and knows me
 How pitiful I deserve

I mean in singing but in lovingLeander the good swimmer
Troilus the first employer of panders and a whole book full of
these quondam carpetmongers whose names yet run smoothly in the
even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned
over and over as my poor self in love Marry I cannot show it in
rhyme I have tried I can find out no rhyme to lady but
baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for
school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings No I
was not born under a rhyming planet nor cannot woo in festival
terms

Enter Beatrice

Sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called thee

Beat
Yea signior and depart when you bid me

Bene
O stay but till then

Beat
Then is spoken fare you well nowand yet ere I go let
me go with that I came for which is with knowing what hath
passed between you and Claudio

Bene
Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee

Beat
Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul
breath and foul breath is noisome therefore I will depart
unkissed

Bene
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so
forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee plainly Claudio
undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him
or I will subscribe him a coward And I pray thee now tell me
for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me

Beat
For them all together which maintained so politic a state of
evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
them But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love
for me

Bene
Suffer love a good epithet I do suffer love indeed for I
love thee against my will

Beat
In spite of your heart I think alas poor heart If you
spite it for my sake I will spite it for yours for I will never
love that which my friend hates

Bene
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably

Beat
It appears not in this confession theres not one wise man
among twenty that will praise himself

Bene
An old an old instance Beatrice that lived in the time of
good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb
ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bells
ring and the widow weeps

Beat
And how long is that think you

Bene
QuestionWhy an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don Worm his
conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the
trumpet of his own virtues as I am to myself So much for
praising myself who I myself will bear witness is
praiseworthy and now tell me How doth your cousin

Beat
Very ill

Bene
And how do you

Beat
Very ill too

Bene
Serve God love me and mend there will I leave you too for
here comes one in haste

Enter Ursula

Urs
Madam you must come to your uncle yonders old coil at home
it is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused the prince
and Claudio mightily abused and don John is the author of all
who is fled and gone will you come presently

Beat
Will you go hear this news signior

Bene
I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy
eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncles

Exeunt



Scene IIIThe Inside of a Church

Enter Don Pedro Claudio and Attendants with music and
tapers

Claud
Is this the monument of Leonato

Atten
It is my lord

Claud
reads from a scroll

 Done to death by slanderous tongues
 Was the Hero that here lies
 Death in guerdon of her wrongs
 Gives her fame which never dies
 So the life that died with shame
 Lives in death with glorious fame

 Hang thou there upon the tomb
 Praising her when I am dumb

Now music sound and sing your solemn hymn

Song

 Pardon Goddess of the night
 Those that slew thy virgin knight
 For the which with songs of woe
 Round about her tomb they go
 Midnight assist our moan
 Help us to sigh and groan
 Heavily heavily
 Graves yawn and yield your dead
 Till death be uttered
 Heavenly heavenly

Claud
Now unto thy bones good night
Yearly will I do this rite

D Pedro
Good morrow masters put your torches out
The wolves have preyd and look the gentle day
Before the wheels of Phoebus round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
Thanks to you all and leave us fare you well

Claud
Good morrow masters each his several way

D Pedro
Come let us hence and put on other weeds
And then to Leonatos we will go

Claud
And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds
Than this for whom we rendred up this woe

Exeunt

And all Europa shall rejoice at thee
As once Europa did at lusty Jove
When he would play the noble beast in love

Bene

And some such strange bull leapd your fathers cow
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you for you have just his bleat

Reenter Antonio with the Ladies masked

Claud

Which is the lady I must seize upon

Ant
This same is she and I do give you her

Claud
Why then shes mine Sweet let me see your face

Leon
No that you shall not till you take her hand
Before this friar and swear to marry her

Claud
Give me your hand before this holy friar
I am your husband if you like of me

Hero
And when I livd I was your other wife
Unmasking
And when you lovd you were my other husband

Claud
Another Hero

Hero
Nothing certainer
One Hero died defild but I do live
And surely as I live I am a maid

D Pedro
The former Hero Hero that is dead

Leon
She died my lord but whiles her slander livd

Friar
All this amazement can I qualify
When after that the holy rites are ended
Ill tell you largely of fair Heros death
Meantime let wonder seem familiar
And to the chapel let us presently

Bene
Soft and fair friarWhich is Beatrice

Beat
I answer to that name Unmasking what is your will

Bene
Do not you love me

Beat
Why no no more than reason

Bene
Why then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
Have been deceived for they swore you did

Beat
Do not you love me

Bene
Troth no no more than reason

Beat
Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Are much deceivd for they did swear you did

Bene
They swore that you were almost sick for me

Beat
They swore that you were wellnigh dead for me

Bene
T is no such matterThen you do not love me

Beat
No truly but in friendly recompense

Leon
Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman

Claud
And Ill be sworn upont that he loves her
For heres a paper written in his hand
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain
Fashiond to Beatrice

Hero
And heres another
Writ in my cousins hand stolen from her pocket
Containing her affection unto Benedick

Bene
A miracle heres our own hands against our heartsCome
I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pity

Beat
I would not deny youbut by this good day I yield upon
great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told
you were in a consumption

Bene
Peace I will stop your mouth

Kissing her

D Pedro
How dost thou Benedick the married man

Beat
Ill tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannot
flout me out of my humour Dost thou think I care for a satire
or an epigram No if a man will be beaten with brains he shall
wear nothing handsome about him In brief since I do purpose to
marry I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my
conclusionFor thy part Claudio I did think to have beaten
thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruisd
and love my cousin

Claud
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice that I
might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a
double dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin
do not look exceeding narrowly to thee

Bene
Come come we are friendslets have a dance ere we are
married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives
heels

Leon
Well have dancing afterwards

Bene
First o my word therefore play music
Prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is
no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn

Enter a Messenger

Mess
My lord your brother John is taen in flight
And brought with armed men back to Messina

Bene
Think not on him till tomorrow Ill devise thee brave
punishments for himStrike up pipers

Dance

Exeunt
