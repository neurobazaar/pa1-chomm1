THE RECREATION OF BRIAN KENT


By Harold Bell Wright



DEAR AUNTIE SUE

I have wondered many times while writing this simple story of life and
love if you would ever forgive me for putting you in a book I hope you
will because if you do not I shall be heartbroken and you wouldnt
want me that way would you Auntie Sue

I fancy I can hear you say But Harold how COULD you You know I
never did the things you have made me do in your story You know I never
lived in a little log house by the river in the Ozark Mountains What in
the world will people think

Well to tell the truth dear I dont care so very much what people
think if only they will love you and that they are sure to do
becausewell just becauseYou must remember too that you will
be eightyseven years old the eighteenth of next November and it is
therefore quite time that someone put you in a book

And after all Auntie Sue are you very sure that you have never lived
in a little log house by the riverare you very sure Auntie Sue

Forgive my impertinence as you have always forgiven me everything
and love me just the same because I have written only in love of the
dearest Auntie Sue in the world

 And see the rivers how they run
 Through woods and meads in shade and sun
 Sometimes swift sometimes slow
 Wave succeeding wave they go
 A various journey to the deep
 Like human life to endless sleep

CHAPTER I

A REMARKABLE WOMAN


I remember as well as though it were yesterday the first time I met
Auntie Sue

It happened during my first roaming visit to the Ozarks when I had
wandered by chance one day into the Elbow Rock neighborhood Twenty
years it was at least before the time of this story She was standing
in the door of her little schoolhouse the ruins of which you may still
see halfway up the long hill from the log house by the river where the
most of this story was lived

It was that season of the year when the gold and brown of our Ozark
Hills is overlaid with a filmy veil of delicate blue haze and the world
is hushed with the solemn sweetness of the passing of the summer And as
the old gentlewoman stood there in the open door of that rustic temple
of learning with the deepshadowed wooded hillside in the background
and in front the rude clearing with its crooked rail fence along which
the scarlet sumac flamed I thoughtas I still think after all these
yearsthat I had never before seen such a woman

Fifty years had gone into the making of that sterling character which
was builded upon a foundation of many generations of noble ancestors
Without home or children of her own the life strength of her splendid
womanhood had been given to the teaching of boys and girls An oldmaid
schoolteacher Yesif you will But as I saw her standing there that
daytall and slender dressed in a simple gown that was fitting to her
workthere was a queenly dignity a stately sweetness in her bearing
that made me feel somehow as if I had come unexpectedly into the
presence of royalty Not the royalty of caste and court and station with
their glittering pretenses of superiority and their superficial claims
to distinctionI do not mean that I mean that true royalty which
needs no caste or court or station but makes itself felt because it IS

She did not notice me at first for the noise of the children at play in
the yard covered the sound of my approach and she was looking far far
away over the river which lay below at the foot of the hill over the
forestclad mountains in the glory of their brown and gold over the
vast sweep of the treecrowned Ozark ridges that receded wave after wave
into the blue haze until in the vastness of the distant sky they were
lost And something made me know that in the moments respite from her
task the woman was looking even beyond the sky itself

Her profile cleanchiselled but daintily formed was beautiful in its
gentle strength Her hair was soft and silvery like the gray mist of the
river in the morning Then she turned to greet me and I saw her eyes
Boy that I was then and not given overmuch to serious thought I knew
that the high unwavering purpose the loving sympathy and tender
understanding that shone in the calm depth of those eyes could belong
only to one who habitually looks unafraid beyond all earthly scenes
Only those who have learned thus to look beyond the material horizon of
our little day have that beautiful inner light which shone in the eyes
of Auntie Suethe teacher of a backwoods school

Auntie Sue had come to the Elbow Rock neighborhood the summer preceding
that fall when I first met her She had grown too old she said with
her delightful little laugh to be of much use in the larger schools of
the more thickly populated sections of the country But she was still
far too young she stoutly maintained to be altogether useless

Tom Warden who lived just over the ridge from the schoolhouse and
who was blessed with the largest wife the largest family and the most
pretentious farm in the county had kinsfolk somewhere in Illinois
Through these relatives of the Ozark farmer Miss Susan Wakefield had
learned of the needs of the Elbow Rock school and so finally had
come into the hills It was the influential Tom who secured for her the
modest position It was the motherly Mrs Tom who made her at home in
the Warden household It was the Warden boys and girls who first called
her Auntie Sue But it was Auntie Sue herself who won so large a place
in the hearts of the simple mountain folk of the district that she
held her position year after year until she finally gave up teaching
altogether

Not one of her Ozark friends ever came to know in detail the history of
this remarkable womans life It was known in a general way that she
was born in Connecticut that she had a brother somewhere in some
SouthAmerican country that two other brothers had been killed in the
Civil War that she had taught in the lower and intermediate grades of
public schools in various places all the years of her womanhood Also
it was known that she had never married

And that said Uncle Lige Potter voicing the unanimous opinion
of the countryside is a doggone funny thing and plumb unnatural
considerin the kind of woman she is

To which Lem Jordanwho was then living with his fourth wife and
might therefore be held to speak with a degree of authorityadded
Hit sure is a dad burned shame an a plumb disgrace to the men of this
here country when you come to look at the sort of wimmen most of em
are a marryin most of the time

Another matter of universal and neverfailing interest to the mountain
folk was the unprecedented number of letters that Auntie Sue received
and wrote That some of these letters written by their backwoods teacher
were addressed to men and women of such prominence in the world that
their names were known even to that remote Ozark district was a source
of no little pride to Auntie Sues immediate neighbors and served to
mark her in their eyes with no small distinction

It was during the fourth year of her life amid the scenes of this
storyas I recall timethat Auntie Sue invested the small savings
of her working years in the little log house by the river and the eighty
acres of land known as the Old Bill Wilson place

The house was a substantial building of three rooms a leanto kitchen
and a porch overlooking the river The log barn with Prince a gentle
old horse and Bess a mildmannered brindle cow completed the
modest establishment About thirty acres of the land were cleared and
under cultivation of a sort The remaining acreage was in timber
The price under the kindly and expert supervision of Tom Warden was
fifteen dollars an acre But Auntie Sue always laughingly insisted that
she really paid fifty cents an acre for the land and fourteen dollars
and a half an acre for the sunsets

The tillable land except for the garden she let out on shares
always under the friendly guardianship of neighbor Tom while Toms boys
cared for the little garden in season and saw to it that the woodpile
was always ample and ready for the stove And in addition to these
fixed and regular homely services there were many offerings of helpful
hands whenever other needs arose for as time passed there came to be
in all the Elbow Rock district scarce a man young or old who did not
now and then honor himself by doing some little job for Auntie Sue
while the women and girls in the same neighborly spirit brought from
their own humble households many tokens of their loving thoughtfulness
And never did one visit that little log house by the river without
the consciousness of something received from the silveryhaired old
teachera something intangible perhaps which they could not have
expressed in words but which nevertheless enriched the lives of
those simple mountain people with a very real joy and a very tangible
happiness

For six years Auntie Sue continued teaching the Elbow Rock
schoolclimbing the hill in the morning from her log house by the
river to the cabin schoolhouse in the clearing on the mountainside
above returning in the late afternoon when her days work was over
down the winding road to her little home there to watch from the porch
that overlooked the river the sunset in the evening And every year the
daily climb grew a little harder the days of work grew a little longer
she went down the hill in the afternoon a little slower And every year
the sunsets were to her eyes more beautiful the evening skies to her
understanding glowed with richer meaning the twilight hours filled her
heart with a deeper peace

And so at last her teaching days were over that is she taught no
more in the log schoolhouse in the clearing on the mountainside But
in her little home beside the river she continued her work not from
textbooks indeed but as all such souls must continue to teach until
the sun sets for the last time upon their mortal days

Workworn toilhardened mountaineer mothers whose narrow world denied
them so many of the finer thoughts and things came to counsel with
this childless woman and to learn from her a little of the art of
contentment and happiness Strong men of rude dress and speech whose
lives were as rough as the hills in which they were reared and whose
thoughts were often as crude as their halfsavage and sometimes lawless
customs came to sit at the feet of this gentle one who received them
all with such kindly interest and instinctive understanding And young
men and girls came drawn by the magic that was hers to confide in
this woman who listened with such rare tact and loving sympathy to their
troubles and their dreams and who in the deepest things of their young
lives was mother to them all

Nor were the mountain folk her only disciples Always there were the
letters she continued to write addressed to almost every corner of
the land And every year there would come for a week or a month at
different times during the summer men and women from the great world of
larger affairs who had need of the strength and courage and patience and
hope they never failed to find in that little log house by the river
And so in time it came to be known that those letters written by
Auntie Sue went to men and women who in their childhood school days
had received from her their first lessons in writing and that her
visitors many of them distinguished in the world of railroads and
cities were of that large circle of busy souls who had never ceased to
be her pupils

Thus it came that the garden was made a little larger and two rooms
were added to the house with other modest improvements to accommodate
Auntie Sues grownup boys and girls when they came to visit her But
never was there a hired servant so that her guests must do their own
household tasks because Auntie Sue said that was good for them and
mostly what they needed

It should also be said here that among her many pupils who lived beyond
the skyline of the far blue hills not one knew more of the
real secret of Auntie Sues life and character than did the Ozark
mountaineers of the Elbow Rock district among whom she had chosen to
pass the evening of her day

Then came one who learned the secret He learnedbut that is my story
I must not tell the secret here



CHAPTER II

THE MAN IN THE DARK


A man stood at a window looking out into the night There was no light
in the room The stars were hidden behind a thick curtain of sullen
clouds

The house was a wretchedly constructed longneglected building of
a type common to those old river towns that in their many years of
uselessness have lost all civic pride and in their own resultant
squalor and filth have buried their selfrespect A dingy scarcely
legible sign over the treacherous board walk in front by the sickly
light of a smokegrimed kerosene lantern announced that the place was a
hotel

Dark as it was the man at the window could see the river The trees
that lined the bank opposite the town were mere ghostly shadows against
the gloomy masses of the low hills that rose from the waters edge
indistinct mysterious and unreal into the threatening sky The higher
mountains that reared their crests beyond the hills were invisible The
stream itself swept sullenly through the nighta resistless flood of
dismal power as if turbid with wrecked souls with the lost hopes and
ruined dreams of men it was fit only to bear vessels freighted with
sorrow misfortune and despair

The manner of the man at the window was as if some woeful spirit of the
melancholy scene were calling him With head bowed and face turned a
little to one side he listened intently as one listens to voices that
are muffled and indistinct He pressed his face close to the glass and
with straining eyes tried to see more clearly the ghostly trees the
sombre hills and the gloomy river Three times he turned from the
window to pace to and fro in the darkened room and every time his steps
brought him again to the casement as if in obedience to some insistent
voice that summoned him The fourth time he turned from the window more
quickly with a gesture of assenting decision

The crackling snap of a match broke the dead stillness The sudden flare
of light stabbed the darkness As he applied the tiny wavering flame
to the wick of a lamp that stood on the cheap oldfashioned bureau the
mans hand shook until the chimney rattled against the wire standards of
the burner Turning quickly from the lighted lamp the man sprang again
to the window to jerk down the tattered old shade Facing about he
stood with his back to the wall searching the room with wide fearful
eyes His fists were clenched His chest rose and fell heavily with his
labored breathing His face worked with emotion With trembling limbs
and twitching muscles he crouched like some desperate creature at bay

But save for the wretched man himself there was in that shabby
dingypapered dirtycarpeted poorly furnished apartment no living
thing

Suddenly the man laughedand it was the reckless despairing laughter
of a soul that feels itself slipping over the brink of an abyss

With hurried step and outstretched hands he crossed the room to snatch
a bottle of whisky from its place beside the lamp on the bureau With
trembling eagerness he poured a water tumbler halffull of the red
liquor As one dying of thirst he drank Drawing a deep breath and
shaking his head with a wry smile he spoke in hoarse confidence to the
image of himself in the dingy mirror They nearly had me that time
Again he poured and drank

The whisky steadied him for the moment and with bottle and glass still
in hand he regarded himself in the mirror with critical interest

Had he stood erect with the vigor that should have been his by right of
his years the man would have measured just short of six feet but his
shouldersnaturally well setsagged with the weariness of excessive
physical indulgence while the sunken chest the emaciated limbs and
the dejected posture of his misused body made him in appearance at
least a wretched weakling His clothingof good material and well
tailoredwas disgustingly soiled and neglectedthe shoes thickly
coated with dried mud and the oncewhite shirt slovenly unfastened at
the throat without collar or tie The face which looked back from the
mirror to the man was without question the countenance of a gentleman
but the broad forehead under the unkempt redbrown hair was furrowed
with anxiety the unshaven cheeks were lined and sunken the finely
shaped sensitive mouth drooped with nervous weakness and the blue
wellplaced eyes were bloodshot and glittering with the light of
nearinsanity

The poor creature looked at the hideous image of his ruined self as
if fascinated with the horror of that which had been somehow wrought
Slowly as one in a trance he went closer and without moving his gaze
from the mirror placed the bottle and tumbler upon the bureau As if
compelled by those burning eyes that stared so fixedly at him he leaned
forward still closer to the glass Then as he looked the distorted
features twitched and worked grotesquely with uncontrollable emotions
while the quivering lips formed words that were not even whispered With
trembling fingers he felt the unshaven cheeks and touched the unkempt
hair questioningly Suddenly as if to shut out the horror of that which
he saw in the mirror the man hid his face in his hands and with a
sobbing inarticulate cry sank to the floor

Silently with pitiless force the river swept onward through the night
following its ordained way to the mighty sea

As if summoned again by some dark spirit that brooded over the sombre
rushing flood the man rose heavily to his feet His face turned once
more toward the window A moment he stood there listening listening
then wheeling back to the whisky bottle and the glass on the bureau he
quickly poured and drank again

Nodding his head in the manner of one reaching a conclusion he looked
slowly about the room while a frightful grin of hopeless despairing
triumph twisted his features and his lips moved as if he breathed
reckless defiance to an invisible ghostly company

Moving now with a decision and purpose that suggested a native
strength of character the man quickly packed a suitcase with various
articles of clothing from the bureau drawers and the closet He was in
the act of closing the suitcase when he stopped suddenly and with
a shrug of his shoulders turned away Then as if struck by another
thought he stooped again over his baggage and drew forth a fresh
untouched bottle of whisky

I guess you are the only baggage Ill need where I am going he said
whimsically and leaving the open suitcase where it lay he crossed
the room and extinguished the light Cautiously he unlocked and opened
the door For a moment he stood listening Then with the bottle hidden
under his coat he stole softly from the room

A few minutes later the man stood out there in the night on the bank
of the river Behind him the outlines of the scattered houses that made
the little town were lost against the dusk of the hillside From the
ghostly treeshadows that marked the opposite bank the solemn hills
rose out of the deeper darkness of the lowlands that edged the stream
in sombre mystery There was no break in the heavy clouds to permit the
gleam of a friendly star There was no sound save the soft swish of the
water against the bank where he stood the chirping of a bird in the
nearby willows and the occasional splash of a leaping fish or water
animal But to the man there was a feeling of sound To the lonely human
wreck standing there in the darkness the river calledcalled with
fearful insistent power

From under the black wall of the night the dreadful flood swept out of
the Somewhere of its beginning Past the man the river poured its mighty
strength with resistless smoothly flowing terrible force Into the
darkness it swept on its awful way to the Nowhere of its ending For
uncounted ages the river had poured itself thus between those walls of
hills For untold ages to come until the end of time itself the stream
would continue to pour its strength past that spot where the man stood

Out of the night the voice of the river had called to the man as he
stood at the window of his darkened room And the man had come now to
answer the call Cautiously he went down the bank toward the edge of
the dark swirling water His purpose was unmistakable Nor was there
any hint of faltering now in his manner He had reached his decision
He knew what he had come to do

The mans feet were feeling the mud at the margin of the stream when his
legs touched something and a low rattling sound startled him Then
he remembered A skiff was moored there and he had brushed against the
chain that led from the bow of the boat to the stump of a willow higher
up on the bank The man had seen the skiffa rude flatbottomed
little craft known to the Ozark natives as a Johnboatjust before
sunset that evening But there had been no boat in his thoughts when he
had come to answer the call of the river and in the preoccupation of
his mind as he stood there in the night beside the stream he had not
noticed it as it lay so nearly invisible in the darkness Mechanically
he stooped to feel the chain with his free hand A moment later he had
placed his bottle of whisky carefully in the boat and was loosing the
chain painter from the willow stump

Why not he said to himself It will be easier in midstreamand
more certain

Carefully so that no sound should break the stillness he stowed the
chain in the bow and then worked the skiff around until it pointed out
into the stream Then with his hands grasping the sides of the little
craft and the weight of his body on one knee in the stern he pushed
vigorously with his free foot against the bank and so was carried well
out from the shore As the boat lost its momentum the strong current
caught it and whirled it away down the river

Groping in the darkness the man found his bottle of whisky and working
the cork out with his pocketknife drank long and deep

Already save for a single light the town was lost in the night As
the man watched that red spot on the black wall the stream swung
his drifting boat around a bend and the light vanished The dreadful
mystery of the river drew close The world of men was far very far
away Centuries ago the man had faced himself in the mirror and had
obeyed the voice that summoned him into the darkness In fancy now he
saw his empty boat swept on and on Through what varied scenes would it
drift To what port would the mysterious will of the river carry it To
what end would it at last come in its helplessness

And the man himselfthe human soulcraftwhat of him As he had
pushed his material boat out into the stream to drift unguided and
helpless so presently he would push himself out from the shore of
all that men call life Through what scenes would he drift To what port
would the will of an awful invisible stream carry him To what end would
he finally come in his helplessness

Again the man drankand again

And then with face upturned to the leaden clouds he laughed
aloudlaughed until the ghostly shores gave back his laughter and the
voices of the night were hushed and still

The laughter ended with a wild reckless defiant yell

Springing to his feet in the drifting boat the man shook his clenched
fist at the darkness and with insane fury cursed the life he had left
behind

The current whirled the boat around and the man faced down the stream
He laughed again and lifting his bottle high uttered a reckless
profane toast to the unknown toward which he was being carried by the
river in the night



CHAPTER III

A MISSING LETTER


Auntie Sues little log house by the river was placed some five
hundred yards back from the stream on a bench of land at the foot
of Schoolhouse Hill From this bench the ground slopes gently to the
riverbank which at this point is sheer and high enough to be well
above the water at flood periods The road winding down the hill
turns to the right at the foot of the steep grade and leads away up the
river and between the road and the river on the upstream side of the
house was the garden

At the lower corner of the garden farthest from the house the strong
current had cut a deep inward curve in the high shoreline forming thus
an eddy which was margined on one side at a normal stage of water by
a narrow shelf of land between the waters edge and the foot of the
main bank A flight of rude steps led down from the garden above to this
natural landing which for three miles up and down the river was
the only point on Auntie Sues side of the stream where one could go
ashore from a skiff

From the porch of the house one facing up the river looked over the
gently sloping garden over the eddy lying under the high bank and away
over a beautiful reach of water known as The Benda wide sweeping
curve which a mile distant is lost behind a wooded bluff where at
times during the vacation or hunting season one might see the smoke
from the stone chimney of a clubhouse which was built and used by people
who lived in the big noisy city many miles from the peaceful Ozark
scene From the shore of The Bend opposite and above Auntie Sues
place beyond the willows that fringe the waters edge the low
bottomlands extend back threequarters of a mile to the foot of a
heavily timbered ridge beyond which rise the higher hills But directly
across from Auntie Sues house this ridge curves sharply toward the
stream while less than a quarter of a mile below a mighty mountainarm
is thrust out from a shoulder of Schoolhouse Hill as if to bar
the rivers way The high bluff thus formed is known to the natives
throughout all that region as Elbow Rock

The quiet waters of The Bend move so gently on their broad course that
from the porch looking up the stream the eye could scarcely mark the
current But in front of the little log house where the restraining
banks of the river draw closer together the lazy current awakens to
quickening movement Looking down the stream one could see the waters
leaving the broad and quiet reaches of The Bend above and rushing away
with fast increasing speed between the narrowing banks until in all
their vicious might they dashed full against the Elbow Rock cliff
where boiling and tossing in mad fury they roared away at a right
angle and so around the point and on to another quiet stretch below And
many were the tales of stirring adventure and tragic accident at this
dangerous point of the rivers journey to the faraway sea Skilled
rivermen by holding their Johnboats and canoes close to the far
shore might run the rapids with safety But no boat once caught in the
vicious grip of the main current between the comparatively still waters
of The Bend and that wild roaring tumult at Elbow Rock had ever
survived

It was nearing the close of a late summer day and Auntie Sue as was
her custom stood on the porch watching the sunset In the vast field of
sky that arched above the softly rounded hills there was not a cloud
No wind stirred the leaves of the farreaching forests or marred
the bright waters of the quiet Bend that mirrored back the green
treefringed banks and blueshadowed mountains Faintly through the
hush from beyond the bottomlands on the other side of the stream came
the longdrawn Whoee Whoee of farmer Jackson calling his hogs
From the hillside back of the house sounded the deep mellow tones of
a cowbell telling Auntie Sue that neighbor Toms cattle were going home
from their woodland pastures A company of crows crossed the river on
leisure wing toward some evening rendezvous A waterfowl flapped slowly
up the stream And here and there the swallows wheeled in graceful
circles above the gleaming Bend or dipped flashlike to break the
silvery surface As the blue of the mountains deepened to purple and
the rosy light from below the western hills flushed the sky the silver
sheen of the quiet water changed with the changing tints above and the
shadows of the trees along the bank deepened until the shoreline was
lost in the dusk of the coming night

And even as the river gave back the light of the sky and the color of
the mountains so the gentle face of the grayhaired woman who watched
with such loving reverence reflected the beauty of the scene The peace
and quiet of the evening of her life was as the still loveliness of that
twilight hour

And yet there was a suggestion of pathos in the loneliness of the
slender figure standing there Now and again she clasped her delicate
hands to her breast as if moved by emotions of a toopoignant sweetness
while in her eyes shone the soft light of fondest memories and dearest
dreams Several times she turned her head to look about as if wishing
for some one to share with her the beauty that moved her so At last
she called and her voice low and puretoned had in it the quality
that was in the light of her eyes

Judy Judy dear Do come and see this wonderful wonderful sky

From within the house a shrill querulous drawling voice so
characteristic of the Southern poorwhite mountaineer answered
Whaat

A quick little smile deepened the crowsfeet at the corners of Auntie
Sues eyes as she called again with gentle patience Do come and see
the sunset Judy dear It is so beautiful And this time in answer
Judy appeared in the doorway

From appearances the poor creatures age might have been anywhere from
fifteen to thirtyfive for the twisted and misshapen body angular and
hard the scrawny wry neck the oldyoung face thin and sallow with
furtive beadyblack eyes gave no hint of her years As a matter of
fact I happened to know that Judith Taylor daughter of the notorious
Ozark moonshiner Jap Taylor was just past twenty the year she went to
live with Auntie Sue

Looking obliquely at the old gentlewoman with a curious expression of
mingled defiance suspicion and affection on her almost vicious face
Judy drawled Was youall ayellin for me

Yes Judy I want you to help me watch the sunset Auntie Sue
answered with bright animation and turning she pointed toward the
glowing westLook

Judys sly evasive eyes did not cease to regard the illumined face of
her old companion as she returned in her dry highpitched monotone I
dont reckon as how youall are aneedin much help seein as how you
are allus awatchin hit A bodyd think youall was mighty nigh old
nough by now ter look at hit alone

Auntie Sue laughed a low musical chuckling laugh and with a hint
of loving impatience in her gentle voice replied to Judys observation
But dont you understand child It adds so to ones happiness
to share lovely scenes like this It makes it all so muchso
muchwellBIGGER to have some one enjoy it with you Come dear
And she held out her hand with a gesture of entreaty and a look
of yearning upon her dear old face that no human being could have
withstood

Judy still slyly watchful went cautiously nearer and Auntie Sue
putting an arm lovingly about the crooked shoulders of the mountain
girl pointed again toward the west as she said in a low voice that
vibrated with emotion Look Judy Look

The black eyes shifted and the oldyoung expressionless face turned
toward the landscape which lay before them in all its wondrous beauty
of glowing sky and tinted mountain and gleaming river And there might
have been a faint touch of softness now in the querulous monotone
as Judy said I cant see as how hit could be ary bigger Haint ary
reason as I kin see why hit should be ary bigger if hit could Lord
knows theres nough of hit as t is rough nough too as youall d
sure know if youall had ter trapse over them there hills all yer life
like Ive had ter

But isnt it wonderful tonight Judy It seems to me I have never
seen it so perfect

Hits just like hits allus been so far as I kin see ceptin
that the rivers higher in the spring an more muddier returned
the mountain girl I was borned over there on yon side that there
flattopped mountain nigh the mouth of Red Creek I growed up on the
river mostlylearned ter swim an paddle er Johnboat fore I kin
remember Red Creek hit heads over there behind that there long ridge
in Injin Holler Theres a still

She checked herself suddenly and shot a fearful sidewise look at Auntie
Sue then turned and pointed in the opposite direction with a pretense
of excited interest Look down there mam See how black the old river
is where she smashes inter Elbow Rock an how white them waves be where
the water biles an throws hitself Hitd sure git you if you was ter
git ketched in there with er Johnboat wouldnt hit Listen mam You
kin hear hit aroarin like hit was mad cant you

But the older woman turned to face again the quiet reaches of The
Bend

I think I like The Bend best though Judy See how perfectly those
trees and hills are mirrored in the river and how the water holds
the color of the sky Dont you think God is good to make the world so
beautiful for us child

Beautiful cried poor deformed Judy in a voice that shrilled in
vicious protest If there is a God like youall are allus atalkin
bout an if He sure nough made them things like youall sees em He
sure haint toted fair with me

Hush Judy pleaded Auntie Sue Please dont child

But the mountain girl rebelliously continued Look at me Just look at
me If that there God of yourn is so allfired good what did He go an
let my pap git drunk for an beat me like he done when I was a baby
an make me grow up all crooked like what I be Good Hell A dad
burned ornery kind of a God I call Him

For some time Auntie Sue did not speak but stood with her face
upturned to the sky Then the low gentle voice again broke the silence
See Judy dear the light is almost gone now and there is not a cloud
anywhere Yesterday evening you remember we could not see the sunset
at all the clouds were so heavy and solid The moon will be lovely
tonight I think I shall wait for it

Youall best set down then said Judy speaking again in her
querulous drawling monotone Ill fetch a chair She brought a
comfortable rustic rockingchair from the farther end of the porch then
disappeared into the house to return a moment later with a heavy shawl
Hitll be aturnin cold directly now the suns plumb down she said
an youall mustnt get to chillin nohow

Auntie Sue thanked her with gentle courtesy and reaching up caught
the girls hand as Judy was awkwardly arranging the wrap about the thin
old shoulders Wont you bring a chair for yourself and sit with
me awhile dear As she spoke Auntie Sue patted the hard bony hand
caressingly

But Judy pulled her hand away roughly saying Youall aint got no
call ter do sich as that ter me Ill set awhile with you but I aint
aneedin no chair And with that she seated herself on the floor her
back against the wall of the house

The last of the evening was gone from the sky now The soft darkness of
a clear starlight night lay over the land A gentle breeze stole over
the mountains rustled softly through the forest and drifting across
the river touched Auntie Sues silvery hair

Judy was first to break the silence I took notice neighbor Tom brung
youall a right smart bunch of letter mail this evenin she said
curiously

There was a troubled note in Auntie Sues gentle voice as she returned
The letter from the bank did not come Judy

Hit didnt

No and Judy it is nearly four weeks now since I sent them that
money I cant understand it

I was plumb scared at the time you oughten ter sent hit just in
er letter that away Hit sure looked like a heap of money ter be
atrustin them there ornery postoffice fellers with even if hit was
funny newfangled money like that there was Why mam you take old
Tod Stimson down at the Ferry now an that old devild steal anythin
what warnt too much trouble for him ter lift

Argentine notes the money was Judy I felt sure that it would be all
right because you know Brother John sent it just in a letter all the
way from Buenos Aires And you remember I folded it up in extra heavy
paper and put it in two envelopes one over the other and mailed it at
Thompsonville with my own hands

Hit sure looks like hit ought ter be safe er nough so long as hit
warnt mailed at the Ferry where old Stimson could git his hands on
hit agreed Judy

Then after a silence of several minutes she added in a more
reassuring voice I reckon as how hitll be all right mam I wouldnt
worry myself if I was you That there bankplace like as not gits er
right smart lot of letters an hit stands ter reason the feller just
naturally cant write back ter evrybody at once

Of course agreed Auntie Sue It is just some delay in their
acknowledgment that is all Perhaps they are waiting to find out if the
notes are genuine or it may be that their letter to me went astray and
will have to be returned to them and then remailed all over again I
feel sure I shall hear from them in a few days

So they talked until the moon appeared from behind the dark mountains
that against her light were silhouetted on the sky And as the old
gentlewoman watched the queen of the night rising higher and higher
on her royal course and saw the dusky landscape transformed to a
fairyscene of ethereal loveliness Auntie Sue forgot the letter that
had not come

With the enthusiasm that never failed her the silveryhaired teacher
tried to give the backwoods girl a little of her wealth of vision But
though they looked at the same landscape the eyes of twenty could
not see that which was so clear to the eyes of seventy Poor Judy The
river sweeping on its winding way through the hills from the springs
of its faraway beginnings to the ocean of its final endeavorin all
its varied moods and changesin all its beauty and its irresistible
powerthe river could never mean to Judy what it meant to Auntie Sue

Hit sure is er fine night for to go possum huntin said the girl at
last getting to her feet and standing in her twisted attitude with her
wry neck holding her head to one side Them there Jackson boysll sure
be out

Auntie Sue laughed her low chuckling laugh

From the edge of the timber that borders the fields of the bottomlands
across the river came the baying of hounds There they be now said
Judy Hear em The Billingses cross from the clubhouse ll be out
too I reckon When hits moonlight theyre allus ahuntin possum
an coon When hits dark theyre out on the river agiggin for fish
Well I reckon Ill be agoin in now mam she concluded with a
yawn Aint no use in a body stayin up when there aint nothin ter do
but ter sleep as I kin see

With an awkward return to Auntie Sues Goodnight and sweet dreams
dear the mountain girl went into the house

For an hour longer the old gentlewoman sat on the porch of her little
log house by the river looking out over the moonlit scene Nor did she
now as when she had watched the sunset crave human companionship In
spirit she was far from all earthly needs or careswhere no troubled
thoughts could disturb her serene peace and her dearest dreams were
real

The missing letter was forgotten



CHAPTER IV

THE WILL OF THE RIVER


Had Auntie Sue remained a few minutes longer on the porch that evening
she might have seen an object drifting down the river in the gentle
current of The Bend

Swinging easily around the curve above the clubhouse it would not have
been visible at first because of the deep shadows of the reflected
trees and mountains But presently as it drifted on into the broader
waters of The Bend it emerged from the shadows into the open moonlit
space and then to any one watching from the porch the dark object
drawing nearer and nearer in the bright moonlight would have soon
shaped itself into a boatan empty boat the watcher would have said
that had broken from its moorings somewhere up the riverand the
watcher would have heard through the still night air the dull heavy
roar of the mad waters at Elbow Rock

Drifting thus helpless in the grip of the main current the little
craft apparently was doomed to certain destruction Gently it would
float on the easy surface of the quiet moonlit Bend In front of the
house it would move faster and faster Where the river narrows it
would be caught as if by mighty hands hidden beneath the rushing flood
and dragged onward still faster and faster About it the racing waters
would leap and boil in their furious headlong career shaking and
tossing the helpless victim of their might with a vicious strength from
which there would be no escape until in the climax of the rivers
madness the object of its angry sport would be dashed against the
cliff and torn and crushed and hammered by the terrific weight of the
rushing flood against that rocky anvil into a battered and shapeless
wreck

The drifting boat drew nearer and nearer It reached the point where the
curve of the opposite bank draws in to form the narrow raceway of the
rapids It began to feel the stronger pull of those hidden hands
that had carried it so easily down The Bend And thenand thenthe
unguided helpless craft responded to the gentle pressure of some swirl
or crosscurrent in the main flow of the stream and swung a little
to one side A few feet farther and the new impulse became stronger
Yielding easily to the current that drew it so gently across the
invisible dividingline between safety and destruction the boat
swung in toward the shore A minute more and it had drifted into that
encircling curve of the bank where the current of the eddy carried it
around and around

The boat seemed undecided Would it hold to the harbor of safety into
which it had been drawn by the friendly current Would it swing out
again into the main stream and so to its own destruction

Three times the bow pointing out from the eddy crossed the
dangerline and for a moment hung on the very edge Three times the
invisible hands which held it drew it gently back to safety And so
finally the little craft so helpless so alone amid the many currents
of the great river came to rest against the narrow shelf of land at the
foot of the bank below Auntie Sues garden

The light in the window of Auntie Sues room went out The soft
moonlight flooded mountain and valley and stream The mad waters at
Elbow Rock roared in their wild fury Always alwaysirresistibly
inevitably unceasinglythe river poured its strength toward the sea



CHAPTER V

AUNTIE SUE RECOGNIZES A GENTLEMAN


Before the sun was high enough to look over Schoolhouse Hill the next
morning Judy went into the garden to dig some potatoes

Tom Wardens boys would come some day before long and dig them all
and put them away in the cellar for the winter But there was no need to
hurry the gathering of the full crop so the boys would come when it was
most convenient and in the meantime Judy would continue to dig from
day to day all that were needed for the kitchen in the little log house
by the river In spite of her poor crooked body the mountain girl was
strong and well used to hard work so the light task was for her no
hardship at all

As one will when first coming out of doors in the morning Judy paused
a moment to look about The sky so clear and bright the evening before
was now a luminous gray The mountains were lost in a ghostly world of
fog through which the river moved in stealthy silencea dull thing
of mystery with only here and there a touch of silvery light upon its
clouded surface The cottonwoods and willows on the opposite shore
were mere dreams of treesgray formless and weird The air was
filled with the dank earthsmell The heavy thundering roar of the
neverending war of the waters at Elbow Rock came louder and more
menacing but strangely unreal as if the mist itself were filled with
threatening sound

But to Judy the morning was only the beginning of another dayshe
looked but did not see To her the many everchanging moods of Nature
were without meaning With her basket in hand she went down to the
lower end of the garden where she had dug potatoes the time before and
where she had left the fork sticking upright in the ground

A few minutes served to fill the basket but before starting back to
the house the mountain girl paused again to look out over the river
Perhaps it was some vague memory of Auntie Sues talk the night
before that prompted her perhaps it was some instinct indefinite and
obscurewhatever it was that influenced her Judy left her basket and
went to the brink of the high bank above the eddy for a closer view of
the water

The next instant with the quick movement of an untamed creature of her
native mountain forests the girl sprang back and crouched close to
the ground to hide from something she had seen at the foot of the bank
Every movement of her twisted body expressed amazement and fear Her
eyes were wild and excited She looked carefully about as if for
dangers that might be hidden in the fog Once she opened her mouth as
if to call Halfrising she started as if to run to the house But
presently curiosity apparently overruled her fear and throwing
herself flat on the ground she wormed her way back to the brink of the
riverbank Cautiously without making a sound she peered through the
tall grass and weeds that fringed the rim above the eddy

The boat which some kindly impulse of the river had drawn so gently
aside from the stronger current that would have carried it down the
rapids to the certain destruction waiting at Elbow Rock still rested
with its bow grounded on the shore against which the eddying water had
pushed it But the thing that had so startled Judy was a man who was
lying apparently unconscious on the wet and muddy bottomboards of the
little craft

Breathlessly the girl looking down from the top of the bank watched
for some movement but the dirty huddled heap of wretched humanity
was so still that she could not guess whether it was living or dead
Fearfully she noted that there were no oars in the boat nor gun nor
fishingtackle of any sort The mans hat was missing His clothing was
muddy and disarranged His position was such that she could not see the
face

Drawing back Judy looked cautiously about then picking up a heavy
clod of dirt from the ploughed edge of the garden and crouching again
at the brink of the bank ready for instant flight she threw the
clod into the water near the boat The still form in the boat made no
movement following the splash Selecting a smaller clod the girl threw
the bit of dirt into the stern of the boat itself where it broke in
fragments And at this the figure moved slightly

Hits alive all right commented Judy to herself with a grin of
satisfaction at the result of her investigation But hits sure time
he was agittin up

Carefully selecting a still smaller bit of dirt she deliberately tossed
it at the figure itself Her aim was true and the clod struck the
man on the shoulder with the result that he stirred uneasily and
muttering something which Judy could not hear halfturned on his back
so that the girl saw the haggard unshaven face She saw too that in
one hand the man clutched an empty whisky bottle

At sight of the bottle the mountain girl rose to her feet with an
understanding laugh Hell she said aloud drunkthats alldead
drunk Ill sure fetch him out of hit And then grinning with
malicious delight she proceeded to pelt the man in the boat with
clods of dirt until he scrambled to a sitting posture and looked up in
bewildered confusion

If you please he said in a hoarse voice to the sallow oldyoung
face that grinned down at him from the top of the bank which one of
the Devils imps are you

As she looked into that upturned face Judys grin vanished I sure
lowed as how youall was dead she explained

Well returned the man in the boat wearily I can assure you that
its not in the least my fault if I disappoint you I feel as bad about
it as you do However I dont think I am so much alive that it makes
any material difference He lifted the whisky bottle and studied it
thoughtfully

Youall come dad burned near not bein ary bit alive returned the
girl

Yes said the man inquiringly

Yep you sure did come mighty nigh hit If your old Johnboat had
acarried youall on down ter Elbow Rock stead of bein ketched in
the eddy here youall would sure nough been atalkin to the Devil by
now

The man looking out over the river into the fog muttered to himself
I cant even make a success of dying it seems

Again he regarded the empty bottle in his hand with studied interest
Then tossing the bottle into the river he looked up once more to the
girl on the bank above

Listen sister he said nervously Is there any place around here
where I can buy a drink I need something rather badly Where am I
anyway

Youall are at Auntie Sues place said Judy an there sure aint no
chance for youall ter git ary licker here Whered youall come from
anyhow Howd youall git here thout no oars ner paddle ner nothin
Where was youall aimin ter go

Your questions my good girl are immaterial and irrelevant
returned the man in the boat The allimportant matter before us for
consideration ishow can I get a drink I MUST have a drink I tell
you He held up his hands and they were shaking as if with palsy And
I must have it damned quick

Youall sure do talk some powerful big words said Judy with critical
interest Youall sure must be some eddecated Auntie Sue now she
talks

The man interrupted her Who is Auntie Sue

I dont know Judy returned shes just Auntie Suethats all I
know She sure is

Again the man interrupted I think it would be well for me to
interview this worthy aunt of yours And then while he raised himself
unsteadily to his feet he continued in a muttering undertone You
dont seem to appreciate the situation If I dont get some sort of
liquor soon things are bound to happen

He attempted to step from the boat to the shore but the instability of
the light flatbottomed skiff together with his own unsteady weakness
combined to land him half in the water and half on the muddy bank where
he struggled helplessly and in his weakened condition would have
slipped wholly into the river had not Judy rushed down the rude steps to
his assistance

With a strength surprising in one of her apparent weakness the mountain
girl caught the stranger under his shoulders and literally dragged
him from the water When she had further helped him to his feet Judy
surveyed the wretched object of her beneficence with amused and curious
interest

The man with his unkempt hair unshaven haggard face bloodshot eyes
and slovenly dishevelled dress had appeared repulsive enough while in
the boat but now as he stood dripping with water and covered with
mud there was a touch of the ridiculous in his appearance that brought
a grin to the unlovely face of his rescuer and caused her to exclaim
with unnecessary frankness Ill be dad burned if youall aint a thing
ter look at mister

As the poor creature who was shaking as if with the ague regarded the
twisted form the wry neck and the sallow oldyoung face of the
girl who was laughing at him a gleam of sardonic humor flashed in
his bloodshot eyes Thanks he said huskily you are something of a
vision yourself arent you

The laughter went from Judys face as she caught the meaning of the
cruel words I aint never laid no claim ter bein a beauty she
retorted in her shrill drawling monotone But I kin tell youall one
thing mister Hit was GodAmighty Hisself an my drunken pap what made
me ter look like I do While youdamn youyouall just naturally
made yourself what you be

At the mountain girls illiterate words so pregnant with meaning a
remarkable change came over the face and manner of the man His voice
even for the moment lost its huskiness and vibrated with sincere
feeling as he steadied himself and bowing with courteous deference
said I beg your pardon miss That was unkind You really should have
left me to the river

Youall would adrownded sure if I had she retorted somewhat
mollified by the effect of her observation

Which he returned would have been so beautifully right and fitting
that it evidently could not be And with this cynical remark his
momentary bearing of selfrespect was gone

Are youall ameanin ter say that youall was awantin ter drown

Something like that he returned And then with a hint of ugliness in
his voice and eyes he rasped But look here girl do you think Im
going to stand like this all day indulging in idle conversation with
you Where is this aunt of yours Cant you see that Ive got to have a
drink

He started uncertainly toward the steps that led to the top of the bank
and Judy holding him by his arm helped him to climb the steep way A
part of the ascent he made on hands and knees Several times he would
have fallen except for the girls support But at last they gained the
top and stood in the garden

That there is the house said Judy pointing But I dont reckon as
how youall kin git ary licker there

The wretched man made no reply but with Judy still supporting him
stumbled forward across the rows of vegetables

The two had nearly reached the steps at the end of the porch when
Auntie Sue came from the house to see why Judy did not return with the
potatoes The dear old lady paused a moment startled at the presence of
the unprepossessing stranger in her garden Then with an exclamation of
pity she hurried to meet them

The man whose gaze as he shambled along was fixed on the ground did
not notice Auntie Sue until feeling Judy stop he also paused and
raising his head looked full at the beautiful old lady

Why Judy cried Auntie Sue her low sweet voice filled with gentle
concern What in the world has happened

With an expression of questioning bewilderment and rebuke on his haggard
face the man also turned to the mountain girl beside him

I found him in er Johnboat what done come ashore last night down
there in the eddy Judy explained to Auntie Sue To the man she said
This here is Auntie Sue mister but I dont reckon as how shes got
ary licker for you

Liquor questioned Auntie Sue What in the world do you mean
child Then quickly to the strangerMy dear man you are wringing
wet You must have been in the river Come come right in and let us do
something for you As she spoke she went toward him with outstretched
hands

But the wretched creature shrank back from her as if in fearhis
whole body shaking with emotion his fluttering hands raised in a
gesture of imploring protestwhile the eyes that looked up at the
saintly countenance of the old gentlewoman were the eyes of a soul
sunken in the deepest hell of shame and humiliation

Shocked with pitying horror Auntie Sue paused

The mans haggard unshaven face twitched and worked with the pain of
his suffering He bit his lips and fingered his quivering chin in a vain
effort at selfcontrol and then as he looked up at her the sunken
bloodshot eyes filled with tears that the tormented spirit had no power
to check

And Auntie Sue turned her face away

For a little they stood so Then as Auntie Sue faced him again the
stranger with a supreme effort of his will gained a momentary control
of his shattered nerves Drawing himself erect and standing steady and
tall before her he raised a hand to his uncovered head as if to remove
his hat When his hand found no hat to remove he smiled as if at some
jest at his own expense

I am so sorry madam he saidand his voice was musically clear and
cultured Please pardon me for disturbing you I did not know This
young woman should have explained You see when she spoke of Auntie
Sue I assumed of courseI meanI expected to find a native woman
who would He paused smiling again as if to assure her that he fully
appreciated the humor of his ridiculous predicament

But my dear sir cried Auntie Sue eagerly there is nothing to
pardon Please do come into the house and let us help you

But the stranger drew back shaking his head sadly You do not
understand madam It is not that my clothes are unpresentableit is
I myself who am unfit to stand in your presence much less to enter
your house I thank you but I must go

He was turning away when Auntie Sue reached his side and placed her
gentle old hand lightly on his arm

Please wont you come in sir I shall never forgive myself if I let
you go like this

The mans voice was hoarse and shaking now as he answered For Gods
sake madam dont touch me Let me go You must IIam not myself
You might not be safe with me Ask hershe knows He turned to Judy

Hes done said hit mam said Judy in answer to Auntie Sues
questioning look My pap he was that way when he done smashed me up
agin the wall when I was nothin but a baby an hit made me grow up
all crooked an ugly like what I be now

With one shamed glance at Auntie Sue the wretched fellow looked down
at the ground His head drooped forward His shoulders sagged His whole
body seemed to shrink Turning sadly away he again started back toward
the river

Stop Auntie Sues voice rang out imperiously

The man halted

Look at me she commanded

Slowly he raised his eyes The gentle old teacher spoke with fine
spirit now but kindly still This is sheer nonsense my boy You
wouldnt hurt me Why you couldnt Of course you are not yourself
but do you think that I do not know a gentleman when I meet one
Come She held out her hand

A moment he stood gazing at her in wondering awe Then his
farovertaxed strength failedhis abused nerves refused to bear
moreand he sanka pitiful cowering heap at her feet Hiding his
face in his shaking hands he sobbed like a child



CHAPTER VI

IN THE LOG HOUSE BY THE RIVER


Those two women managed somehow to get the almost helpless stranger
into the house where Auntie Sue after providing him with nightclothes
left by one of her guests by tactful entreaty and judicial commands
persuaded him to go to bed

Then followed several days and nights of weary watching There were
times when the man lay with closed eyes so weak and exhausted that he
seemed to be drifting out from these earthly shores on the deep waters
of that wide and unknown sea into which all the streams of life finally
flow But always Auntie Sue miraculously held him back There were
other times when by all the rules of the game he should have worn a
straitjacketwhen his delirium filled the room with all manner
of horrid creatures from the pit when leering devils and loathsome
serpents and gibbering apes tormented him until his unnatural strength
was the strength of a fiend and his tortured nerves shrieked in agony
But Auntie Sue perversely ignored the rules of the game And never did
the man even in his most terrible moments fail to recognize in the
midst of the hellish crew of his diseased imagination the silveryhaired
old teacher as the angel of his salvation Her gentle voice had always
power to soothe and calm him He obeyed her implicitly and like a
frightened child holding fast to her hand would beg piteously for her
to protect and save him

But no word of the mans lowmuttered broken sentences nor of his
wildest ravings ever gave Auntie Sue a clue to his identity She
searched his clothes but there was not a thing to give her even his
name

And yet that first day when Judy would have gone to neighbor Toms
for help Auntie Sue said No She even positively forbade the girl to
mention the strangers presence in the house should she chance to talk
with passing neighbors The river brought him to us Judy dear she
said We must save him No one shall know his shame to humiliate and
wound his pride and drag him down after he is himself again Until he
has recovered and is once more the man I believe him to be no one must
see him or know that he is here and no one must ever know how he came
to us

And late one evening when Judy was fast asleep and the man was lying
very still after a period of feverish tossing and muttering the dear
old gentlewoman crept quietly out of the house into the night She was
gone some time and when she returned again to the strangers bedside
she was breathless and trembling as from some unusual exertion And the
following afternoon when Judy came to her with the announcement that
the boat which had brought the man to them was no longer in the eddy
below the garden Auntie Sue said simply that she was glad it was
gone and cautioned the girl again that the strangers presence in the
house must not be made known to any one

When the mountain girl protested saying Youall aint got no call ter
be awearin yourself ter the bone atakin care of such as him Auntie
Sue answered Hush Judy How do you know what the poor boy really is

To which Judy retorted Hes just triflin an ornery an no count
thats what he is or he sure wouldnt been afloatin round in that
there old Johnboat thout ary gun or fishin lines or hat even ter
say nothin of that there whisky bottle bein plumb empty

Auntie Sue made no reply to the mountain girls harsh summingup of the
damning evidence against the stranger but left her and went softly to
the bedside of their guest

It was perhaps an hour later that Judy quietly entering the room
happened upon a scene that caused her to stand as if rooted to the spot
in openmouthed amazement

The man was sleeping and the silveryhaired old maidenlady seated
on the side of the bed was bending over the unconscious stranger and
gently stroking his tumbled redbrown hair even as a mother might
lovingly caress her sleeping child And then as Judy watched
breathless with wonder the proud old gentlewoman bending closer over
that still form on the bed touched her lipssoft as a rosepetalto
the strangers brow

When she arose and saw Judy standing there Auntie Sues delicate old
cheeks flushed with color and her eyes were shining With a gesture
she commanded the girl to silence and the two tiptoed from the room
When they were outside and Auntie Sue had cautiously closed the door
she faced the speechless Judy with a deliciously defiant air that could
not wholly hide her lovely confusion

IIwas thinking Judy how hehow hemight have beenmy son

Your son ejaculated the girl Why mam youall aint never even
been married as Ive ever hearn tell have you

Auntie Sue drew her thin shoulders proudly erect and lifting her fine
old face answered the challenging question with splendid spirit No I
have never been married but I might have been and if I had I suppose
I could have had a son couldnt I

The vanquished Judy retreated to the kitchen where in safety she sank
into a chair convulsed with laughter which she instinctively muffled
in her apron

Then came the day when the man weak and worn with his struggle looked
up at his gentle old nurse with the light of sanity in his deep
blue eyes Very tired eyes they were and filled with painful
memoriesfilled too with worshipping gratitude and wonder

She smiled down at him with delighted triumph and drawing a chair close
beside the bed seated herself and placed her soft hand on his where it
lay on the coverlid

You are much better this morning she said cheerily You will soon
be all right now And as she looked into the eyes that regarded hers
so questioningly there was in her face and manner no hint of doubt or
pretense or reproachonly confidence and love

He spoke slowly as if feeling for words I have been in Hell and
youyou have brought me out Why did you do it

Because you are mine she answered with her low chuckling laugh It
was so good to have him able to talk to her rationally after those long
hours of fighting

Because I am yours he repeated puzzling over her words

Yes she returned with a hint of determined proprietorship in her
voice because you belong to me You see that eddy where your boat
landed is my property and so anything that drifts down the river and
lodges there belongs to me Whatever the river brings to me is mine
The river brought you and so She finished with another laugha
laugh that was filled with tender motheryearning

The blue eyes smiled back at her for a moment then she saw them darken
with painful memories

Oh yes the river he said I wanted the river to do something for
me andand it did something quite different from what I wanted

Of course she returned eagerly the river is always like that It
always does the thing you dont expect it to do Just like life itself
Dont you see It begins somewhere away off at some little spring and
just keeps going and going and going and thousands and thousands of
other springs scattered all over the country start streams and creeks
and branches that run into it and make it bigger and bigger as it
winds and curves and twists along until it finally reaches the great
sea where its waters are united with all the waters from all the rivers
in all the world And in all of its many many miles from that first
tiny spring to the sea there are not two feet of it exactly alike
In all the centuries of its being there are never two hours alike An
infinite variety of days and nightsan infinite variety of skies and
light and clouds and daybreaks and sunsetsan infinite number and
variety of currents and shoals and deep places and quiet spots and
dangerous rapids and eddiesand along its banks an endless change
of hills and mountains and flats and forests and meadows and farms and
citiesand She paused breathless And then when he did not speak
but only watched her she continued Dont you see Of course the
river never could be what you expect any more than life could be
exactly what you want and dream it will be

Who in the world are you he asked wonderingly And what in the
world are you doing here in the backwoods

Smiling at his puzzled expression she answered I am Auntie Sue I am
LIVING here in the backwoods

But your real name Wont you tell me your name I must know how to
address you

Oh my name is Susan E WakefieldMISS Wakefield if you please I
shall be seventyone years old the eighteenth day of next November And
you must call me Auntie Suejust as every one else does

WakefieldWakefieldwhere have I seen that name He wrinkled his
brow in an effort to remember WakefieldI feel sure that I have heard
it somewhere

It is not unlikely she returned lightly It is not at all an
uncommon name And now that I am properly introduced dont you
think

He hesitated a moment then said deliberately My name is Brian Kent

That is an Irish name she said quickly and that is why your hair is
so nearly red and your eyes so blue

Yes he returned from my mother And please dont ask me more now
for I cant lie to you and I wont tell you the truth And she saw
again the dark shadows of painful memories come into the blue eyes

Bending over the bed she laid her soft hand on his brow and pushed
back his heavy hair and her sweet old voice was very low and gentle as
she said My dear boy I shall never ask you more The river brought
you to me and you are mine You must not even think of anything else
just now When you are stronger and are ready we will talk of your
future but of your past you

A loud knock sounded at the door of the living room

There is someone at the door she said hastily I must go Lie still
and go to sleep like a good boy wont you

Swiftly she leaned over and before he realized he felt her lips
touch his forehead Then she was gone and Brian Kents Irish eyes were
filled with tears Turning to the wall he hid his face in the pillow



CHAPTER VII

OFFICERS OF THE LAW


As Auntie Sue was closing the door of her guests room carefully behind
her Judy came from the kitchen in great excitement and the knocking at
the front door of the house was repeated

Hits the Sheriff mam whispered Judy I was just acomin ter tell
you I seed em from the kitchenwinder Hes got two other men with
him Their hosses is tied ter the fence in front What in hell will we
do now They are after him in there sure s death

Auntie Sues face was white and her lips trembledbut only for a
moment

Go back into the kitchen Judy and stay there she commanded in a
whisper and went to open the front door as calmly as if nothing unusual
had happened

Sheriff Knox was a big man with a bluff kindly manner and a voice
that made nothing of closed doors He returned Auntie Sues greeting
heartily and with one of his companionsa quiet businesslooking
gentlemanaccepted her cordial invitation to come in The third man of
the party remained near the saddlehorses at the gate

Well Auntie Sue said the Sheriff settling his ponderous bulk in one
of the old ladys rockingchairs which certainly was not built to carry
such a weight how are you I havent seen you in a coons age Ill
swear though you aint a minute older than you was when you first
begun teachin the little Elbow Rock school up there on the hill are
you

I dont know Sheriff Auntie Sue returned with a nervous little
laugh I sometimes think that I am a few days older I have watched a
good many sunsets since then you know

The big officers laughter almost shook the log walls of the house To
his quiet companion who had taken a chair near the window he said
Ill have to tell you Ross that Auntie Sue owns every sunset in these
Ozark Mountains What was it you paid for them He turned again to
their smiling hostess Oh yes fifty cents an acre for the land and
fourteen dollars and a half for the sunsets Youll have to be blamed
careful not to trespass on the sunsets in this neighborhood Ross
Again his hearty laugh roared out while his chair threatened to
collapse with the quaking of his massive body

The gentleman seated at the window laughed quietly in sympathy

Youll be all right though Ross the Sheriff continued as long
as youre with me Auntie Sue and me have been friends for about twenty
year now I always stop to see her whenever Im passing through the
Elbow Rock neighborhood if I aint in too big a hurry Stayed with her
a week once five years ago when we was after that Lewis gang
She knows Id jail any man on earth that would even touch one of her
sunsets

Then as if the jesting allusion to his office reminded him of his
professional duties he added I plumb forgot Auntie Sue this
gentleman is Mr Ross He is one of William J Burnss crack detectives
Dont be scared though he aint after you

Auntie Sue while joining in the laughter and acknowledging the
introduction regarded the businesslooking gentleman by the window with
intense interest

I think she said slowlyand the sweetness of her low cultured
voice was very marked in contrast to the Sheriffs thundering tonesI
think sir that this is the first time in my life that I ever saw a
real detective I have read about them of course

Mr Ross was captivated by the charm of this beautiful old gentlewoman
who regarded him with such childlike interest and who spoke with such
sweet frankness and dignity Smilingly he returned

I fear madam that you would find me very disappointing No one that I
ever knew in my profession could hope to live up to the reputation
given us by the storybooks No secret service man living can remotely
approximate the deeds performed by the detectives of fiction We are
very very human I can assure you

I am sure that you at least must be very kind returned Auntie
Sue gently And the cheeks of the experienced officer flushed like the
cheeks of a schoolboy

Mr Ross Auntie Sue said the Sheriff is as I was telling you one
of William J Burnss big men

Auntie Sue gave her attention to her big friend Yes

The Sheriff continued Now the Burns people you see protect the
banks all over the country

Yes came again in a tone so low and gentle that the monosyllable
was scarcely heard

The officers loud voice went on And Mr Ross here works most of
his time on these bank cases Just now he is trailing a fellow that got
away with a lot of money from the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank of
Chicago about a month agothat is the man disappeared about a month
ago He had been stealing along from the bank for about a yearworked
for them you see

The Empire Consolidated Savings Bank Auntie Sue spoke the words in
a voice that was little more than a whisper It was to the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank that she had sent the money which she had
received from her brother in Buenos Aires and Homer T Ward the
president of that bank was one of her old pupils Why her stranger
guest in the other room there was that very moment wearing one of the
bank presidents nightshirts

And do youAuntie Sue addressed the detectivedo you know the mans
name Mr Ross

Oh yes returned the officer his name is Brian Kent

Some source of strength deephidden in her gentle nature enabled
Auntie Sue to control her emotions though her voice broke a little as
she slowly repeated the mans name Brian Kent And do I understand
sir that you have traced the man to thisneighborhood

The detective was too skilled not to notice Auntie Sues manner and the
break in her voice but he never dreamed that this old gentlewomans
agitation was caused by a deeper interest than a quite natural fear that
a dangerous criminal might be lurking in the immediate vicinity

Not exactly Mrsah

Miss Wakefieldshe supplied her name with a smile

With a courteous bow the detective continued We do not know for sure
that the man is in this neighborhood Miss Wakefield There is really no
cause for you to be alarmed Even if he should call at your house here
you need not be frightened for I assure you the man is not at all a
dangerous character

I am glad said Auntie Sue and she laughed a little with a relief
more genuine than her callers knew

Detective Ross continued as if anxious to finish his unpleasant duty
It is too bad for us to be disturbing you with this business Miss
Wakefield and I hope you will forgive us but the case is like this
We traced our man to the little town of Borden some forty miles up the
river from here He disappeared from the hotel one night leaving his
suitcase and apparently everything he had with him and not a
soul that we can find has seen him since Of course everybody says
suicide He had been drinking heavily and acting rather queer the two
or three days he was at the hotelit seems But I am not willing yet
to accept the suicide idea as final because it would be too easy for
him to give things that appearance in order to throw us off and I cant
get away from the fact that a Johnboat that was tied to the bank near
the hotel managed to break loose and drift off down the river that same
night Working on my theory we are following down the river trying
to get trace of either the boat or the man So far we havent heard of
either which rather strengthens me in my belief that the boat and the
man went away together He is probably traveling nights and lying up
under the willows in daylight But he will be compelled to show himself
somewhere soon in order to get something to eat for he couldnt have
taken much with him trying as he was to create the impression that he
had committed suicide You have a wonderful view of the river here Miss
Wakefield

Yes sir it is beautiful from the porch

You spend a good deal of time on the porch do you

Yes sir

And you would be quite likely to notice any boat passing wouldnt
you

Yes sir

Could you see a boat at nightin the moonlight I mean

I could if it were well out in the middle of the stream away from the
shadow of the trees along the bank

Have you seen any boats pass lately Miss Wakefield

No sir I havent seen a boat on the river for a month at least

Dead certain about it are you Auntie Sue asked the Sheriff

Yes sir I am very sure she returned Judy and I were talking about
it yesterday

Who is Judy asked the detective

The Sheriff answered Just a girl that lives with Auntie Sue

And Auntie Sue added I know Judy has seen no boats passing because
as I say we were talking about it

I see said the detective And may I ask Miss Wakefield if any
oneany stranger I meanhas called at the house lately or if you
have seen any one in the vicinity

The gentle old lady hesitated

The officers thought she was searching her memory to be sure before she
answered

Then Auntie Sue said deliberately No sir we have not seen a
stranger in this vicinity for several weeks The last one was a
mulebuyer who stopped to ask if he was on the right road to Tom
Wardens and that must have been fully six weeks ago

The detective looked at Sheriff Knox

Well said the big officer I reckon we might as well push along

The two men arose

Oh but surely you will stay for dinner said Auntie Sue while her
dear heart was faint with fear lest they accept and thus bring about
who could say what disastrous consequences through their meeting with
Judy

Not this time Auntie Sue returned the Sheriff Mr Ross is anxious
to get on down the river as fast as he can Hes got men on watch at
Whites Crossing and if our man aint passed there or if we dont
strike his trail somewhere before we get there we will jump back on the
railroad and get some boy to bring the horses through later

I see returned Auntie Sue And to the detective she added smiling
I am sure it must be very difficult for any one to escape you Mr
Ross I have read such wonderful things about Mr Burns and the work
of his organization and now that I have met youa real live
detectiveI shall be very careful indeed about what I do in the
future I shouldnt want to have you on my track I assure you

The two men laughed heartily and the detective as he extended his hand
in farewell returned I count it a great privilege to have met you
Miss Wakefield and if you will promise to do one thing for me Ill
agree to be very lenient with you if I am ever assigned to a case in
which you are to be brought to justice

I promise returned the old lady quickly I really wouldnt dare to
refuse under the circumstances would I What do you want me to do Mr
Ross

If this man Brian Kent should happen to appear in this vicinity will
you get a message as quickly as possible at any cost to Sheriff Knox

Why of course agreed Auntie Sue But you have not yet told me what
the man looks like Mr Ross

He is really a fine looking chap the detective answered Thirty
years oldfully six feet tallrather slender but well builtweighs
about one hundred fiftya splendid headsmooth shavenreddish
hairdark blue eyesand a high broad forehead He is of
Irish extractionis culturedvery courteous in his manner and
speechdresses welland knows a lot about books and authors and such
things

I would surely know him from that description said Auntie Sue
thinking of the wretched creature who had fallen sobbing at her feet
so short a time before But you do not make him seem like a criminal
at all It is strange that a man such as you describe should be a
fugitive from the law is it not

We come in contact with many strange things in our business Miss
Wakefield the Burns operative answereda little sadly Auntie Sue
thought Life itself is so strange and complex though you in your
quiet retreat here can scarcely find it so

Indeed I find life very wonderful Mr Ross even here in my little
house by the river she answered slowly

Sheriff Knox held out a newspaper to Auntie Sue Just happened to
remember that I had it in my pocket he said It gives a pretty full
account of this fellow Kents case You will notice there is a big
reward offered for his capture If you can catch him for us youll make
enough money to keep you mighty nigh all the rest of your life And
the officers great laugh boomed out at the thought of the old
schoolteacher as a thiefcatcher

By the way Sheriff said Auntie Sue as they were finally saying
goodbye at the door you didnt happen to ask at Thompsonville for my
mail did you as you came through Her voice was trembling now with
eagerness and anxiety

Im plumb sorry Auntie Sue but I didnt You see we were so busy
on this job I clean forgot about stopping here and besides we might
have caught our man before we got this far you see

Of course returned Auntie Sue I should have thought of that but
I have been rather anxious about an important letter that seems to have
been delayed Some of the neighbors will probably be going to the office
today though Goodbye You know you are always welcome Sheriff and
you too Mr Ross if you should ever happen to be in this part of the
country again

A wonderful old woman Ross commented Sheriff Knox as they were
riding away And the quiet businesslooking detective whose life
had been spent in combating crime and deception answered as he waved
farewell to Auntie Sue who watched them from the door of the little log
house by the river A very wonderful woman indeedthe loveliest old
lady I have ever metand the most remarkable



CHAPTER VIII

THAT WHICH IS GREATER THAN THE LAW


When she had watched Sheriff Knox and his two companions ride out of
sight Auntie Sue turned slowly back into the house to face Judy who
stood accusingly in the kitchen doorway

For what seemed a long time the old gentlewoman and the deformed
mountain girl stood silently looking at each other Then Auntie Sue
nervously crossed the room to lay the newspaper which the Sheriff had
given her on the table beside her basket of sewing

Without speaking Judy followed her watching every movement intently

Turning to face her companion again Auntie Sue stood still speechless
clasping and unclasping her thin old hands

Judy spoke in her shrill drawling monotone Youall have sure fixed
hit this here time haint you Cant youall see what a hell of a hole
youve done got us inter

When Auntie Sue apparently could not reply Judy continued Just as if
hit wasnt more n enough for youall ter go an wear yourself plumb out
atakin keer of that there ornery nocount feller what I never ought
ter dragged out of the river nohow An now youall got ter go
an just naturally lie like you did ter the Sheriff an that there
deteckertive man I was plumb scared to death alistenin ter you
through the crack in the kitchen door I lowed every minute theyd
ketch you sure My LordAmighty mam cant youall figger whatll
happen ter weuns if they ever finds out that weuns done had him hid
right here in this here house all the time I never heard tell of such
dad burned fool doins in all my born days I sure wish ter God that
there old Johnboat had atuck him off down the river an smashed him
up agin Elbow Rock like hit ort an not afetched him ter our door ter
git weuns in jail for savin his worthless nocount hideI sure do

But Judy I never in all my life did such a thing before said Auntie
Sue in a tremulous whisper too overwrought to speak aloud

Youall aint aneedin ter do hit but onct neither Onct is sure a
heap plenty for that there big Sheriff man Just look what he did ter
my pap Hes jailed pap seven times that I kin reclect GodAmighty
knows how many times he ketched him fore I was borned An pap he
didnt do so mighty much ary time neither

I just had to do it Judy dear protested Auntie Sue It seemed as
if I simply could not tell the truth something wouldnt let me

Judy unheeding her companions agitation continued reviewing the
situation An just look at all the money youall done lost

Money questioned Auntie Sue

Yep moneythat there reward what theyd apaid youall if youall
hadnt alied like you did I reckon as how thered abeen as much
maybe as what was in that there letter youall done sent ter the bank
an aint never heard tell of since Hits most likely clean gone by
now an here you done gone an throwd this other awayplumb throwd
hit away

At this Auntie Sues spirit suddenly flashed into fiery indignation

Judith Taylor she said sharply how can you suggest such a wicked
thing Why I wouldI wouldDIE before I would accept a penny for
doing such a thing

And it was Judy now who stood silent and abashed before the aroused
Auntie Sue

Dont ever speak of such a thing again continued the old lady
And remember we must be more careful than ever now not to let any
onenot a soulknow that MrMrBurns is in the house or that we
ever saw him

That there deteckertive man said as how the fellers name was Brian
Kent didnt be muttered the sullen Judy

I dont care what the detective man said retorted Auntie Sue I am
telling you that his name is Brian Burns and you had better remember
it You had better remember too that if anybody ever finds out the
truth about him you and I will go right along to jail with him

Yes mam I sure aint aimin ter forgit that replied the humbled
Judy and she slouched away to the kitchen

Auntie Sue went to the door of Brian Kents room But with her
hand outstretched toward the latch she hesitated Had he heard The
Sheriffs voice had been so loud She feared to enter yet she knew that
she must At last she knocked timidly and when there was no answer
knocked again louder Cautiously she opened the door

The man lay with his face to the wallto all appearances fast asleep

She tiptoed to the bed and stood looking down upon the stranger
for whom without a shadow of reasonone would have saidshe had
violated one of the most deeply rooted principles of her seventy years

To Auntie Sue daughter of New England Puritanism and religious to
the deeps of her being a lie was abhorrentand she had
lieddeliberately carefully and with painstaking skill she had lied
She had not merely evaded the truth she had liedand that to save a
man of whom she knew nothing except that he was a fugitive from the law
And the strangest thing about it was this that she was glad She could
not feel one twinge of regret for her sin She could not even feel that
she had indeed sinned She had even a feeling of pride and triumph
that she had lied so successfully She was troubled though about this
new and wholly unexpected development in her life It had been so easy
for her She had lied so naturally so instinctively

She remembered how she had spoken to Brian Kent of the river and of
life She saw now that the river symbolized not only life as a whole
with its many everchanging conditions and currents amid which the
individual must livethe river symbolized as truly the individual
life with its everchanging moods and motivesits evervarying and
oftenconflicting currents of instinct and trainingits infinite
variety of intellectual deeps and shallowsits gentle places of
spiritual calmand its wild and turbulent rapids of dangerous passion

What hitherto unsuspected currents in her liferiver she asked
herself had carried her so easily into falsehood What strange forces
were these she wondered that had set her so suddenly against honesty
and truthfulness and law and justice And this strangerthis wretched
haggardfaced drunken creature who had been brought by the mysterious
currents of life to her doorwhat was there in him that so compelled
her protecting interest What was it within him deeply hidden under
the repellent exterior of his being that had so awakened in her that
strange feeling of possessionof motherhood

It was not strange that in her mental and spiritual extremity the dear
old gentlewomans lifelong habit should lead her to kneel beside
the strangers bed and pray for understanding and guidance It was
significant that she did not ask her God to forgive the lie

And presently as she prayed she felt the man on the bed move Then
a hand lightly touched her hair She remained very still for a
littleher head still bowed The hand that touched so reverently the
silvery gray hair trembled a little Slowly the old teacher raised her
face to look at him and the Irish blue eyes of Brian Kent were wide
with wondering awe and glowing with a light that warmed her heart and
strengthened her

Why did you do it he asked You wonderful wonderful woman Why did
you do it

Slowly she rose from her knees to sit beside him on the bed You
heard

He nodded his head not trusting himself to speak

I was afraid the Sheriff talked too loud she said

But why did you do it he persisted

I think it was because I couldnt do anything else she answered with
her little chuckling laugh Then she added seriously How could I let
them take you away Are you not mine Did not the river bring you to
me

I must tell you he answered sadly that what the detective told you
about me is true

Yes she answered smiling

I was a clerk in the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank he continued
and I stole moneyfor nearly a year I stolenot large sums but a
little at a time Then when I knew that it was going to be discovered
I took quite a lot and ran away

Yes said Auntie Sue

Do you not care that I am a thief he questioned wonderingly

Oh yes I care very much she returned But you see after all
your stealing is a little thing that can be made all right Your being
a thief is so small in comparison with other things which you might have
been but which you are not and of so little importance in comparison
with what you really ARE that I cant feel so very bad about it

Butbutmy drinkingmy condition when He could not go on

Why you see she answered I cant think of THAT man as being YOU at
all THAT was something that the accident of your being a thief did to
youlike catching cold and being sick after accidentally falling in
the river

After a little silence the man spoke slowly I suppose every thief
when he is caught says the same thing but I really never wanted to do
it Circumstances he paused biting his lip and turning away

What was she like asked Auntie Sue gently

She and his face reddened

Yes I have observed that to a man circumstances nearly always mean
a woman To a woman of course it is a man

I cannot tell you about her now he said Some day perhaps when I
am further away from it But she is not at all like you

And this answer for some strange reason brought a flush of pleasure to
the face of the old schoolteacher

I did not mean for you to tell me now she returned I only wanted
you to know that even though I am an old maid I can understand

She left him then and went to attend to her simple household duties

It was not until quite late in the evening that Auntie Sue took up the
newspaper which Sheriff Knox had given her Judy had retired to her
room and Brian Burnsas they had agreed he should be calledwas fast
asleep

Tomorrow Brian was going to sit up His clothing had been washed and
ironed and pressed and Auntie Sue was making some little repairs in the
way of darning and buttons She had finished and was putting her needle
and scissors in the sewingbasket on the table beside her when she
noticed the paper which she had forgotten

The article headed BANK CLERK DISAPPEARS was not long It told in a
matteroffact newspaper way how Brian Kent had at different times
covering a period of several months taken various sums from the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank and gave so far as was then known the
accumulated amount which he had taken The dishonest clerk had employed
several methods in his operations but the particular incidentread
Auntie Suewhich had led to the exposure of Kents stealings was the
theft of a small sum of money in banknotes which had been sent to the
bank in a letter by one of the banks smaller depositors

The newspaper fell from Auntie Sues hand Mechanically she fingered
the garment lying in her lap

She too had sent a sum of money in a letter for deposit to her small
account in this bank from which Brian Kent had stolen She would not
have sent the familiar paper currency of the United States that way
but this money was in Argentine notes Her brother from faraway Buenos
Aires had sent it to her saying that it would help to keep her during
the closing years of her life and she had added it to her small savings
with a feeling of deepest gratitude that her last days were now fully
provided for And she had received from the bank no acknowledgment of
her letter with its enclosures

Taking up the paper with hands that trembled so she scarce could
distinguish the words she read the paragraph again

Suddenly she recalled the mans puzzled expression when she had
told him her name and she seemed to hear him say again Wakefield
Wakefield Where have I seen that name

She looked at the date of the paper Beyond all doubt the man sleeping
there in the other roomthe man whom she had saved from a suicides
end in the riverwhom she had nursed through the hell of delirium
tremenswhom she had yearned over as over her own son and for whom
to save from the just penalty of his crime she had liedbeyond all
doubt that man had robbed her of the money that was to have insured to
her peace and comfort in the closing years of her life

Carefully Auntie Sue laid the garment she had just mended with such
loving care with the rest of Brian Kents clothing on the nearby
chair Rising she went with slow troubled step to the porch

There was no moon that night to turn the waters of The Bend into a
stream of silvery light But the stars were shining bright and clear
and she could see the river where it made its dark mysterious way
between the walls of shadowy hills and borne to her ears on the gentle
night wind came the deep thundering roar of the angry waters at Elbow
Rock

For a long time she stood there on the porch looking into the night
with the light from the open door of her little house behind her and
she felt very lonely very tired and very old With her beautiful old
face upturned to the infinite sky where shining worlds are scattered
in such lavish profusion she listened listened to the river that with
its countless and complex currents swept so irresistibly onward along
the way that was set for it by Him who swung those starworlds in the
limitless space of that mighty arch above And something of the spirit
that broods ever over the river must have entered into the soul of
Auntie Sue When she turned back into the house there was a smile on
her face though her eyes were wet with tears

Going to the chair that held Brian Kents clothing she took the
garments in her arms and pressed them to her lips Then she carried them
to his room

For some time she remained in that darkened chamber beside the sleeping
man

When she returned to the livingroom she again took up the newspaper
Very carefully that her sleeping companions in the house might not hear
her she went to the kitchen the paper in her hand Very carefully
that no sound should betray her act she burned the paper in the kitchen
stove



CHAPTER IX

AUNTIE SUES PROPOSITION


During the next few days Brian Kent rapidly regained his strength No
one seeing the tall selfpossessed gentleman who sat with Auntie Sue on
the porch overlooking the river or strolled about the place could have
imagined him the wretchedly repulsive creature that Judy had dragged
from the eddy so short a time before And no oneexempting perhaps
detective Rosswould have identified this bearded guest of Auntie
Sues as the absconding bank clerk for whose arrest a substantial reward
was offered

But Mr Ross had departed from the Ozarks to report to the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank that to the best of his knowledge and belief
Brian Kent had been drowned Homer T Ward himself wrote Auntie Sue
about the case for the detective had told the bank president about his
visit to the little log house by the river and the banker knew that his
old teacher would wish to hear the conclusion of the affair

The facts upon which the detective based his conclusion that Brian Kent
was dead were first of all the mans general character temperament
habits and ambitionsaside from his thefts from the bankprior to
the time of his exposure and flight and his known mental and physical
condition at the time he disappeared from the hotel in the little river
town of Borden

The detective reasoned and there are thousands of cases that could
be cited to support his contention that by such a man as Brian
Kentknowing as he must have known the comparative certainty of
his ultimate arrest and conviction and being in a mental and nervous
condition bordering on insanity as a result of his constant brooding
over his crime and the excessive drinking to which he had resorted for
reliefby such a man death would almost inevitably be chosen rather
than a life of humiliation and disgrace and imprisonment

Acting upon the supposition however that the man had gone down the
river in that missing boat and that the appearance of suicide
was planned by the fugitive to trick his pursuers the detectives
ascertained that he had provided no supplies for a trip down the river
The man would be compelled to seek food The mountain country through
which he must pass was sparsely settled and for a distance that would
have taken a boat many days to cover the officers visited every house
and cabin and camp on either side of the river without finding a trace
of the hunted man The river had been watched night and day The net set
by the Burns operatives touched every settlement and village for many
miles around And finally the battered and broken wreck of the lost
boat had been found some two miles below Elbow Rock

   And so my dear Auntie Sue Banker Ward wrote in conclusion
you may rest in peace secure in the certainty that my thieving bank
clerk is not lurking anywhere in your beautiful Ozarks to pounce down
upon you unawares in your little house beside the river The man is
safely dead There is no doubt about it I regret more than I can
express that you have been in any way disturbed by the affair Please
think no more about it

By the way you made a great impression upon detective Ross He was
more than enthusiastic over your graciousness and your beauty I
never heard him talk so much before in all the years I have known him
Needless to say I indorsed everything he said about the dearest
old lady in the world and then we celebrated by dining together and
drinking a toast to Auntie Sue   

Auntie Sue went with the letter to Brian and acquainted him with that
part of the bankers communication which related to the absconding
clerk but about her relation to the president of the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank she said nothing

Isnt it splendid she finished her face glowing with delight

Splendid he echoed looking at her with grave questioning eyes

Why yes of course she returned Arent you glad to be so dead
under the circumstances Think what it means You are free now No
horrid old detectives dogging your steps or waiting behind every bush
and tree to pounce upon you There is nothing now to prevent your
being the kind of man that you always meant to beand really ARE
tooexcept for youryour accidental tumble in the river she
finished with her low chuckling laugh And some day she went on
with conviction when you have established yourselfwhen you have
asserted your REAL self I meanand have paid back every penny of the
money Homer T Ward and Mr Ross and everybody will be glad that they
didnt catch you before you had a chance to save yourself

And you Auntie Sue Brians voice was deep with feeling And you

Me Oh I am as glad now as I can ever be because you see to me it
is already done

For a long minute he looked at her without speaking then turned his
face away to gaze out over the river and the hills but his eyes were
the eyes of one who looks without seeing

Slowly he said I wish I could be sure There was a time when I
waswhen I believed in myself It seems to me now that it was years
and years ago I thought then that nothing could shake me in my
purpose that nothing could check me in my ambition I saw myself going
straight on to the goal I had set for myself as certainly aswell as
your river ever there goes on to the sea But now He shook his head
sadly

Auntie Sue laughed You foolish boy My river out there doesnt go
straight at all It meets all sorts of obstacles and is beset by all
sorts of conflicting influences and so is forced to wind and twist and
work its way along but the big splendid thing about the river is that
it keeps going on It never stops to turn back No matter what happens
to it it never stops It goes on and on and on unto the very end until
it finally loses itself in the triumph of its own achievementthe
sea

And you think that I can go on he asked doubtingly

I know you can go on she answered with conviction

But why are you so sure

Perhaps she returned smiling seventy years makes one sure of some
things

Ho exclaimed passionately But you do not knowyou cannot knowhow
my life my dreams my plans my hopes myeverythinghas been broken
into bits

She answered calmly pointing to Elbow Rock Look there Brian See
how the river is broken into bits See how its smoothly flowing onward
sweep is suddenly changed to wild chaotic turmoil how it rages and
fumes and frets and smashes itself against the rocks But it goes on
just the same Life cannot be always calm and smoothly flowing like the
peaceful Bend But life can always go on Life must always go on And
you will find my dear boy that a little way below Elbow Rock there is
another quiet stretch

When he spoke again there was a note of almost reverence in his voice

Auntie Sue was there ever a break in your life Were your dreams and
plans ever smashed into bits

For a little she did not answer then she said bravely Yes Brian
several times Onceyears and years agoI do not know how I managed
to go on I felt then as you feel now but somehow I managed and
so found the calm places The last hard spot came quite recently
She paused wondering what he would do if she were to tell him how he
himself had made the hard spot But now she continued I am hoping
that the rest of the way will be calm and untroubled

I wish I could help to make it so he cried impulsively

Why you can she returned quickly Of course you can Perhaps that
is why the current landed your boat at my garden instead of carrying
you on down the rapids to Elbow Rock Who can say

A new light kindled in the mans eyes as his sensitive nature took fire
at Auntie Sues words I could do anything for a woman like you Auntie
Sue he said quietly but with a conviction that left no room for
doubt But you must tell me what I am to do

She answered You are simply to go on with your lifejust as if no
Elbow Rock had ever disturbed you just as the river goes onto the
end

She left him then to think out his problem alone for the teacher of
so many years experience was too wise not to know when a lesson was
finished

But when the end of the day was come they again sat together on the
porch and watched the miracle of the sunset hour And no word was spoken
by them now of life and its problems and its meanings As one listens
to the song of a bird without thought of musical notes or terms as one
senses the fragrance of a flower without thought of the chemistry of
perfume as one feels the presence of spring in the air without thought
of the day of the week so they were conscious of the beauty the glory
and the peace of the evening

Only when the soft darkness of the night lay over the land and river
and mountain and starry sky were veiled in dreamy mystery did Auntie
Sue speak Oh it is so good to have some one to share it withsome
one who understands I am very lonely sometimes Brian I wonder if you
know

Yes Auntie Sue I know for I have been lonely too

And so the old gentlewoman whose lifework was so nearly finished and
the man in the flush of his manhood years whose life had been so nearly
wrecked were drawn very close by a something that came to them out of
the beauty and the mystery of that hour

The next day Brian told Auntie Sue that he would leave on the morrow

Leave she echoed in dismay Why Brian where are you going

I dont exactly know he returned but of course I must go
somewhere out into the world again

And why must you go somewhere out into the world again she
demanded

To work he answered smiling If I am to go on as you say I must
go where I can find something to do

If that isnt just like youyou child cried the old teacher You
are all alikeyou boys and girls You all must have something to do
always it is something to do

Well he returned and must we not have something to do

You will do something certainly she answered but before you
can DO anything that is worth doing you must BE something Life isnt
DOINGit is BEING

I wonder if that was not the real reason for my wretched failures
said Brian thoughtfully

It is the real reason for most of our failures she returned And so
you are not going to fail again You are not going away somewhere you
dont know where to do something you dont know what You are going to
stay right here and just BE something Then when the time comes you
will do whatever is yours to do as naturally and as inevitably as the
birds sing as the blossoms come in the spring or as the river finds
its way to the sea

And more than ever Brian Kent felt in the presence of Auntie Sue as
a little boy to whom the world had grown suddenly very big and very
wonderful

But after a while he shook his head smiling wistfully No no
Auntie Sue that sounds all true and right enough but it cant be I
must go just the same

Why cant it be Brian

For one thing he returned I cannot risk the danger to you After
all as long as I am living there is a chance that my identity will be
discovered and youno no I must not

As for that she answered quickly the chances of your being
identified are a thousand times greater if you go into the world again
too soon Some day of course you must go but you are safer now right
here Andshe added quicklyit would be no easier for me dear boy
totohave it happen somewhere away from me You are mine you know
no matter where you go

But Auntie Sue he protested I am not a gentleman of means that I
can do nothing indefinitely neither am I capable of living upon your
hospitality for an extended period I must earn my bread and butter

The final sentence came with such a lifting of his head such a look
of stern decision and such an air of pride that the gentle old
schoolteacher laughed until her eyes were filled with tears and Judy
at the crack in the kitchen door wondered if the mistress of the little
log house by the river were losing her mind

Oh Brian Brian cried Auntie Sue wiping her eyes I knew you
would come to the bread and butter at last That is where all our
philosophies and reasonings and arguments come at last dont they Just
bread and butter that is all And I love you for it Of course you
cant live upon my hospitalityand I couldnt let you if you would
And if you WOULD I wouldnt let you if I could I am no more a lady of
means my haughty sir than you are a gentleman of independent fortune
The fact is Brian dear I suspect that you and I are about the two
poorest people in the worldto be anything like as pretentiously
respectable and properly proud as we are

When the man could make no reply but only looked at her with a
muchpuzzled and stillproud expression she continued halflaughingly
but well pleased with him Please Brian dont look so haughtily
injured I had no intention of insulting you by offering charity Far
from it

Instantly the mans face changed He put out his hands protestingly
and his blue eyes filled as he said impulsively Auntie Sue after
what you have done for me I

She answered quickly We are considering the future What has been is
past Our river is already far beyond that point in its journey Dont
let us try to turn the waters back I promise you I am going to be very
very practical and make you pay for EVERYTHING

Smiling now he waited for her to explain

I must tell you first she began that except for a very small
amount in thein a savings bank I have nothing to provide for my last
days except this little farm

What a shame Brian Kent exclaimed that a woman like you can give
her life to the public schools for barely enough salary to keep her
alive during her active years and then left in her old age with no
means of support It is a national disgrace

Auntie Sue chuckled with appreciation of the rather grim humor of the
situation What would Brian Kent indignant at the public neglect of the
schoolteacher say of the man who had robbed her of the money that was
to provide for her closing years After all most public sins are only
individual sins at the last she said musingly

I beg your pardon said Brian not in the least seeing the relevancy
of her words

Auntie Sue came quickly back to her subject Only thirty acres of my
little farm is under cultivation The remaining fifty acres is wild
timberland If I could have that fifty acres also in cultivation with
the money that the timber would bringwhich would not be a great
dealI would be fairly safe for thefor the rest of my evening she
finished with a smile Do you see

You mean that Ithat you want me to stay here and work for you

I mean she answered that if you choose to stay for awhile you
need not feel that you would be accepting my hospitality as charity
she returned gently I am not exactly offering you a job I am only
showing you how you could without sacrificing your pride remain in
this quiet retreat for awhile before returning to the world

It would be heaven Auntie Sue he returned earnestly I want to stay
so bad that I fear myself Let me think it over until tomorrow Let me
be sure that I am doing the right thing and not merely the thing I want
to do

She liked his answer and did not mention the subject again until Brian
himself was ready And strangely enough it was poor twisted Judy who
helped him to set matters straight



CHAPTER X

BRIAN KENT DECIDES


Brian had walked along the riverbank below the house to a spot just
above the point where the high bluff jutting out into the riverchannel
forms Elbow Rock

The bank here is not so high above the roaring waters of the rapids for
the spur of the mountain which forms the cliff lies at a right angle to
the river and the greater part of the cliff is thus on the shore with
its height growing less and less as it merges into the main slope of
the mountainside From the turn in the road in front of the house a
footpath leads down the bank of the river to the cliff and climbing
stairlike up the face of the steep bluff zigzags down the easier slope
of the downriver side to come again into the road below The
road itself below Elbow Rock is forced by the steep side of the
mountainspur and the precipitous bluff to turn inland from the river
and so climbing by an easier grade up past Tom Wardens place crosses
the ridge above the schoolhouse and comes back down the mountain again
in front of Auntie Sues place to its general course along the stream
The little path forms thus a convenient short cut for any one following
the river road on foot

Brian seated on the riverbank a little way from the path where it
starts up the bluff was trying to decide whether it would be better
for him to follow his desire and stay with Auntie Sue for a few weeks
or months or whether he should not in spite of the land he might clear
for her return to the world where he could more quickly earn the money
to pay back that which he had stolen

And as he sat there the man was conscious that he had reached one
of those turningpoints that are found in every life where results
momentous and farreaching are dependent upon comparatively unimportant
and temporary issues He could not have told why and yet he felt a
certainty that for him two widely separated futures were dependent
upon his choice Nor could he by thinking discover what those futures
held for him nor which he should choose Even as his boat that night
had hung on the edge of the eddyhesitating on the dividingline
between the two currentsso the man himself now felt the pull of his
lifecurrents and hesitatedundecided

Looking toward the house he thought how like the life offered by Auntie
Sue was to the quiet waters of The Bend andhis mind finished the
similehow like the life to which he would go was to the rapids at
Elbow Rock and yet he reflected the waters could never reach the
sea without enduring the turmoil of the rapids And again the thought
came The Bend is just as much the river as the troubled passage around
the rock

When he had given up life and to all intent and purpose had left life
behind him the river without his will or knowledge had mysteriously
elected to save him from the death he had chosen as his only refuge from
the utter ruin that had seemed so inevitable As the currents of the
river had carried his boat to the eddy at the foot of Auntie Sues
garden the currents of life had mysteriously brought him to the saving
influence of Auntie Sue herself Should he push out again into the
stream to face the danger he knew beset such a course or should he wait
for a season in the secure calm of the harbor she offered until he were
stronger Brian Kent knew instinctively that there was in the wisdom
and love of Auntie Sues philosophy and faith a strength that would if
he could make it his insure his safe passage through every danger of
life and yetThe mans meditations were interrupted by a chance look
toward the bluff which towered above him

Judy was climbing the steep trail

Curiously Brian watched the deformed mountain girl as she made her way
up the narrow stairlike path and her cutting words came back to him
GodAmighty and my drunken pap made me like I am But youdamn
youyou made yourself what you be And Auntie Sue had said that
the allimportant thing in life was not to DO something but to BE
something

The girl who had gained a point halfway to the top of the bluff paused
to look searchingly about and Brian who was halfhidden by the bushes
started to call to her thinking she might be looking for him but some
impulse checked him and he remained silently watching her Climbing
hurriedly a little higher up the path Judy again stopped to look
carefully around as if searching the vicinity for some one Then once
more she went on until she stood on top of the cliff and now as she
looked about over the surrounding country she called Mr Burns Oh
Mr Burns Whooee Mr Burns

Brians lips were parted to answer the call when something happened on
top of the bluff which held him for the moment speechless

From beyond where Judy stood on the brink of the cliff a mans head
and shoulders appeared Brian saw the girl start and turn to face the
newcomer as if in sudden fear Then she whirled about to run Before she
could gain the point where the path starts down from the top the man
caught her and dragged her roughly back so that the two disappeared
from Brians sight Brian was halfway up the bluff when he heard the
girls shrill scream

There was no sign of weakness now in the man that Judy had dragged
from the river He covered the remaining distance to the top in a
breath From among the bushes a little way down the mountainside came
the sound of an angry voice mingled with Judys pleading cries

An instant more and Brian reached the spot where poor Judy was
crouching on the ground begging the brute who stood over her with
menacing fists not to hit her again

The man was a viciouslooking creature dressed in the rough garb of
the mountaineer dirty and unkempt with evil closeset eyes and a
scraggly beard that could not hide the wicked snarling mouth

He stood for a second looking at Brian as if too surprised by the
latters sudden appearance to move then he went down felled by as
clean a knockout as was ever delivered by an Irish fist

Are you hurt Judy demanded Brian as he lifted the girl to her feet
Did he strike you

He was sure afixin ter lick me somethin awful when youall put in
returned the poor girl trembling with fear I know cause hes done
hit to me heaps er times before Hes my pap

Your father exclaimed Brian

Judy noddedthen screamed Look out Hell git you sure

Judys rescuer whirled to see the man on the ground drawing a gun A
vigorous welldirected kick delivered in the nick of time sent the
gun whirling away into the bushes and rendered the natives right arm
useless

Get up commanded Brian

The man rose to his feet and stood nursing his damaged wrist and
scowling at Judys companion

Are you this girls father

I reckon I am came the sullen reply Im Jap Taylor an youall
are sure goin to find that you cant come between a man an his lawful
child in these here mountains misterif youall be from the city

And you will find that you cant strike a crippled girl in my presence
even if she is your daughterin these mountains or anywhere else
retorted Brian What are you trying to do with her anyway

I aim ter take her back home with me where she belongs

Well why didnt you go to the house for her like a man instead of
jumping on her out here in the woods

Hit aint none of your dad burned business as I can see came the
sullen reply

I am making it my business just the same returned Brian

He turned to the girl who had drawn back a little behind him Judy
he said kindly I think perhaps you better tell me about this

Pap he was alayin for me in the bresh cause he dassnt come to the
house ter git me said the girl fearfully

But why does he fear to come to the house persisted Brian

Cause he done give me ter Auntie Sue

Gave you to Auntie Sue repeated the puzzled Brian

Jap Taylor interrupted with I didnt sign ary paper an

Shut up you snapped Brian Go on Judy

Hit was a year last cornplantin explained the girl My maw she
died He used ter whip her too An Auntie Sue was there helpin weuns
an Tom Warden an some other folks they was there too an they done
fixed hit so that I was ter go an live with Auntie Sue an pap he
give me ter her He sure did Mr Burns an I aint awantin ter go
with him no more

The poor girls shrill monotone broke and her twisted body shook with
her sobs

I didnt sign ary paper repeated Judys father with sullen
stubbornness An whats more I sure aint agoin ter I lows as how
shell just go home an work for me like she ort stead of livin with
that there oldmaid schoolmaam Im her paw I am an I reckon I got
rights

He started toward the girl who drew closer to Brian and begged
piteously Dont let him tech me Fore God Mr Burns hell kill me
sure

Brian drew the girl behind him as he faced the father with a brief Get
out

The mountaineer hesitated

Brian went one step toward him Do you hear Get out And if you ever
show your dirty face in this vicinity again Ill not leave a whole bone
in your worthless carcass

And Jap Taylor saw something in those Irish blue eyes that caused him to
start off down the mountain toward the river below Elbow Rock

When he had placed a safe distance between himself and the man who
appeared so willing and able to make good his threat Judys father
turned and shaking his uninjured fist at Brian delivered a volley
of curses with Ill sure git youall for this Jap Taylor aint
alettin no man come between him an hisn Ill fix you an Ill fix
that there schoolmaam too Shes nothin but a damned old

But Brian started toward him and Jap Taylor beat a hasty retreat

Never mind Judy said Brian when the native had disappeared in the
brush and timber that covered the steep mountainside Ill not let
him touch you Come let us sit down and talk a little until you are
yourself again Auntie Sue must not see you like this We dont want to
let her know anything about it You wont tell her will you

I aint aimin ter tell nobody said Judy between sobs I sure aint
awantin ter make no troublenot for Auntie Sue nohow Shes been
powerful good ter me

When they were seated on convenient rocks at the brink of the cliff
overlooking the river Judy gradually ceased crying and presently said
in her normal querulous monotone Did youall mind what pap lowed
hed do ter Auntie Sue Mr Burns

Yes Judy but dont worry child He is not going to harm any one
while I am around

Youall are aimin ter stay then be you Im sure powerful glad said
Judy simply

Brian started A new factor had suddenly been injected into his problem

I was powerful scared youall was aimin ter go away continued Judy
Hit was that I was ahuntin youall to tell you bout when pap he
ketched me

What were you going to tell me Judy

I lowed ter tell youall bout Auntie Sue Shed sure be powerful mad
if she knowd Id said anythin ter you but shes aneedin somebody
like you ter help her mighty bad Sheshes done lost a heap of money
lately hit was some she sent

Brian interrupted Wait a minute Judy You must not tell me anything
about Auntie Sues private affairs you must not tell any one Anything
she wants me to know she will tell me Do you understand he finished
with a reassuring smile

Yes sir I reckon youall are bout right an I wont tell nobody
nothin But taint agoin ter hurt none ter say as how youall ort
ter stay I reckon

And why do you think I ought to stay Judy

Cause of what Auntie Sues done for youallanursin you when you
was plumb crazy an plumb dangerous from licker an a lyin like she
did ter the Sheriff an that there deteckertive man returned Judy
stoutly an cause shes so old an is aneedin youall ter help her
an cause she is alovin you like she does an is awantin youall
ter stay so bad hits mighty nigh amakin her plumb sick

Brian Kent did not answer The mountain girls words had revealed to him
the selfishness of his own consideration of his problem so clearly that
he was stunned Why had he not in his thinking remembered the dear old
gentlewoman who had saved him from a shameful death

Judy went on Hit looks ter me like somebody just naturallys got ter
take care of Auntie Sue Mr Burns All her whole life shes abeen
takin care of everybody just like she tuck me an just like she tuck
youall besides a heap of other ways an now shes so old and mighty
nigh plumb wore out hit sure looks like hit was time somebody was
afixin ter do somethin for her That was what I was ahuntin youall
ter tell you when pap ketched me Mr Burns

I am glad you told me Judyvery glad You see I was not thinking of
things in just that way

I lowed maybe you mightnt Seems like folks mostly dont

But its all right now Brian cried heartily You have settled it
Ill stay Well take care of Auntie Sueyou and I Judy Come on
now lets go to the house and tell her But we wont say anything
about your father Judythat would only make her unhappy and we must
never make Auntie Sue unhappynever He was as eager and enthusiastic
now as a schoolboy

Course said Judy solemnly course you just naturally got ter stay
an take care of her now after what paps done said hed do

Yes Judy Ive just naturally got to stay returned Brian

Together they went down the steep cliff trail and to the little log
house by the river to announce Brians decision to Auntie Sue They
found the dear old lady in her favorite spot on the porch overlooking
the river

Why of course you will stay she returned when Brian had told her
The river brought you to me and you know my dear boy the river is
never wrong Oh yes I know there are crosscurrents and crooked spots
and sandbars and rocks and lots of places where it SEEMS to us to be
wrong But just the same it all goes on all the time toward the sea
for which it starts when it first begins at some little spring away
over there somewhere in the mountains Of course you will stay with me
Brianuntil the river carries you on again



CHAPTER XI

RECREATION


From the very day of his decision to which he had been so unexpectedly
helped by Judy Brian Kent was another man The gloomy despondent
undecided spirit that was the successor of the wretched creature that
Judy had helped to Auntie Sues that morning was now succeeded by a
cheerful hopeful contented man who went to his daily task with a
song did his work with a smile and a merry jest and returned when the
day was done with peace in his heart and laughter on his lips

As the days of the glorious Ozark autumn passed Brians healthful
outdoor work on the timbered mountainside brought to the man of the
cities a physical grace and beauty he had lackedthe grace of physical
strength and the beauty of clean and rugged health The bright autumn
sun and the winds that swept over the many miles of treeclad hills
browned his skin while his work with the ax developed his muscles and
enforced deep breathing of the bracing mountain air thus bringing
a more generous supply of richer blood which touched his now firmly
rounded cheeks with color

The gift of humor and the faculty of quaint and witty conversational
twists with the genius of storytelling that was his from his Irish
mother made quick friends for him of the mountain neighbors who
welcomed this new pupil of their old schoolteacher with wholehearted
pleasure and quoted his jests and sayings throughout the country with
neverfailing delight And Judyit is not too much to say that Judy
became his most ardent admirer and devoted slave

But the dear old mistress of the little log house by the river alone
recognized that these outward changes in the human wreck that the
river had brought to her were but manifestations of a more potent
transformation that was taking place in the mans inner life and it was
this inner change that filled the teachers loving heart with joy and
which she watched with keen and delighted interest

It was not after all a new life that was coming to this man Auntie
Sue told herself it was his own old and more real life that was
reassuring itself It was the real Brian Kent that had been sojourning
in a far country that was now coming home to his own It was the wealth
of his heart and mind and soul which had been deepburied under an
accumulation of circumstances and environment that was now being brought
to the surface

Might it not be that Auntie Sues genius for absorbing beauty and making
truth her own had in her many years of searching for truth and beauty
in whatever humanity she encountered developed in her a peculiar
sensitiveness And was it not this that had made her feel instinctively
the real nature of the man in whom a less discerning observer would have
recognized nothing worthy of admiration or regard Without question
it was the truethe essentialthe underlyingelements in the
character of the absconding bank clerk that had aroused in this
remarkable old gentlewoman the peculiar sense of kinshipof
possessionthat had determined her attitude toward the stranger The
law that like calls to like is not less applicable to things spiritual
than to things material The birds of a feather that always flock
together are not of necessity material birds of material feathers

Nor was Brian Kent himself unconscious of his ReCreation The man knew
what he was as every man knows deep within himself the real self that
is And that was the horror of the situation which had set him adrift on
the river that night when in his last drunken despairing frenzy he had
left the world with a curse in his heart and had faced the black unknown
with reckless laughter and a profane toast It is to be doubted if
there can be a hell of greater torment than that experienced by one who
endowed by nature with a capacity for great living is betrayed by the
very strength of his genius into a situation that is intolerable of his
real self and is forced thus to a continuous selfcrucifixion and
death

In his new environment the man felt the awakening of this self which he
had mourned as dead Thoughts emotions dreams aspirations which had
as he believed been killed he found were not dead but only sleeping
and in the quickening of their vitality and strength he knew a joy as
great as had been his despair

The beauty of nature that had lost its power of appeal to his sodden
soul now stirred him to the very depth of his being The crisp
sunsweet air of the autumn mornings when he went forth with his ax
to the days clean labor was a draught of potent magic that set every
nerve of him tingling with delight The woodland hillside where he
worked was a wonderland of beautiful creations that inspired a thousand
glowing fancies Sometimes at his heavy task he would pause for a
moments rest and so would look out and away over the vast expanse of
country that from his feet stretched in all its charm of winding river
and wooded slopes and treefringed ridges to the far blue skyline
and the very soul of him would answer to the call as he had thought he
never could answer again The very clouds that drifted past on their
courses to unseen ports beyond the hills were freighted with meaning for
him now The winds that came laden with the subtly blended perfume
of ten thousand varieties of trees and grasses and shrubs and flowers
whispered words of life which he now could hear The loveliness of the
glowing morning skies as he saw them when he rose for the days work
and the glories of the sunsets as he watched them with Auntie Sue
from the porch when the days task was accomplished filled him with an
exquisite gladness which he had never hoped to know again

Most of all did the river speak to him not indeed as it had spoken
that dreadful night when from the window of his darkened room he had
listened to its call the river spoke now in the full day as his eye
followed its winding length through the hills in all its varied beauty
of sunshine and shadowof gleaming silver and living green and
russetbrown It talked to him in the evening when the waters gave back
the glories of the sky and the deepening twilight wrapped the world in
its dusky veil of mystery It spoke to him in the soft darkness of the
night as it swept on its way under the stars or in the light of the
golden moon And in time some of these things which the river said to
him he in turn told to Auntie Sue

And Auntie Sue delighted with the mans awakening self and charmed
with his power of thought and his gift of expression led him on
With artful suggestion and skilful question and subtle argument she
stimulated his mind and fancy to lay hold of the truths and beauties
that life and nature offered But ever the rare old gentlewoman was his
teacher revealing himself to himself guiding him to a fuller discovery
and knowledge of his own life and its meaning which indeed is the
true aim and end of all right teaching

So the days of the autumn passed The hills changed their robes of
varied green for costumes of brown and gold with touches here and there
of flaming scarlet and brilliant yellow And then winter was at hand
and that momentous evening came when Auntie Sue said to her pupil after
an hour of most interesting talk Brian why in the world dont you
write a book

A book exclaimed Brian in a startled tone

Judy laughed He sure ought ter Lord knows he talks like one

I am in earnest Brian said Auntie Sue her lovely old eyes shining
with enthusiasm and her gentle voice trembling with excitement I have
been thinking about it for a long time now and tonight I just cant
keep it to myself any longer Why dont you give to the world some of
the thoughts you have been wasting on Judy and me

Hits sure been awastin of em on me agreed Judy Fore God I
dont sense what hes atalkin bout moren half the time

Brian laughed Judy is prophetic Auntie Sue She voices perfectly the
sentiment of the world toward any book I might write

Auntie Sue detected a note of bitterness underlying the laughing
comment and wondered

Judy spoke again as she arose to retire to her room for the night I
reckon as how theres a right smart of things youuns talk thatd be
mighty fine if a body only had the learnin ter sense em An there
must be heaps of folks where youuns come from what would know Mr
Burnss meaning if he was to write hit all out plain Everybody aint
like me Hits sure a Godsblessin they aint too

And there Brian dear is your answer said Auntie Sue as Judy left
the room Any book has meaning only for those who have the peculiar
sympathy and understanding needed to interpret it A book that means
nothing to one may be rich in meaning for another Every writer writes
for his own peculiar readers just as every individual has his own
peculiar friends

Or enemies said Brian

Or enemies agreed Auntie Sue

Brian went to the window and stood for some time looking out into the
night Then turning with a nervous gesture he paced uneasily up
and down the room while Auntie Sue watched him in silence with an
expression of loving concern on her dear old face

At last she spoke Why Brian what is the matter What have I said
I did not mean to upset you like this Come sit down here and tell me
about it What is it troubles you so

With a short laugh Brian came and stood before her I suppose it had
to come sooner or later Auntie Sue I have been trying for days to
muster up courage enough to tell you about it You have touched the one
biggest thing in my life

Why what do you mean Brian

I mean just what we have been talking aboutwriting answered Brian

Oh she cried with quick and delighted triumph Then I AM right You
have been thinking about it too

Thinking about it he echoed and in his voice she felt the nervous
intensity of his mood I have thought of nothing else All day long
when I am at work I am writing writing writing It is the last thing
on my mind when I go to sleep I dream about it all night And it is
the first thing I think about in the morning

Auntie Sue clasped her hands to her heart with an exclamation of joyous
interest

Brian with a quiet smile at her enthusiasm went on I know exactly
what I want to say and why I want to say it There is a world of
people Auntie Sue whose lives have been broken and spoiled by one
thing or another and who have more or less cut themselves loose from
everything and are just drifting they dont care a hang where because
they think they have failed so completely that there is nothing more
in life for them People like meI dont mean thieves and criminals
necessarilywho have had that which they know to be the best and
biggest and truest part of themselves tortured and warped and twisted
and denied and smashed and beaten and betrayed and killed and who
because they feel that their real selves are dead within them dont
care what happens to that part which is left

He was walking the floor again now and speaking with a depth of feeling
which he had never before revealed to his gentle companion

It is not so much the love of wrongdoing that makes people turn
badhe continuedit is having their real selves misunderstood and
doubted and smothered and their realest loves and dreams and aspirations
never recognized or else distorted and twisted and made to appear
as something they hate I want to make the peopleand there are many
thousands of themwho are suffering in the living hell that tormented
me feel that I know and understand And then Auntie Sue then I want
to tell them about you and your river

I would teach them the things you have taught me I would say to every
one that I could persuade to listen It doesnt in the least matter
what your experience is the old river is still going on to the sea
No matter if every woman you ever knew has proved untrue virtuous
womanhood still IS No matter if every man you ever knew has proved
false true manhood still IS If every friend you ever had has betrayed
your friendship loyal friendship still IS If you have found nothing
in your experience but dishonesty and falsehood and infidelity and
hypocrisy it is only because you have been unfortunate in your
experience because honesty and fidelity and sincerity are existing
FACTS They are the very foundation facts of life and can no more fail
life than the river can fail to reach the sea

Your little individual experience my little individual
experiencewhat are they They are nothing more than the tiny bubbles
swirls ripples and breaks on the surface of the great volume of water
that flows so inevitably onward The bit of foam the tiny wave caused
by twig or branch or blade of watergrass or the great rocks and cliffs
that make the roaring whirlpools and rapidsdo they stay the waters
or turn the river back on its course or in any way prevent its
onward flow No more can the twigs of circumstances or the boughs of
environment or the grasses of accident that make the tiny waves of our
individual experiencesor even the great rocks and cliffs of national
or racial importsuch as wars and pestilence and faminefinally
check or stay the river of life in its onward flow toward the sea of its
final and infinite meaning

He went again to the window and stood looking out into the night as
though listening to the voices

Why Auntie Sue he said turning back to the old gentlewomanand
his face was radiant with the earnestness of this thoughtAuntie Sue
there are as many currents in our river out there as there are human
lives A comparatively few great main or dominant currents in the river
flowa comparatively few great dominant currents in the river flow of
life But if you look closer you will see that in each one of
those established principal currents there are countless
thousandsmillionsof tiny currents all turning and twisting across
and back and up and down in every directionweaving
themselves togetherpulling themselves apartcrisscrossing
clashinginterlacingtangled and confusedand these are the
individual lives And no matter what the conflict or confusion no
matter what direction they take for the moment they all ALL go to
make up the riverthey all together ARE the riverand they all
together move onwardceaselessly inevitably irresistibly

He paused to stand smiling down at her as she sat there in her low
chair beside the table with the lamplight on her silvery hairthere in
the little log house by the river

That is what you have made your river mean to me Auntie Sue and that
is what I would give to the world

With trembling hands the gentle old teacher reached for her
handkerchief which lay in the sewingbasket on the table beside her
Smilingly she wiped away the tears that filled her eyes Lovingly
she looked up at himstanding so tall and strong before her with his
reddish hair tumbled and tossed and his Irish blue eyes lighted with
the fire of his inspiration

Well she said at last why dont you do it Brian

As a breath of air puts out the light of a candle so the light went
from Brian Kents face Dropping into his chair he answered hopelessly
Because I am afraid

Afraid echoed Auntie Sue troubled and amazed What in the world are
you afraid of Brian

And the bitter bitter answer came I am afraid of another failure

Auntie Sues quick mind caught the significance of his words ANOTHER
failure Brian Then youthen you have written before

Yes he returned And not since his decision to remain with her had
she seen him so despondent To write was the dream and the passion of
my life I tried and tried God how I worked and slaved at it The only
result from my efforts was the hell from which you dragged me

Alter a little silence Auntie Sue said gently I dont think I
understand Brian You have never told me about your trouble you know

It is an old old story he returned I am only one of thousands My
wretched experience is not at all uncommon

I know she answered But dont you think that perhaps you had better
tell me Perhaps in the mere telling of it to me now that it is all
over you may find the real reason forfor what happened to you

Wise Auntie Suewise in that rarest of all wisdomthe sympathetic
understanding of human hearts and souls

You know about my earlier life he began how in my boyhood after
mothers death I worked at anything I could do to keep myself alive
and how I managed to gain a little schooling I was always dreaming of
writing even then I took the business course in a nightschool not
because I liked it but because I thought it would help me to earn a
living in a way that would give me more time for what I really wanted
to do And after I finished school and had finally worked up to a good
position in that bank I did have more time for my writing Buthe
hesitatedIwellother interests had come into my lifeand

Auntie Sue said softly She did not understand Brian

No she did not understand he continued accepting Auntie Sues
interpretation without comment And when my writing brought no money
because no publisher would accept my stuff and the conditions under
which I wrote became intolerable because of misunderstanding and
opposition and disbelief in my ability and charges of neglect
IIstole money from my employers to gain temporary relief until my
writing should amount to something You see I could not help believing
that I would succeed in time I suppose all dreamers have more or less
confidence in their dreams they must you know or their dreams would
never be realized I always expected to pay back the money I took with
the money I would earn by my pen But I failed to earn anything you
see and thenthen the inevitable happened and the river brought me to
you

But my dear boy cried Auntie Sue all this that you have told me
is no reason why you should fear to write now Indeed it is a very good
reason why you should not fear

He looked at her questioningly and she continued You have given every
reason in the world why you failed Your whole life was out of tune
How could you expect to produce anything worthy from such a jangling
discord You should have been afraid indeed to write THEN But
NOWnow Brian you are ready You are a long long way down the river
from the place of your failures The disturbing distracting things
are pastjust as in the quiet reach of the river below Elbow Rock the
turmoil of the rapids is past You say that you know exactly what
you want to write and why you want to write itand you do knowand
because you knowbecause you have sufferedbecause you have
learnedbecause you can do this thing for othersit is yours to do
and so you must do it What you really mean when you say you are afraid
to write is that you are AFRAID NOT TO she finished with a little
laugh of satisfaction

And Brian Kent as he watched her glowing face and felt the sincerity
and confidence that vibrated in her voice was thrilled with a new
courage The fires of his inspiration shone again in his eyes as he
answered with deep conviction Auntie Sue I believe you are right
What a woman you are



CHAPTER XII

AUNTIE SUE TAKES A CHANCE


So Brian wrote his book that winter

When the days were fair he worked with his ax on the mountainside But
his notebook was ever at hand and many a thought that went down on the
pages of his manuscript was born while he wrought with his hands in the
wholesome labor which gave strength to his body and clearness to his
brain In the evenings he wrote in the little log house by the river
with Auntie Sue sitting in her chair beside the tablethe lamplight
on her silvery hair and her sewingbasket within reach of her
handengaged with some bit of needlework a book or perhaps with one
of her famous letters to some other pupil far away The stormy days
gave him many hours with his pen and so the book grew

And always as the man endeavored to shape his thoughts for the printed
pages that would carry his message to the doubting disconsolate and
fearful world that he knew so well he heard in his heart the voices of
the river From the hillside where he worked in the timber he could see
the stream winding through the snowy hills like a dark line carelessly
drawn with many a crook and curve and break on the sheet of white From
the porch he saw the quiet Bend a belt of shining ice and snow save for
a narrow line in the centre which marked the course of the strongest
currents while the waters of the rapids crashed black and dreadful
against the Elbow Rock cliff which stood gaunt and grim amid the
surrounding whiteness and in the deathlike hush of the winter twilight
the roar of the turmoil sounded with persistent menace And all that the
river said to him he put downso far as it was given him to do

And that which Brian Kent wrote was good He knew itin his deepest
truest self he knew And Auntie Sue knew it for of course he read
to her from his manuscript as the book grew under his hand Even Judy
caught much of his storys meaning and marvelled at herself because
she too could understand

So the spring came and the first writing of the book was nearly
finished

And now the question arose What would they do about the final
preparation of the manuscript for the printers Brian explained that he
should have a typewritten copy of his script which he would work over
correct and revise and from which perfected copy the final manuscript
would be typewritten But neither Auntie Sue nor Brian would consider
his finishing the book anywhere but in the little log house by the
river even if there had been no other reason why Brian should not go to
the city if it could be avoided

There is only one thing to dosaid Auntie Sue at last when the
matter had been discussed several timeswe must send for Betty Jo
She has been studying stenography in a business college in Cincinnati
and in her latest letter to me she wrote that she would finish in
April Ill just write her to come right here and bring her typewriter
along She will need a vacation and she can have it and do your work at
the same time Besides I need to see Betty Jo She hasnt been to visit
me since before Judy came

Brian thought that Auntie Sue seemed a little nervous and excited as she
spoke but he attributed it to her combined interest in the book and in
the proposed typist The man could not know the real cause of his gentle
old companions agitation nor with what anxiety she had considered the
matter for many days before she announced her plan The fact was that
Auntie Sue was taking a big chance and she realized it fully But
she could find no other way to secure the services of a competent
stenographer for Brian and as Brian must have a competent stenographer
in order to finish his book properly she had decided to accept the
risk

That sounds all right Auntie Sue returned Brian But who pray
tell is Betty Jo

Betty Jo isAuntie Sue paused and laughed with a suggestion of
embarrassed confusionBetty Jo isjust Betty Jo Brian she
finished

Brian laughed now Fine Auntie Sue That describes her exactlytells
me her lifes history and gives me a detailed account of her
familyancestors and all

It describes her with more accuracy than you think retorted Auntie
Sue smiling in return at his teasing manner

I reckon as how shes got more of er name than that aint she said
Judy who was a silent but intensely interested listener Ive
allus took notice that folks with funny namesll stand a right smart of
watchin

Brian and Auntie Sue laughed together at this but the old lady said
with a show of spirit Judy You know nothing about it You never even
saw Betty Jo You shouldnt say such things child

Might as well say em as ter think em I reckon Judy returned her
beadyblack eyes stealthily watching Brian

What is your Betty Jos real name Auntie Sue asked Brian curiously

Again Auntie Sue seemed to hesitate thenHer name is Miss Betty Jo
Williams and as she spoke the old teacher looked straight at Brian

A perfectly good name Brian returned but I never heard of her
before

Judys black eyes with their stealthy oblique look were now
watchfully fixed on Auntie Sue

She is the orphanniece of one of my old pupils Auntie Sue continued
I have known her since she was a baby When she finished her education
in the seminary and had travelled abroad for a few months she decided
all at once that she wanted a course in a business college which was
just what any one knowing her would expect her to do

Sounds steady and reliable commented Brian But will she come

Yes indeed she will and be tickled to death over the job returned
Auntie Sue Ill write her at once

While Auntie Sue was preparing to write her letter Judy muttered in
a tone which only Brian heard Just the same taint no name for a
common gal ter have hit sure aint Theres somethin dad burned queer
bout hit somewhere

Nonsense Judy said Brian in a low voice dont worry Auntie Sue

I aint aimin ter worry her none returned the mountain girl but
Ill bet youall a pretty that this here galll worry both of youuns
fore you are through with herme too I reckon

For some reason Auntie Sues letter to Betty Jo seemed to be rather
long In fact she spent the entire evening at it which led Judy to
remark that hit sure looked like Auntie Sue was aimin ter write a book
herself

A neighbor who went to Thompsonville the following day with a load of
hogs for shipment posted the letter And in due time another neighbor
brought the answer Betty Jo would come

It was the day following the evening when Brian wrote the last page of
his book that another letter came to Auntie Suea letter which for
the second time very nearly wrecked Brian Kents world



CHAPTER XIII

JUDY TO THE RESCUE


Brian was working in the garden It was early in the afternoon and the
man as he worked in the freshly ploughed ground was rejoicing at the
completion of his book

Straightening up from his labor he drew a deep breath of the fragrant
air About him on every side and far away into the blue distance the
world was dressed in the gala dress of the season The river which at
the breaking of the winter had been a yellow flood that washed the top
of the bank in front of the house and covered the bottomlands on the
opposite side was again its normal self and its voice to him now was
a singing voice of triumphal gladness

For Brian too the world was new and fresh and beautiful The world
of his winter was gone He had found himself in his work and in the
glorious consciousness of the fact he felt like shouting with sheer joy
of living

And Auntie Sue dear Auntie Sue he thought looking with love in
his eyes toward the house how wonderful she had been in her helpful
understanding and neverfailing faith in him After all it was Auntie
Sues triumph more than it was his

His happy musing was interrupted by a neighbor who on his way home from
Thompsonville stopped at the garden fence with the letter for Auntie
Sue

Brian took the letter with a jest which brought a roar of laughter from
the mountaineer and when the latter had gone on his way up the hill
started toward the house to find Auntie Sue

Glancing at the envelope in his hand Brian noticed the postmark Buenos
Aires He stopped suddenly staring dumbly at the words in the circular
mark and at the name written on the envelope Over and over he
read Buenos AiresMiss Susan Wakefield Buenos AiresMiss Susan
Wakefield SomethingHis brain seemed to be numb His hands trembled
He looked about at the familiar surroundings and everything seemed
suddenly strange and unreal to him He looked again at the letter in his
hand turning it curiously A strange feeling of oppression and ominous
foreboding possessed him as though the bright spring sky were all at
once overcast with heavy and menacing stormclouds What was it Buenos
AiresSusan Wakefield Where had he seen that combination before
What was it that made the name of the Argentine city in connection with
Auntie Sues name seem so familiar Slowly he went on to the house
and finding Auntie Sue gave her the letter

Oh cried the old lady as she saw the postmark on the envelope It
must be from brother John It is not Johns writing though she added
as she opened the envelope

And at her words the feeling of impending disaster so oppressed Brian
Kent that only by an effort could he control himself He was possessed
of the strange sensation of having at some time in the past lived the
identical experience through which he was at that moment passing Susan
Wakefielda brother John in Buenos Aires Argentinethe letter It
was all so familiar that the allusion was startling in its force But
that ominous cloudthat sense of some great trouble near that filled
him with such unaccountable dreadwhat could it mean

An exclamation from Auntie Sue drew his attention She looked at him
with tearfilled eyes and her sweet voice broke as she said Brian
Brian John is dead Thisthis letter is from the doctor who attended
him

Tenderly as he would have helped his own mother Brian assisted Auntie
Sue to her room For a little while he sat with her trying to comfort
her with such poor words as he could find

Briefly she told him of the brother who had lived in Argentine for many
years He had married a SouthAmerican woman whom Auntie Sue had never
seen and while not wealthy had been moderately prosperous But he
had never forgotten his sister who was so alone in the world Several
times when he could he sent me money for my savingsbank account she
finished simply her sweet old voice low and tender with the memories
of the years that were gone John and I were always very fond of each
other He was a good man Brian

Brian Kent sat like a man stricken dumb Auntie Sues words he sent me
money for my savingsbank account had made the connection between the
names Buenos Aires Argentine John Wakefield Susan Wakefield and
the thing for which his mind had been groping with such a sense of
impending disaster

In her grief over the death of her brother and in her memories of their
home years so long past dear old Auntie Sue had forgotten the peculiar
meaning her words might have for the former clerk of the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank who sat beside her and to whom she turned in
her sorrow as a mother to a dearly beloved son

But it is all right Brian dear she said with brave cheerfulness
When one has watched the sunsets for seventy years one ceases to fear
the coming of the night for always there is the morning Just let me
rest here alone for a little while and I will be myself again

She looked up at him with a smile and Brian Kent kneeling beside the
bed bowed his head and caught the dear old hands to his lips Without
trusting himself to speak again the man left the roomclosing the
door

He moved about the apartment as one in a dream With a vividness that
was torture he lived again that hour in the bank when opening the
afternoon mail he had found the letter from Susan Wakefield with the
Argentine notes which her letter said she had received from her brother
John in Buenos Aires and which she was sending to the bank for deposit
to her little account It had been a very unbusinesslike letter and a
very unbusinesslike way to transmit money It was indeed this nature
of the transaction that had tempted the hardpressed clerk

Mechanically Brian stopped at his writingtable to finger the
manuscript which he had finished the evening before Was it only the
evening before Taking up the volume of closely written sheets which
were bound together by a shoestring that Auntie Sue had laughingly found
for him when he had so joyously announced the completion of the last
page of his book he turned the leaves idlyreading here and there
a sentence with curious interest The terrific mental strain of his
situation completely divorced him as it were from the life which he
had lived during those happy months just past and which was so fully
represented by his work

Again the river swinging around a sudden turn in its course had come
upon a passage where its peaceful flow was broken by the wild turmoil of
the troubled waters

And Auntie Suesomething within the mans self was sayingdear
Auntie Sue who had saved him not only from death but from the hell
of the life that he had formerly lived as well and whose loving
companionship and sympathetic understanding had so inspired and
strengthened him in the work which had been the passionate desire of his
heartthe gentle old teacher whose life had been so completely given
to others and who in the helplessness of her last years was so
aloneAuntie Sue was depending upon that money which her brother had
sent her as the only support of the closing days of her life Auntie Sue
believed that her money was safe in the bank That belief was to her
a daily comfort Auntie Sue did not know that she was almost
pennilessthat the man whom she had saved with such a wondrous
salvation had robbed her and left her so shamefully without means
for the necessities of life Auntie Sue did not know But she would
knowthat inner voice went on The time would come when she
would learn the truth It was certain to come It might come any day
Thenthen

As one moving without conscious purpose Brian Kent went from the
housethe manuscript in his hand

Judy was sitting idly on the porch steps At sight of the mountain girl
the man knew all at once that there was one thing he must do He must
make sure that there was no mistake He was already sure of course but
still as a condemned man at the scaffold hopes against hope for a stay
of sentence so he caught at the shadowy suggestion of a possibility

Come with me Judy he said forcing himself to speak coolly I want
to talk with you

Judy arose and looking at him in her stealthy oblique way said
in her drawling monotone Whats happened ter Auntie Sue Was there
somethin in that there letter Bud Jackson give youall for her whats
upset her

Auntie Sues brother is dead Judy Brian answered She wishes to be
alone and we must not disturb her She will be all right in a little
while Come let us walk down toward the bluff

When they had reached a spot on the riverbank a short distance above
the Elbow Rock cliff Brian said to his companion Judy I want you
to tell me something Did Auntie Sue ever send money in a letter to the
Empire Consolidated Savings Bank in Chicago

The black beady eyes shifted evasively and the mountain girl turned
her sallow oldyoung face away from Brians direct gaze

Look at me Judy

She sent a stealthy oblique glance in his direction

You must tell me

I done started ter tell youall onctthat time pap ketched mean
youall lowed as how I oughten ter tell nothin bout Auntie Sue to
nobody

But it is different now Judy returned Brian Something has happened
that makes it necessary for me to know

Meanin that there letter bout her brother bein dead asked Judy
shrewdly

Yes

What youall got ter know for

Because Brian could not finish

Judys beady eyes were watching him intently now Hit looks like
youall aint aneedin me ter tell youall anythin she observed
dryly

Then Auntie Sue did send money

She sure did I seed her fix hit in the letter myself came the
answer

What kind of money

I dunnosome funny kind hit waswhat her brother done sent her from
some funny place I dunno just where

When did she send it

Bout a month fore you come

Andand did any letter ever come from the bank to tell her that the
money was received by them all right

The mountain girl did not answer but again turned her face away

Tell me Brian insisted IImust know Judy and his voice was
harsh and broken with emotion

The answer came reluctantly I reckon youall knows where that there
money went ter

The girls answer sent a new thought like a hot iron into Brian Kents
tortured brain He caught Judys arm in quick and fearful excitement
Judy he gasped imploringly Judy do you does Auntie Sue know
does she know that I

How could she help knowin She aint no fool An I done heard that
there Sheriff an the deteckertive man tellin her bout you an the
bank An the Sheriff he done give her a paper what he said told all
bout what youall done an she must er burned the paper or done
somethin with hit cause I couldnt never find hit after that night
An what would she do that for And what for did she make me promise not
ter ever say nothin ter youall bout that there money letter An why
aint she said nothin to you bout the letter from the bank not comin
if she didnt know hit was you stead of them what done got the money

The girl paused for a moment and then went on in a tone of reverent
wonder An to think that all the time she could aturned youall over
to that there Sheriff an got the moneyreward to pay her back what
youall done tuck

Brian Kent was as one who had received a mortal hurt His features were
distorted with suffering With eyes that could not see he looked down
at the manuscript to which he still unconsciously clung and again
he fingered the pages of his work as though some blind instinct were
sending his tormented soul to seek relief in the message which during
the happy months just past he had written for others

And the deformed mountain girl who stood before him with twisted body
and oldyoung face grew fearful as she watched the suffering of this
man whom she had come to look upon as a superior being from some world
which she in her ignorance could never know

Mr Burns she said at last putting out her hand and plucking at his
sleeve Mr Burns youall aint got no call ter be like this Youall
aint plumb bad I knows you aint count of the way youall have
been ter me an cause you kept pap from hurtin me an cause you are
takin care of Auntie Sue like youre doin Hit aint no matter bout
the money now cause youall kin take care of her allus

Brian looked up from the manuscript in his hand and stared dumbly at
the girl as if he failed to hear her clearly

An just think bout your book Judy continued pleadingly Think
bout all them fine things youall have done wrote down for everybody
ter readbout the river allus agoin on just the same no matter
what happens an bout Auntie Sue an

She stopped and drew away from him frightened at the look that came
into the mans face

Dont Mr Burns Dont she halfscreamed Fore God youall
oughten ter look like that

The man threw up his head and laughedlaughed as the wild reckless
and lost Brian Kent had laughed that black night when in the drifting
boat he had cursed the life he was leaving and had drunk his profane
toast to the darkness into which he was being carried

Raising the manuscript which represented all that the past months of
his recreated life had meant to him and grasping it in both hands he
shook it contemptuously as he said with indescribable bitterness and
the reckless surrendering of every hope All them fine things that I
have wrote down for everybody ter read He mimicked her voice with a
sneer and laughed again Then Its all a lie Judy deara damned
lie Auntie Sue is a saint and believes it She made me believe it
for a little whileher beautiful impossible dreamphilosophy of the
river The riverhellthe river is as treacherous and cruel and
false and tricky and crooked as life itself And I am as warped and
twisted in mind and soul as you are in body Judy dear Neither of us
can help it We were made that way by the river To hell with the whole
impossible mess of things With a gesture of violent rage he turned
toward the river and taking a step forward lifted the manuscript high
above his head

Judy screamed Mr Burns dont

He paused an instant and turning his head looked at her with another
laugh

Fore God you dassnt do that she implored

And then as the man turned his face from her and his arms went back
above his head for the swing that would send the manuscript far out into
the tumbling waters of the rapids she leaped toward him and catching
his arm hampered his movement so that the book fell a few feet from the
shore where the water checked a little in its onward rush to the cliff
by the irregular bank boiled and eddied among the rocky ledges and huge
boulders that retarded its force Another leap carried the mountain girl
to the edge of the bank where she crouched like a runner ready for
the report of the starters pistol her black beady eyes searching the
stream for the volume of manuscript which had disappeared from sight
drawn down by the troubled swirling currents

The man watching her laughed in derision but while his mocking
laughter was still on his lips the boiling currents brought the book
again to the surface and Brian saw the girl leave the bank as if
thrown by a powerful spring Straight and true she dived for the book
and even as she disappeared beneath the surface her hands clutched the
manuscript

For a second Brian Kent held his place as if paralyzed with horror
Then as Judys head appeared farther down the stream he ran with
all his strength along the bank to gain a point a little ahead of the
swimming girl before he should leap to her rescue

But Judy trained from her birth on that mountain river knew better
than Brian what to do A short distance below the point where she had
plunged into the stream a huge boulder some two or three feet from the
shore caused a split in the current one fork of which set in toward
the bank Swimming desperately the girl gained the advantage of this
current and just as Brian reached the spot she was swept against
the bank where with her free hand she caught and held fast to a
projecting root Had she been carried past that point nothing could
have saved her from being swept on into the wild turmoil of the waters
at Elbow Rock

It was the work of a moment for Brian to throw himself flat on the
ground at the edge of the bank and reaching down to grasp the girls
wrist Another moment and she was safe beside him his manuscript still
tightly held under one arm

Not realizing in his excitement what he was doing Brian shook the
girl saying angrily What in the world do you mean taking such a
crazyfool chance as that

She broke away from him with Well whatd youall go an do such a
dad burned fool thing for Hits youall whats crazy yourselfplumb
crazy

Brian held out his hand Give me that manuscript

Judy clutched the book tighter and drew back defiantly I wont
Youall done throwed hit away onct Taint yourn no more nohow

Well what do you purpose to do with it said the puzzled man in a
gentler tone

I aims ter give hit ter Auntie Sue came the startling reply I
reckon shell know what ter do Hit allus was more hern than yourn
anyhow You done said so yourself I heard you only last night when
youall was so dad burned tickled at gittin hit done Youall aint got
no right ter sling hit inter the river an anyway I aint agoin ter
let you

Which sounds very sensible to me came a clear voice from a few feet
distant

Judy and Brian turned quickly to face a young woman who stood regarding
them thoughtfully with a suggestion of a smile on her very attractive
face



CHAPTER XIV

BETTY JO CONSIDERS


The most careless eye would have seen instantly that the newcomer was
not a native of that backwoods district She was not a large woman but
there was nevertheless a full rounded strength which saved her
trim and rather slender body from appearing small Neither would a
discriminating observer describe her by that toocommon term pretty
She was more than that In her large gray eyes there was a look
of frank straightforward interest that suggested an almost boyish
goodfellowship while at the same time there was about her a general
air of good breeding with a calm selfpossessed and businesslike
alertness which combined with a wholesome dignity commanded a feeling
of respect and confidence Her voice was clear and musical with an
undertone of sympathetic humor One felt when she spoke that while she
lacked nothing of intelligent understanding and sympathetic interest
she was quite ready to laugh at you just the same

When the two stood speechless she said looking straight at Brian It
seems to me sir that the young lady has all the best of the argument
But I really think she should have some dry clothes as well

She turned to the dripping and dishevelled Judy You poor child Arent
you cold It is rather early in the season for a dip in the river I
should think Let me take whatever you have there and you make for the
house as fast as you can gothe run will warm you

As she spoke she went to the mountain girl holding out her hand to
take the manuscript and smiling encouragingly

But Judy backed away her stealthy oblique gaze fixed with watchful
surprise on the fair stranger

This here aint none of your putin and her shrill drawling monotone
contrasted strangely with the others pleasing voice Whered youall
happen from anyhow Howd youall git here

I came over the bluff by the path answered the other You see I
left the train from the south at Whites Crossing because I knew I could
drive up from there by the river road quicker than I could go by rail
away around through the hills to Thompsonville and then make the drive
down the river from there When I reached Elbow Rock I was in such a
hurry I took the short cut while the man with my trunk and things went
by the road over Schoolhouse Hill you know I arrived here just as this
gentleman was pulling you from the water

Before Brian could speak Judy returned with excitement I know who
youall be now I ought ter knowed the minute I set eyes on you Youall
are the gal with that there nocount name an youve come ter work for
him thereshe pointed to Brianahelpin him ter write his book
what aint hisn no more nohow cause he done throwed hit awayplumb
inter the river

I am Miss Williams returned the other My nocount name I
suppose is Betty Jo She laughed kindly Perhaps it wont seem so
nocount when we are better acquainted Judy Wont you run along to
the house and change to some dry clothes You will catch your death of
cold if you stand here like this

Howd youall know I was Judy

Why Auntie Sue wrote me about you of course

An you knowed me cause Im so all crooked an ugly I reckon came
the uncompromising return

Betty Jo turned to Brian You are Mr Burns are you not for whom I am
to work

Brian made no replyhe really could not speak And thisBetty
Jo included Judy the manuscript and the river in a graceful
gesturethis I suppose is the result of what is called the
artistic temperament

Still the man could find no words The young womans presence and her
reference to his work brought to him with overwhelming vividness the
memory of all to which he had so short a time before looked forward
and which was now so hopelessly lost to him He felt too a sense of
rebellion that she should have come at such a momentthat she could
stand there with such calm selfpossession and with such an air of
competency Her confidence and poise in such contrast to the chaotic
turmoil of his own thoughts and his utter helplessness in the situation
which had so suddenly burst upon him filled him with unreasoning
resentment

Betty Jo must have read in Brian Kents face something of the suffering
that held him there dumb and motionless before her and so sensed a
deeper tragedy than appeared on the surface of the incident and her own
face and voice revealed her understanding as she said with quiet
but decisive force Mr Burns Judy must go to the house Wont you
persuade her

Brian started as one aroused from deep abstraction and went to Judy
while Betty Jo drew a little way apart and stood looking out over the
river

Give me the manuscript Judy said Brian gently and go on to the
house

Youall aint agoin ter sling hit inter the river again The words
were halfquestion and halfassertion

No said Brian I promise not to throw it into the river again

As Judy gave him the manuscript she turned her beady eyes in a
stealthy oblique look toward Betty Jo and whispered Youall best
tell her bout hit I sure hate her poisonbad but hits easy ter see
shed sure know what ter do

Be careful that Auntie Sue doesnt see you like this Judy was
Brians only answer and Judy started off for her muchneeded change to
dry clothing

When the mountain girl was gone Brian stood looking at the
waterstained volume of manuscript in his hand He had no feeling now
of more than a curious idle interest in this work to which during the
months just past he had given so without reserve the best of himself
It was he thought strange how he could regard with such indifference a
thing for which a few hours before he would have given his life Dumbly
he was conscious of the truth of Judys wordsthat the book was no
longer his Judy was rightthis book which he had called his had always
been in reality Auntie Sues So the matter of his work at least
so far as he had to do with it was settleddefinitely and finally
settled

But what of himself What was to become of him Of one thing only he was
certain about himselfhe never could face Auntie Sue again Knowing
now what he had done and knowing that she knewthat all the time she
was nursing him back to health all the time she had been giving him the
inspiration and strength and peace of her gentle loving companionship
in the safe and quiet harbor of her little house by the river she had
known that it was he who hadA clear matteroffact but gentle
voice interrupted his bitter thoughts Is it so very badly damaged Mr
Burns

He had forgotten Betty Jo who now stood close beside him

Let me see She held out her hand as he turned slowly to face her

Without a word he gave her the manuscript

Very businesslike and practical but with an underlying feeling of
tenderness that was her most compelling charm Betty Jo examined the
waterstained volume

Why no she announced cheerfully it isnt really hurt much You
see the sheets being tied together so tightly the water didnt get all
the way through The covers and the first and last pages are pretty wet
and the edges of the rest are rather damp Itll be smudged somewhat
but I dont believe there is a single word that cant be made out It is
lucky it didnt prolong its bath though isnt it All we need to do
now is to put it in the sun to dry for a few minutes

Selecting a sunny spot near by she arranged the volume against a stone
and deftly separated the pages so that the air could circulate more
freely between them and one would have said from her manner of ready
assurance that she had learned from long experience exactly how to dry
a manuscript that had been thrown in the river and rescued just in the
nick of time That was Betty Jos way She always did everything without
hesitationjust as though she had spent the twentythree years of her
life doing exactly that particular thing

Kneeling over the manuscript and gently moving the wet sheets she
said without looking up Do you always bath your manuscripts like this
before you turn them over to your stenographer to type Mr Burns

In spite of his troubled state of mind Brian smiled

The clear matteroffact voice went on while the competent hands
moved the drying pages You see I never worked for an author before I
suspect I have a lot to learn

She looked up at him with a Betty Jo smile that went straight to his
heart as Betty Jos smiles had a curious way of doing

I hope you will be very patient with me Mr Burns You will wont
you There is no real danger of your throwing ME in the river when the
artistic temperament possesses you is there

It was no use When Betty Jo set out to make a man talk that man
talked Brian yielded not ungracefully I owe you an apology Miss
Williams he said

Indeed no Betty Jo returned giving her attention to the manuscript
again It is easy to see that you are terribly upset about something
and everybody is so accustomed to being upset in one way or another that
apologies for upsetments are quite an unnecessary bother arent they

That was another interestingly curious thing about Betty Jothe way
she could finish off a characteristic matteroffact statement with a
question which had the effect of making one agree instantly whether one
agreed or not

Brian felt himself quite unexpectedly feeling that upsetments were
quite common ordinary and to be expected events in ones life But I
am really in very serious trouble Miss Williams he said in a way that
sounded oddly to Brian himself as though he were trying to convince
himself that his trouble really was serious

Betty Jo rose to her feet and looked straight at him and there was no
mistaking the genuineness of the interest expressed in those big gray
eyes

Oh are you Is it really so serious I am so sorry But dont you
think you better tell me about it Mr Burns If I am to work for you I
may just as well begin right here dont you think

There it was againthat trickquestion Brian felt himself agreeing in
spite of himself though how he was to explain his painful situation
to this young woman whom until a few minutes before he had never even
seen he did not know He answered cautiously speaking half to himself
That is what Judy said

Betty Jo did not understand and made no pretenseshe never made a
pretense of anything What did Judy say she asked

That I had better tell you about it he answered

And the matteroffact Betty Jo returned Judy seems to be a very
particular and commonsensing sort of Judy doesnt she

And Brian realized all at once that Judy was exactly what Betty Jo said

ButIIdont see how I CAN tell you Miss Williams

Why laughed Betty Jo It is perfectly simple Mr Burns here
now Ill show you You are to sit down there on that nice comfortable
rockthat is your big officechair you knowand Ill sit right here
on this rockwhich is my little stenographychairand you will just
explain the serious business proposition to me with careful attention to
details I must tell you that detailing is one of my strong points so
dont spare me I really should have my notebook shouldnt I

Again in spite of himself Brian smiled also before he was aware
they were both seated as Betty Jo had directed

But this is not a business matter Miss Williams he managed to
protest halfheartedly

Betty Jo was looking at her watch in a most matteroffact manner and
she answered in a most matteroffact voice Everything is more or less
a business matter isnt it Mr Burns

And Brian if he had answered would have agreed

Betty Jo slipped her watch back into her pocket and continued You
will have plenty of time before that man with my trunk and things can
get away round over Schoolhouse Hill and down again to Auntie Sues He
will be obliged to stop at neighbor Toms and tell them all about me
of course We mustnt let him beat us to the house though so perhaps
you better begin dont you think

That dontyouthink so characteristic of Betty Jo did its work as
usual and so almost before Brian Kent realized what he was doing
it had been decided for him that to follow Judys advice was the best
possible thing he could do and he was relating his whole wretched
experience to this young woman about whom he knew nothing except that
she was a niece of an old pupil of Auntie Sues and that she had just
finished a course in a business college in Cincinnati

At several points in his story Betty Jo asked straightforward
questions or made short matteroffact comments but always with her
businesslike air of competent interest Indeed she managed to treat the
situation as being wholly impersonal while at the same time the man
was never for a moment made to feel that she was lacking in sincere and
genuine sympathy Only when he told her that his name was Brian Kent
and mentioned the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank did she for the
moment betray excited surprise When she saw that he had noticed she
said quickly I read of the affair in the papers of course

Auntie Sue had indeed taken a big chance when she decided for Betty Jo
to come to help Brian with his book But Auntie Sue had taken no chance
on Betty Jo herself Perhaps it was in fact the dear old teachers
certainty about Betty Jo herself that had led her to accept the risk
of sending for the niece of her friend and pupil under such a peculiar
combination of circumstances

When Brian had finished his story with the account of his discovery of
the distressing fact that he had robbed Auntie Sue and that she knew he
had robbed her Betty Jo said It is really a sad story isnt it Mr
Burns But oh isnt Auntie Sue wonderful Was there ever such
another woman in the world Dont you love her And couldnt you do
anythinganything that would make her happy After all when you think
of Auntie Sue and how wonderful she has been this whole thing isnt so
bad is it

Why IIdont think I see what you mean Brian replied puzzled
by the unexpected turn she had given to the situation yet convinced by
that little question with which she finished that she was somehow right

Well I mean wouldnt YOU love to do for some one what Auntie Sue has
done for you I should if I were only big enough and good enough
It seems to me it would make one the happiest and contentedest and
peacefulest person in the world wouldnt it

Brian did not answer While he felt himself agreeing with Betty Jos
view he was wondering at himself that he could discuss the matter
so calmly It was not that he no longer felt deeply the shame of this
terrible thing that he had done it was not that he had ceased to suffer
the torment that had caused his emotional madness which had found
expression in his attempt to destroy his manuscript it was only
that this young woman somehow made it possible for him to retain his
selfcontrol and instead of venting his emotions in violent and wholly
useless expressions of regret and selfcondemnation and in irrational
temperamental action to consider coolly and sanely what he must do He
was strangely possessed too of an instinctive certainty that Betty Jo
knew exactly how he felt and exactly what she was doing

While he was thinking these things or rather feeling them Betty Jo
went to see how the manuscript was drying She returned to her seat on
the rock presently saying It is doing very nicelyalmost dry I
think it will be done pretty soon In the meantime what are we going
to do about everything You have thought of something for you to do of
course

I fear I have felt rather more than I have thought returned Brian

She nodded Yes I know but feeling alone never arrives anywhere An
excess of thoughtless feeling is sheer emotional extravagance I sound
like a book dont I she laughed It is so just the same Mr
Burns And now that you haveahbeen properlynot to say
gloriouslyextravagant at poor Judys expense we had better do a
little thinking dont you think

The mans cheeks reddened at her words but the straightforward
downright sincerity of those gray eyes that looked so frankly into
his held him steady while the interrogation at the end of her remark
carried its usual conviction

There is only one possible thing left for me to do Miss Williams he
said earnestly

And what is that A smile that sent a glow of courage to Brian Kents
troubled heart accompanied the flat question

I cant face Auntie Sue again knowing what I know now He spoke with
passion

Of course you would expect to feel that way wouldnt you came the
matteroffact answer

The only thing I can do he continued is to give myself up and go
to the penitentiary arranging somehow to do it in such a way that the
reward will go to Auntie Sue God knows she deserves it Sheriff Knox
would help me fix that part I am sure

For a moment there was a suspicious moisture in Betty Jos gray eyes
Then she said And you would really go to prison for Auntie Sue

It is the least I can do for her now he returned

And Betty Jo must have felt the sincerity of his purpose for she said
softly I am sure that it would make Auntie Sue very happy to know that
you would do that andshe addedI know that you could not possibly
make her more unhappy and miserable than by doing it could you

Again she had given an unexpected turn to the subject with the usual
convincing questionmark

But what can I do he demanded letting himself go a little

Betty Jo steadied him with Well suppose you listen while I consider
Did I tell you that considering was another of my strong points Mr
Burns Well it is You may consider me while I consider if you please

The first thing is that you must make Auntie Sue happyas happy as
you possibly can do at any cost The second thing is that you must pay
her back that money every penny of it Now it wouldnt make her happy
for you to go to prison and the reward wouldnt pay back all the money
and if you were in prison you never could pay the rest besides if you
were wasting your time in prison she would just die of miserableness
and she wouldnt touch a penny of that rewardmoneynot if she was to
die for want of it So that settles that doesnt it

And Brian was forced to admit that as Betty Jo put it it did

Very well let us consider some more Dear Auntie Sue has been
wonderfully gloriously happy in doing what she has for you this past
wintermeaning your book and all I can see that she must have been
No one could help being happy doing such a thing as that So you just
simply cant spoil it all now by letting her know that you know what
you know

Brian started to speak but she checked him with Please Mr Burns
I must not be interrupted when I am considering Next to the
prisonwhich we have agreed wont do at allyou could do nothing
that would make Auntie Sue more unhappy than to spoil the happiness she
has in your not knowing what you have done to her That is very clear
isnt it And think of her miserableness if after all these weeks of
happy anticipation your book should never be published No no no you
cant rob Auntie Sue of her happiness in you just because you stole her
money can you

And Brian knew in his heart that she was right

So you see Betty Jo continued the only possible way to do is to
go right along just as if nothing had happened And there is this final
considerationwhich must be a dark secret between you and mewhen
the book is finished you must see to it that every penny that comes
from it goes to Auntie Sue until she is paid back all that she lost
through you Now isnt that pretty fine considering Mr Burns

And Brian was convinced that it was But he suggested the book may
not earn anything Nothing that I ever wrote before did

You never wrote one before just like this did you came the very
matteroffact answer And besides if your book never earns a cent
it will do Auntie Sue a world more good than your going to prison for
her That would be rather silly now that you think of it wouldnt it
And now that we have our conspiracy all nicely conspired we must hurry
to the house before that man arrives with my things

She went for the manuscript as she spoke See she cried it is quite
dry and not a bit the worse for its temperamental experience She
laughed gleefully

But Miss Williams exclaimed Brian IIcant understand you
You dont seem to mind What I have told you about myself doesnt seem
totomake any difference to youI mean in your attitude toward me

Oh yes it does she returned It makes me very interested in you
Mr Burns

But how can you have any confidenceHow can you help me with my book
now that you know what I am he persisted for he was sincerely puzzled
by her apparent indifference to the revelation he had made of his
character

Auntie Sueshe answeredjust Auntie Sue Comewe must go

How in the world can I ever face her groaned Brian

You wont get the chance at her for awhile with me aroundshe will
be so busy with me that she wont notice anything wrong with you So
you will get accustomed to the conspiracy feeling before you are even
suspected of conspiring You know when one has once arrived at the
state of not feeling like a liar one can lie with astonishing success
Havent you found it so

They laughed together over this as they went toward the house

As they reached the porch Betty Jo whispered a last word of
instruction You better find Judy and fix her the first thingfix
her good and hard Here is Auntie Sue now Dont worry about her
noticing anything strange about you Ill attend to her

And the next minute Betty Jo had the dear old lady in her arms



CHAPTER XV

A MATTER OF BUSINESS


The weeks that followed the coming of Betty Jo to the little log house
by the river passed quickly for Brian Kent Perhaps it was the peculiar
circumstances of their first meeting that made the man feel so strongly
that he had known her for many years instead of for only those few
short weeks That could easily have been the reason because the
young woman had stepped so suddenly into his life at a very critical
timewhen his mental faculties were so confused by the turmoil and
suffering of his emotional self that the past was to him at the moment
far more real than the present

And Betty Jo had not merely come into his life casually as a
disinterested spectator but by the peculiar appeal of herself she
had led Brian to take her so into his confidence that she had become
immediately a very real part of the experience through which he was then
passing and thus was identified with his past experience out of which
the crisis of the moment had come

Again Betty Jo in the naturalness of her manner toward him and by her
matteroffact impersonal consideration of his perplexing situation
had brought to his unsettled and chaotic mind a sense of stability and
order and by subtly insinuating her own practical decisions as to the
course he should follow had made herself a very literal part of his
inner life In fact Betty Jo knew Brian Kent more intimately at the
close of their first meeting than she could have known him after years
of acquaintanceship under the ordinary course of development

Brians consciousness of this would naturally cause him to feel toward
the young woman as though she had long been a part of his life Still
other causes might have contributed to the intimate companionship that
so quickly became to them both an established and takenforgranted
fact but the circumstances of their first meeting given of course
their peculiar individualities were really quite enough The fact
that it was springtime might also have had something to do with it

The morning after her arrival Betty Jo set to work typing the
manuscript Brian went to his work on the timbered hillside In the
evenings Brian worked over the typewitten pagesrevising correcting
perfectingand then as Betty Jo made the final copy for the printers
they went critically over the work together

So the hours flew past on busy wings and the days of the springtime
drew toward summer The tender green of the newborn leaves and grasses
changed to a stronger deeper tone The air which had been so filled
with the freshness and newness of bursting buds and rainblessed soil
and all the quickening life of tree and bush and plant now carried the
perfume of strongly growing thingsthe feel of maturing life

To Brian the voices of the river brought a fuller deeper message with
a subtle undertone of steady and enduring purpose

From the beginning Betty Jo established for herself the habit of
leaving her work at the typewriter in the afternoons and going for
a walk over the hills Quite incidentally at first her walks
occasionally led her by way of the clearing where Brian was at work
with his ax and it followed naturally that as the end of the day drew
near the two would go together down the mountainside to the evening
meal But long before the book was finished the little afternoon visit
and the walk together at the days close had become so established as a
custom that they both accepted it as a part of their days life and to
Brian at least it was an hour to which he looked forward as the most
delightful hour of the twentyfour As for Betty Jowell it was
really Betty Jo who established the custom and developed it to that
point where it was of such importance

Auntie Sue was too experienced from her lifelong study of boys and
girls not to observe the deepening of the friendship between the man and
the woman whom she had brought together But if the dear old lady felt
any twinges of an apprehensive conscience when she saw the pair day
after day coming down the mountainside through the long shadows of
the late afternoon she very promptly banished them and quite
consistently with what Brian called her River philosophy made no
attempt to separate these two life currents which for the time at
least seemed to be merging into one

And often as the three sat together on the porch after supper to watch
the sunsets or later in the evening as Auntie Sue sat with her sewing
while they were busy with their work and unobserving the dear old lady
would look at them with a little smile of tender meaning and into the
gentle eyes would come that faraway look that was born of the memories
that had so sweetened the long years of her life and of the hope and
dream of a joy unspeakable that awaited her beyond the sunset of her
day

In her long letter to Betty Jo asking the girl to come Auntie Sue had
told the young woman the main facts of Brians history as she knew them
omitting only the mans true name and the name of the bank She had even
mentioned her conviction that there had been a woman in his trouble But
Auntie Sue had not mentioned in her letter the money she had lost nor
did she now know that Brian had himself told Betty Jo at the time of
their first meeting

On the day that Betty Jo typed the last page and the book was ready for
the printers the young woman went earlier than usual to the clearing
where Brian was at work The sound of his ax reached her while she was
yet some distance away and guided her to the spot where he was chopping
a big white oak

Brian with his eyes fixed on the widening cut at the base of the tree
did not notice the girl who stood watching him She was smiling to
herself at his ignorance of her presence and in anticipation of the
moment when he should discover her and there was in her eyes a look of
wholesome womanly admiration for the man who swung his ax with such easy
strength In truth Brian Kent at his woodmans labor made a picture not
at all unattractive

Swiftly the cut in the treetrunk widened as the ax bit deeply at every
skilful stroke and the chips flew about the choppers feet The acrid
odor of the freshly cut oak mingled with the woodland perfume The
sun warmly flooded the clearing with its golden light and splashing
through the openings in the forest foliage formed pools of yellow
beauty amid the dark rich green of the shadowy undergrowth The air was
filled with the sense of life vital and real and strong and beautiful

And the young woman as she stood smiling there was keenly conscious
of it all Most of all perhaps Betty Jo was conscious of the man who
worked with such vigor at his manly task

Slowly accurately the bright ax sank deeper and deeper into the heart
of the tree The chips increased in scattered profusion And then as
Betty Jo watched the swinging ax cut through the last fibre of the
trees strength and the leafy top swayed gently toward its fall Almost
imperceptibly at first it moved while Betty Jo watched breathlessly
Brian swung his ax with increasing vigor now while the wood still
remaining cracked and snapped as the weight of the tree completed the
work of the chopper Faster and faster the towering mass of foliage
swung in a wide graceful arc toward the ground The man with the ax
stepped back his eyes fixed on the falling tree as with swiftly
increasing momentum its great weight swept swiftly downward to its
crashing end

Betty Jo clapped her hands in triumph and Brian turning saw her
standing there His face was flushed and glistening with perspiration
his broad chest heaved with the deep breathing gained by his exertion
and his eyes shone with the gladness of her presence

You are early today he cried Have you finished Is it actually
completed

All finished she returned and going to the fallen tree she put her
hands curiously on the trunk which lay a little higher than her waist
Help me up she commanded

Brian set his ax against the stump and laughingly lifted her to the
seat she desired Then he stood watching her face as she surveyed the
tangled mass of branches

It looks so strange from here doesnt it she said

Yes and I confess I dont like to see it that way he returned I
wish they didnt have to be cut I feel like a murdererevery one I
fall

She looked down into his eyes as she returned I know you must YOU
would of course But after all it has to be and I dont suppose the
tree minds so much do you

No I dont suppose it feels it much He laughed and throwing aside
his hat he ran his fingers through his tumbled hair for all the world
like a schoolboy confused by being caught in some sentimental situation
which he finds not only embarrassing but puzzling as well

I like you for feeling that way about it though Betty Jo confessed
with characteristic frankness And I am sure it must be a very good
thing for the world that every one is not so intensely practical that
they can chop down trees without a pang And that reminds me Speaking
of the practical now that the book is finished what are we going to do
with it

Send it to some publisher I suppose answered Brian soberly and
then when they have returned it send it to some other publisher

Have you any particular publisher to whom you will send it first she
asked

They are all alike so far as my experience goes he returned

I suppose it would be best if you could take your book East and
interview the publishers personally dont you think

Brian shook his head I am not sure that it would make any difference
and in any case I couldnt do it

I know said Betty Jo and that is what I wanted to get at Why dont
you appoint me your agent and let me take your book East and make the
publishing arrangements for you

Brian looked at her with such delighted surprise that Betty Jo smiled
back at him well pleased

Would you really do it he demanded as though he feared she was
jesting

You are sure that you dont mean COULD I do itshe
returnedsure you could trust me

To which Brian answered enthusiastically You could do anything If you
undertake the job of landing a publisher for my stuff it is as good as
done

Thank you she said jumping down from the treetrunk Now that we
have settled it let us go to the house and tell Auntie Sue and I will
start in the morning

As they went down the hill they discussed the matter further and
later at the house Brian took a moment when Auntie Sue was in her
room to hand an envelope to his assistant Your salary he said
hurriedly and expense money for the trip

Oh Betty Jos exclamation was one of surprise Then she said in
her most matteroffact businesslike tone Thank you I will render a
statement of my account but For once Betty Jo seemed at a loss for
words You dont mind if I askisis this money

Brians face was a study Yes he said it is really Auntie Sues
money but it is all I have and I cant return it to herwithout her
knowingso I

Betty Jo interrupted I understand It is all we can doforgive me

Brian Kent did not know that Betty Jo a few minutes later buried the
envelope he had given her deep in the bottom of her trunk without even
opening it

The next day Brian drove to Thompsonville with Betty Jo who took the
noon train for the East

The two were rather quiet as Old Prince jogged soberly along the
beautiful river road Only now and then did they exchange a few words of
the most commonplace observation

They were within sight of the little Ozark settlement when Brian said
earnestly I wish I could tell you Miss Williams just what your
coming to help me with this work has meant to me

It has meant a great deal to me too Mr Burns she returned
Then she added quickly I suppose the first real work one does after
finishing school always means more than any position following could
possibly mean dont you think Just like your book No matter how many
you may write in the future this will always mean more to you than any
one of them

Yes he said slowly This book will always mean more to me than all
the others I may write

For a moment their eyes met with unwavering frankness Then Betty Jo
turned her face away and Brian stiffened his shoulders and sat a
little straighter in the seat beside her That was all

Very brave they were at the depot purchasing Betty Jos ticket and
checking her trunk With brave commonplaces they said goodbye when the
train pulled in Bravely she waved at him from the open window of the
coach And bravely Brian stood there watching until the train rounded
the curve and disappeared from sight between the hills

The world through which Brian Kent drove that afternoon on his way back
to Auntie Sue and Judy in the little log house by the river was a very
dull and uninteresting world indeed All its brightness and its beauty
seemed suddenly to have vanished And as Old Prince jogged patiently
on his way sleepily content with thoughts of his evening meal of hay
and grain the mans mind was disturbed with thoughts which he dared not
own even to his innermost self

Circumstances to a man Auntie Sue had said always meant a woman
And Brian Kent while he never under any pressure would have admitted
it knew within his deepest self that it was a woman who had set him
adrift on the dark river that dreadful night when he had cursed the
world which he thought he was leaving forever

Circumstances in the person of Auntie Sue had saved him from
destruction and in the little log house by the river had brought
about his ReCreation

And then when that revelation of his crime toward Auntie Sue had
come and the labor of months with all that it implied of the enduring
salvation of himself and the happiness of Auntie Sue hung wavering in
the balance it was the Circumstances of Betty Jos coming that had
set him in the right current of action again

What waited for him around the next bend in the river Brian
wonderedcalm and peaceful waters with gently flowing currents or
the wild tumult of dangerous rapids wherein he would be forced to fight
for his very existence Would Betty Jo succeed as his agent to the
publishers If she did succeed in finding a publisher to accept
his book would the reading public receive his message And if
that followed what then When Betty Jos mission in the East was
accomplished she was to return to Auntie Sue for the summer Then

Old Prince of his own accord was turning in at the gate and Brian
awoke from his abstraction to see Auntie Sue and Judy waiting for him

All during the evening meal and while he sat with Auntie Sue on the
porch overlooking the river as their custom was Brian was preoccupied
and silent while his companion with the wisdom of her seventy years
did not force the conversation

It was the time of the full moon and when Auntie Sue at last bade him
goodnight Brian saying that the evening was too lovely to waste in
sleep remained on the porch For an hour perhaps he sat there alone
but his thoughts were not on the beauties of the scene that lay before
him in all its dreamy charm of shadowy hills and moonlit river He had
no ear for the soft voices of the night The gentle breeze carried to
him the low deeptoned roar of the crashing waters at Elbow Rock but
he did not hear Moved at last by a feeling of restless longing and the
certainty that only a sleepless bed awaited him in the house he left
the porch to stroll along the bank of the river



CHAPTER XVI

THE SECRET OF AUNTIE SUES LIFE


Brian Kent strolling along the bank of the river in the moonlight
and preoccupied with thoughts that were at the last more dreams than
thoughts was not far from the house when a sound from behind some
nearby bushes broke in upon his reveries A moment he listened Then
telling himself that it was some prowling animal or perhaps a bird
that his presence had disturbed he went on But he had gone only a few
feet farther when he was conscious of something stealthily following
him Stepping behind the trunk of a tree he waited watching Then he
saw a form moving toward him through the shadows of the bushes Another
moment and the form left the concealing shadow and in the bright
moonlight he recognized Judy

At first the mans feeling was that of annoyance He did not wish to be
disturbed at such a time by the presence of the mountain girl But
his habitual gentleness toward poor Judy together with a very natural
curiosity as to why she was following him at that time of the night
when he had supposed her in bed and asleep led him to greet her kindly
as he came from behind the tree Well Judy are you too out enjoying
the moonlight

The girl stopped suddenly and halfturned as if to run but at his
words stood still

What is it Judy he asked going to her What is the matter

Theres a heap the matter she answered regarding him with that sly
oblique look while Brian noticed a feeling of intense excitement in her
voice I dont know what youall are agoin ter think of me but
Im bound ter tell you just the sameseems like I got tereven if
youall was ter lick me for hit like pap used ter

Why Judy dear the puzzled man returned soothingly you know I
would never strike you no matter what you did Come sit down here on
this log and tell me about whatever it is that troubles you then you
can go back to sleep again

I aint awantin ter set down I aint been asleep Hit seems like
I cant never sleep no more She wrung her hands and turned her poor
twisted body about nervously then demanded with startling abruptness
When do youall low shell git back

The wondering Brian did not at first catch her meaning and she
continued with an impatient jerk of her head Hits that there gal
with the nocount name Betty Jo Im atalkin bout

Oh you mean Miss Williams Brian returned Why I suppose she
will be back in two or three weeks or a month perhaps I dont know
exactly Judy Why

Cause Im atellin youall not ter let her come back here ever came
the startling answer in a voice that was filled with menacing anger
Then before Brian could find a word to reply the mountain girl
continued with increasing excitement Youall dassnt let her come
back here nohow cause if you do Ill hurt her sure Youall
have been athinkin as how I was plumb blind I reckon but I seen
youevery evenin when shed pretend ter just go for a walk an

Judy Judy Brian broke the stream of the excited girls talk What

Youall knows dad burned well what Im ameanin she retorted with
increasing anger Im ameanin that youall are plumb lovin that

A dry sob choked the torrent of words for an instant but with a
savage effort she went on I know I aint nothin alongside of her
but youall aint agoin ter have her just the samenot if I have ter
kill her first You aint got no right ter have her nohow cause hits

causecause I just naturally cant stand hit ter see youuns
tergether Fore God Im atellin you trueIll sure hurt her

The girls voice raised to a pitch of frenzied excitement and
whirling she pointed to the river as she cried Look out there What
do youall reckon your fine Betty Jo lady would do if I was ter git
her ketched in them there rapids What do youall reckon the Elbow Rock
water would do ter her Ill tell you what hitd do Hit would smash an

ary thing whats makin you love her like youre adoin An where
would all her fine schoolin an smart talk an pretty ways be then Eh
She wouldnt be no better nor half as good as me Im atellin you
onct Elbow Rock got done with her

The poor creature finished in wild triumph then suddenly as though
spent with the very fury of her passion she turned from the river and
said dully Youd sure best not let her come back sir Fore God I
aint awantin ter do hit but hit seems like I cant help myself I
cant sleep for wantin ter fix hit sosos you just couldnt want

that there other woman nor anybodywhat kin care for you like Im
acarinthey just naturally couldnt care like me causecause
you see sir I aint got nobody elseaint no man but you ever even
been decent ter me I sure aint got nobody else

The distraught creatures sobs prevented further speech and she dropped
down on the ground weak and exhausted her poor twisted body shaking
and writhing with the emotion she could not voice

For a little while Brian Kent himself was as helpless as Judy He could
only stand dumbly staring at her as she crouched at his feet Then
very gently he lifted her from the ground and tried as best he could
to comfort her But he felt his words to be very shallow and inadequate
even though his own voice was trembling with emotion

Come Judy dear he said at last when she seemed to have in a
measure regained her selfcontrol Come You must go back to the house
child

Drawing away from his supporting arm she answered quietly I aint
no child no more Mr Burns Im sure a woman now Im just as much a
woman asasshe is if I be like what I am Im plumb sorry I had ter
do this but I just naturally couldnt help hit You aint got no call
ter be scared Ill do hit again

When they were nearing the house Judy stopped again and for a long
minute looked silently out over the moonlit river while Brian stood
watching her

Hit is pretty aint hit Mr Burns she said at last With the hills

But Judy apparently without hearing him continued Seems like I can

em ananthe next time youall writes er book Mr Burns I low
youall ought ter put in bout them there snags an things cause folks
sure got ter know bout em if they aint awantin ter git drowned

When Judy had gone into the house Brian again sat alone on the porch

An hour perhaps had passed when a voice behind him said Why Brian
are you still up I supposed you were in bed long ago

He turned to see Auntie Sue standing in the doorway

And what in the world are you prowling about for this time of the
night Brian retorted bringing a chair for her

I am prowling because I couldnt sleepthinking about you Brian
she answered

I fear that is the thing that is keeping me up too he returned
grimly

I know she said gently Sometimes ones self does keep one awake
Is itis it anything you care to tell me Would it help for me to
know

For some time he did not answer while the old teacher waited silently
At last he spoke slowly Auntie Sue what is the greatest wrong that
a woman can do

The greatest wrong a woman can do Brian is the greatest wrong that a
man can do

But what is it Auntie Sue he persisted

I think she answeredindeed I am quite surethat the greatest
wrong is for a woman to kill a mans faith in woman and for a man to
kill a womans faith in man

Brian Kent buried his face in his hands

Am I right dear asked the old gentlewoman after a little

And Brian Kent answered Yes Auntie Sue you are rightthat is the
greatest wrong

Again they were silent It was as though few words were needed between
the woman of seventy years and this man who out of some great trouble
had been so strangely brought to her by the river

Then the silveryhaired old teacher spoke again Brian have you ever
wondered that I am so alone in the world Have you ever asked yourself
why I never married

Yes Auntie Sue he answered I have wondered

Many people have she said with simple frankness ThenI am going
to tell you something dear boy that only two people in the world
beside myself ever knew and they are both dead many years now I am
going to tell you because I feelbecause I thinkthat perhaps
it may help you a little I too Brian had my dreams when I was a
girlmy dreams of happinesssuch as every true woman hopes forof
a home with all that home meansof a loverhusbandof little
ones who would call me motherand my dreams ended Brian on a
battlefield of the Civil War He went from me the very day we were
promised He never returned I have always felt that we were as truly
one as though the church had solemnized and the law had legalized our
union I promised that I would wait for him

And youyou have kept that promise You have been true to that
memory Brian Kent asked wonderingly

I have been true to him Brianall the years of my life I have been
true to him

Brian Kent bowed his head reverently

Rising the old gentlewoman went close to him and put her hands on his
shoulders Brian dear I have told you my secret because I thought
it might help you to know Oh my boymy boydontdont let
anythingdont let anyonekill your faith in womanhood No matter how
bitter your experience you can believe now that there are women who
can be faithful and true Surely you can believe it now Brianyou
must

And as he caught her hands in his and raised his face to whisper I do
believe Auntie Sue she stooped and kissed him

Then again Brian Kent was alone in the night with his thoughts

And the river swept steadily on its shining way through the moonlit
world to the distant sea



CHAPTER XVII

AN AWKWARD SITUATION


Frequent letters from Betty Jo informed Brian and Auntie Sue of that
practical and businesslike young womans negotiations with various
Eastern publishers until at last the matter was finally settled to
Betty Jos satisfaction

She had contracted with a wellknown firm for the publication of the
book The details were all arranged The work was to begin immediately
Betty Jo was returning to the little log house by the river

Brian drove to Thompsonville the morning she was to arrive and it
seemed to him that Old Prince had never jogged so leisurely along the
winding river road yet he was at the little mountain station nearly an
hour before the train was due

Those weeks had been very anxious weeks to Brian in spite of Auntie
Sues oftrepeated assurances that no publisher could fail to recognize
the value of his work And to be entirely truthful Brian himself
deep down in his heart felt a certainty that his work would receive
recognition But still he would argue with himself his feeling
of confidence might very well be due to the dear old gentlewomans
enthusiastic faith in him rather than in any merit in the book itself
and it was a wellestablished factto all unpublished writers at
leastthat publishers are a heartless folk and exceedingly loth to
extend a helpful hand to unrecognized genius however great the worth of
its offering He could scarcely believe the letters which announced the
good news It did not seem possible that this allimportant first step
toward the success which Auntie Sue so confidently predicted for his
book was now an accomplished fact

And now that Betty Jos mission was completed it seemed months ago that
he had said goodbye to her and had watched the train disappear between
the hills But when at last the long whistle echoing and reechoing from
the timbered mountainsides announced the coming of the train that was
bringing her back and the train itself a moment later burst into view
and with a rushing roar of steam and wheels and brakes came to a stop
at the depot platform and there was Betty Jo herself it seemed that it
was only yesterday that she had gone away

Very calm and selfpossessed and well poised was Betty Jo when
she stepped from the train to meet him She was very capable and
businesslike as she claimed her baggage and saw it safely in the spring
wagon But still there was a something in her mannera light in the
gray eyes perhaps or a quality in the clear voicethat meant worlds
more to the man than her simple statement that she was glad to see him
again Laughingly she refused to tell him about her trip as they rode
home saying that Auntie Sue must hear it all with him And so conscious
was the man of her presence there beside him that somehow the
prospective success or failure of his book did not so much matter after
all

In the excitement of the joyous meeting between Auntie Sue and Betty
Jo Judys stoical selfrepression was unnoticed The mountain girl went
about her part of the household work silently with apparent indifference
to the young womans presence But when after the late dinner was over
Auntie Sue and Brian listened to Betty Jos story Judy unobserved was
nearby so that no word of the conversation escaped her

Three times that night when all was still in the little log house by
the river the door of Judys room opened cautiously and the twisted
form of the mountain girl appeared Each time for a few minutes she
stood there in the moonlight that shone through the open window into the
quiet room listening listening then went stealthily to the door of
the room where Betty Jo was sleeping and each time she paused before
that closed door to look fearfully about the dimly lighted living room
Once she crept to Brians door and then to Auntie Sues and once she
silently put her hand on the latch of that door between her and Betty
Jo but each time she went stealthily back to her own room

Betty Jo awoke early that morning Outside her open window the
birds were singing and the sun which was just above the higher
mountaintops was flooding the world with its wealth of morning beauty
The music of the feathery chorus and the golden beauty of the light
that streamed through the window into her room with the fresh enticing
perfume of the balmy air were very alluring to the young woman just
returned from the cities stale and dingy atmosphere

Betty Jo decided instantly that she must go for a beforebreakfast walk
From the window as she dressed she saw Brian going to the barn with
the milkpail and heard him greet the waiting Bess and exchange a
cheery goodmorning with Old Prince who hailed his coming with a low
whinny

Quietly so as not to disturb Auntie Sue Betty Jo slipped from the
house and went down the gentle slope to the riverbank and strolled
along the margin of the stream toward Elbow Rockpausing sometimes to
look out over the water as her attention was drawn to some movement of
the river life or turning aside to pluck a wild flower that caught
her eye She had made her way thus leisurely twothirds of the distance
perhaps from the house to Elbow Rock bluff when Judy suddenly confronted
her The mountain girl came so unexpectedly from among the bushes that
Betty Jo who was stooping over a flower was startled

Judy she exclaimed Goodness child how you frightened me she
finished with a goodnatured laugh But as she noticed the mountain
girls appearance the laugh died on her lips and her face was grave
with puzzled concern

Poor Judys black hair was uncombed and dishevelled The sallow
oldyoung face was distorted with passion and the beady eyes glittered
with the light of an insane purpose

What is it Judy asked Betty Jo What in the world is the matter

Whatd youall come back for demanded Judy with sullen menace in
every word I done told him not ter let you Hit pears ter me youuns
ought ter have more sense

Alarmed at the girls manner Betty Jo thought to calm her by saying
gently Why Judy dear you are all excited and not a bit like
yourself Tell me what troubles you I came back because I love to be
here with Auntie Sue of course Why shouldnt I some if Auntie Sue
likes to have me

Youall are alyin returned Judy viciously But youall sure cant
fool me Youall come back cause hes here

A warm blush colored Betty Jos face

Judys voice raised shrilly as she saw the effect of her words

Youall knows dad burned well thats what you come back for But hit
aint agoin ter do you no good hit sure aint I done told him I
sure warned him whatd happen if he let you come back I heard youall
atalkin yesterday evenin all bout his book an what a great man that
there publisherfeller back East lows hes goin ter be An I kin see
now that youall has knowed hit from the start an thats why youall
been afixin ter git him away from me I done studied hit all out last
night but I sure aint agoin ter let you do hit

As she finished the mountain girl who had worked herself into a frenzy
of rage moved stealthily toward Betty Jo and her face with those
blazing black eyes and its frame of black unkempt hair and its
expression of insane fury was the face of a fiend

Betty Jo drew back frightened at the poor creatures wild and
threatening appearance

Judy she said sharply Judy What do you mean

With a snarling grin of malicious triumph Judy cried Scared aint
you You sure got reason ter be cause there aint nothin kin stop me
now Know what Im agoin ter do Im agoin ter put youall in the
river just like I told him an old Elbow Rock is agoin ter make
youall broken an twisted an ugly like what my pap made me Oh hitll
sure fix that there fine slim body of yourn an that there pretty face
what he likes ter look at so an them fine clothesll be all wet an
mussed an torn off you Youall sure will be alookin worsen what
I ever looked the next time he sees youyou with your nocount
halfgal and halfboy name

As the mountain girl with the quickness of a wild thing leaped upon
her Betty Jo screamedone piercing cry that ended in a choking gasp
as Judys hands found her throat

Brian who was still at the barn busy with the morning chores heard
With all his might he ran toward the spot from which the call came

Betty Jo fought desperately but strong as she was she could never
have endured against the vicious strength of the frenzied mountainbred
Judy who was slowly and surely forcing her toward the brink of the
riverbank against which the swift waters of the rapids swept with
terrific force

A moment more and Brian would have been too late Throwing Judy aside
he caught the exhausted Betty Jo in his arms and carrying her a little
back from the edge of the stream placed her gently on the ground

Betty Jo did not faint but she was too spent with her exertions to
speak though she managed to smile at him reassuringly and shook her
head when he asked if she was hurt

When Brian was assured that the girl was really unharmed he turned
angrily to face Judy But Judy had disappeared in the brush

Presently as Betty Jos breathing became normal she arranged her
disordered hair and dress and told Brian what the mountain girl had
said and this of course forced the man to relate his experience with
Judy that night when she had told him that Betty Jo must not come back

I suppose I should have warned you Miss Williams he finished but
the whole thing seemed to me so impossible I could not believe there
was any danger of the crazy creature actually attempting to carry out
her wild threat and besideswell you can see that it was rather
difficult for me to speak of it to you I am sorry he ended with
embarrassment

For a long moment the two looked at each other silently then Betty
Jos practical common sense came to the rescue It would have been
awkward for you to try to tell me wouldnt it Mr Burns And now that
it is all over and no harm done we must just forget it as quickly as
we can We wont ever mention it again will we

Certainly not he agreed heartily But I shall keep an eye on Miss
Judy in the future I can promise you

I doubt if we ever see her again returned Betty Jo thoughtfully I
dont see how she would dare go back to the house after this I expect
she will return to her father Poor thing But we must be careful not to
let Auntie Sue know Then smiling up at him she added It seems like
Auntie Sue is getting us into all sorts of conspiracies doesnt it
What DO you suppose we will be called upon to hide from her next

At Brians suggestion they went first to the barn where he quickly
finished his work Then carrying the full milkpail between them they
proceeded laughing and chatting to the house where Auntie Sue stood
in the doorway

The dear old lady smiled when she saw them coming so and returning
their cheery greeting happily added Have you children seen Judy
anywhere The child is not in her room and the fire is not even made in
the kitchenstove yet



CHAPTER XVIII

BETTY JO FACES HERSELF


All that day Auntie Sue wondered about Judy while Brian and Betty Jo
exhausted their inventive faculties in efforts to satisfy the dear old
lady with plausible reasons for the mountain girls disappearance

During the forenoon Brian canvassed the immediate neighborhood and
returned with the true information that Judy had stopped at the first
house below Elbow Rock for breakfast where she had told the people
that she was going back to her father because she was doggone tired of
working for them there city folks what was alivin at Auntie Sues

This was in a way satisfactory to Auntie Sue because it assured her
that the girl had met with no serious accident and because she knew very
well the mountainbred girls ability to take care of herself in the
hills But still the gentle mistress of the log house by the river was
troubled to think that Judy would leave her so without a word

Betty Jo was so occupied during the day by her efforts to relieve Auntie
Sue that she had but little time left for thought of herself or for
reflecting on the situation revealed in her encounter with Judy But
many times during the day the mountain girls passionate accusation came
back to her Youall are alyin Youall come back cause HE is here
Nor could she banish from her memory the look that was on Brian Kents
face that morning when he was carrying her in his arms back from the
brink of the riverbank over which the frenzied Judy had so nearly sent
her to her death And so when the day at last was over and she was
alone in her room it was not strange that Betty Jo should face herself
squarely with several definite and pointed and exceedingly personal
questions

It was like Betty Jo to be honest with herself and to demand of herself
that her problems be met squarely

First of all Betty Jo she demanded in her downright
straightforward way of going most directly to the heart of a matter
are you in love with Brian Kent

Without hesitation the answer came I have not permitted myself to
love him

You have not permitted yourself to love him That means that you would
be in love with him if you dared doesnt it

And Betty Jo in the safe seclusion of her room felt her cheeks burn as
she acknowledged the truth of the deduction

The next question was inevitable Is Brian Kent in love with you Betty
Jo

And Betty Jo recalling many many things was compelled to answer from
the triumphant gladness of her heart He is trying not to be but he
cant help himself Andthe downright and straightforward young woman
continuedbecause I know that Brian Kent is trying so hard not to love
me is the real reason why I have not permitted myself to love him

But the clearthinking practical Betty Jo protested quickly You must
remember that you are wholly ignorant of Brian Kents history except
for the things he has chosen to tell you And those things in his life
which he has confessed to you are certainly not the things that could
win the love of a girl like you even though they might arouse your
interest in the man Interest is not love Betty Jo Are you quite sure
that you are not making the mistake that is most commonly made by young
women

Betty Jo was compelled to answer that she was not mistaking interest
for love because had such been the case she would not be able to so
analyze the situation Betty Jos quite womanly prejudice is admitted
because the prejudice was so womanly and because Betty Jo herself was
so womanly

Very well Miss Betty Jo the young woman continued inexorably you
are not permitting yourself to love Brian Kent because Brian Kent is
trying not to love you But why is the man trying so hard not to love
you

Betty Jo thought very hard over this question and felt her way
carefully to the answer It might be of course that it is because he
is a fugitive from the law A man under such circumstances could easily
convince himself that no good woman would permit herself to love him
and he would therefore in reasonable selfdefense prevent himself from
loving her if he could

But surely Brian Kent had every reason to know that Betty Jo did not at
all regard him as a criminal Betty Jo as Auntie Sue recognized only
the recreated Brian Kent If that were all they need only wait for the
restitution which was so sure to come through his book And Brian Kent
himself through Auntie Sues teaching and through his work had come
to recognize only his real self and not the creature of circumstances
which the river had brought to the little log house Betty Jo felt sure
that there was more than this that was forcing the man to defend himself
against his love for her Thus she was driven to the conclusion that
there was something in Brian Kents history that he had not made
known to hera something that denied him the right to love her and
thatreasoned poor Betty Jo in the darkness of her roomcould only
be a womana woman to whom he was bound not by love indeedBetty Jo
could not believe thatbut by ties of honor and of the law

And very clearly Betty Jo reasoned too that Brians attitude toward
her evidenced unmistakably his high sense of honor The very fact
that he had so persistentlyin all their companionship in their most
intimate moments together evenheld this invisible and to her unknown
barrier between them convinced her beyond a doubt of the essential
integrity of his character and compelled her admiration and confidence

That is exactly it Betty Jo she told herself sadly you love him
because he tries so hard to keep himself from loving you

And thus Betty Jo proved the correctness of Auntie Sues loving estimate
of her character and justified the dear old teachers faith in the
sterling quality of her womanhood

Face to face with herself fairly and squarely the girl accepted the
truth of the situation for Brian and for herself and determined her
course She must go awayshe must go at once

She wished that she had not returned to the log house by the river
She had never fully admitted to herself the truth of her feeling toward
Brian until Judy had so unexpectedly precipitated the crisis but she
knew now that Judy was right and that the real reason for her return
was her love for him She knew as well that her very lovewhich
once fully admitted and recognized by her demanded with all the
strength of her young womanhood the nearness and companionship of the
mate her heart had chosendemanded also that she help him to keep
that fine sense of honor and true nobility of character which had won
her

She understood instinctively thatnow that she had confessed her love
to herselfshe would in spite of herself tempt him in a thousand
ways to throw aside that barrier which he had so honorably maintained
between them Her heart would plead with him to disregard his better
self and come to her Her very craving for the open assurance of his
love would tempt him perhaps beyond his strength And yet she knew as
truly that if he should yield if he should cast aside the barrier
of his honor if he should deny his best self and answer her call it
would be disastrous beyond measure to them both

To save the fineness of their love Betty Jo must go If it should be
that they never met again still she must go

But there were other currents moving in the river that night In the
steady onward flow of the whole Betty Jos lifecurrents seemed to be
setting away from the man she loved But other currents unknown to the
girl who faced herself so honestly and who so bravely accepted the
truth she found were moving in ways beyond her knowledge Directed and
influenced by innumerable and unseen forces and obstacles the currents
which combined made the stream of life in its entirety were weaving
themselves togetherinterlacing and separatingdrawing close and
pulling apartonly to mingle as one again

Betty Jo saw only Brian Kent and herself and their love which she now
acknowledged and she had as it were only a momentary glimpse of those
small parts of the stream

Betty Jo could not know of those other currents that were moving so
mysteriously about her as the river poured itself onward so unceasingly
to the sea



CHAPTER XIX

JUDYS CONFESSION


In spite of all their care Brian and Betty Jo did not wholly convince
Auntie Sue that there was no more in Judys disappearance than the
report from the neighbors indicated The dear old lady felt that there
was something known to the young people that they were keeping from her
and while she did not question their motives and certainly did not
worryfor Auntie Sue never worriedshe was not satisfied with the
situation When she retired to her room for the night she told herself
with some spirit that she would surely go to the bottom of the affair
the next morning

It happened that Auntie Sue went to the bottom of the affair much sooner
than she expected

It must have been about that same hour of the night when Betty Jo after
reaching her decision to go away retired to her bed that Auntie Sue
was aroused by a low knocking at the open window of her room

The old teacher listened without moving her first thought being that
her fancy was tricking her The sound came again and this time there
could be no mistake Sitting up in her bed Auntie Sue looked toward
the window and at the sound of her movement a low whisper came from
without

Dont be scared Auntie Sue Hit aint nobody but just me

As she recognized Judys voice she saw the mountain girls head and
twisted shoulders outlined above the windowsill A moment more and
Auntie Sue was at the window

Shhh cautioned Judy Dont wake em up I just naturally got ter
tell youall somethin Auntie Sue but I aint awantin Mr Burns
an that there Betty Jo woman ter hear I reckon I best come through the
winder

Acting upon the word she climbed carefully into the room

Judy child What

The mountain girl interrupted Auntie Sues tremulous whisper with Ill
tell hit ter you mam in a little bit if youll just wait I got ter
see if they are sure nough asleepin first though

She stole silently from the room to return a few minutes later They
are plumb asleep both of em she said in a low tone when she had
cautiously closed the door I done opened the doors ter their rooms
an listened an shet em again thout ary one of em amovin even
Ill fix the winder now an then we kin make a light

Carefully she closed the window and drew down the shade Then she lit
the lamp

Auntie Sue who was sitting on the bed looked at the girl in bewildered
amazement

With a nervous laugh Judy fingered her torn dress and dishevelled hair
I sure am a sight aint I mam I done hit acomin through the bresh
in the dark But dontdontlook so kinder lost like youall aint
got no call ter be scared of me

Why Judy dear Im not afraid of you Come child tell me what is
the trouble

At the kindly manner and voice of the old gentlewoman those black eyes
filled with tears which for the moment the mountain girl stoically
permitted to roll down her thin sallow cheeks unheeded Then with
a quick resolute jerk of her twisted body she drew her dress sleeve
across her face and said IIreckon I couldnt hate myself no
worsen Im adoin Hit seems like I been mighty nigh plumb crazy but
I just naturally had ter come back an tell youall cause youall been
so good ter me

She placed a chair for Auntie Sue and added Youall best make
yourself comfertable though mam Im mighty nigh tuckered out myself
Hits a right smart way from where paps alivin ter here an I done
come in a hurry

She dropped down on the floor her back against the bed and clasped her
knees in her hands as Auntie Sue seated herself

Begin at the beginning Judy and tell me exactly what has happened
said Auntie Sue

Yes mam I willthats what I was aimin ter do when I made up ter
come back

And she did Starting with her observation of Brian and Betty Jo and
her conviction of their love she told of her interview with Brian the
night she warned him not to let Betty Jo return and finished with the
account of her attack on Betty Jo that morning

Auntie Sue listened with amazement and pity Here indeed was a wayward
and troubled lifecurrent

But Judy Judy exclaimed the gentle old teacher you would not
really have pushed Betty Jo into the river She would have been drowned
child Surely you did not mean to kill her Judy

The girl wrung her hands and her deformed body swayed to and fro in the
nervous intensity of her emotions But she answered stubbornly That
there was just what I was aimin ter do Id akilled her sure if Mr
Burns hadnt acome just when he did I cant rightly tell how hit was
but hit seemed like there was somethin inside of me what was amakin
me do hit an I couldnt somehow help myself Ananthat aint
all mam I done worsen that she continued in a low moaning wail
Oh my GodAmighty Why didnt Mr Burns sling me inter the river an
let me be smashed an drowned at Elbow Rock while he had me stead of
lettin me git away ter do what Ive gone an done

Auntie Sues wonderful native strength enabled her to speak calmly
What is it you have done Judy You must tell me child

The older womans voice and manner steadied the girl and she answered
more in her usual colorless monotone but still guarded so as not to
awaken the other members of the household Hit seemed like Mr Burns
ketchin me like he did an me aseein him with her in his arms made
me plumb crazymad an I lowed Id fix hit sos he couldnt never have
her nohow so IIdone told pap bout him bein Brian Kent what
had robbed that there bank an how there was er lot of rewardmoney
awaitin for anybody thatd tell on him

Auntie Sue was too shocked to speak Was it possible that now when the
real Brian Kent was so far removed from the wretched bank clerk when
his fine natural character and genius had become so established and his
book wasNo no It could not be God could not let men be so cruel as
to send Auntie Sues Brian Kent to prison because that other Brian Kent
tormented by wrong environment and driven by an evil combination of
circumstances had taken a few dollars of the banks money And Betty
JoNo no Auntie Sues heart cried out in protest There must be some
way She would find some way The bankerHomer Ward Auntie Sues mind
alert and vigorous as the mind of a woman of half her years caught at
the thought of her old friend and pupil She leaned forward in her chair
over the girl who sat on the floor at her feet and her voice was strong
and clear with the strength of the spirit which dominated her frail
body

Judy did you tell any one else besides your father

There wasnt nobody else ter tell came the answer An pap he
lowed hed kill me if I said anythin ter anybody fore hed got the
money He aims ter git hit all for hisself

What will he do Will he go to Sheriff Knox

No mam pap he lowed if he done that away the Sheriff hed
take most of the money Paps agoin right ter that there bank feller

Yes yes Go on Judy

You see mam I done remembered the name of the bank an where hit was
an Mr Wards name an all on count of that there money letter what

railroad you see whatll let him have money enough for the tripa

out ter fix hit some way soMr Burns wont have ter go ter prison
Couldnt youall sendsend a telegraph ter the bank man er somethin
Id git it inter Thompsonville for you mam an Mr Burns he neednt
never know nothin bout hit

Auntie Sue was dressing when Judy finished speaking With a physical
strength that had its source in her indomitable spirit she moved about
the room making the preparations necessary to her plan and as she
worked she talked to the girl

No Judy a telegram wont do I must go to Homer Ward myself That
morning train leaves Thompsonville at six oclock You must slip out of
the house and harness Old Prince to the buggy as fast as you can You
will drive with me to Thompsonville and bring Prince back You can
turn him loose when you get near home and he will come the rest of the
way alone You must not let Mr Burns nor Betty Jo see you because
they mustnt know anything about what you have done Do you understand
child

Yes mam said Judy eagerly She was on her feet now

You can go to the neighbors and find some place to stay until I
return continued Auntie Sue

You dont need ter worry none bout me said Judy I kin take care
of myself I reckon But aint you plumb seared ter go way on the cars
alone an you so old

Old retorted Auntie Sue I have not felt so strong for twenty years
There is nothing for me to fear I will be in St Louis tomorrow night
and in Chicago the next forenoon I guess I am not so helpless that I
cant make a little journey like this Homer Ward shall never send my
boy to prisonneverbank or no bank Go on now and get Prince
and the buggy ready We must not miss that train She pushed Judy from
the room and again cautioned her not to awaken Brian or Betty Jo

When she had completed her preparations for the trip Auntie Sue wrote
a short note to Betty Jo telling her that she had been called away
suddenly and that she would return in a few days and that she
was obliged to borrow Betty Jos pocketbook Grave as she felt the
situation to be Auntie Sue laughed to herself as she pictured the
consternation of Betty Jo and Brian in the morning

Silently the old lady stole into the girls room to secure the money
she needed and to leave her letter Then as silently she left the
house and found Judy who was waiting with Old Prince and the buggy
ready to start

The station agent at Thompsonville was not a little astonished when
Auntie Sue and Judy appeared and with the easy familiarity of an old
acquaintance greeted her with Howdy Auntie Sue What in thunder are
you doin out this time of the day No bad news I hope

Oh no Mr Jackson Auntie Sue answered easily Im just going to
Chicago for a little visit with an old friend

Sort of a vacation eh returned the man behind the window as he
made out her ticket Well you sure have earned one Auntie Sue Its
gittin to be vacation time now too Bunch of folks come in yesterday
to stay at the clubhouse for a spell Pretty wild lot Id saywimmen
as well as the men I reckon them clubhouse parties dont disturb you
much though if you be their nearest neighbordo they

They never have yet Mr Jackson she returned Their place is on the
other side of the river and a mile above my house you know I see them
in their boats on The Bend though and once in a while they call on me
But the Elbow Rock rapids begin in front of my place and the clubhouse
people dont usually come that far down the river

She turned to Judy and with the girl went out of the waiting room
to the platform where she whispered You must start back right away
Judy If your father is on the train he might see you

What if pap ketches sight of youall Judy returned nervously

He will not be so apt to notice me as he would you she returned
even if he does catch a glimpse of me And it cant be helped if he
does Ill be in Chicago as quick as he will and I know I will see Mr
Ward first Go on now dear and dont let Mr Burns or Betty Jo see
you and be a good girl I feel sure that everything will be all right

With a sudden awkward movement poor Judy caught the old gentlewomans
hand and pressed it to her lips then turning ran toward the buggy

When the train arrived the station agent came to help Auntie Sue with
her handbag aboard and she managed to keep her friend between herself
and the coaches in case Jap Taylor should be looking from a window As
the conductor and the agent assisted her up the steps the agent said
Mind you take good care of her Bill Finest old lady GodAlmighty
ever made If you was to let anything happen to her you best never show
yourself in this neighborhood again wed lynch you sure

The conductor found a good seat for his lovely old passenger and made
her as comfortable as possible As he punched her ticket he said with
a genial smile which was the voluntary tribute paid to Auntie Sue by
all men You are not much like the passengers I usually carry in this
part of the country mam They are mostly a rather roughlookin lot

She smiled back at him understanding perfectly his intended compliment
They are good people though sirmost of them Of course there are
some who are a little wild sometimes I expect

The railroad man laughed again shaking his head I should say so You
ought to see the specimen Ive got in the smoker I picked him up back
there at Gardner Perhaps you have heard of himJap Taylor He is about
the worst in the whole country I reckon

I have heard of him she returned I do hope he wont come into this
coach

Oh he wont start anything on my train laughed the man in blue
reassuringly He would never come in here anyhow Them kind always
stay in the smoker Seems like they know where they belong He is
halfscared to death himself anyway he is going to Chicago too and
Ill bet its the first time in his life he has ever been farther from
these hills than Springfield



CHAPTER XX

BRIAN AND BETTY JO KEEP HOUSE


When Brian went to the barn the next morning he found Old Prince
standing at the gate While he was still trying to find some plausible
explanation of the strange incident after unharnessing the horse and
giving him his morning feed an excited call from Betty Jo drew his
attention With an answering shout he started for the house The
excited girl met him halfway and gave him Auntie Sues note

When Brian had read the brief and wholly inadequate message they stood
looking at each other too mystified for speech Brian read the note
again aloud speaking every word with slow distinctness Well Ill
be hanged he ejaculated at the close of the remarkable communication
staring at Betty Jo

It wouldnt in the least surprise me if we were both hanged before
night returned Betty Jo After this from Auntie Sue I am prepared
for anything What on earth DO you suppose has happened

Brian shook his head It is too much for me

Together they went to the house and the place seemed strangely
deserted Every possible explanation that suggested itself they
discussed and rejected

One thing we can depend upon said Brian at last when they had
exhausted the resources of their combined imaginations Auntie Sue
knows exactly what she is doing and she is doing exactly the right
thing I suppose we will know all about it when she returns

Betty Jo looked again at the note I will be back in a few days she
read slowly Be good children and take care of things

Again they regarded each other wonderingly

Then Betty Jo broke the silence with an odd little laugh I feel like
we were cast away on some desert island dont you

Something like that Brian returned Then to relieve the strain of
the situation he added I suppose Bess will have to be milked and
the chores finished just the same

And Ill get breakfast for us agreed Betty Jo as he started back to
the barn

In the safe seclusion of the stable with no one but Old Prince and
Bess to witness his agitation Brian endeavored to bring his confused
and unruly thoughts under some sort of control

Several days several days The words repeated themselves with
annoying persistency And theyBetty Jo and he Brian Kentwere to
take care of thingsthey were to keep house togetherthey were to
live together alonein the log house by the riveralone She was
even then preparing their breakfast They would sit down at the table
alone And there would be dinner and supper and the eveningjust for
them He would work about the place She would attend to her household
duties He would go to his meals and she would be there expecting
himwaiting for him And when the tasks of the day were finished they
would sit on the porch to watch the coming of the nightBetty Jo
and he Brian KentWhat in Gods name the man demanded of the
indifferent Bess did Auntie Sue mean by placing him in such a
situation Did she think him more than human

It had not been easy for Brian to maintain that barrier between himself
and Betty Jo even with the constant help of Auntie Sues presence
Many many times he had barely saved himself from declaring his
love and now he was asked to live with her in the most intimate
companionship possible

For the only time in his life Brian Kent was almost angry at Auntie Sue
By all that was consistent and reasonable and merciful and safe he
told himself if it was absolutely necessary for the dear old lady to
disappear so mysteriously why had she not taken Betty Jo along

In the meantime while Brian was confiding his grievances to his
fourfooted companions in the barn Betty Jo was expressing herself in
the kitchen

Betty Jo she began as she raked the ashes from the stove preparatory
to building the fire it appears to me that you have some serious
considering to do andwith a glance toward the barn as she went out
to empty the ashpanyou must do it quickly before that man comes for
his breakfast You were very right last night in your decision to
go away It is exactly what you should have done I am more than ever
convinced of that this morning But you cant go now Even if Auntie
Sue had not taken your pocketbook and every penny in it you couldnt
run away with Auntie Sue herself gone If she hadnt wanted you to stay
right here for some very serious reason Betty Jo she would have
taken you with her last night Auntie Sue very pointedly and definitely
expects you to be here when she returns And she will be away several
daysseveral days Betty Jo She repeated the words in a whisper
And during those several days you are to keep house for the man you
lovethe man who loves youthe man whom you must keep from telling
you his loveno matter how your heart pleads for him to tell you you
must not permit him to speak He will be coming in to breakfast in a few
minutes and you will sit down at the table with himacross the table
from himfacing himBetty Jojust like

She looked in the little mirror that hung beside the kitchen window
and with dismay saw her face flushed with color that was not caused by
the heat of the stove And you will be forced to look at him across the
table and he will look at youandand you must not she stamped
her footyou dare not look like THAT Betty Jo

And then there will be the dinner that you will cook for him and the
supper and the evenings on the porch O Lord Betty Jo what ever will
you do How will you ever save the fineness of your love If you were
afraid to trust yourself with the help of Auntie Sues presence what
in the world can you do without herand you actually keeping house
with him Oh Auntie Sue Auntie Sue she groaned you are the dearest
woman in the world and the best and wisest but you have blundered
terribly this time Why DID you do such a thing It is not fair to him
It is not fair to me It is not fair to our love

All of whichthe practical Betty Jo declared a moment later wiping
her eyes on the corner of her apron and going into the other room to
set the table for breakfastall of which Betty Jo does not in the
least help matters and only makes you more nervous and upset than you
are

One thing is certain sure she continued while her hands were busy
with the dishes and the table preparations If we can endure this test
we need never never never fear that anything nor anybody can ever
ever make us doubt the genuineness of our love Auntie Sue has certainly
arranged it most beautifully for Brian Kent and Betty Jo Williams to
become thoroughly acquainted

Betty Jo suddenly paused in her work and stood very still I wonder
she said slowlycan it beis it possiblewhat if Auntie Sue has
brought about this situation for that very reason

Breakfast ready cried Brian at the kitchendoor and his voice was so
hearty and natural that the girl answered as naturally It will be
as soon as you are ready for it I forget do you like your eggs three
minutes or four

They really managed that breakfast very well even if they did sit
opposite each other so that each was forced to look straight across
the table into the face of the other Or perhaps it was because they
looked at each other so straight and square and frankly honest that the
breakfast went so well

And because the breakfast went so well they managed the dinner and the
supper also

I have been thinking said Brian at the close of their evening meal
looking straight into the gray eyes over the table perhaps it might be
better for you to stay at neighbor Toms until Auntie Sue returns Ill
hitch up Old Prince and drive you over if you say Or we might find
some neighbor woman to come here to live with us if you prefer

You dont like my housekeeping then asked Betty Jo

Like it exclaimed Brian and the tone of his voice approached the
dangerpoint

Betty Jo said quickly Ill tell you exactly what I think Mr Burns
Auntie Sue said we were to be good children and take care of things
until she returned She did not say for me to shirk my part by going to
neighbor Toms or by having any one come here Dont you think we can do
exactly what Auntie Sue said

Yes returned Brian heartily I am sure we can And do you
knowcome to think about itI believe the dear old lady would be
disappointed in us both if we dodged ourwell he finished with
emphasisour responsibilities

And after that somehow the evening on the porch went as well as the
breakfast and dinner and supper had gone

It was the second day of their housekeeping that Betty Jo noticed
smoke coming from the stone chimney of the clubhouse up the river She
reported her observation to Brian when he came in from his work for
dinner During the afternoon they both saw boats on the quiet waters of
The Bend and at supper told each other what they had seen And in the
evening they together watched the twinkling lights of the clubhouse
windows and once they heard voices and laughter from somewhere on the
river as though a boating party were making merry

Two days later Brian and Betty Jo were just finishing dinner when a
step sounded on the porch and a man appeared in the open doorway

The stranger was dressed in the weird and flashy costume considered by
his class to be the proper thing for an outing in the country and his
face betrayed the sad fact that while he was mentally spiritually and
physically greatly in need of a change from the unclean atmosphere
that had made him what he was he was incapable of benefiting by more
wholesome conditions of living He was in fact a perfect specimen of
that type of clubman who in order to enjoy fully the beautiful life of
Gods unspoiled world must needs take with him all of the sordid and
vicious life of that world wherein he is most at home

With no word of greeting he said with that superior air which so many
city folk assume when addressing those who live in the country Have
you people any fresh vegetables or eggs to sell

Brian and Betty Jo arose and Brian stepping forward said with a
smile No we have nothing to sell here but I think our neighbor Mr
Warden just over the hill would be glad to supply you Wont you come
in

The man stared at Brian turned an appraising eye on Betty Jo then
looked curiously about the room

I beg your pardon he said removing his cap I thought when I
spoke that you were natives My name is GreenHarry Green There is
a party of us stopping at the clubhouse up the river therejust out
for a bit of a good time you know We are from St Louisfirst time
any of us were ever in the Ozarksfriends of mine own the clubhouse

My name is Burns returned Brian We noticed your boats on the river
You are enjoying your outing are you

Again the man looked curiously from Brian to Betty Jo Oh yes we
can stand it for awhile he answered Were a pretty jolly bunch you
seeknow how to keep things going It would kill me if I had to live
here in this lonesome hole very long though Dont you find it rather
slow Mrs Burns

Poor Betty Jos face turned fairly crimson She could neither answer the
stranger nor meet his gaze but stood with downcast eyesthen looked
at Brian appealingly

But Brian was as embarrassed as Betty Jo while the stranger as he
regarded them smiled with an expression of insolent understanding

I guess I have made another mistake he said with a meaning laugh

You have returned Brian sharply stepping forward as he spoke for
the mans manner was unmistakable Be careful sir that you do not
make another

Mr Green spoke quickly with an airy wave of his hand No offense
no offense I assure you Then as he moved toward the door he added
still with thinly veiled insolence I beg your pardon for intruding I
understand perfectly Goodafternoon Mr Burns Goodafternoon miss

Brian followed him out to the porch and the caller as he went down the
steps turned back with another understanding laugh I say Burns you
are a lucky devil Dont worry about me old man I envy you by Jove
Charming little nest Come over to the club some evening Bring the
little girl along and help us to have a good time Solong

Mr Harry Green probably never knew how narrowly he escaped being
manhandled by the enraged but helpless Brian

Brian remained on the porch until he saw the man in his boat leave the
eddy at the foot of the garden and row away up the river

In the house again the two faced each other in dismay

Betty Jo was first to recover I am sure that it is quite time for
Auntie Sue to come home and take charge of her own household again
Dont you think so Mr Burns

And Brian Kent most heartily agreed



CHAPTER XXI

THE WOMAN AT THE WINDOW


The members of the clubhouse party were amusing themselves that
afternoon in the various ways peculiar to their kind

At one end of the wide veranda overlooking the river a group sat at a
card table At the other end of the roomy lounging place men and women
lying at careless ease in steamerchairs and hammocks were smoking and
chatting about such things as are of interest only to that strange
class who are educated to make idleness the chief aim and end of their
existence On the broad steps leading down to the treeshaded lawn
which sloped gently to the boat landing at the rivers edge still
other members of the company were scattered in characteristic attitudes
Across the river in the shade of the cottonwoods that overhang the
bank a man and a woman in a boat were ostensibly fishing In a hammock
strung between two trees a little way from the veranda lay a woman
reading

Now and then a burst of shrill laughter broke the quiet of the
surrounding forest A man on the steps called a loud suggestive jest to
the pair in the boat and the woman waved her handkerchief in answer
The cardplayers argued and laughed over a point in their game Some
one shouted into the house for Jim and a negro man in white jacket
appeared When the people on the veranda had expressed their individual
tastes the one who had summoned the servant called to the woman in the
hammock under the tree What is yours Martha

Without looking up from her book the woman waved her hand and
answered I am not drinking this time Thanks

A chorus of derisive shouts and laughter came from the veranda But
the woman went on reading Oh let her alone protested some one
goodnaturedly She was going a little strong last night Shell be
all right by and by when she gets started again

The negro Jim had returned with his loaded tray and was passing among
the members of the company with his assortment of glasses when some one
called attention to Harry Green who was just pulling his boat up to the
landing after his visit to the little log house down the river

A boisterous chorus greeted the boatman Hello Harry Did you find
anything Youre just in time Whatll you have

With a wave of greeting the man fastened his boat to the landing and
started up the slope

Hell have a Scotch of course said some one Did anybody ever know
him to take anything else Go and get it Jim Hell be nearly dead for
a drink after rowing all that distance

The woman in the hammock lowered her book and lay watching the man as
he came up the path toward the steps

Harry Green who apparently was a person of importance among them
seated himself in an easy chair on the veranda and accepted the glass
proffered by Jim

Did you find any eggs Harry demanded one The man first refreshed
himself with a long drink then looked around with a grin of amused
appreciation I didnt get any eggs he said but I found the nest
all right

A shout of laughter greeted the reply

What sort of nest Harry Duck Turkey Hen Dove Or rooster came
from different members of the chorus

Raising his glass as though offering a toast he answered Love my
children love

A yell of delight came from the company accompanied by a volley of
A lovenest Well what do you know about that Good boy Harry Takes
Harry to find a lovenest Hes the boy to send for eggs I should say
yes Martha will like that Oh wont she

This last remark turned their attention toward the woman in the hammock
and they called to her Martha Oh Martha Come here You better
look after Harry Harry has found a lovenest Told you something would
happen if you let him go away alone

Putting aside her book the woman came to join the company on the
veranda

She was rather a handsome woman but with a suggestion of coarseness in
form and features though her face in spite of its tooevident signs of
dissipation was not a bad face

Seating herself on the top step with her back against the post in an
attitude of careless abandonment she looked up at the negro who stood
grinning in the doorway Bring me a highball Jim you know my kind
Then to the company Somebody give me a cigarette

Harry tossed a silver case in her lap Another man who sat near leaned
over her with a lighted match

Expelling a generous cloud of smoke from her shapely lips she
demanded What is this you are all shouting about Harry having another
lovenest

During the answering chorus of boisterous laughter and jesting remarks
she drank the liquor which the negro brought

Then Harry pointing out Auntie Sues house which was easily visible
from where they sat related his experience And among the many
conjectures and questions and comments offered no one suggested even
that the man and the woman living in that little log house by the river
might be entirely innocent of the implied charge For those who are
themselves guilty to assume the guilt of others is very natural and
altogether human

In the moments quiet which followed the arrival of a fresh supply of
drinks the woman called Martha said But what is the man like Harry
You have enthused quite enough about the girl Suppose you tell us about
the man in the case

Harry gave a very good description of Brian Kent

Oh damn suddenly cried Martha shaking her skirt vigorously She had
spilled some of the liquor from her glass

A woman on the outer edge of the circle whispered to her nearest
neighbor and a hush fell over the group

Well said Martha drinking the liquor remaining in her glass why
the devil dont we find out who they are if we are so curious

Find out How Well find out a lot What would you doask them their
names and where they are from came from the company

It is easy enough retorted Martha There is that native girl that
Molly picked up the day we landed here to help her in the kitchen She
must belong in this neighborhood somewhere Ill bet she can tell us
something What is her name

JudyJudy Taylor Great idea Good Send her out here Jim
responded the others

When the deformed mountain girl appeared before them she looked from
face to face with such a frightened and excited expression on her
sallow oldyoung features and such a wild light in her black beady
eyes that they regarded her with silent interest

Judy spoke first and her shrill monotone emphasized her excited state
of mind That there nigger said as how Missus Kent was awantin ter
see me Be ary one of youuns sure nough Missus Kent

The group drew apart a little and every face was turned from Judy to
the woman sitting on the top step of the veranda with her back against
the post

Judy went slowly toward the woman her beady eyes fixed and staring as
though at some ghostly vision The woman rose to her feet as Judy paused
before her

Be youall Brian Kents woman demanded Judy

The excited exclamation from the company and the manner of the woman
suddenly aroused the mountain girl to a realization of what she had done
in speaking Brian Kents name With an expression of frightened dismay
she turned to escape but the group of intensely interested spectators
drew closer Every one waited for Martha to speak

Yes she said slowly watching the mountain girl I am Mrs Brian
Kent Do you know my husband

Judys black beady eyes shifted slyly from one face to another and her
twisted body moved uneasily

No mam I aint asayin I knows him exactly I done heard tell bout
him nigh bout a year ago when there was some men from the city come
through here ahuntin him Everybody lows as how he was drowned at
Elbow Rock

The body was never found though murmured one of the men in the
group

Who lives in that little log house over there Judy Harry Green asked
suddenly pointing

There Oh that theres Auntie Sues place I lowed everybody knowed
that returned the girl

Who is Auntie Sue came the next question

One of the women answered before Judy could speak Auntie Sue is that
oldmaid schoolteacher they told us about Dont you remember Harry

Is Auntie Sue at home now girl asked Mrs Kent

Judys gaze was fixed on the ground as she replied I dont know mam
I aint got no truck with anybody on yon side the river

Is there any one living with Auntie Sue asked some one and in the
same breath from another came the question Who is Mr Burns

Judy jerked her twisted shoulders and threw up her head with an
impatient defiance as she returned shrilly Im atellin youuns I
dont know nothin bout nobody Hit aint no sort er use for youuns ter
pester me I dont know nothin bout hit an I wouldnt tell youuns
nothin if I did

And with this the mountain girl escaped into the house

While her friends on the veranda were looking at each other in
questioning silence Mrs Kent without a word turned and walked away
into the woods

As she disappeared among the trees one of the men said in a low tone
You better go after her Harry She is on all right that its Brian
Kent She never did believe that story about his death you know There
is no knowing what shell do when she gets to thinking it all over

It is a darned shame exclaimed one of the women to have our party
spoiled like this

Spoiled nothing answered another Martha is too good a sport to
spoil anything Go on Harry Cheer her up Bring her back here Well
all help get her good and drunk tonight and shell be all right

There was a laugh at this and some one said A little something
wouldnt hurt any of us just now Im thinking Here Jim

Harry Green found Mrs Kent sitting on the riverbank some distance above
the boat landing

She looked up at the sound of his approach but did not speak Dropping
down beside her the man said Im damned sorry about this Martha
I never dreamed I was starting anything or I would have kept my mouth
shut

It is Brian all right Harry she answered slowly It is funny but
he has been on my mind all day I never dreamed that it was this part
of the country where he was supposed to have been drowned or I wouldnt
have come here

Well what does it matter anyway returned the man I dont see that
it can make any difference We dont need to go down there where he is
and it is damned certain that they wont call on us

Looking out over the river the woman spoke as if thinking aloud This
is just the sort of place he would love Harrythe river and hills and
woods He never cared for the cityalways wanted to get away into
the country somewhere Tell me what is she really like Does she look
likelikewelllike any of our crowd

One by one the man picked a number of pebbles from among the dead
leaves and the short grass within reach of his hand as he answered
Oh I was just kidding when I raved about her to the bunch One by
one he flipped the bits of stone into the water She really doesnt
amount to much Honestly I hardly noticed her

The woman continued speaking as though thinking her thoughts aloud
Brian was a good man Harry That bank affair was really my fault He
never would have done such a thing if I hadnt devilled him all the time
for more money and made such a fuss about his wasting so much time in
his everlasting writing Id hate to have him caught and sent to the
pen now

Youre a good sport Martha he returned heartily I know just how
you feel about it And I can promise you that there is not one of our
crowd that will ever whisper a thing They are not that kind and you
know how they all like you Come dear Dont bother your head about it
any more I dont like to see you like this Let us go up to the house
and show them how game you areshall we

He put his arm about her but the woman gently pushed him away Dont
do that now Harry Let me think

That is just what you must not do he retorted with a laugh
Thinking cant help matters Come let us go get a drink That is what
you need

She looked at him some time before she answered then with a quick
movement she sprang to her feet

All right Youre on she cried with a reckless laugh But youll go
some if you keep up with me tonight

And so that evening while Brian Kent and Betty Jo from the porch of
the little log house by the river watched the twinkling lights of the
clubhouse windows the party with mad merriment tried to help a woman to
forget

But save for the unnatural brightness of her eyes and the heightened
color in her face drink seemed to have little effect on Martha Kent
that night When at a late hour the other members of the wild company
in various flushed and dishevelled stages of intoxication finally
retired to their rooms Martha in her apartment seated herself at the
window to look away over the calm waters of The Bend to a single light
that showed against the dark mountainside The woman did not know that
the light she saw was in Brian Kents room

Long after Betty Jo had said goodnight Brian walked the floor in
uneasy wakefulness The meeting with the man Green and his tooevident
thoughts as to the relations of the man and woman who were living
together in the log house by the river filled Brian with alarm while
the very presence of the man from the city awoke old apprehensions that
in his months of undisturbed quiet in Auntie Sues backwoods home had
almost ceased to be Through Auntie Sues teaching and influence his
work on his book the growing companionship of Betty Jo and their love
Brian had almost ceased to think of that absconding bank clerk who
had so recklessly launched himself on a voyage to the unknown in the
darkness of that dreadful night But now it all came back to him with
menacing strength

The man Green would talk to his companions of his visit to the log
house that afternoon He would tell what he had discovered Curiosity
would lead others of the clubhouse party to call Some one might
remember the story of the bank clerk who was supposed to have lost his
life in that neighborhood but whose body was never found There might
even be one in the party who knew the former clerk Through them the
story would go back to the outside world There would be investigations
by those whose business it was never to forget a criminal who had
escaped the law

Brian felt his ReCreation to be fully established but what if his
identity should be discovered before the restitution he would make
should be also accomplished And always as he paced to and fro in his
little room in the log house there was like a deep undercurrent in the
flow of his troubled thought his love for Betty Jo

It is little wonder that to Brian Kent that night the voices of the
river were filled with fearful doubt and sullen dreadful threatenings

And what of the woman who watched the tiny spot of light that marked
the window of the room where the recreated Brian Kent kept his lonely
vigil Did she too hear the voices of the river Did she feel the
presence of that stream which poured its dark flood so mysteriously
through the night between herself and the man yonder

Away back somewhere in the past the currents of their lives in the
onward flow of the river had drawn together For a period of time their
lifecurrents had mingled and with the stream had swept onward as
one Other influencesswirls and eddies and countercurrents of other
liveshad touched and intermingled until the current that was the man
and the current that was the woman had drawn apart For months they
had not touched and now they were drawing nearer to each other again
Would they touch Would they again mingle and become one What was this
mysterious unseen unknown but alwaysfelt power of the river that
sets the ways of its countless currents as it sweeps ever onward in its
unceasing flow

The door of her room opened Harry Green entered as one assured of a
welcome The woman at the window turned her head but did not move
Going to her the man with an endearing word offered a caress but she
put him aside Please Harryplease let me be alone tonight

Why Martha dear What is wrong he protested again attempting to
draw her to him

Resisting more vigorously she answered Everything is wrong You are
wrong I am wrong All life is wrong Cant you understand Please leave
me

The man drew back and spoke roughly in a tone of disgust Hell I
believe you love that bank clerk as much as you ever did

Well and suppose that were true Harry she answered wearily
Suppose it were truethat I did still love my husband Could that
make any difference now Can anything ever make any difference now You
will tire of me before long just as you have grown tired of the others
who were before me Dont you suppose I know You and our friends have
taught me many things Harry I know now that Brians dreams were
right That his dreams could never be realized does not make them
foolish nor wrong His dreams that seemed so foolishsuch impossible
idealswere more real after all than this life that we think so real
WE are the dreamerswe and our kindand our awakening is as sure to
come as that river out there is sure of reaching the sea

The man laughed harshly You are quite poetical tonight I believe I
like you better though when you talk sense

I am sorry Harry she returned Please dont be cross with me Go
nowplease go

And something forced the man to silence Slowly he left the room The
woman locked the door Returning to the window she fell on her knees
and stretched her hands imploringly toward the tiny spot of light that
still shone against the dark shadow of the mountainside

Between the mighty walls of treeclad hills that lifted their solemn
crests into the midnight sky the dark river poured the sombre strength
of its innumerable currentsterrible in its awful power dreadful in
its mysterious and unseen forces irresistible in its ceaseless onward
rush to the sea of its final and infinite purpose

And here and there on the restless evermoving surface of the shadowy
neverending flood twinkled the reflection of a star



CHAPTER XXII

AT THE EMPIRE CONSOLIDATED SAVINGS BANK


The President of the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank looked up from the
papers on his desk as his secretary entered from the adjoining room and
stood before him

Well George

The secretary smiled as he spoke Mr Ward there is an old lady out
here who insists that you will see her The boys passed her on to me
becausewell she is not the kind of woman that can be refused She
has no card but her name is Wakefield She

The dignified President of the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank
electrified his secretary by springing from his chair like a schoolboy
from his seat at the tap of the teachers dismissing bell Auntie Sue
I should say she couldnt be refused Where is she And before the
secretary could collect his startled thoughts to answer Homer T Ward
was out of the room

When the smiling secretary the stenographers and other attending
employees had witnessed a meeting between their dignified chief and
the lovely old lady which strengthened their conviction that the great
financier was genuinely human President Ward and Auntie Sue disappeared
into the private office

George said Mr Ward as he closed the door of that sacred inner
sanctuary of the Empire Consolidated Savings Bank remember I am not in
to any onefrom the Secretary of the Treasury to the Sheriff I am not
in

I understand sir returned the still smiling George And from that
moment until Homer T Ward should open the door nothing short of a
regiment could have interrupted the interview between Auntie Sue and her
old pupil

Placing the dear old lady tenderly in a deep leatherupholstered chair
Mr Ward stood before her as though trying to convince himself that
she was real while his teacher of those longago boyhood days gazed
smilingly up at him

What in the name of all that is unexpected are you doing here Auntie
Sue he demanded and why is not Betty Jo with you Isnt the girl
ever coming home There is nothing the matter with her is there Of
course not or you would have wired me

It was not at all like the bank president to ask so many questions all
at once

Auntie Sue looked around the private office curiously then smilingly
back to the face of the financier

Do you know Homer she said with her chuckling little laugh
IIam almost afraid of you in here Everything is so grand and
richlooking and there were so many men out there who tried to tell me
you would not see me II am glad I didnt know it would be like this
or I fear I never could have found the courage to come

Homer T Ward laughed and thenrather fullwaisted as he waswent
down on one knee at the arm of her chair so as to bring his face level
with her eyes

Look at me Auntie Sue he said look straight through me just as
you used to do years and years ago and tell me what you see

And the dear old lady with one thin soft hand on his heavy shoulder
answered as she looked Why I see a rather naughty boy whom I ought
to spank for throwing spitballs at the old schoolroom ceiling she
retorted And I am not a bit afraid to do it either So sit right over
there sir and listen to me

They laughed together then and if Auntie Sue wiped her eyes as the
schoolboy obediently took his seat in the big chair at the bankers
desk Homer T Wards eyes were not without a suspicious moisture

Tell me about Betty Jo first the man insisted You know Auntie Sue
the girl grows dearer to me every year

Betty Jo is that kind of a girl Homer Auntie Sue answered

I suppose it is because she is all I have to love he said but you
know ever since Sister Grace died and left the fatherless little kid
to me it seems like all my plans have centered around her and now that
she has finished her school has travelled abroad and gone through with
that businesscollege course I am beginning to feel like we should sort
of settle down together I am glad for her to be with you this summer
though for the finishing touches and when she comes home to stay you
are coming with her

Auntie Sue shook her head smiling Now Homer you know that is
settled I will never leave my little log house by the river until I
have watched the last sunset You know my dear boy that I would be
miserable in the city

It was an old point often argued by them and the man dismissed it now
with a brief Well see about that when the time comes But why didnt
you bring Betty Jo with you

Because Auntie Sue answered I came away hurriedly on a very
important trip for only a day and it is necessary for her to stay and
keep house while I am gone The child must learn to cook Homer even if
she is to inherit all your money

I know answered the bankerthe same as you make me work when I
visit you But your coming to me sounds rather serious Auntie Sue What
is your trouble

The dear old lady laughed nervously for to tell the truth she did
not quite know how she was going to manage to present Brian Kents case
to Homer T Ward without presenting more than she was at this time ready
to reveal

Why you see Homer she began it is not really my trouble as much
as it is yours and it is not yours as much as it is

Betty Jos he asked quickly when she hesitated

No no she cried The child doesnt even know why I am here Just
try to forget her for a few minutes Homer

All right he said but you had me worried for a minute

Auntie Sue might have answered that she was somewhat worried herself
but instead she plunged with desperate courage I came to see you
about Brian Kent Homer

It is not enough to say that the President of the Empire Consolidated
Savings Bank was astonished Brian Kent he said at last Why Auntie
Sue I wrote you nearly a year ago that Brian Kent was dead

Yes I know but he was notthat is he is not But the Brian Kent
your detectives were hunting wasI meanis

Homer T Ward looked at his old teacher as though he feared she had
suddenly lost her mind

It is like this Homer Auntie Sue explained A few days after
your detective Mr Ross called on me this stranger appeared in the
neighborhood No one dreamed that he was Brian Kent because you see
he was not a bit like the description

Full beard I suppose commented the banker grimly

Yes and every other way continued Auntie Sue And he has been
working so hard all winter and everybody in the country respects and
loves him so and he is one of the best and truest men I ever knew
and he is planning and working to pay back every cent he took and I
cannotI will notlet you send him to prison now

The lovely old eyes were fixed on the bankers face with sweet anxiety

Homer T Ward was puzzled Strange human problems are often presented
to men in his position but certainly this was the strangesthis old
teacher pleading for his absconding clerk who was supposed to be dead

At last he said with gentle kindness But why did you come to tell me
about him Auntie Sue He is safe enough if no one knows who he is

That is it she cried Some one found out about him and is coming
here to tell you for the reward

The banker whistled softly And youyougrabbed a train and beat em
to it he exclaimed Well if that doesnt

Auntie Sue clasped her thin hands to her breast and her sweet voice
trembled with anxious fear You wont send that poor boy to prison
now will you Homer Ititwould kill me if such a terrible thing
were to happen now Wont you let him go free so that he can do his
workwont you Homer II The strain of her anxiety was almost
too much for the dear old gentlewomans physical strength and as her
voice failed the tears streamed down the soft cheeks unheeded

In an instant the bank president was again on his knees beside her
chair

Dont Auntie Sue dont dear Why you know I would do anything
in the world you asked even if I wanted to send the fellow up but I
dont I wouldnt touch him for the world It is a thousand times better
to let him go if he is proving himself an honest man Please dear
dont feel so Why I will be glad to let him off Ill help him Auntie
Sue IIam as glad as you are that we didnt get him Please dont
feel so about it There thereit is all right now

So he comforted and reassured her until she was able to smile through
her tears I knew I could depend on you Homer

A few minutes later she said And what about that man who is coming to
claim the reward Homer

Never you mind him cried the banker Ill fix that But tell me
Auntie Sue where is young Kent now

He is working in the neighborhood she returned

He looked at her shrewdly You have seen a lot of him have you

I have seen him occasionally she answered Homer T Ward nodded his
head as if well pleased with himself You dont need to tell me any
more I understand now exactly It is very clear what has reformed
Brian Kent you have been up to your old tricks It is a wonder you
havent taken him into your house to live with youto save him from
associating with bad people

He laughed and when Auntie Sue only smiled as though humoring him in
his little joke he added By the way has Betty Jo seen this latest
patient of yours What does she think of his chances for complete
recovery

Yes Auntie Sue returned calmly Betty Jo has seen him But really
Homer I have never asked her what she thought of him

Do you know Auntie Sue said the banker reflectively I never did
believe that Brian Kent was a criminal at heart

I know he is not she returned stoutly But tell me Homer how did
it ever happen

Well you see he answered young Kent had a wife who couldnt
somehow seem to fit into his life Ross never went into the details with
me fully because that of course had no real bearing on the fact that
he stole the money from the bank But it seems that the youngster was
rather ambitiousstudied a lot outside of business hours and that sort
of thing I know he made his own way through business college before he
came to us The wife didnt receive the attention she thought she should
have I suppose Perhaps she was right at that Anyway she wanted a
good timewanted him to take her out more instead of spending his
spare time digging away at his books And so it went the usual wayshe
found other company Rather a gay set I fancy at least it led to her
needing more money than he was earning and so he helped out his salary
thinking to pay it back before he was caught I suppose Then the crash
camesome other man you knowand Brian skipped which of course
put us next to his stealing I dont know what has become of the woman
The last Ross knew of her she was living in St Louis and running with
a pretty wild bunchglad to get rid of Brian I expect She couldnt
have really cared so very much for him

Do you know Auntie Sue I have seen so many cases like this one
I have been glad many times that I never married And then again
sometimes I have seen homes that have made me sorry I never took the
chance I am glad you saved the boy Auntie Sue I am mighty glad

You have made me very happy Homer Auntie Sue returned But are you
sure you can fix it about that reward The man who is coming to claim it
will make trouble wont he if he is not paid somehow

Yes I expect he would returned the president thoughtfully And my
directors might have something to say And there are the Burns people
and the Bankers Association and all Hummm

Homer T Ward considered the matter a few moments then he laughed
Ill tell you what we will do Auntie Sue we will let Brian Kent pay
the reward himself That would be fair wouldnt it

Auntie Sue was sure that Brian would agree that it was a fair enough
arrangement but she did not see how it was to be managed

Then her old pupil explained that he would pay the rewardmoney to the
man who was coming to claim it and thus satisfy him and that the bank
would hold the amount as a part of the debt which Brian was expected to
pay

Auntie Sue never knew that President Ward himself paid to the bank
the full amount of the money stolen by Brian Kent in addition to the
rewardmoney which he personally paid to Jap Taylor in order to quiet
him and thus saved Brian from the publicity that surely would have
followed any other course

It should also be said here that Judys father never again appeared in
the Ozarks at least not in the Elbow Rock neighborhood It might be
that Jap Taylor was shrewd enough to know that his reputation would not
permit him to show any considerable sum of money where he was
known without starting an investigation and for men of his type
investigations are never to be desired

Or it is not unlikely that the combination of money and the city proved
the undoing of the moonshiner and that he came to his legitimate and
logical end among the dives and haunts of his kind to which he would
surely gravitate



CHAPTER XXIII

IN THE ELBOW ROCK RAPIDS


The day following that night of Brian Kents uneasy wakefulness was a
hard day for the man and the woman in the little log house by the river

For Brian the morning dawned with a sense of impending disaster He
left his room while the sky was still gray behind the eastern mountains
and the mist that veiled the brightness of the hills seemed to hide in
its ghostly depths legions of shadowy spirits that from his past had
assembled to haunt him The sombre aisles and caverns of the dimly
lighted forest were peopled with shadowy memories of that life which he
had hoped would never again for him awake And the river swept through
its gray world to the crashing turmoil at Elbow Rock like a thing doomed
to seek forever in its own irresistible might the destruction of its
everliving self

As one moving in a world of dreams he went about his mornings work
Old Prince whinnied his usual greeting but received no answer Bess
met him at the barnyard gate but he did not speak The sun leaped
above the mountaintops and the world was filled with the beauty of
its golden glory From tree and bush and swaying weed from forest and
pasture and garden and willowfringed riverbank the birds voiced
their happy greetings to the new day But the man neither saw nor heard

When he went to the house with his full milkpail and Betty Jo met him
at the kitchendoor with her cheery Goodmorning he tried resolutely
to free himself from the mood which possessed him but only partially
succeeded Several times as the two faced each other across the
breakfast table Brian saw the gray eyes filled with questioning
anxiety as though Betty Jo also felt the presence of some forbidding
spectre at the meal

After several vain attempts to find something they could talk about
Betty Jo boldly acknowledged the situation by saying What in the world
is the matter with us this morning Mr Burns I am possessed with the
feeling that there is some one or something behind me I want to look
over my shoulder every minute

At her words Brian involuntarily turned his head for a quick backward
glance

There cried Betty Jo with a nervous laugh not at all like her
normal wellpoised self You feel it too

Brian forced a laugh in return It is the weather I guess He tried
to speak with casual ease The atmosphere is full of electricity this
morning Well have a thunderstorm before night probably

And was it the electricity in the air that kept you tramping up and
down your room last night until almost morning she demanded abruptly
with her characteristic opposition to any evasion of the question at
issue

Brian retorted with a smile And how do you know that I tramped up and
down my room last night

The color in Betty Jos cheeks deepened as she answered I did not
sleep very well either

But I surely did not make noise enough for you to hear in your room
persisted Brian

The color deepened still more in Betty Jos checks as she answered
honestly I was not in my room when I heard you She paused and when
he only looked at her expectantly but did not speak continued in a
hesitating manner quite unlike her matteroffact self When I could
not sleep and felt so as though there were somebody or something in the
house that had no business here I became afraid and opened my door so
I would not feel so much alone and then I saw the light under the door
of your room and she hesitated but finished with a little air of
defianceand I went and listened outside your door to see if you were
up

Yes said Brian Kent gently

And when I heard you walking up and down I wanted to call to you but
I thought I better not It made me feel better though just to know
that you were there and so pretty soon I went back to my room again

And then said Brian

And then confessed Betty Jo whatever it was that was keeping me
awake came back and went on keeping me awake until I was simply forced
to go to you for help again

Poor Betty Jo She knew very well that she ought not to be saying those
things to the man who while he listened could not hide the love that
shone in his eyes

And Brian Kent as he thought of this woman whom he loved with all the
strength of his best self creeping to the door of his room for comfort
in the lonely night scarcely dared trust himself to speak At last
when their silence was becoming unbearable he said gently You poor
child Why didnt you call to me

And Betty Jo hearing in his voice that which told her how near he was
to the surrender that would bring disaster to them both was aroused to
the defense The gray eyes never wavered as she answered bravely I
was afraid of that too

And so Betty Jo confessed her love that answered so to his need but
in her very confession saved their love from themselves If she had
lowered her eyesBrian Kent in reverent acknowledgment bowed his
head before her Then rising he walked to the window where he stood
for some time looking out but seeing nothing

It was that horrid man coming yesterday that has so upset us said
Betty Jo at last We were getting on so beautifully too I wish he
had gone somewhere else for his vegetables and eggs and things

Brian was able to smile at this as he turned to face her again and they
both knew thatfor that time at leastthe dangerpoint was safely
past

I wish so too he agreed but never mind Auntie Sue will be home in
a day or two and then everything will be all right again

But when he had taken his hat and was starting out for the days work
Betty Jo asked What are you doing today

I was going to work on the fence around the clearing he answered
Why

IIwish you could find something to do nearer the house came the
slow answer Couldnt you work in the garden perhaps

I should say I could he returned heartily

All that forenoon as Betty Jo went about her household duties she felt
the presence of the thing that filled her so with fear and dread With
vigorous determination she scolded herself for being so foolish and
argued with herself that it was all a nervous fancy born of her restless
night But the next moment she would start with a sudden fear and turn
quickly as if to face some one whose presence she felt behind her And
Brian too as he worked in the garden caught himself often in the act
of pausing to look about with nervous apprehension

During the noonday meal they made a determined effort to laugh at
themselves and by the time dinner was over had almost succeeded But
when Brian as he pushed back his chair said jestingly Well am I
to work in the garden again this afternoon Betty Jo answered
emphatically Indeed you are I will not stay another minute in this
house alone Goodness knows what I will do tonight

There was no jest in the mans voice as he answered Ill tell you what
you will do tonightyou will go to bed and you will go to sleep You
will leave the door to your room wideopen and I shall lie right there
on that couch so near that a whisper from you will reach me We will
have no more of this midnight prowling I promise you If any ghost
dares appear we

The reassuring words died on Brian Kents lips His eyes looking over
Betty Jos shoulders were fixed and staring and the look on his face
sent a chill of horror to the girls heart She dared not move nor look
around as he sat like a man turned to stone

A womans laugh broke the dead silence

With a scream Betty Jo sprung to her feet and whirled about

As one in a trance Brian Kent arose and stood beside her

The woman who stood in the open doorway laughed again

Martha Kents heavy drinking the night before when her clubhouse
friends in a wild debauch had tried to help her to forget was the
climax of many months of like excesses The mood in which she had sent
the man Green from her room was the last despairing flicker of her
better instincts Moved by her memories of better thingsof a better
love and dreams and idealsshe had spent a little hour or two in
sentimental regret for that which she had so recklessly cast aside And
then because there was within her no foundation of abiding principle
for her sentiment she had again put on the character which had so
separated her from the life of the man to whom she was married indeed
but with whom she was never one With the burning consciousness of what
she might have been and of what she was ever tormenting her she sank
as the hours passed deeper and deeper into the quicksands of physical
indulgence until in her mad determination to destroy utterly her
ability to feel remorse she lost all mental control of herself and
responded to every insane whim of her drinkdisordered brain

As she stood there now in the doorway of that little log house by the
riverface to face with the man and the woman who though they
were united in their love were yet separated by the very fact of her
existenceshe was in all her hideous but pitiful repulsiveness the
legitimate creation of those lifeforces which she so fitly personified

Betty Jo instinctively drew closer to Brians side

Hello Brian dear said the woman with a drunken leer Thought Id
call to see you in your charming lovenest that Harry Green raved so
about Cant you introduce me to your little sweetheart

No she continued and laughed again Then coming an unsteady step
toward them she added thickly Very well Brian old sport you
wont introduce meIll have to introduce myself She grinned with
malicious triumph at Betty Jo Dont be frightened my dear Its all
right Im nobody of importancejust his wifethats alljust his
wife

Betty Jo with a little cry turned to the man who stood as if stricken
dumb with horror Brian she said Oh Brian

It was the first time she had ever addressed him by his given name and
Brian Kent as he looked saw in those gray eyes no hint of doubt or
censure but only the truest love and sympathy Betty Jo had not failed
in the moment of her supreme testing

Its true all right isnt it Brian said Martha Kent Im his wife
fast enough my dear But you dont need to worryyou two Im a good
sportI am Ive had my fun No kick coming from me Just called to
pay my respectsthats all Solong Brian old sport Goodbye my
dear

With an uncertain wave of her hand she staggered through the doorway
and passed from their sight

In the little log house by the river the two who had kept the fineness
of their love stood face to face

For Betty Jo the barrier which Brian Kent had maintained between them
to protect her from his love was no longer a thing unknown But the
revelation coming as it did had brought no shadow of distrust or doubt
of the man to whom she had so fully entrusted herself It had indeed
only strengthened her faith in him and deepened her love

For one glorious triumphal moment the very soul of the man exulted in
the truth which Betty Jo made known to him Then he turned slowly away
for he dared not trust himself to look at her a moment longer

With bowed head he paced up and down the room He went to the table
which held Auntie Sues sewingbasket and fingered the trifles there
Then slowly he passed through the open door to the porch where Betty
Jo through the window near which she stood saw him look away over the
river and the mountains

Suddenly she saw him start and stare intently at some nearer object
that had caught his attention As Betty Jo watched he moved to the edge
of the porch and stooping grasped the railing with his handshis
head and shoulders were thrust forward his lips were parted his
whole attitude was that of the most intense and excited interest Then
straightening up he threw back his head and laughed aloud But his
laughter alarmed the girl who ran to the door crying What is it
Brian

Look he shouted madly and pointed toward the river Look Betty
Jo

Martha Kent alone in one of the clubhouse boats was rowing with
drunken clumsiness toward the head of the Elbow Rock rapids

The womans friends had missed her and guessing from some remark she
had made where she had gone had sent four men of the party after her
for they realized that she was in no condition to be alone in a boat
on the river particularly on that part of the stream near Auntie Sues
place After leaving Brian and Betty Jo she had gone back to her boat
in the eddy at the foot of the garden and was pulling out into the
stream when she saw her friends approaching With a drunken laugh she
waved her hand and began rowing from them directly toward the swift
water The men shouted for her to stop and pulled with all their
strength But the woman taking their calls as a challenge rowed the
harder while every awkward pull of the oars carried her nearer the
deadly grip of the current

Betty Jo as she reached Brians side and saw what was happening on the
river grasped the mans arm appealingly with a cry Brian Brian She
is going into the rapids She will be carried down to Elbow Rock

But Brian Kent for the moment was beside himself All that he had
sufferedall that the woman out there on the river had cost him in
anguish of soulall that she had taken from him of happinesscame
before him with blinding vividness and nownowin her drunkenness
she was making her own way to her own destruction

Of course she is he shouted in answer to Betty Jo Her friends
yonder are driving her to it Could anything be more fitting

As though grasped by powerful unseen hands beneath the surface the boat
shot forward The woman feeling the sudden pull of the current stopped
rowing and looked about as if wondering what had happened Her friends
not daring to follow closer to the dangerous water were pulling madly
for the landing at the foot of the garden The boat in the middle of the
river moved faster

Look Betty Jo look shouted the man on the porch madly Its got
her nowthe river has got herlook

With a scream of fear the woman in the boat dropped her oars and
grasped the gunwale of the little craft

Brian Kent laughed

Betty Jo shrank back from him her eyes big with horror fixed upon
his face Then with a quick movement she sprang toward him again and
catching his arm shook him with all her strength and struck him again
and again with her fist

Brian Brian she cried You are insane

The man looked down at her for an instant with an expression of
bewildered astonishment on his face as one awakened from a dream He
raised his hand and drew it across his forehead and eyes

The boat with the helpless woman was already past the front of the
house

Betty Jo cried again as if calling the man she loved from a distance
Brian Brian

With a sudden movement the man jerked away from her The next instant
he had leaped over the railing of the porch to the ground below and was
running with all his might toward the river at an angle which would put
him opposite or a little below the boat when he reached the bank

With a sob Betty Jo followed as fast as she could

As Brian Kent raced toward the rivers edge the powerful current drew
the boat with the woman into the first rough water of the rapids and
as the skiff was shaken and tossed by the force that was sweeping it
with everincreasing speed toward the wild turmoil at Elbow Rock the
woman screamed again and again for help

The warring forces of the stream whirled the little craft about and
she saw the man who was nearing the bank She rose to her feet in the
rocking boat and stretched out her armscalling his name Brian
Brian Brian Then the impact of the boat against a larger wave of
the rapids brought her to her knees and she clung to the thwarts with
piteous cries

Betty Jo and the clubhouse men who had overtaken her saw Brian as
he reached the river opposite the boat For a little way he raced the
tumbling waters until he had gained a short distance ahead of the skiff
then they saw him without an instants pause leap from the high bank
far out into the boiling stream

Running along the bank the helpless watchers saw the man fighting his
way toward the boat One moment he disappeared from sight dragged
beneath the surface by the powerful currents with which he wrestled The
next instant the boiling waters would toss him high on the crest of a
rolling wave only to drag him down again a second later But always
he drew nearer and nearer the object of his struggle while the rapids
swept both the helpless woman and the tossing boat and the swimming man
onward toward the towering cliff and the thunderroar of the mad waters
below grew louder and louder

The splendid strength of arms and shoulders which Brian Kent had
acquired by his months of work with his ax on the timbered mountainside
sustained him now in his need With tremendous energy he breasted the
might of the furious river To the watchers it seemed at times that it
was beyond the power of human muscles to endure the terrific strain
Then he gained the boat and they saw him striving with desperate energy
to drag it toward the opposite shore and so into the currents that would
carry it past the menacing point of the cliff and perhaps to the safety
of the quiet water below

All that human strength could do in that terrible situation Brian Kent
did But the task was beyond the power of mortal man

For an instant the breathless watchers on the bank thought there was a
chance but the waters with mad fury dragged their victims back and
with terrific power hurled them forward toward the frowning rocks

It was quickly over

In that wild turmoil of the boiling leaping seething lashing
hammering waves the boat with the woman who crouched on her knees on
the bottom and the man who clung to the side of the craft appeared for
a second lifted high in the air The next instant the crash of breaking
wood sounded above the thundering roaring of the waters The man and
the woman disappeared The wreck of the boat was flung again and again
against the cliff until battered and broken it was swept away around
the point

Against the dark wall of rock Brian Kents head and shoulders appeared
for an instant and they saw that he held the woman in his arms The
furious waters closed over them For the fraction of a second the mans
hand and arm appeared again above the surface and was gone

Betty Jo sank to the ground with a low cry of anguish and hid her face

Another moment and she was aroused by a loud shout from one of the men
who had caught a glimpse of the rivers victims farther out at the point
of the rocky cliff

Springing to her feet Betty Jo started madly up the trail that leads
over the bluff The men followed

Immediately below Elbow Rock there is a deep hole formed by the waters
that pour around the point of the cliff and below this hole a wide
gravelly bar pushing out from the Elbow Rock side of the stream forces
the main volume of the river to the opposite bank In the shallow water
against the upper side of the bar they found them

With the last flicker of his consciousness Brian Kent had felt his feet
touch the bottom where the water shoals against the bar and with his
last remaining strength had dragged himself and the body of the woman
into the shallows

Betty Jo was no hysterical weakling to spend the priceless seconds of
such a time in senseless ravings The firstaid training which she had
received at school gave her the necessary knowledge which her native
strength of character and practical common sense enabled her to apply
Under her direction the men from the clubhouse worked as they probably
never had worked before in all their useless lives

But the man and the woman whose lifecurrents had touched and
mingleddrawn apart to flow apparently far from each other but drawn
together again to once more touch and as one to endure the testing
of the rapidsthe man and the woman had not brought to the terrible
ordeal the same strength

One was drawn into the Elbow Rock rapids by the careless indifference
and the reckless spirit that was born of the life she had chosen by
her immediate associates and environment and by the circumstances that
were at the last analysis of her own making

The other braved the same dangers strong in the splendid spirit that
had set him against such terrible odds to attempt the womans rescue
From his work on the timbered mountainside from his life in the clean
atmosphere of the hills and from the spiritual and mental companionship
of that little log house by the river he had brought to his testing the
splendid strength which enabled him to endure

Somewhere in that terrible conflict with the wild waters at Elbow Rock
while the man whose life she had so nearly ruined by her wantonness was
fighting to save her the soul of Martha Kent went from the bruised and
battered body which Brian drew at last from the vicious grasp of the
currents

But the man lived



CHAPTER XXIV

JUDYS RETURN


In the early evening twilight of the day following the tragedy at Elbow
Rock Betty Jo was sitting on the porch to rest for a few minutes in
the fresh air after long hours of watching beside Brians bed

A neighbor woman had come to help but Betty Jo would not leave the side
of the man she loved as he fought his way slowly out of the dark shadow
of the death that had so nearly conquered him Nor indeed would Brian
let her go for even in those moments when he appeared most unconscious
of the life about him he seemed to feel her presence All through
the long long hours of that anxious night and day she had watched and
waited the final issuefeeling the dark messenger very close at times
but gaining hope as the hours passed and her lover won his way nearer
and nearer to the lightcourageous alwaysgiving him the best of her
strength so far as it was possible to give him anythingmaking him
feel the steady enduring fullness of her love

At last they felt that the victory was won The doctor satisfied that
the crisis was safely past went his way to visit other patients By
evening Brian was resting so easily that the girl had stolen away for a
few minutes leaving the neighbor to call her if he should waken

Betty Jo had been on the porch but a short time when a step sounded on
the gravel walk that led from the porch steps around the corner of the
house A moment more and Judy appeared

The mountain girl stopped when she saw Betty Jo and the latter went to
the top of the steps

Goodevening Judy said Betty Jo quietly Wont you come in

Slowly with her black beady eyes fixed on Betty Jos face Judy went up
the steps

As the mountain girl reached the level of the porchfloor Betty Jo drew
a little back toward the door

Judy stopped instantly and stood still Then in a low tone she said
Youall aint got no call ter be afeared Miss Betty Jo You haint
never goin ter have no call ter be scared of me again never

I am so glad for you to say that Judy returned Betty Jo smiling I
dont want to be afraid of you and I am not really but

Aint youall plumb ahatin me for what I done asked Judy
wonderingly

No no Judy dear I dont hate you at all and you must know that
Auntie Sue loves you

Yes Judy nodded her head thoughtfully Auntie Sue just naturally
loves everybody Hit wouldnt be no moren nature though for youall
ter hate me I sure have been poisonmean

But that is all past now Judy said Betty Jo heartily Come and sit
down She started toward the chairs

But the mountain girl did not move except to shake her head in refusal
of the hospitable invitation

I aint agoin ter put my foot inside this house nor set with
youall nor nothin til Ive said what I done come ter say

Betty Jo turned back to her again What is it Judy

Auntie Sue done told me not ter let youall er Mr Burns see me til

none I reckon she aint agoin ter mind so much Youall dont know
that I seed Auntie Sue that night fore she went away an that hit was

tell us about it I would rather you did not Judy

I aint aimin ter Judy returned but Auntie Sue dont know nothin
bout whats happened since she went away an hits that whats
amakin me come ter youall

Betty Jo seeing that the poor girl was laboring under some intense
emotional stress said gently What is it that you wish to tell me
Judy I am sure Auntie Sue will not mind if you feel so about it

The mountain girls eyes filled and the tears streamed down her sallow
cheeks while her twisted shoulders shook with the grief she could not
suppress as she faltered My GodAmighty Miss Betty Jo IIdidnt
aim ter do hit I sure didnt Fore God Id er let em kill me first
if Id only had time ter think But hithitwas me what told that
there woman how Mr Burns was Brian Kent Hitshitsme whats ter

ter come back an help youall take care of him an live with Auntie
Sue ananbe a little might like youuns if I kin Will you let me
Miss Betty Jo Will you I most know Auntie Sue would if she was here

Before the mountain girl had finished speaking Betty Jos arm was
around the poor twisted shoulders and Betty Jos eyes were answering
Judys pleading

And so when Auntie Sue came home it was Judy who met her at the
station with Old Prince and the buggy and as they drove down the
winding road to the little log house by the river the mountain girl
told the old gentlewoman all that had happened in her absence

THE RIVER


Brian Kent recovered quickly from the effects of his experience in the
Elbow Rock rapids and was soon able again to take up his work on the
little farm Every day he labored in the garden or in the clearing or
at some task which did not rightly fall to those who rented the major
part of Auntie Sues tillable acreage

Auntie Sue had told him about her visit to the President of the Empire
Consolidated Savings Bank and of the arrangement made by the bankeras
she understood itfor Brians protection But while the dear old lady
explained that Homer T Ward was one of her pupils she did not reveal
the relation between Brians former chief and Betty Jo Neither Auntie
Sue nor Betty Jo for several very good reasons was ready for Brian to
know the whole truth about his stenographer It was quite enough they
reasoned for him to love his stenographer and for his stenographer
to love him without raising any more obstacles in the pathway of their
happiness

As the busy weeks passed several letters came from the publishers of
Brians bookletters which made the three in the little log house
by the river very happy Already in the first reception of this new
writers work those who had undertaken to present it to the public saw
many promises of the fulfillment of their prophecies as to its success
When the third letter came a statement of the sales to date was
enclosed and that afternoon Betty Jo went to Brian where he was at
work in the clearing

When they were comfortably not to say cozily seated on a log in the
shade at the edge of the forest she announced that she had come for a
very serious talk

Yes he returned but he really looked altogether too happy to be
exceedingly serious

Yes she continued I have As your accredited business agent and
she favored him with a Betty Jo smileshall I say manager

Why not managing owner he retorted

I am glad you confirm my promotion so readily she returned with a
charming touch of color in her cheeks because that you see helps me
to present what I have to say for the good of the firm

I am listening Betty Jo

Very well tell me first Brian just exactly how much do you owe that
bank rewardmoney and all and Auntie Sue interest and everything

Brian went to his coat which lay on a nearby stump and returned with
a small pocket accountbook

I have it all here he said as he seated himself close beside her
again And opening the book he showed her how he had kept a careful
record of the various sums he had taken from the bank with the dates

Oh Brian Brian she said with a little cry of delight I am so
gladso glad you have this It is exactly what I want for my wedding
present It was so thoughtful of you to fix it for me

Thus by a characteristic Betty Jo turn she made the little book of
painful memories a book of joyous promise

When they again returned to the consideration of business matters
Brian gave her the figures which answered her questions as to his total
indebtedness

Again Betty Jo exclaimed with delight Brian do you see Take your
pencil and figure quick your royalties on the number of books sold as
given in the publishers statement

Brian laughed I have figured it

And your book has already earned more than enough to pay everything
said Betty Jo Isnt that simply grand Brian

It is pretty grand all right he agreed The only trouble is I
must wait so long before the money is due me from the publishers

That is exactly what I came to talk about she returned quickly I
tried to have it different when I made the arrangements with them but
the terms of payment in the contract are the very best I could get and
so I have planned a little plan whereby youthat is wewont need to
wait for your freedom until the date of settlement with the publishers

You have a plan which will do that Brian questioned doubtfully

She nodded vigorously with another Betty Jo smile This is the plan
and you are not to interrupt until I have finished everything I happen
to have some money of my very very own which is doing nothing but
earning interest

At the look on Brians face she stopped suddenly but when he started
to speak she put her hand quickly over his mouth saying You were
not to say a single word until I have finished Play fair Brian dear
please

When he signified that he would not speak she continued in her most
matteroffact and businesslike tone There is every reason in the
world Brian why you should pay off your debt to the bank and to Auntie
Sue at the earliest possible moment You can think of several reasons
yourself There is me for instance

Very well You have the money to your credit with the publishers but
you cant use it yet I have money that you can just as well use You
will make an assignment of your royalties to me all in proper form to
cover the amount you need You will pay me the same interest my money is
now earning where it is

I will arrange for the money to be sent to you in the form of a
cashiers cheque payable to the banker Homer T Ward so the name
Brian Kent does not appear before we are ready you see You will make
believe to Auntie Sue that the money is from the publishers You will
send the cheque to Mr Bank President personally with a statement
of your indebtedness to him properly itemized interest figured on
everything You will instruct him to open an account for you with the
balance And thenthen Brian you will give dear Auntie Sue a cheque
for what you owe her with interest of course And we will all be so
happy Andanddont you think I am a very good managing owner You
do dont you

When he hesitated she added And the final and biggest reason of all
is that I want you to do as I have planned more than I ever wanted
anything in the world except you and I want this so because I want
you You cant really refuse now can you

How indeed could he refuse

So they worked it out together as Betty Jo had planned and when the
time came for the last and best part of the plan and Brian confessed to
Auntie Sue how he had robbed her and had known for so long that she was
aware of his crime against her and finished his confession by giving
her the cheque it is safe to say that there was nowhere in all the
world more happiness than in the little log house by the river

GodAmighty sure helped me to do one good turn anyway when I jumped
inter the river after that there book when Mr Burns done throwd hit
away commented the delighted Judy

And while they laughed together Betty Jo hugged the deformed mountain
girl and answered God Almighty was sure good to us all that day
Judy dear

It was only a day later when Auntie Sue received a letter from Homer T
Ward which sent the dear old lady in great excitement to Betty Jo The
banker was coming for his longdeferred vacation to the log house by the
river

There was in his letter a kindly word for his former clerk Brian Kent
should Auntie Sue chance to see him much love for his old teacher and
for the dearest girl in the world his Betty Jo

But that part of Homer T Wards letter which most excited Auntie
Sue and caused Betty Jo to laugh until she cried was this The great
financier who even in his busy life of large responsibilities found
time for some good reading had discovered a great book by a new and
heretofore unknown writer The book was great because every page of it
Homer T Ward declared reminded him of Auntie Sue If the writer had
known her for years he could not have drawn a truer picture of her
character nor presented her philosophy of life more clearly It was a
remarkable piece of work It was most emphatically the sort of writing
that the world needed This new author was a genius of the rarest and
best sort Mr Ward predicted boldly that this new star in the literary
firmament was destined to rank among those of the first magnitude
Already among the bankers closest book friends the new book was being
discussed and praised He would bring a copy for Auntie Sue and Betty
Jo to read It was not only the book of the yearit was in Homer T
Wards opinion one of the really big books of the Century

Well commented Betty Jo when they had read and reread that part of
the letter dear old Uncle Homer may be a very conservative banker
but he certainly is more than liberal when he touches on the question of
this new author Wont we have fun Auntie Sue Oh wont we

Then they planned the whole thing and proceeded to carry out their
plan

Brian was told only that Mr Ward was coming to visit Auntie Sue and
that he must be busy somewhere away from the house when the banker
arrived and not come until he was sent for because Auntie Sue must
make a full confession to her old pupil of the part she had played
in the ReCreation of Brian Kent before Homer T Ward should meet his
former clerk

Brian never dreaming that there were other confessions to be made
smilingly agreed to do exactly as he was told

When the momentous day arrived Betty Jo met her uncle in Thompsonville
and all the way home she talked so continuously of her school and asked
so many questions about his conduct and life and their many Chicago
friends that the helpless bank president had no chance whatever of
asking her a single embarrassing question But when dinner was over
Brian had taken his lunch with him to the clearing Homer T Ward
wanted to know things

Was Brian Kent still working in the neighborhood

Auntie Sue informed him that Brian was still working in the
neighborhood

Betty Jo had seen the bank clerk Betty Jos uncle supposed What did
she think of the fellow

Betty Jo thought Brian Kent was a rather nice fellow

And how had Betty Jo been amusing herself while her old uncle was
slaving in the city

Betty Jo had been doing a number of things Helping Auntie Sue with her
housework learning to cook keeping up her stenographic work reading

Reading That reminded him and forthwith Mr Ward went to his room
and returned with the book

And then those two blessed women listened and admired while he
introduced them to the new genius and read certain favorite passages
from the great book and grew enthusiastic on the new author saying all
that he had written in his letter and many things more until Betty Jo
could restrain herself no longer but ran to him and took the book from
his hands and with her arms around his neck told him that he was the
dearest uncle in the world because she was going to marry the man who
wrote the book he so admired

There were long explanations after that How the book so highly valued
by Banker Ward had actually been written in that very log house by the
river how Auntie Sue had sent for Betty Jo to assist the author with
her typewriting how the author not knowing who Betty Jo was had
fallen in love with his stenographer and finally how Betty Jos
authorlover was even then waiting to meet her guardian still not
knowing that her guardian was the banker Homer T Ward

You see uncle dear explained Betty Jo Auntie Sue and I were
obliged to conspire this little conspiracy against my man because you
know authors are funny folk and you never can tell exactly what they
are going to do After giving your heart to a genius as wonderful as you
yourself know this one to be it would be terrible to have him refuse
you just because you were the only living relative of a rich old
bankerit would wouldnt it uncle dear

And really Homer T Ward could find reason in Betty Jos argument
which ended with that fatal trick question

Taking his agreement for granted Betty Jo continued And you see
Auntie Sue and I were simply forced to conspire a little against you
uncle dear because you know perfectly well that much as I needed the
advantage of associating with such an authorman in the actual writing
of his book you would never never have permitted me to fall in love
with him before you had discovered for yourself what a great man he
really is and I simply had to fall in love with him because God made
me to take care of a genius of some sort And if you dont believe that
you can ask Judy Judy has found out a lot about God lately

You wont think I am talking nonsense or am belittling the occasion
will you uncle dear she added anxiously I am nottruly I am
notI am very serious But I cant help being a little excited can I
Because it is terrible to love a bankeruncle as I love you and at
the same time to love a geniusman as I love my man andandnot know
what you two dearest men in the world are going to do to each other

And at this the girls arms were about his neck again and the girls
head went down on his shoulder and he felt her cheek hot with blushes
against his and a very suspicious drop of moisture slipped down inside
his collar

When he had held Betty Jo very close for a while and had whispered
comforting things in her ear and had smiled over her shoulder at his
old teacher the banker sent the girl to find her lover while he should
have a serious talk with Auntie Sue

The long shadows of the late afternoon were on the mountainside when
Brian Kent and Betty Jo came down the hill to the little log house by
the river

The girl had said to him simply You are to come now BrianAuntie
Sue and Mr Ward sent me to tell you

She was very serious and as they walked together clung closely to his
arm And the man too seeming to feel the uselessness of words for such
an occasion was silent When he helped her over the railfence at the
lower edge of the clearing he held her in his arms for a little then
they went on

They saw the beautiful treeclad hills lying softly outlined in the
shadows like folds of green and timeworn velvet extending ridge
on ridge into the blue They saw the river their river making its
gleaming way with many a curve and bend to the mighty sea that was
hidden somewhere far beyond the distant skyline of their vision and
between them and the river at the foot of the hill they saw the little
log house with Auntie Sue and Homer T Ward waiting in the doorway

When the banker saw the man at Betty Jos side his mind was far from
the clerk whom he had known more than a year before in the city His
thoughts were on the author the scholar the genius whose book had
so compelled his respect and admiration This tall fellow with the
athletic shoulders and deeply tanned face who was dressed in the rude
garb of the backwoodsman with his coat over his arm his ax on his
shoulder and his dinnerpail in his handwho was he And why was
Betty Jo so familiar with this strangerBetty Jo who was usually
so reserved with her air of competent selfpossession Homer T Ward
turned to look inquiringly at Auntie Sue

His old teacher smiled back at him without speaking

Then Betty Jo and Brian Kent were standing before him

Here he is Uncle Homer said the girl

Brian hearing her speak those two revealing words and seeing her go to
the bank president who put his arm around her with the loving intimacy
of a father stood speechless with amazement looking from Homer T Ward
and Betty Jo to Auntie Sue and back to the banker and the girl

Mr Ward still not remembering the bank clerk in this recreated Brian
Kent was holding out his hand with a genial smile

As the bewildered Brian mechanically took the hand so cordially
extended the older man said It is an honor sir to meet a man who
can do the work you have done in writing that book It is impossible to
estimate the value of such a service as you have rendered the race You
have a rare and wonderful gift Mr Burns and I predict for you a life
of remarkable usefulness

Brian still confused but realizing that Mr Ward had not recognized
him looked appealingly at Betty Jo and then to Auntie Sue

Auntie Sue spoke Mr Ward is the uncle and guardian of Betty Jo
Brian

Brian ejaculated the banker

Auntie Sue continued Homer dear Betty Jo has presented HER author
Mr Burnspermit me to introduce MY Brian Kent

And Judy remarked that evening when after supper they were all on the
porch watching the sunset Hit sure is dad burned funny how all tangled
an snarled up everythin kin git fore a body kin think most an
then if a bodyll just keep agoin right along all ter onct hits all
straightened out as purty as anythin

They laughed happily at the mountain girls words and the dear old
teachers sweet voice answered Yes Judy it is all just like the
river dont you see

Meanin as how the water gits all tangled an mixed up when hits
aboilin an aroarin like mad down there at Elbow Rock an then all
ter onct gits all smooth an calm like again returned Judy

Meaning just that Judy returned Auntie Sue No matter how tangled
and confused life seems to be it will all come straight at the last
if like the river we only keep going on

And when the dreamy Indiansummer days were come and the blue haze of
autumn lay softly over the brown and gold of the beautiful Ozark hills
the mountain folk of the Elbow Rock neighborhood gathered one day at the
little log house by the river

It was a simple ceremony that made the man and the woman who were so
dear to Auntie Sue husband and wife But the backwoods minister was not
wanting in dignity though his dress was rude and his words plain and
the service lacked nothing of beauty and meaning though the guests
were but humble mountaineers for love was there and sincerity and
strength and rugged kindliness

And when the simple wedding feast was over they all went down to
the riverbank at the lower corner of the garden where at the eddy
landing a staunch Johnboat waited equipped and ready

When the last goodbyes were spoken and Brian and Betty Jo put out from
the little harbor into the stream Auntie Sue with Judy and Homer T
Ward went back to the porch of the little log house there to watch the
beginning of the voyage

With Brian at the oars the boat crossed the stream to the safer
waters close to the other shore and then with Betty Jo waving her
handkerchief and the neighbor men and boys running shouting along the
bank swept down the river past the roaring turmoil of the Elbow Rock
rapids into the quiet reaches below and away on its winding course
between the treeclad hills

I am so glad said Auntie Sue her dear old face glowing with love
and her sweet voice tremulous with feeling I am so glad they chose the
river for their wedding journey

HAROLD BELL WRIGHT

A Biography

By ELSBERY W REYNOLDS


The biography of a man is of importance and interest to other men just
to the degree that his life and work touches and influences the life of
his time and the lives of individuals

Only in a feeble way at best can the life story of any man be told on
the printed page The story is better as it is written on the hearts of
men and women and the man himself does the writing

He lives longest who lives best He who carves deepest against corroding
time is he who touches with surest hand the greatest number of human
hearts

He may or may not be a prodigy of physical strength He may or may not
be a tower of mental energy But so long as this old world stands the
man with an overpowering desire for all that is best for the race to
be in the race whose life is in tune with the divine and with the good
that is within us all whether he be orator writer artist or artisan
is a giant among men

That which we read makes a deeper and more lasting impression on our
lives than that which we see or hear An author with millions of readers
must be a great central power of thought and influence at least in his
own day and generation We can understand the truth of this through a
study of the aims and life purposes of Harold Bell Wright as expressed
through his books and the circumstances under which they were written
The wonderful popularity of this author is well estimated by the
millions of copies of his books that have been sold This is also the
greatest testimonial that can be given to the merit of his work The
great heart of the reading public is an unprejudiced critic Is not
the greatest voice the one to which the greatest number of hearts listen
with pleasure

When a man has attained to great eminence under adverse circumstances we
sometimes wonder to what heights he might have climbed under conditions
more favorable Who can tell It is just as easy to say what the young
man of twenty will be when a matured man of forty The boy of poverty
makes a man of power while the boy nursed in the lap of luxury makes
a man of uneventful life and again a life started with a handicap
remains so through its possible three score years and ten and the life
begun with advantages multiplies its talents ten and a hundred fold

So after all is not the heart of man the real man and is it not
the guiding star of his ambition his will his determination his
conscience

Harold Bell Wright the second of four sons was born May 4 1872 in
Rome Oneida County New York From an earlier biographer we quote the
following

Some essential facts must be dug from out the past where they lie
embedded in the detrital chronicles of the race Say then that away
back in 1640 a ship load of AngloSaxon freedom landed in New England
After a brief period some of the more venturesome spirits emigrated to
the far west and settled amid the undulations of the Mohawk valley
in central New York Protestant France also sent westward some
Gallic chivalry hungering for freedom The fringe of this garment of
civilization spread out and reached also into the same valley English
determination and Huguenot aspiration touched elbows in the war for
political and religious freedom and touched hearts and hands in
the struggle for economic freedom Their generations were a genuine
aristocracy Mutual struggles after mutual aims cemented casual
acquaintance into enduring friendship William Wright met loved
and married Alma T Watson To them four sons were born A carpenter
contractor a man who builds contrives and constructs is joined to
a woman into whose soul of wholesome refinement come images of dainty
beauty where they glow and grow radiant With lavish unrestraint the
life of this French woman pours itself into her sons The third child
died in infancy The eldest survived his mother by some thirteen years
The youngest is a constructive mechanical engineer The second son is
Harold Bell Wright

During ten years this mother and this son live in rare intimacy The
boys first enduring impression of this life is the vision of the mother
bending affectionately over him while criticising the water color sketch
his unpracticed fingers had just made Crude blendings and faulty
lines were pointed out then touched into harmony and more accurate
perspective by her quick skill Together their eyes watched shades dance
on sunny slopes cloud shadows race among the hills or lie lazily in the
valley below

Exuberant Nature and ebullient boy loved each other from the first
Alone enravished he often wandered far in sheer joy of living He
brings one day from his rambles a bunch of immortelles which mother
graciously receives Twenty years later the boy mangrown bows
reverently over a box of withered flowersthe same bouquet the mother
took that day and laid away as a precious memento of his boyish love
Such was the first decade

A tenyearold boy motherless steals from harsh labor and yet harsher
surroundings runs to the home of sacred memories clambers to the
attic and spends the night in anguished solitude This was his first
Gethsemane For ten years buffeted and beaten battling with adversity
sometimes losing but never lost snatching learning here and there
hating sham loving passionately misunderstood misapprehended too
stubbornly proud to ask apologies or make useless explanations fighting
poverty in the depths of privation wrestling existence from toil he
loathed befriending many and also befriended much but always face to
face with the grim tragedy which has held part of the stage since Eden

Such was the second decade The first was spent on hill sides where
shadows only made the light more buoyant as they fled away The second
was passed in the valley where the shadow hung lazily till the cloud
grew very black and drenched the soil

Lured to college he undertook to acquire academic culture As is
well known college life with its professorial anecdotes and jokes its
student pranks and grind is routine drudgery and cobwebbery prose
Bookish professors and conventional students rarely have just such an
animate problem of French artistry and Bohemian experience to solve
They did nobly to be sure but here was a mind which threw over them
all the glamour of romance

Mr Wright entered the Preparatory Department of Hiram College at the
age of twenty having previously accepted the faith and identified
himself with the Christian Church in the little quarry town of Grafton
Ohio He continued active in the different departments of work in his
church all during his school years with the ultimate result of his
entering the ministry

Having no financial means while in school he made his way by doing odd
jobs about town house painting and decorating sketching etc After
two years of school life while laboring to gain funds in order that he
might continue his schooling he contracted from overwork and outdoor
exposure a severe case of pneumonia that left his eyesight badly
impaired and his constitution in such condition that to the present
day he has never fully recovered

Air castles were tumbled and hopes blasted when his physician advised
him that it would be fatal to reenter school for at least another
year Whereupon seeking health and a means of existence starting from
a point on the Mahoning river he canoed with sketch and note book but
alone down stream a distance of more than five hundred miles From
this point by train he embarked for the Ozark mountains in southwest
Missouri Here for some months while gradually regaining his strength
he secured employment at farm work sketching and painting at intervals

Once more he found himself on bedrock taking his last cent to pay
express charges back to Ohio on some finished pictures but this time
fortune smiled promptly with a good check by return mail

It was while in the Ozarks that Harold Bell Wright preached his first
sermon Being a regular attendant at the services held in the little
mountain log school house he was asked to talk to the people one
Sunday when the regular preacher had failed to appear

From this Sunday morning talk that could hardly be called a sermon and
others that followed he came to feel that he could do more good in the
ministry than he could in any other field of labor and soon thereafter
accepted a regular pastorate at Pierce City Missouri at a yearly
salary of four hundred dollars True to a resolve that his work should
be that through which he could help the most people he had now chosen
the ministry A further resolve that he would give up this ministry
chosen with such earnest conviction should another field of labor offer
more extensive measures for reaching mankind took him in later years
into the field of literature He left the ministry with many regrets but
with the same earnest conviction with which he had earlier chosen it

Following the publication of The Shepherd of the Hills his publishers
assured him that he could secure greater results from his pen rather
than his pulpit and prevailed upon him to henceforth make literature his
life work This was in every way consistent with his teaching that every
mans ministry is that work through which he can accomplish the greatest
good

In the battle of life there is always the higher ground that the many
covet but few attain In reaching this height Mr Wright has given to
a multitude his time strength and substance that they too might
further advance He is companionable loving and loyal to his friends
He hates sham and hypocrisy and any attempt to glorify ones self by
means other than the fruits of ones own labor

This boy who from the death of his mother was driven into a hand to
hand struggle with life for a bare existence was necessarily forced
into contact with much that was vicious and corrupt But he in no way
became a part of it That same inherent love for mental cleanliness and
spiritual truths that has so distinguished the works of the man kept the
boy unstained in his unfortunate environment

Mr Wright resigned his charge at Pierce City for the larger work at
Pittsburg Kansas In the second year of his pastorate1899he
married Frances E Long in Buffalo New York This union of love had
its beginning back in the school days at Hiram Unto them have been born
three sons Gilbert Munger 1901 Paul Williams 1902 and Norman Hall
1910

In Pittsburg Mr Wright received enthusiastic support from his church
people Finances were soon in a satisfactory condition and church
attendance reached the capacity of the building but still the young
pastor was not satisfied Pittsburg was a mining town a young mens
town A little city with saloons and brothels doing business on every
hand His soul was on fire for his church to do a larger work and with
the hope of arousing his people he conceived the idea of writing That
Printer of Udells planning to read the story by installments on
special evenings of successive weeks to his congregation

Pittsburg was made the principal scene and the church of the story was
the kind of church he wanted his Pittsburg charge to be The teachings
set forth through the preacher of the story in the latter half of
the book are the identical things the author was preaching The first
chapters of the story are very largely colored by Mr Wrights early
life but they are by no means autobiographical

That Printer of Udells was written without thought or intention of
offering it for publication During the authors ministry he made some
of the warmest and most abiding friendships of his life and it was
through certain of these friends that he was persuaded from reading the
story as intended but to offer it for publication giving it thus a
wider usefulness

Having a leave of absence of several weeks from his church during the
winter of 19012 he accepted an invitation from the pastor of a Chicago
church to hold a special meeting and it was during this meeting
that the author and his publisher met for the first time Mr Wright
delivered a sermon entitled Sculptors of Life that was so impressive
that I sought him out with entreaties to repeat his sermon as a lecture
to a certain company of young people

The acquaintance thus begun very quickly became one of friendship
without any knowledge or thought that it would in time lead to a
cooperative life work and when the author later offered his book for
publication it was without request or thought of financial remuneration
Mr Wright however was given a contract paying him the highest royalty
that was being paid for any authors first book

That Printer of Udells was written almost entirely in the late hours
of the night and the very early hours of the morning Great demands were
being made on the authors time in the way of requests for officiating
and speaking at public and civic functions in addition to the now heavy
requirements of his church His aggressive activities backed by his
splendid spirit fearlessness and courage in combating the evils of his
little city made for him a host of admirers alike among his enemies
and friends When he left to accept a pastorate in Kansas City
Missouri his resignation was not accepted

After one year in Kansas City he found that he was not physically able
to carry out the great city work as he had dreamed it and planned it
on a scale that would satisfy his longings for service and it made him
seriously consider whether there was not some other way that would more
equally measure with his strength He went again to the Ozarks this
time for rest and meditation and while there began writing The
Shepherd of the Hills This Story has a peculiar significance for
the author He feels toward it as he can not feel for any of his other
books The Shepherd of the Hills was written as a test The strength
of the message he was able to put into the story and the response it
should find in the hearts of men and women was to decide for him his
ministry henceforth whether he would teach the precepts of the Man of
Galilee by voice or pen It was a testing time that bore fruit not only
in this simple sweet story that to quote an eminent divine is one of
the greatest sermons of our day but resulted as well in the splendid
volumes that have followed

The Shepherd of the Hills was finished during the year of his
pastorate at Lebanon Missouri and but for the sympathy encouragement
and helpful understanding of his church officers and membership it is
doubtful if the story could ever have been completed When Mr Wright
delivered the manuscript to his publishers the first of the year 1907
for publication the next fall he had accepted the pastorate of the
Christian Church in Redlands California hoping this land of sunshine
would give him a larger measure of health

Some months later resigning his Redlands pastorate he went to the
Imperial Valley and there the following year wrote The Calling of Dan
Matthews The church and its problems were weighing on the author and
affecting his life no less than when he was in the ministry and it was
only natural that he should give to the world a picture that is true
to the four corners of the earth Every incident in the story has its
counterpart in real life and with but few exceptions came under the
authors personal observation He did not get the real pleasure out
of writing The Calling of Dan Matthews that he did the story which
preceded it But he could not try as he would escape it

The publication of The Calling of Dan Matthews in the fall of 1909 was
just two years after the publication of The Shepherd of the Hills

The Winning of Barbara Worth required more time and effort in the
collecting of material than any book the author had written but
probably gave him at least as much pleasure He is very careful with
regard to descriptive detail and even while writing The Calling of Dan
Matthews he was making a study of the desert and this great reclamation
project Before sending his manuscript for publication he had it checked
over by the best engineers on the Pacific coast for inaccuracies in any
of his descriptions that involved engineering or reclamation problems

The Winning of Barbara Worth bears the distinction without doubt
of being the only book ever published that called its publisher and
illustrator from a distance of two and three thousand miles into the
heart of a great desert for a consultation with its author This story
of the Imperial Valley and its reclamation was written in the same study
as was The Calling of Dan Matthews A study of rude construction
about eighteen by thirtyfive feet with thatched roof and outside
covering of native arrowweed and built entirely by the author himself

When Mr Wright finished The Winning of Barbara Worthso named in
honor of Ruth Barbara Reynoldshe was a sick man He often worked the
night through overtaxing his nerve and strength For several months he
virtually dwelt within the four walls of his study and for a time it was
feared he would not live to finish the book He wrote the last chapters
while confined to his bed after which he was taken by easy stages
through the kindness of friends to that part of Northern Arizona that
is so delightful to all lovers of the outofdoors In this bracing
milehigh atmosphere he soon grew well and strong almost to ruggedness
and on the day his book was published he was riding in a wildhorse
chase over a country wild and rough where the writer of this sketch
would only care to go carefully picking his way on foot So it was
weeks after publication before the author saw the first bound copy
of his book During these summer and fall months while regaining his
strength he was busy with sketch and note book collecting material for
this part of Arizona is the scene of his novel When a Mans a Man

Their Yesterdays was written in Tucson Arizona and was published in
the fall of 1912 just one year after the publication of The Winning
of Barbara Worth In order to write this story with the least possible
strain on his nerves and vitality Mr Wright secluded himself in a
little cottage purchased especially for this work His material was
collected from the observations of his thoughtful years and his intimate
knowledge of human hearts This book is perhaps more representative
of the real Harold Bell Wright than anything he has done It is the true
presentation of his views on life love and religion I once asked Mr
Wright in behalf of the faculty to deliver an address to a graduating
class of some twentyodd young men of the Morgan Park Academy Chicago
He was very busy and I suggested that without special effort he make the
commonplace remarks that one so often hears on like occasions For the
first time that I remember he somewhat impatiently resented a suggestion
from me saying These young men are on the threshold of life and the
very best that is within me is due to them I can give to them only such
a message as I would were I to stand before judgment on the morrow It
was with just this spirit that the author wrote Their Yesterdays

Following Their Yesterdays the next book in order of publication was
The Eyes of the World published in the fall of 1914 It was written
in the same arrowweed study on Tecolote Rancho in the Imperial Valley
where he wrote The Calling of Dan Matthews and The Winning of Barbara
Worth Being fully in sympathy with the authors purpose in writing
this story the campaign of advertising was of such educational
character and so eventful in many ways that it will long be remembered
by authors publishers and reading public and we trust make for
cleaner books and pictures

As it was in the writing of The Calling of Dan Matthews so it was in
the writing of The Eyes of the World the sense of duty stood highest
The modern trend in books and music and art and drama had so incensed
the author that The Eyes of the World was the result of his all
impelling desire for cleaner living and thinking As is true of all
writers there are sometimes those who fail to catch the message in
Mr Wrights books He is occasionally misunderstood and that was
especially true with The Eyes of the World To the great majority
of people clean living and thinking the message was not to be
misinterpreted and to them the book is blessed To that small minority
it was convicting and from a few such it brought forth condemnation
which in a fellow author here and there was pronounced and emphasized
by envy and jealousy To critics of this class Mr Wright makes no reply
and is not in the least disturbed

The Uncrowned King a small volumean allegorypublished in 1910
to me is one of the most delightful of Mr Wrights books Possibly
it has an added charm because of certain peculiar conditions It was
written in Redlands California during the winter of 190910 although
the notion for the little volume occurred to the author while living in
Kansas City It was one of those times when the longing and will to do
a work greater than the physical would permit seemed almost overpowering
when unconsciously coming to his aid a young woman talking to a
company of Christian Endeavorers chanced to remark After all the
real kings of earth are seldom crowned All through the evening service
thoughts that this inspired kept running through the authors mind and
late that same night he wrote the outline which was only completed some
years later and given to his publishers to enrich the world

His first four novels in order of publication have been dramatized
and enjoyed by thousands from before the footlights and it has been a
delight to renew acquaintances with old friends in this way It remained
for The Eyes of the World to be the first of his books to be presented
in a feature production of motion pictures

The likes and dislikes of Harold Bell Wright are quite pronounced He is
unpretending cares not for the limelight and avoids interviews for the
public press Loud boisterous conversation is but little less offensive
to him than vulgarity in speech or action His friends are strong
cleanminded men who are doing things in the world and are as necessary
to his being as the air to his existence and his generosity to them is
no less marked than his caring and providing for his family which is
almost a passion He is extremely fond of most forms of outdoor life
The desert with its vast expanse fierce solitude and varied colors is
no less attractive to him than the peaceful quiet of wooded dells the
beauty of flowering meadows or the rugged mountains with their roaring
trout streams that furnish him hours of sport with rod and line He
enjoys hunting horseback riding or long tramps afoot But when there
is work to be done it is the one thing that bulks largest and all else
must wait

After finishing The Eyes of the World Mr Wright embarked on the
building of a home in the Santa Monica mountains near Hollywood
California So in the summer of 1915 the little family of five
began making their residence in the new canyon home one of natures
delightful spots

Then again the author went into camp in the Arizona desert while
writing When a Mans a Man For he finds it very helpful to live in
the atmosphere of his story while doing the actual writing and he also
avoids frequent interruption I think he got more real enjoyment out
of this story than any he has previously done It is a story of the
outofdoors in this great unfenced land where a man must be a man I
suppose too he enjoyed writing this work so much partly because it
comes so easy for him to just tell a story without the intervention of
some nerve racking problem The only book he has heretofore written that
is purely a story is The Shepherd of the Hills and I sometimes wonder
to what proportion of his readers does this Ozark story hold first
place For all such I am sure When a Mans a Man will find a
reception of special heartiness because it is just a fine big
wholesome novel of simple sweetness and virile strength

I have written this sketch of Harold Bell Wright that you may know him
as intimately if possible as if you had met him in person But should
you have the opportunity of making his acquaintance do not deny yourself
the pleasure If you are a lover of his books I am sure you are just the
kind of person that the author himself delights to meet
