CHAPTER I


Come in said the editor

The door of the editorial room of the Excelsior Magazine began to
creak painfully under the hesitating pressure of an uncertain and
unfamiliar hand This continued until with a start of irritation the
editor faced directly about throwing his leg over the arm of his chair
with a certain youthful dexterity With one hand gripping its back
the other still grasping a proofslip and his pencil in his mouth he
stared at the intruder

The stranger despite his hesitating entrance did not seem in the least
disconcerted He was a tall man looking even taller by reason of the
long formless overcoat he wore known as a duster and by a long
straight beard that depended from his chin which he combed with two
reflective fingers as he contemplated the editor The red dust which
still lay in the creases of his garment and in the curves of his soft
felt hat and left a dusty circle like a precipitated halo around his
feet proclaimed him if not a countryman a recent inland importation
by coach Busy he said in a grave but pleasant voice I kin wait
Dont mind ME Go on

The editor indicated a chair with his disengaged hand and plunged again
into his proofslips The stranger surveyed the scant furniture and
appointments of the office with a look of grave curiosity and then
taking a chair fixed an earnest penetrating gaze on the editors
profile The editor felt it and without looking up said

Well go on

But youre busy I kin wait

I shall not be less busy this morning I can listen

I want you to give me the name of a certain person who writes in your
magazine

The editors eye glanced at the second righthand drawer of his desk
It did not contain the names of his contributors but what in the
traditions of his office was accepted as an equivalenta revolver
He had never yet presented either to an inquirer But he laid aside his
proofs and with a slight darkening of his youthful discontented face
said What do you want to know for

The question was so evidently unexpected that the strangers face
colored slightly and he hesitated The editor meanwhile without
taking his eyes from the man mentally ran over the contents of the last
magazine They had been of a singularly peaceful character There seemed
to be nothing to justify homicide on his part or the strangers Yet
there was no knowing and his questioners bucolic appearance by no
means precluded an assault Indeed it had been a legend of the office
that a predecessor had suffered vicariously from a geological hammer
covertly introduced into a scientific controversy by an irate professor

As we make ourselves responsible for the conduct of the magazine
continued the young editor with mature severity we do not give up the
names of our contributors If you do not agree with their opinions

But I DO said the stranger with his former composure and I reckon
thats why I want to know who wrote those verses called Underbrush
signed White Violet in your last number Theyre powful pretty

The editor flushed slightly and glanced instinctively around for any
unexpected witness of his ludicrous mistake The fear of ridicule was
uppermost in his mind and he was more relieved at his mistake not being
overheard than at its groundlessness

The verses ARE pretty he said recovering himself with a critical
air and I am glad you like them But even then you know I could not
give you the ladys name without her permission I will write to her and
ask it if you like

The actual fact was that the verses had been sent to him anonymously
from a remote village in the Coast Rangethe address being the
postoffice and the signature initials

The stranger looked disturbed Then she aint about here anywhere he
said with a vague gesture She dont belong to the office

The young editor beamed with tolerant superiority No I am sorry to
say

I should like to have got to see her and kinder asked her a
few questions continued the stranger with the same reflective
seriousness You see it wasnt just the rhymin o them versesand
they kinder sing themselves to ye dont theyit wasnt the chyce o
wordsand I reckon they allus hit the idee in the centre shot every
timeit wasnt the idees and moral she sort o drew out o what she
was tellinbut it was the straight thing itselfthe truth

The truth repeated the editor

Yes sir Ive bin there Ive seen all that shes seen in the
brushthe little flicks and checkers o light and shadder down in
the brown dust that you wonder how it ever got through the dark of the
woods and that allus seems to slip away like a snake or a lizard if you
grope Ive heard all that shes heard therethe creepin the sighin
and the whisperin through the bracken and the groundvines of all that
lives there

You seem to be a poet yourself said the editor with a patronizing
smile

Im a lumberman up in Mendocino returned the stranger with sublime
naivete Got a mill there You see sightin standin timber and
selectin from the genral show of the trees in the ground and the lay
of roots hez sorter made me take notice He paused Then he added
somewhat despondingly you dont know who she is

No said the editor reflectively not even if it is really a WOMAN
who writes

Eh

Well you see White Violet may as well be the nom de plume of a man
as of a woman especially if adopted for the purpose of mystification
The handwriting I remember WAS more boyish than feminine

No returned the stranger doggedly it wasnt no MAN Theres ideas
and words there that only come from a woman babytalk to the birds you
know and a kind of fearsome keer of bugs and creepin things that dont
come to a man who wears boots and trousers Well he added with a
return to his previous air of resigned disappointment I suppose you
dont even know what shes like

No responded the editor cheerfully Then following an idea
suggested by the odd mingling of sentiment and shrewd perception in
the man before him he added Probably not at all like anything you
imagine She may be a mother with three or four children or an old maid
who keeps a boardinghouse or a wrinkled schoolmistress or a chit
of a schoolgirl Ive had some fair verses from a redhaired girl of
fourteen at the Seminary he concluded with professional coolness

The stranger regarded him with the naive wonder of an inexperienced
man Having paid this tribute to his superior knowledge he regained his
previous air of grave perception I reckon she aint none of them But
Im keepin you from your work Goodby My names BowersJim Bowers
of Mendocino If youre up my way give me a call And if you do write
to this yer White Violet and shes willin send me her address

He shook the editors hand warmlyeven in its literal significance
of imparting a good deal of his own earnest caloric to the editors
fingersand left the room His footfall echoed along the passage and
died out and with it I fear all impression of his visit from the
editors mind as he plunged again into the silent task before him

Presently he was conscious of a melodious humming and a light leisurely
step at the entrance of the hall They continued on in an easy harmony
and unaffected as the passage of a bird Both were pleasant and both
familiar to the editor They belonged to Jack Hamlin by vocation a
gambler by taste a musician on his way from his apartments on
the upper floor where he had just risen to drop into his friends
editorial room and glance over the exchanges as was his habit before
breakfast

The door opened lightly The editor was conscious of a faint odor of
scented soap a sensation of freshness and cleanliness the impression
of a soft hand like a womans on his shoulder and like a womans
momentarily and playfully caressing the passage of a graceful shadow
across his desk and the next moment Jack Hamlin was ostentatiously
dusting a chair with an open newspaper preparatory to sitting down

You ought to ship that officeboy of yours if he cant keep things
cleaner he said suspending his melody to eye grimly the dust which
Mr Bowers had shaken from his departing feet

The editor did not look up until he had finished revising a difficult
paragraph By that time Mr Hamlin had comfortably settled himself on
a cane sofa and possibly out of deference to his surroundings had
subdued his song to a peculiarly low soft and heartbreaking whistle as
he unfolded a newspaper Clean and faultless in his appearance he had
the rare gift of being able to get up at two in the afternoon with
much of the dewy freshness and all of the moral superiority of an early
riser

You ought to have been here just now Jack said the editor

Not a row old man eh inquired Jack with a faint accession of
interest

No said the editor smiling Then he related the incidents of the
previous interview with a certain humorous exaggeration which was part
of his nature But Jack did not smile

You ought to have booted him out of the ranch on sight he said What
right had he to come here prying into a ladys affairsat least a lady
as far as HE knows Of course shes some old blowzy with frumpled hair
trying to rope in a greenhorn with a string of words and phrases
concluded Jack carelessly who had an equally cynical distrust of the
sex and of literature

Thats about what I told him said the editor

Thats just what you SHOULDNT have told him returned Jack You
ought to have stuck up for that woman as if shed been your own mother
Lord you fellows dont know how to run a magazine You ought to let ME
sit on that chair and tackle your customers

What would you have done Jack asked the editor much amused to
find that his hitherto invincible hero was not above the ordinary human
weakness of offering advice as to editorial conduct

Done reflected Jack Well first sonny I shouldnt keep a revolver
in a drawer that I had to OPEN to get at

But what would you have said

I should simply have asked him what was the price of lumber at
Mendocino said Jack sweetly and when he told me I should have said
that the samples he was offering out of his own head wouldnt suit You
see you dont want any trifling in such matters You write well enough
my boy continued he turning over his paper but what youre lacking
in is editorial dignity But go on with your work Dont mind me

Thus admonished the editor again bent over his desk and his friend
softly took up his suspended song The editor had not proceeded far in
his corrections when Jacks voice again broke the silence

Where are those dd verses anyway

Without looking up the editor waved his pencil towards an uncut copy of
the Excelsior Magazine lying on the table

You dont suppose Im going to READ them do you said Jack
aggrievedly Why dont you say what theyre about Thats your business
as editor

But that functionary now wholly lost and wandering in the nonsequitur
of an involved passage in the proof before him only waved an impatient
remonstrance with his pencil and knit his brows Jack with a sigh took
up the magazine

A long silence followed broken only by the hurried rustling of sheets
of copy and an occasional exasperated start from the editor The sun
was already beginning to slant a dusty beam across his desk Jacks
whistling had long since ceased Presently with an exclamation of
relief the editor laid aside the last proofsheet and looked up

Jack Hamlin had closed the magazine but with one hand thrown over the
back of the sofa he was still holding it his slim forefinger between
its leaves to keep the place and his handsome profile and dark
lashes lifted towards the window The editor smiling at this unwonted
abstraction said quietly

Well what do you think of them

Jack rose laid the magazine down settled his white waistcoat with both
hands and lounged towards his friend with audacious but slightly
veiled and shining eyes They sort of sing themselves to you he said
quietly leaning beside the editors desk and looking down upon him
After a pause he said Then you dont know what shes like

Thats what Mr Bowers asked me remarked the editor

Dn Bowers

I suppose you also wish me to write and ask for permission to give you
her address said the editor with great gravity

No said Jack coolly I propose to give it to YOU within a week and
you will pay me with a breakfast I should like to have it said that I
was once a paid contributor to literature If I dont give it to you
Ill stand you a dinner thats all

Done said the editor And you know nothing of her now

No said Jack promptly Nor you

No more than I have told you

Thatll do So long And Jack carefully adjusting his glossy hat over
his curls at an ominously wicked angle sauntered lightly from the room
The editor glancing after his handsome figure and hearing him take
up his pretermitted whistle as he passed out began to think that the
contingent dinner was by no means an inevitable prospect

Howbeit he plunged once more into his monotonous duties But the
freshness of the day seemed to have departed with Jack and the
later interruptions of foreman and publisher were of a more practical
character It was not until the post arrived that the superscription on
one of the letters caught his eye and revived his former interest
It was the same hand as that of his unknown contributors
manuscriptillformed and boyish He opened the envelope It contained
another poem with the same signature but also a notemuch longer than
the brief lines that accompanied the first contributionwas scrawled
upon a separate piece of paper This the editor opened first and read
the following with an amazement that for the moment dominated all other
sense


MR EDITORI see you have got my poetry in But I dont see the
spondulix that oughter follow Perhaps you dont know where to send it
Then Ill tell you Send the money to Lock Box 47 Green Springs P
O per Wells Fargos Express and Ill get it there on account of my
parents not knowing Were very hightoned and they would think its
low making poetry for papers Send amount usually paid for poetry in
your papers Or may be you think I make poetry for nothing Thats where
you slip up

Yours truly

WHITE VIOLET

P SIf you dont pay for poetry send this back Its as good as what
you did put in and is just as hard to make You hear me thats meall
the time

WHITE VIOLET


The editor turned quickly to the new contribution for some corroboration
of what he felt must be an extraordinary blunder But no The few lines
that he hurriedly read breathed the same atmosphere of intellectual
repose gentleness and imagination as the first contribution And yet
they were in the same handwriting as the singular missive and both were
identical with the previous manuscript

Had he been the victim of a hoax and were the verses not original No
they were distinctly original local in color and even local in the use
of certain old English words that were common in the Southwest He had
before noticed the apparent incongruity of the handwriting and the text
and it was possible that for the purposes of disguise the poet might
have employed an amanuensis But how could he reconcile the incongruity
of the mercenary and slangy purport of the missive itself with the
mental habit of its author Was it possible that these inconsistent
qualities existed in the one individual He smiled grimly as he thought
of his visitor Bowers and his friend Jack He was startled as he
remembered the purely imaginative picture he had himself given to the
seriously interested Bowers of the possible incongruous personality of
the poetess

Was he quite fair in keeping this from Jack Was it really honorable in
view of their wager It is to be feared that a very human enjoyment of
Jacks possible discomfiture quite as much as any chivalrous friendship
impelled the editor to ring eventually for the officeboy

See if Mr Hamlin is in his rooms

The editor then sat down and wrote rapidly as follows


DEAR MADAMYou are as right as you are generous in supposing that
only ignorance of your address prevented the manager from previously
remitting the honorarium for your beautiful verses He now begs to send
it to you in the manner you have indicated As the verses have attracted
deserved attention I have been applied to for your address Should
you care to submit it to me to be used at my discretion I shall feel
honored by your confidence But this is a matter left entirely to your
own kindness and better judgment Meantime I take pleasure in accepting
White Violets present contribution and remain dear madam your
obedient servant

THE EDITOR


The boy returned as he was folding the letter Mr Hamlin was not only
NOT in his rooms but according to his negro servant Pete had left
town an hour ago for a few days in the country

Did he say where asked the editor quickly

No sir he didnt know

Very well Take this to the manager He addressed the letter and
scrawling a few hieroglyphics on a memorandumtag tore it off and
handed it with the letter to the boy

An hour later he stood in the managers office The next number is
pretty well made up he said carelessly and I think of taking a day
or two off

Certainly said the manager It will do you good Where do you think
youll go

I havent quite made up my mind


CHAPTER II


Hullo said Jack Hamlin

He had halted his mare at the edge of an abrupt chasm It did not appear
to be fifty feet across yet its depth must have been nearly two
hundred to where the hidden mountainstream of which it was the banks
alternately slipped tumbled and fell with murmuring and monotonous
regularity One or two pinetrees growing on the opposite edge loosened
at the roots had tilted their straight shafts like spears over the
abyss and the top of one resting on the upper branches of a sycamore a
few yards from him served as an aerial bridge for the passage of a boy
of fourteen to whom Mr Hamlins challenge was addressed

The boy stopped midway in his perilous transit and looking down upon
the horseman responded coolly Hullo yourself

Is that the only way across this infernal hole or the one you prefer
for exercise continued Hamlin gravely

The boy sat down on a bough allowing his bare feet to dangle over the
dizzy depths and critically examined his questioner Jack had on this
occasion modified his usual correct conventional attire by a tasteful
combination of a vaqueros costume and in loose white bullionfringed
trousers red sash jacket and sombrero looked infinitely more dashing
and picturesque than his original Nevertheless the boy did not reply
Mr Hamlins pride in his usual ascendency over women children horses
and all unreasoning animals was deeply nettled He smiled however and
said quietly

Come here George Washington I want to talk to you

Without rejecting this august yet impossible title the boy presently
lifted his feet and carelessly resumed his passage across the
chasm until reaching the sycamore he began to let himself down
squirrelwise leap by leap with an occasional trapeze swinging from
bough to bough dropping at last easily to the ground Here he appeared
to be rather goodlooking albeit the sun and air had worked a miracle
of brown tan and freckles on his exposed surfaces until the mottling of
his oval cheeks looked like a polished birds egg Indeed it struck Mr
Hamlin that he was as intensely a part of that sylvan seclusion as
the hidden brook that murmured the brown velvet shadows that lay like
trappings on the white flanks of his horse the quivering heat and the
stinging spice of bay Mr Hamlin had vague ideas of dryads and fauns
but at that moment would have bet something on the chances of their
survival

I did not hear what you said just now general he remarked with
great elegance of manner but I know from your reputation that it could
not be a lie I therefore gather that there IS another way across

The boy smiled rather his very short upper lip apparently vanished
completely over his white teeth and his very black eyes which showed a
great deal of the white around them danced in their orbits

But YOU couldnt find it he said slyly

No more could you find the halfdollar I dropped just now unless I
helped you

Mr Hamlin by way of illustration leaned deeply over his left stirrup
and pointed to the ground At the same moment a bright halfdollar
absolutely appeared to glitter in the herbage at the point of his
finger It was a trick that had always brought great pleasure and profit
to his young friends and some loss and discomfiture of wager to his
older ones

The boy picked up the coin Theres a dip and a level crossing about a
mile over yerhe pointedbut its through the woods and theyre
that high with thick bresh

With what

Bresh repeated the boy THATpointing to a few fronds of bracken
growing in the shadow of the sycamore

Oh underbrush

Yes I said bresh returned the boy doggedly YOU might get
through ef you war spry but not your hoss Where do you want to go
anyway

Do you know George said Mr Hamlin lazily throwing his right
leg over the horn of his saddle for greater ease and deliberation in
replying its very odd but thats just what ID like to know Now
what would YOU in your broad statesmanlike views of things generally
advise

Quite convinced of the strangers mental unsoundness the boy glanced
again at his halfdollar as if to make sure of its integrity pocketed
it doubtfully and turned away

Where are you going said Hamlin resuming his seat with the agility
of a circusrider and spurring forward

To Green Springs where I live two miles over the ridge on the far
slopeindicating the direction

Ah said Jack with thoughtful gravity Well kindly give my love to
your sister will you

George Washington didnt have no sister said the boy cunningly

Can I have been mistaken said Hamlin lifting his hand to his
forehead with grieved accents Then it seems YOU have Kindly give her
my love

Which one asked the boy with a swift glance of mischief Ive got
four

The one thats like you returned Hamlin with prompt exactitude
Now wheres the bresh you spoke of

Keep along the edge until you come to the logslide Foller that and
itll lead you into the woods But ye wont go far I tell ye When you
have to turn back instead o comin back here you kin take the trail
that goes round the woods and thatll bring ye out into the stage road
agin near the postoffice at the Green Springs crossin and the new
hotel Thatll be war yell turn up I reckon he added reflectively
Fellers that come yer gunnin and fishin ginrally do he concluded
with a halfinquisitive air

Ah said Mr Hamlin quietly shedding the inquiry Green Springs
Hotel is where the stage stops eh

Yes and at the postoffice said the boy Shell be along here
soon he added

If you mean the Santa Cruz stage said Hamlin shes here already I
passed her on the ridge half an hour ago

The boy gave a sudden start and a quick uneasy expression passed over
his face Go long with ye he said with a forced smile it aint
her time yet

But I SAW her repeated Hamlin much amused Are you expecting
company Hullo Where are you off to Come back

But his companion had already vanished in the thicket with the
undeliberate and impulsive act of an animal There was a momentary
rustle in the alders fifty feet away and then all was silent The
hidden brook took up its monotonous murmur the tapping of a distant
woodpecker became suddenly audible and Mr Hamlin was again alone

Wonder whether hes got parents in the stage and has been playing
truant here he mused lazily Looked as if hed been up to some
devilment or more like as if he was primed for it If hed been a
little older Id have bet he was in league with some roadagents to
watch the coach Just my luck to have him light out as I was beginning
to get some talk out of him He paused looked at his watch and
straightened himself in his stirrups Four oclock I reckon I might as
well try the woods and what that imp calls the bresh I may strike a
shanty or a native by the way

With this determination Mr Hamlin urged his horse along the faint
trail by the brink of the watercourse which the boy had just indicated
He had no definite end in view beyond the one that had brought him the
day before to that localityhis quest of the unknown poetess His clue
would have seemed to ordinary humanity the faintest He had merely
noted the provincial name of a certain plant mentioned in the poem and
learned that its habitat was limited to the southern local range while
its peculiar nomenclature was clearly of French Creole or Gulf State
origin This gave him a large though sparselypopulated area
for locality while it suggested a settlement of Louisianians or
Mississippians near the Summit of whom through their native gambling
proclivities he was professionally cognizant But he mainly trusted
Fortune Secure in his faith in the feminine character of that goddess
he relied a great deal on her wellknown weakness for scamps of his
quality

It was not long before he came to the slidea lightlycut or shallow
ditch It descended slightly in a course that was far from straight at
times diverging to avoid the obstacles of trees or boulders at times
shaving them so closely as to leave smooth abrasions along their sides
made by the grinding passage of long logs down the incline The track
itself was slippery from this and preoccupied all Hamlins skill as a
horseman even to the point of stopping his usual careless whistle
At the end of half an hour the track became level again and he was
confronted with a singular phenomenon

He had entered the wood and the trail seemed to cleave through a
farstretching motionless sea of ferns that flowed on either side to
the height of his horses flanks The straight shafts of the trees rose
like columns from their hidden bases and were lost again in a roof
of impenetrable leafage leaving a clear space of fifty feet between
through which the surrounding horizon of sky was perfectly visible
All the light that entered this vast sylvan hall came from the sides
nothing permeated from above nothing radiated from below the height
of the crest on which the wood was placed gave it this lateral
illumination but gave it also the profound isolation of some temple
raised by longforgotten hands In spite of the height of these clear
shafts they seemed dwarfed by the expanse of the wood and in the
farthest perspective the base of ferns and the capital of foliage
appeared almost to meet As the boy had warned him the slide had turned
aside skirting the wood to follow the incline and presently the little
trail he now followed vanished utterly leaving him and his horse adrift
breasthigh in this green and yellow sea of fronds But Mr Hamlin
imperious of obstacles and touched by some curiosity continued to
advance lazily taking the bearings of a larger redwood in the centre
of the grove for his objective point The elastic mass gave way before
him brushing his knees or combing his horses flanks with widespread
elfin fingers and closing up behind him as he passed as if to
obliterate any track by which he might return Yet his usual luck did
not desert him here Being on horseback he found that he could detect
what had been invisible to the boy and probably to all pedestrians
namely that the growth was not equally dense that there were certain
thinner and more open spaces that he could take advantage of by more
circuitous progression always however keeping the bearings of the
central tree This he at last reached and halted his panting horse
Here a new idea which had been haunting him since he entered the wood
took fuller possession of him He had seen or known all this before
There was a strange familiarity either in these objects or in the
impression or spell they left upon him He remembered the verses Yes
this was the underbrush which the poetess had described the gloom
above and below the light that seemed blown through it like the wind
the suggestion of hidden life beneath this tangled luxuriance which she
alone had penetratedall this was here But more than that here was
the atmosphere that she had breathed into the plaintive melody of her
verse It did not necessarily follow that Mr Hamlins translation of
her sentiment was the correct one or that the ideas her verses had
provoked in his mind were at all what had been hers in his easy
susceptibility he was simply thrown into a corresponding mood of
emotion and relieved himself with song One of the verses he had already
associated in his mind with the rhythm of an old plantation melody and
it struck his fancy to take advantage of the solitude to try its effect
Humming to himself at first softly he at last grew bolder and let his
voice drift away through the stark pillars of the sylvan colonnade till
it seemed to suffuse and fill it with no more effort than the light
which strayed in on either side Sitting thus his hat thrown a little
back from his clustering curls the white neck and shoulders of his
horse uplifting him above the crested mass of fern his red sash the one
fleck of color in their olive depths I am afraid he looked much
more like the real minstrel of the grove than the unknown poetess who
transfigured it But this as has been already indicated was Jack
Hamlins peculiar gift Even as he had previously outshone the vaquero
in his borrowed dress he now silenced and supplanted a few fluttering
bluejaysrightful tenants of the woodwith a more graceful and airy
presence and a far sweeter voice

The open horizon towards the west had taken a warmer color from the
already slanting sun when Mr Hamlin having rested his horse turned
to that direction He had noticed that the wood was thinner there
and pushing forward he was presently rewarded by the sound of faroff
wheels and knew he must be near the highroad that the boy had spoken
of Having given up his previous intention of crossing the stream there
seemed nothing better for him to do than to follow the truants advice
and take the road back to Green Springs Yet he was loath to leave the
wood halting on its verge and turning to look back into its charmed
recesses Once or twiceperhaps because he recalled the words of the
poemthat yellowish sea of ferns had seemed instinct with hidden life
and he had even fancied here and there a swaying of its plumed crests
Howbeit he still lingered long enough for the open sunlight into which
he had obtruded to point out the bravery of his handsome figure Then
he wheeled his horse the light glanced from polished double bit and
bridlefripperies caught his red sash and bullion buttons struck a
parting flash from his silver spurs and he was gone

For a moment the light streamed unbrokenly through the wood And then
it could be seen that the yellow mass of undergrowth HAD moved with the
passage of another figure than his own For ever since he had entered
the shade a woman shawled in a vague shapeless fashion had watched
him wonderingly eagerly excitedly gliding from tree to tree as he
advanced or else dropping breathlessly below the fronds of fern whence
she gazed at him as between parted fingers When he wheeled she had run
openly to the west albeit with hidden face and still clinging shawl
and taken a last look at his retreating figure And then with a faint
but lingering sigh she drew back into the shadow of the wood again and
vanished also


CHAPTER III


At the end of twenty minutes Mr Hamlin reined in his mare He had just
observed in the distant shadows of a bylane that intersected his road
the vanishing flutter of two light print dresses Without a moments
hesitation he lightly swerved out of the highroad and followed the
retreating figures

As he neared them they seemed to be two slim young girls evidently
so preoccupied with the rustic amusement of edging each other off the
grassy border into the dust of the track that they did not perceive
his approach Little shrieks slight scufflings and interjections of
Cynthy you limb Quit that Eunice now and I just call that
real mean apparently drowned the sound of his canter in the soft dust
Checking his speed to a gentle trot and pressing his horse close beside
the opposite fence he passed them with gravely uplifted hat and a
serious preoccupied air But in that single seemingly conventional
glance Mr Hamlin had seen that they were both pretty and that one had
the short upper lip of his errant little guide A hundred yards farther
on he halted as if irresolutely gazed doubtfully ahead of him and
then turned back An expression of innocentalmost childlikeconcern
was clouding the rascals face It was well as the two girls had drawn
closely together having been apparently surprised in the midst of a
glowing eulogium of this glorious passing vision by its sudden return
At his nearer approach the one with the short upper lip hid that
piquant feature and the rest of her rosy face behind the others
shoulder which was suddenly and significantly opposed to the advance
of this handsome intruder with a certain dignity half real half
affected but wholly charming The protectress appearedpossibly from
her defensive attitudethe superior of her companion

Audacious as Jack was to his own sex he had early learned that
such rare but discomposing graces as he possessed required a certain
apologetic attitude when presented to women and that it was only a
plain man who could be always complacently selfconfident in their
presence There was consequently a hesitating lowering of this
hypocrites brown eyelashes as he said in almost pained accents

Excuse me but I fear Ive taken the wrong road Im going to Green
Springs

I reckon youve taken the wrong road wherever youre going returned
the young lady having apparently made up her mind to resent each of
Jacks perfections as a separate impertinence this is a PRIVATE road
She drew herself fairly up here although gurgled at in the ear and
pinched in the arm by her companion

I beg your pardon said Jack meekly I see Im trespassing on your
grounds Im very sorry Thank you for telling me I should have gone on
a mile or two farther I suppose until I came to your house he added
innocently

A mile or two Youd have run chock agin our gate in another minit
said the shortlipped one eagerly But a sharp nudge from her companion
sent her back again into cover where she waited expectantly for another
crushing retort from her protector

But alas it did not come One cannot be always witty and Jack looked
distressed Nevertheless he took advantage of the pause

It was so stupid in me as I think your brotherlooking at
Shortlipvery carefully told me the road

The two girls darted quick glances at each other Oh Bawb said the
first speaker in wearied accentsTHAT limb He dont keer

But he DID care said Hamlin quietly and gave me a good deal of
information Thanks to him I was able to see that ferny wood thats so
famousabout two miles up the road You knowthe one that theres a
poem written about

The shot told Shortlip burst into a display of dazzling little teeth
and caught the other girl convulsively by the shoulders The superior
girl bent her pretty brows and said Eunice whats gone of ye Quit
that but as Hamlin thought paled slightly

Of course said Hamlin quickly you knowthe poem everybodys
talking about Dear me let me see how does it go The rascal knit his
brows said Ah yes and then murmured the verse he had lately sung
quite as musically

Shortlip was shamelessly exalted and excited Really she could scarcely
believe it She already heard herself relating the whole occurrence
Here was the most beautiful young man she had ever seenan entire
strangertalking to them in the most beautiful and natural way
right in the lane and reciting poetry to her sister It was like a
novelonly more so She thought that Cynthia on the other hand looked
distressed andshe must say itsilly

All of which Jack noted and was wise He had got all he wantedat
present He gathered up his reins

Thank you so much and your brother too Miss Cynthia he said
without looking up Then adding with a parting glance and smile But
dont tell Bob how stupid I was he swiftly departed

In half an hour he was at the Green Springs Hotel As he rode into the
stable yard he noticed that the coach had only just arrived having
been detained by a landslip on the Summit road With the recollection
of Bob fresh in his mind he glanced at the loungers at the stage
office The boy was not there but a moment later Jack detected him
among the waiting crowd at the postoffice opposite With a view of
following up his inquiries he crossed the road as the boy entered the
vestibule of the postoffice He arrived in time to see him unlock one
of a row of numbered letterboxes rented by subscribers which occupied
a partition by the window and take out a small package and a letter
But in that brief glance Mr Hamlin detected the printed address of the
Excelsior Magazine on the wrapper It was enough Luck was certainly
with him

He had time to get rid of the wicked sparkle that had lit his dark eyes
and to lounge carelessly towards the boy as the latter broke open the
package and then hurriedly concealed it in his jacketpocket and
started for the door Mr Hamlin quickly followed him unperceived and
as he stepped into the street gently tapped him on the shoulder The
boy turned and faced him quickly But Mr Hamlins eyes showed nothing
but lazy goodhumor

Hullo Bob Where are you going

The boy again looked up suspiciously at this revelation of his name

Home he said briefly

Oh over yonder said Hamlin calmly I dont mind walking with you
as far as the lane

He saw the boys eyes glance furtively towards an alley that ran beside
the blacksmiths shop a few rods ahead and was convinced that he
intended to evade him there Slipping his arm carelessly in the youths
he concluded to open fire at once

Bob he said with irresistible gravity I did not know when I met
you this morning that I had the honor of addressing a poetnone other
than the famous author of Underbrush

The boy started back and endeavored to withdraw his arm but Mr Hamlin
tightened his hold without however changing his careless expression

You see he continued the editor is a friend of mine and being
afraid this package might not get into the right handsas you didnt
give your namehe deputized me to come here and see that it was all
square As youre rather young for all youre so gifted I reckon Id
better go home with you and take a receipt from your parents Thats
about square I think

The consternation of the boy was so evident and so far beyond Mr
Hamlins expectation that he instantly halted him gazed into his
shifting eyes and gave a long whistle

Who said it was for ME Wot you talkin about Lemme go gasped the
boy with the short intermittent breath of mingled fear and passion

Bob said Mr Hamlin in a singularly colorless voice which was very
rare with him and an expression quite unlike his own what is your
little game

The boy looked down in dogged silence

Out with it Who are you playing this on

Its all among my own folks its nothin to YOU said the boy
suddenly beginning to struggle violently as if inspired by this
extenuating fact

Among your own folks eh White Violet and the rest eh But SHES not
in it

No reply

Hand me over that package Ill give it back to you again

The boy handed it to Mr Hamlin He read the letter and found the
inclosure contained a twentydollar goldpiece A halfsupercilious
smile passed over his face at this revelation of the inadequate
emoluments of literature and the trifling inducements to crime Indeed
I fear the affair began to take a less serious moral complexion in his
eyes

Then White Violetyour sister Cynthia you know continued Mr
Hamlin in easy parenthesiswrote for this holding the coin
contemplatively in his fingers and you calculated to nab it yourself

The quick searching glance with which Bob received the name of his
sister Mr Hamlin attributed only to his natural surprise that
this stranger should be on such familiar terms with her but the boy
responded immediately and bluntly

No SHE didnt write for it She didnt want nobody to know who she
was Nobody wrote for it but me Nobody KNEW FOLKS WAS PAID FOR POTRY
BUT ME I found it out from a feller I wrote for it I wasnt goin to
let that skunk of an editor have it himself

And you thought YOU would take it said Hamlin his voice resuming
its old tone Well GeorgeI mean Bob your conduct was praiseworthy
although your intentions were bad Still twenty dollars is rather
too much for your trouble Suppose we say five and call it square He
handed the astonished boy five dollars Now George Washington he
continued taking four other twentydollar pieces from his pocket and
adding them to the inclosure which he carefully refolded Im going to
give you another chance to live up to your reputation Youll take that
package and hand it to White Violet and say you found it just as
it is in the lockbox Ill keep the letter for it would knock you
endways if it was seen and Ill make it all right with the editor But
as Ive got to tell him that Ive seen White Violet myself and know
shes got it I expect YOU to manage in some way to have me see her
Ill manage the rest of it and I wont blow on you either Youll
come back to the hotel and tell me what youve done And now George
concluded Mr Hamlin succeeding at last in fixing the boys evasive eye
with a peculiar look it may be just as well for you to understand
that I know every nook and corner of this place that Ive already been
through that underbrush you spoke of once this morning and that Ive
got a mare that can go wherever YOU can and a dd sight quicker

Ill give the package to White Violet said the boy doggedly

And youll come back to the hotel

The boy hesitated and then said Ill come back

All right then Adios general

Bob disappeared around the corner of a crossroad at a rapid trot and
Mr Hamlin turned into the hotel

Smart little chap that he said to the barkeeper

You bet returned the man who having recognized Mr Hamlin was
delighted at the prospect of conversing with a gentleman of such
decidedly dangerous reputation But hes been allowed to run a little
wild since old man Delatour died and the widders got enough to do I
reckon lookin arter her four gals and takin keer of old Delatours
ranch over yonder I guess its pretty hard sleddin for her sometimes
to get cloes and grub for the famerly without follerin Bob around

Sharp girls too I reckon one of them writes things for the
magazines doesnt sheCynthia eh said Mr Hamlin carelessly

Evidently this fact was not a notorious one to the barkeeper He
however said Dunno mabbee her father was eddicated and the widder
Delatour too though shes sorter queer Ive heard tell Lord
Mr Hamlin YOU oughter remember old man Delatour From Opelousas
Louisiany you know High old sport French style frilled
bosomopenhanded and uster buck agin faro awful Why he dropped
a heap o money to YOU over in San Jose two years ago at poker You must
remember him

The slightest possible flush passed over Mr Hamlins brow under the
shadow of his hat but did not get lower than his eyes He suddenly HAD
recalled the spendthrift Delatour perfectly and as quickly regretted
now that he had not doubled the honorarium he had just sent to his
portionless daughter But he only said coolly No and then raising
his pale face and audacious eyes continued in his laziest and most
insulting manner no the fact is my mind is just now preoccupied in
wondering if the gas is leaking anywhere and if anything is ever served
over this bar except elegant conversation When the gentleman who mixes
drinks comes back perhaps youll be good enough to tell him to send a
whisky sour to Mr Jack Hamlin in the parlor Meantime you can turn off
your soda fountain I dont want any fizz in mine

Having thus quite recovered himself Mr Hamlin lounged gracefully
across the hall into the parlor As he did so a darkish young man with
a slim boyish figure a thin face and a discontented expression
rose from an armchair held out his hand and with a saturnine smile
said

Jack

Fred

The two men remained gazing at each other with a halfamused
halfguarded expression Mr Hamlin was first to begin I didnt think
YOUD be such a fool as to try on this kind of thing Fred he said
half seriously

Yes but it was to keep you from being a much bigger one that I hunted
you up said the editor mischievously Read that I got it an hour
after you left And he placed a little triumphantly in Jacks hand the
letter he had received from White Violet

Mr Hamlin read it with an unmoved face and then laid his two hands
on the editors shoulders Yes my young friend and you sat down and
wrote her a pretty letter and sent her twenty dollarswhich permit me
to say was dd poor pay But that isnt your fault I reckon its
the meanness of your proprietors

But it isnt the question either just now Jack however you have
been able to answer it Do you mean to say seriously that you want to
know anything more of a woman who could write such a letter

I dont know said Jack cheerfully She might be a devilish sight
funnier than if she hadnt written itwhich is the fact

You mean to say SHE didnt write it

Yes

Who did then

Her brother Bob

After a moments scrutiny of his friends bewildered face Mr Hamlin
briefly related his adventures from the moment of his meeting Bob at
the mountainstream to the barkeepers gossiping comment and sequel
Therefore he concluded the author of Underbrush is Miss Cynthia
Delatour one of four daughters of a widow who lives two miles from
here at the crossing I shall see her this evening and make sure
but tomorrow morning you will pay me the breakfast you owe me Shes
goodlooking but I cant say I fancy the poetic style its a little
too hightoned for me However I love my love with a C because she is
your Contributor I hate her with a C because of her Connections I met
her by Chance and treated her with Civility her name is Cynthia and
she lives on a Crossroad

But you surely dont expect you will ever see Bob again said the
editor impatiently You have trusted him with enough to start him for
the Sandwich Islands to say nothing of the ruinous precedent you have
established in his mind of the value of poetry I am surprised that
a man of your knowledge of the world would have faith in that imp the
second time

My knowledge of the world returned Mr Hamlin sententiously tells
me thats the only way you can trust anybody ONCE doesnt make a habit
nor show a character I could see by his bungling that he had never
tried this on before Just now the temptation to wipe out his punishment
by doing the square thing and coming back a sort of hero is stronger
than any other Tisnt everybody that gets that chance he added with
an odd laugh

Nevertheless three hours passed without bringing Bob The two men had
gone to the billiardroom when a waiter brought a note which he
handed to Mr Hamlin with some apologetic hesitation It bore no
superscription but had been brought by a boy who described Mr Hamlin
perfectly and requested that the note should be handed to him with the
remark that Bob had come back

And is he there now asked Mr Hamlin holding the letter unopened in
his hand

No sir he run right off

The editor laughed but Mr Hamlin having perused the note put away
his cue Come into my room he said

The editor followed and Mr Hamlin laid the note before him on the
table Bobs all right he said for Ill bet a thousand dollars that
note is genuine

It was delicately written in a cultivated feminine hand utterly unlike
the scrawl that had first excited the editors curiosity and ran as
follows


He who brought me the bounty of your friendfor I cannot call a
recompense so far above my deserts by any other namegives me also to
understand that you wished for an interview I cannot believe that this
is mere idle curiosity or that you have any motive that is not kindly
and honorable but I feel that I must beg and pray you not to seek to
remove the veil behind which I have chosen to hide myself and my
poor efforts from identification I THINK I know youI KNOW I
know myselfwell enough to believe it would give neither of us any
happiness You will say to your generous friend that he has already
given the Unknown more comfort and hope than could come from any
personal compliment or publicity and you will yourself believe that you
have all unconsciously brightened a sad womans fancy with a Dream and a
Vision that before today had been unknown to

WHITE VIOLET


Have you read it asked Mr Hamlin

Yes

Then you dont want to see it any more or even remember you ever saw
it said Mr Hamlin carefully tearing the note into small pieces and
letting them drift from the windows like blown blossoms

But I say Jack look here I dont understand You say you have
already seen this woman and yet

I HAVENT seen her said Jack composedly turning from the window

What do you mean

I mean that you and I Fred are going to drop this fooling right here
and leave this place for Frisco by first stage tomorrow andthat I
owe you that dinner


CHAPTER IV


When the stage for San Francisco rolled away the next morning with Mr
Hamlin and the editor the latter might have recognized in the occupant
of a dustcovered buggy that was coming leisurely towards them the tall
figure long beard and straight duster of his late visitor Mr James
Bowers For Mr Bowers was on the same quest that the others had just
abandoned Like Mr Hamlin he had been left to his own resources but
Mr Bowerss resources were a lifelong experience and technical skill
he too had noted the topographical indications of the poem and his
knowledge of the sylva of Upper California pointed as unerringly as Mr
Hamlins luck to the cryptogamous haunts of the Summit Such abnormal
growths were indicative of certain localities only but as they were
not remunerative from a pecuniary point of view were to be avoided by
the sagacious woodman It was clear therefore that Mr Bowerss
visit to Green Springs was not professional and that he did not even
figuratively accept the omen

He baited and rested his horse at the hotel where his bucolic exterior
however did not elicit that attention which had been accorded to Mr
Hamlins charming insolence or the editors cultivated manner But he
glanced over a township map on the walls of the readingroom and took
note of the names of the owners of different lots farms and ranches
passing that of Delatour with the others Then he drove leisurely in the
direction of the woods and reaching them tied his horse to a young
sapling in the shade and entered their domain with a shambling but
familiar woodmans step

It is not the purpose of this brief chronicle to follow Mr Bowers in
his professional diagnosis of the locality He recognized Nature in one
of her moods of wasteful extravagancea waste that his experienced
eye could tell was also sapping the vitality of those outwardly robust
shafts that rose around him He knew without testing them that half of
these fairseeming columns were hollow and rotten at the core he could
detect the chill odor of decay through the hot balsamic spices stirred
by the wind that streamed through their long aisleslike incense
mingling with the exhalations of a crypt He stopped now and then to
part the heavy fronds down to their roots in the dank moss seeing
again as he had told the editor the weird SECOND twilight through
their miniature stems and the microcosm of life that filled it But
even while paying this tribute to the accuracy of the unknown poetess
he was like his predecessor haunted more strongly by the atmosphere
and melody of her verse Its spell was upon him too Unlike Mr Hamlin
he did not sing He only halted once or twice silently combing his
straight narrow beard with his three fingers until the action seemed
to draw down the lines of his face into limitless dejection and an
inscrutable melancholy filled his small gray eyes The few birds which
had hailed Mr Hamlin as their successful rival fled away before the
grotesque and angular halflength of Mr Bowers as if the wind had
blown in a scarecrow from the distant farms

Suddenly he observed the figure of a woman with her back towards him
leaning motionless against a tree and apparently gazing intently in the
direction of Green Springs He had approached so near to her that it
was singular she had not heard him Mr Bowers was a bashful man in the
presence of the other sex He felt exceedingly embarrassed if he could
have gone away without attracting her attention he would have done so
Neither could he remain silent a tacit spy of her meditation He had
recourse to a polite but singularly artificial cough

To his surprise she gave a faint cry turned quickly towards him and
then shrank back and lapsed quite helpless against the tree Her evident
distress overcame his bashfulness He ran towards her

Im sorry I frighted ye maam but I was afraid I might skeer ye more
if I lay low and said nothin

Even then if she had been some fair young country girl he would have
relapsed after this speech into his former bashfulness But the face and
figure she turned towards him were neither young nor fair a woman past
forty with gray threads and splashes in her brushedback hair which
was turned over her ears in two curls like frayed strands of rope Her
forehead was rather high than broad her nose large but wellshaped
and her eyes full but so singularly light in color as to seem almost
sightless The short upper lip of her large mouth displayed her teeth
in an habitual smile which was in turn so flatly contradicted by every
other line of her careworn face that it seemed gratuitously artificial
Her figure was hidden by a shapeless garment that partook equally of the
shawl cloak and wrapper

I am very foolish she began in a voice and accent that at once
asserted a cultivated woman but I so seldom meet anybody here that a
voice quite startled me That and the heat she went on wiping her
face into which the color was returning violentlyfor I seldom go out
as early as thisI suppose affected me

Mr Bowers had that innate FarWestern reverence for womanhood which
I fancy challenges the most polished politeness He remained patient
undemonstrative selfeffacing and respectful before her his angular
arm slightly but not obtrusively advanced the offer of protection being
in the act rather than in any spoken word and requiring no response

Like as not maam he said cheerfully looking everywhere but in her
burning face The sun IS powful hot at this time o day I felt it
myself comin yer and though the damp of this timber kinder sets it
back its likely to come out agin Ye cant check it no more than the
sap in that choked limb tharhe pointed ostentatiously where a fallen
pine had been caught in the bent and twisted arm of another but which
still put out a few green tassels beyond the point of impact Do you
live far from here maam he added

Only as far as the first turning below the hill

Ive got my buggy here and Im goin that way and I can jist set ye
down thar cool and comfortable Ef he continued in the same assuring
tone without waiting for a reply yell jist take a good grip of
my arm thar curving his wrist and hand behind him like a shepherds
crook Ill go first and break away the brush for ye

She obeyed mechanically and they fared on through the thick ferns in
this fashion for some moments he looking ahead occasionally dropping
a word of caution or encouragement but never glancing at her face
When they reached the buggy he lifted her into it carefullyand
perpendicularly it struck her afterwards very much as if she had been
a transplanted sapling with bared and sensitive rootsand then gravely
took his place beside her

Bein in the timber trade myself maam he said gathering up the
reins I chanced to sight these woods and took a look around My name
is Bowers of Mendocino I reckon there aint much that grows in the
way o standin timber on the Pacific Slope that I dont know and cant
locate though I DO say it Ive got ez big a mill and ez big a run in
my district ez there is anywhere Ef youre ever up my way you ask for
BowersJim Bowersand thats ME

There is probably nothing more conducive to conversation between
strangers than a wholesome and early recognition of each others
foibles Mr Bowers believing his chance acquaintance a superior woman
naively spoke of himself in a way that he hoped would reassure her
that she was not compromising herself in accepting his civility and so
satisfy what must be her inevitable pride On the other hand the woman
regained her selfpossession by this exhibition of Mr Bowerss vanity
and revived by the refreshing breeze caused by the rapid motion of the
buggy along the road thanked him graciously

I suppose there are many strangers at the Green Springs Hotel she
said after a pause

I didnt get to see em as I only put up my hoss there he replied
But I know the stage took some away this mornin it seemed pretty well
loaded up when I passed it

The woman drew a deep sigh The act struck Mr Bowers as a possible
return of her former nervous weakness Her attention must at once be
distracted at any costeven conversation

Perhaps he began with sudden and appalling lightness Im atalkin
to Mrs McFadden

No said the woman abstractedly

Then it must be Mrs Delatour There are only two township lots on that
crossroad

My name IS Delatour she said somewhat wearily

Mr Bowers was conversationally stranded He was not at all anxious to
know her name yet knowing it now it seemed to suggest that there was
nothing more to say He would of course have preferred to ask her
if she had read the poetry about the Underbrush and if she knew the
poetess and what she thought of it but the fact that she appeared
to be an eddicated woman made him sensitive of displaying technical
ignorance in his manner of talking about it She might ask him if it was
subjective or objectivetwo words he had heard used at the Debating
Society at Mendocino on the question Is poetry morally beneficial
For a few moments he was silent But presently she took the initiative
in conversation at first slowly and abstractedly and then as if
appreciating his sympathetic reticence or mayhap finding some relief
in monotonous expression talked mechanically deliberately but
unostentatiously about herself So colorless was her intonation that at
times it did not seem as if she was talking to him but repeating some
conversation she had held with another

She had lived there ever since she had been in California Her husband
had bought the Spanish title to the property when they first married
The property at his death was found to be greatly involved she had been
obliged to part with much of it to support her childrenfour girls and
a boy She had been compelled to withdraw the girls from the convent at
Santa Clara to help about the house the boy was too youngshe feared
too shiftlessto do anything The farm did not pay the land was poor
she knew nothing about farming she had been brought up in New Orleans
where her father had been a judge and she didnt understand country
life Of course she had been married too youngas all girls were
Lately she had thought of selling off and moving to San Francisco where
she would open a boardinghouse or a school for young ladies He could
advise her perhaps of some good opportunity Her own girls were far
enough advanced to assist her in teaching one particularly Cynthia
was quite clever and spoke French and Spanish fluently

As Mr Bowers was familiar with many of these counts in the feminine
American indictment of life generally he was not perhaps greatly moved
But in the last sentence he thought he saw an opening to return to his
main object and looking up cautiously said

And mebbe write potry now and then To his great discomfiture the
only effect of this suggestion was to check his companions speech for
some moments and apparently throw her back into her former abstraction
Yet after a long pause as they were turning into the lane she said
as if continuing the subject

I only hope that whatever my daughters may do they wont marry
young

The yawning breaches in the Delatour gates and fences presently came
in view They were supposed to be reinforced by half a dozen dogs
who however did their duty with what would seem to be the prevailing
inefficiency retiring after a single perfunctory yelp to shameless
stretching scratching and slumber Their places were taken on the
veranda by two negro servants two girls respectively of eight and
eleven and a boy of fourteen who remained silently staring As Mr
Bowers had accepted the widows polite invitation to enter she was
compelled albeit in an equally dazed and helpless way to issue some
preliminary orders

Now ChloeI mean aunt Dinahdo take EuniceI mean Victorine and
Unaaway andyou knowtidy them and you Sarahits Sarah isnt
itlay some refreshment in the parlor for this gentleman And
Bob tell your sister Cynthia to come here with Eunice As Bob still
remained staring at Mr Bowers she added in weary explanation Mr
Bowers brought me over from the Summit woods in his buggyit was so
hot Thereshake hands and thank him and run awaydo

They crossed a broad but scantilyfurnished hall Everywhere the same
look of hopeless incompleteness temporary utility and premature decay
most of the furniture was mismatched and misplaced many of the rooms
had changed their original functions or doubled them a smell of cooking
came from the library on whose shelves mingled with books were
dresses and household linen and through the door of a room into which
Mrs Delatour retired to remove her duster Mr Bowers caught a glimpse
of a bed and of a table covered with books and papers at which a
tall fair girl was writing In a few moments Mrs Delatour returned
accompanied by this girl and Eunice her shortlipped sister Bob who
joined the party seated around Mr Bowers and a table set with cake a
decanter and glasses completed the group Emboldened by the presence
of the tall Cynthia and his glimpse of her previous literary attitude
Mr Bowers resolved to make one more attempt

I suppose these yer young ladies sometimes go to the wood too As his
eye rested on Cynthia she replied

Oh yes

I reckon on account of the purty shadows down in the brush and the
soft light eh and all that he continued with a playful manner but a
serious accession of color

Why the woods belong to us Its mars property broke in Eunice with
a flash of teeth

Well Lordy I wanter know said Mr Bowers in some astonishment
Why thats right in my line too Ive been sightin timber all along
here and thats how I dropped in on yer mar Then seeing a look of
eagerness light up the faces of Bob and Eunice he was encouraged to
make the most of his opportunity Why maam he went on cheerfully
I reckon youre holdin that wood at a pretty stiff figger now

Why asked Mrs Delatour simply

Mr Bowers delivered a wink at Bob and Eunice who were still watching
him with anxiety Well not on account of the actool timber for the
best of it aint sound he said but on account of its bein famous
Everybody that reads that powful pretty poem about it in the Excelsior
Magazine wants to see it Why it would pay the Green Springs
hotelkeeper to buy it up for his customers But I spose you reckon to
keep italong with the poetessin your famerly

Although Mr Bowers long considered this speech as the happiest and most
brilliant effort of his life its immediate effect was not perhaps
all that could be desired The widow turned upon him a restrained and
darkening face Cynthia half rose with an appealing Oh mar and Bob
and Eunice having apparently pinched each other to the last stage of
endurance retired precipitately from the room in a prolonged giggle

I have not yet thought of disposing of the Summit woods Mr Bowers
said Mrs Delatour coldly but if I should do so I will consult you
You must excuse the children who see so little company they are quite
unmanageable when strangers are present Cynthia WILL you see if the
servants have looked after Mr Bowerss horse You know Bob is not to be
trusted

There was clearly nothing else for Mr Bowers to do but to take his
leave which he did respectfully if not altogether hopefully But when
he had reached the lane his horse shied from the unwonted spectacle of
Bob swinging his hat and apparently awaiting him from the fork of a
wayside sapling

Hol up mister Look here

Mr Bowers pulled up Bob dropped into the road and after a backward
glance over his shoulder said

Drive longside the fence in the shadder As Mr Bowers obeyed
Bob approached the wheels of the buggy in a manner half shy half
mysterious You wanter buy them Summit woods mister

Well peraps sonny Why smiled Mr Bowers

Coz Ill tell ye suthin Dont you be fooled into allowin that
Cynthia wrote that potry She didntno moren Eunice nor me Mar
kinder let ye think it cos she dont want folks to think SHE did it
But mar wrote that potry herself wrote it out o them thar woodsall
by herself Thars a heap more potry thar you bet and jist as good
And shes the one that kin write ityou hear me Thats my mar every
time You buy that thar wood and get mar to run it for potry and
youll make your pile sure I aint lyin Youd better look spry
thars another feller snoopin round yereonly he barked up the wrong
tree and thought it was Cynthia jist as you did

Another feller repeated the astonished Bowers

Yes a riglar sport He was orful keen on that potry too you bet
So youd better hump yourself afore somebody else cuts in Mar got a
hundred dollars for that pome from that editor feller and his pardner
I reckon thats the riglar price eh he added with a sudden
suspicious caution

I reckon so replied Mr Bowers blankly Butlook here Bob Do you
mean to say it was your motheryour MOTHER Bob who wrote that poem
Are you sure

Dye think Im lyin said Bob scornfully Dont I know Dont I
copy em out plain for her so as folks wont know her handwrite Go
way youre loony Then possibly doubting if this latter expression
were strictly diplomatic with the business in hand he added in
halfreproach halfapology Dont ye see I dont want ye to be fooled
into losin yer chance o buying up that Summit wood Its the cold
truth Im tellin ye

Mr Bowers no longer doubted it Disappointed as he undoubtedly was at
firstand even selfdeceivedhe recognized in a flash the grim fact
that the boy had stated He recalled the apparition of the sadfaced
woman in the woodher distressed manner that to his inexperienced
mind now took upon itself the agitated trembling of disturbed mystic
inspiration A sense of sadness and remorse succeeded his first shock of
disappointment

Well are ye going to buy the woods said Bob eying him grimly Yed
better say

Mr Bowers started I shouldnt wonder Bob he said with a smile
gathering up his reins Anyhow Im comin back to see your mother this
afternoon And meantime Bob you keep the first chance for me

He drove away leaving the youthful diplomatist standing with his bare
feet in the dust For a minute or two the young gentleman amused himself
by a few light saltatory steps in the road Then a smile of scornful
superiority mingled perhaps with a sense of previous slights and
unappreciation drew back his little upper lip and brightened his
mottled cheek

Id like ter know he said darkly what this yer Godforsaken
famerly would do without ME


CHAPTER V


It is to be presumed that the editor and Mr Hamlin mutually kept to
their tacit agreement to respect the impersonality of the poetess
for during the next three months the subject was seldom alluded to
by either Yet in that period White Violet had sent two other
contributions and on each occasion Mr Hamlin had insisted upon
increasing the honorarium to the amount of his former gift In vain the
editor pointed out the danger of this form of munificence Mr Hamlin
retorted by saying that if he refused he would appeal to the proprietor
who certainly would not object to taking the credit of this liberality
As to the risks concluded Jack sententiously Ill take them and
as far as youre concerned you certainly get the worth of your money

Indeed if popularity was an indiction this had become suddenly true
For the poetesss third contribution without changing its strong
local color and individuality had been an unexpected outburst of human
passiona lovesong that touched those to whom the subtler meditative
graces of the poetess had been unknown Many people had listened to this
impassioned but despairing cry from some remote and charmed solitude
who had never read poetry before who translated it into their own
limited vocabulary and more limited experience and were inexpressibly
affected to find that they too understood it it was caught up and
echoed by the feverish adventurous and unsatisfied life that filled
that day and time Even the editor was surprised and frightened Like
most cultivated men he distrusted popularity like all men who believe
in their own individual judgment he doubted collective wisdom Yet
now that his protegee had been accepted by others he questioned that
judgment and became her critic It struck him that her sudden outburst
was strained it seemed to him that in this mere contortion of passion
the sibyls robe had become rudely disarranged He spoke to Hamlin and
even approached the tabooed subject

Did you see anything that suggested this sort of business ininthat
womanI mean inyour pilgrimage Jack

No responded Jack gravely But its easy to see shes got hold
of some hayfooted fellow up there in the mountains with straws in his
hair and is playing him for all hes worth You wont get much more
poetry out of her I reckon

Is was not long after this conversation that one afternoon when the
editor was alone Mr James Bowers entered the editorial room with much
of the hesitation and irresolution of his previous visit As the editor
had not only forgotten him but even dissociated him with the poetess
Mr Bowers was fain to meet his unresponsive eye and manner with some
explanation

Ye disremember my comin here Mr Editor to ask you the name o the
lady who called herself White Violet and how you allowed you couldnt
give it but would write and ask for it

Mr Editor leaning back in his chair now remembered the occurrence
but was distressed to add that the situation remained unchanged and
that he had received no such permission

Never mind THAT my lad said Mr Bowers gravely waving his hand I
understand all that but ez Ive known the lady ever since and am now
visiting her at her house on the Summit I reckon it dont make much
matter

It was quite characteristic of Mr Bowerss smileless earnestness that
he made no ostentation of this dramatic retort nor of the undisguised
stupefaction of the editor

Do you mean to say that you have met White Violet the author of these
poems repeated the editor

Which her name is Delatourthe widder Delatourez she has herself
give me permission to tell you continued Mr Bowers with a certain
abstracted and automatic precision that dissipated any suggestion of
malice in the reversed situation

Delatoura widow repeated the editor

With five children continued Mr Bowers Then with unalterable
gravity he briefly gave an outline of her condition and the
circumstances of his acquaintance with her

But I reckoned YOU might have known suthin o this though she never
let on you did he concluded eying the editor with troubled curiosity

The editor did not think it necessary to implicate Mr Hamlin He said
briefly I Oh no

Of course YOU might not have seen her said Mr Bowers keeping the
same grave troubled gaze on the editor

Of course not said the editor somewhat impatient under the singular
scrutiny of Mr Bowers and Im very anxious to know how she looks
Tell me what is she like

She is a fine powful eddicated woman said Mr Bowers with slow
deliberation Yes sira powful woman havin grand ideas of her
own and holdin to em He had withdrawn his eyes from the editor and
apparently addressed the ceiling in confidence

But what does she look like Mr Bowers said the editor smiling

Well sir she looksLIKEIT Yeswith deliberate cautionI
should say just like it

After a pause apparently to allow the editor to materialize this
ravishing description he said gently Are you busy just now

Not very What can I do for you

Well not much for ME I reckon he returned with a deeper
respiration that was his nearest approach to a sigh but suthin
perhaps for yourself andanother Are you married

No said the editor promptly

Nor engaged to anyyoung ladywith great politeness

No

Well mebbe you think it a queer thing for me to saymebbe you reckon
you KNOW it ez well ez anybodybut its my opinion that White Violet
is in love with you

With me ejaculated the editor in a hopeless astonishment that at
last gave way to an incredulous and irresistible laugh

A slight touch of pain passed over Mr Bowerss dejected face but left
the deep outlines set with a rude dignity Its SO he said slowly
though as a young man and a gay feller ye may think its funny

No not funny but a terrible blunder Mr Bowers for I give you my
word I know nothing of the lady and have never set eyes upon her

No but she has on YOU I cant say continued Mr Bowers with
sublime naivete that Id ever recognize you from her description but
a woman o that kind dont see with her eyes like you and me but with
all her senses to onct and a heap more that aint senses as we know
em The same eyes that seed down through the brush and ferns in the
Summit woods the same ears that heerd the music of the wind trailin
through the pines dont see you with my eyes or hear you with my ears
And when she paints you its natril for a woman with that powful mind
and grand idees to dip her brush into her hearts blood for warmth and
color Yer smilin young man Well go on and smile at me my lad but
not at her For you dont know her When you know her story as I do
when you know she was made a wife afore she ever knew what it was to be
a young woman when you know that the man she married never understood
the kind o critter he was tied to no more than ef hed been a steer
yoked to a Morgan colt when ye know she had children growin up around
her afore she had given over bein a sort of child herself when ye
know she worked and slaved for that man and those children about the
househer heart her soul and all her powful mind bein all the time
in the woods along with the flickering leaves and the shadderswhen
ye mind she couldnt get the small ways o the ranch because she had the
big ways o Natur that made itthen youll understand her

Impressed by the sincerity of his visitors manner touched by the
unexpected poetry of his appeal and yet keenly alive to the absurdity
of an incomprehensible blunder somewhere committed the editor gasped
almost hysterically

But why should all this make her in love with ME

Because ye are both gifted returned Mr Bowers with sad but
unconquerable conviction because yere both so to speak in a line
o idees and business that draws ye togetherto lean on each other and
trust each other ez pardners Not that YE are ezakly her ekal he went
on with a return to his previous exasperating naivete though Ive
heerd promisin things of ye and yere still young but in matters
o this kind there is allers one ez hez to be looked up to by
the otherand ginrally the wrong one She looks up to you Mr
Editorits part of her potryez she looks down inter the brush
and sees more than is plain to you and me Not he continued with a
courteously deprecating wave of the hand ez you haint bin kind to
hermebbe TOO kind For thars the purty letter you writ her thars
the perlite easy captivatin way you had with her gals and
that boyhold onas the editor made a gesture of despairing
renunciationI aint sayin you aint right in keepin it to
yourselfand thars the extry money you sent her every time Stop she
knows it was EXTRY for she made a pint o gettin me to find out the
market price o potry in papers and magazines and she reckons youve
bin payin her four hundred per cent above them figgershold on I
aint sayin it aint free and liberal in you and Id have done the
same thing yet SHE thinks

But the editor had risen hastily to his feet with flushing cheeks

One moment Mr Bowers he said hurriedly This is the most dreadful
blunder of all The gift is not mine It was the spontaneous offering
of another who really admired our friends worka gentleman whoHe
stopped suddenly

The sound of a familiar voice lightly humming was borne along the
passage the light tread of a familiar foot was approaching The editor
turned quickly towards the open doorso quickly that Mr Bowers was
fain to turn also

For a charming instant the figure of Jack Hamlin handsome careless
and confident was framed in the doorway His dark eyes with their
habitual scorn of his average fellowman swept superciliously over
Mr Bowers and rested for an instant with caressing familiarity on the
editor

Well sonny any news from the old girl at the Summit

Noo hastily stammered the editor with a halfhysterical laugh No
Jack Excuse me a moment

All right busy I see Hasta manana

The picture vanished the frame was empty

You see continued the editor turning to Mr Bowers there has been
a mistake Ibut he stopped suddenly at the ashen face of Mr Bowers
still fixed in the direction of the vanished figure

Are you ill

Mr Bowers did not reply but slowly withdrew his eyes and turned them
heavily on the editor Then drawing a longer deeper breath he picked
up his soft felt hat and moulding it into shape in his hands as if
preparing to put it on he moistened his dry grayish lips and said
gently

Friend o yours

Yes said the editorJack Hamlin Of course you know him

Yes

Mr Bowers here put his hat on his head and after a pause turned
round slowly once or twice as if he had forgotten it and was still
seeking it Finally he succeeded in finding the editors hand and shook
it albeit his own trembled slightly Then he said

I reckon youre right Theres bin a mistake I see it now Goodby
If youre ever up my way drop in and see me He then walked to the
doorway passed out and seemed to melt into the afternoon shadows of
the hall

He never again entered the office of the Excelsior Magazine neither
was any further contribution ever received from White Violet To a
polite entreaty from the editor addressed first to White Violet
and then to Mrs Delatour there was no response The thought of Mr
Hamlins cynical prophecy disturbed him but that gentleman preoccupied
in filling some professional engagements in Sacramento gave him no
chance to acquire further explanations as to the past or the future The
youthful editor was at first in despair and filled with a vague remorse
of some unfulfilled duty But to his surprise the readers of the
magazine seemed to survive their talented contributor and the feverish
life that had been thrilled by her song in two months had apparently
forgotten her Nor was her voice lifted from any alien quarter the
domestic and foreign press that had echoed her lays seemed to respond no
longer to her utterance

It is possible that some readers of these pages may remember a previous
chronicle by the same historian wherein it was recorded that the
volatile spirit of Mr Hamlin slightly assisted by circumstances
passed beyond these voices at the Ranch of the Blessed Fisherman some
two years later As the editor stood beside the body of his friend on
the morning of the funeral he noticed among the flowers laid upon his
bier by loving hands a wreath of white violets Touched and disturbed
by a memory long since forgotten he was further embarrassed as the
cortege dispersed in the Mission graveyard by the apparition of the
tall figure of Mr James Bowers from behind a monumental column The
editor turned to him quickly

I am glad to see you here he said awkwardly and he knew not
why then after a pause I trust you can give me some news of Mrs
Delatour I wrote to her nearly two years ago but had no response

Thars bin no Mrs Delatour for two years said Mr Bowers
contemplatively stroking his beard and mebbe thats why Shes bin for
two years Mrs Bowers

I congratulate you said the editor but I hope there still remains
a White Violet and that for the sake of literature she has not given
up

Mrs Bowers interrupted Mr Bowers with singular deliberation
found that makin potry and tendin to the cares of a growinup
famerly was irritatin to the narves They didnt jibe so to speak
What Mrs Bowers wantedand what potry or no potry Ive bin tryin
to give herwas Rest Shes bin havin it comforbly up at my ranch

THE CHATELAINE OF BURNT RIDGE


CHAPTER I


It had grown dark on Burnt Ridge Seen from below the whole serrated
crest that had glittered in the sunset as if its interstices were eaten
by consuming fires now closed up its ranks of blackened shafts and
became again harsh and sombre chevaux de frise against the sky A faint
glow still lingered over the red valley road as if it were its own
reflection rather than any light from beyond the darkened ridge Night
was already creeping up out of remote canyons and along the furrowed
flanks of the mountain or settling on the nearer woods with the sound
of homecoming and innumerable wings At a point where the road began to
encroach upon the mountainside in its slow winding ascent the darkness
had become so real that a young girl cantering along the rising terrace
found difficulty in guiding her horse with eyes still dazzled by the
sunset fires

In spite of her precautions the animal suddenly shied at some object
in the obscured roadway and nearly unseated her The accident disclosed
not only the fact that she was riding in a mans saddle but also a foot
and ankle that her ordinary walkingdress was too short to hide It was
evident that her equestrian exercise was extempore and that at that
hour and on that road she had not expected to meet company But she was
apparently a good horsewoman for the mischance which might have thrown
a less practical or more timid rider seemed of little moment to her
With a strong hand and determined gesture she wheeled her frightened
horse back into the track and rode him directly at the object But here
she herself slightly recoiled for it was the body of a man lying in the
road

As she leaned forward over her horses shoulder she could see by the
dim light that he was a miner and that though motionless he was
breathing stertorously Drunk no doubtan accident of the locality
alarming only to her horse But although she cantered impatiently
forward she had not proceeded a hundred yards before she stopped
reflectively and trotted back again He had not moved She could now
see that his head and shoulders were covered with broken clods of earth
and gravel and smaller fragments lay at his side A dozen feet above
him on the hillside there was a foot trail which ran parallel with the
bridleroad and occasionally overhung it It seemed possible that he
might have fallen from the trail and been stunned

Dismounting she succeeded in dragging him to a safer position by the
bank The act discovered his face which was young and unknown to her
Wiping it with the silk handkerchief which was loosely slung around his
neck after the fashion of his class she gave a quick feminine glance
around her and then approached her own and rather handsome face near his
lips There was no odor of alcohol in the thick and heavy respiration
Mounting again she rode forward at an accelerated pace and in twenty
minutes had reached a higher tableland of the mountain a cleared
opening in the forest that showed signs of careful cultivation and
a large rambling yet picturesquelooking dwelling whose unpainted
redwood walls were hidden in roses and creepers Pushing open a
swinging gate she entered the inclosure as a brownfaced man dressed
as a vaquero came towards her as if to assist her to alight But she
had already leaped to the ground and thrown him the reins

Miguel she said with a mistresss quiet authority in her boyish
contralto voice put Glory in the covered wagon and drive down the
road as far as the valley turning Theres a man lying near the right
bank drunk or sick may be or perhaps crippled by a fall Bring him
up here unless somebody has found him already or you happen to know
who he is and where to take him

The vaquero raised his shoulders half in disappointed expectation
of some other command And your brother senora he has not himself
arrived

A light shadow of impatience crossed her face No she said bluntly
Come be quick

She turned towards the house as the man moved away Already a
gauntlooking old man had appeared in the porch and was awaiting her
with his hand shadowing his angry suspicious eyes and his lips moving
querulously

Of course youve got to stand out there and give orders and tend
to your own business afore you think o speaking to your own flesh and
blood he said aggrievedly Thats all YOU care

There was a sick man lying in the road and Ive sent Miguel to look
after him returned the girl with a certain contemptuous resignation

Oh yes struck in another voice which seemed to belong to the female
of the first speakers species and to be its equal in age and temper
and I reckon you saw a jay bird on a tree or a squirrel on the fence
and either of em was more important to you than your own brother

Steve didnt come by the stage and didnt send any message continued
the young girl with the same coldly resigned manner No one had any
news of him and as I told you before I didnt expect any

Why dont you say right out you didnt WANT any said the old man
sneeringly Much you inquired No I orter hev gone myself and I would
if I was master here instead of me and your mother bein the dust of
the yearth beneath your feet

The young girl entered the house followed by the old man passing an
old woman seated by the window who seemed to be nursing her resentment
and a large Bible which she held clasped against her shawled bosom
at the same moment Going to the wall she hung up her large hat
and slightly shook the red dust from her skirts as she continued her
explanation in the same deep voice with a certain monotony of logic
and possibly of purpose and practice also

You and mother know as well as I do father that Stephen is no more to
be depended upon than the wind that blows Its three years since he has
been promising to come and even getting money to come and yet he has
never showed his face though he has been a dozen times within five
miles of this house He doesnt come because he doesnt want to come As
to YOUR going over to the stageoffice I went there myself at the last
moment to save you the mortification of asking questions of strangers
that they know have been a dozen times answered already

There was such a ring of absolute truthfulness albeit worn by
repetition in the young girls deep honest voice that for one instant
her two more emotional relatives quailed before it but only for a
moment

Thats right shrilled the old woman Go on and abuse your own
brother Its only the fear you have that hell make his fortune yet and
shame you before the father and mother you despise

The young girl remained standing by the window motionless and
apparently passive as if receiving an accepted and usual punishment
But here the elder woman gave way to sobs and some incoherent snuffling
at which the younger went away Whether she recognized in her mothers
tears the ordinary deliquescence of emotion or whether as a woman
herself she knew that this mere feminine conventionality could not
possibly be directed at her and that the actual conflict between them
had ceased she passed slowly on to an inner hall leaving the male
victim her unfortunate father to succumb as he always did sooner or
later to their influence Crossing the hall which was decorated with a
few elk horns Indian trophies and mountain pelts she entered another
room and closed the door behind her with a gesture of relief

The room which looked upon a porch presented a singular combination of
masculine business occupations and feminine taste and adornment A desk
covered with papers a shelf displaying a ledger and accountbooks
another containing works of reference a table with a vase of flowers
and a ladys ridingwhip upon it a map of California flanked on either
side by an embroidered silken workbag and an oval mirror decked with
grasses a calendar and interesttable hanging below two schoolgirl
crayons of classic heads with the legend Josephine Forsyth
fecitwere part of its incongruous accessories The young girl
went to her desk but presently moved and turned towards the window
thoughtfully The last gleam had died from the steelblue sky a
few lights like star points began to prick out the lower valley The
expression of monotonous restraint and endurance had not yet faded from
her face

Yet she had been accustomed to scenes like the one she had just passed
though since her girlhood Five years ago Alexander Forsyth her uncle
had brought her to this spotthen a mere log cabin on the hillsideas
a refuge from the impoverished and shiftless home of his elder brother
Thomas and his illtempered wife Here Alexander Forsyth by reason of
his more dominant character and business capacity had prospered until
he became a rich and influential ranch owner Notwithstanding her
fathers jealousy of Alexanders fortune and the open rupture that
followed between the brothers Josephine retained her position in the
heart and home of her uncle without espousing the cause of either and
her father was too prudent not to recognize the near and prospective
advantages of such a mediator Accustomed to her parents extravagant
denunciations and her uncles more repressed but practical contempt of
them the unfortunate girl early developed a cynical disbelief in the
virtues of kinship in the abstract and a philosophical resignation to
its effects upon her personally Believing that her father and uncle
fairly represented the fraternal principle she was quite prepared for
the early defection and distrust of her vagabond and dissipated brother
Stephen and accepted it calmly True to an odd standard of justice
which she had erected from the crumbling ruins of her own domestic
life she was tolerant of everything but human perfection This quality
however fatal to her higher growth had given her a peculiar capacity
for business which endeared her to her uncle Familiar with the
strong passions and prejudices of men she had none of those feminine
meannesses a wholesome distrust of which had kept her uncle a bachelor
It was not strange therefore that when he died two years ago it was
found that he had left her his entire property real and personal
limited only by a single condition She was to undertake the vocation
of a sole trader and carry on the business under the name of J
Forsyth If she married the estate and property was to be held
distinct from her husbands inalienable under the Married Womans
Property Act and subject during her life only to her own control and
personal responsibilities as a trader

The intense disgust and discomfiture of her parents who had expected to
more actively participate in their brothers fortune may be imagined
But it was not equal to their fury when Josephine instead of providing
for them a separate maintenance out of her abundance simply offered to
transfer them and her brother to her own house on a domestic but not
a business equality There being no alternative but their former
precarious shiftless life in their playedout claim in the valley
they wisely consented reserving the sacred right of daily protest and
objurgation In the economy of Burnt Ridge Ranch they alone took it upon
themselves to represent the shattered domestic altar and its outraged
Lares and Penates And so conscientiously did they perform their task
as even occasionally to impede the business visitor to the ranch and to
cause some of the more practical neighbors seriously to doubt the young
girls commercial wisdom But she was firm Whether she thought her
parents a necessity of respectable domesticity or whether she regarded
their presence in the light of a penitential atonement for some previous
disregard of them no one knew Public opinion inclined to the latter

The black line of ridge faded out with her abstraction and she
turned from the window and lit the lamp on her desk The yellow light
illuminated her face and figure In their womanly graces there was no
trace of what some people believed to be a masculine character except
a singularly frank look of critical inquiry and patient attention in her
dark eyes Her long brown hair was somewhat rigidly twisted into a knot
on the top of her head as if more for security than ornament Brown
was also the prevailing tint of her eyebrows thicklyset eyelashes and
eyes and was even suggested in the slight sallowness of her complexion
But her lips were wellcut and freshcolored and her hands and feet
small and finely formed She would have passed for a pretty girl had
she not suggested something more

She sat down and began to examine a pile of papers before her with that
concentration and attention to detail which was characteristic of her
eyes pausing at times with prettily knit brows and her penholder
between her lips in the semblance of a pout that was pleasant enough to
see Suddenly the rattle of hoofs and wheels struck her with the sense
of something forgotten and she put down her work quickly and stood up
listening The sound of rough voices and her fathers querulous accents
was broken upon by a cultivated and more familiar utterance All right
Ill speak to her at once Wait there and the door opened to the
wellknown physician of Burnt Ridge Dr Duchesne

Look here he said with an abruptness that was only saved from being
brusque by a softer intonation and a reassuring smile I met Miguel
helping an accident into your buggy Your orders eh

Oh yes said Josephine quietly A man I saw on the road

Well its a bad case and wants prompt attention And as your house is
the nearest I came with him here

Certainly she said gravely Take him to the second room
beyondSteves roomits ready she explained to two dusky shadows in
the hall behind the doctor

And look here said the doctor partly closing the door behind him
and regarding her with critical eyes you always said youd like to see
some of my queer cases Well this is onea serious one too in fact
its just touch and go with him Theres a piece of the bone pressing
on the brain no bigger than that but as much as if all Burnt Ridge was
atop of him Im going to lift it I want somebody here to stand by
some one who can lend a hand with a sponge ehsome one who isnt
going to faint or scream or even shake a hairsbreadth eh

The color rose quickly to the girls cheek and her eyes kindled Ill
come she said thoughtfully Who is he

The doctor stared slightly at the unessential query Dont knowone
of the river miners I reckon Its an urgent case Ill go and get
everything ready Youd better he added with an ominous glance at
her gray frock put something over your dress The suggestion made her
grave but did not alter her color

A moment later she entered the room It was the one that had always been
set apart for her brother the very bed on which the unconscious man
lay had been arranged that morning with her own hands Something of
this passed through her mind as she saw that the doctor had wheeled it
beneath the strong light in the centre of the room stripped its
outer coverings with professional thoughtfulness and rearranged the
mattresses But it did not seem like the same room There was a pungent
odor in the air from some freshlyopened phial an almost feminine
neatness and luxury in an open morocco case like a jewel box on the
table shining with spotless steel At the head of the bed one of her
own servants the powerful mill foreman was assisting with the
mingled curiosity and blase experience of one accustomed to smashed and
lacerated digits At first she did not look at the central unconscious
figure on the bed whose sufferings seemed to her to have been
vicariously transferred to the concerned eager and drawn faces that
looked down upon its immunity Then she femininely recoiled before the
bared white neck and shoulders displayed above the quilt until forcing
herself to look upon the face halfconcealed by bandages and the head
from which the dark tangles of hair had been ruthlessly sheared she
began to share the doctors unconcern in his personality What mattered
who or what HE was It wasa case

The operation began With the same earnest intelligence that she had
previously shown she quickly and noiselessly obeyed the doctors
whispered orders and even half anticipated them She was conscious of a
singular curiosity that far from being mean or ignoble seemed to lift
her not only above the ordinary weaknesses of her own sex but made her
superior to the men around her Almost before she knew it the operation
was over and she regarded with equal curiosity the ostentatious
solicitude with which the doctor seemed to be wiping his fateful
instrument that bore an odd resemblance to a silverhandled centrebit
The stertorous breathing below the bandages had given way to a fainter
but more natural respiration There was a moment of suspense The
doctors hand left the pulse and lifted the closed eyelid of the
sufferer A slight movement passed over the figure The sluggish face
had cleared life seemed to struggle back into it before even the dull
eyes participated in the glow Dr Duchesne with a sudden gesture waved
aside his companions but not before Josephine had bent her head eagerly
forward

He is coming to she said

At the sound of that deep clear voicethe first to break the hush of
the roomthe dull eyes leaped up and the head turned in its direction
The lips moved and uttered a single rapid sentence The girl recoiled

Youre all right now said the doctor cheerfully intent only upon
the form before him

The lips moved again but this time feebly and vacantly the eyes were
staring vaguely around

Whats matter Whats all about said the man thickly

Youve had a fall Think a moment Where do you live

Again the lips moved but this time only to emit a confused incoherent
murmur Dr Duchesne looked grave but recovered himself quickly

That will do Leave him alone now he said brusquely to the others

But Josephine lingered

He spoke well enough just now she said eagerly Did you hear what he
said

Not exactly said the doctor abstractedly gazing at the man

He said Youll have to kill me first said Josephine slowly

Humph said the doctor passing his hand backwards and forwards before
the mans eyes to note any change in the staring pupils

Yes continued Josephine gravely I suppose she added cautiously
he was thinking of the operationof what you had just done to him

What I had done to him Oh yes


CHAPTER II


Before noon the next day it was known throughout Burnt Ridge Valley that
Dr Duchesne had performed a difficult operation upon an unknown man
who had been picked up unconscious from a fall and carried to Burnt
Ridge Ranch But although the unfortunate mans life was saved by the
operation he had only momentarily recovered consciousnessrelapsing
into a semiidiotic state which effectively stopped the discovery
of any clue to his friends or his identity As it was evidently an
ACCIDENT which in that rude communityand even in some more civilized
onesconveyed a vague impression of some contributary incapacity on the
part of the victim or some Providential interference of a retributive
character Burnt Ridge gave itself little trouble about it It is
unnecessary to say that Mr and Mrs Forsyth gave themselves and
Josephine much more They had a theory and a grievance Satisfied from
the first that the alleged victim was a drunken tramp who submitted to
have a hole bored in his head in order to foist himself upon the ranch
they were loud in their protests even hinting at a conspiracy between
Josephine and the stranger to supplant her brother in the property as
he had already in the spare bedroom Didnt all that yer happen THE
VERY NIGHT she pretended to go for Stepheneh said Mrs Forsyth
Tell me that And didnt she have it all arranged with the buggy
to bring him here as that sneaking doctor let outeh Looks mighty
curious dont it she muttered darkly to the old man But although
that gentleman even from his own selfish view would scarcely have
submitted to a surgical operation and later idiocy as the price of
insuring comfortable dependency he had no doubt others were base enough
to do it and lent a willing ear to his wifes suspicions

Josephines personal knowledge of the stranger went little further
Doctor Duchesne had confessed to her his professional disappointment at
the incomplete results of the operation He had saved the mans life
but as yet not his reason There was still hope however for the
diagnosis revealed nothing that might prejudice a favorable progress It
was a most interesting case He would watch it carefully and as soon
as the patient could be removed would take him to the county hospital
where under his own eyes the poor fellow would have the benefit of
the latest science and the highest specialists Physically he was doing
remarkably well indeed he must have been a fine young chap free from
blood taint or vicious complication whose flesh had healed like an
infants It should be recorded that it was at this juncture that Mrs
Forsyth first learnt that a SILVER PLATE let into the artful strangers
skull was an adjunct of the healing process Convinced that this
infamous extravagance was part and parcel of the conspiracy and was
only the beginning of other assimilations of the Forsyths metallic
substance that the plate was probably polished and burnished with
a fulsome inscription to the doctors skill and would pass into the
possession and adornment of a perfect stranger her rage knew no bounds
He or his friends ought to be made to pay for it or work it out In vain
it was declared that a few dollars were all that was found in the mans
pocket and that no memoranda gave any indication of his name friends
or history beyond the suggestion that he came from a distance This was
clearly a part of the conspiracy Even Josephines practical good
sense was obliged to take note of this singular absence of all record
regarding him and the apparent obliteration of everything that might be
responsible for his ultimate fate

Homeless friendless helpless and even nameless the unfortunate man
of twentyfive was thus left to the tender mercies of the mistress of
Burnt Ridge Ranch as if he had been a newborn foundling laid at her
door But this mere claim of weakness was not all it was supplemented
by a singular personal appeal to Josephines nature From the time that
he turned his head towards her voice on that fateful night his eyes had
always followed her around the room with a wondering yearning canine
halfintelligence Without being able to convince herself that he
understood her better than his regular attendant furnished by the
doctor she could not fail to see that he obeyed her implicitly and
that whenever any difficulty arose between him and his nurse she was
always appealed to Her pride in this proof of her practical sovereignty
WAS flattered and when Doctor Duchesne finally admitted that although
the patient was now physically able to be removed to the hospital yet
he would lose in the change that very strong factor which Josephine had
become in his mental recovery the young girl as frankly suggested that
he should stay as long as there was any hope of restoring his reason
Doctor Duchesne was delighted With all his enthusiasm for science he
had a professional distrust of some of its disciples and perhaps was
not sorry to keep this most interesting case in his own hands To
him her suggestion was only a womanly kindness tempered with womanly
curiosity But the astonishment and stupefaction of her parents at this
evident corroboration of suspicions they had as yet only half believed
was tinged with superstitious dread Had she fallen in love with this
helpless stranger or more awful to contemplate was he really no
stranger but a surreptitious lover thus strategically brought under her
roof For once they refrained from open criticism The very magnitude of
their suspicions left them dumb

It was thus that the virgin Chatelaine of Burnt Ridge Ranch was left to
gaze untrammeled upon her pale and handsome guest whose silken
bearded lips and sad childlike eyes might have suggested a more Exalted
Sufferer in their absence of any suggestion of a grosser material
manhood But even this imaginative appeal did not enter into her
feelings She felt for her goodlooking helpless patient a profound
and honest pity I do not know whether she had ever heard that pity was
akin to love She would probably have resented that utterly untenable
and atrocious commonplace There was no suggestion real or illusive
of any previous masterful quality in the man which might have made his
present dependent condition picturesque by contrast He had come to her
handicapped by an unromantic accident and a practical want of energy and
intellect He would have to touch her interest anew if indeed he
would ever succeed in dispelling the old impression His beauty in a
community of picturesquely handsome men had little weight with her
except to accent the contrast with their fuller manhood

Her life had given her no illusions in regard to the other sex She had
found them however more congenial and safer companions than women and
more accessible to her own sense of justice and honor In return they
had respected and admired rather than loved her in spite of her womanly
graces If she had at times contemplated eventual marriage it was only
as a possible practical partnership in her business but as she lived in
a country where men thought it dishonorable and a proof of incompetency
to rise by their wives superior fortune she had been free from that
kind of mercenary persecution even from men who might have worshiped
her in hopeless and silent honor

For this reason there was nothing in the situation that suggested
a single compromising speculation in the minds of the neighbors or
disturbed her own tranquillity There seemed to be nothing in the future
except a possible relief to her curiosity Some day the unfortunate
mans reason would be restored and he would tell his simple history
Perhaps he might explain what was in his mind when he turned to her
the first evening with that singular sentence which had often recurred
strangely to her she knew not why It did not strike her until later
that it was because it had been the solitary indication of an energy and
capacity that seemed unlike him Nevertheless after that explanation
she would have been quite willing to have shaken hands with him and
parted

And yetfor there was an unexpressed remainder in her thoughtshe
was never entirely free or uninfluenced in his presence The flickering
vacancy of his sad eyes sometimes became fixed with a resolute
immobility under the gentle questioning with which she had sought to
draw out his faculties that both piqued and exasperated her He could
say Yes and No as she thought intelligently but he could not utter
a coherent sentence nor write a word except like a child in imitation
of his copy She taught him to repeat after her the names of the
inanimate objects in the room then the names of the doctor his
attendant the servant and finally her own under her Christian
prenomen with frontier familiarity but when she pointed to himself he
waited for HER to name him In vain she tried him with all the masculine
names she knew his was not one of them or he would not or could not
speak it For at times she rejected the professional dictum of the
doctor that the faculty of memory was wholly paralyzed or held in
abeyance even to the halfautomatic recollection of his letters yet
she inconsistently began to teach him the alphabet with the same method
andin her sublime unconsciousness of his manhoodwith the
same discipline as if he were a very child When he had recovered
sufficiently to leave his room she would lead him to the porch before
her window and make him contented and happy by allowing him to watch
her at work at her desk occasionally answering his wondering eyes with
a word or stirring his faculties with a question I grieve to say
that her parents had taken advantage of this publicity and his supposed
helpless condition to show their disgust of his assumption to the
extreme of making faces at himan act which he resented with such a
furious glare that they retreated hurriedly to their own veranda A
fresh though somewhat inconsistent grievance was added to their previous
indictment of him If we aint found dead in our bed with our throats
cut by that womans crazy husband they had settled by this time that
there had been a clandestine marriage well be lucky groaned Mrs
Forsyth

Meantime the mountain summer waxed to its fullness of fire and
fruition There were days when the crowded forest seemed choked and
impeded with its own foliage and pungent and stifling with its own
rank maturity when the long hillside ranks of wild oats thickset and
impassable filled the air with the heated dust of germination In this
quickening irritation of life it would be strange if the unfortunate
mans torpid intellect was not helped in its awakening and he was
allowed to ramble at will over the ranch but with the instinct of a
domestic animal he always returned to the house and sat in the porch
where Josephine usually found him awaiting her when she herself returned
from a visit to the mill Coming thence one day she espied him on the
mountainside leaning against a projecting ledge in an attitude so rapt
and immovable that she felt compelled to approach him He appeared to
be dumbly absorbed in the prospect which might have intoxicated a saner
mind

Half veiled by the heat that rose quiveringly from the fiery canyon
below the domain of Burnt Ridge stretched away before him until
lifted in successive terraces hearsed and plumed with pines it was at
last lost in the ghostly snowpeaks But the practical Josephine seized
the opportunity to try once more to awaken the slumbering memory of her
pupil Following his gaze with signs and questions she sought to draw
from him some indication of familiar recollection of certain points of
the map thus unrolled behind him But in vain She even pointed out the
fateful shadow of the overhanging ledge on the road where she had picked
him upthere was no response in his abstracted eyes She bit her lips
she was becoming irritated again Then it occurred to her that instead
of appealing to his hopeless memory she had better trust to some
unreflective automatic instinct independent of it and she put the
question a little forward When you leave us where will you go from
here He stirred slightly and turned towards her She repeated her
query slowly and patiently with signs and gestures recognized between
them A faint glow of intelligence struggled into his eyes he lifted
his arm slowly and pointed

Ah those white peaksthe Sierras she asked eagerly No reply
Beyond them

Yes

The States No reply Further still

He remained so patiently quiet and still pointing that she leaned
forward and following with her eyes the direction of his hand saw
that he was pointing to the sky

Then a great quiet fell upon them The whole mountainside seemed to her
to be hushed as if to allow her to grasp and realize for the first time
the pathos of the ruined life at her side which IT had known so long
but which she had never felt till now The tears came to her eyes in
her swift revulsion of feeling she caught the thin uplifted hand between
her own It seemed to her that he was about to raise them to his lips
but she withdrew them hastily and moved away She had a strange fear
that if he had kissed them it might seem as if some dumb animal had
touched themorIT MIGHT NOT The next day she felt a consciousness
of this in his presence and a wish that he was wellcured and away She
determined to consult Dr Duchesne on the subject when he next called

But the doctor secure in the welfare of his patient had not visited
him lately and she found herself presently absorbed in the business of
the ranch which at this season was particularly trying There had also
been a quarrel between Dick Shipley her mill foreman and Miguel her
ablest and most trusted vaquero and in her strict sense of impartial
justice she was obliged to side on the merits of the case with Shipley
against her oldest retainer This troubled her as she knew that with
the Mexican nature fidelity and loyalty were not unmixed with quick and
unreasoning jealousy For this reason she was somewhat watchful of the
two men when work was over and there was a chance of their being
thrown together Once or twice she had remained up late to meet Miguel
returning from the posada at San Ramon filled with aguardiente and a
recollection of his wrongs and to see him safely bestowed before she
herself retired It was on one of those occasions however that she
learned that Dick Shipley hearing that Miguel had disparaged him freely
at the posada had broken the discipline of the ranch and absented
himself the same night that Miguel had leave with a view of facing
his antagonist on his own ground To prevent this the fearless girl at
once secretly set out alone to overtake and bring back the delinquent

For two or three hours the house was thus left to the sole occupancy of
Mr and Mrs Forsyth and the invalida fact only dimly suspected by the
latter who had become vaguely conscious of Josephines anxiety and had
noticed the absence of light and movement in her room For this reason
therefore having risen again and mechanically taken his seat in the
porch to await her return he was startled by hearing HER voice in the
shadow of the lower porch accompanied by a hurried tapping against the
door of the old couple The halfreasoning man arose and would have
moved towards it but suddenly he stopped rigidly with white and parted
lips and vacantly distended eyeballs

Meantime the voice and muffled tapping had brought the tremulous fingers
of old Forsyth to the doorlatch He opened the door partly a slight
figure that had been lurking in the shadow of the porch pushed rapidly
through the opening There was a faint outcry quickly hushed and the
door closed again The rays of a single candle showed the two old people
hysterically clasping in their arms the figure that had entereda
slight but viciouslooking young fellow of fiveandtwenty

There dn it he said impatiently in a voice whose rich depth was
like Josephines but whose querulous action was that of the two old
people before him let me go and quit that I didnt come here to be
strangled I want some moneymoney you hear Devilish quick too for
Ive got to be off again before daylight So look sharp will you

But Stevy dear when you didnt come that time three months ago but
wrote from Los Angeles you said youd made a strike at last and

What are you talking about he interrupted violently That was just
my lyin to keep you from worryin me Three months agothree months
ago Why you must have been crazy to have swallowed it I hadnt a
cent

Nor have we said the old woman shrilly That hellish sister of
yours still keeps us like beggars Our only hope was you our own boy
And now you only come toto go again

But SHE has money SHES doing well and SHE shall give it to me
he went on angrily She cant bully me with her business airs and
morality Who else has got a right to share if it is not her own
brother

Alas for the fatuousness of human malevolence Had the unhappy couple
related only the simple facts they knew about the new guest of Burnt
Ridge Ranch and the manner of his introduction they might have spared
what followed

But the old woman broke into a vindictive cry Who else Stevewho
else Why the slut has brought a MAN herea sneaking deceitful
underhanded crazy lover

Oh has she said the young man fiercely yet secretly pleased at
this promising evidence of his sisters human weakness Where is she
Ill go to her Shes in her room I suppose and before they could
restrain him he had thrown off their impeding embraces and darted
across the hall

The two old people stared doubtfully at each other For even this
powerful ally whose strength however they were by no means sure
of might succumb before the determined Josephine Prudence demanded a
middle course Aint they brother and sister said the old man with
an air of virtuous toleration Let em fight it out

The young man impatiently entered the room he remembered to have been
his sisters By the light of the moon that streamed upon the window
he could see she was not there He passed hurriedly to the door of her
bedroom it was open the room was empty the bed unturned She was not
in the houseshe had gone to the mill Ah What was that they had said
An infamous thought passed through the scoundrels mind Then in what
he half believed was an access of virtuous fury he began by the dim
light to rummage in the drawers of the desk for such loose coin or
valuables as in the perfect security of the ranch were often left
unguarded Suddenly he heard a heavy footstep on the threshold and
turned

An awful visiona recollection so unexpected so ghostlike in that
weird light that he thought he was losing his sensesstood before him
It moved forwards with staring eyeballs and white and open lips from
which a horrible inarticulate sound issued that was the speech of no
living man With a single desperate almost superhuman effort Stephen
Forsyth bounded aside leaped from the window and ran like a madman
from the house Then the apparition trembled collapsed and sank in an
undistinguishable heap to the ground

When Josephine Forsyth returned an hour later with her mill foreman she
was startled to find her helpless patient in a fit on the floor of her
room With the assistance of her now converted and penitent employee
she had the unfortunate man conveyed to his roombut not until she had
thoughtfully rearranged the disorder of her desk and closed the open
drawers without attracting Dick Shipleys attention In the morning
hearing that the patient was still in the semiconscious exhaustion of
his late attack but without seeing him she sent for Dr Duchesne The
doctor arrived while she was absent at the mill where after a careful
examination of his patient he sought her with some little excitement

Well she said with eager gravity

Well it looks as if your wish would be gratified Your friend has
had an epileptic fit but the physical shock has started his mental
machinery again He has recovered his faculties his memory is
returning he thinks and speaks coherently he is as sane as you and I

Andsaid Josephine questioning the doctors knitted eyebrows

I am not yet sure whether it was the result of some shock he doesnt
remember or an irritation of the brain which would indicate that the
operation had not been successful and that there was still some physical
pressure or obstruction therein which case he would be subject to
these attacks all his life

Do you think his reason came before the fit or after asked the girl
anxiously

I couldnt say Had anything happened

I was away and found him on the floor on my return she answered
half uneasily After a pause she said Then he has told you his name
and all about himself

Yes its nothing at all He was a stranger just arrived from the
States going to the minesthe old story had no near relations of
course wasnt missed or asked after remembers walking along the ridge
and falling over name John Baxter of Maine He paused and relaxing
into a slight smile added I havent spoiled your romance have I

No she said with an answering smile Then as the doctor walked
briskly away she slightly knitted her pretty brows hung her head
patted the ground with her little foot beyond the hem of her gown and
said to herself The man was lying to him


CHAPTER III


On her return to the house Josephine apparently contented herself with
receiving the bulletin of the strangers condition from the servant for
she did not enter his room She had obtained no theory of last nights
incident from her parents who beyond a querulous agitation that was
quickened by the news of his return to reason refrained from even that
insidious comment which she half feared would follow When another
day passed without her seeing him she nevertheless was conscious of a
little embarrassment when his attendant brought her the request that
she would give him a moments speech in the porch whither he had been
removed

She found him physically weaker indeed so much so that she was fain
even in her embarrassment to assist him back to the bench from which
he had ceremoniously risen But she was so struck with the change in
his face and manner a change so virile and masterful in spite of its
gentle sadness of manner that she recoiled with a slight timidity as if
he had been a stranger although she was also conscious that he seemed
to be more at his ease than she was He began in a low exhausted voice
but before he had finished his first sentence she felt herself in the
presence of a superior

My thanks come very late Miss Forsyth he said with a faint smile
but no one knows better than yourself the reason why or can better
understand that they mean that the burden you have so generously taken
on yourself is about to be lifted I know all Miss Forsyth Since
yesterday I have learned how much I owe you even my life I believe
though I am afraid I must tell you in the same breath that THAT is of
little worth to any one You have kindly helped and interested yourself
in a poor stranger who turns out to be a nobody without friends
without romance and without even mystery You found me lying in the
road down yonder after a stupid accident that might have happened to
any other careless tramp and which scarcely gave me a claim to a bed
in the county hospital much less under this kindly roof It was not my
fault as you know that all this did not come out sooner but while it
doesnt lessen your generosity it doesnt lessen my debt and although
I cannot hope to ever repay you I can at least keep the score from
running on Pardon my speaking so bluntly but my excuse for speaking at
all was to say Goodby and God bless you Dr Duchesne has promised
to give me a lift on my way in his buggy when he goes

There was a slight touch of consciousness in his voice in spite of its
sadness which struck the young girl as a weak and even ungentlemanly
note in his otherwise selfabnegating and undemonstrative attitude If
he was a common tramp he wouldnt talk in that way and if he wasnt
why did he lie Her practical good sense here asserted itself

But you are far from strong yet in fact the doctor says you might
have a relapse at any moment and you havethat is you SEEM to have no
money she said gravely

Thats true he said quickly I remember I was quite played out when
I entered the settlement and I think I had parted from even some little
trifles I carried with me I am afraid I was a poor find to those who
picked me up and you ought to have taken warning But the doctor has
offered to lend me enough to take me to San Francisco if only to give a
fair trial to the machine he has set once more agoing

Then you have friends in San Francisco said the young girl quickly
Those who know you Why not write to them first and tell them you are
here

I dont think your postmaster here would be preoccupied with letters
for John Baxter if I did he said quietly But here is the doctor
waiting Goodby

He stood looking at her in a peculiar yet halfresigned way and held
out his hand For a moment she hesitated Had he been less independent
and strong she would have refused to let him gohave offered him
some slight employment at the ranch for oddly enough in spite of the
suspicion that he was concealing something she felt that she would have
trusted him and he would have been a help to her But he was not only
determined but SHE was all the time conscious that he was a totally
different man from the one she had taken care of and merely ordinary
prudence demanded that she should know something more of him first She
gave him her hand constrainedly he pressed it warmly

Dr Duchesne drove up helped him into the buggy smiled a goodnatured
but halfperfunctory assurance that he would look after her patient
and drove away

The whole thing was over but so unexpectedly so suddenly so
unromantically so unsatisfactorily that although her common sense
told her that it was perfectly natural proper businesslike and
reasonable and above all final and complete she did not know whether
to laugh or be angry Yet this was her parting from the man who had but
a few days ago moved her to tears with a single hopeless gesture
Well this would teach her what to expect Well what had she expected
Nothing

Yet for the rest of the day she was unreasonably irritable and if the
conjointure be not paradoxical severely practical and inhumanly
just Falling foul of some presumption of Miguels based upon his
prescriptive rights through long service on the estate with the
recollection of her severity towards his antagonist in her mind she
rated that trusted retainer with such pitiless equity and unfeminine
logic that his hot Latin blood chilled in his veins and he stood livid
on the road Then informing Dick Shipley with equally relentless calm
that she might feel it necessary to change ALL her foremen unless
they could agree in harmony she sought the dignified seclusion of
her castle But her respected parents whose triumphant relief at the
strangers departure had emboldened them to await her return in their
porch with bended bows of invective and lifted javelins of aggression
recoiled before the resistless helm of this coldbrowed Minerva who
galloped contemptuously past them

Nevertheless she sat late that night at her desk The cold moon looked
down upon her window and lit up the empty porch where her silent guest
had mutely watched her For a moment she regretted that he had recovered
his reason excusing herself on the practical ground that he would never
have known his dependence and he would have been better cared for
by her She felt restless and uneasy This slight divergence from the
practical groove in which her life had been set had disturbed her in
many other things and given her the first views of the narrowness of
it

Suddenly she heard a step in the porch The lateness of the hour
perhaps some other reason seemed to startle her and she half rose
The next moment the figure of Miguel appeared at the doorway and with
a quick hurried look around him and at the open window he approached
her He was evidently under great excitement his hollow shaven
cheek looked like a waxen effigy in the mission church his yellow
tobaccostained eye glittered like phosphorescent amber his lank
gray hair was damp and perspiring but more striking than this was the
evident restraint he had put upon himself pressing his broadbrimmed
sombrero with both of his trembling yellow hands against his breast The
young girl cast a hurried glance at the open window and at the gun which
stood in the corner and then confronted him with clear and steady eyes
but a paler cheek

Ah he began in Spanish which he himself had taught her as a child
it was a strange thing his coming there tonight but then mother of
God it was a strange a terrible thing that she had done to himold
Miguel her uncles servant he that had known her as a muchacha he
that had lived all his life at the ranchay and whose fathers before
him had lived there all THEIR lives and driven the cattle over the very
spot where she now stood before the thieving Americans came here But
he would be calm yes the senora should find him calm even as she
was when she told him to go He would not speak No heMiguelwould
contain himself yes he HAD mastered himself but could he restrain
others Ah yes OTHERSthat was it Could he keep Manuel and Pepe and
Dominguez from talking to the milkmanthat leaking sieve that gabbling
brute of a Shipley for whose sake she had cast off her old servant that
very day

She looked at him with cold astonishment but without fear Was he drunk
with aguardiente or had his jealousy turned his brain He continued
gasping but still pressing his hat against his breast

Ah he saw it all Yes it was today the day he left Yes she had
thought it safe to cast Miguel off nownow that HE was gone

Without in the least understanding him the color had leaped to her
cheek and the consciousness of it made her furious

How dare you she said passionately What has that stranger to do
with my affairs or your insolence

He stopped and gazed at her with a certain admiring loyalty Ah so
he said with a deep breath the senora is the niece of her uncle She
does well not to fear HIMa dogwith a slight shrugwho is more
than repaid by the senoras condescension HE dare not speak

Who dare not speak Are you mad She stopped with a sudden terrible
instinct of apprehension Miguel she said in her deepest voice
answer me I command you Do you know anything of this man

It was Miguels turn to recoil from his mistress Ah my God is it
possible the senora has not suspect

Suspect said Josephine haughtily albeit her proud heart was beating
quickly I SUSPECT nothing I command you to tell me what you KNOW

Miguel turned with a rapid gesture and closed the door Then drawing
her away from the window he said in a hurried whisper

I know that that man has not the name of Baxter I know that he has
the name of Randolph a young gambler who have won a large sum at
Sacramento and fearing to be robbed by those he won of have walk
to himself through the road in disguise of a miner I know that your
brother Esteban have decoyed him here and have fallen on him

Stop said the young girl her eyes which had been fixed with the
agony of conviction suddenly flashing with the energy of despair And
you call yourself the servant of my uncle and dare say this of his
nephew

Yes senora broke out the old man passionately It is because I am
the servant of your uncle that I and I ALONE dare say it to you It
is because I perjured my soul and have perjured my soul to deny it
elsewhere that I now dare to say it It is because I your servant
knew it from one of my countrymen who was of the gangbecause I
Miguel knew that your brother was not far away that night and because
I whom you would dismiss have picked up this pocketbook of Randolphs
and your brothers ring which he have dropped and I have found beneath
the body of the man you sent me to fetch

He drew a packet from his bosom and tossed it on the desk before her

And why have you not told me this before said Josephine
passionately

Miguel shrugged his shoulders

What good Possibly this dog Randolph would die Possibly he would
liveas a lunatic Possibly would happen what has happened The senora
is beautiful The American has eyes If the Dona Josephines beauty
shall finish what the silly Don Estebans arm have begunwhat matter

Stop cried Josephine pressing her hands across her shuddering eyes
Then uncovering her white and set face she said rapidly Saddle my
horse and your own at once Then take your choice Come with me and
repeat all that you have said in the presence of that man or leave this
ranch forever For if I live I shall go to him tonight and tell the
whole story

The old man cast a single glance at his mistress shrugged his
shoulders and without a word left the room But in ten minutes they
were on their way to the county town

Day was breaking over the distant Burnt Ridgea faint ghostly level
like a funeral pall in the dim horizonas they drew up before the
gaunt whitepainted pile of the hospital building Josephine uttered
a cry Dr Duchesnes buggy was before the door On its very threshold
they met the doctor dark and irritated Then you heard the news he
said quickly

Josephine turned her white face to the doctors What news she asked
in a voice that seemed strangely deep and resonant

The poor fellow had another attack last night and died of exhaustion
about an hour ago I was too late to save him

Did he say anything Was he conscious asked the girl hoarsely

No incoherent Now I think of it he harped on the same string as he
did the night of the operation What was it he said you remember

Youll have to kill me first repeated Josephine in a choking
voice

Yes something about his dying before hed tell Well he came back to
it before he went offthey often do You seem a little hoarse with your
morning ride You should take care of that voice of yours By the way
its a good deal like your brothers



The Chatelaine of Burnt Ridge never married




THROUGH THE SANTA CLARA WHEAT


CHAPTER I


It was an enormous wheatfield in the Santa Clara valley stretching to
the horizon line unbroken The meridian sun shone upon it without glint
or shadow but at times when a stronger gust of the trade winds passed
over it there was a quick slanting impression of the whole surface that
was however as unlike a billow as itself was unlike a sea Even when
a lighter zephyr played down its long level the agitation was
superficial and seemed only to momentarily lift a veil of greenish
mist that hung above its immovable depths Occasional puffs of dust
alternately rose and fell along an imaginary line across the field
as if a current of air were passing through it but were otherwise
inexplicable

Suddenly a faint shout apparently somewhere in the vicinity of the
line brought out a perfectly clear response followed by the audible
murmur of voices which it was impossible to localize Yet the whole
field was so devoid of any suggestion of human life or motion that
it seemed rather as if the vast expanse itself had become suddenly
articulate and intelligible

Wot say

Wheel off

Whare

In the road

One of the voices here indicated itself in the direction of the line of
dust and said Comin and a man stepped out from the wheat into a
broad and dusty avenue

With his presence three things became apparent

First that the puffs of dust indicated the existence of the invisible
avenue through the unlimited and unfenced field of grain secondly that
the stalks of wheat on either side of it were so tall as to actually
hide a passing vehicle and thirdly that a vehicle had just passed had
lost a wheel and been dragged partly into the grain by its frightened
horse which a dusty man was trying to restrain and pacify

The horse given up to equine hysterics and evidently convinced that
the ordinary buggy behind him had been changed into some dangerous and
appalling creation still plunged and kicked violently to rid himself
of it The man who had stepped out of the depths of the wheat quickly
crossed the road unhitched the traces drew back the vehicle and
glancing at the travelers dusty and disordered clothes said with curt
sympathy

Spilt too but not hurt eh

No neither of us I went over with the buggy when the wheel cramped
but SHE jumped clear

He made a gesture indicating the presence of another The man turned
quickly There was a second figure a young girl standing beside the
grain from which he had emerged embracing a few stalks of wheat with
one arm and a hand in which she still held her parasol while she
grasped her gathered skirts with the other and trying to find a secure
foothold for her two neat narrow slippers on a crumbling cake of adobe
above the fathomless dust of the roadway Her face although annoyed
and discontented was pretty and her light dress and slim figure were
suggestive of a certain superior condition

The mans manner at once softened with Western courtesy He swung
his broadbrimmed hat from his head and bent his body with the
ceremoniousness of the country ballroom I reckon the lady had better
come up to the shanty out o the dust and sun till we kin help you get
these things fixed he said to the driver Ill send round by the road
for your hoss and have one of mine fetch up your wagon

Is it far asked the girl slightly acknowledging his salutation
without waiting for her companion to reply

Only a step this way he answered motioning to the field of wheat
beside her

What in THERE I never could go in there she said decidedly

Its a heap shorter than by the road and not so dusty Ill go with
you and pilot you

The young girl cast a vexed look at her companion as the probable cause
of all this trouble and shook her head But at the same moment one
little foot slipped from the adobe into the dust again She instantly
clambered back with a little feminine shriek and ejaculated Well
of all things and then fixing her blue annoyed eyes on the stranger
asked impatiently Why couldnt I go there by the road n the wagon I
could manage to hold on and keep in

Because I reckon youd find it too powful hot waitin here till we got
round to ye

There was no doubt it was very hot the radiation from the baking
roadway beating up under her parasol and pricking her cheekbones and
eyeballs like needles She gave a fastidious little shudder furled her
parasol gathered her skirts still tighter faced about and said Go
on then The man slipped backwards into the ranks of stalks parting
them with one hand and holding out the other as if to lead her But
she evaded the invitation by holding her tightlydrawn skirt with both
hands and bending her head forward as if she had not noticed it The
next moment the road and even the whole outer world disappeared behind
them and they seemed floating in a choking green translucent mist

But the effect was only momentary a few steps further she found that
she could walk with little difficulty between the ranks of stalks which
were regularly spaced and the resemblance now changed to that of a long
pillared conservatory of greenish glass that touched all objects with
its pervading hue She also found that the close air above her head
was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower
temperature from belowas if the whole vast field had a circulation of
its ownand that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to
her tread There was no dust as he had said what had at first half
suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that
filled the narrow green aisles and now imparted a strange vigor and
excitement to her as she walked along Meantime her guide was not
conversationally idle Now no doubt she had never seen anything like
this before It was ordinary wheat only it was grown on adobe soilthe
richest in the valley These stalks she could see herself were ten and
twelve feet high That was the trouble they all ran too much to stalk
though the grain yield was suthen powful She could tell that to
her friends for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever
walked under such a growth Perhaps she was new to Californy He thought
so from the start Well this was Californy and this was not the least
of the ways it could lay over every other country on Gods yearth
Many folks thought it was the gold and the climate but she could see
for herself what it could do with wheat He wondered if her brother had
ever told her of it No the stranger wasnt her brother Nor cousin
nor company No only the hired driver from a San Jose hotel who was
takin her over to Major Randolphs Yes he knew the old major the
ranch was a pretty place nigh unto three miles further on Now that he
knew the driver was no relation of hers he didnt mind telling her that
the buggy was a rather old consarn and the driver didnt know his
business Yes it might be fixed up so as to take her over to the
majors there was one of their own mena young fellowwho could do
anything that COULD be done with wood and irona reglar geniusand
HED tackle it It might take an hour but shed find it quite cool
waiting in the shanty It was a rough place for they only camped out
there during the season to look after the crop and lived at their own
homes the rest of the time Was she going to stay long at the majors
He noticed she had not brought her trunk with her Had she known the
majors wife long Perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood

All this naive goodhumored questioningso often cruelly misunderstood
as mere vulgar curiosity but as often the courteous instinct of simple
unaffected people to entertain the stranger by inviting him to talk of
what concerns himself rather than their own selveswas nevertheless
I fear met only by monosyllables from the young lady or an impatient
question in return She scarcely raised her eyes to the broad
jeanshirted back that preceded her through the grain until the
man abruptly ceased talking and his manner without losing its
halfpaternal courtesy became graver She was beginning to be conscious
of her incivility and was trying to think of something to say when
he exclaimed with a slight air of relief Here we are and the shanty
suddenly appeared before them

It certainly was very rougha mere shell of unpainted boards that
scarcely rose above the level of the surrounding grain and a few yards
distant was invisible Its slightly sloping roof already warped and
shrunken into long fissures that permitted glimpses of the steelblue
sky above was evidently intended only as a shelter from the cloudless
sun in those two months of rainless days and dewless nights when it was
inhabited Through the open doors and windows she could see a row of
bunks or rude sleeping berths against the walls furnished with
coarse mattresses and blankets As the young girl halted the man
with an instinct of delicacy hurried forward entered the shanty and
dragging a rude bench to the doorway placed it so that she could sit
beneath the shade of the roof yet with her back to these domestic
revelations Two or three men who had been apparently lounging there
rose quietly and unobtrusively withdrew Her guide brought her a tin
cup of deliciously cool water exchanged a few hurried words with his
companions and then disappeared with them leaving her alone

Her first sense of relief from their company was I fear stronger than
any other feeling After a hurried glance around the deserted apartment
she arose shook out her dress and mantle and then going into the
darkest corner supported herself with one hand against the wall while
with the other she drew off one by one her slippers from her slim
stripedstockinged feet shook and blew out the dust that had penetrated
within and put them on again Then perceiving a triangular fragment
of lookingglass nailed against the wall she settled the strings of her
bonnet by the aid of its reflection patted the fringe of brown hair on
her forehead with her separated five fingers as if playing an imaginary
tune on her brow and came back with maidenly abstraction to the
doorway

Everything was quiet and her seclusion seemed unbroken A smile played
for an instant in the soft shadows of her eyes and mouth as she recalled
the abrupt withdrawal of the men Then her mouth straightened and her
brows slightly bent It was certainly very unmannerly in them to go off
in that way Good heavens couldnt they have stayed around without
talking Surely it didnt require four men to go and bring up that
wagon She picked up her parasol from the bench with an impatient
little jerk Then she held out her ungloved hand into the hot sunshine
beyond the door with the gesture she would have used had it been
raining and withdrew it as quicklyher hand quite scorched in
the burning rays Nevertheless after another impatient pause she
desperately put up her parasol and stepped from the shanty

Presently she was conscious of a faint sound of hammering not far away
Perhaps there was another shed but hidden like everything else in
this monotonous ridiculous grain Some stalks however were trodden
down and broken around the shanty she could move more easily and see
where she was going To her delight a few steps further brought her
into a current of the tradewind and a cooler atmosphere And a short
distance beyond them certainly was the shed from which the hammering
proceeded She approached it boldly

It was simply a roof upheld by rude uprights and crossbeams and open
to the breeze that swept through it At one end was a small blacksmiths
forge some machinery and what appeared to be part of a small
steamengine Midway of the shed was a closet or cupboard fastened with
a large padlock Occupying its whole length on the other side was a
workbench and at the further end stood the workman she had heard

He was apparently only a year or two older than herself and clad in
blue jean overalls blackened and smeared with oil and coaldust Even
his youthful face which he turned towards her had a black smudge
running across it and almost obliterating a small auburn moustache The
look of surprise that he gave her however quickly passed he remained
patiently and in a halfpreoccupied way holding his hammer in his
hand as she advanced This was evidently the young fellow who could do
anything that could be done with wood and iron

She was very sorry to disturb him but could he tell her how long it
would be before the wagon could be brought up and mended He could not
say that until he himself saw what was to be done if it was only a
matter of the wheel he could fix it up in a few moments if as he had
been told it was a case of twisted or bent axle it would take longer
but it would be here very soon Ah then would he let her wait here as
she was very anxious to know at once and it was much cooler than in the
shed Certainly he would go over and bring her a bench But here she
begged he wouldnt trouble himself she could sit anywhere comfortably

The lower end of the workbench was covered with clean and odorous
shavings she lightly brushed them aside and with a youthful movement
swung herself to a seat upon it supporting herself on one hand as
she leaned towards him She could thus see that his eyes were of a
lightyellowish brown like clarified honey with a singular look of
clear concentration in them which however was the same whether turned
upon his work the surrounding grain or upon her This and his sublime
unconsciousness of the smudge across his face and his blackened hands
made her wonder if the man who could do everything with wood and iron
was above doing anything with water She had half a mind to tell him of
it particularly as she noticed also that his throat below the line
of sunburn disclosed by his open collar was quite white and his grimy
hands well made She was wondering whether he would be affronted if she
said in her politest way I beg your pardon but do you know you
have quite accidentally got something on your face and offer her
handkerchief which of course he would decline when her eye fell on
the steamengine

How odd Do you use that on the farm

Nohe smiled here the smudge accenting it and setting off his white
teeth in a Christy Minstrel fashion that exasperated herno although
it COULD be used and had been But it was his first effort made two
years ago when he was younger and more inexperienced It was a rather
rough thing she could seebut he had to make it at odd times with
what iron he could pick up or pay for and at different forges where he
worked

She begged his pardonwhere

WHERE HE WORKED

Ah then he was the machinist or engineer here

No he worked here just like the others only he was allowed to put up a
forge while the grain was green and have his bench in consideration of
the odd jobs he could do in the way of mending tools etc There was
a heap of mending and welding to doshe had no idea how quickly
agricultural machines got out of order He had done much of his work on
the steamengine on moonlit nights Yes she had no idea how perfectly
clear and light it was here in the valley on such nights although of
course the shadows were very dark and when he dropped a screw or a nut
it was difficult to find He had worked there because it saved time
and because it didnt cost anything and he had nobody to look on or
interfere with him No it was not lonely the coyotes and wild cats
sometimes came very near but were always more surprised and frightened
than he was and once a horseman who had strayed off the distant road
yonder mistook him for an animal and shot at him twice

He told all this with such freedom from embarrassment and with such
apparent unconsciousness of the blue eyes that were following him and
the light graceful figurewhich was so near his own that in some
of his gestures his grimy hands almost touched its delicate
garmentsthat accustomed as she was to a certain masculine aberration
in her presence she was greatly amused by his naive acceptance of her
as an equal Suddenly looking frankly in her face he said

Ill show you a secret if you care to see it

Nothing would please her more

He glanced hurriedly around took a key from his pocket and unlocked
the padlock that secured the closet she had noticed Then reaching
within with infinite care he brought out a small mechanical model

Theres an invention of my own A reaper and thresher combined Im
going to have it patented and have a big one made from this model This
will work as you see

He then explained to her with great precision how as it moved over the
field the double operation was performed by the same motive power That
it would be a saving of a certain amount of labor and time which she
could not remember She did not understand a word of his explanations
she saw only a clean and pretty but complicated toy that under the
manipulation of his grimy fingers rattled a number of fraillike staves
and worked a number of wheels and drums yet there was no indication of
her ignorance in her sparkling eyes and smiling breathless attitude
Perhaps she was interested in his own absorption the revelation of
his preoccupation with this model struck her as if he had made her
a confidante of some boyish passion for one of her own sex and she
regarded him with the same sympathizing superiority

You will make a fortune out of it she said pleasantly

Well he might make enough to be able to go on with some other
inventions he had in his mind They cost money and time no matter how
careful one was

This was another interesting revelation to the young girl He not only
did not seem to care for the profit his devotion brought him but even
his one beloved ideal might be displaced by another So like a man
after all

Her reflections were broken upon by the sound of voices The young man
carefully replaced the model in its closet with a parting glance as if
he was closing a shrine and said There comes the wagon The young
girl turned to face the men who were dragging it from the road with
the halfcomplacent air of having been victorious over their late rude
abandonment but they did not seem to notice it or to be surprised
at her companion who quickly stepped forward and examined the broken
vehicle with workmanlike deliberation

I hope you will be able to do something with it she said sweetly
appealing directly to him I should thank you SO MUCH

He did not reply Presently he looked up to the man who had brought her
to the shanty and said The axles strained but its safe for five or
six miles more of this road Ill put the wheel on easily He paused
and without glancing at her continued You might send her on by the
cart

Pray dont trouble yourselves interrupted the young girl with a pink
uprising in her cheeks I shall be quite satisfied with the buggy as
it stands Send her on in the cart indeed Really they were a rude
setALL of them

Without taking the slightest notice of her remark the man replied
gravely to the young mechanic Yes but well be wanting the cart
before it can get back from taking her

Her again I assure you the buggy will serve perfectly wellif
thisgentlemanwill only be kind enough to put on the wheel again
she returned hotly

The young mechanic at once set to work The young girl walked apart
silently until the wheel was restored to its axle But to her surprise a
different horse was led forward to be harnessed

We thought your horse wasnt safe in case of another accident said
the first man with the same smileless consideration This one wouldnt
cut up if he was harnessed to an earthquake or a worse driver than
youve got

It occurred to her instantly that the more obvious remedy of sending
another driver had been already discussed and rejected by them Yet
when her own driver appeared a moment afterwards she ascended to her
seat with some dignity and a slight increase of color

I am very much obliged to you all she said without glancing at the
young inventor

Dont mention it miss

Good afternoon

Good afternoon They all took off their hats with the same formal
gravity as the horse moved forward but turned back to their work again
before she was out of the field


CHAPTER II


The ranch of Major Randolph lay on a rich falda of the Coast Range and
overlooked the great wheat plains that the young girl had just left
The house of wood and adobe buried to its first story in rosetrees
and passion vines was large and commodious Yet it contained only the
major his wife her son and daughter and the few occasional visitors
from San Francisco whom he entertained and she tolerated

For the majors household was not entirely harmonious While a young
infantry subaltern at a Gulf station he had been attracted by the
piquant foreign accent and dramatic gestures of a French Creole widow
andbelieving them in the first flush of his youthful passion more
than an offset to the encumbrance of her two children who with the
memory of various marital infidelities were all her late husband had
left herhad proposed been accepted and promptly married to her
Before he obtained his captaincy she had partly lost her accent and
those dramatic gestures which had accented the passion of their brief
courtship began to intensify domestic altercation and the bursts
of idle jealousy to which she was subject Whether she was revenging
herself on her second husband for the faults of her first is not known
but it was certain that she brought an unhallowed knowledge of the
weaknesses cheap cynicism and vanity of a foreign predecessor to sit
in judgment upon the simpleminded and chivalrous American soldier who
had succeeded him and who was in fact the most loyal of husbands The
natural result of her skepticism was an espionage and criticism of the
wives of the majors brother officers that compelled a frequent change
of quarters When to this was finally added a racial divergence and
antipathy the public disparagement of the customs and education of her
female colleagues and the sudden insistence of a foreign and French
dominance in her household beyond any ordinary Creole justification
Randolph presumably to avoid later international complications
resigned while he was as yet a major Luckily his latest banishment to
an extreme Western outpost had placed him in California during the flood
of a speculation epoch He purchased a valuable Spanish grant to three
leagues of land for little over a three months pay Following that
yearning which compels retired shipcaptains and rovers of all degrees
to buy a farm in their old days the major professionally and socially
inured to border strife sought surcease and Arcadian repose in
ranching

It was here that Mrs Randolph late relict of the late Scipion
LHommadieu devoted herself to bringing up her children after the
extremest of French methods and in resurrecting a de from her own
family to give a distinct and aristocratic character to their name The
de Fontanges lHommadieu were however only known to their neighbors
after the Western fashion by their stepfathers namewhen they were
known at allwhich was seldom For the boy was unpleasantly conceited
as a precocious worldling and the girl as unpleasantly complacent in
her role of ingenue The household was completely dominated by Mrs
Randolph A punctilious Catholic she attended all the functions of the
adjacent mission and the shadow of a black soutane at twilight gliding
through the wild oatfields behind the ranch had often been mistaken for
a coyote The peaceloving major did not object to a piety which while
it left his own conscience free imparted a respectable religious air to
his household and kept him from the equally distasteful approaches of
the Puritanism of his neighbors and was blissfully unconscious that he
was strengthening the antagonistic foreign element in his family with an
alien church

Meantime as the repaired buggy was slowly making its way towards his
house Major Randolph entered his wifes boudoir with a letter which the
San Francisco post had just brought him A look of embarrassment on his
goodhumored face strengthened the hard lines of hers she felt some
momentary weakness of her natural enemy and prepared to give battle

Im afraid heres something of a muddle Josephine he began with a
deprecating smile Mallory who was coming down here with his daughter
you know

This is the first intimation I have had that anything has been settled
upon interrupted the lady with appalling deliberation

However my dear you know I told you last week that he thought of
bringing her here while he went South on business You know being a
widower he has no one to leave her with

And I suppose it is the American fashion to intrust ones daughters to
any old boon companions

Mallory is an old friend interrupted the major impatiently He
knows Im married and although he has never seen YOU he is quite
willing to leave his daughter here

Thank you

Come you know what I mean The man naturally believes that my wife
will be a proper chaperone for his daughter But that is not the present
question He intended to call here I expected to take you over to San
Jose to see her and all that you know but the fact of it isthat
isit seems from this letter thathes been called away sooner than he
expected and thatwellhang it the girl is actually on her way here
now

Alone

I suppose so You know one thinks nothing of that here

Or any other propriety for that matter

For heavens sake Josephine dont be ridiculous Of course its
stupid her coming in this way and Mallory ought to have brought
herbut shes coming and we must receive her By Jove Here she is
now he added starting up after a hurried glance through the window
But what kind of a dd turnout is that anyhow

It certainly was an oddlooking conveyance that had entered the gates
and was now slowly coming up the drive towards the house A large
draught horse harnessed to a dustcovered buggy whose strained
foreaxle bent by the last mile of heavy road had slanted the tops
of the forewheels towards each other at an alarming angle The light
graceful dress and elegant parasol of the young girl who occupied half
of its single seat looked ludicrously pronounced by the side of the
slouching figure and grimy duster of the driver who occupied the other
half

Mrs Randolph gave a gritty laugh I thought you said she was alone Is
that an escort she has picked up American fashion on the road

Thats her hired driver no doubt Hang it she cant drive here by
herself retorted the major impatiently hurrying to the door and down
the staircase But he was instantly followed by his wife She had no
idea of permitting a possible understanding to be exchanged in their
first greeting The late M lHommadieu had been able to impart a whole
plan of intrigue in a single word and glance

Happily Rose Mallory already in the hall in a few words detailed the
accident that had befallen her to the honest sympathy of the major and
the coldlypolite concern of Mrs Randolph who in deliberately chosen
sentences managed to convey to the young girl the conviction that
accidents of any kind to young ladies were to be regarded as only
a shade removed from indiscretions Rose was impressed and even
flattered by the fastidiousness of this foreignappearing woman and
after the fashion of youthful natures accorded to her the respect due
to recognized authority When to this authority which was evident she
added a depreciation of the major I fear that some common instinct
of feminine tyranny responded in Roses breast and that on the very
threshold of the honest soldiers home she tacitly agreed with the wife
to look down upon him Mrs Randolph departed to inform her son and
daughter of their guests arrival As a matter of fact however they
had already observed her approach to the house through the slits of
their drawn windowblinds and those even narrower prejudices and
limited comprehensions which their education had fostered The girl
Adele had only grasped the fact that Rose had come to their house in
fine clothes alone with a man in a brokendown vehicle and was moved
to easy mirth and righteous wonder The young man Emile had agreed
with her with the mental reservation that the guest was pretty and
must eventually fall in love with him They both however welcomed her
with a trained politeness and a superficial attention that while the
indifference of her own countrymen in the wheatfield was still fresh in
her recollection struck her with grateful contrast the majors quiet
and unobtrusive kindliness naturally made less impression or was
accepted as a matter of course

Well said the major cheerfully but tentatively to his wife when
they were alone again she seems a nice girl after all and a good
deal of pluck and character by Jove to push on in that broken buggy
rather than linger or come in a farm cart eh

She was alone in that wheatfield said Mrs Randolph with grim
deliberation for half an hour she confesses it herselfTALKING WITH
A YOUNG MAN

Yes but the others had gone for the buggy And in the name of Heaven
what would you have her dohide herself in the grain said the major
desperately Besides he added with a recklessness he afterwards
regretted that mechanical chap theyve got there is really intelligent
and worth talking to

I have no doubt SHE thought so said Mrs Randolph with a mirthless
smile In fact I have observed that the American freedom generally
means doing what you WANT to do Indeed I wonder she didnt bring him
with her Only I beg major that you will not again in the presence
of my daughterand I may even say of my sontalk lightly of the
solitary meetings of young ladies with mechanics even though their
faces were smutty and their clothes covered with oil

The major here muttered something about there being less danger in a
young lady listening to the intelligence of a coarselydressed laborer
than to the compliments of a rosescented fop but Mrs Randolph walked
out of the room before he finished the evident platitude

That night Rose Mallory retired to her room in a state of
sellsatisfaction that she even felt was to a certain extent a virtue
She was delighted with her reception and with her hostess and family
It was strange her father had not spoken more of MRS Randolph who was
clearly the superior of his old friend What fine manners they all had
so different from other people she had known There was quite an Old
World civilization about them really it was like going abroad She
would make the most of her opportunity and profit by her visit She
would begin by improving her French they spoke it perfectly and with
such a pure accent She would correct certain errors she was conscious
of in her own manners and copy Mrs Randolph as much as possible
Certainly there was a great deal to be said of Mrs Randolphs way
of looking at things Now she thought of it calmly there WAS too much
informality and freedom in American ways There was not enough respect
due to position and circumstances Take those men in the wheatfield
for example Yet here she found it difficult to formulate an indictment
against them for freedom She would like to go there some day with the
Randolphs and let them see what company manners were She was thoroughly
convinced now that her father had done wrong in sending her alone it
certainly was most disrespectful to them and careless of him she had
quite forgotten that she had herself proposed to her father to go alone
rather than wait at the hotel and she must have looked very ridiculous
in her fine clothes and the brokendown buggy When her trunk came by
express tomorrow she would look out something more sober She must
remember that she was in a Catholic and religious household now Ah
yes how very fine it was to see that priest at dinner in his soutane
sitting down like one of the family and making them all seem like a
picture of some historical and aristocratic romance And then they were
actually de Fontanges lHommadieu How different he was from that
shabby Methodist minister who used to come to see her father in a black
cravat with a hideous bow Really there was something to say for a
religion that contained so much picturesque refinement and for her
partbut that will do I beg to say that I am not writing of any
particular snob or feminine monstrosity but of a very charming
creature who was quite able to say her prayers afterwards like a good
girl and lay her pretty cheek upon her pillow without a blush

She opened her window and looked out The moon a great silver dome
was uplifting itself from a bluishgray level which she knew was the
distant plain of wheat Somewhere in its midst appeared a dull star
at times brightening as if blown upon or drawn upwards in a cometlike
trail By some odd instinct she felt that it was the solitary forge
of the young inventor and pictured him standing before it with his
abstracted hazel eyes and a face more begrimed in the moonlight than
ever When DID he wash himself Perhaps not until Sunday How lonely it
must be out there She slightly shivered and turned from the window
As she did so it seemed to her that something knocked against her door
from without Opening it quickly she was almost certain that the sound
of a rustling skirt retreated along the passage It was very late
perhaps she had disturbed the house by shutting her window No doubt
it was the motherly interest of Mrs Randolph that impelled her to
come softly and look after her and for once her simple surmises were
correct For not only the inspecting eyes of her hostess but the
amatory glances of the youthful Emile had been fastened upon her window
until the light disappeared and even the Holy Mission Church of San
Jose had assured itself of the dear childs safety with a large and
supple ear at her keyhole

The next morning Major Randolph took her with Adele in a light cariole
over the ranch Although his domain was nearly as large as the adjoining
wheat plain it was not like that monopolized by one enormous
characteristic yield but embraced a more diversified product There
were acres and acres of potatoes in rows of endless and varying
succession there were miles of wild oats and barley which overtopped
them as they drove in narrow lanes of dry and dusty monotony there were
orchards of pears apricots peaches and nectarines and vineyards of
grapes so comparatively dwarfed in height that they scarcely reached
to the level of their eyes yet laden and breaking beneath the weight of
their ludicrously disproportionate fruit What seemed to be a vast green
plateau covered with tiny patches that headed the northern edge of
the prospect was an enormous bed of strawberry plants But everywhere
crossing the track bounding the fields orchards and vineyards
intersecting the paths of the whole domain were narrow irrigating ducts
and channels of running water

Those said the major poetically are the veins and arteries of
the ranch Come with me now and Ill show you its pulsating heart
Descending from the wagon into pedestrian prose again he led Rose a
hundred yards further to a shed that covered a wonderful artesian well
In the centre of a basin a column of water rose regularly with the even
flow and volume of a brook It is one of the largest in the State
said the major and is the life of all that grows here during six
months of the year

Pleased as the young girl was with those evidences of the prosperity and
position of her host she was struck however with the fact that the
farmlaborers winegrowers nurserymen and all field hands scattered
on the vast estate were apparently of the same independent unpastoral
and unprofessional character as the men of the wheatfield There were
no cottages or farm buildings that she could see nor any apparent
connection between the household and the estate far from suggesting
tenantry or retainers the men who were working in the fields glanced
at them as they passed with the indifference of strangers or replied to
the majors greetings or questionings with perfect equality of manner
or even businesslike reserve and caution Her host explained that the
ranch was worked by a company on shares that those laborers were in
fact the bulk of the company and that he the major only furnished
the land the seed and the implements That man who was driving the
long roller and with whom you were indignant because he wouldnt get
out of our way is the president of the company

That neednt make him so uncivil said Rose poutingly for if it
comes to that youre the LANDLORD she added triumphantly

No said the major goodhumoredly I am simply the man driving the
lighter and more easilymanaged team for pleasure and hes the man
driving the heavier and more difficult machine for work Its for me to
get out of his way and looked at in the light of my being THE LANDLORD
it is still worse for as were working on shares Im interrupting HIS
work and reducing HIS profits merely because I choose to sacrifice my
own

I need not say that those atrociously leveling sentiments were received
by the young ladies with that feminine scorn which is only qualified
by misconception Rose who under the influence of her hostess had a
vague impression that they sounded something like the French Revolution
and that Adele must feel like the Princess Elizabeth rushed to her
relief like a good girl But major now YOURE a gentleman and if
YOU had been driving that roller you know you would have turned out for
us

I dont know about that said the major mischievously but if I
had I should have known that the other fellow who accepted it wasnt a
gentleman

But Rose having sufficiently shown her partisanship in the discussion
after the feminine fashion did not care particularly for the logical
result After a moments silence she resumed And the wheat ranch
belowis that carried on in the same way

Yes But their landlord is a bank who advances not only the land but
the money to work it and doesnt ride around in a buggy with a couple
of charmingly distracting young ladies

And do they all share alike continued Rose ignoring the pleasantry
big and littlethat young inventor with the rest

She stopped She felt the ingenues usually complacent eyes suddenly
fixed upon her with an unhallowed precocity and as quickly withdrawn
Without knowing why she felt embarrassed and changed the subject

The next day they drove to the Convent of Santa Clara and the Mission
College of San Jose Their welcome at both places seemed to Rose to be a
mingling of caste greeting and spiritual zeal and the austere seclusion
and reserve of those cloisters repeated that suggestion of an Old World
civilization that had already fascinated the young Western girl They
made other excursions in the vicinity but did not extend it to a visit
to their few neighbors With their reserved and exclusive ideas this
fact did not strike Rose as peculiar but on a later shopping
expedition to the town of San Jose a certain reticence and aggressive
sensitiveness on the part of the shopkeepers and tradespeople towards
the Randolphs produced an unpleasant impression on her mind She could
not help noticing too that after the first stare of astonishment which
greeted her appearance with her hostess she herself was included in
the antagonism With her youthful prepossession for her friends this
distinction she regarded as flattering and aristocratic and I fear she
accented it still more by discussing with Mrs Randolph the merits
of the shopkeepers wares in schoolgirl French before them She was
unfortunate enough however to do this in the shop of a polyglot
German

Oxcoos me mees he said gravelybut dot lady speeks Engeleesh so
goot mit yourselluf and ven you dells to her dot silk is hallf gotton
in English she onderstand you mooch better and it dont make nodings
to me The laugh which would have followed from her own countrywomen
did not however break upon the trained faces of the de Fontanges
lHommadieus yet while Rose would have joined in it albeit a
little ruefully she felt for the first time mortified at their civil
insincerity

At the end of two weeks Major Randolph received a letter from Mr
Mallory When he had read it he turned to his wife He thanks you he
said for your kindness to his daughter and explains that his sudden
departure was owing to the necessity of his taking advantage of a great
opportunity for speculation that had offered As Mrs Randolph turned
away with a slight shrug of the shoulders the major continued But you
havent heard all That opportunity was the securing of a half interest
in a cinnabar lode in Sonora which has already gone up a hundred
thousand dollars in his hands By Jove a man can afford to drop a
little social ceremony on those termseh Josephine he concluded with
a triumphant chuckle

Hes as likely to lose his hundred thousand tomorrow while his
manners will remain said Mrs Randolph Ive no faith in these sudden
California fortunes

Youre wrong as regards Mallory for hes as careful as he is lucky He
dont throw money away for appearance sake or hed have a rich home for
that daughter He could afford it

Mrs Randolph was silent She is his only daughter I believe she
continued presently

Yeshe has no other kith or kin returned the major

She seems to be very much impressed by Emile said Mrs Randolph

Major Randolph faced his wife quickly

In the name of all thats ridiculous my dear you are not already
thinking ofhe gasped

I should be very loth to give MY sanction to anything of the kind
knowing the difference of her birth education and religionalthough
the latter I believe she would readily change said Mrs Randolph
severely But when you speak of MY already thinking of such things
do you suppose that your friend Mr Mallory didnt consider all that
when he sent that girl here

Never said the major vehemently and if it entered his head now by
Jove hed take her away tomorrowalways supposing I didnt anticipate
him by sending her off myself

Mrs Randolph uttered her mirthless laugh And you suppose the girl
would go Really major you dont seem to understand this boasted
liberty of your own countrywoman What does she care for her fathers
control Why shed make him do just what SHE wanted But she added
with an expression of dignity perhaps we had better not discuss this
until we know something of Emiles feelings in the matter That is the
only question that concerns us With this she swept out of the room
leaving the major at first speechless with honest indignation and
then after the fashion of all guileless natures a little uneasy and
suspicious of his own guilelessness For a day or two after he found
himself not without a sensation of meanness watching Rose when in
Emiles presence but he could distinguish nothing more than the frank
satisfaction she showed equally to the others Yet he found himself
regretting even that so subtle was the contagion of his wifes
suspicions


CHAPTER III


It had been a warm morning an unusual mist which the sun had not
dissipated had crept on from the great grainfields beyond and hung
around the house charged with a dry dusty closeness that seemed to be
quite independent of the suns rays and more like a heated exhalation
or emanation of the soil itself In its acrid irritation Rose thought
she could detect the breath of the wheat as on the day she had
plunged into its pale green shadows By the afternoon this mist had
disappeared apparently in the same mysterious manner but not scattered
by the usual tradewind whichanother unusual circumstancethat day
was not forthcoming There was a breathlessness in the air like the
hush of listening expectancy which filled the young girl with a vague
restlessness and seemed to even affect a scattered company of crows
in the field beyond the house which rose suddenly with startled but
aimless wings and then dropped vacantly among the grain again

Major Randolph was inspecting a distant part of the ranch Mrs Randolph
was presumably engaged in her boudoir and Rose was sitting between
Adele and Emile before the piano in the drawingroom listlessly
turning over the leaves of some music There had been an odd mingling of
eagerness and abstraction in the usual attentions of the young man that
morning and a certain nervous affectation in his manner of twisting the
ends of a small black moustache which resembled his mothers eyebrows
that had affected Rose with a halfamused halfuneasy consciousness
but which she had however referred to the restlessness produced by the
weather It occurred to her also that the vacuously amiable Adele had
once or twice regarded her with the same precocious childlike curiosity
and infantine cunning she had once before exhibited All this did not
however abate her admiration for bothperhaps particularly for this
picturesquely gentlemanly young fellow with his gentle audacities
of compliment his caressing attentions and his unfailing and equal
address And when discovering that she had mislaid her fan for the
fifth time that morning he started up with equal and undiminished fire
to go again and fetch it the look of grateful pleasure and pleading
perplexity in her pretty eyes might have turned a less conceited brain
than his

But you dont know where it is

I shall find it by instinct

You are spoiling meyou two The parenthesis was a hesitating
addition but she continued with fresh sincerity I shall be quite
helpless when I leave hereif I am ever able to go by myself

Dont ever go then

But just now I want my fan it is so close everywhere today

I fly mademoiselle

He started to the door

She called after him

Let me help your instinct then I had it last in the majors study

That was where I was going

He disappeared Rose got up and moved uneasily towards the window How
queer and quiet it looks outside Its really too bad that he should be
sent after that fan again Hell never find it She resumed her place
at the piano Adele following her with round expectant eyes After a
pause she started up again Ill go and fetch it myself she said
with a halfembarrassed laugh and ran to the door

Scarcely understanding her own nervousness but finding relief in rapid
movement Rose flew lightly up the staircase The majors study where
she had been writing letters during his absence that morning was at
the further end of a long passage and near her own bedroom the door of
which as she passed she noticed halfabstractedly was open but she
continued on and hurriedly entered the study At the same moment Emile
with a smile on his face turned towards her with the fan in his hand

Oh youve found it she said with nervous eagerness I was so
afraid youd have all your trouble for nothing

She extended her hand with a halfbreathless smile for the fan but he
caught her outstretched little palm in his own and held it

Ah but you are not going to leave us are you

In a flash of consciousness she understood him and as it seemed to
her her own nervousness and all and everything And with it came a
swift appreciation of all it meant to her and her future To be
always with him and like him a part of this refined and restful
seclusionakin to all that had so attracted her in this house not to
be obliged to educate herself up to it but to be in it on equal terms
at once to know that it was no wild foolish youthful fancy but a
wise thoughtful and prudent resolve that her father would understand
and her friends respect these were the thoughts that crowded quickly
upon her more like an explanation of her feelings than a revelation in
the brief second that he held her hand It was not perhaps love as
she had dreamed it and even BELIEVED it before She was not ashamed
or embarrassed she even felt with a slight pride that she was not
blushing She raised her eyes frankly What she WOULD have said she did
not know for the door which he had closed behind her began to shake
violently

It was not the fear of some angry intrusion or interference surely that
made him drop her hand instantly It was nother second thoughtthe
idea that some one had fallen in a fit against it that blanched his face
with abject and unreasoning terror It must have been something else
that caused him to utter an inarticulate cry and dash out of the room
and down the stairs like a madman What had happened

In her own selfpossession she knew that all this was passing rapidly
that it was not the door now that was still shaking for it had swung
almost shut againbut it was the windows the bookshelves the floor
beneath her feet that were all shaking She heard a hurried scrambling
the trampling of feet below and the quick rustling of a skirt in the
passage as if some one had precipitately fled from her room Yet no one
had called to hereven HE had said nothing Whatever had happened they
clearly had not cared for her to know

The jarring and rattling ceased as suddenly but the house seemed silent
and empty She moved to the door which had now swung open a few inches
but to her astonishment it was fixed in that position and she could not
pass As yet she had been free from any personal fear and even now it
was with a half smile at her imprisonment in the majors study that she
rang the bell and turned to the window A man whom she recognized
as one of the ranch laborers was standing a hundred feet away in the
garden looking curiously at the house He saw her face as she tried to
raise the sash uttered an exclamation and ran forward But before she
could understand what he said the sash began to rattle in her hand the
jarring recommenced the floor shook beneath her feet a hideous sound
of grinding seemed to come from the walls a thin seam of dustlike
smoke broke from the ceiling and with the noise of falling plaster a
dozen books followed each other from the shelves in what in the frantic
hurry of that moment seemed a grimly deliberate succession a picture
hanging against the wall to her dazed wonder swung forward and
appeared to stand at right angles from it she felt herself reeling
against the furniture a deadly nausea overtook her as she glanced
despairingly towards the window the outlying fields beyond the garden
seemed to be undulating like a sea For the first time she raised her
voice not in fear but in a pathetic little cry of apology for her
awkwardness in tumbling about and not being able to grapple this new
experience and then she found herself near the door which had once
more swung free She grasped it eagerly and darted out of the study
into the deserted passage Here some instinct made her follow the line
of the wall rather than the shaking balusters of the corridor and
staircase but before she reached the bottom she heard a shout and
the farm laborer she had seen coming towards her seized her by the arm
dragged her to the open doorway of the drawingroom and halted beneath
its arch in the wall Another thrill but lighter than before passed
through the building then all was still again

Its over I reckon thats all just now said the man coolly Its
quite safe to cut and run for the garden now through this window He
half led half lifted her through the French window to the veranda and
the ground and locking her arm in his ran quickly forward a hundred
feet from the house stopping at last beneath a large post oak where
there was a rustic seat into which she sank Youre safe now I
reckon he said grimly

She looked towards the house the sun was shining brightly a cool
breeze seemed to have sprung up as they ran She could see a quantity of
rubbish lying on the roof from which a dozen yards of zinc gutter
were perilously hanging the broken shafts of the further cluster of
chimneys a pile of bricks scattered upon the ground and among the
battered down beams of the end of the verandabut that was all She
lifted her now whitened face to the man and with the apologetic smile
still lingering on her lips asked

What does it all mean What has happened

The man stared at her Dye mean to say ye dont know

How could I They must have all left the house as soon as it began I
was talking toto M lHommadieu and he suddenly left

The man brought his face angrily down within an inch of her own Dye
mean to say that them dd French halfbreeds stampeded and left yer
there alone

She was still too much stupefied by the reaction to fully comprehend
his meaning and repeated feebly with her smile still faintly lingering
But you dont tell me WHAT it was

An earthquake said the man roughly and if it had lasted ten
seconds longer it would have shook the whole shanty down and left you
under it Yer kin tell that to them if they dont know it but from the
way they made tracks to the fields I reckon they did Theyre coming
now

Without another word he turned away half surlily half defiantly
passing scarce fifty yards away Mrs Randolph and her daughter who were
hastening towards their guest

Oh here you are said Mrs Randolph with the nearest approach to
effusion that Rose had yet seen in her manner We were wondering where
you had run to and were getting quite concerned Emile was looking for
you everywhere

The recollection of his blank and abject face his vague outcry and
blind fright came back to Rose with a shock that sent a flash of
sympathetic shame to her face The ingenious Adele noticed it and
dutifully pinched her mothers arm

Emile echoed Rose faintlylooking for ME

Mother and daughter exchanged glances

Yes said Mrs Randolph cheerfully he says he started to run with
you but you got ahead and slipped out of the garden dooror something
of the kind she added with the air of making light of Roses girlish
fears You know one scarcely knows what one does at such times and
it must have been frightfully strange to YOUand hes been quite
distracted lest you should have wandered away Adele run and tell him
Miss Mallory has been here under the oak all the time

Rose startedand then fell hopelessly back in her seat Perhaps it WAS
true Perhaps he had not rushed off with that awful face and without a
word Perhaps she herself had been halffrightened out of her reason
In the simple weak kindness of her nature it seemed less dreadful to
believe that the fault was partly her own

And you went back into the house to look for us when all was over
said Mrs Randolph fixing her black beady magnetic eyes on Rose and
that stupid yokel Zake brought you out again He neednt have clutched
your arm so closely my dearI must speak to the major about his
excessive familiaritybut I suppose I shall be told that that is
American freedom I call it a liberty

It struck Rose that she had not even thanked the manin the same flash
that she remembered something dreadful that he had said She covered her
face with her hands and tried to recall herself

Mrs Randolph gently tapped her shoulder with a mixture of maternal
philosophy and discipline and continued Of course its an upsetand
youre confused still Thats nothing They say dear its perfectly
well known that no two peoples recollections of these things ever are
the same Its really ridiculous the contradictory stories one hears
Isnt it Emile

Rose felt that the young man had joined them and was looking at her In
the fear that she should still see some trace of the startled selfish
animal in his face she did not dare to raise her eyes to his but
looked at his mother Mrs Randolph was standing then collected but
impatient

Its all over now said Emile in his usual voice and except the
chimneys and some fallen plaster theres really no damage done But
Im afraid they have caught it pretty badly at the mission and at San
Francisco in those tall flashy rattletrap buildings theyre putting
up Ive just sent off one of the men for news

Her father was in San Francisco by that time and she had never thought
of him In her quick remorse she now forgot all else and rose to her
feet

I must telegraph to my father at once she said hurriedly he is
there

You had better wait until the messenger returns and hear his news
said Emile If the shock was only a slight one in San Francisco your
father might not understand you and would be alarmed

She could see his face nowthere was no record of the past expression
upon it but he was watching her eagerly Mrs Randolph and Adele had
moved away to speak to the servants Emile drew nearer

You surely will not desert us now he said in a low voice

Please dont she said vaguely Im so worried and pushing quickly
past him she hurriedly rejoined the two women

They were superintending the erection of a long tent or marquee in the
garden hastily extemporized from the awnings of the veranda and other
cloth Mrs Randolph explained that although all danger was over there
was the possibility of the recurrence of lighter shocks during the day
and night and that they would all feel much more secure and comfortable
to camp out for the next twentyfour hours in the open air

Only imagine youre picnicking and youll enjoy it as most people
usually enjoy those horrid al fresco entertainments I dont believe
theres the slightest real necessity for it but she added in a lower
voice the Irish and Chinese servants are so demoralized now they
wouldnt stay indoors with us Its a common practice here I believe
for a day or two after the shock and it gives time to put things right
again and clear up The old onestoried Spanish houses with walls
three feet thick and built round a courtyard or patio were much safer
Its only when the Americans try to improve upon the old order of things
with their pinchbeck shams and stucco that Providence interferes like
this to punish them

It was the fact however that Rose was more impressed by what seemed to
her the absolute indifference of Providence in the matter and the cool
resumption by Nature of her ordinary conditions The sky above their
heads was as rigidly blue as ever and as smilingly monotonous the
distant prospect with its clear wellknown silhouettes had not
changed the crows swung on lazy deliberate wings over the grain as
before and the tradewind was again blowing in its quiet persistency
And yet she knew that something had happened that would never again make
her enjoyment of the prospect the samethat nothing would ever be as
it was yesterday I think at first she referred only to the material and
larger phenomena and did not confound this revelation of the insecurity
of the universe with her experience of man Yet the fact also remained
that to the conservative correct and as she believed secure
condition to which she had been approximating all her relations were
rudely shaken and upset It really seemed to this simpleminded young
woman that the revolutionary disturbance of settled conditions might
have as Providential an origin as the Divine Right of which she had
heard so much


CHAPTER IV


In her desire to be alone and to evade the now significant attentions
of Emile she took advantage of the bustle that followed the hurried
transfer of furniture and articles from the house to escape through the
garden to the outlying fields Striking into one of the dusty lanes that
she remembered she wandered on for half an hour until her progress and
meditation were suddenly arrested She had come upon a long chasm or
crack in the soil full twenty feet wide and as many in depth crossing
her path at right angles She did not remember having seen it before
the track of wheels went up to its precipitous edge she could see
the track on the other side but the hiatus remained unbridged and
uncovered It was not there yesterday She glanced right and left the
fissure seemed to extend like a moat or ditch from the distant road to
the upland between her and the great wheat valley below from which she
was shut off An odd sense of being in some way a prisoner confronted
her She drew back with an impatient start and perhaps her first real
sense of indignation A voice behind her which she at once recognized
scarcely restored her calmness

You cant get across there miss

She turned It was the young inventor from the wheat ranch on horseback
and with a clean face He had just ridden out of the grain on the same
side of the chasm as herself

But you seem to have got over she said bluntly

Yes but it was further up the field I reckoned that the split might
be deeper but not so broad in the rock outcrop over there than in the
adobe here I found it so and jumped it

He looked as if he mightalert intelligent and selfcontained He
lingered a moment and then continued

Im afraid you must have been badly shaken and a little frightened up
there before the chimneys came down

No she was glad to say briefly and she believed truthfully I wasnt
frightened I didnt even know it was an earthquake

Ah he reflected that was because you were a stranger Its
oddtheyre all like that I suppose its because nobody really expects
or believes in the unlookedfor thing and yet thats the thing that
always happens And then of course that other affair which really is
serious startled you the more

She felt herself ridiculously and angrily blushing I dont know what
you mean she said icily What other affair

Why the well

The well she repeated vacantly

Yes the artesian well has stopped Didnt the major tell you

No said the girl He was away I havent seen him yet

Well the flow of water has ceased completely Thats what Im here
for The major sent for me and Ive been to examine it

And is that stoppage so very important she said dubiously

It was his turn to look at her wonderingly

If its LOST entirely it means ruin for the ranch he said sharply
He wheeled his horse nodded gravely and trotted off

Major Randolphs figure of the lifeblood of the ranch flashed across
her suddenly She knew nothing of irrigation or the costly appliances
by which the Californian agriculturist opposed the long summer droughts
She only vaguely guessed that the dreadful earthquake had struck at the
prosperity of those people whom only a few hours ago she had been proud
to call her friends The underlying goodness of her nature was touched
Should she let a momentary faultif it were not really after all
only a misunderstandingrise between her and them at such a moment She
turned and hurried quickly towards the house

Hastening onward she found time however to wonder also why
these common menshe now included even the young inventor in that
categorywere all so rude and uncivil to HER She had never before
been treated in this way she had always been rather embarrassed by the
admiring attentions of young men clerks and collegians in her Atlantic
home and of professional men merchants and stockbrokers in San
Francisco It was true that they were not as continually devoted to her
and to the nice art and etiquette of pleasing as Emilethey had other
things to think about being in business and not being GENTLEMENbut
then they were greatly superior to these clowns who took no notice of
her and rode off without lingering or formal leavetaking when their
selfish affairs were concluded It must be the contact of the vulgar
earththis wretched cracking material and yet ungovernable and
lawless earththat so depraved them She felt she would like to say
this to some onenot her father for he wouldnt listen to her nor to
the major who would laughingly argue with her but to Mrs Randolph
who would understand her and perhaps say it some day in her own
sharp sneering way to these very clowns With those gentle sentiments
irradiating her blue eyes and putting a pink flush upon her fair
cheeks Rose reached the garden with the intention of rushing
sympathetically into Mrs Randolphs arms But it suddenly occurred
to her that she would be obliged to state how she became aware of this
misfortune and with it came an instinctive aversion to speak of her
meeting with the inventor She would wait until Mrs Randolph told her
But although that lady was engaged in a lowvoiced discussion in French
with Emile and Adele which instantly ceased at her approach there was
no allusion made to the new calamity You need not telegraph to your
father she said as Rose approached he has already telegraphed to you
for news as you were out and the messenger was waiting an answer we
opened the dispatch and sent one telling him that you were all right
and that he need not hurry here on your account So you are satisfied
I hope A few hours ago this would have been true and Rose would have
probably seen in the action of her hostess only a flattering motherly
supervision there was in fact still a lingering trace of trust in her
mind yet she was conscious that she would have preferred to answer the
dispatch herself and to have let her father come To a girl brought
up with a belief in the right of individual independence of thought and
action there was something in Mrs Randolphs practical ignoring of
that right which startled her in spite of her new conservatism while
as the daughter of a business man her instincts revolted against Mrs
Randolphs unbusinesslike action with the telegram however vulgar and
unrefined she may have begun to consider a life of business The
result was a certain constraint and embarrassment in her manner which
however had the laudable effect of limiting Emiles attention to
significant glances and was no doubt variously interpreted by the
others But she satisfied her conscience by determining to make a
confidence of her sympathy to the major on the first opportunity

This she presently found when the others were preoccupied the major
greeting her with a somewhat careworn face but a voice whose habitual
kindness was unchanged When he had condoled with her on the terrifying
phenomenon that had marred her visit to the ranchand she could not
help impatiently noticing that he too seemed to have accepted his wifes
theory that she had been half deliriously frightenedhe regretted that
her father had not concluded to come down to the ranch as his practical
advice would have been invaluable in this emergency She was about to
eagerly explain why when it occurred to her that Mrs Randolph had only
given him a suppressed version of the telegram and that she would be
betraying her or again taking sides in this partisan divided home
With some hesitation she at last alluded to the accident to the artesian
well The major did not ask her how she had heard of it it was a bad
business he thought but it might not be a total loss The water may
have been only diverted by the shock and might be found again at the
lower level or in some lateral fissure He had sent hurriedly for Tom
Bentthat clever young engineer at the wheat ranch who was always
studying up these things with his inventionsand that was his opinion
No Tom was not a welldigger but it was generally known that he had
located one or two and had long ago advised the tapping of that flow
by a second boring in case of just such an emergency He was coming
again tomorrow By the way he had asked how the young lady visitor
was and hoped she had not been alarmed by the earthquake

Rose felt herself again blushing and what was more singular with an
unexpected and it seemed to her ridiculous pleasure although outwardly
she appeared to ignore the civility completely And she had no
intention of being so easily placated If this young man thought by mere
perfunctory civilities to her HOST to make up for his clownishness to
HER he was mistaken She would let him see it when he called tomorrow
She quickly turned the subject by assuring the major of her sympathy and
her intention of sending for her father For the rest of the afternoon
and during their al fresco dinner she solved the difficulty of her
strained relations with Mrs Randolph and Emile by conversing chiefly
with the major tacitly avoiding however any allusion to this Mr
Bent But Mrs Randolph was less careful

You dont really mean to say major she began in her dryest
grittiest manner that instead of sending to San Francisco for some
skilled mastermechanic you are going to listen to the vagaries of a
conceited halfeducated farmlaborer and employ him You might as well
call in some of those wizards or waterwitches at once But the major
like many other wellmanaged husbands who are goodhumoredly content
to suffer in the sunshine of prosperity had no idea of doing so in
adversity and the prospect of being obliged to go back to youthful
struggles had recalled some of the independence of that period He
looked up quietly and said

If his conclusions are as clear and satisfactory tomorrow as they were
today I shall certainly try to secure his services

Then I can only say I would prefer the waterwitch He at least
would not represent a class of neighbors who have made themselves
systematically uncivil and disagreeable to us

I am afraid Josephine we have not tried to make ourselves
particularly agreeable to THEM said the major

If that can only be done by admitting their equality I prefer they
should remain uncivil Only let it be understood major that if you
choose to take this Tomtheploughboy to mend your well you will at
least keep him there while he is on the property

With what retort the major would have kept up this conjugal discussion
already beginning to be awkward to the discreet visitor is not known
as it was suddenly stopped by a bullet from the rosebud lips of the
ingenuous Adele

Why hes very handsome when his face is clean and his hands are small
and not at all hard And he doesnt talk the least bit queer or common

There was a dead silence And pray where did YOU see him and what do
you know about his hands asked Mrs Randolph in her most desiccated
voice Or has the major already presented you to him I shouldnt be
surprised

No buthesitated the young girl with a certain mouselike
audacitywhen you sent me to look after Miss Mallory I came up to
him just after he had spoken to her and he stopped to ask me how we all
were and if Miss Mallory was really frightened by the earthquake and
he shook hands for good afternoonthats all

And who taught you to converse with common strangers and shake hands
with them continued Mrs Randolph with narrowing lips

Nobody mamma but I thought if Miss Mallory who is a young lady
could speak to him so could I who am not out yet

We wont discuss this any further at present said Mrs Randolph
stiffly as the major smiled grimly at Rose The earthquake seems to
have shaken down in this house more than the chimneys

It certainly had shaken all power of sleep from the eyes of Rose when
the household at last dispersed to lie down in their clothes on
the mattresses which had been arranged under the awnings She was
continually starting up from confused dreams of the ground shaking under
her or she seemed to be standing on the brink of some dreadful abyss
like the great chasm on the grainfield when it began to tremble and
crumble beneath her feet It was near morning when unable to endure
it any longer she managed without disturbing the sleeping Adele
who occupied the same curtained recess with her to slip out from
the awning Wrapped in a thick shawl she made her way through the
encompassing trees and bushes of the garden that had seemed to imprison
and suffocate her to the edge of the grainfield where she could
breathe the fresh air beneath an open starlit sky There was no moon
and the darkness favored her she had no fears that weighed against the
horror of seclusion with her own fancies Besides they were camping
OUT of the house and if she chose to sit up or walk about no one could
think it strange She wished her father were here that she might have
some one of her own kin to talk to yet she knew not what to say to him
if he had come She wanted somebody to sympathize with her feelingsor
rather perhaps some one to combat and even ridicule the uneasiness
that had lately come over her She knew what her father would sayDo
you want to go or do you want to stay here Do you like these people
or do you not She remembered the one or two glowing and enthusiastic
accounts she had written him of her visit here and felt herself
blushing again What would he think of Mrs Randolphs opening and
answering the telegram Wouldnt he find out from the major if she had
garbled the sense of his dispatch

Away to the right in the midst of the distant and invisible
wheatfield there was the same intermittent star which like a living
breathing thing seemed to dilate in glowing respiration as she had seen
it the first night of her visit Mr Bents forge It must be nearly
daylight now the poor fellow had been up all night or else was
stealing this early march on the day She recalled Adeles sudden
eulogium of him The first natural smile that had come to her lips since
the earthquake broke up her nervous restraint and sent her back more
like her old self to her couch

But she had not proceeded far towards the tent when she heard the sound
of low voices approaching her It was the major and his wife who like
herself had evidently been unable to sleep and were up betimes A new
instinct of secretiveness which she felt was partly the effect of her
artificial surrounding checked her first natural instinct to call to
them and she drew back deeper in the shadow to let them pass But to
her great discomfiture the major in a conversational emphasis stopped
directly in front of her

You are wrong I tell you a thousand times wrong The girl is simply
upset by this earthquake Its a great pity her father didnt come
instead of telegraphing And by Jove rather than hear any more of
this Ill send for him myself said the major in an energetic but
suppressed voice

And the girl wont thank you and youll be a fool for your pains
returned Mrs Randolph with dry persistency

But according to your own ideas of propriety Mallory ought to be the
first one to be consultedand by me too

Not in this case Of course before any actual engagement is on you
can speak of Emiles attentions

But suppose Mallory has other views Suppose he declines the honor The
man is no fool

Thank you But for that very reason he must Listen to me major if he
doesnt care to please his daughter for her own sake he will have to
do so for the sake of decency Yes I tell you she has thoroughly
compromised herselfquite enough if it is ever known to spoil any
other engagement her father may make Why ask Adele The day of the
earthquake she ABSOLUTELY had the audacity to send him out of the room
upstairs into your study for her fan and then follow him up there
alone The servants knew it I knew it for I was in her room at the
time with Father Antonio The earthquake made it plain to everybody
Decline it No Mr Mallory will think twice about it before he does
that Whats that Whos there

There was a sudden rustle in the bushes like the passage of some
frightened animaland then all was still again


CHAPTER V


The sun an hour high but only just topping the greenish crests of the
wheat was streaming like the morning breeze through the open length of
Tom Bents workshed An exaggerated and prolonged shadow of the young
inventor himself at work beside his bench was stretching itself far into
the brokendown ranks of stalks towards the invisible road and falling
at the very feet of Rose Mallory as she emerged from them

She was very pale very quiet and very determined The traveling mantle
thrown over her shoulders was dusty the ribbons that tied her hat under
her round chin had become unloosed She advanced walking down the line
of shadow directly towards him

I am afraid I will have to trouble you once more she said with a
faint smile which did not however reach her perplexed eyes Could
you give me any kind of a conveyance that would take me to San Jose at
once

The young man had started at the rustling of her dress in the shavings
and turned eagerly The faintest indication of a loss of interest was
visible for an instant in his face but it quickly passed into a smile
of recognition Yet she felt that he had neither noticed any change in
her appearance nor experienced any wonder at seeing her there at that
hour

I did not take a buggy from the house she went on quickly for I
left early and did not want to disturb them In fact they dont know
that I am gone I was worried at not hearing news from my father in San
Francisco since the earthquake and I thought I would run down to San
Jose to inquire without putting them to any trouble Anything will do
that you have ready if I can take it at once

Still without exhibiting the least surprise Bent nodded affirmatively
put down his tools begged her to wait a moment and ran off in the
direction of the cabin As he disappeared behind the wheat she lapsed
quite suddenly against the work bench but recovered herself a moment
later leaning with her back against it her hands grasping it on either
side and her knit brows and determined little face turned towards the
road Then she stood erect again shook the dust out of her skirts
lifted her veil wiped her cheeks and brow with the corner of a small
handkerchief and began walking up and down the length of the shed as
Bent reappeared

He was accompanied by the man who had first led her through the wheat
He gazed upon her with apparently all the curiosity and concern that the
other had lacked

You want to get to San Jose as quick as you can he said
interrogatively

Yes she said quickly if you can help me

You walked all the way from the majors here he continued without
taking his eyes from her face

Yes she answered with an affectation of carelessness she had not
shown to Bent But I started very early it was cool and pleasant and
didnt seem far

Ill put you down in San Jose inside the hour You shall have my horse
and trotting sulky and Ill drive you myself Will that do

She looked at him wonderingly She had not forgotten his previous
restraint and gravity but now his face seemed to have relaxed with some
humorous satisfaction She felt herself coloring slightly but whether
with shame or relief she could not tell

I shall be so much obliged to you she replied hesitatingly and so
will my father I know

I reckon said the man with the same look of amused conjecture then
with a quick assuring nod he turned away and dived into the wheat
again

Youre all right now Miss Mallory said Bent complacently Dawson
will fix it Hes got a good horse and hes a good driver too He
paused and then added pleasantly I suppose theyre all well up at the
house

It was so evident that his remark carried no personal meaning to herself
that she was obliged to answer carelessly Oh yes

I suppose you see a good deal of Miss RandolphMiss Adele I think
you call her he remarked tentatively and with a certain boyish
enthusiasm which she had never conceived possible to his nature

Yes she replied a little dryly she is the only young lady there
She stopped remembering Adeles naive description of the man before
her and said abruptly You know her then

A little replied the young man modestly I see her pretty often
when I am passing the upper end of the ranch Shes very well brought
up and her manners are very refineddont you think soand yet shes
just as simple and natural as a country girl Theres a great deal
in education after all isnt there he went on confidentially and
althoughhe lowered his voice and looked cautiously around himI
believe that some of us here dont fancy her mother much theres no
doubt that Mrs Randolph knows how to bring up her children Some people
think that kind of education is all artificial and dont believe in it
but I do

With the consciousness that she was running away from these people and
the shameful disclosure she had heard last nightwith the recollection
of Adeles scandalous interpretation of her most innocent actions and
her sudden and complete revulsion against all that she had previously
admired in that household to hear this man who had seemed to her a
living protest against their ideas and principles now expressing them
and holding them up for emulation almost took her breath away

I suppose that means you intend to fix Major Randolphs well for him
she said dryly

Yes he returned without noticing her manner and I think I can find
that water again Ive been studying it up all night and do you know
what Im going to do I am going to make the earthquake that lost it
help me to find it again He paused and looked at her with a smile
and a return of his former enthusiasm Do you remember the crack in the
adobe field that stopped you yesterday

Yes said the girl with a slight shiver

I told you then that the same crack was a split in the rock outcrop
further up the plain and was deeper I am satisfied now from what I
have seen that it is really a rupture of the whole strata all the way
down Thats the one weak point that the imprisoned water is sure to
find and thats where the borer will tap itin the new well that the
earthquake itself has sunk

It seemed to her now that she understood his explanation perfectly and
she wondered the more that he had been so mistaken in his estimate of
Adele She turned away a little impatiently and looked anxiously towards
the point where Dawson had disappeared Bent followed her eyes

Hell be here in a moment Miss Mallory He has to drive slowly through
the grain but I hear the wheels He stopped and his voice took up its
previous note of boyish hesitation By the wayIllIll be going up
to the Rancho this afternoon to see the major Have you any message for
Mrs Randolphor forfor Miss Adele

Nosaid Rose hesitatingly andand

I see interrupted Bent carelessly You dont want anything said
about your coming here I wont

It struck her that he seemed to have no ulterior meaning in the
suggestion But before she could make any reply Dawson reappeared
driving a handsome mare harnessed to a light spiderlike vehicle He
had also assumed evidently in great haste a black frock coat buttoned
over his waistcoatless and cravatless shirt and a tall black hat that
already seemed to be cracking in the sunlight He drove up at once
assisted her to the narrow perch beside him and with a nod to Bent
drove off His breathless expedition relieved the leavetaking of these
young people of any ceremony

I suppose said Mr Dawson giving a half glance over his shoulder as
they struck into the dusty highwayI suppose you dont care to see
anybody before you get to San Jose

Nooo said Rose timidly

And I reckon you wouldnt mind my racin a bit if anybody kem up

No

The mares sort o fastidious about takin anybodys dust

Is she said Rose with a faint smile

Awful responded her companion and the queerest thing of all is she
cant bear to have any one behind her either

He leaned forward with his expression of humorous enjoyment of some
latent joke and did something with the reinsRose never could clearly
understand what though it seemed to her that he simply lifted them with
ostentatious lightness but the mare suddenly seemed to LENGTHEN herself
and lose her height and the stalks of wheat on either side of the dusty
track began to melt into each other and then slipped like a flash into
one long continuous shimmering green hedge So perfect was the mares
action that the girl was scarcely conscious of any increased effort so
harmonious the whole movement that the light skeleton wagon seemed only
a prolonged process of that long slim body and free collarless neck
both straight as the thin shafts on each side and straighter than the
delicate ribbonlike traces which in what seemed a mere affectation of
conscious power hung at times almost limp between the whiffletree and
the narrow breast band which was all that confined the animals powerful
forequarters So superb was the reach of its long easy stride that Rose
could scarcely see any undulations in the brown shining back on which
she could have placed her foot nor felt the soft beat of the delicate
hoofs that took the dust so firmly and yet so lightly

The rapidity of motion which kept them both with heads bent forward and
seemed to force back any utterance that rose to their lips spared Rose
the obligation of conversation and her companion was equally reticent
But it was evident to her that he half suspected she was running away
from the Randolphs and that she wished to avoid the embarrassment of
being overtaken even in persuasive pursuit It was not possible that
he knew the cause of her flight and yet she could not account for
his evident desire to befriend her nor above all for his apparently
humorous enjoyment of the situation Had he taken it gravely she might
have been tempted to partly confide in him and ask his advice Was she
doing right after all Ought she not to have stayed long enough to
speak her mind to Mrs Randolph and demand to be sent home No She had
not only shrunk from repeating the infamous slander she had overheard
but she had a terrible fear that if she had done so Mrs Randolph was
capable of denying it or even charging her of being still under the
influence of the earthquake shock and of walking in her sleep No She
could not trust hershe could trust no one there Had not even the
major listened to those infamous lies Had she not seen that he was
helpless in the hands of this cabal in his own householda cabal that
she herself had thoughtlessly joined against him

They had reached the first slight ascent Her companion drew out his
watch looked at it with satisfaction and changed the position of his
hands on the reins Without being able to detect the difference she
felt they were slackening speed She turned inquiringly towards him he
nodded his head with a half smile and a gesture to her to look ahead
The spires of San Jose were already faintly uplifting from the distant
fringe of oaks

So soon In fifteen minutes she would be thereand THEN She remembered
suddenly she had not yet determined what to do Should she go on at once
to San Francisco or telegraph to her father and await him at San Jose
In either case a new fear of the precipitancy of her action and the
inadequacy of her reasons had sprung up in her mind Would her father
understand her Would he underrate the cause and be mortified at the
insult she had given the family of his old friend or more dreadful
still would he exaggerate her wrongs and seek a personal quarrel with
the major He was a man of quick temper and had the Western ideas of
redress Perhaps even now she was precipitating a duel between them Her
cheeks grew wan again her breath came quickly tears gathered in her
eyes Oh she was a dreadful girl she knew it she was an utterly
miserable one and she knew that too

The reins were tightened The pace lessened and at last fell to a walk
Conscious of her telltale eyes and troubled face she dared not turn to
her companion to ask him why but glanced across the fields

When you first came I didnt get to know your name Miss Mallory but I
reckon I know your father

Her father What made him say that She wanted to speak but she
felt she could not In another moment if he went on she must do
SOMETHINGshe would cry

I reckon youll be wanting to go to the hotel first anyway

Thereshe knew it He WOULD keep on And now she had burst into tears

The mare was still walking slowly the man was lazily bending forward
over the shafts as if nothing had occurred Then suddenly illogically
and without a moments warning the pride that had sustained her
crumbled and became as the dust of the road

She burst out and told himthis strangerthis man she had
dislikedall and EVERYTHING How she had felt how she had been
deceived and what she had overheard

I thought as much said her companion quietly and thats why I sent
for your father

You sent for my fatherwhenwhere echoed Rose in astonishment

Yesterday He was to come today and if we dont find him at the hotel
it will be because he has already started to come here by the upper and
longer road But you leave it to ME and dont you say anything to him
of this now If hes at the hotel Ill say I drove you down there to
show off the mare Sabe If he isnt Ill leave you there and come back
here to find him Ive got something to tell him that will set YOU all
right He smiled grimly lifted the reins the mare started forward
again and the vehicle and its occupants disappeared in a vanishing dust
cloud


CHAPTER VI


It was nearly noon when Mr Dawson finished rubbing down his sweating
mare in the little stable shed among the wheat He had left Rose at the
hotel for they found Mr Mallory had previously started by a circuitous
route for the wheat ranch He had resumed not only his working clothes
but his working expression He was now superintending the unloading of
a wain of stores and implements when the light carryall of the Randolphs
rolled into the field It contained only Mrs Randolph and the driver
A slight look of intelligence passed between the latter and the nearest
one of Dawsons companions succeeded however by a dull look of stupid
vacancy on the faces of all the others including Dawson Mrs Randolph
noticed it and was forewarned She reflected that no human beings ever
looked NATURALLY as stupid as that and were able to work She smiled
sarcastically and then began with dry distinctness and narrowing lips

Miss Mallory a young lady visiting us went out for an early walk this
morning and has not returned It is possible she may have lost her way
among your wheat Have you seen anything of her

Dawson raised his eyes from his work and glanced slowly around at his
companions as if taking the heavy sense of the assembly One or two
shook their heads mechanically and returned to their suspended labor
He said coolly

Nobody here seems to

She felt that they were lying She was only a woman against five men
She was only a petty domestic tyrant she might have been a larger one
But she had all the courage of that possibility

Major Randolph and my son are away she went on drawing herself
erect But I know that the major will pay liberally if these men will
search the field besides making it all right with yourEMPLOYERSfor
the loss of time

Dawson uttered a single word in a low voice to the man nearest him
who apparently communicated it to the others for the four men stopped
unloading and moved away one after the othereven the driver joining
in the exodus Mrs Randolph smiled sarcastically it was plain that
these people with all their boasted independence were quite amenable
to pecuniary considerations Nevertheless as Dawson remained looking
quietly at her she said

Then I suppose theyve concluded to go and see

No Ive sent them away so that they couldnt HEAR

Hear what

What Ive got to say to you

She looked at him suddenly Then she said with a disdainful
glance around her I see I am helpless here andthanks to your
trickeryalone Have a care sir I warn you that you will have to
answer to Major Randolph for any insolence

I reckon you wont tell Major Randolph what I have to say to you he
returned coolly

Her lips were nearly a grayish hue but she said scornfully And why
not Do you know who you are talking to

The man came lazily forward to the carryall carelessly brushed aside
the slack reins and resting his elbows on the horses back laid his
chin on his hands as he looked up in the womans face

Yes I know who Im talking to he said coolly But as the major
dont I reckon you wont tell him

Stand away from that horse she said her whole face taking the
grayish color of her lips but her black eyes growing smaller and
brighter Hand me those reins and let me pass What canaille are you
to stop me

I thought so returned the man without altering his position you
dont know ME You never saw ME before Well Im Jim Dawson the nephew
of LHommadieu YOUR OLD MASTER

She gripped the iron rail of the seat as if to leap from it but checked
herself suddenly and leaned back with a set smile on her mouth that
seemed stamped there It was remarkable that with that smile she flung
away her old affectation of superciliousness for an older and ruder
audacity and that not only the expression but the type of her face
appeared to have changed

I dont say continued the man quietly that he didnt MARRY you
before he died But you know as well as I do that the laws of his State
didnt recognize the marriage of a master with his octoroon slave And
you know as well as I do that even if he had freed you he couldnt
change your blood Why if Id been willing to stay at Avoyelles to be a
niggerdriver like him the plantation of de Fontangeswhose name
you have takenwould have been left to me If YOU had stayed there
you might have been my property instead of YOUR owning a square man like
Randolph You didnt think of that when you came here did you he said
composedly

Oh mon Dieu she said dropping rapidly into a different accent
with her white teeth and fixed mirthless smile so it is a claim for
PROPERTY eh Youre wanting moneyyou Tres bien you forget we are
in California where one does not own a slave And you have a fine story
there my poor friend Very pretty but very hard to prove msieu And
these peasants are in it eh working it on shares like the farm eh

Well said Dawson slightly changing his position and passing his
hand over the horses neck with a halfwearied contempt one of these
men is from Plaquemine and the other from Coupee They know all the
lHommadieus history And they know a streak of the tar brush when they
see it They took your measure when they came here last year and sized
you up fairly So had I for the matter of that when I FIRST saw you
And we compared notes But the major is a square man for all he is your
husband and we reckoned he had a big enough contract on his hands to
take care of you and lHommadieus halfbreeds and sohe tossed the
reins contemptuously asidewe kept this to ourselves

And now you wantwhateh

We want an end to this foolery he broke out roughly stepping back
from the vehicle and facing her suddenly with his first angry gesture
We want an end to these airs and grimaces and all this dandy nigger
business we want an end to this cakewalking through the wheat and
flouting of the honest labor of your betters We want you and your de
Fontanges to climb down And we want an end to this ropingin of white
folks to suit your little game we want an end to your trying to mix
your nigger blood with any one here and we intend to stop it We draw
the line at the major

Lashed as she had been by those words apparently out of all semblance of
her former social arrogance a lower and more stubborn resistance seemed
to have sprung up in her as she sat sideways watching him with her set
smile and contracting eyes

Ah she said dryly so SHE IS HERE I thought so Which of you is it
eh Its a good specMallorys a rich man Shes not particular

The man had stopped as if listening his head turned towards the road
Then he turned carelessly and facing her again waved his hand with a
gesture of tired dismissal and said Go Youll find your driver over
there by the toolshed He has heard nothing yetbut Ive given you
fair warning Go

He walked slowly back towards the shed as the woman snatching up
the reins drove violently off in the direction where the men had
disappeared But she turned aside ignoring her waiting driver in her
wild and reckless abandonment of all her old conventional attitudes and
lashing her horse forward with the same set smile on her face the same
odd relaxation of figure and the same squaring of her elbows

Avoiding the main road she pushed into a narrow track that intersected
another nearer the scene of the accident to Roses buggy three weeks
before She had nearly passed it when she was hailed by a strange voice
and looking up perceived a horseman floundering in the mazes of the
wheat to one side of the track Whatever mean thought of her past life
she was flying from whatever mean purpose she was flying to she pulled
up suddenly and as suddenly resumed her erect aggressive stiffness
The stranger was a middleaged man in dress and appearance a dweller of
cities He lifted his hat as he perceived the occupant of the wagon to
be a lady

I beg your pardon but I fear Ive lost my way in trying to make a
short cut to the Excelsior Companys Ranch

You are in it now said Mrs Randolph quickly

Thank you but where can I find the farmhouse

There is none she returned with her old superciliousness unless
you choose to give that name to the shanties and sheds where the
laborers and servants live near the road

The stranger looked puzzled Im looking for a Mr Dawson he said
reflectively but I may have made some mistake Do you know Major
Randolphs house hereabouts

I do I am Mrs Randolph she said stiffly

The strangers brow cleared and he smiled pleasantly Then this is a
fortunate meeting he said raising his hat again as he reined in his
horse beside the wagon for I am Mr Mallory and I was looking forward
to the pleasure of presenting myself to you an hour or two later The
fact is an old acquaintance Mr Dawson telegraphed me yesterday to
meet him here on urgent business and I felt obliged to go there first

Mrs Randolphs eyes sparkled with a sudden gratified intelligence but
her manner seemed rather to increase than abate its grim precision

Our meeting this morning Mr Mallory is both fortunate and
unfortunate for I regret to say that your daughter who has not been
quite herself since the earthquake was missing early this morning and
has not yet been found though we have searched everywhere Understand
me she said as the stranger started I have no fear for her PERSONAL
safety I am only concerned for any INDISCRETION that she may commit in
the presence of these strangers whose company she would seem to prefer
to ours

But I dont understand you madam said Mallory sternly you are
speaking of my daughter and

Excuse me Mr Mallory said Mrs Randolph lifting her hand with
her driest deprecation and her most desiccating smile Im not passing
judgment or criticism I am of a foreign race and consequently do not
understand the freedom of American young ladies and their familiarity
with the opposite sex I make no charges I only wish to assure you that
she will no doubt be found in the company and under the protection of
her own countrymen There is she added with ironical distinctness a
young mechanic or field hand or quack welldoctor whom she seems to
admire and with whom she appears to be on equal terms

Mallory regarded her for a moment fixedly and then his sternness
relaxed to a mischievously complacent smile That must be young Bent
of whom Ive heard he said with unabated cheerfulness And I dont
know but what she may be with him after all For now I think of it a
chuckleheaded fellow of whom a moment ago I inquired the way to your
house told me Id better ask the young man and young woman who were
philandering through the wheat yonder Suppose we look for them From
what Ive heard of Bent hes too much wrapped up in his inventions for
flirtation but it would be a good joke to stumble upon them

Mrs Randolphs eyes sparkled with a mingling of gratified malice and
undisguised contempt for the fatuous father beside her But before she
could accept or decline the challenge it had become useless A murmur
of youthful voices struck her ear and she suddenly stood upright and
transfixed in the carriage For lounging down slowly towards them out
of the dim green aisles of the arbored wheat lost in themselves and the
shimmering veil of their seclusion came the engineer Thomas Bent and
on his arm gazing ingenuously into his face the figure of Adeleher
own perfect daughter


I dont think my dear said Mr Mallory as the anxious Rose flew
into his arms on his return to San Jose a few hours later that it
will be necessary for you to go back again to Major Randolphs before we
leave I have said Goodby for you and thanked them and your trunks
are packed and will be sent here The fact is my dear you see this
affair of the earthquake and the disaster to the artesian well have
upset all their arrangements and I am afraid that my little girl would
be only in their way just now

And you have seen Mr Dawsonand you know why he sent for you asked
the young girl with nervous eagerness

Ah yes said Mr Mallory thoughtfully THAT was really important
You see my child he continued taking her hand in one of his own and
patting the back of it gently with the other we think Dawson and I
of taking over the majors ranch and incorporating it with the Excelsior
in one to be worked on shares like the Excelsior and as Mrs Randolph
is very anxious to return to the Atlantic States with her children it
is quite possible Mrs Randolph as you have possibly noticed Mr
Mallory went on still patting his daughters hand does not feel
entirely at home here and will consequently leave the major free to
rearrange by himself the ranch on the new basis In fact as the
change must be made before the crops come in she talks of going next
week But if you like the place Rose Ive no doubt the major and
Dawson will always find room for you and me when we run down there for a
little fresh air

And did you have all that in your mind papa when you came down here
and was that what you and Mr Dawson wanted to talk about said the
astonished Rose

Mainly my dear mainly You see Im a capitalist now and the
real value of capital is to know how and when to apply it to certain
conditions

And this MrMr Bentdo you thinkhe will go on and find the water
papa said Rose hesitatingly

Ah BentTom Bentoh yes said Mallory with great heartiness
Capital fellow Bent and mighty ingenious Glad you met him Well
thoughtfully but still heartily he may not find it exactly where he
expected but hell find it or something better We cant part with him
and he has promised Dawson to stay Well utilize HIM you may be sure

It would seem that they did and from certain interviews and
conversations that took place between Mr Bent and Miss Mallory on
a later visit it would also appear that her father had exercised
a discreet reticence in regard to a certain experiment of the young
inventor of which he had been an accidental witness




A MAECENAS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE


CHAPTER I


As Mr Robert Rushbrook known to an imaginative press as the Maecenas
of the Pacific Slope drove up to his country seat equally referred
to as a palatial villa he cast a quick but practical look at the
pillared pretensions of that enormous shell of wood and paint and
plaster The statement also a reportorial one that its site the
Canyon of Los Osos some three years ago was disturbed only by the
passing tread of bear and wildcat had lost some of its freshness as a
picturesque apology and already successive improvements on the original
building seemingly cast the older part of the structure back to a hoary
antiquity To many it stood as a symbol of everything Robert Rushbrook
did or had donean improvement of all previous performances it was
like his own lifean exciting though irritating state of transition to
something better Yet the visible architectural result as here shown
was scarcely harmonious indeed some of his friendsand Maecenas had
manyprofessed to classify the various improvements by the successive
fortunate ventures in their owners financial career which had led
to new additions under the names of The Comstock Lode Period The
Union Pacific Renaissance The Great Wheat Corner and Water Front
Gable Style a humorous trifling that did not however prevent a few
who were artists from accepting Maecenass liberal compensation for
their services in giving shape to those ideas

Relinquishing to a groom his fasttrotting team the second relay in his
two hours drive from San Francisco he leaped to the ground to meet the
architect already awaiting his orders in the courtyard With his eyes
still fixed upon the irregular building before him he mingled his
greeting and his directions

Look here Barker well have a wing thrown out here and a
hundredfoot ballroom Something to hold a crowd something that can be
used for musicsabea concert or a show

Have you thought of any style Mr Rushbrook suggested the architect

No said Rushbrook Ive been thinking of the timethirty days and
everything to be in Youll stop to dinner Ill have you sit near Jack
Somers You can talk style to him Say I told you

You wish it completed in thirty days repeated the architect
dubiously

Well I shouldnt mind if it were less You can begin at once Theres
a telegraph in the house Patrick will take any message and you can
send up to San Francisco and fix things before dinner

Before the man could reply Rushbrook was already giving a hurried
interview to the gardener and others on his way to the front porch In
another moment he had entered his own halla wonderful temple of white
and silver plaster formal yet friable like the sugared erection of a
wedding cakewhere his majordomo awaited him

Well whos here asked Rushbrook still advancing towards his
apartments

Dinner is set for thirty sir said the functionary keeping step
demurely with his master but Mr Appleby takes ten over to San
Mateo and some may sleep there The charabanc is still out and five
saddlehorses to a picnic in Green Canyon and I cant positively say
but I should think you might count on seeing about fortyfive guests
before you go to town tomorrow The opera troupe seem to have not
exactly understood the invitation sir

How I gave it myself

The chorus and supernumeraries thought themselves invited too sir and
have come I believe sir At least Signora Pegrelli and Madame Denise
said so and that they would speak to you about it but that meantime I
could put them up anywhere

And you made no distinction of course

No sir I put them in the corresponding rooms opposite sir I dont
think the prima donnas like it

Ah

Yes sir

Whatever was in their minds the two men never changed their steady
practical gravity of manner The majordomos appeared to be a subdued
imitation of his masters worn as he might have worn his masters
clothes had he accepted or Mr Rushbrook permitted such a
degradation By this time they had reached the door of Mr Rushbrooks
room and the man paused I didnt include some guests of Mr Leytons
sir that he brought over here to show around the place but he told me
to tell you he would take them away again or leave them as you liked
Theyre some Eastern strangers stopping with him

All right said Rushbrook quietly as he entered his own apartment
It was decorated as garishly as the hall as staring and vivid in color
but wholesomely new and clean for all its paint veneering and plaster
It was filled with heterogeneous splendorall new and well kept yet
with so much of the attitude of the showroom still lingering about
it that one almost expected to see the various articles of furniture
ticketed with their prices A luxurious bed with satin hangings and
Indian carved posts standing ostentatiously in a corner kept up this
resemblance for in a curtained recess stood a worn camp bedstead
Rushbrooks real couch Spartan in its simplicity

Mr Rushbrook drew his watch from his pocket and deliberately divested
himself of his boots coat waistcoat and cravat Then rolling himself
in a fleecy blanketlike rug with something of the habitual dexterity
of a frontiersman he threw himself on his couch closed his eyes
and went instantly to sleep Lying there he appeared to be a man
comfortably middleaged with thick irongray hair that might have
curled had he encouraged such inclination a skin roughened and darkened
by external hardships and exposure but free from taint of inner vice
or excess and indistinctive features redeemed by a singularly handsome
mouth As the lower part of the face was partly hidden by a dense but
closelycropped beard it is probable that the delicate outlines of his
lips had gained something from their framing

He slept through what seemed to be the unnatural stillness of the large
housea quiet that might have come from the lingering influence of
the still virgin solitude around it as if Nature had forgotten the
intrusion or were stealthily retaking her own and later through the
rattle of returning wheels or the sound of voices which were however
promptly absorbed in that deep and masterful silence which was the
unabdicating genius of the canyon For it was remarkable that even
the various artists musicians orators and poets whom Maecenas had
gathered in his cool business fashion under that roof all seemed to
become by contrast with surrounding Nature as new and artificial as
the house and as powerless to assert themselves against its influence

He was still sleeping when James reentered the room but awoke promptly
at the sound of his voice In a few moments he had rearranged his
scarcely disordered toilette and stepped out refreshed and observant
into the hall The guests were still absent from that part of the
building and he walked leisurely past the carelessly opened doors
of the rooms they had left Everywhere he met the same glaring
ornamentation and color the same garishness of treatment the same
inharmonious extravagance of furniture and everywhere the same troubled
acceptance of it by the inmates or the same sense of temporary and
restricted tenancy Dresses were hung over cheval glasses clothes piled
up on chairs to avoid the use of doubtful and over ornamented wardrobes
and in some cases more practical guests had apparently encamped in a
corner of their apartment A gentleman from Siskyousole proprietor of
a mill patent now being considered by Maecenashad confined himself to
a rockingchair and clotheshorse as being trustworthy and familiar a
bolder spirit from Yrekain treaty for capital to start an independent
journal devoted to Maecenass interestshad got a good deal out of and
indeed all he had INTO a Louis XVI armoire while a young painter from
Sacramento had simply retired into his adjoining bathroom leaving the
glories of his bedroom untarnished Suddenly he paused

He had turned into a smaller passage in order to make a shorter cut
through one of the deserted suites of apartments that should bring him
to that part of the building where he designed to make his projected
improvement when his feet were arrested on the threshold of a
sittingroom Although it contained the same decoration and furniture
as the other rooms it looked totally different It was tasteful
luxurious comfortable and habitable The furniture seemed to have
fallen into harmonious position even the staring decorations of the
walls and ceiling were toned down by sprays of laurel and redstained
manzanito boughs with their berries apparently fresh plucked from the
near canyon But he was more unexpectedly impressed to see that the room
was at that moment occupied by a tall handsome girl who had paused
to take breath with her hand still on the heavy centretable she was
moving Standing there graceful glowing and animated she looked the
living genius of the recreated apartment


CHAPTER II


Mr Rushbrook glanced rapidly at his unknown guest Excuse me he
said with respectful business brevity but I thought every one was
out and he stepped backward quickly

Ive only just come she said without embarrassment and would you
mind as you ARE here giving me a lift with this table

Certainly replied Rushbrook and under the young girls direction the
millionaire moved the table to one side

During the operation he was trying to determine which of his
unrecognized guests the fair occupant was Possibly one of the Leyton
party that James had spoken of as impending

Then you have changed all the furniture and put up these things he
asked pointing to the laurel

Yes the room was really something TOO awful It looks better now
dont you think

A hundred per cent said Rushbrook promptly Look here Ill tell
you what youve done Youve set the furniture TO WORK It was simply
lying stillwith no return to anybody on the investment

The young girl opened her gray eyes at this and then smiled The
intruder seemed to be characteristic of California As for Rushbrook he
regretted that he did not know her better he would at once have asked
her to rearrange all the rooms and have managed in some way liberally
to reward her for it A girl like that had no nonsense about her

Yes she said I wonder Mr Rushbrook dont look at it in that way
It is a shame that all these pretty thingsand you know they are really
good and valuableshouldnt show what they are But I suppose everybody
here accepts the fact that this man simply buys them because they are
valuable and nobody interferes and is content to humor him laugh at
him and feel superior It dont strike me as quite fair does it you

Rushbrook was pleased Without the vanity that would be either annoyed
at this revelation of his reputation or gratified at her defense of it
he was simply glad to discover that she had not recognized him as her
host and could continue the conversation unreservedly Have you
seen the ladies boudoir he asked You know the room fitted with
knickknacks and pretty thingssome of em bought from old collections
in Europe by fellows who knew what they were but perhaps he added
looking into her eyes for the first time didnt know exactly what
ladies cared for

I merely glanced in there when I first came for there was such a queer
lot of womenIm told he isnt very particular in that waythat I
didnt stay

And you didnt think THEY might be just as valuable and good as some of
the furniture if they could have been pulled around and put into shape
or set in a corner eh

The young girl smiled she thought her fellowguest rather amusing none
the less so perhaps for catching up her own ideas but nevertheless
she slightly shrugged her shoulders with that hopeless skepticism which
women reserve for their own sex Some of them looked as if they had
been pulled around as you say and hadnt been improved by it

Theres no one there now said Rushbrook with practical directness
come and take a look at it She complied without hesitation walking
by his side tall easy and selfpossessed apparently accepting
without selfconsciousness his half paternal half comradelike
informality The boudoir was a large room repeating on a bigger scale
the incongruousness and ill fitting splendor of the others When she
had of her own accord recognized and pointed out the more admirable
articles he said gravely looking at his watch Weve just about seven
minutes yet if youd like to pull and haul these things around Ill
help you

The young girl smiled Im quite content with what Ive done in my own
room where I have no ones taste to consult but my own I hardly know
how Mr Rushbrook or his lady friends might like my operating here
Then recognizing with feminine tact the snub that might seem implied in
her refusal she said quickly Tell me something about our hostbut
first look isnt that pretty

She had stopped before the window that looked upon the dim blue abyss of
the canyon and was leaning out to gaze upon it Rushbrook joined her

There isnt much to be changed down THERE is there he said half
interrogatively

No not unless Mr Rushbrook took it into his head to roof it in and
somebody was ready with a contract to do it But what do you know of
him Remember Im quite a stranger here

You came with Charley Leyton

With MRS Leytons party said the young girl with a halfsmiling
emphasis But it seems that we dont know whether Mr Rushbrook wants
us here or not till he comes And the drollest thing about it is that
theyre all so perfectly frank in saying so

Charley and he are old friends and youll do well to trust to their
judgment

This was hardly the kind of response that the handsome and clever
society girl before him had been in the habit of receiving but it
amused her Her fellowguest was decidedly original But he hadnt
told her about Rushbrook and it struck her that his opinion would be
independent at least She reminded him of it

Look here said Rushbrook youll meet a man here tonightor hell
be sure to meet YOUwholl tell you all about Rushbrook Hes a smart
chap knows everybody and talks well His name is Jack Somers he is
a great ladies man He can talk to you about these sort of things
tooindicating the furniture with a half tolerant half contemptuous
gesture that struck her as inconsistent with what seemed to be his
previous interestjust as well as he can talk of people Been in
Europe too

The young girls eye brightened with a quick vivacity at the name but a
moment after became reflective and slightly embarrassed I know himI
met him at Mr Leytons He has already talked of Mr Rushbrook but
she added avoiding any conclusion with a pretty pout Id like
to have the opinion of others Yours now I fancy would be quite
independent

You stick to what Jack Somers has said good or bad and you wont
be far wrong he said assuringly He stopped his quick ear had heard
approaching voices he returned to her and held out his hand As it
seemed to her that in California everybody shook hands with everybody
else on the slightest occasions sometimes to save further conversation
she gave him her own He shook it less forcibly than she had feared
and abruptly left her For a moment she was piqued at this superior and
somewhat brusque way of ignoring her request but reflecting that it
might be the awkwardness of an untrained man she dismissed it from her
mind The voices of her friends in the already resounding passages also
recalled her to the fact that she had been wandering about the house
with a stranger and she rejoined them a little selfconsciously

Well my dear said Mrs Leyton gayly it seems we are to stay
Leyton says Rushbrook wont hear of our going

Does that mean that your husband takes the whole opera troupe over to
your house in exchange

Dont be satirical but congratulate yourself on your opportunity of
seeing an awfully funny gathering I wouldnt have you miss it for the
world Its the most characteristic thing out

Characteristic of what

Of Rushbrook of course Nobody else would conceive of getting together
such a lot of queer people

But dont it strike you that were a part of the lot

Perhaps returned the lively Mrs Leyton No doubt thats the reason
why Jack Somers is coming over and is so anxious that YOU should stay
I cant imagine why else he should rave about Miss Grace Nevil as he
does Come Grace no New York or Philadelphia airs here Consider your
uncles interests with this capitalist to say nothing of ours Because
youre a millionaire and have been accustomed to riches from your birth
dont turn up your nose at our unpampered appetites Besides Jack
Somers is Rushbrooks particular friend and he may think your
criticisms unkind

But IS Mr Somers such a great friend of Mr Rushbrooks asked Grace
Nevil

Why of course Rushbrook consults him about all these things gives
him carte blanche to invite whom he likes and order what he likes and
trusts his taste and judgment implicitly

Then this gathering is Mr Somerss selection

How preposterous you are Grace Of course not Only Somerss IDEA of
what is pleasing to Rushbrook gotten up with a taste and discretion
all his own You know Somers is a gentleman educated at West
Pointtraveled all over Europeyou might have met him there and
Rushbrookwell you have only to see him to know what HE is Dont you
understand

A slight seriousness the same shadow that once before darkened the
girls charming face gave way to a mischievous knitting of her brows as
she said naively No


CHAPTER III


Grace Nevil had quite recovered her equanimity when the indispensable
Mr Somers handsome wellbred and selfrestrained approached her
later in the crowded drawingroom Blended with his subdued personal
admiration was a certain ostentation of respectas of a tribute to
a distinguished guestthat struck her I am to have the pleasure of
taking you in Miss Nevil he said Its my one compensation for the
dreadful responsibility just thrust upon me Our host has been suddenly
called away and I am left to take his place

Miss Nevil was slightly startled Nevertheless she smiled graciously
From what I hear this is no new function of yours that is if there
really IS a Mr Rushbrook I am inclined to think him a myth

You make me wish he were retorted Somers gallantly but as I
couldnt reign at all except in his stead I shall look to you to lend
your rightful grace to my borrowed dignity

The more general announcement to the company was received with a few
perfidious regrets from the more polite but with only amused surprise
by the majority Indeed many considered it characteristicso like
Bob Rushbrook and a few enthusiastic friends looked upon it as a
crowning and intentional stroke of humor It remained however for the
gentleman from Siskyou to give the incident a subtlety that struck Miss
Nevils fancy It reminds me he said in her hearing of ole Kernel
Frisbee of Robertson County one of the purlitest men I ever struck
When he knew a feller was very dry hed jest set the decanter afore
him and managed to be called outer the room on busness Now Bob
Rushbrooks about as white a man as that Hes jest the feller who
knowing you and me might feel kinder restrained about indulging our
appetites afore him kinder drops out easy and leaves us alone
And she was impressed by an instinct that the speaker really felt the
delicacy he spoke of and that it left no sense of inferiority behind

The dinner served in a large brilliantlylit saloon that in floral
decoration and gilded columns suggested an ingenious blending of a
steamboat table dhote and harvest home was perfect in its cuisine
even if somewhat extravagant in its proportions

I should be glad to receive the salary that Rushbrook pays his chef
and still happier to know how to earn it as fairly said Somers to his
fair companion

But is his skill entirely appreciated here she asked

Perfectly responded Somers Our friend from Siskyou over there
appreciates that pate which he cannot name as well as I do Rushbrook
himself is the only exception yet I fancy that even HIS simplicity and
regularity in feeding is as much a matter of business with him as
any defect in his earlier education In his eyes his chefs greatest
qualification is his promptness and fertility Have you noticed that
ornament before you pointing to an elaborate confection It bears
your initials you see It was conceived and executed since you
arrivedrather I should say since it was known that you would honor
us with your company The greatest difficulty encountered was to find
out what your initials were

And I suppose mischievously added the young girl to her
acknowledgments that the same fertile mind which conceived the design
eventually provided the initials

That is our secret responded Somers with affected gravity

The wines were of characteristic expensiveness and provoked the same
general comment Rushbrook seldom drank wine Somers had selected
it But the barbaric opulence of the entertainment culminated in the
Californian fruits piled in pyramids on silver dishes gorgeous and
unreal in their size and painted beauty and the two Divas smiled over
a basket of grapes and peaches as outrageous in dimensions and glaring
color as any pasteboard banquet at which they had professionally
assisted As the courses succeeded each other under the exaltation of
wine conversation became more general as regarded participation but
more local and private as regarded the subject until Miss Nevil could
no longer follow it The interests of that one the hopes of another
the claims of a third in affairs that were otherwise uninteresting
were all discussed with singular youthfulness of trust that to her
alone seemed remarkable Not that she lacked entertainment from the
conversation of her clever companion whose confidences and criticisms
were very pleasant to her but she had a gentlewomans instinct that he
talked to her too much and more than was consistent with his duties
as the general host She looked around the table for her singular
acquaintance of an hour before but she had not seen him since She
would have spoken about him to Somers but she had an instinctive
idea that the latter would be antipathetic in spite of the strangers
flattering commendation So she found herself again following Somerss
cynical but goodhumored description of the various guests and I
fear seeing with his eyes listening with his ears and occasionally
participating in his superior attitude The fearful joy she had found
in the novelty of the situation and the originality of the actors seemed
now quite right from this critical point of view So she learned how the
guest with the long hair was an unknown painter to whom Rushbrook had
given a commission for three hundred yards of painted canvas to be cut
up and framed as occasion and space required in Rushbrooks new
hotel in San Francisco how the graybearded foreigner near him was an
accomplished bibliophile who was furnishing Mr Rushbrooks library from
spoils of foreign collections and had suffered unheardof agonies from
the millionaires insisting upon a handsome uniform binding that should
deprive certain precious but musty tomes of their crumbling wormeaten
coverings how the very gentle clericallooking stranger mildest of a
noisy disputing crowd at the other table was a notorious duelist and
dead shot how the only gentleman at the table who retained a flannel
shirt and high boots was not a latecoming mountaineer but a wellknown
English baronet on his travels how the man who told a somewhat florid
and emphatic anecdote was a popular Eastern clergyman how the one
querulous discontented face in a laughing group was the famous humorist
who had just convulsed it and how a pale handsome young fellow who
ate and drank sparingly and disregarded the coquettish advances of the
prettiest Diva with the cold abstraction of a student was a notorious
roue and gambler But there was a sudden and unlookedfor change of
criticism and critic

The festivity had reached that stage when the guests were more or less
accessible to emotion and more or less touched by the astounding fact
that every one was enjoying himself This phenomenon which is apt to
burst into song or dance among other races is constrained to voice
itself in an AngloSaxon gathering by some explanation apology or
moralknown as an afterdinner speech Thus it was that the gentleman
from Siskyou who had been from time to time casting glances at Somers
and his fair companion at the head of the table now rose to his feet
albeit unsteadily pushed back his chair and began

Pears to me ladies and gentlemen and feller pardners that on
an occasion like this suthin oughter be said of the man who got it
upwhose money paid for it and who aint here to speak for himself
except by deputy Yet you all know thats Bob Rushbrooks stylehe
aint here because hes full of some other plan or improvementsand
its like him to start suthin of this kind give it its aim and
purpose and then stand aside to let somebody else run it for him There
aint no man livin ez hez so to speak more fast horses ready saddled
for riding and more fast men ready spurred to ride emwhether to win
his races or run his errands There aint no man livin ez knows better
how to make other mens games his or his game seem to be other mens
And from Jack Somers smilin over there ez knows where to get the best
wine that Bob pays for and knows how to run this yer show for Bob
at Bobs expensewere all contented Ladies and gentlemen were all
contented We stand so to speak on the cards hes dealt us What may
be his little game it aint for us to say but whatever it is WERE IN
IT Gentlemen and ladies well drink Bobs health

There was a somewhat sensational pause followed by goodnatured
laughter and applause in which Somers joined yet not without a certain
constraint that did not escape the quick sympathy of the shocked and
unsmiling Miss Nevil It was with a feeling of relief that she caught
the chaperoning eye of Mrs Leyton who was entreating her in the usual
mysterious signal to the other ladies to rise and follow her When she
reached the drawingroom a little behind the others she was somewhat
surprised to observe that the stranger whom she had missed during the
evening was approaching her with Mrs Leyton

Mr Rushbrook returned sooner than he expected but unfortunately
as he always retires early he has only time to say goodnight to you
before he goes

For an instant Grace Nevil was more angry than disconcerted Then came
the conviction that she was stupid not to have suspected the truth
before Who else would that brusque stranger develop into but this rude
host She bowed formally

Mr Rushbrook looked at her with the faintest smile on his handsome
mouth Well Miss Nevil I hope Jack Somers satisfied your curiosity

With a sudden recollection of the Siskyou gentlemans speech and a
swift suspicion that in some way she had been made use of with the
others by this forcefullooking man before her she answered pertly

Yes but there was a speech by a gentleman from Siskyou that struck me
as being nearer to the purpose

Thats soI heard it as I came in said Mr Rushbrook calmly I
dont know but youre right


CHAPTER IV


Six months had passed The Villa of Maecenas was closed at Los Osos
Canyon and the southwest tradewinds were slanting the rains of the wet
season against its shut windows and barred doors Within that hollow
deserted shell its aspectsave for a single exceptionwas unchanged
the furniture and decorations preserved their eternal youth undimmed
by time the rigidlyarranged rooms now closed to life and light
developed more than ever their resemblance to a furniture warehouse
The single exception was the room which Grace Nevil had rearranged for
herself and that oddly enough was stripped and bareeven to its
paper and mouldings

In other respects the sealed treasures of Rushbrooks villa far from
provoking any sentimentality seemed only to give truth to the current
rumor that it was merely waiting to be transformed into a gorgeous
wateringplace hotel under Rushbrooks direction that with its new
ballroom changed into an elaborate dininghall it would undergo still
further improvement the inevitable end and object of all Rushbrooks
enterprise and that its former proprietor had already begun another
villa whose magnificence should eclipse the last There certainly
appeared to be no limit to the millionaires success in all that he
personally undertook or in his fortunate complicity with the enterprise
and invention of others His name was associated with the oldest
and safest schemes as well as the newest and boldestwith an equal
guarantee of security A few it was true looked doubtingly upon this
one man power but could not refute the fact that others had largely
benefited by association with him and that he shared his profits with
a royal hand Some objected on higher grounds to his brutalizing
the influence of wealth by his material and extravagantly practical
processes instead of the gentler suggestions of education and personal
example and were impelled to point out the fact that he and his
patronage were vulgar It was felt however by those who received his
benefits that a proper sense of this inferiority was all that ethics
demanded of them One could still accept Rushbrooks barbaric gifts by
humorously recognizing the fact that he didnt know any better and that
it pleased him as long as they resented any higher pretensions

The rainbeaten windows of Rushbrooks town house however were
cheerfully lit that December evening Mr Rushbrook seldom dined
alone in fact it was popularly alleged that very often the unfinished
business of the day was concluded over his bountiful and perfect board
He was dressing as James entered the room

Mr Leyton is in your study sir he will stay to dinner

All right

I think sir added James with respectful suggestiveness he wants
to talk At least sir he asked me if you would likely come downstairs
before your company arrived

Ah Well tell the others Im dining on BUSINESS and set dinner for
two in the blue room

Yes sir

Meanwhile Mr Leytona man of Rushbrooks age but not so fresh and
vigorouslookinghad thrown himself in a chair beside the study fire
after a glance around the handsome and familiar room For the house had
belonged to a brother millionaire it had changed hands with certain
shares of Water Frontas some of Rushbrooks dealings had the true
barbaric absence of money detailand was elegantly and tastefully
furnished The cuckoo had however already laid a few characteristic
eggs in this adopted nest and a white marble statue of a nude and
illfed Virtue sent over by Rushbrooks Paris agent and unpacked
that morning stood in one corner and materially brought down the
temperature A Japanese prayingthrone of pure ivory and above it a
few yards of improper colored exposure by an old master equalized each
other

And what is all this affair about the dinner suddenly asked a
tartlypitched female voice with a foreign accent

Mr Leyton turned quickly and was just conscious of a faint shriek the
rustle of a skirt and the swift vanishing of a womans figure from the
doorway Mr Leyton turned red Rushbrook lived en garcon with feminine
possibilities Leyton was a married man and a deacon The incident
which to a man of the world would have brought only a smile fired the
inexperienced Leyton with those exaggerated ideas and intense credulity
regarding vice common to some very good men He walked on tiptoe to the
door and peered into the passage At that moment Rushbrook entered from
the opposite door of the room

Well said Rushbrook with his usual practical directness what do
you think of her

Leyton still flushed and with eyebrows slightly knit said awkwardly
that he had scarcely seen her

She cost me already ten thousand dollars and I suppose Ill have
to eventually fix up a separate room for her somewhere continued
Rushhrook

I should certainly advise it said Leyton quickly for really
Rushbrook you know that something is due to the respectable people who
come here and any of them are likely to see

Ah interrupted Rushbrook seriously you think she hasnt got on
clothes enough Why look here old manshes one of the Virtues and
thats the rig in which they always travel Shes a Temperance or a
Charity or a Resignation or something of that kind Youll find her
name there in French somewhere at the foot of the marble

Leyton saw his mistake but feltas others sometimes felta doubt
whether this smileless man was not inwardly laughing at him He replied
with a keen rapid glance at his host

I was referring to some woman who stood in that doorway just now and
addressed me rather familiarly thinking it was you

Oh the Signora said Rushbrook with undisturbed directness well
you saw her at Los Osos last summer Likely she DID think you were me

The cool ignoring of any ulterior thought in Leytons objection forced
the guest to be equally practical in his reply

Yes but the fact is that Miss Nevil had talked of coming here with me
this evening to see you on her own affairs and it wouldnt have been
exactly the thing for her to meet that woman

She wouldnt said Rushbrook promptly nor would YOU if you had
gone into the parlor as Miss Nevil would have done But look here If
thats the reason why you didnt bring her send for her at once my
coachman can take a card from you the broughams all ready to fetch
her and there you are Shell see only you and me He was already
moving towards the bell when Leyton stopped him

No matter now I can tell you her business I fancy and in fact I
came here to speak of it quite independently of her

That wont do Leyton interrupted Rushbrook with crisp decision
One or the other interview is unnecessary it wastes time and isnt
business Better have her present even if she dont say a word

Yes but not in this matter responded Leyton its about Somers You
know hes been very attentive to her ever since her uncle left her here
to recruit her health and I think she fancies him Well although shes
independent and her own mistress as you know Mrs Leyton and I are
somewhat responsible for her acquaintance with Somersand for that
matter so are you and as my wife thinks it means a marriage we ought
to know something more positive about Somerss prospects Now all we
really know is that hes a great friend of yours that you trust a good
deal to him that he manages your social affairs that you treat him
as a son or nephew and its generally believed that hes as good as
provided for by youeh Did you speak

No said Rushbrook quietly regarding the statue as if taking its
measurement for a suitable apartment for it Go on

Well said Leyton a little impatiently thats the belief everybody
has and youve not contradicted it And on that weve taken the
responsibility of not interfering with Somerss attentions

Well said Rushbrook interrogatively

Well replied Leyton emphatically you see I must ask you positively
if you HAVE done anything or are you going to do anything for him

Well replied Rushbrook with exasperating coolness what do you call
this marriage

I dont understand you said Leyton

Look here Leyton said Rushbrook suddenly and abruptly facing him
Jack Somers has brains knowledge of society tact accomplishments
and good looks thats HIS capital as much as mine is money I employ
him thats his advertisement recommendation and credit Now on the
strength of this as you say Miss Nevil is willing to invest in him I
dont see what more can be done

But if her uncle dont think it enough

Shes independent and has money for both

But if she thinks shes been deceived and changes her mind

Leyton you dont know Miss Nevil Whatever that girl undertakes shes
weighed fully and goes through with If shes trusted him enough to
marry him money wont stop her if she thinks shes been deceived
YOULL never know it

The enthusiasm and conviction were so unlike Rushbrooks usual cynical
toleration of the sex that Leyton stared at him

Thats odd he returned Thats what she says of you

Of ME you mean Somers

No of YOU Come Rushbrook dont pretend you dont know that
Miss Nevil is a great partisan of yours swears by you says youre
misunderstood by people and whats infernally odd in a woman who dont
belong to the class you fancy dont talk of your habits Thats why she
wants to consult you about Somers I suppose and thats why knowing
you might influence her I came here first to warn you

And Ive told you that whatever I might say or do wouldnt influence
her So well drop the subject

Not yet for youre bound to see Miss Nevil sooner or later Now if
she knows that youve done nothing for this man your friend and her
lover wont she be justified in thinking that you would have a reason
for it

Yes I should give it

What reason

That I knew shed be more contented to have him speculate with HER
money than mine

Then you think that he isnt a business man

I think that she thinks so or she wouldnt marry him its part of the
attraction But come James has been for five minutes discreetly waiting
outside the door to tell us dinner is ready and the coast clear of all
other company But look here he said suddenly stopping with his arm
in Leytons youre through your talk I suppose perhaps youd rather
wed dine with the Signora and the others than alone

For an instant Leyton thrilled with the fascination of what he firmly
believed was a guilty temptation Rushbrook perceiving his hesitation
added

By the way Somers is of the party and one or two others you know

Mr Leyton opened his eyes widely at this either the temptation had
passed or the idea of being seen in doubtful company by a younger man
was distasteful for he hurriedly disclaimed any preference But he
added with halfsignificant politeness perhaps Im keeping YOU from
them

It makes not the slightest difference to me calmly returned
Rushbrook with such evident truthfulness that Leyton was both convinced
and chagrined

Preceded by the grave and ubiquitous James they crossed the large hall
and entered through a smaller passage a charming apartment hung
with blue damask which might have been a boudoir study or small
receptionroom yet had the air of never having been anything
continuously It would seem that Rushbrooks habit of camping out in
different parts of his mansion obtained here as at Los Osos and with
the exception of a small closet which contained his Spartan bed the
rooms were used separately or in suites as occasion or his friends
required It is recorded that an Eastern guest newly arrived with
letters to Rushbrook after a tedious journey expressed himself pleased
with this same blue room in which he had sumptuously dined with his
host and subsequently fell asleep in his chair Without disturbing his
guest Rushbrook had the table removed a bed washstand and bureau
brought in the sleeping man delicately laid upon the former and left
to awaken to an Arabian nights realization of his wish


CHAPTER V


James had barely disposed of his master and Mr Leyton and left them
to the ministrations of two of his underlings before he was confronted
with one of those difficult problems that it was part of his functions
to solve The porter informed him that a young lady had just driven up
in a carriage ostensibly to see Mr Rushbrook and James descending to
the outer vestibule found himself face to face with Miss Grace
Nevil Happily that young lady with her usual tact spared him some
embarrassment

Oh James she said sweetly do you think that I could see Mr
Rushbrook for a few moments IF I WAITED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY You
understand I dont wish to disturb him or his company by being
regularly announced

The young girls practical intelligence appeared to increase the usual
respect which James had always shown her I understand miss He
thought for a moment and said Would you mind then following me
where you could wait quietly and alone As she quickly assented he
preceded her up the staircase past the study and drawingroom which
he did not enter and stopped before a small door at the end of the
passage Then handing her a key which he took from his pocket he said
This is the only room in the house that is strictly reserved for Mr
Rushbrook and even he rarely uses it You can wait here without anybody
knowing it until I can communicate with him and bring you to his study
unobserved And he hesitated if you wouldnt mind locking the door
when you are in miss you would be more secure and I will knock when I
come for you

Grace Nevil smiled at the mans prudence and entered the room But
to her great surprise she had scarcely shut the door when she was
instantly struck with a singular memory which the apartment recalled
It was exactly like the room she had altered in Rushbrooks villa at Los
Osos More than that on close examination it proved to be the very same
furniture arranged as she remembered to have arranged it even to the
flowers and grasses now alas faded and withered on the walls There
could be no mistake There was the open ebony escritoire with the
satin blotter open and its leaves still bearing the marks of her own
handwriting So complete to her mind was the idea of her own tenancy in
this bachelors mansion that she looked around with a half indignant
alarm for the photograph or portrait of herself that might further
indicate it But there was no other exposition The only thing that had
been added was a gilt legend on the satin case of the blotterLos
Osos August 20 186 the day she had occupied the room

She was pleased astonished but more than all disturbed The only man
who might claim a right to this figurative possession of her tastes
and habits was the one whom she had quietly reflectively and
understandingly half accepted as her lover and on whose account she had
come to consult Rushbrook But Somers was not a sentimentalist in
fact as a young girl forced by her independent position to somewhat
critically scrutinize masculine weaknesses this had always been a point
in his favor yet even if he had joined with his friend Rushbrook to
perpetuate the memory of their first acquaintanceship his taste merely
would not have selected a chambre de garcon in Mr Rushbrooks home for
its exhibition Her conception of the opposite characters of the two men
was singularly distinct and real and this momentary confusion of them
was disagreeable to her womans sense But at this moment James came to
release her and conduct her to Rushbrooks study where he would join
her at once Everything had been arranged as she had wished

Even a more practical man than Rushbrook might have lingered over the
picture of the tall graceful figure of Miss Nevil quietly enthroned in
a large armchair by the fire her scarlet satinlined cloak thrown over
its back and her chin resting on her hand But the millionaire
walked directly towards her with his usual frankness of conscious but
restrained power and she felt as she always did perfectly at her
ease in his presence Even as she took his outstretched hand its
straightforward grasp seemed to endow her with its own confidence

Youll excuse my coming here so abruptly she smiled but I wanted
to get before Mr Leyton who I believe wishes to see you on the same
business as myself

He is here already and dining with me said Rushbrook

Ah does he know I am here asked the girl quietly

No as he said you had thought of coming with him and didnt I
presumed you didnt care to have him know you had come alone

Not exactly that Mr Rushbrook she said fixing her beautiful eyes
on him in bright and trustful confidence but I happen to have a fuller
knowledge of this business than he has and yet as it is not altogether
my own secret I was not permitted to divulge it to him Nor would I
tell it to you only I cannot bear that you should think that I
had anything to do with this wretched inquisition into Mr Somerss
prospects Knowing as well as you do how perfectly independent I am you
would think it strange wouldnt you But you would think it still
more surprising when you found out that I and my uncle already know how
liberally and generously you had provided for Mr Somers in the future

How I had provided for Mr Somers in the future repeated Mr
Rushbrook looking at the fire eh

Yes said the young girl indifferently how you were to put him in
to succeed you in the Water Front Trust and all that He told it to
me and my uncle at the outset of our acquaintance confidentially of
course and I dare say with an honorable delicacy that was like him
butI suppose now you will think me foolishall the while Id rather
he had not

Youd rather he had not repeated Mr Rushbrook slowly

Yes continued Grace leaning forward with her rounded elbows on her
knees and her slim arched feet on the fender Now you are going
to laugh at me Mr Rushbrook but all this seemed to me to spoil any
spontaneous feeling I might have towards him and limit my independence
in a thing that should be a matter of free will alone It seemed too
much like a business proposition There my kind friend she added
looking up and trying to read his face with a half girlish pout
followed however by a maturer sigh Im bothering you with a womans
foolishness instead of talking business Andanother sighI suppose
it IS business for my uncle who has it seems bought into this Trust
on these possible contingencies has perhaps been asking questions
of Mr Leyton But I dont want you to think that I approve of them or
advise your answering them But you are not listening

I had forgotten something said Rushbrook with an odd preoccupation
Excuse me a momentI will return at once

He left the room quite as abstractedly and when he reached the passage
he apparently could not remember what he had forgotten as he walked
deliberately to the end window where with his arms folded behind his
back he remained looking out into the street A passerby glancing
up might have said he had seen the pale stern ghost of Mr Rushbrook
framed like a stony portrait in the window But he presently turned
away and reentered the room going up to Grace who was still sitting
by the fire in his usual strong and direct fashion

Well Now let me see what you want I think this would do

He took a seat at his open desk and rapidly wrote a few lines

There he continued when you write to your uncle inclose that

Grace took it and read


DEAR MISS NEVILPray assure your uncle from me that I am quite
ready to guarantee in any form that he may require the undertaking
represented to him by Mr John Somers Yours very truly

ROBERT RUSHBROOK


A quick flush mounted to the young girls cheeks But this is a
SECURITY Mr Rushbrook she said proudly handing him back the paper
and my uncle does not require that Nor shall I insult him or you by
sending it

It is BUSINESS Miss Nevil said Rushbrook gravely He stopped and
fixed his eyes upon her animated face and sparkling eyes You can send
it to him or not as you like Buta rare smile came to his handsome
mouthas this is a letter to YOU you must not insult ME by not
accepting it

Replying to his smile rather than the words that accompanied it Miss
Nevil smiled too Nevertheless she was uneasy and disturbed The
interview whatever she might have vaguely expected from it had
resolved itself simply into a business indorsement of her lover which
she had not sought and which gave her no satisfaction Yet there was
the same potent and indefinably protecting presence before her which she
had sought but whose omniscience and whose help she seemed to have lost
the spell and courage to put to the test He relieved her in his abrupt
but not unkindly fashion Well when is it to be

It

Your marriage

Oh not for some time Theres no hurry

It might have struck the practical Mr Rushbrook that even considered
as a desirable business affair the prospective completion of
this contract provoked neither frank satisfaction nor conventional
dissimulation on the part of the young lady for he regarded her calm
but slightly wearied expression fixedly But he only said Then I shall
say nothing of this interview to Mr Leyton

As you please It really matters little Indeed I suppose I was rather
foolish in coming at all and wasting your valuable time for nothing

She had risen as if taking his last question in the significance of a
parting suggestion and was straightening her tall figure preparatory
to putting on her cloak As she reached it he stepped forward and
lifted it from the chair to assist her The act was so unprecedented as
Mr Rushbrook never indulged in those minor masculine courtesies that
she was momentarily as confused as a younger girl at the gallantry of a
younger man In their previous friendship he had seldom drawn near her
except to shake her handa circumstance that had always recurred to her
when his free and familiar life had been the subject of gossip But she
now had a more frightened consciousness that her nerves were strangely
responding to his powerful propinquity and she involuntarily contracted
her pretty shoulders as he gently laid the cloak upon them Yet even
when the act was completed she had a superstitious instinct that the
significance of this rare courtesy was that it was final and that
he had helped her to interpose something that shut him out from her
forever

She was turning away with a heightened color when the sound of light
hurried footsteps and the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the
hall A swift recollection of her companions infelicitous reputation
now returned to her and Grace Nevil with a slight stiffening of her
whole frame became coldly herself again Mr Rushbrook betrayed neither
surprise nor agitation Begging her to wait a moment until he could
arrange for her to pass to her carriage unnoticed he left the room

Yet it seemed that the cause of the disturbance was unsuspected by Mr
Rushbrook Mr Leyton although left to the consolation of cigars and
liquors in the blue room had become slightly weary of his companions
prolonged absence Satisfied in his mind that Rushbrook had joined
the gayer party and that he was even now paying gallant court to the
Signora he became again curious and uneasy At last the unmistakable
sound of whispering voices in the passage got the better of his sense of
courtesy as a guest and he rose from his seat and slightly opened the
door As he did so the figures of a man and woman conversing in earnest
whispers passed the opening The mans arm was round the womans
waist the woman wasas he had suspectedthe one who had stood in the
doorway the Signorabutthe man was NOT Rushbrook Mr Leyton drew
back this time in unaffected horror It was none other than Jack Somers

Some warning instinct must at that moment have struck the woman for
with a stifled cry she disengaged herself from Somerss arm and dashed
rapidly down the hall Somers evidently unaware of the cause stood
irresolute for a moment and then more silently but swiftly disappeared
into a side corridor as if to intercept her It was the rapid passage of
the Signora that had attracted the attention of Grace and Rushbrook in
the study and it was the moment after it that Mr Rushbrook left


CHAPTER VI


Vaguely uneasy and still perplexed with her previous agitation as Mr
Rushbrook closed the door behind him Grace following some feminine
instinct rather than any definite reason walked to the door and placed
her hand upon the lock to prevent any intrusion until he returned
Her caution seemed to be justified a moment later for a heavier but
stealthier footstep halted outside The handle of the door was turned
but she resisted it with the fullest strength of her small hand until a
voice which startled her called in a hurried whisper

Open quick tis I

She stepped back quickly flung the door open and beheld Somers on the
threshold

The astonishment agitation and above all the awkward confusion of
this usually selfpossessed and ready man was so unlike him and withal
so painful that Grace hurried to put an end to it and for an instant
forgot her own surprise at seeing him She smiled assuringly and
extended her hand

GraceMiss NevilI beg your pardonI didnt imaginehe began with
a forced laugh I mean of courseI cannotbutHe stopped and then
assuming a peculiar expression said But what are YOU doing here

At any other moment the girl would have resented the tone which was
as new to her as his previous agitation but in her present
selfconsciousness her situation seemed to require some explanation
I came here she said to see Mr Rushbrook on business Your
businessOUR business she added with a charming smile using for the
first time the pronoun that seemed to indicate their unity and interest
and yet fully aware of a vague insincerity in doing so

Our BUSINESS he repeated ignoring her gentler meaning with a changed
emphasis and a look of suspicion

Yes said Grace a little impatiently Mr Leyton thought he ought
to write to my uncle something positive as to your prospects with Mr
Rushbrook and

You came here to inquire said the young man sharply

I came here to stop any inquiry said Grace indignantly I came
here to say I was satisfied with what you had confided to me of Mr
Rushbrooks generosity and that was enough

With what I had confided to you You dared say that

Grace stopped and instantly faced him But any indignation she might
have felt at his speech and manner was swallowed up in the revulsion and
horror that overtook her with the sudden revelation she saw in his
white and frightened face Leytons strange inquiry Rushbrooks cold
composure and scornful acceptance of her own credulousness came to her
in a flash of shameful intelligence Somers had lied The insufferable
meanness of it A lie whose very uselessness and ignobility had
defeated its purposea lie that implied the basest suspicion of her
own independence and truthfulnesssuch a lie now stood out as plainly
before her as his guilty face

Forgive my speaking so rudely he said with a forced smile and attempt
to recover his selfcontrol but you have ruined me unless you deny
that I told you anything It was a jokean extravagance that I had
forgotten at least it was a confidence between you and me that you
have foolishly violated Say that you misunderstood methat it was a
fancy of your own Say anythinghe trusts youhell believe anything
you say

He HAS believed me said Grace almost fiercely turning upon him with
the paper that Rushbrook had given her in her outstretched hand Read
that

He read it Had he blushed had he stammered had he even kept up his
former frantic and pitiable attitude she might at that supreme moment
have forgiven him But to her astonishment his face changed his
handsome brow cleared his careless happy smile returned his graceful
confidence came backhe stood before her the elegant courtly and
accomplished gentleman she had known He returned her the paper and
advancing with extended hand said triumphantly

Superb Splendid No one but a woman could think of that And only one
woman achieve it You have tricked the great Rushbrook You are indeed
worthy of being a financiers wife

No she said passionately tearing up the paper and throwing it at his
feet not as YOU understand itand never YOURS You have debased and
polluted everything connected with it as you would have debased and
polluted ME Out of my presence that you are insultingout of the room
of the man whose magnanimity you cannot understand

The destruction of the guarantee apparently stung him more than the
words that accompanied it He did not relapse again into his former
shamefaced terror but as a malignant glitter came into his eyes he
regained his coolness

It may not be so difficult for others to understand Miss Nevil he
said with polished insolence and as Bob Rushbrooks generosity to
pretty women is already a matter of suspicion perhaps you are wise to
destroy that record of it

Coward said Grace stand aside and let me pass She swept by him
to the door But it opened upon Rushbrooks reentrance He stood for
an instant glancing at the pair and then on the fragments of the paper
that strewed the floor Then still holding the door in his hand he
said quietly

One moment before you go Miss Nevil If this is the result of any
misunderstanding as to the presence of another woman here in company
with Mr Somers it is only fair to him to say that that woman is here
as a friend of MINE not of his and I alone am responsible

Grace halted and turned the cold steel of her proud eyes on the two
men As they rested on Rushbrook they quivered slightly I can already
bear witness she said coldly to the generosity of Mr Rushbrook in
a matter which then touched me But there certainly is no necessity
for him to show it now in a matter in which I have not the slightest
concern

As she swept out of the room and was received in the respectable shadow
of the waiting James Rushbrook turned to Somers

And IM afraid it wont dofor Leyton saw you he said curtly Now
then shut that door for you and I Jack Somers have a word to say to
each other

What that word was and how it was said and received is not a part of
this record But it is told that it was the beginning of that mighty
Iliad still remembered of men which shook the financial camps of San
Francisco and divided them into bitter contending parties For when it
became known the next day that Somers had suddenly abandoned Rushbrook
and carried over to a powerful foreign capitalist the secret methods
and even it was believed the LUCK of his late employer it was certain
that there would be war to the knife and that it was no longer a
struggle of rival enterprise but of vindictive men


CHAPTER VII


For a year the battle between the Somers faction and the giant but
solitary Rushbrook raged fiercely with varying success I grieve to say
that the proteges and parasites of Maecenas deserted him in a body nay
they openly alleged that it was the true artistic nature and refinement
of Somers that had always attracted them and that a man like Rushbrook
who bought pictures by the yardequally of the unknown struggling
artist and the famous masterswas no true patron of Art Rushbrook
made no attempt to recover his lost prestige and once when squeezed
into a tight corner and forced to realize on his treasures he put
them up at auction and the people called them daubs their rage
knew no bounds It was then that an unfettered press discovered that
Rushbrook never was a Maecenas at all grimly deprecated his assumption
of that title and even doubted if he were truly a millionaire It was
at this time that a few stood by himnotably the mill inventor from
Siskyou grown plethoric with success but eventually ground between the
upper and nether millstone of the Somers and Rushbrook party Miss Nevil
had returned to the Atlantic States with Mrs Leyton While rumors
had played freely with the relations of Somers and the Signora as the
possible cause of the rupture between him and Rushbrook no mention had
ever been made of the name of Miss Nevil

It was raining heavily one afternoon when Mr Rushbrook drove from his
office to his San Francisco house The fierce struggle in which he was
engaged left him little time for hospitality and for the last two weeks
his house had been comparatively deserted He passed through the
empty rooms changed in little except the absence of some valuable
monstrosities which had gone to replenish his capital When he reached
his bedroom he paused a moment at the open door

James

Yes sir said James appearing out of the shadow

What are you waiting for

I thought you might be wanting something sir

You were waiting there this morning you were in the anteroom of my
study while I was writing You were outside the blue room while I sat
at breakfast You were at my elbow in the drawingroom late last night
Now James continued Mr Rushbrook with his usual grave directness
I dont intend to commit suicide I cant afford it so keep your time
and your rest for yourselfyou want itthats a good fellow

Yes sir

James

Yes sir

Rushbrook extended his hand There was that faint rare smile on his
handsome mouth for which James would at any time have laid down his
life But he only silently grasped his masters hand and the two
men remained looking into each others eyes without a word Then Mr
Rushbrook entered his room lay down and went to sleep and James
vanished in the shadow

At the end of an hour Mr Rushbrook awoke refreshed and even James who
came to call him appeared to have brightened in the interval I have
ordered a fire sir in the reserved room the one fitted up from Los
Osos as your study has had no chance of being cleaned these two weeks
It will be a change for you sir I hope youll excuse my not waking you
to consult you about it

Rushbrook remained so silent that James fancying he had not heard him
was about to repeat himself when his master said quickly Very well
come for me there when dinner is ready and entered the passage leading
to the room James did not follow him and when Mr Rushbrook opening
the door started back with an exclamation no one but the inmate heard
the word that rose to his lips

For there seated before the glow of the blazing fire was Miss Grace
Nevil She had evidently just arrived for her mantle was barely
loosened around her neck and upon the fringe of brown hair between her
bonnet and her broad low forehead a few drops of rain still sparkled
As she lifted her long lashes quickly towards the door it seemed as
if they too had caught a little of that moisture Rushbrook moved
impatiently forward and then stopped Grace rose unhesitatingly to her
feet and met him halfway with frankly outstretched hands First of
all she said with a half nervous laugh dont scold James its all
my fault I forbade him to announce me lest you should drive me away
for I heard that during this excitement you came here for rest and saw
no one Even the intrusion into this room is all my own I confess now
that I saw it the last night I was here I was anxious to know if it was
unchanged and made James bring me here I did not understand it then I
do nowandthank you

Her face must have shown that she was conscious that he was still
holding her hand for he suddenly released it With a heightened color
and a half girlish naivete that was the more charming for its contrast
with her tall figure and air of thoroughbred repose she turned back to
her chair and lightly motioned him to take the one before her I am
here on BUSINESS otherwise I should not have dared to look in upon you
at all

She stopped drew off her gloves with a provoking deliberation which
was none the less fascinating that it implied a demure consciousness of
inducing some impatience in the breast of her companion stretched them
out carefully by the fingers laid them down neatly on the table
placed her elbows on her knees slightly clasped her hands together and
bending forward lifted her honest handsome eyes to the man before her

Mr Rushbrook I have got between four and five hundred thousand
dollars that I have no use for I can control securities which can be
converted if necessary into a hundred thousand more in ten days I am
free and my own mistress It is generally considered that I know what I
am aboutyou admitted as much when I was your pupil I have come here
to place this sum in your hands at your free disposal You know why and
for what purpose

But what do you know of my affairs asked Rushbrook quickly

Everything and I know YOU which is better Call it an investment if
you likefor I know you will succeedand let me share your profits
Call itif you pleaserestitution for I am the miserable cause of
your rupture with that man Or call it revenge if you like she said
with a faint smile and let me fight at your side against our common
enemy Please Mr Rushbrook dont deny me this I have come three
thousand miles for it I could have sent it to youor writtenbut I
feared you would not understand it You are smilingyou will take it

I cannot said Rushbrook gravely

Then you force me to go into the Stock Market myself and fight for
you and unaided by YOUR genius perhaps lose it without benefiting
you

Rushbrook did not reply

At least then tell me why you cannot

Rushbrook rose and looking into her face said quietly with his old
directness

Because I love you Miss Nevil

A sudden instinct to rise and move away a greater one to remain and
hear him speak again and a still greater one to keep back the blood
that she felt was returning all too quickly to her cheek after the first
shock kept her silent But she dropped her eyes

I loved you ever since I first saw you at Los Osos he went on
quickly I said to myself even then that if there was a woman that
would fill my life and make me what she wished me to be it was you I
even fancied that day that you understood me better than any woman or
even any man that I had ever met before I loved you through all that
miserable business with that man even when my failure to make you happy
with another brought me no nearer to you I have loved you always I
shall love you always I love you more for this foolish kindness that
brings YOU beneath my roof once more and gives me a chance to speak my
heart to you if only once and for the last time than all the fortune
that you could put at my disposal But I could not accept what you would
offer me from any woman who was not my wifeand I could not marry
any woman that did not love me I am perhaps past the age when I could
inspire a young girls affection but I have not reached the age when I
would accept anything less He stopped abruptly Grace did not look
up There was a tear glistening upon her long eyelashes albeit a faint
smile played upon her lips

Do you call this business Mr Rushbrook she said softly

Business

To assume a proposal declined before it has been offered

Gracemy darlingtell meis it possible

It was too late for her to rise now as his hands held both hers and
his handsome mouth was smiling level with her own So it really seemed
to a dispassionate spectator that it WAS possible and before she had
left the room it even appeared to be the most probable thing in the
world



The union of Grace Nevil and Robert Rushbrook was recorded by local
history as the crown to his victory over the Ring But only he and his
wife knew that it was the cause
