OPENINGS IN THE OLD TRAIL

by Bret Harte




A MERCURY OF THE FOOTHILLS


It was high hot noon on the Casket Ridge Its very scant shade was
restricted to a few dwarf Scotch firs and was so perpendicularly cast
that Leonidas Boone seeking shelter from the heat was obliged to draw
himself up under one of them as if it were an umbrella Occasionally
with a boys perversity he permitted one bared foot to protrude beyond
the sharply marked shadow until the burning sun forced him to draw it in
again with a thrill of satisfaction There was no earthly reason why
he had not sought the larger shadows of the pinetrees which reared
themselves against the Ridge on the slope below him except that he was
a boy and perhaps even more superstitious and opinionated than most
boys Having got under this tree with infinite care he had made up his
mind that he would not move from it until its line of shade reached and
touched a certain stone on the trail near him WHY he did this he did
not know but he clung to his sublime purpose with the courage and
tenacity of a youthful Casabianca He was cramped tickled by dust and
fir sprays he was supremely uncomfortablebut he stayed A woodpecker
was monotonously tapping in an adjacent pine with measured intervals of
silence which he always firmly believed was a certain telegraphy of
the birds own making a greenandgold lizard flashed by his foot
to stiffen itself suddenly with a rigidity equal to his own Still HE
stirred not The shadow gradually crept nearer the mystic stoneand
touched it He sprang up shook himself and prepared to go about
his business This was simply an errand to the postoffice at the
crossroads scarcely a mile from his fathers house He was already
halfway there He had taken only the better part of one hour for this
desultory journey

However he now proceeded on his way diverging only to follow a fresh
rabbittrack a few hundred yards to note that the animal had doubled
twice against the wind and then naturally he was obliged to look
closely for other tracks to determine its pursuers He paused also
but only for a moment to rap thrice on the trunk of the pine where the
woodpecker was at work which he knew would make it cease work for
a timeas it did Having thus renewed his relations with nature he
discovered that one of the letters he was taking to the postoffice had
slipped in some mysterious way from the bosom of his shirt where he
carried them past his waistband into his trouserleg and was about to
make a casual delivery of itself on the trail This caused him to take
out his letters and count them when he found one missing He had been
given four letters to posthe had only three There was a big one in
his fathers handwriting two indistinctive ones of his mothers and a
smaller one of his sistersTHAT was gone Not at all disconcerted
he calmly retraced his steps following his own tracks minutely with
a grim face and a distinct delight in the process while
lookingperfunctorilyfor the letter In the midst of this slow
progress a bright idea struck him He walked back to the firtree where
he had rested and found the lost missive It had slipped out of his
shirt when he shook himself He was not particularly pleased He knew
that nobody would give him credit for his trouble in going back for
it or his astuteness in guessing where it was He heaved the sigh of
misunderstood genius and again started for the postoffice This time
he carried the letters openly and ostentatiously in his hand

Presently he heard a voice say Hey It was a gentle musical
voicea strangers voice for it evidently did not know how to call
him and did not say Oh Leonidas or Youlook here He was
abreast of a little clearing guarded by a low stockade of bark palings
and beyond it was a small white dwellinghouse Leonidas knew the place
perfectly well It belonged to the superintendent of a mining tunnel
who had lately rented it to some strangers from San Francisco Thus much
he had heard from his family He had a mountain boys contempt for city
folks and was not himself interested in them Yet as he heard the
call he was conscious of a slightly guilty feeling He might have been
trespassing in following the rabbits track he might have been seen by
some one when he lost the letter and had to go back for itall grownup
people had a way of offering themselves as witnesses against him He
scowled a little as he glanced around him Then his eye fell on the
caller on the other side of the stockade

To his surprise it was a woman a pretty gentle fragile creature all
soft muslin and laces with her fingers interlocked and leaning both
elbows on the top of the stockade as she stood under the checkered
shadow of a buckeye

Come herepleasewont you she said pleasantly

It would have been impossible to resist her voice if Leonidas had wanted
to which he didnt He walked confidently up to the fence She really
was very pretty with eyes like his setters and as caressing And
there were little puckers and satiny creases around her delicate
nostrils and mouth when she spoke which Leonidas knew were
expression

IIshe began with charming hesitation then suddenly Whats your
name

Leonidas

Leonidas Thats a pretty name He thought it DID sound pretty Well
Leonidas I want you to be a good boy and do a great favor for mea
very great favor

Leonidass face fell This kind of prelude and formula was familiar to
him It was usually followed by Promise me that you will never swear
again or that you will go straight home and wash your face or some
other irrelevant personality But nobody with that sort of eyes had ever
said it So he said a little shyly but sincerely Yes maam

You are going to the postoffice

This seemed a very foolish womanish question seeing that he was
holding letters in his hand but he said Yes

I want you to put a letter of mine among yours and post them all
together she said putting one little hand to her bosom and drawing
out a letter He noticed that she purposely held the addressed side so
that he could not see it but he also noticed that her hand was
small thin and white even to a faint tint of blue in it unlike
his sisters the babys or any other hand he had ever seen Can you
read she said suddenly withdrawing the letter

The boy flushed slightly at the question Of course I can he said
proudly

Of course certainly she repeated quickly but she added with
a mischievous smile you mustnt NOW Promise me Promise me that you
wont read this address but just post the letter like one of your own
in the letterbox with the others

Leonidas promised readily it seemed to him a great fuss about nothing
perhaps it was some kind of game or a bet He opened his sunburnt hand
holding his own letters and she slipped hers face downward between
them Her soft fingers touched his in the operation and seemed to leave
a pleasant warmth behind them

Promise me another thing she added promise me you wont say a word
of this to any one

Of course said Leonidas

Thats a good boy and I know you will keep your word She hesitated
a moment smilingly and tentatively and then held out a bright
halfdollar Leonidas backed from the fence Id rather not he said
shyly

But as a present from ME

Leonidas coloredhe was really proud and he was also bright enough to
understand that the possession of such unbounded wealth would provoke
dangerous inquiry at home But he didnt like to say it and only
replied I cant

She looked at him curiously Thenthank you she said offering her
white hand which felt like a bird in his Now run on and dont let
me keep you any longer She drew back from the fence as she spoke and
waved him a pretty farewell Leonidas half sorry half relieved darted
away

He ran to the postoffice which he never had done before Loyally he
never looked at her letter nor indeed at his own again swinging
the hand that held them far from his side He entered the postoffice
directly going at once to the letterbox and depositing the precious
missive with the others The postoffice was also the country store
and Leonidas was in the habit of still further protracting his errands
there by lingering in that stimulating atmosphere of sugar cheese and
coffee But today his stay was brief so transitory that the postmaster
himself inferred audibly that old man Boone must have been tanning Lee
with a hickory switch But the simple reason was that Leonidas wished
to go back to the stockade fence and the fair stranger if haply she
was still there His heart sank as breathless with unwonted haste he
reached the clearing and the empty buckeye shade He walked slowly and
with sad diffidence by the deserted stockade fence But presently his
quick eye discerned a glint of white among the laurels near the house
It was SHE walking with apparent indifference away from him towards the
corner of the clearing and the road But this he knew would bring her
to the end of the stockade fence where he must passand it did She
turned to him with a bright smile of affected surprise Why youre as
swiftfooted as Mercury

Leonidas understood her perfectly Mercury was the other name for
quicksilverand that was lively you bet He had often spilt some on
the floor to see it move She must be awfully cute to have noticed it
toocuter than his sisters He was quite breathless with pleasure

I put your letter in the box all right he burst out at last

Without any one seeing it she asked

Sure pop nary one The postmaster stuck out his hand to grab it but I
just let on that I didnt see him and shoved it in myself

Youre as sharp as youre good she said smilingly Now theres just
ONE thing more I want you to do Forget all about thiswont you

Her voice was very caressing Perhaps that was why he said boldly Yes
maam all except YOU

Dear me what a compliment How old are you

Goin on fifteen said Leonidas confidently

And going very fast said the lady mischievously Well then you
neednt forget ME On the contrary she added after looking at him
curiously I would rather youd remember me Goodbyor rather
goodafternoonif Im to be remembered Leon

Goodafternoon maam

She moved away and presently disappeared among the laurels But her
last words were ringing in his ears Leoneverybody else called him
Lee for brevity Leonit was pretty as she said it

He turned away But it so chanced that their parting was not to pass
unnoticed for looking up the hill Leonidas perceived his elder sister
and little brother coming down the road and knew that they must have
seen him from the hilltop It was like their snoopin

They ran to him eagerly

You were talking to the stranger said his sister breathlessly

She spoke to me first said Leonidas on the defensive

What did she say

Wanted to know the eleckshun news said Leonidas with cool mendacity
and I told her

This improbable fiction nevertheless satisfied them What was she like
Oh do tell us Lee continued his sister

Nothing would have delighted him more than to expatiate upon her
loveliness the soft white beauty of her hands the cunning little
puckers around her lips her bright tender eyes the angelic texture
of her robes and the musical tinkle of her voice But Leonidas had no
confidant and what healthy boy ever trusted his sister in such matter
YOU saw what she was like he said with evasive bluntness

But Lee

But Lee was adamant Go and ask her he said

Like as not you were sassy to her and she shut you up said his
sister artfully But even this cruel suggestion which he could have so
easily flouted did not draw him and his ingenious relations flounced
disgustedly away

But Leonidas was not spared any further allusion to the fair stranger
for the fact of her having spoken to him was duly reported at home and
at dinner his reticence was again sorely attacked Just like her in
spite of all her airs and graces to hang out along the fence like any
ordinary hired girl jabberin with anybody that went along the road
said his mother incisively He knew that she didnt like her new
neighbors so this did not surprise nor greatly pain him Neither did
the prosaic facts that were now first made plain to him His divinity
was a Mrs Burroughs whose husband was conducting a series of mining
operations and prospecting with a gang of men on the Casket Ridge
As his duty required his continual presence there Mrs Burroughs was
forced to forego the civilized pleasures of San Francisco for a frontier
life for which she was ill fitted and in which she had no interest
All this was a vague irrelevance to Leonidas who knew her only as a
goddess in white who had been familiar to him and kind and to whom he
was tied by the delicious joy of having a secret in common and having
done her a special favor Healthy youth clings to its own impressions
let reason experience and even facts argue ever to the contrary

So he kept her secret and his intact and was rewarded a few days
afterwards by a distant view of her walking in the garden with a man
whom he recognized as her husband It is needless to say that without
any extraneous thought the man suffered in Leonidass estimation by his
propinquity to the goddess and that he deemed him vastly inferior

It was a still greater reward to his fidelity that she seized an
opportunity when her husbands head was turned to wave her hand to him
Leonidas did not approach the fence partly through shyness and partly
through a more subtle instinct that this man was not in the secret He
was right for only the next day as he passed to the postoffice she
called him to the fence

Did you see me wave my hand to you yesterday she asked pleasantly

Yes maam buthe hesitatedI didnt come up for I didnt think
you wanted me when any one else was there

She laughed merrily and lifting his straw hat from his head ran the
fingers of the other hand through his damp curls Youre the brightest
dearest boy I ever knew Leon she said dropping her pretty face to
the level of his own and I ought to have remembered it But I
dont mind telling you I was dreadfully frightened lest you might
misunderstand me and come and ask for another letterbefore HIM As
she emphasized the personal pronoun her whole face seemed to change
the light of her blue eyes became mere glittering points her nostrils
grew white and contracted and her pretty little mouth seemed to narrow
into a straight cruel line like a cats Not a word ever to HIM
of all men Do you hear she said almost brusquely Then seeing the
concern in the boys face she laughed and added explanatorily Hes a
bad bad man Leon remember that

The fact that she was speaking of her husband did not shock the boys
moral sense in the least The sacredness of those relations and even of
blood kinship is I fear not always so clear to the youthful mind as
we fondly imagine That Mr Burroughs was a bad man to have excited
this change in this lovely woman was Leonidass only conclusion He
remembered how his sisters soft pretty little kitten purring on her
lap used to get its back up and spit at the postmasters yellow hound

I never wished to come unless you called me first he said frankly

What she said in her half playful half reproachful but wholly
caressing way You mean to say you would never come to see me unless I
sent for you Oh Leon and youd abandon me in that way

But Leonidas was set in his own boyish superstition Id just delight
in being sent for by you any time Mrs Burroughs and you kin always
find me he said shyly but doggedly butHe stopped

What an opinionated young gentleman Well I see I must do all the
courting So consider that I sent for you this morning Ive got another
letter for you to mail She put her hand to her breast and out of the
pretty frillings of her frock produced as before with the same faint
perfume of violets a letter like the first But it was unsealed Now
listen Leon we are going to be great friendsyou and I Leonidas
felt his cheeks glowing You are going to do me another great favor
and we are going to have a little fun and a great secret all by our own
selves Now first have you any correspondentyou knowany one who
writes to youany boy or girlfrom San Francisco

Leonidass cheeks grew redderalas from a less happy consciousness He
never received any letters nobody ever wrote to him He was obliged to
make this shameful admission

Mrs Burroughs looked thoughtful But you have some friend in San
Franciscosome one who MIGHT write to you she suggested pleasantly

I knew a boy once who went to San Francisco said Leonidas doubtfully
At least he allowed he was goin there

That will do said Mrs Burroughs I suppose your parents know him or
of him

Why said Leonidas he used to live here

Better still For you see it wouldnt be strange if he DID write
What was the gentlemans name

Jim Belcher returned Leonidas hesitatingly by no means sure that the
absent Belcher knew how to write Mrs Burroughs took a tiny pencil from
her belt opened the letter she was holding in her hand and apparently
wrote the name in it Then she folded it and sealed it smiling
charmingly at Leonidass puzzled face

Now Leon listen for here is the favor I am asking Mr Jim
Belchershe pronounced the name with great gravitywill write to you
in a few days But inside of YOUR letter will be a little note to me
which you will bring me You can show your letter to your family if
they want to know who it is from but no one must see MINE Can you
manage that

Yes said Leonidas Then as the whole idea flashed upon his quick
intelligence he smiled until he showed his dimples Mrs Burroughs
leaned forward over the fence lifted his torn straw hat and dropped
a fluttering little kiss on his forehead It seemed to the boy flushed
and rosy as a maid as if she had left a shining star there for every
one to see

Dont smile like that Leon youre positively irresistible It will be
a nice little game wont it Nobody in it but you and meand Belcher
Well outwit them yet And you see youll be obliged to come to me
after all without my asking

They both laughed indeed quite a dimpled brighteyed rosy innocent
pair though I think Leonidas was the more maidenly

And added Leonidas with breathless eagerness I can sometimes write
totoJim and inclose your letter

Angel of wisdom certainly Well now lets seehave you got any
letters for the post today He colored again for in anticipation of
meeting her he had hurried up the family post that morning He held out
his letters she thrust her own among them Now she said laying her
cool soft hand against his hot cheek run along dear you must not be
seen loitering here

Leonidas ran off buoyed up on ambient air It seemed just like a
fairybook Here he was the confidant of the most beautiful creature he
had seen and there was a mysterious letter coming to himLeonidasand
no one to know why And now he had a call to see her often she would
not forget himhe neednt loiter by the fencepost to see if she wanted
himand his boyish pride and shyness were appeased There was no
question of moral ethics raised in Leonidass mind he knew that it
would not be the real Jim Belcher who would write to him but that made
the prospect the more attractive Nor did another circumstance trouble
his conscience When he reached the postoffice he was surprised to see
the man whom he knew to be Mr Burroughs talking with the postmaster
Leonidas brushed by him and deposited his letters in the box in
discreet triumph The postmaster was evidently officially resenting some
imputation on his carelessness and concluding his defense No sir
he said you kin bet your boots that ef any letter hez gone astray for
you or your wifeYe said your wife didnt ye

Yes said Burroughs hastily with a glance around the shop

Well for you or anybody at your houseit aint here thats the fault
You hear me I know every letter that comes in and goes outer this
office I reckon and handle em allLeonidas pricked up his
earsand if anybody oughter know its me Ye kin paste that in your
hat Mr Burroughs Burroughs apparently disconcerted by the intrusion
of a third partyLeonidasupon what was evidently a private inquiry
murmured something surlily and passed out

Leonidas was puzzled That big man seemed to be snoopin around for
something He knew that he dared not touch the letterbagLeonidas had
heard somewhere that it was a deadly crime to touch any letters after
the Government had got hold of them once and he had no fears for the
safety of hers But ought he not go back at once and tell her about
her husbands visit and the alarming fact that the postmaster was
personally acquainted with all the letters He instantly saw too the
wisdom of her inclosing her letter hereafter in another address Yet he
finally resolved not to tell her todayit would look like hanging
round again andanother secret reasonhe was afraid that any
allusion to her husbands interference would bring back that change
in her beautiful face which he did not like The better to resist
temptation he went back another way

It must not be supposed that while Leonidas indulged in this secret
passion for the beautiful stranger it was to the exclusion of his
boyish habits It merely took the place of his intellectual visions and
his romantic reading He no longer carried books in his pocket on his
lazy rambles What were mediaeval legends of highborn ladies and their
pages to this real romance of himself and Mrs Burroughs What were the
exploits of boy captains and juvenile trappers and the Indian maidens
and Spanish senoritas to what was now possible to himself and his
divinity hereupon Casket Ridge The very ground around her was now
consecrated to romance and adventure Consequently he visited a
few traps on his way back which he had set for jackassrabbits and
wildcatsthe latter a vindictive reprisal for aggression upon an
orphan brood of mountain quail which he had taken under his protection
For while he nourished a keen love of sport it was controlled by a
boys larger understanding of nature a pantheistic sympathy with
man and beast and plant which made him keenly alive to the strange
cruelties of creation revealed to him some queer animal feuds and made
him a chivalrous partisan of the weaker He had even gone out of his way
to defend by ingenious contrivances of his own the hoard of a golden
squirrel and the treasures of some wild bees from a predatory bear
although it did not prevent him later from capturing the squirrel by an
equally ingenious contrivance and from eventually eating some of the
honey

He was late home that evening But this was vacationthe district
school was closed and but for the household chores which occupied
his early mornings each long summer day was a holiday So two or three
passed and then one morning on his going to the postoffice the
postmaster threw down upon the counter a real and rather bulky letter
duly stamped and addressed to Mr Leonidas Boone Leonidas was too
discreet to open it before witnesses but in the solitude of the
trail home broke the seal It contained another letter with no
addressclearly the one SHE expectedand more marvelous still a
sheaf of trouthooks with delicate gutsnells such as Leonidas had
only dared to dream of The letter to himself was written in a clear
distinct hand and ran as follows


DEAR LEEHow are you getting on on old Casket Ridge It seems a coons
age since you and me was together and times I get to think I must just
run up and see you Were having bully times in Frisco you bet though
there aint anything wild worth shucks to go to seecept the sea
lions at the Cliff House Theyre just stunningbig as a grizzly and
biggerclimbing over a big rock or swimming in the sea like an otter or
muskrat Im sending you some snells and hooks such as you cant get at
Casket Use the fine ones for potholes and the bigger ones for running
water or falls Let me know when youve got em Write to Lock Box No
1290 Thats where dads letters come So no more at present

From yours truly

JIM BELCHER


Not only did Leonidas know that this was not from the real Jim but he
felt the vague contact of a new charming and original personality
that fascinated him Of course it was only natural that one of HER
friendsas he must beshould be equally delightful There was no
jealousy in Leonidass devotion he knew only a joy in this fellowship
of admiration for her which he was satisfied that the other boy must
feel And only the right kind of boy could know the importance of
his ravishing gift and this Jim was evidently no slouch Yet in
Leonidass new joy he did not forget HER He ran back to the stockade
fence and lounged upon the road in view of the house but she did not
appear

Leonidas lingered on the top of the hill ostentatiously examining a
young hickory for a green switch but to no effect Then it suddenly
occurred to him that she might be staying in purposely and perhaps
a little piqued by her indifference he ran off There was a mountain
stream hard by now dwindled in the summer drouth to a mere trickling
thread among the boulders and there was a certain pothole that he
had long known It was the lurkingplace of a phenomenal troutan
almost historic fish in the district which had long resisted the
attempt of such rude sportsmen as miners or even experts like himself
Few had seen it except as a vague shadowy bulk in the four feet of
depth and gloom in which it hid only once had Leonidass quick eye
feasted on its fair proportions On that memorable occasion Leonidas
having exhausted every kind of lure of painted fly and living bait
was rising from his knees behind the bank when a pink fivecent stamp
dislodged from his pocket fluttered in the air and descended slowly
upon the still pool Horrified at his loss Leonidas leaned over to
recover it when there was a flash like lightning in the black depths a
dozen changes of light and shadow on the surface a little whirling wave
splashing against the side of the rock and the postage stamp was gone
More than thatfor one instant the trout remained visible stationary
and expectant Whether it was the instinct of sport or whether the fish
had detected a new subtle and original flavor in the gum and paper
Leonidas never knew Alas he had not another stamp he was obliged to
leave the fish but carried a brilliant idea away with him Ever since
then he had cherished itand another extra stamp in his pocket And
now with this strong but gossamerlike snell this new hook and this
freshly cut hickory rod he would make the trial

But fate was against him He had scarcely descended the narrow trail to
the pinefringed margin of the stream before his quick ear detected an
unusual rustling through the adjacent underbrush and then a voice that
startled him It was HERS In an instant all thought of sport had fled
With a beating heart half opened lips and uplifted lashes Leonidas
awaited the coming of his divinity like a timorous virgin at her first
tryst

But Mrs Burroughs was clearly not in an equally responsive mood With
her fair face reddened by the sun the damp tendrils of her unwound hair
clinging to her forehead and her smart little slippers red with dust
there was also a querulous light in her eyes and a still more querulous
pinch in her nostrils as she stood panting before him

You tiresome boy she gasped holding one little hand to her side as
she gripped her brambled skirt around her ankles with the other Why
didnt you wait Why did you make me run all this distance after you

Leonidas timidly and poignantly protested He had waited before the
house and on the hill he thought she didnt want him

Couldnt you see that THAT MAN kept me in she went on peevishly
Havent you sense enough to know that he suspects something and
follows me everywhere dogging my footsteps every time the post comes
in and even going to the postoffice himself to make sure that he sees
all my letters Well she added impatiently have you anything for me
Why dont you speak

Crushed and remorseful Leonidas produced her letter She almost
snatched it from his hand opened it read a few lines and her face
changed A smile strayed from her eyes to her lips and back again
Leonidass heart was lifted she was so forgiving and so beautiful

Is he a boy Mrs Burroughs asked Leonidas shyly

Wellnot exactly she said her charming face all radiant again
Hes older than you What has he written to you

Leonidas put his letter in her hand for reply

I wish I could see him you know he said shyly That letters
bullyits just rats I like him powful

Mrs Burroughs had skimmed through the letter but not interestedly

You mustnt like him more than you like me she said laughingly
caressing him with her voice and eyes and even her straying hand

I couldnt do that I never could like anybody as I like you said
Leonidas gravely There was such appalling truthfulness in the boys
voice and frankly opened eyes that the woman could not evade it and
was slightly disconcerted But she presently started up with a vexatious
cry Theres that wretch following me again I do believe she said
staring at the hilltop Yes Look Leon hes turning to come down this
trail Whats to be done He mustnt see me here

Leonidas looked It was indeed Mr Burroughs but he was evidently
only taking a short cut towards the Ridge where his men were working
Leonidas had seen him take it before But it was the principal trail on
the steep hillside and they must eventually meet A man might evade
it by scrambling through the brush to a lower and rougher trail but a
woman never But an idea had seized Leonidas I can stop him he said
confidently to her You just lie low here behind that rock till I come
back He hasnt seen you yet

She had barely time to draw back before Leonidas darted down the trail
towards her husband Yet in her intense curiosity she leaned out
the next moment to watch him He paused at last not far from the
approaching figure and seemed to kneel down on the trail What was he
doing Her husband was still slowly advancing Suddenly he stopped At
the same moment she heard their two voices in excited parley and then
to her amazement she saw her husband scramble hurriedly down the trail
to the lower level and with an occasional backward glance hasten away
until he had passed beyond her view

She could scarcely realize her narrow escape when Leonidas stood by her
side How did you do it she said eagerly

With a rattler said the boy gravely

With a what

A rattlesnakepizen snake you know

A rattlesnake she said staring at Leonidas with a quick snatching
away of her skirts

The boy who seemed to have forgotten her in his other abstraction of
adventure now turned quickly with devoted eyes and a reassuring smile

Yes but I wouldnt let him hurt you he said gently

But what did you DO

He looked at her curiously You wont be frightened if I show you he
said doubtfully Theres nothin to be afeerd of slong as youre with
me he added proudly

Yesthat isshe stammered and then her curiosity getting the
better of her fear she added in a whisper Show me quick

He led the way up the narrow trail until he stopped where he had knelt
before It was a narrow sunny ledge of rock scarcely wide enough for
a single person to pass He silently pointed to a cleft in the rock and
kneeling down again began to whistle in a soft fluttering way There
was a moment of suspense and then she was conscious of an awful gliding
somethinga movement so measured yet so exquisitely graceful that she
stood enthralled A narrow flattened expressionless head was followed
by a footlong strip of yellowbarred scales then there was a pause and
the head turned in a beautifully symmetrical halfcircle towards the
whistler The whistling ceased the snake with half its body out of the
cleft remained poised in air as if stiffened to stone

There said Leonidas quietly thats what Mr Burroughs saw and
thats WHY he scooted off the trail I just called out William HenryI
call him William Henry and he knows his nameand then I sang out to
Mr Burroughs what was up and it was lucky I did for the next moment
hed have been on top of him and have been struck for rattlers dont
give way to any one

Oh why didnt you letShe stopped herself quickly but could not
stop the fierce glint in her eye nor the sharp curve in her nostril
Luckily Leonidas did not see this being preoccupied with his other
graceful charmer William Henry

But how did you know it was here said Mrs Burroughs recovering
herself

Fetched him here said Leonidas briefly

What in your hands she said drawing back

No made him follow I HAVE handled him but it was after Id first
made him strike his pizen out upon a stick Ye know after he strikes
four times he aint got any pizen left Then ye kin do anythin with
him and he knows it He knows me you bet Ive bin three months
trainin him Look Dont be frightened he said as Mrs Burroughs
drew hurriedly back see him mind me Now scoot home William Henry

He accompanied the command with a slow dominant movement of the hickory
rod he was carrying The snake dropped its head and slid noiselessly
out of the cleft across the trail and down the hill

Thinks my rod is witchhazel which rattlers cant abide continued
Leonidas dropping into a boys breathless abbreviated speech Lives
down your wayjust back of your farm Show ye some day Suns himself on
a flat stone every dayalways coldnever can get warm Eh

She had not spoken but was gazing into space with a breathless rigidity
of attitude and a fixed look in her eye not unlike the motionless orbs
of the reptile that had glided away

Does anybody else know you keep him she asked

Nary one I never showed him to anybody but you replied the boy

Dont You must show me where he hides tomorrow she said in her old
laughing way And now Leon I must go back to the house

May I write to himto Jim Belcher Mrs Burroughs said the boy
timidly

Certainly And come to me tomorrow with your letterI will have mine
ready Goodby She stopped and glanced at the trail And you say that
if that man had kept on the snake would have bitten him

Sure popif hed trod on himas he was sure to The snake wouldnt
have known he didnt mean it Its only natural continued Leonidas
with glowing partisanship for the gentle and absent William Henry YOU
wouldnt like to be trodden upon Mrs Burroughs

No Id strike out she said quickly She made a rapid motion forward
with her low forehead and level head leaving it rigid the next moment
so that it reminded him of the snake and he laughed At which she
laughed too and tripped away

Leonidas went back and caught his trout But even this triumph did not
remove a vague sense of disappointment which had come over him He had
often pictured to himself a Heavensent meeting with her in the woods
a walk with her alone where he could pick her the rarest flowers and
herbs and show her his woodland friends and it had only ended in this
and an exhibition of William Henry He ought to have saved HER from
something and not her husband Yet he had no illfeeling for Burroughs
only a desire to circumvent him on behalf of the unprotected as he
would have baffled a hawk or a wildcat He went home in dismal spirits
but later that evening constructed a boyish letter of thanks to the
apocryphal Belcher and told him all aboutthe trout

He brought her his letter the next day and received hers to inclose
She was pleasant her own charming self again but she seemed more
interested in other things than himself as for instance the docile
William Henry whose hidingplace he showed and whose few tricks she
made him exhibit to her and which the gratified Leonidas accepted as a
delicate form of flattery to himself But his yearning innocent spirit
detected a something lacking which he was too proud to admit even to
himself It was his own fault he ought to have waited for her and not
gone for the trout

So a fortnight passed with an interchange of the vicarious letters and
brief hopeful and disappointing meetings to Leonidas To add to his
unhappiness he was obliged to listen to sneering disparagement of his
goddess from his family and criticisms which happily his innocence
did not comprehend It was his own mother who accused her of shamefully
making up to the goodlooking expressman at church last Sunday and
declared that Burroughs ought to look after that wife of histwo
statements which the simple Leonidas could not reconcile He had seen
the incident and only thought her more lovely than ever Why should not
the expressman think so too And yet the boy was not happy something
intruded upon his sports upon his books making them dull and vapid
and yet that something was she He grew pale and preoccupied If he had
only some one in whom to confidesome one who could explain his hopes
and fears That one was nearer than he thought

It was quite three weeks since the rattlesnake incident and he was
wandering moodily over Casket Ridge He was near the Casket that abrupt
upheaval of quartz and gneiss shaped like a coffer from which the
mountain took its name It was a favorite haunt of Leonidas one of
whose boyish superstitions was that it contained a treasure of gold and
one of whose brightest dreams had been that he should yet discover it
This he did not do today but looking up from the rocks that he was
listlessly examining he made the almost as thrilling discovery that
near him on the trail was a distinguishedlooking stranger

He was bestriding a shapely mustang which well became his handsome
face and slight elegant figure and he was looking at Leonidas with
an amused curiosity and a certain easy assurance that were difficult to
withstand It was with the same fascinating selfconfidence of smile
voice and manner that he rode up to the boy and leaning lightly over
his saddle said with exaggerated politeness I believe I have the
pleasure of addressing Mr Leonidas Boone

The rising color in Leonidass face was apparently a sufficient
answer to the stranger for he continued smilingly Then permit me to
introduce myself as Mr James Belcher As you perceive I have grown
considerably since you last saw me In fact Ive done nothing else
Its surprising what a fellow can do when he sets his mind on one thing
And then you know theyre always telling you that San Francisco is a
growing place That accounts for it

Leonidas dazed dazzled but delighted showed all his white teeth in a
shy laugh At which the enchanting stranger leaped from his horse like
a very boy drew his arm through the rein and going up to Leonidas
lifted the boys straw hat from his head and ran his fingers through his
curls There was nothing original in thateverybody did that to him as
a preliminary to conversation But when this ingenuous fine gentleman
put his own Panama hat on Leonidass head and clapped Leonidass torn
straw on his own and passing his arm through the boys began to walk
on with him Leonidass simple heart went out to him at once

And now Leon said the delightful stranger lets you and me have
a talk Theres a nice cool spot under these laurels Ill stake out
Pepita and well just lie off there and gab and not care if school
keeps or not

But you know you aint really Jim Belcher said the boy shyly

Im as good a man as he is any day whoever I am said the stranger
with humorous defiance and can lick him out of his boots whoever HE
is That ought to satisfy you But if you want my certificate heres
your own letter old man he said producing Leonidass last scrawl
from his pocket

And HERS said the boy cautiously

The strangers face changed a little And HERS he repeated gravely
showing a little pink note which Leonidas recognized as one of Mrs
Burroughss inclosures The boy was silent until they reached the
laurels where the stranger tethered his horse and then threw himself
in an easy attitude beneath the tree with the back of his head upon his
clasped hands Leonidas could see his curved brown mustaches and silky
lashes that were almost as long and thought him the handsomest man he
had ever beheld

Well Leon said the stranger stretching himself out comfortably and
pulling the boy down beside him how are things going on the Casket
All serene eh

The inquiry so dismally recalled Leonidass late feelings that his face
clouded and he involuntarily sighed The stranger instantly shifted his
head and gazed curiously at him Then he took the boys sunburnt hand in
his own and held it a moment Well go on he said

Well MrMrI cant go onI wont said Leonidas with a sudden
fit of obstinacy I dont know what to call you

Call me JackJack Hamlin when youre not in a hurry Ever heard of
me before he added suddenly turning his head towards Leonidas

The boy shook his head No

Mr Jack Hamlin lifted his lashes in affected expostulation to the
skies And this is Fame he murmured audibly

But this Leonidas did not comprehend Nor could he understand why the
stranger who clearly must have come to see HER should not ask about
her should not rush to seek her but should lie back there all the
while so contentedly on the grass HE wouldnt He half resented it and
then it occurred to him that this fine gentleman was like himselfshy
Who could help being so before such an angel HE would help him on

And so shyly at first but bit by bit emboldened by a word or two from
Jack he began to talk of herof her beautyof her kindnessof his
own unworthinessof what she had said and doneuntil finding in this
gracious stranger the vent his pentup feelings so long had sought he
sang then and there the little idyl of his boyish life He told of his
decline in her affections after his unpardonable sin in keeping her
waiting while he went for the trout and added the miserable mistake of
the rattlesnake episode For it was a mistake Mr Hamlin I oughtnt
to have let a lady like that know anything about snakesjust because I
happen to know them

It WAS an awful slump Lee said Hamlin gravely Get a woman and
a snake togetherand where are you Think of Adam and Eve and the
serpent you know

But it wasnt that way said the boy earnestly And I want to tell
you something else thats just makin me sick Mr Hamlin You know I
told you William Henry lives down at the bottom of Burroughss garden
and how I showed Mrs Burroughs his tricks Well only two days ago I
was down there looking for him and couldnt find him anywhere Theres
a sort of narrow trail from the garden to the hill a short cut up to
the Ridge instead o going by their gate Its just the trail any one
would take in a hurry or if they didnt want to be seen from the road
Well I was looking this way and that for William Henry and whistlin
for him when I slipped on to the trail There in the middle of it was
an old bucket turned upside downjust the thing a man would kick away
or a woman lift up Well Mr Hamlin I kicked it away andthe boy
stopped with rounded eyes and bated breath and addedI just had time
to give one jump and save myself For under that pail cramped down so
he couldnt get out and just bilin over with rage and chockful of
pizen was William Henry If it had been anybody else less spry theyd
have got bittenand thats just what the sneak who put it there knew

Mr Hamlin uttered an exclamation under his breath and rose to his
feet

What did you say asked the boy quickly

Nothing said Mr Hamlin

But it had sounded to Leonidas like an oath

Mr Hamlin walked a few steps as if stretching his limbs and then
said And you think Burroughs would have been bitten

Why no said Leonidas in astonished indignation of course notnot
BURROUGHS It would have been poor MRS Burroughs For of course HE
set that trap for herdont you see Who else would do it

Of course of course Certainly said Mr Hamlin coolly Of course
as you say HE set the trapyesyou just hang on to that idea

But something in Mr Hamlins manner and a peculiar look in his eye
did not satisfy Leonidas Are you going to see her now he said
eagerly I can show you the house and then run in and tell her youre
outside in the laurels

Not just yet said Mr Hamlin laying his hand on the boys head
after having restored his own hat You see I thought of giving her a
surprise A big surprise he added slowly After a pause he went on
Did you tell her what you had seen

Of course I did said Leonidas reproachfully Did you think I was
going to let her get bit It might have killed her

And it might not have been an unmixed pleasure for William Henry I
mean said Mr Hamlin gravely correcting himself YOU would never
have forgiven him But what did she say

The boys face clouded She thanked me and said it was very
thoughtfuland kindthough it might have been only an accidenthe
stammeredand then she said perhaps I was hanging round and coming
there a little too much lately and that as Burroughs was very watchful
Id better quit for two or three days The tears were rising to his
eyes but by putting his two clenched fists into his pockets he managed
to hold them down Perhaps Mr Hamlins soft hand on his head assisted
him Mr Hamlin took from his pocket a notebook and tearing out a leaf
sat down again and began to write on his knee After a pause Leonidas
said

Was you ever in love Mr Hamlin

Never said Mr Hamlin quietly continuing to write But now you
speak of it its a longfelt want in my nature that I intend to supply
some day But not until Ive made my pile And dont YOU either He
continued writing for it was this gentlemans peculiarity to talk
without apparently the slightest concern whether anybody else spoke
whether he was listened to or whether his remarks were at all relevant
to the case Yet he was always listened to for that reason When he had
finished writing he folded up the paper put it in an envelope and
addressed it

Shall I take it to her said Leonidas eagerly

Its not for HER its for himMr Burroughs said Mr Hamlin
quietly

The boy drew back To get him out of the way added Hamlin
explanatorily When he gets it lightning wouldnt keep him here Now
how to send it he said thoughtfully

You might leave it at the postoffice said Leonidas timidly He
always goes there to watch his wifes letters

For the first time in their interview Mr Hamlin distinctly laughed

Your head is level Leo and Ill do it Now the best thing you can do
is to follow Mrs Burroughss advice Quit going to the house for a day
or two He walked towards his horse The boys face sank but he kept
up bravely And will I see you again he said wistfully

Mr Hamlin lowered his face so near the boys that Leonidas could see
himself in the brown depths of Mr Hamlins eyes I hope you will
he said gravely He mounted shook the boys hand and rode away in the
lengthening shadows Then Leonidas walked sadly home

There was no need for him to keep his promise for the next morning the
family were stirred by the announcement that Mr and Mrs Burroughs had
left Casket Ridge that night by the down stage for Sacramento and that
the house was closed There were various rumors concerning the reason of
this sudden departure but only one was persistent and borne out by
the postmaster It was that Mr Burroughs had received that afternoon an
anonymous note that his wife was about to elope with the notorious San
Francisco gambler Jack Hamlin

But Leonidas Boone albeit half understanding kept his miserable secret
with a still hopeful and trustful heart It grieved him a little that
William Henry was found a few days later dead with his head crushed
Yet it was not until years later when he had made a successful
prospect on Casket Ridge that he met Mr Hamlin in San Francisco
and knew how he had played the part of Mercury upon that heavenkissing
hill




COLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF


It had been a day of triumph for Colonel Starbottle First for his
personality as it would have been difficult to separate the Colonels
achievements from his individuality second for his oratorical
abilities as a sympathetic pleader and third for his functions as the
leading legal counsel for the Eureka Ditch Company versus the State of
California On his strictly legal performances in this issue I prefer
not to speak there were those who denied them although the jury had
accepted them in the face of the ruling of the half amused half cynical
Judge himself For an hour they had laughed with the Colonel wept with
him been stirred to personal indignation or patriotic exaltation by
his passionate and lofty periodswhat else could they do than give him
their verdict If it was alleged by some that the American eagle Thomas
Jefferson and the Resolutions of 98 had nothing whatever to do with
the contest of a ditch company over a doubtfully worded legislative
document that wholesale abuse of the State Attorney and his political
motives had not the slightest connection with the legal question
raisedit was nevertheless generally accepted that the losing party
would have been only too glad to have the Colonel on their side And
Colonel Starbottle knew this as perspiring florid and panting he
rebuttoned the lower buttons of his blue frockcoat which had become
loosed in an oratorical spasm and readjusted his oldfashioned
spotless shirt frill above it as he strutted from the courtroom amidst
the handshakings and acclamations of his friends

And here an unprecedented thing occurred The Colonel absolutely
declined spirituous refreshment at the neighboring Palmetto Saloon
and declared his intention of proceeding directly to his office in the
adjoining square Nevertheless the Colonel quitted the building alone
and apparently unarmed except for his faithful goldheaded stick
which hung as usual from his forearm The crowd gazed after him with
undisguised admiration of this new evidence of his pluck It was
remembered also that a mysterious note had been handed to him at
the conclusion of his speechevidently a challenge from the State
Attorney It was quite plain that the Colonela practiced duelistwas
hastening home to answer it

But herein they were wrong The note was in a female hand and simply
requested the Colonel to accord an interview with the writer at the
Colonels office as soon as he left the court But it was an engagement
that the Colonelas devoted to the fair sex as he was to the
codewas no less prompt in accepting He flicked away the dust from
his spotless white trousers and varnished boots with his handkerchief
and settled his black cravat under his Byron collar as he neared his
office He was surprised however on opening the door of his private
office to find his visitor already there he was still more startled to
find her somewhat past middle age and plainly attired But the Colonel
was brought up in a school of Southern politeness already antique in
the republic and his bow of courtesy belonged to the epoch of his
shirt frill and strapped trousers No one could have detected his
disappointment in his manner albeit his sentences were short
and incomplete But the Colonels colloquial speech was apt to be
fragmentary incoherencies of his larger oratorical utterances

A thousand pardonsforerhaving kept a lady waitinger
Butercongratulations of friendsandercourtesy due to
themerinterfered withthough perhaps only heightenedby
procrastinationthe pleasure ofha And the Colonel completed his
sentence with a gallant wave of his fat but white and wellkept hand

Yes I came to see you along o that speech of yours I was in court
When I heard you gettin it off on that jury I says to myself Thats
the kind o lawyer I want A man thats flowery and convincin Just the
man to take up our case

Ah Its a matter of business I see said the Colonel inwardly
relieved but externally careless Andermay I ask the nature of the
case

Well its a breachopromise suit said the visitor calmly

If the Colonel had been surprised before he was now really startled
and with an added horror that required all his politeness to conceal
Breachofpromise cases were his peculiar aversion He had always held
them to be a kind of litigation which could have been obviated by the
prompt killing of the masculine offenderin which case he would have
gladly defended the killer But a suit for damagesDAMAGESwith the
reading of loveletters before a hilarious jury and court was against
all his instincts His chivalry was outraged his sense of humor was
small and in the course of his career he had lost one or two important
cases through an unexpected development of this quality in a jury

The woman had evidently noticed his hesitation but mistook its cause
It aint mebut my darter

The Colonel recovered his politeness Ah I am relieved my dear madam
I could hardly conceive a man ignorant enough toererthrow away
such evident good fortuneor base enough to deceive the trustfulness of
womanhoodmatured and experienced only in the chivalry of our sex ha

The woman smiled grimly Yesits my darter Zaidee Hookerso ye
might spare some of them pretty speeches for HERbefore the jury

The Colonel winced slightly before this doubtful prospect but smiled
Ha Yescertainlythe jury Butermy dear lady need we go as
far as that Can not this affair be settlederout of court Could
not thiserindividualbe admonishedtold that he must
give satisfactionpersonal satisfactionfor his dastardly
conducttoernear relativeor even valued personal friend
Theerarrangements necessary for that purpose I myself would
undertake

He was quite sincere indeed his small black eyes shone with that fire
which a pretty woman or an affair of honor could alone kindle The
visitor stared vacantly at him and said slowly And what good is that
goin to do US

Compel him toerperform his promise said the Colonel leaning back
in his chair

Ketch him doin it she exclaimed scornfully Nothat aint wot
were after We must make him PAY Damagesand nothin short o THAT

The Colonel bit his lip I suppose he said gloomily you have
documentary evidencewritten promises and protestationserer
loveletters in fact

Nonary a letter Ye see thats jest itand thats where YOU come
in Youve got to convince that jury yourself Youve got to show what
it istell the whole story your own way Lord to a man like you thats
nothin

Startling as this admission might have been to any other lawyer
Starbottle was absolutely relieved by it The absence of any
mirthprovoking correspondence and the appeal solely to his own powers
of persuasion actually struck his fancy He lightly put aside the
compliment with a wave of his white hand

Of course he said confidently there is strongly presumptive and
corroborative evidence Perhaps you can give meera brief outline of
the affair

Zaidee kin do that straight enough I reckon said the woman what I
want to know first is kin you take the case

The Colonel did not hesitate his curiosity was piqued I certainly
can I have no doubt your daughter will put me in possession of
sufficient facts and detailsto constitute what we callera brief

She kin be brief enoughor long enoughfor the matter of that said
the woman rising The Colonel accepted this implied witticism with a
smile

And when may I have the pleasure of seeing her he asked politely

Well I reckon as soon as I can trot out and call her Shes just
outside meanderin in the roadkinder shy ye know at first

She walked to the door The astounded Colonel nevertheless gallantly
accompanied her as she stepped out into the street and called shrilly
You Zaidee

A young girl here apparently detached herself from a tree and the
ostentatious perusal of an old election poster and sauntered down
towards the office door Like her mother she was plainly dressed
unlike her she had a pale rather refined face with a demure mouth and
downcast eyes This was all the Colonel saw as he bowed profoundly and
led the way into his office for she accepted his salutations without
lifting her head He helped her gallantly to a chair on which she
seated herself sideways somewhat ceremoniously with her eyes following
the point of her parasol as she traced a pattern on the carpet A second
chair offered to the mother that lady however declined I reckon to
leave you and Zaidee together to talk it out she said turning to her
daughter she added Jest you tell him all Zaidee and before the
Colonel could rise again disappeared from the room In spite of his
professional experience Starbottle was for a moment embarrassed The
young girl however broke the silence without looking up

Adoniram K Hotchkiss she began in a monotonous voice as if it were
a recitation addressed to the public first began to take notice of me
a year ago Arter thatoff and on

One moment interrupted the astounded Colonel do you mean Hotchkiss
the President of the Ditch Company He had recognized the name of
a prominent citizena rigid ascetic taciturn middleaged mana
deaconand more than that the head of the company he had just
defended It seemed inconceivable

Thats him she continued with eyes still fixed on the parasol and
without changing her monotonous toneoff and on ever since Most
of the time at the FreeWill Baptist Churchat morning service
prayermeetings and such And at homeoutsideerin the road

Is it this gentlemanMr Adoniram K Hotchkisswhoerpromised
marriage stammered the Colonel

Yes

The Colonel shifted uneasily in his chair Most extraordinary foryou
seemy dear young ladythis becomesaermost delicate affair

Thats what maw said returned the young woman simply yet with the
faintest smile playing around her demure lips and downcast cheek

I mean said the Colonel with a pained yet courteous smile that
thisergentlemanis in facterone of my clients

Thats what maw said too and of course your knowing him will make it
all the easier for you

A slight flush crossed the Colonels cheek as he returned quickly and a
little stiffly On the contraryerit may make it impossible for me
toeract in this matter

The girl lifted her eyes The Colonel held his breath as the long lashes
were raised to his level Even to an ordinary observer that sudden
revelation of her eyes seemed to transform her face with subtle
witchery They were large brown and soft yet filled with an
extraordinary penetration and prescience They were the eyes of an
experienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child What else the
Colonel saw there Heaven only knows He felt his inmost secrets
plucked from himhis whole soul laid barehis vanity belligerency
gallantryeven his mediaeval chivalry penetrated and yet illuminated
in that single glance And when the eyelids fell again he felt that a
greater part of himself had been swallowed up in them

I beg your pardon he said hurriedly I meanthis matter may
be arrangederamicably My interest withand as you wisely
saymyerknowledge of my clienterMr Hotchkissmay effecta
compromise

And DAMAGES said the young girl readdressing her parasol as if she
had never looked up

The Colonel winced Anderundoubtedly COMPENSATIONif you do not
press a fulfillment of the promise Unless he said with an attempted
return to his former easy gallantry which however the recollection of
her eyes made difficult it is a question oferthe affections

Which asked his fair client softly

If you still love him explained the Colonel actually blushing

Zaidee again looked up again taking the Colonels breath away with eyes
that expressed not only the fullest perception of what he had SAID but
of what he thought and had not said and with an added subtle suggestion
of what he might have thought Thats tellin she said dropping her
long lashes again

The Colonel laughed vacantly Then feeling himself growing imbecile he
forced an equally weak gravity Pardon meI understand there are no
letters may I know the way in which he formulated his declaration and
promises

Hymnbooks

I beg your pardon said the mystified lawyer

Hymnbooksmarked words in them with penciland passed em on to
me repeated Zaidee Like love dear precious sweet and
blessed she added accenting each word with a push of her parasol on
the carpet Sometimes a whole line outer Tate and Bradyand Solomons
Song you know and sich

I believe said the Colonel loftily that theerphrases of sacred
psalmody lend themselves to the language of the affections But in
regard to the distinct promise of marriagewas thereerno OTHER
expression

Marriage Service in the prayerbooklines and words outer thatall
marked Zaidee replied

The Colonel nodded naturally and approvingly Very good Were others
cognizant of this Were there any witnesses

Of course not said the girl Only me and him It was generally at
churchtimeor prayermeeting Once in passing the plate he slipped
one o them peppermint lozenges with the letters stamped on it I love
you for me to take

The Colonel coughed slightly And you have the lozenge

I ate it

Ah said the Colonel After a pause he added delicately But were
these attentionserconfined toersacred precincts Did he meet you
elsewhere

Useter pass our house on the road returned the girl dropping into
her monotonous recital and useter signal

Ah signal repeated the Colonel approvingly

Yes Hed say Keerow and Id say Keeree Suthing like a bird you
know

Indeed as she lifted her voice in imitation of the call the Colonel
thought it certainly very sweet and birdlike At least as SHE gave
it With his remembrance of the grim deacon he had doubts as to the
melodiousness of HIS utterance He gravely made her repeat it

And after that signal he added suggestively

Hed pass on

The Colonel again coughed slightly and tapped his desk with his
penholder

Were there any endearmentsercaressesersuch as taking your
handerclasping your waist he suggested with a gallant yet
respectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head erslight
pressure of your fingers in the changes of a danceI mean he
corrected himself with an apologetic coughin the passing of the
plate

No he was not what youd call fond returned the girl

Ah Adoniram K Hotchkiss was not fond in the ordinary acceptance of
the word noted the Colonel with professional gravity

She lifted her disturbing eyes and again absorbed his in her own She
also said Yes although her eyes in their mysterious prescience of all
he was thinking disclaimed the necessity of any answer at all He smiled
vacantly There was a long pause On which she slowly disengaged her
parasol from the carpet pattern and stood up

I reckon thats about all she said

Eryesbut one moment began the Colonel vaguely He would have
liked to keep her longer but with her strange premonition of him he
felt powerless to detain her or explain his reason for doing so He
instinctively knew she had told him all his professional judgment told
him that a more hopeless case had never come to his knowledge Yet he
was not daunted only embarrassed No matter he said Of course I
shall have to consult with you again

Her eyes again answered that she expected he would and she added
simply When

In the course of a day or two he replied quickly I will send you
word

She turned to go In his eagerness to open the door for her he upset
his chair and with some confusion that was actually youthful he
almost impeded her movements in the hall and knocked his broadbrimmed
Panama hat from his bowing hand in a final gallant sweep Yet as her
small trim youthful figure with its simple Leghorn straw hat confined
by a blue bow under her round chin passed away before him she looked
more like a child than ever

The Colonel spent that afternoon in making diplomatic inquiries He
found his youthful client was the daughter of a widow who had a small
ranch on the crossroads near the new FreeWill Baptist Churchthe
evident theatre of this pastoral They led a secluded life the
girl being little known in the town and her beauty and fascination
apparently not yet being a recognized fact The Colonel felt a
pleasurable relief at this and a general satisfaction he could not
account for His few inquiries concerning Mr Hotchkiss only confirmed
his own impressions of the alleged lovera seriousminded practically
abstracted man abstentive of youthful society and the last man
apparently capable of levity of the affections or serious flirtation
The Colonel was mystified but determined of purpose whatever that
purpose might have been

The next day he was at his office at the same hour He was aloneas
usualthe Colonels office being really his private lodgings disposed
in connecting rooms a single apartment reserved for consultation
He had no clerk his papers and briefs being taken by his faithful
bodyservant and exslave Jim to another firm who did his office work
since the death of Major Stryker the Colonels only law partner who
fell in a duel some years previous With a fine constancy the Colonel
still retained his partners name on his doorplate and it was alleged
by the superstitious kept a certain invincibility also through the
manes of that lamented and somewhat feared man

The Colonel consulted his watch whose heavy gold case still showed
the marks of a providential interference with a bullet destined for its
owner and replaced it with some difficulty and shortness of breath in
his fob At the same moment he heard a step in the passage and the door
opened to Adoniram K Hotchkiss The Colonel was impressed he had a
duelists respect for punctuality

The man entered with a nod and the expectant inquiring look of a busy
man As his feet crossed that sacred threshold the Colonel became all
courtesy he placed a chair for his visitor and took his hat from his
half reluctant hand He then opened a cupboard and brought out a bottle
of whiskey and two glasses

Aerslight refreshment Mr Hotchkiss he suggested politely

I never drink replied Hotchkiss with the severe attitude of a total
abstainer

Ahernot the finest Bourbon whiskey selected by a Kentucky friend
No Pardon me A cigar thenthe mildest Havana

I do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form repeated Hotchkiss
ascetically I have no foolish weaknesses

The Colonels moist beady eyes swept silently over his clients sallow
face He leaned back comfortably in his chair and half closing his
eyes as in dreamy reminiscence said slowly Your reply Mr Hotchkiss
reminds me ofersinglar circumstance thateroccurred in point of
factat the St Charles Hotel New Orleans Pinkey Hornblowerpersonal
friendinvited Senator Doolittle to join him in social glass Received
singlarly enough reply similar to yours Dont drink nor smoke said
Pinkey Gad sir you must be mighty sweet on the ladies Ha
The Colonel paused long enough to allow the faint flush to pass from
Hotchkisss cheek and went on half closing his eyes I allow no man
sir to discuss my personal habits declared Doolittle over his shirt
collar Then I reckon shootin must be one of those habits said
Pinkey coolly Both men drove out on the Shell Road back of cemetery
next morning Pinkey put bullet at twelve paces through Doolittles
temple Poor Doo never spoke again Left three wives and seven children
they saytwo of em black

I got a note from you this morning said Hotchkiss with badly
concealed impatience I suppose in reference to our case You have
taken judgment I believe

The Colonel without replying slowly filled a glass of whiskey and
water For a moment he held it dreamily before him as if still engaged
in gentle reminiscences called up by the act Then tossing it off
he wiped his lips with a large white handkerchief and leaning back
comfortably in his chair said with a wave of his hand The interview
I requested Mr Hotchkiss concerns a subjectwhich I may say
isererat present NOT of a public or business naturealthough
LATER it might becomeererboth It is an affair of
someerdelicacy

The Colonel paused and Mr Hotchkiss regarded him with increased
impatience The Colonel however continued with unchanged
deliberation It concernserera young ladya beautiful
highsouled creature sir who apart from her personal
lovelinessererI may say is of one of the first families of
Missouri andernot remotely connected by marriage with one
oferermy boyhoods dearest friends The latter I grieve to say
was a pure invention of the Colonelsan oratorical addition to the
scanty information he had obtained the previous day The young lady
he continued blandly enjoys the further distinction of being
the object of such attention from you as would make this
interviewreallya confidential mattererer among friends
andererrelations in present and future I need not say that the
lady I refer to is Miss Zaidee Juno Hooker only daughter of Almira
Ann Hooker relict of Jefferson Brown Hooker formerly of Boone County
Kentucky and latterly oferPike County Missouri

The sallow ascetic hue of Mr Hotchkisss face had passed through a
livid and then a greenish shade and finally settled into a sullen red
Whats all this about he demanded roughly

The least touch of belligerent fire came into Starbottles eye but his
bland courtesy did not change I believe he said politely I have
made myself clear as betweenergentlemen though perhaps not as clear
as I should toererjury

Mr Hotchkiss was apparently struck with some significance in the
lawyers reply I dont know he said in a lower and more cautious
voice what you mean by what you call my attentions toany oneor
how it concerns you I have not exchanged half a dozen words withthe
person you namehave never written her a linenor even called at her
house

He rose with an assumption of ease pulled down his waistcoat buttoned
his coat and took up his hat The Colonel did not move

I believe I have already indicated my meaning in what I have called
your attentions said the Colonel blandly and given you my
concern for speaking aserermutual friend As to YOUR statement
of your relations with Miss Hooker I may state that it is fully
corroborated by the statement of the young lady herself in this very
office yesterday

Then what does this impertinent nonsense mean Why am I summoned here
demanded Hotchkiss furiously

Because said the Colonel deliberately that statement is
infamouslyyes damnably to your discredit sir

Mr Hotchkiss was here seized by one of those impotent and inconsistent
rages which occasionally betray the habitually cautious and timid man
He caught up the Colonels stick which was lying on the table At the
same moment the Colonel without any apparent effort grasped it by
the handle To Mr Hotchkisss astonishment the stick separated in two
pieces leaving the handle and about two feet of narrow glittering steel
in the Colonels hand The man recoiled dropping the useless fragment
The Colonel picked it up fitted the shining blade in it clicked the
spring and then rising with a face of courtesy yet of unmistakably
genuine pain and with even a slight tremor in his voice said
gravely

Mr Hotchkiss I owe you a thousand apologies sir thatera weapon
should be drawn by meeven through your own inadvertenceunder the
sacred protection of my roof and upon an unarmed man I beg your
pardon sir and I even withdraw the expressions which provoked
that inadvertence Nor does this apology prevent you from holding me
responsiblepersonally responsibleELSEWHERE for an indiscretion
committed in behalf of a ladymyerclient

Your client Do you mean you have taken her case You the counsel for
the Ditch Company asked Mr Hotchkiss in trembling indignation

Having won YOUR case sir replied the Colonel coolly
theerusages of advocacy do not prevent me from espousing the cause
of the weak and unprotected

We shall see sir said Hotchkiss grasping the handle of the door and
backing into the passage There are other lawyers who

Permit me to see you out interrupted the Colonel rising politely

will be ready to resist the attacks of blackmail continued
Hotchkiss retreating along the passage

And then you will be able to repeat your remarks to me IN THE STREET
continued the Colonel bowing as he persisted in following his visitor
to the door

But here Mr Hotchkiss quickly slammed it behind him and hurried away
The Colonel returned to his office and sitting down took a sheet of
letterpaper bearing the inscription Starbottle and Stryker Attorneys
and Counselors and wrote the following lines


HOOKER versus HOTCHKISS

DEAR MADAMHaving had a visit from the defendant in above we should
be pleased to have an interview with you at two P M tomorrow

Your obedient servants

STARBOTTLE AND STRYKER


This he sealed and dispatched by his trusted servant Jim and then
devoted a few moments to reflection It was the custom of the Colonel to
act first and justify the action by reason afterwards

He knew that Hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival
counsel He knew that they would advise him that Miss Hooker had no
casethat she would be nonsuited on her own evidence and he ought not
to compromise but be ready to stand trial He believed however that
Hotchkiss feared such exposure and although his own instincts had been
at first against this remedy he was now instinctively in favor of it
He remembered his own power with a jury his vanity and his chivalry
alike approved of this heroic method he was bound by no prosaic
factshe had his own theory of the case which no mere evidence could
gainsay In fact Mrs Hookers admission that he was to tell the story
in his own way actually appeared to him an inspiration and a prophecy

Perhaps there was something else due possibly to the ladys wonderful
eyes of which he had thought much Yet it was not her simplicity that
affected him solely on the contrary it was her apparent intelligent
reading of the character of her recreant loverand of his own Of all
the Colonels previous light or serious loves none had ever before
flattered him in that way And it was this combined with the respect
which he had held for their professional relations that precluded
his having a more familiar knowledge of his client through serious
questioning or playful gallantry I am not sure it was not part of the
charm to have a rustic femme incomprise as a client

Nothing could exceed the respect with which he greeted her as she
entered his office the next day He even affected not to notice that she
had put on her best clothes and he made no doubt appeared as when
she had first attracted the mature yet faithless attentions of Deacon
Hotchkiss at church A white virginal muslin was belted around her slim
figure by a blue ribbon and her Leghorn hat was drawn around her oval
cheek by a bow of the same color She had a Southern girls narrow feet
encased in white stockings and kid slippers which were crossed primly
before her as she sat in a chair supporting her arm by her faithful
parasol planted firmly on the floor A faint odor of southernwood
exhaled from her and oddly enough stirred the Colonel with a faroff
recollection of a pineshaded Sundayschool on a Georgia hillside and
of his first love aged ten in a short starched frock Possibly it was
the same recollection that revived something of the awkwardness he had
felt then

He however smiled vaguely and sitting down coughed slightly and
placed his fingertips together I have had anerinterview with
Mr Hotchkiss butIerregret to say there seems to be no prospect
ofercompromise

He paused and to his surprise her listless company face lit up with
an adorable smile Of courseketch him she said Was he mad when
you told him She put her knees comfortably together and leaned forward
for a reply

For all that wild horses could not have torn from the Colonel a word
about Hotchkisss anger He expressed his intention of employing
counseland defending a suit returned the Colonel affably basking in
her smile

She dragged her chair nearer his desk Then youll fight him tooth and
nail she asked eagerly youll show him up Youll tell the whole
story your own way Youll give him fitsand youll make him pay
Sure she went on breathlessly

Ierwill said the Colonel almost as breathlessly

She caught his fat white hand which was lying on the table between
her own and lifted it to her lips He felt her soft young fingers even
through the lislethread gloves that encased them and the warm moisture
of her lips upon his skin He felt himself flushingbut was unable
to break the silence or change his position The next moment she had
scuttled back with her chair to her old position

Iercertainly shall do my best stammered the Colonel in an
attempt to recover his dignity and composure

Thats enough Youll do it said she enthusiastically Lordy Just
you talk for ME as ye did for HIS old Ditch Company and youll fetch
itevery time Why when you made that jury sit up the other daywhen
you got that off about the Merrikan flag waving equally over the rights
of honest citizens banded together in peaceful commercial pursuits as
well as over the fortress of official proflig

Oligarchy murmured the Colonel courteously

oligarchy repeated the girl quickly my breath was just took away
I said to maw Aint he too sweet for anything I did honest Injin
And when you rolled it all off at the endnever missing a word you
didnt need to mark em in a lessonbook but had em all ready on your
tongueand walked outWell I didnt know you nor the Ditch Company
from Adam but I could have just run over and kissed you there before
the whole court

She laughed with her face glowing although her strange eyes were cast
down Alack the Colonels face was equally flushed and his own beady
eyes were on his desk To any other woman he would have voiced the banal
gallantry that he should now himself look forward to that reward but
the words never reached his lips He laughed coughed slightly and when
he looked up again she had fallen into the same attitude as on her first
visit with her parasol point on the floor

I must ask you toerdirect your memory toeranother point the
breaking off of theerererengagement Did heergive any reason
for it Or show any cause

No he never said anything returned the girl

Not in his usual wayerno reproaches out of the hymnbookor the
sacred writings

No he just QUIT

Erceased his attentions said the Colonel gravely And naturally
youerwere not conscious of any cause for his doing so

The girl raised her wonderful eyes so suddenly and so penetratingly
without replying in any other way that the Colonel could only hurriedly
say I see None of course

At which she rose the Colonel rising also Weshall begin proceedings
at once I must however caution you to answer no questions nor say
anything about this case to any one until you are in court

She answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod He
accompanied her to the door As he took her proffered hand he raised
the lislethread fingers to his lips with oldfashioned gallantry As if
that act had condoned for his first omissions and awkwardness he became
his oldfashioned self again buttoned his coat pulled out his shirt
frill and strutted back to his desk

A day or two later it was known throughout the town that Zaidee Hooker
had sued Adoniram Hotchkiss for breach of promise and that the damages
were laid at five thousand dollars As in those bucolic days the Western
press was under the secure censorship of a revolver a cautious tone of
criticism prevailed and any gossip was confined to personal expression
and even then at the risk of the gossiper Nevertheless the situation
provoked the intensest curiosity The Colonel was approacheduntil
his statement that he should consider any attempt to overcome his
professional secrecy a personal reflection withheld further advances
The community were left to the more ostentatious information of the
defendants counsel Messrs Kitcham and Bilser that the case was
ridiculous and rotten that the plaintiff would be nonsuited and
the fireeating Starbottle would be taught a lesson that he could not
bully the law and there were some dark hints of a conspiracy It was
even hinted that the case was the revengeful and preposterous outcome
of the refusal of Hotchkiss to pay Starbottle an extravagant fee for his
late services to the Ditch Company It is unnecessary to say that these
words were not reported to the Colonel It was however an unfortunate
circumstance for the calmer ethical consideration of the subject that
the Church sided with Hotchkiss as this provoked an equal adherence
to the plaintiff and Starbottle on the part of the larger body of
nonchurchgoers who were delighted at a possible exposure of the
weakness of religious rectitude Ive allus had my suspicions o them
early candlelight meetings down at that gospel shop said one critic
and I reckon Deacon Hotchkiss didnt rope in the gals to attend jest
for psalmsinging Then for him to get up and leave the board afore
the games finished and try to sneak out of it said an otherI
suppose thats what they call RELIGIOUS

It was therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three weeks later
was crowded with an excited multitude of the curious and sympathizing
The fair plaintiff with her mother was early in attendance and under
the Colonels advice appeared in the same modest garb in which she had
first visited his office This and her downcast modest demeanor were
perhaps at first disappointing to the crowd who had evidently expected
a paragon of loveliness in this Circe of that grim ascetic defendant
who sat beside his counsel But presently all eyes were fixed on the
Colonel who certainly made up in his appearance any deficiency of his
fair client His portly figure was clothed in a blue dress coat with
brass buttons a buff waistcoat which permitted his frilled shirtfront
to become erectile above it a black satin stock which confined a boyish
turneddown collar around his full neck and immaculate drill trousers
strapped over varnished boots A murmur ran round the court Old
Personally Responsible has got his warpaint on The Old WarHorse
is smelling powder were whispered comments Yet for all that the
most irreverent among them recognized vaguely in this bizarre figure
something of an honored past in their countrys history and possibly
felt the spell of old deeds and old names that had once thrilled their
boyish pulses The new District Judge returned Colonel Starbottles
profoundly punctilious bow The Colonel was followed by his negro
servant carrying a parcel of hymnbooks and Bibles who with a
courtesy evidently imitated from his master placed one before the
opposite counsel This after a first curious glance the lawyer
somewhat superciliously tossed aside But when Jim proceeding to the
jurybox placed with equal politeness the remaining copies before the
jury the opposite counsel sprang to his feet

I want to direct the attention of the Court to this unprecedented
tampering with the jury by this gratuitous exhibition of matter
impertinent and irrelevant to the issue

The Judge cast an inquiring look at Colonel Starbottle

May it please the Court returned Colonel Starbottle with dignity
ignoring the counsel the defendants counsel will observe that he
is already furnished with the matterwhich I regret to say he has
treatedin the presence of the Courtand of his client a deacon of
the churchwithergreat superciliousness When I state to your
Honor that the books in question are hymnbooks and copies of the Holy
Scriptures and that they are for the instruction of the jury to whom
I shall have to refer them in the course of my opening I believe I am
within my rights

The act is certainly unprecedented said the Judge dryly but unless
the counsel for the plaintiff expects the jury to SING from these
hymnbooks their introduction is not improper and I cannot admit the
objection As defendants counsel are furnished with copies also they
cannot plead surprise as in the introduction of new matter and as
plaintiffs counsel relies evidently upon the jurys attention to his
opening he would not be the first person to distract it After a pause
he added addressing the Colonel who remained standing The Court is
with you sir proceed

But the Colonel remained motionless and statuesque with folded arms

I have overruled the objection repeated the Judge you may go on

I am waiting your Honor for theerwithdrawal by the defendants
counsel of the word tampering as refers to myself and of
impertinent as refers to the sacred volumes

The request is a proper one and I have no doubt will be acceded to
returned the Judge quietly The defendants counsel rose and mumbled
a few words of apology and the incident closed There was however a
general feeling that the Colonel had in some way scored and if his
object had been to excite the greatest curiosity about the books he had
made his point

But impassive of his victory he inflated his chest with his right hand
in the breast of his buttoned coat and began His usual high color had
paled slightly but the small pupils of his prominent eyes glittered
like steel The young girl leaned forward in her chair with an attention
so breathless a sympathy so quick and an admiration so artless
and unconscious that in an instant she divided with the speaker the
attention of the whole assemblage It was very hot the court was
crowded to suffocation even the open windows revealed a crowd of faces
outside the building eagerly following the Colonels words

He would remind the jury that only a few weeks ago he stood there as
the advocate of a powerful Company then represented by the present
defendant He spoke then as the champion of strict justice against
legal oppression no less should he today champion the cause of the
unprotected and the comparatively defenselesssave for that paramount
power which surrounds beauty and innocenceeven though the plaintiff
of yesterday was the defendant of today As he approached the court a
moment ago he had raised his eyes and beheld the starry flag flying from
its dome and he knew that glorious banner was a symbol of the perfect
equality under the Constitution of the rich and the poor the strong
and the weakan equality which made the simple citizen taken from the
plough in the field the pick in the gulch or from behind the counter
in the mining town who served on that jury the equal arbiters of
justice with that highest legal luminary whom they were proud to welcome
on the bench today The Colonel paused with a stately bow to the
impassive Judge It was this he continued which lifted his heart as
he approached the building And yethe had entered it with an
uncertainhe might almost saya timid step And why He knew
gentlemen he was about to confront a profoundaye a sacred
responsibility Those hymnbooks and holy writings handed to the jury
were NOT as his Honor had surmised for the purpose of enabling the
jury to indulge inerpreliminary choral exercise He might indeed
say Alas not They were the damning incontrovertible proofs of the
perfidy of the defendant And they would prove as terrible a warning to
him as the fatal characters upon Belshazzars wall There was a strong
sensation Hotchkiss turned a sallow green His lawyers assumed a
careless smile

It was his duty to tell them that this was not one of those ordinary
breachofpromise cases which were too often the occasion of ruthless
mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom The jury would find
nothing of that here There were no loveletters with the epithets of
endearment nor those mystic crosses and ciphers which he had been
credibly informed chastely hid the exchange of those mutual caresses
known as kisses There was no cruel tearing of the veil from those
sacred privacies of the human affection there was no forensic shouting
out of those fond confidences meant only for ONE But there was he was
shocked to say a new sacrilegious intrusion The weak pipings of Cupid
were mingled with the chorus of the saintsthe sanctity of the temple
known as the meetinghouse was desecrated by proceedings more in
keeping with the shrine of Venus and the inspired writings themselves
were used as the medium of amatory and wanton flirtation by the
defendant in his sacred capacity as deacon

The Colonel artistically paused after this thunderous denunciation The
jury turned eagerly to the leaves of the hymnbooks but the larger gaze
of the audience remained fixed upon the speaker and the girl who sat in
rapt admiration of his periods After the hush the Colonel continued
in a lower and sadder voice There are perhaps few of us here
gentlemenwith the exception of the defendantwho can arrogate to
themselves the title of regular churchgoers or to whom these humbler
functions of the prayermeeting the Sundayschool and the Bibleclass
are habitually familiar Yetmore solemnlydown in our hearts is the
deep conviction of our shortcomings and failings and a laudable desire
that others at least should profit by the teachings we neglect
Perhaps he continued closing his eyes dreamily there is not a
man here who does not recall the happy days of his boyhood the rustic
village spire the lessons shared with some artless village maiden with
whom he later sauntered hand in hand through the woods as the simple
rhyme rose upon their lips

 Always make it a point to have it a rule
 Never to be late at the Sabbathschool

He would recall the strawberry feasts the welcome annual picnic
redolent with hunks of gingerbread and sarsaparilla How would they feel
to know that these sacred recollections were now forever profaned in
their memory by the knowledge that the defendant was capable of using
such occasions to make love to the larger girls and teachers whilst
his artless companions were innocentlythe Court will pardon me for
introducing what I am credibly informed is the local expressiondoing
gooseberry The tremulous flicker of a smile passed over the faces of
the listening crowd and the Colonel slightly winced But he recovered
himself instantly and continued

My client the only daughter of a widowed motherwho has for years
stemmed the varying tides of adversity in the western precincts of this
townstands before you today invested only in her own innocence She
wears noerrich gifts of her faithless admireris panoplied in no
jewels rings nor mementos of affection such as lovers delight to hang
upon the shrine of their affections hers is not the glory with which
Solomon decorated the Queen of Sheba though the defendant as I shall
show later clothed her in the less expensive flowers of the kings
poetry No gentlemen The defendant exhibited in this affair a certain
frugality oferpecuniary investment which I am willing to admit may
be commendable in his class His only gift was characteristic alike
of his methods and his economy There is I understand a certain
not unimportant feature of religious exercise known as taking a
collection The defendant on this occasion by the mute presentation
of a tin plate covered with baize solicited the pecuniary contributions
of the faithful On approaching the plaintiff however he himself
slipped a lovetoken upon the plate and pushed it towards her That
lovetoken was a lozengea small disk I have reason to believe
concocted of peppermint and sugar bearing upon its reverse surface the
simple words I love you I have since ascertained that these disks
may be bought for five cents a dozenor at considerably less than one
half cent for the single lozenge Yes gentlemen the words I love
youthe oldest legend of all the refrain when the morning
stars sang togetherwere presented to the plaintiff by a medium so
insignificant that there is happily no coin in the republic low enough
to represent its value

I shall prove to you gentlemen of the jury said the Colonel
solemnly drawing a Bible from his coattail pocket that the defendant
for the last twelve months conducted an amatory correspondence with
the plaintiff by means of underlined words of Sacred Writ and church
psalmody such as beloved precious and dearest occasionally
appropriating whole passages which seemed apposite to his tender
passion I shall call your attention to one of them The defendant
while professing to be a total abstainera man who in my own
knowledge has refused spirituous refreshment as an inordinate weakness
of the fleshwith shameless hypocrisy underscores with his pencil the
following passage and presents it to the plaintiff The gentlemen of
the jury will find it in the Song of Solomon page 548 chapter ii
verse 5 After a pause in which the rapid rustling of leaves was heard
in the jurybox Colonel Starbottle declaimed in a pleading stentorian
voice Stay me witherFLAGONS comfort me witherapplesfor
I amersick of love Yes gentlemenyes you may well turn
from those accusing pages and look at the doublefaced defendant He
desirestoerbestayed with flagons I am not aware at present
what kind of liquor is habitually dispensed at these meetings and for
which the defendant so urgently clamored but it will be my duty before
this trial is over to discover it if I have to summon every barkeeper
in this district For the moment I will simply call your attention to
the QUANTITY It is not a single drink that the defendant asks fornot
a glass of light and generous wine to be shared with his inamorata
but a number of flagons or vessels each possibly holding a pint
measureFOR HIMSELF

The smile of the audience had become a laugh The Judge looked up
warningly when his eye caught the fact that the Colonel had again
winced at this mirth He regarded him seriously Mr Hotchkisss counsel
had joined in the laugh affectedly but Hotchkiss himself sat ashy pale
There was also a commotion in the jurybox a hurried turning over of
leaves and an excited discussion

The gentlemen of the jury said the Judge with official gravity
will please keep order and attend only to the speeches of counsel Any
discussion HERE is irregular and premature and must be reserved for the
juryroom after they have retired

The foreman of the jury struggled to his feet He was a powerful man
with a goodhumored face and in spite of his unfelicitous nickname of
The BoneBreaker had a kindly simple but somewhat emotional nature
Nevertheless it appeared as if he were laboring under some powerful
indignation

Can we ask a question Judge he said respectfully although his voice
had the unmistakable Western American ring in it as of one who was
unconscious that he could be addressing any but his peers

Yes said the Judge goodhumoredly

Were finding in this yere piece out o which the Kernel hes just bin
aquotin some language that me and my pardners allow hadnt orter be
read out afore a young lady in court and we want to know of youez a
farminded and impartial manef this is the reglar kind o book given
to gals and babies down at the meetinhouse

The jury will please follow the counsels speech without comment said
the Judge briefly fully aware that the defendants counsel would spring
to his feet as he did promptly

The Court will allow us to explain to the gentlemen that the language
they seem to object to has been accepted by the best theologians for
the last thousand years as being purely mystic As I will explain later
those are merely symbols of the Church

Of wot interrupted the foreman in deep scorn

Of the Church

We aint askin any questions o YOU and we aint takin any answers
said the foreman sitting down abruptly

I must insist said the Judge sternly that the plaintiffs counsel
be allowed to continue his opening without interruption You to
defendants counsel will have your opportunity to reply later

The counsel sank down in his seat with the bitter conviction that the
jury was manifestly against him and the case as good as lost But his
face was scarcely as disturbed as his clients who in great agitation
had begun to argue with him wildly and was apparently pressing some
point against the lawyers vehement opposal The Colonels murky eyes
brightened as he still stood erect with his hand thrust in his breast

It will be put to you gentlemen when the counsel on the other side
refrains from mere interruption and confines himself to reply that my
unfortunate client has no actionno remedy at lawbecause there were
no spoken words of endearment But gentlemen it will depend upon YOU
to say what are and what are not articulate expressions of love We all
know that among the lower animals with whom you may possibly be called
upon to classify the defendant there are certain signals more or less
harmonious as the case may be The ass brays the horse neighs the
sheep bleatsthe feathered denizens of the grove call to their mates
in more musical roundelays These are recognized facts gentlemen which
you yourselves as dwellers among nature in this beautiful land are all
cognizant of They are facts that no one would denyand we should have
a poor opinion of the ass who atersuch a supreme moment
would attempt to suggest that his call was unthinking and without
significance But gentlemen I shall prove to you that such was the
foolish selfconvicting custom of the defendant With the greatest
reluctance and theergreatest pain I succeeded in wresting from
the maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent confession that
the defendant had induced her to correspond with him in these methods
Picture to yourself gentlemen the lonely moonlight road beside the
widows humble cottage It is a beautiful night sanctified to the
affections and the innocent girl is leaning from her casement
Presently there appears upon the road a slinking stealthy figure the
defendant on his way to church True to the instruction she has received
from him her lips part in the musical utterance the Colonel lowered
his voice in a faint falsetto presumably in fond imitation of his
fair client Keeree Instantly the night becomes resonant with the
impassioned reply the Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian
tones Keerow Again as he passes rises the soft Keeree again
as his form is lost in the distance comes back the deep Keerow

A burst of laughter long loud and irrepressible struck the whole
courtroom and before the Judge could lift his halfcomposed face
and take his handkerchief from his mouth a faint Keeree from some
unrecognized obscurity of the courtroom was followed by a loud Keerow
from some opposite locality The Sheriff will clear the court said
the Judge sternly but alas as the embarrassed and choking officials
rushed hither and thither a soft Keeree from the spectators at
the window OUTSIDE the courthouse was answered by a loud chorus of
Keerows from the opposite windows filled with onlookers Again
the laughter arose everywhereeven the fair plaintiff herself sat
convulsed behind her handkerchief

The figure of Colonel Starbottle alone remained erectwhite and rigid
And then the Judge looking up sawwhat no one else in the court had
seenthat the Colonel was sincere and in earnest that what he had
conceived to be the pleaders most perfect acting and most elaborate
irony were the deep serious mirthless CONVICTIONS of a man without the
least sense of humor There was the respect of this conviction in
the Judges voice as he said to him gently You may proceed Colonel
Starbottle

I thank your Honor said the Colonel slowly for recognizing and
doing all in your power to prevent an interruption that during my
thirty years experience at the bar I have never been subjected
to without the privilege of holding the instigators thereof
responsiblePERSONALLY responsible It is possibly my fault that I have
failed oratorically to convey to the gentlemen of the jury the full
force and significance of the defendants signals I am aware that my
voice is singularly deficient in producing either the dulcet tones of my
fair client or the impassioned vehemence of the defendants response
I will continued the Colonel with a fatigued but blind fatuity that
ignored the hurriedly knit brows and warning eyes of the Judge try
again The note uttered by my client lowering his voice to the
faintest of falsettos was Keeree the response was Keerowow And
the Colonels voice fairly shook the dome above him

Another uproar of laughter followed this apparently audacious
repetition but was interrupted by an unlookedfor incident The
defendant rose abruptly and tearing himself away from the withholding
hand and pleading protestations of his counsel absolutely fled from
the courtroom his appearance outside being recognized by a prolonged
Keerow from the bystanders which again and again followed him in the
distance

In the momentary silence which followed the Colonels voice was heard
saying We rest here your Honor and he sat down No less white but
more agitated was the face of the defendants counsel who instantly
rose

For some unexplained reason your Honor my client desires to suspend
further proceedings with a view to effect a peaceable compromise with
the plaintiff As he is a man of wealth and position he is able and
willing to pay liberally for that privilege While I as his counsel am
still convinced of his legal irresponsibility as he has chosen publicly
to abandon his rights here I can only ask your Honors permission to
suspend further proceedings until I can confer with Colonel Starbottle

As far as I can follow the pleadings said the Judge gravely the
case seems to be hardly one for litigation and I approve of the
defendants course while I strongly urge the plaintiff to accept it

Colonel Starbottle bent over his fair client Presently he rose
unchanged in look or demeanor I yield your Honor to the wishes of my
client anderlady We accept

Before the court adjourned that day it was known throughout the town
that Adoniram K Hotchkiss had compromised the suit for four thousand
dollars and costs

Colonel Starbottle had so far recovered his equanimity as to strut
jauntily towards his office where he was to meet his fair client He
was surprised however to find her already there and in company with a
somewhat sheepishlooking young mana stranger If the Colonel had
any disappointment in meeting a third party to the interview his
oldfashioned courtesy did not permit him to show it He bowed
graciously and politely motioned them each to a seat

I reckoned Id bring Hiram round with me said the young lady lifting
her searching eyes after a pause to the Colonels though he WAS
awful shy and allowed that you didnt know him from Adam or even
suspect his existence But I said Thats just where you slip up
Hiram a powful man like the Colonel knows everythingand Ive seen it
in his eye Lordy she continued with a laugh leaning forward over
her parasol as her eyes again sought the Colonels dont you remember
when you asked me if I loved that old Hotchkiss and I told you Thats
tellin and you looked at meLordy I knew THEN you suspected there
was a Hiram SOMEWHERE as good as if Id told you Now you jest get up
Hiram and give the Colonel a good handshake For if it wasnt for HIM
and HIS searchin ways and HIS awful power of language I wouldnt hev
got that four thousand dollars out o that flirty fool Hotchkissenough
to buy a farm so as you and me could get married Thats what you owe
to HIM Dont stand there like a stuck fool starin at him He wont eat
youthough hes killed many a better man Come have I got to do ALL
the kissin

It is of record that the Colonel bowed so courteously and so profoundly
that he managed not merely to evade the proffered hand of the shy Hiram
but to only lightly touch the franker and more impulsive fingertips of
the gentle Zaidee Ieroffer my sincerest congratulationsthough
I think youeroverestimatemyerpowers of penetration
Unfortunately a pressing engagement which may oblige me also to leave
town tonight forbids my saying more I haveerleft theerbusiness
settlement of thisercase in the hands of the lawyers who do my
office work and who will show you every attention And now let me wish
you a very good afternoon

Nevertheless the Colonel returned to his private room and it was
nearly twilight when the faithful Jim entered to find him sitting
meditatively before his desk Fo God Kernel I hope dey aint nuffin
de matter but yous lookin mighty solemn I aint seen you look dat
way Kernel since de day pooh Massa Stryker was fetched home shot froo
de head

Hand me down the whiskey Jim said the Colonel rising slowly

The negro flew to the closet joyfully and brought out the bottle
The Colonel poured out a glass of the spirit and drank it with his old
deliberation

Youre quite right Jim he said putting down his glass but
Imergetting oldandsomehow I am missing poor Stryker damnably




THE LANDLORD OF THE BIG FLUME HOTEL


The Big Flume stagecoach had just drawn up at the Big Flume Hotel
simultaneously with the ringing of a large dinner bell in the two hands
of a negro waiter who by certain gyrations of the bell was trying to
impart to his performance that picturesque elegance and harmony
which the instrument and its purpose lacked For the refreshment thus
proclaimed was only the ordinary station dinner protracted at Big
Flume for three quarters of an hour to allow for the arrival of the
connecting mail from Sacramento although the repast was of a nature
that seldom prevailed upon the traveler to linger the full period over
its details The ordinary cravings of hunger were generally satisfied in
half an hour and the remaining minutes were employed by the passengers
in drowning the memory of their meal in drinks at the bar in smoking
and even in a hurried game of old sledge or dominoes Yet today
the deserted table was still occupied by a belated traveler and a
ladyseparated by a wilderness of empty disheswho had arrived after
the stagecoach Observing which the landlord perhaps touched by
this unwonted appreciation of his fare moved forward to give them his
personal attention

He was a man however who seemed to be singularly deficient in those
supreme qualities which in the West have exalted the ability to keep a
hotel into a proverbial synonym for superexcellence He had little or
no innovating genius no trade devices no assumption no faculty for
advertisement no progressiveness and no racket He had the tolerant
goodhumor of the Southwestern pioneer to whom cyclones famine
drought floods pestilence and savages were things to be accepted
and whom disaster if it did not stimulate certainly did not appall He
received the insults complaints and criticisms of hurried and hungry
passengers the comments and threats of the Stage Company as he had
submitted to the aggressions of a stupid unjust but overruling
Naturewith unshaken calm Perhaps herein lay his strength People
were obliged to submit to him and his hotel as part of the unfinished
civilization and they even saw something humorous in his impassiveness
Those who preferred to remonstrate with him emerged from the discussion
with the general feeling of having been played with by a largehearted
and paternally disposed bear Tall and longlimbed with much strength
in his lazy muscles there was also a prevailing impression that this
feeling might be intensified if the discussion were ever carried to
physical contention Of his personal history it was known only that he
had emigrated from Wisconsin in 1852 that he had calmly unyoked his ox
teams at Big Flume then a trackless wilderness and on the opening of a
wagon road to the new mines had built a wayside station which eventually
developed into the present hotel He had been divorced in a Western
State by his wife Rosalie locally known as The Prairie Flower of
Elkham Creek for incompatibility of temper Her temper was not stated

Such was Abner Langworthy the proprietor as he moved leisurely down
towards the lady guest who was nearest and who was sitting with her
back to the passage between the tables Stopping occasionally to
professionally adjust the tablecloths and glasses he at last reached
her side

Ef theres anythin more ye want that ye aint seein maam he
beganand stopped suddenly For the lady had looked up at the sound of
his voice It was his divorced wife whom he had not seen since their
separation The recognition was instantaneous mutual and characterized
by perfect equanimity on both sides

Well I wanter know said the lady although the exclamation point was
purely conventional Abner Langworthy though perhaps Ive no call to
say Abner

Same to you Rosaliethough I say it too returned the landlord But
hol on just a minit He moved forward to the other guest put the same
perfunctory question regarding his needs received a negative answer
and then returned to the lady and dropped into a chair opposite to her

Youre looking peart andfleshy he said resignedly as if he were
tolerating his own conventional politeness with his other difficulties
unless he added cautiously youre takin on some new disease

No Im fairly comfble responded the lady calmly and youre
gettin on in the vale ez is naturalthough you still kind o run to
bone as you used

There was not a trace of malevolence in either of their comments only
a resigned recognition of certain unpleasant truths which seemed to have
been habitual to both of them Mr Langworthy paused to flick away some
flies from the butter with his professional napkin and resumed

It must be a matter o five years sens I last saw ye isnt itin
court arter you got the decreeyou remember

Yesthe 28th o July 51 I paid Lawyer Hoskinss bill that very
daythats how I remember returned the lady Youve got a big
business here she continued glancing round the room I reckon youre
makin it pay Dont seem to be in your line though but then thar
wasnt many things that was

Nothats so responded Mr Langworthy nodding his head as
assenting to an undeniable proposition and youI suppose youre
gettin on too I reckon youreermarriedehwith a slight
suggestion of putting the question delicately

The lady nodded ignoring the hesitation Yes let me see its just
three years and three days Constantine ByersI dont reckon you know
himfrom Milwaukee Timber merchant Standin timbers his specialty

And I reckon hessatisfactory

Yes Mr Byers is a good providerand handy And you I should say
youd want a wife in this business

Mr Langworthys serious halfperfunctory manner here took on an
appearance of interest YesIve bin thinkin that way Thars a young
woman helpin in the kitchen ez might do though Im not certain and
I aint lettin on anything as yet You might take a look at her
RosalieI orter say Mrs Byers ez isand kinder size her up and
gimme the result Its still wantin seven minutes o schedule time
afore the stage goes andif you aint wantin more fooddelicately
as became a landlordand aint got anythin else to do it might pass
the time

Strange as it may seem Mrs Byers here displayed an equal animation in
her fresh face as she rose promptly to her feet and began to rearrange
her dust cloak around her buxom figure I dont mind Abner she
said and I dont think that Mr Byers would mind either then seeing
Langworthy hesitating at the latter unexpected suggestion she added
confidently and I wouldnt mind even if he did for Im sure if I
dont know the kind o woman youd be likely to need I dont know who
would Only last week I was sayin like that to Mr Byers

To Mr Byers said Abner with some surprise

Yesto him I said Weve been married three years Constantine and
ef I dont know by this time what kind o woman you need nowand might
need in futurewhy thar aint much use in matrimony

You was always wise Rosalie said Abner with reminiscent
appreciation

I was always there Abner returned Mrs Byers with a complacent show
of dimples which she however chastened into that resignation which
seemed characteristic of the pair Lets see your intendedas might
be

Thus supported Mr Langworthy led Mrs Byers into the hall through a
crowd of loungers into a smaller hall and there opened the door of the
kitchen It was a large room whose windows were half darkened by the
encompassing pines which still pressed around the house on the scantily
cleared site A number of men and women among them a Chinaman and a
negro were engaged in washing dishes and other culinary duties and
beside the window stood a young blonde girl who was wiping a tin pan
which she was also using to hide a burst of laughter evidently caused by
the abrupt entrance of her employer A quantity of fluffy hair and part
of a white bared arm were nevertheless visible outside the disk
and Mrs Byers gathered from the direction of Mr Langworthys eyes
assisted by a slight nudge from his elbow that this was the selected
fair one His feeble explanatory introduction addressed to the
occupants generally Just showing the house to MrserDusenberry
convinced her that the circumstances of his having been divorced he had
not yet confided to the young woman As he turned almost immediately
away Mrs Byers in following him managed to get a better look at the
girl as she was exchanging some facetious remark to a neighbor Mr
Langworthy did not speak until they had reached the deserted diningroom
again

Well he said briefly glancing at the clock what did ye think o
Mary Ellen

To any ordinary observer the girl in question would have seemed the
least fitted in age sobriety of deportment and administrative capacity
to fill the situation thus proposed for her but Mrs Byers was not an
ordinary observer and her auditor was not an ordinary listener

Shes older than she gives herself out to be said Mrs Byers
tentatively and them kitten ways dont amount to much

Mr Langworthy nodded Had Mrs Byers discovered a homicidal tendency in
Mary Ellen he would have been equally unmoved

She dont handsome much continued Mrs Byers musingly but

I never was keen on good looks in a woman Rosalie You know that
Mrs Byers received the equivocal remark unemotionally and returned to
the subject

Well she said contemplatively I should think you could make her
suit

Mr Langworthy nodded with resigned toleration of all that might have
influenced her judgment and his own I was wantin a farminded
opinion Rosalie and you happened along jest in time Kin I put up
anythin in the way of food for ye he added as a stir outside and the
words All aboard proclaimed the departing of the stagecoachan
orange or a hunk o gingerbread freshly baked

Thank ye kindly Abner but I shant be usin anythin afore supper
responded Mrs Byers as they passed out into the veranda beside the
waiting coach

Mr Langworthy helped her to her seat Ef youre passin this way
aginhe hesitated delicately

Ill drop in or I reckon Mr Byers might he havin business along the
road returned Mrs Byers with a cheerful nod as the coach rolled away
and the landlord of the Big Flume Hotel reentered his house

For the next three weeks however it did not appear that Mr Langworthy
was in any hurry to act upon the advice of his former wife His
relations to Mary Ellen Budd were characterized by his usual tolerance
to his employees failingswhich in Mary Ellens case included many
breakagesbut were not marked by the invasion of any warmer feeling
or a desire for confidences The only perceptible divergence from his
regular habits was a disposition to be on the veranda at the arrival of
the stagecoach and when his duties permitted this a cautious survey
of his female guests at the beginning of dinner This probably led to
his more or less ignoring any peculiarities in his masculine patrons or
their claims to his personal attention Particularly so in the case of
a redbearded man in a long linen duster both heavily freighted with
the red dust of the stage road which seemed to have invaded his very
eyes as he watched the landlord closely Towards the close of the
dinner when Abner accompanied by a negro waiter after his usual
custom passed down each side of the long table collecting payment for
the meal the stranger looked up You air the landlord of this hotel I
reckon

I am said Abner tolerantly

Id like a word or two with ye

But Abner had been obliged to have a formula for such occasions Yell
pay for yer dinner first he said submissively but firmly and make
yer remarks agin the food arter

The stranger flushed quickly and his eye took an additional shade of
red but meeting Abners serious gray ones he contented himself with
ostentatiously taking out a handful of gold and silver and paying his
bill Abner passed on but after dinner was over he found the stranger
in the hall

Ye pulled me up rather short in thar said the man gloomily but its
just as well as the talk I was wantin with ye was kinder betwixt and
between ourselves and not hotel business My names Byers and my wife
let on she met ye down here

For the first time it struck Abner as incongruous that another man
should call Rosalie his wife although the fact of her remarriage
had been made sufficiently plain to him He accepted it as he would an
earthquake or any other dislocation with his usual tolerant smile and
held out his hand

Mr Byers took it seemingly mollified and yet inwardly
disturbedmore even than was customary in Abners guests after dinner

Have a drink with me he suggested although it had struck him that
Mr Byers had been drinking before dinner

Im agreeable responded Byers promptly but with a glance at the
crowded barroom couldnt we go somewhere jest you and me and have a
quiet confab

I reckon But ye must wait till we get her off

Mr Byers started slightly but it appeared that the impedimental sex in
this case was the coach which after a slight feminine hesitation was
at last started Whereupon Mr Langworthy followed by a negro with a
tray bearing a decanter and glasses grasped Mr Byerss arm and walked
along a small side veranda the depth of the house stepped off and
apparently plunged with his guest into the primeval wilderness

It has already been indicated that the site of the Big Flume Hotel had
been scantily cleared but Mr Byers backwoodsman though he was was
quite unprepared for so abrupt a change The hotel with its noisy crowd
and garish newness although scarcely a dozen yards away seemed lost
completely to sight and sound A slight fringe of old tin cans broken
china shavings and even of the longdried chips of the felled trees
once crossed the two men were alone From the tray deposited at the
foot of an enormous pine they took the decanter filled their glasses
and then disposed of themselves comfortably against a spreading root
The curling tail of a squirrel disappeared behind them the faroff tap
of a woodpecker accented the loneliness And then almost magically as
it seemed the thin veneering of civilization on the two men seemed to
be cast off like the bark of the trees around them and they lounged
before each other in aboriginal freedom Mr Byers removed his
restraining duster and undercoat Mr Langworthy resigned his dirty
white jacket his collar and unloosed a suspender with which he
played

Would it be a fair question between two farminded men ez hez lived
alone said Mr Byers with a gravity so supernatural that it could be
referred only to liquor to ask ye in what sort o way did Mrs Byers
show her temper

Show her temper echoed Abner vacantly

Yesin course I mean when you and Mrs Byers waswasone You know
the divorce was for incompatibility of temper

But she got the divorce from me so I reckon I had the temper said
Langworthy with great simplicity

Whaat said Mr Byers putting down his glass and gazing with drunken
gravity at the sadeyed yet goodhumoredly tolerant man before him
Youyou had the temper

I reckon thats what the court allowed said Abner simply

Mr Byers stared Then after a moments pause he nodded with a
significant yet relieved face Yes I see in course Times when youd
histed too much o this corn juice lifting up his glass inside
yeye sorter bust out ravin

But Abner shook his head I wuz a total abstainer in them days he
said quietly

Mr Byers got unsteadily on his legs and looked around him Wot might
hev bin the general gait o your temper pardner he said in a hoarse
whisper

Dont know I reckon thats jest whar the incompatibility kem in

And when she hove plates at your head wot did you do

She didnt hove no plates said Abner gravely did she say she did

No no returned Byers hastily in crimson confusion I kinder got
it mixed with suthin else He waved his hand in a lordly way as if
dismissing the subject Howsumever you and her is off anyway he
added with badly concealed anxiety

I reckon theres the decree returned Abner with his usual resigned
acceptance of the fact

Mrs Byers wuz allowin ye wuz thinkin of a second Hows that comin
on

Jest whar it was returned Abner I aint doin anything yet Ye see
Ive got to tell the gal naterally that Im divorced And as that
isnt known hereabouts I dont keer to do so till Im pretty certain
And then in course Ive got to

Why hev ye got to asked Byers abruptly

Because it wouldnt be on the square with the girl said Abner How
would you like it if Mrs Byers had never told you shed been married to
me And spose youd happen to hev bin a divorced man and hadnt told
her eh Well he continued sinking back resignedly against the tree
I aint sayin anythin but shed hev got another divorce and FROM
you on the spotyou bet

Well all I kin say is said Mr Byers lifting his voice excitedly
thatbut he stopped short and was about to fill his glass again from
the decanter when the hand of Abner stopped him

Yeve got ez much ez ye kin carry now Byers he said slowly and
thats about ez much ez I allow a man to take in at the Big Flume Hotel
Treatin is treatin hospitality is hospitality ef you and me was
squattin out on the prairie Id let you fill your skin with that pizen
and wrap ye up in yer blankets afterwards But here at Big Flume the
Stage Kempenny and the wimen and children passengers hez their rights
He paused a moment and added And so I reckon hez Mrs Byers and I
aint goin to send you home to her outer my house blind drunk Its
mighty rough on you and me I know but theres a lot o roughness in
this world ez hez to be got over and life ez far ez I kin see aint
all a clearin

Perhaps it was his goodhumored yet firm determination perhaps it was
his resigned philosophy but something in the speakers manner affected
Mr Byerss alcoholic susceptibility and hastened his descent from the
passionate heights of intoxication to the maudlin stage whither he
was drifting The fire of his red eyes became filmed and dim an equal
moisture gathered in his throat as he pressed Abners hand with drunken
fervor Thash so your thinking o me an Mish Byersh is like troo
fren he said thickly I wosh only goin to shay that wotever Mish
Byersh wosheven if she wosh wife o yoursshe woshnoble woman Such
a woman continued Mr Byers dreamily regarding space cant have too
many husbands

You jest sit back here a minit and have a quiet smoke till I come
back said Abner handing him his tobacco plug Ive got to give the
butcher his orderbut I wont be a minit He secured the decanter as
he spoke and evading an apparent disposition of his companion to fall
upon his neck made his way with long strides to the hotel as Mr
Byers sinking back against the trees began certain futile efforts to
light his unfilled pipe

Whether Abners attendance on the butcher was merely an excuse to
withdraw with the decanter I cannot say He however dispatched his
business quickly and returned to the tree But to his surprise Mr
Byers was no longer there He explored the adjacent woodland with
nonsuccess and no reply to his shouting Annoyed but not alarmed as
it seemed probable that the missing man had fallen in a drunken sleep in
some hidden shadows he returned to the house when it occurred to him
that Byers might have sought the barroom for some liquor But he was
still more surprised when the barkeeper volunteered the information
that he had seen Mr Byers hurriedly pass down the side veranda into the
highroad An hour later this was corroborated by an arriving teamster
who had passed a man answering to the description of Byers mor n
half full staggeringly but hurriedly walking along the road two
miles back There seemed to be no doubt that the missing man had
taken himself off in a fit of indignation or of extreme thirst
Either hypothesis was disagreeable to Abner in his queer sense
of responsibility to Mrs Byers but he accepted it with his usual
goodhumored resignation

Yet it was difficult to conceive what connection this episode had in
his mind with his suspended attention to Mary Ellen or why it should
determine his purpose But he had a logic of his own and it seemed to
have demonstrated to him that he must propose to the girl at once
This was no easy matter however he had never shown her any previous
attention and her particular functions in the hotelthe charge of the
few bedrooms for transient guestsseldom brought him in contact with
her His interview would have to appear to be a business onewhich
however he wished to avoid from a delicate consciousness of its truth
While making up his mind for a few days he contented himself with
gravely regarding her in his usual resigned tolerant way whenever he
passed her Unfortunately the first effect of this was an audible giggle
from Mary Ellen later some confusion and anxiety in her manner and
finally a demeanor of resentment and defiance

This was so different from what he had expected that he was obliged
to precipitate matters The next day was Sundaya day on which his
employees in turns were allowed the recreation of being driven to Big
Flume City eight miles distant to church or for the days holiday
In the morning Mary Ellen was astonished by Abner informing her that he
designed giving her a separate holiday with himself It must be admitted
that the girl who was already prinked up for the enthrallment of the
youth of Big Flume City did not appear as delighted with the change of
plan as a more exacting lover would have liked Howbeit as soon as the
wagon had left with its occupants Abner in the unwonted disguise of
a full suit of black clothes turned to the girl and offering her his
arm gravely proceeded along the side veranda across the mound of debris
already described to the adjacent wilderness and the very trees under
which he and Byers had sat

Its about ez good a place for a little talk Miss Budd he said
pointing to a tree root ez ef we went a spell further and its handy
to the house And ef youll jest say what youd like outer the cupboard
or the barno matter whichIll fetch it to you

But Mary Ellen Budd seated herself sideways on the root with her furled
white parasol in her lap her skirts fastidiously tucked about her feet
and glancing at the fatuous Abner from under her stack of fluffy hair
and light eyelashes simply shook her head and said that she reckoned
she wasnt hankering much for anything that morning

Ive been calkilatin to myself Miss Budd said Abner resignedly
that when two folkslike ez you and memeet together to kinder
discuss things that might go so far ez to keep them together if they
hez had anything of that sort in their lives afore they ought to speak
of it confidentially like together

Ef any one o them sneakin soulless critters in the kitchen hez bin
slingin lies to ye about meor carryin tales broke in Mary Ellen
Budd setting every one of her thirtytwo strong white teeth together
with a snap wellye might hev told me so to oncet without spilin my
Sunday But ez fer yer keepin me a minit longer yeve only got to pay
me my salary today andbut here she stopped for the astonishment in
Abners face was too plain to be misunderstood

Nobodys been slinging any lies about ye Miss Budd he said slowly
recovering himself resignedly from this last backhanded stroke of fate
I warnt talkin o you but myself I was only allowin to say that I
was a divorced man

As a sudden flush came over Mary Ellens brownishwhite face while
she stared at him Abner hastened to delicately explain It wasnt
no onfaithfulness Miss Buddno philanderin o mine but only
incompatibility o temper

Temperyour temper gasped Mary Ellen

Yes said Abner

And here a sudden change came over Mary Ellens face and she burst into
a shriek of laughter She laughed with her hands slapping the sides of
her skirt she laughed with her hands clasping her narrow hollow waist
laughed with her head down on her knees and her fluffy hair tumbling
over it Abner was relieved and yet it seemed strange to him that this
revelation of his temper should provoke such manifest incredulity in
both Byers and Mary Ellen But perhaps these things would be made plain
to him hereafter at present they must be accepted in the days work
and tolerated

Your temper gurgled Mary Ellen Saints alive What kind o temper

Well I reckon returned Abner submissively and selecting a word
to give his meaning more comprehensionI reckon it was
kinderaggeravokin

Mary Ellen sniffed the air for a moment in speechless incredulity and
then locking her hands around her knees and bending forward said
Look here Ef that old woman o yours ever knew what temper was in a
man ef shes ever bin tied to a brute that treated her like a nigger
till she darent say her soul was her own who struck her with his
eyes and tongue when he hadnt anythin else handy who made her life
miserable when he was sober and a terror when he was drunk who at
last drove her away and then divorced her for desertionthenthen she
might talk But incompatibility o temper with you Oh go awayit
makes me sick

How far Abner was impressed with the truth of this how far it prompted
his next question nobody but Abner knew For he said deliberately I
was only goin to ask ye if knowin I was a divorced man ye would
mind marryin me

Mary Ellens face changed the evasive instincts of her sex rose up
Didnt I hear ye sayin suthin about refreshments she said archly
Mebbe you wouldnt mind gettin me a bottle o lemming sody outer the
bar

Abner got up at once perhaps not dismayed by this diversion and
departed for the refreshment As he passed along the side veranda the
recollection of Mr Byers and his mysterious flight occurred to him For
a wild moment he thought of imitating him But it was too late nowhe
had spoken Besides he had no wife to fly to and the thirsty or
indignant Byers hadhis wife Fate was indeed hard He returned with
the bottle of lemon soda on a tray and a resigned spirit equal to her
decrees Mary Ellen remarking that he had brought nothing for himself
archly insisted upon his sharing with her the bottle of soda and even
coquettishly touched his lips with her glass Abner smiled patiently

But here as if playfully exhilarated by the naughty foaming soda she
regarded him with her headand a good deal of her blonde hairvery
much on one side as she said Do you know that all along o you bein
so free with me in tellin your affairs I kinder feel like just telling
you mine

Dont said Abner promptly

Dont echoed Miss Budd

Dont repeated Abner Its nothing to me What I said about myself
is different for it might make some difference to you But nothing you
could say of yourself would make any change in me I stick to what I
said just now

But said Miss Buddin half real half simulated threateningwhat
if it had suthin to do with my answer to what you said just now

It couldnt So if its all the same to you Miss Budd Id rather ye
wouldnt

That said the lady still more archly lifting a playful finger is
your temper

Mebbe it is said Abner suddenly with a wondering sense of relief

It was however settled that Miss Budd should go to Sacramento to visit
her friends that Abner would join her later when their engagement
would be announced and that she should not return to the hotel until
they were married The compact was sealed by the interchange of a
friendly kiss from Miss Budd with a patient tolerating one from Abner
and then it suddenly occurred to them both that they might as well
return to their duties in the hotel which they did Miss Budds entire
outing that Sunday lasted only half an hour

A week elapsed Miss Budd was in Sacramento and the landlord of the Big
Flume Hotel was standing at his usual post in the doorway during dinner
when a waiter handed him a note It contained a single line scrawled in
pencil


Come out and see me behind the house as before I dussent come in on
account of her C BYERS


On account of her Abner cast a hurried glance around the tables
Certainly Mrs Byers was not there He walked in the hall and the
verandashe was not there He hastened to the rendezvous evidently
meant by the writer the wilderness behind the house Sure enough
Byers drunk and maudlin supporting himself by the tree root staggered
forward clasped him in his arms and murmured hoarsely

Shes gone

Gone echoed Abner with a whitening face Mrs Byers Where

Run away Never come back no more Gone

A vague idea that had been in Abners mind since Byerss last visit now
took awful shape Before the unfortunate Byers could collect his senses
he felt himself seized in a giants grasp and forced against the tree

You coward said all that was left of the tolerant Abnerhis even
voiceyou hound Did you dare to abuse her to lay your vile hands on
herto strike her Answer me

The shockthe graspperhaps Abners words momentarily silenced Byers
Did I strike her he said dazedly did I abuse her Oh yes with
deep irony Certainly In course Look yer pardnerhe suddenly
dragged up his sleeve from his red hairy arm exposing a blue cicatrix
in its centrethats a jab from her scissors about three months ago
look yerhe bent his head and showed a scar along the scalpthats
her playfulness with a fire shovel Look yerhe quickly opened his
collar where his neck and cheek were striped and crossed with adhesive
plasterthats all that was left o a glass jar o preservesthe
preserves got away but some of the glass got stuck Thats when she
heard I was a divorced man and hadnt told her

Were you a divorced man gasped Abner

You know that in course I was said Byers scornfully dye meanter
say she didnt tell ye

She echoed Abner vaguely Your wifeyou said just now she didnt
know it before

My wife ez oncet was I mean Mary Ellenyour wife ez is to be said
Byers with deep irony Oh come now Pretend ye dont know Hi there
Hands off Dont strike a man when hes down like I am

But Abners clutch of Byerss shoulder relaxed and he sank down to a
sitting posture on the root In the meantime Byers overcome by a sense
of this new misery added to his manifold grievances gave way to maudlin
silent tears

Mary Ellenyour first wife repeated Abner vacantly

Yesh said Byers thickly my first wifeshelected and picked out
fer your shecond wifeby your firstlike dd conundrum How wash I
tknow he said with a sudden shriek of public expostulationthash
what I wanter know Here I come to talk with fren like man to man
unshuspecting innoshent as chile about my shecond wife Fren drops
out carryin off the whiskey Then I hear all o suddent voice o
Mary Ellen talkin in kitchen then I come round softly and see Mary
Ellenmy wife as useter bestandin at frens kitchen winder Then I
lights out quicker n lightnin and scoots And when I gets back home
I ups and tells my wife And whosh fault isht Who shaid a man oughter
tell hish wife You Who keepsh other mensh first wivesh at kishen
winder to frighten em to tell You

But a change had already come over the face of Abner Langworthy The
anger anxiety astonishment and vacuity that was there had vanished
and he looked up with his usual resigned acceptance of the inevitable
as he said I reckon thats so And seein its so with goodnatured
tolerance he added I reckon Ill break rules for oncet and stand ye
another drink

He stood another drink and yet another and eventually put the doubly
widowed Byers to bed in his own room These were but details of a larger
tribulationand yet he knew instinctively that his cup was not yet
full The further drop of bitterness came a few days later in a line
from Mary Ellen I neednt tell you that all betwixt you and me is off
and you kin tell your old woman that her selection for a second wife
for you wuz about as bad as your own first selection Ye kin tell Mr
Byersyer great friend whom ye never let on ye knewthat when I want
another husband I shant take the trouble to ask him to fish one out for
me It would be kindbut confusin

He never heard from her again Mr Byers was duly notified that Mrs
Byers had commenced action for divorce in another state in which
concealment of a previous divorce invalidated the marriage but he did
not respond The two men became great friendsand assured celibates
Yet they always spoke reverently of their wife with the touching
prefix of our

She was a good woman pardner said Byers

And she understood us said Abner resignedly

Perhaps she had




A BUCKEYE HOLLOW INHERITANCE


The four men on the Zip Coon Ledge had not got fairly settled to their
mornings work There was the usual lingering hesitation which is apt to
attend the takingup of any regular or monotonous performance shown in
this instance in the prolonged scrutiny of a picks point the solemn
selection of a shovel or the hefting or weighing of a tappingiron or
drill One member becoming interested in a funny paragraph he found in
the scrap of newspaper wrapped around his noonday cheese shamelessly
sat down to finish it regardless of the prospecting pan thrown at him
by another They had taken up their daily routine of mining life like
schoolboys at their tasks

Hello said Ned Wyngate joyously recognizing a possible further
interruption Blamed if the Express rider aint comin here

He was shading his eyes with his hand as he gazed over the broad
sunbaked expanse of broken flat between them and the highroad They
all looked up and saw the figure of a mounted man with a couriers
bag thrown over his shoulder galloping towards them It was really
an event as their letters were usually left at the grocery at the
crossroads

I knew something was goin to happen said Wyngate I didnt feel a
bit like work this morning

Here one of their number ran off to meet the advancing horseman They
watched him until they saw the latter rein up and hand a brown envelope
to their messenger who ran breathlessly back with it to the Ledge as
the horseman galloped away again

A telegraph for Jackson Wells he said handing it to the young man
who had been reading the scrap of paper

There was a dead silence Telegrams were expensive rarities in those
days especially with the youthful Bohemian miners of the Zip Coon
Ledge They were burning with curiosity yet a singular thing happened
Accustomed as they had been to a life of brotherly familiarity and
unceremoniousness this portentous message from the outside world of
civilization recalled their old formal politeness They looked steadily
away from the receiver of the telegram and he on his part stammered an
apologetic Excuse me boys as he broke the envelope

There was another pause which seemed to be interminable to the waiting
partners Then the voice of Wells in quite natural tones said By
gum thats funny Read that Dexterread it out loud

Dexter Rice the foreman took the proffered telegram from Wellss hand
and read as follows


Your uncle Quincy Wells died yesterday leaving you sole heir Will
attend you tomorrow for instructions

BAKER AND TWIGGS

Attorneys Sacramento


The three miners faces lightened and turned joyously to Wells but HIS
face looked puzzled

May we congratulate you Mr Wells said Wyngate with affected
politeness or possibly your uncle may have been English and a title
goes with the prop and you may be Lord Wells or Very Wellsat
least

But here Jackson Wellss youthful face lost its perplexity and he began
to laugh long and silently to himself This was protracted to such an
extent that Dexter asserted himselfas foreman and senior partner

Look here Jack dont sit there cackling like a chuckleheaded magpie
if you ARE the heir

Icanthelp it gasped Jackson I am the heirbut you see boys
there AINT ANY PROPERTY

What do you mean Is all that a sell demanded Rice

Not much Telegraphs too expensive for that sort o feelin You see
boys Ive got an Uncle Quincy though I dont know him much and he MAY
be dead But his whole fixins consisted of a claim the size of ours
and played out long ago a ramshackle lot o sheds called a cottage and
a kind of market garden of about three acres where he reared and sold
vegetables He was always poor and as for calling it property and ME
the heirgood Lord

A miser as sure as youre born said Wyngate with optimistic
decision Thats always the way Youll find every crack of that
blessed old shed stuck full of greenbacks and certificates of deposit
and lots of gold dust and coin buried all over that cow patch And of
course no one suspected it And of course he lived alone and never let
any one get into his houseand nearly starved himself Lord love you
Theres hundreds of such cases The world is full of em

Thats so chimed in Pulaski Briggs the fourth partner and I tell
you what Jacksey well come over with you the day you take possession
and just prospect the whole blamed shanty pigsties and potato patch
for funand wont charge you anything

For a moment Jacksons face had really brightened under the infection of
enthusiasm but it presently settled into perplexity again

No You bet the boys around Buckeye Hollow would have spotted anything
like that long ago

Buckeye Hollow repeated Rice and his partners

Yes Buckeye Hollow thats the place not twenty miles from here and
a Godforsaken hole as you know

A cloud had settled on Zip Coon Ledge They knew of Buckeye Hollow and
it was evident that no good had ever yet come out of that Nazareth

Theres no use of talking now said Rice conclusively Youll draw it
all from that lawyer shark whos coming here tomorrow and you can bet
your life he wouldnt have taken this trouble if there wasnt suthin in
it Anyhow well knock off work now and call it half a day in honor
of our distinguished young friends accession to his baronial estates
of Buckeye Hollow Well just toddle down to Tomlinsons at the
crossroads and have a nip and a quiet game of old sledge at Jackseys
expense I reckon the estates good for THAT he added with severe
gravity And speaking as a farminded man and the president of
this yer Company if Jackson would occasionally take out and air that
telegraphic dispatch of his while were at Tomlinsons it might do
something for that Companys creditwith Tomlinson Were wantin some
new blastin plant bad

Oddly enough the telegramaccidentally shown at Tomlinsonsproduced a
gratifying effect and the Zip Coon Ledge materially advanced in
public estimation With this possible infusion of new capital into its
resources the Company was beset by offers of machinery and goods
and it was deemed expedient by the sapient Rice that to prevent the
dissemination of any more accurate information regarding Jacksons
property the next day the lawyer should be met at the stage office by
one of the members and conveyed secretly past Tomlinsons to the Ledge

Id let you go he said to Jackson only it wont do for that dd
skunk of a lawyer to think youre too anxioussabe We want to rub into
him that we are in the habit out yer of havin things left to us and
a fortin more or less falling into us now and then aint nothin
alongside of the Zip Coon claim It wont hurt ye to keep up a big bluff
on that hand of yours Nobody would dare to call you

Indeed this idea was carried out with such elaboration the next day that
Mr Twiggs the attorney was considerably impressed both by the conduct
of his guide who although burning with curiosity expressed absolute
indifference regarding Jackson Wellss inheritance and the calmness of
Jackson himself who had to be ostentatiously called from his work on
the Ledge to meet him and who even gave him an audience in the hearing
of his partners Forced into an apologetic attitude he expressed his
regret at being obliged to bother Mr Wells with an affair of such
secondary importance but he was obliged to carry out the formalities of
the law

What do you suppose the estate is worth asked Wells carelessly

I should not think that the house the claim and the land would bring
more than fifteen hundred dollars replied Twiggs submissively

To the impecunious owners of Zip Coon Ledge it seemed a large sum but
they did not show it

You see continued Mr Twiggs its really a case of willing away
property from its obvious or direct inheritors instead of a beneficial
grant I take it that you and your uncle were not particularly
intimateat least so I gathered when I made the willand his simple
object was to disinherit his only daughter with whom he had had some
quarrel and who had left him to live with his late wifes brother Mr
Morley Brown who is quite wealthy and residing in the same township
Perhaps you remember the young lady

Jackson Wells had a dim recollection of this cousin a hateful
redhaired schoolgirl and an equally unpleasant memory of this other
uncle who was purseproud and had never taken any notice of him He
answered affirmatively

There may be some attempt to contest the will continued Mr Twiggs
as the disinheriting of an only child and a daughter offends the
sentiment of the people and of judges and jury and the law makes such
a will invalid unless a reason is given Fortunately your uncle has
placed his reasons on record I have a copy of the will here and can
show you the clause He took it from his pocket and read as follows
I exclude my daughter Jocelinda Wells from any benefit or provision
of this my will and testament for the reason that she has voluntarily
abandoned her fathers roof for the house of her mothers brother
Morley Brown has preferred the fleshpots of Egypt to the virtuous
frugalities of her own home and has discarded the humble friends of
her youth and the associates of her father for the meretricious
and slavish sympathy of wealth and position In lieu thereof and as
compensation therefor I do hereby give and bequeath to her my full and
free permission to gratify her frequently expressed wish for another
guardian in place of myself and to become the adopted daughter of the
said Morley Brown with the privilege of assuming the name of Brown
as aforesaid You see he continued as the young ladys present
position is a better one than it would be if she were in her fathers
house and was evidently a compromise the sentimental consideration of
her being left homeless and penniless falls to the ground However as
the inheritance is small and might be of little account to you if you
choose to waive it I dare say we may make some arrangement

This was an utterly unexpected idea to the Zip Coon Company and
Jackson Wells was for a moment silent But Dexter Rice was equal to the
emergency and turned to the astonished lawyer with severe dignity

Youll excuse me for interferin but as the senior partner of this
yer Ledge and Jackson Wells yer bein a most important member what
affects his usefulness on this claim affects us And we propose to carry
out this yer will with all its dips and spurs and angles

As the surprised Twiggs turned from one to the other Rice continued
Ez far as we kin understand this little game its the just punishment
of a highflying girl as breaks her pore old fathers heart and the
reward of a young feller ez has bin to our knowledge ez devoted a
nephew as they make em Time and time again sittin around our camp
fire at night weve heard Jacksey saykinder to himself and kinder
to us Now I wonder whats gone o old uncle Quincy and he never
sat down to a square meal or ever rose from a square game but what
he allus said If old uncle Quince was only here now boys Id die
happy I leave it to you gentlemen if that wasnt Jackson Wellss
gait all the time

There was a prolonged murmur of assent and an affecting corroboration
from Ned Wyngate of That was him that was Jacksey all the time

Indeed indeed said the lawyer nervously I had quite the idea that
there was very little fondness

Not on your sidenot on your side said Rice quickly Uncle Quincy
may not have anted up in this matter o feelin nor seen his nephews
rise You know how it is yourself in these thingsbeing a lawyer and a
farminded manits all on one side ginerally Theres always one who
loves and sacrifices and all that and theres always one who rakes in
the pot Thats the way o the world and thats why continued Rice
abandoning his slightly philosophical attitude and laying his hand
tenderly and yet with a singularly significant grip on Wellss arm
we say to him Hang on to that will and uncle Quincys memory
And we hev to say it For hes that tenderhearted and keerless of
moneyhaving his own share in this Ledgethat ef that girl came
whimperin to him hed let her take the prop and let the hull thing
slide And then hed remember that he had rewarded that gal that broke
the old mans heart and that would upset him again in his work And
there you see is just where WE come in And we say Hang on to that
will like grim death

The lawyer looked curiously at Rice and his companions and then turned
to Wells Nevertheless I must look to you for instructions he said
dryly

But by this time Jackson Wells although really dubious about
supplanting the orphan had gathered the sense of his partners and said
with a frank show of decision I think I must stand by the will

Then Ill have it proved said Twiggs rising In the meantime if
there is any talk of contesting

If there is you might say suggested Wyngate who felt he had not had
a fair show in the little comedyye might say to that old skeesicks
of a wifes brother if he wants to nipple in that there are four men
on the Ledgeand four revolvers We are ginrally farminded peaceful
men but when an old mans heart is broken and his gray hairs brought
down in sorrow to the grave so to speak were bound to attend the
funeralsabe

When Mr Twiggs had departed again accompanied by a partner to guide
him past the dangerous shoals of Tomlinsons grocery Rice clapped his
hand on Wellss shoulder If it hadnt been for me sonny that shark
would have landed you into some compromise with that redhaired gal I
saw you weakenin and then I chipped in I may have piled up the agony
a little on your love for old Quince but if you arent an ungrateful
cub thats how you ought to hev been feein anyhow

Nevertheless the youthful Wells although touched by his elder
partners loyalty and convinced of his own disinterestedness felt a
painful sense of lost chivalrous opportunity



On mature consideration it was finally settled that Jackson Wells should
make his preliminary examination of his inheritance alone as it might
seem inconsistent with the previous indifferent attitude of his
partners if they accompanied him But he was implored to yield to no
blandishments of the enemy and to even make his visit a secret

He went The familiar flowerspiked trees which had given their name
to Buckeye Hollow had never yielded entirely to improvements and the
incursions of mining enterprise and many of them had even survived the
disused ditches the scarred flats the discarded levels ruined flumes
and roofless cabins of the earlier occupation so that when Jackson
Wells entered the wide straggling street of Buckeye that summer
morning was filled with the radiance of its blossoms and fragrant with
their incense His first visit there ten years ago had been a purely
perfunctory and hasty one yet he remembered the ostentatious hotel
built in the flush time of its prosperity and already in a green
premature decay he recalled the Express Office and Town Hall also
passing away in a kind of similar green deliquescence the little zinc
church now overgrown with fern and brambles and the two or three fine
substantial houses in the outskirts which seemed to have sucked the
vitality of the little settlement One of thesehe had been toldwas
the property of his rich and wicked maternal uncle the hated
appropriator of his redheaded cousins affections He recalled his
brief visit to the departed testators claim and market garden and his
by no means favorable impression of the lonely crabbed old man as well
as his relief that his objectionable cousin whom he had not seen since
he was a boy was then absent at the rival uncles He made his way
across the road to a sunny slope where the market garden of three acres
seemed to roll like a river of green rapids to a little run or brook
which even in the dry season showed a trickling rill But here he was
struck by a singular circumstance The garden rested in a rich alluvial
soil and under the quickening Californian sky had developed far beyond
the ability of its late cultivator to restrain or keep it in order
Everything had grown luxuriantly and in monstrous size and profusion
The garden had even trespassed its bounds and impinged upon the open
road the deserted claims and the ruins of the past Stimulated by the
little cultivation Quincy Wells had found time to give it it had
leaped its three acres and rioted through the Hollow There were scarlet
runners crossing the abandoned sluices peas climbing the courthouse
wall strawberries matting the trail while the seeds and pollen of
its few homely Eastern flowers had been blown far and wide through the
woods By a grim satire Nature seemed to have been the only thing that
still prospered in that settlement of man

The cabin itself built of unpainted boards consisted of a
sittingroom diningroom kitchen and two bedrooms all plainly
furnished although one of the bedrooms was better ordered and
displayed certain signs of feminine decoration which made Jackson
believe it had been his cousins room Luckily the slight temporary
structure bore no deep traces of its previous occupancy to disturb him
with its memories and for the same reason it gained in cleanliness and
freshness The dry desiccating summer wind that blew through it had
carried away both the odors and the sense of domesticity even the adobe
hearth had no fireside tales to tellits very ashes had been scattered
by the winds and the gravestone of its dead owner on the hill was no
more flavorless of his personality than was this plain house in which he
had lived and died The excessive vegetation produced by the stirredup
soil had covered and hidden the empty tin cans broken boxes and
fragments of clothing which usually heaped and littered the tentpegs
of the pioneer Natures own profusion had thrust them into obscurity
Jackson Wells smiled as he recalled his sanguine partners idea of a
treasuretrove concealed and stuffed in the crevices of this tenement
already so palpably picked clean by those wholesome scavengers of
California the dry air and burning sun Yet he was not displeased at
this obliteration of a previous tenancy there was the better chance for
him to originate something He whistled hopefully as he lounged with
his hands in his pockets towards the only fence and gate that gave upon
the road Something stuck up on the gatepost attracted his attention
It was a sheet of paper bearing the inscription in a large hand Notice
to trespassers Look out for the Orphan Robber A plain signboard in
faded black letters on the gate which had borne the legend Quincy
Wells Dealer in Fruit and Vegetables had been rudely altered in chalk
to read Jackson Wells Double Dealer in Wills and Codicils and the
intimation Bouquets sold here had been changed to Bequests stole
here For an instant the simpleminded Jackson failed to discover
any significance of this outrage which seemed to him to be merely
the wanton mischief of a schoolboy But a sudden recollection of
the lawyers caution sent the blood to his cheeks and kindled
his indignation He tore down the paper and rubbed out the chalk
interpolationand then laughed at his own anger Nevertheless he would
not have liked his belligerent partners to see it

A little curious to know the extent of this feeling he entered one of
the shops and by one or two questions which judiciously betrayed his
ownership of the property he elicited only a tradesmans interest in a
possible future customer and the ordinary curiosity about a stranger
The barkeeper of the hotel was civil but brief and gloomy He had heard
the property was willed away on account of some family quarrel which
warnt none of his Mr Wells would find Buckeye Hollow a mighty dull
place after the mines It was played out sucked dry by two or three big
mine owners who were trying to freeze out the other settlers so as
they might get the place to themselves and boom it Brown who had the
big house over the hill was the head devil of the gang Wells felt his
indignation kindle anew And this girl that he had ousted was Browns
friend Was it possible that she was a party to Browns designs to get
this three acres with the other lands If so his longsuffering uncle
was only just in his revenge

He put all this diffidently before his partners on his return and was a
little startled at their adopting it with sanguine ferocity They hoped
that he would put an end to his thoughts of backing out of it Such a
course now would be dishonorable to his uncles memory It was clearly
his duty to resist these blasted satraps of capitalists he was
providentially selected for the purposea village Hampden to withstand
the tyrant And I reckon that shark of a lawyer knew all about it when
he was gettin off that purp stuff about peoples sympathies with the
girl said Rice belligerently Contest the will would he Why if we
caught that Brown with a finger in the pie wed just whip up the boys on
this Ledge and lynch him You hang on to that three acres and the garden
patch of your forefathers sonny and well see you through

Nevertheless it was with some misgivings that Wells consented that
his three partners should actually accompany him and see him put in
peaceable possession of his inheritance His instinct told him that
there would be no contest of the will and still less any opposition
on the part of the objectionable relative Brown When the wagon
which contained his personal effects and the few articles of furniture
necessary for his occupancy of the cabin arrived the exaggerated
swagger which his companions had put on in their passage through the
settlement gave way to a pastoral indolence equally half real half
affected Lying on their backs under a buckeye they permitted Rice to
voice the general sentiment Theres a suthin soothin and dreamy in
this kind o life Jacksey and well make a point of comin here for a
couple of days every two weeks to lend you a hand it will be a mighty
good change from our nigger work on the claim

In spite of this assurance and the fact that they had voluntarily come
to help him put the place in order they did very little beyond lending
a cheering expression of unqualified praise and unstinted advice At the
end of four hours weeding and trimming the boundaries of the garden
they unanimously gave their opinion that it would be more systematic for
him to employ Chinese labor at once

You see said Ned Wyngate the Chinese naturally take to this kind o
business Why you cant take up a china plate or saucer but you see
em pictured there working at jobs like this and they kin live on green
things and rice that cost nothin and chickens Youll keep chickens
of course

Jackson thought that his hands would be full enough with the garden but
he meekly assented

Ill get a pairyou only want two to begin with continued Wyngate
cheerfully and in a month or two youve got all you want and eggs
enough for market On second thoughts I dont know whether you hadnt
better begin with eggs first That is you borry some eggs from one
man and a hen from another Then you set em and when the chickens are
hatched out you just return the hen to the second man and the eggs
when your chickens begin to lay to the first man and youve got your
chickens for nothingand there you are

This ingenious proposition which was delivered on the last slope of
the domain where the partners were lying exhausted from their work was
broken in upon by the appearance of a small boy barefooted sunburnt
and towheaded who after a moments hurried scrutiny of the group
threw a letter with unerring precision into the lap of Jackson Wells
and then fled precipitately Jackson instinctively suspected he was
connected with the outrage on his fence and gatepost but as he had
avoided telling his partners of the incident fearing to increase their
belligerent attitude he felt now an awkward consciousness mingled with
his indignation as he broke the seal and read as follows


SIRThis is to inform you that although you have got hold of the
property by underhanded and sneaking ways you aint no right to touch
or lay your vile hands on the Cherokee Rose alongside the house nor on
the Giant of Battles nor on the Maidens Pride by the gatethe same
being the property of Miss Jocelinda Wells and planted by her under
the penalty of the Law And if you or any of your gang of ruffians
touches it or them or any thereof or dont deliver it up when called
for in good order you will be persecuted by them

AVENGER


It is to be feared that Jackson would have suppressed this also but the
keen eyes of his partners excited by the abruptness of the messenger
were upon him He smiled feebly and laid the letter before them But
he was unprepared for their exaggerated indignation and with difficulty
restrained them from dashing off in the direction of the vanished
herald And what could you do he said The boys only a messenger

Ill get at that dd skunk Brown whos back of him said Dexter
Rice

And what then persisted Jackson with a certain show of independence
If this stuff belongs to the girl Im not certain I shant give them
up without any fuss Lord I want nothing but what the old man left
meand certainly nothing of HERS

Here Ned Wyngate was heard to murmur that Jackson was one of those
men who would lie down and let coyotes crawl over him if they first
presented a girls visiting card but he was stopped by Rice demanding
paper and pencil The former being torn from a memorandum book and a
stub of the latter produced from another pocket he wrote as follows


SIRIn reply to the hogwash you have kindly exuded in your letter of
today I have to inform you that you can have what you ask for Miss
Wells and perhaps a trifle on your own account by calling this
afternoon onYours truly


Now sign it continued Rice handing him the pencil

But this will look as if we were angry and wanted to keep the plants
protested Wells

Never you mind sonny but sign Leave the rest to your partners
and when you lay your head on your pillow tonight return thanks to an
overruling Providence for providing you with the right gang of ruffians
to look after you

Wells signed reluctantly and Wyngate offered to find a Chinaman in the
gulch who would take the missive And being a Chinaman Brown can do
any cussin or buck talk THROUGH him he added

The afternoon wore on the tall Douglas pines near the water pools
wheeled their long shadows round and halfway up the slope and the sun
began to peer into the faces of the reclining men Subtle odors of mint
and southernwood stragglers from the garden bruised by their limbs
replaced the fumes of their smokedout pipes and the hammers of the
woodpeckers were busy in the grove as they lay lazily nibbling the
fragrant leaves like peaceful ruminants Then came the sound of
approaching wheels along the invisible highway beyond the buckeyes
and then a halt and silence Rice rose slowly bright pin points in the
pupils of his gray eyes

Bringin a wagon with him to tote the hull shanty away suggested
Wyngate

Or fetched his own ambulance said Briggs

Nevertheless after a pause the wheels presently rolled away again

Wed better go and meet him at the gate said Rice hitching his
revolver holster nearer his hip That wagon stopped long enough to put
down three or four men

They walked leisurely but silently to the gate It is probable that none
of them believed in a serious collision but now the prospect had enough
possibility in it to quicken their pulses They reached the gate But it
was still closed the road beyond it empty

Mebbe theyve sneaked round to the cabin said Briggs and are
holdin it inside

They were turning quickly in that direction when Wyngate said
Hushsome ones there in the brush under the buckeyes

They listened there was a faint rustling in the shadows

Come out o that Browninto the open Dont be shy called out Rice
in cheerful irony Were waitin for ye

But Briggs who was nearest the wood here suddenly uttered an
exclamationBgosh and fell back openmouthed upon his
companions They too in another moment broke into a feeble laugh and
lapsed against each other in sheepish silence For a very pretty girl
handsomely dressed swept out of the wood and advanced towards them

Even at any time she would have been an enchanting vision to these men
but in the glow of exercise and sparkle of anger she was bewildering
Her wonderful hair the color of freshly hewn redwood had escaped from
her hat in her passage through the underbrush and even as she swept
down upon them in her majesty she was jabbing a hairpin into it with a
dexterous feminine hand

The three partners turned quite the color of her hair Jackson Wells
alone remained white and rigid She came on her very short upper lip
showing her white teeth with her panting breath

Rice was first to speak I begyour pardon MissI thought it was
Brownyou know he stammered

But she only turned a blighting brown eye on the culprit curled her
short lip till it almost vanished in her scornful nostrils drew her
skirt aside with a jerk and continued her way straight to Jackson
Wells where she halted

We did not know you werehere alone he said apologetically

Thought I was afraid to come alone didnt you Well you see Im not
There She made another dive at her hat and hair and brought the hat
down wickedly over her eyebrows Gimme my plants

Jackson had been astonished He would have scarcely recognized in this
willful beauty the redhaired girl whom he had boyishly hated and with
whom he had often quarreled But there was a recollectionand with that
recollection came an instinct of habit He looked her squarely in the
face and to the horror of his partners said Say please

They had expected to see him fall smitten with the hairpin But she
only stopped and then in bitter irony said Please Mr Jackson
Wells

I havent dug them up yetand it would serve you just right if I
made you get them for yourself But perhaps my friends here might help
youif you were civil

The three partners seized spades and hoes and rushed forward eagerly
Only show us what you want they said in one voice The young girl
stared at them and at Jackson Then with swift determination she turned
her back scornfully upon him and with a dazzling smile which reduced
the three men to absolute idiocy said to the others Ill show YOU
and marched away to the cabin

Ye mustnt mind Jacksey said Rice sycophantically edging to her
side hes so cut up with losin your father that he loved like a son
he isnt himself and dont seem to know whether to ante up or pass out
And as for yourself MisswhyWhat was it he was sayin only just as
the young lady came he added turning abruptly to Wyngate

Everything that cousin Josey planted with her own hands must be took up
carefully and sent backeven though its killin me to part with it
quoted Wyngate unblushingly as he slouched along on the other side

Miss Wellss eyes glared at them though her mouth still smiled
ravishingly Im sure Im troubling you

In a few moments the plants were dug up and carefully laid together
indeed the servile Briggs had added a few that she had not indicated

Would you mind bringing them as far as the buggy thats coming down
the hill she said pointing to a buggy driven by a small boy which
was slowly approaching the gate The men tenderly lifted the uprooted
plants and proceeded solemnly Miss Wells bringing up the rear towards
the gate where Jackson Wells was still surlily lounging

They passed out first Miss Wells lingered for an instant and then
advancing her beautiful but audacious face within an inch of Jacksons
hissed out Makebelieve and hypocrite

Crosspatch and saucebox returned Jackson readily still under the
malign influence of his boyish past as she flounced away

Presently he heard the buggy rattle away with his persecutor But his
partners still lingered on the road in earnest conversation and when
they did return it was with a singular awkwardness and embarrassment
which he naturally put down to a guilty consciousness of their foolish
weakness in succumbing to the girls demands

But he was a little surprised when Dexter Rice approached him gloomily
Of course he began it aint no call of ours to interfere in family
affairs and youve a right to keep em to yourself but if youd been
fair and square and above board in what you got off on us about this
per

What do you mean demanded the astonished Wells

Wellcallin her a redhaired gal

Wellshe is a redhaired girl said Wells impatiently

A man continued Rice pityingly that is so prejudiced as to apply
such language to a beautiful orphantorn with grief at the loss of a
beloved but dd misconstruing parentmerely because she begs a few
vegetables out of his potato patch aint to be reasoned with But when
you come to look at this thing by and large and as a farminded man
sonny youll agree with us that the sooner you make terms with her the
better Considerin your interest Jackseylet alone the claims of
humanityweve concluded to withdraw from here until this thing is
settled Shes sort o mixed us up with your feelings agin her and
naturally supposed we object to the color of her hair and bein a
penniless orphan rejected by her relations

What stuff are you talking burst in Jackson Why YOU saw she
treated you better than she did me

Steady There you go with that temper of yours that frightened the
girl Of course she could see that WE were farminded men accustomed
to the ways of society and not upset by the visit of a lady or the
givin up of a few green sticks But let that slide Were goin back
home tonight sonny and when youve thought this thing over and are
straightened up and get your right bearins well stand by you as
before Well put a man on to do your work on the Ledge so ye neednt
worry about that

They were quite firm in this decisionhowever absurd or obscure their
conclusionsand Jackson after his first flash of indignation felt
a certain relief in their departure But strangely enough while he had
hesitated about keeping the property when they were violently in favor
of it he now felt he was right in retaining it against their advice to
compromise The sentimental idea had vanished with his recognition of
his hateful cousin in the role of the injured orphan And for the same
odd reason her prettiness only increased his resentment He was not
deceivedit was the same capricious willful redhaired girl

The next day he set himself to work with that dogged steadiness that
belonged to his simple nature and which had endeared him to his
partners He set half a dozen Chinamen to work and followed although
apparently directing their methods The great difficulty was to
restrain and control the excessive vegetation and he matched the small
economies of the Chinese against the opulence of the Californian soil
The garden patch prospered the neighbors spoke well of it and of
him But Jackson knew that this fierce harvest of early spring was to be
followed by the sterility of the dry season and that irrigation could
alone make his work profitable in the end He brought a pump to force
the water from the little stream at the foot of the slope to the top
and allowed it to flow back through parallel trenches Again Buckeye
applauded Only the gloomy barkeeper shook his head The moment you get
that thing to pay Mr Wells youll find the hand of Brown somewhere
getting ready to squeeze it dry

But Jackson Wells did not trouble himself about Brown whom he scarcely
knew Once indeed while trenching the slope he was conscious that he
was watched by two men from the opposite bank but they were apparently
satisfied by their scrutiny and turned away Still less did he concern
himself with the movements of his cousin who once or twice passed him
superciliously in her buggy on the road Again she met him as one of
a cavalcade of riders mounted on a handsome but illtempered mustang
which she was managing with an illtemper and grace equal to the
brutes to the alternate delight and terror of her cavalier He could
see that she had been petted and spoiled by her new guardian and his
friends far beyond his conception But why she should grudge him the
little garden and the pastoral life for which she was so unsuited
puzzled him greatly

One afternoon he was working near the road when he was startled by
an outcry from his Chinese laborers their rapid dispersal from the
strawberry beds where they were working the splintering crash of his
fence rails and a commotion among the buckeyes Furious at what seemed
to him one of the usual wanton attacks upon coolie labor he seized
his pick and ran to their assistance But he was surprised to find
Jocelindas mustang caught by the saddle and struggling between two
trees and its unfortunate mistress lying upon the strawberry bed
Shocked but coolheaded Jackson released the horse first who was
lashing out and destroying everything within his reach and then turned
to his cousin But she had already lifted herself to her elbow and
with a trickle of blood and mud on one fair cheek was surveying him
scornfully under her tumbled hair and hanging hat

You dont suppose I was trespassing on your wretched patch again do
you she said in a voice she was trying to keep from breaking It was
that brutewho bolted

I dont suppose you were bullying ME this time he said but you were
YOUR HORSEor it wouldnt have happened Are you hurt

She tried to move he offered her his hand but she shied from it and
struggled to her feet She took a step forwardbut limped

If you dont want my arm let me call a Chinaman he suggested

She glared at him If you do Ill scream she said in a low voice and
he knew she would But at the same moment her face whitened at which he
slipped his arm under hers in a dexterous businesslike way so as to
support her weight Then her hat got askew and down came a long braid
over his shoulder He remembered it of old only it was darker than then
and two or three feet longer

If you could manage to limp as far as the gate and sit down on the
bank Id get your horse for you he said I hitched it to a sapling

I saw you didbefore you even offered to help me she said
scornfully

The horse would have got awayYOU couldnt

If you only knew how I hated you she said with a white face but a
trembling lip

I dont see how that would make things any better he said Better
wipe your face its scratched and muddy and youve been rubbing your
nose in my strawberry bed

She snatched his proffered handkerchief suddenly applied it to her
face and said I suppose it looks dreadful

Like a pigs he returned cheerfully

She walked a little more firmly after this until they reached the gate
He seated her on the bank and went back for the mustang That beautiful
brute astounded and sore from its contact with the top rail and
brambles was cowed and subdued as he led it back

She had finished wiping her face and was hurriedly disentangling
two stinging tears from her long lashes before she threw back his
handkerchief Her sprained ankle obliged him to lift her into the saddle
and adjust her little shoe in the stirrup He remembered when it
was still smaller You used to ride astride he said a flood of
recollection coming over him and its much safer with your temper and
that brute

And you she said in a lower voice used to beBut the rest of her
sentence was lost in the switch of the whip and the jump of her horse
but he thought the word was kinder

Perhaps this was why after he watched her canter away he went back to
the garden and from the bruised and trampled strawberry bed gathered
a small basket of the finest fruit covered them with leaves added a
paper with the highly ingenious witticism Picked up with you and
sent them to her by one of the Chinamen Her forcible entry moved
Li Sing his foreman also chief laundryman to the settlement to
reminiscences

Me heap knew Missy Wells and ole man who go dead Ole man allee

house no can walkeeno can talkeeno hab gothow can getmust

now Plenty fun Plenty stay in Blowns big house topside hill Blown
firstchop man

Had he inquired he might have found this pagan testimony for once
corroborated by the Christian neighbors

But another incident drove all this from his mind The little
streamthe life blood of his gardenran dry Inquiry showed that it
had been diverted two miles away into Browns ditch Wellss indignant
protest elicited a formal reply from Brown stating that he owned the
adjacent mining claims and reminding him that mining rights to water
took precedence of the agricultural claim but offering by way of
compensation to purchase the land thus made useless and sterile
Jackson suddenly recalled the prophecy of the gloomy barkeeper The end
had come But what could the scheming capitalist want with the land
equally uselessas his uncle had provedfor mining purposes Could it
be sheer malignity incited by his vengeful cousin But here he paused
rejecting the idea as quickly as it came No his partners were right
He was a trespasser on his cousins heritagethere was no luck in
ithe was wrong and this was his punishment Instead of yielding
gracefully as he might he must back down now and she would never know
his first real feelings Even now he would make over the property to
her as a free gift But his partners had advanced him money from their
scanty means to plant and work it He believed that an appeal to their
feelings would persuade them to forego even that but he shrank even
more from confessing his defeat to THEM than to her

He had little heart in his labors that day and dismissed the Chinamen
early He again examined his uncles old mining claim on the top of
the slope but was satisfied that it had been a hopeless enterprise
and wisely abandoned It was sunset when he stood under the buckeyes
gloomily looking at the glow fade out of the west as it had out of his
boyish hopes He had grown to like the place It was the hour too when
the few flowers he had cultivated gave back their pleasant odors as if
grateful for his care And then he heard his name called

It was his cousin standing a few yards from him in evident hesitation
She was quite pale and for a moment he thought she was still suffering
from her fall until he saw in her nervous halfembarrassed manner that
it had no physical cause Her old audacity and anger seemed gone yet
there was a queer determination in her pretty brows

Goodevening he said

She did not return his greeting but pulling uneasily at her glove said
hesitatingly Uncle has asked you to sell him this land

Yes

Welldont she burst out abruptly

He stared at her

Oh Im not trying to keep you here she went on flashing back into
her old temper so you neednt stare like that I say Dont because
it aint right it aint fair

Why hes left me no alternative he said

Thats just itthats why its mean and low I dont care if he is our
uncle

Jackson was bewildered and shocked

I know its horrid to say it she said with a white face but its
horrider to keep it in Oh Jack when we were little and used to fight
and quarrel I never was meanwas I I never was underhandedwas I
I never lieddid I And I cant lie now Jack she looked hurriedly
around her HE wants to get hold of the landHE thinks theres gold in
the slope and bank by the stream He says dad was a fool to have located
his claim so high up Jack did you ever prospect the bank

A dawning of intelligence came upon Jackson No he said but he
added bitterly whats the use He owns the water nowI couldnt work
it

But Jack IF you found the color this would be a MINING claim You
could claim the water right and as its your land your claim would be
first

Jackson was startled Yes IF I found the color

You WOULD find it

WOULD

Yes I DIDon the sly Yesterday morning on your slope by the stream
when no one was up I washed a panful and got that She took a piece of
tissue paper from her pocket opened it and shook into her little palm
three tiny pin points of gold

And that was your own idea Jossy

Yes

Your very own

Honest Injin

Wish you may die

True O King

He opened his arms and they mutually embraced Then they separated
taking hold of each others hands solemnly and falling back until they
were at arms length Then they slowly extended their arms sideways at
full length until this action naturally brought their faces and lips
together They did this with the utmost gravity three times and then
embraced again rocking on pivoted feet like a metronome Alas it was
no momentary inspiration The most casual and indifferent observer
could see that it was the result of long previous practice and shameless
experience And as suchit was a revelation and an explanation




I always suspected that Jackson was playin us about that redhaired
cousin said Rice two weeks later but I cant swallow that purp stuff
about her puttin him up to that dodge about a new gold discovery on
a fresh claim just to knock out Brown No sir He found that gold in
openin these irrigatin trenchesthe usual nigger luck findin what
youre not lookin arter

Well we cant complain for hes offered to work it on shares with

THE REINCARNATION OF SMITH


The extravagant supper party by which Mr James Farendell celebrated the
last day of his bachelorhood was protracted so far into the night
that the last guest who parted from him at the door of the principal
Sacramento restaurant was for a moment impressed with the belief that
a certain ruddy glow in the sky was already the dawn But Mr Farendell
had kept his head clear enough to recognize it as the light of some
burning building in a remote business district a not infrequent
occurrence in the dry season When he had dismissed his guest he turned
away in that direction for further information His own countinghouse
was not in that immediate neighborhood but Sacramento had been once
before visited by a rapid and farsweeping conflagration and it
behooved him to be on the alert even on this night of festivity

Perhaps also a certain anxiety arose out of the occasion He was to be
married tomorrow to the widow of his late partner and the
marriage besides being an attractive one would settle many business
difficulties He had been a fortunate man but like many more fortunate
men was not blind to the possibilities of a change of luck The death
of his partner in a successful business had at first seemed to betoken
that change but his successful though hasty courtship of the
inexperienced widow had restored his chances without greatly shocking
the decorum of a pioneer community Nevertheless he was not a contented
man and hardly a determinedalthough an energetic one

A walk of a few moments brought him to the levee of the rivera
favored district where his countinghouse with many others was
conveniently situated In these early days only a few of these buildings
could be said to be permanentfire and flood perpetually threatened
them They were merely temporary structures of wood or in the case
of Mr Farendells office a shell of corrugated iron sheathing
a onestoried wooden frame more or less elaborate in its interior
decorations By the time he had reached it the distant fire had
increased On his way he had met and recognized many of his business
acquaintances hurrying thithersome to save their own property or
to assist the imperfectly equipped volunteer fire department in their
unselfish labors It was probably Mr Farendells peculiar preoccupation
on that particular night which had prevented his joining in their
brotherly zeal

He unlocked the iron door and lit the hanging lamp that was used in
allnight sittings on steamer days It revealed a smartly furnished
office with a high desk for his clerks and a smaller one for himself
in one corner In the centre of the wall stood a large safe This he
also unlocked and took out a few important books as well as a small
drawer containing gold coin and dust to the amount of about five hundred
dollars the large balance having been deposited in bank on the previous
day The act was only precautionary as he did not exhibit any haste in
removing them to a place of safety and remained meditatively absorbed
in looking over a packet of papers taken from the same drawer The
closely shuttered building almost hermetically sealed against light
and perhaps sound prevented his observing the steadily increasing light
of the conflagration or hearing the nearer tumult of the firemen and
the invasion of his quiet district by other equally solicitous tenants
The papers seemed also to possess some importance for the stillness
being suddenly broken by the turning of the handle of the heavy door he
had just closed and its opening with difficulty his first act was
to hurriedly conceal them without apparently paying a thought to the
exposed gold before him And his expression and attitude in facing
round towards the door was quite as much of nervous secretiveness as of
indignation at the interruption

Yet the intruder appeared though singular by no means formidable He
was a man slightly past the middle age with a thin face hollowed at
the cheeks and temples as if by illness or asceticism and a grayish
beard that encircled his throat like a soiled worsted comforter below
his cleanshaven chin and mouth His manner was slow and methodical and
even when he shot the bolt of the door behind him the act did not seem
aggressive Nevertheless Mr Farendell half rose with his hand on
his pistolpocket but the stranger merely lifted his own hand with
a gesture of indifferent warning and drawing a chair towards him
dropped into it deliberately

Mr Farendells angry stare changed suddenly to one of surprised
recognition Josh Scranton he said hesitatingly

I reckon responded the stranger slowly Thats the name I allus
bore and YOU called yourself Farendell Well we aint seen each other
sens the spring o 50 when ye left me lying nigh petered out with
chills and fever on the Stanislaus River and sold the claim that me and
Duffy worked under our very feet and skedaddled for Frisco

I only exercised my right as principal owner and to secure my
advances began the late Mr Farendell sharply

But again the thin hand was raised this time with a slow scornful
waiving of any explanations It aint that in partickler that Ive kem
to see ye for tonight said the stranger slowly nor it aint about
your takin the name o Farendell that friend o yours who died on
the passage here with ye and whose papers ye borrowed Nor it aint
on account o that wife of yours ye left behind in Missouri and whose
letters you never answered Its them things all togetherand suthin
else

What the dl do you want then said Farendell with a desperate
directness that was however a tacit confession of the truth of these
accusations

Yer allowin that yell get married tomorrow said Scranton slowly

Yes and be dd to you said Farendell fiercely

Yer NOT returned Scranton Not if I knows it Yer goin to climb
down Yer goin to get up and get Yer goin to step down and out Yer
goin to shut up your desk and your books and this hull consarn inside
of an hour and vamose the ranch Arter an hour from now thar wont be
any Mr Farendell and no weddin tomorrow

If thats your gameperhaps youd like to murder me at once said
Farendell with a shifting eye as his hand again moved towards his
revolver

But again the thin hand of the stranger was also lifted We aint in
the business o murderin or bein murdered or we might hev kem here
together me and Duffy Now if anything happens to me Duffy will be
left and HES got the proofs

Farendell seemed to recognize the fact with the same directness Thats
it is it he said bluntly Well how much do you want Only I warn
you that I havent much to give

Wotever youve got if it was millions it aint enough to buy us up
and ye ought to know that by this time responded Scranton with
a momentary flash in his eyes But the next moment his previous
passionless deliberation returned and leaning his arm on the desk of
the man before him he picked up a paperweight carelessly and turned it
over as he said slowly The fact is Mr Farendell youve been making
us me and Duffy tired Weve bin watchin you and your doins lyin
low and sayin nothin till we concluded that it was about time you
handed in your checks and left the board We aint wanted nothin of
ye we aint begrudged ye nothin but weve allowed that this yer thing
must stop

And what if I refuse said Farendell

Tharll be some cussin and a big row from YOU I kalkilateand maybe
some fightin all round said Scranton dispassionately But it will be
all the same in the end The hull thing will come out and youll hev
to slide just the same Totherwise ef ye slide out NOW its without a
row

And do you suppose a business man like me can disappear without a fuss
over it said Farendell angrily Are you mad

I reckon the hole YOULL make kin be filled up said Scranton dryly
But ef ye go NOW you wont be bothered by the fuss while if you stay
youll have to face the music and go too

Farendell was silent Possibly the truth of this had long since been
borne upon him No one but himself knew the incessant strain of these
years of evasion and concealment and how he often had been near to
some such desperate culmination The sacrifice offered to him was not
therefore so great as it might have seemed The knowledge of this
might have given him a momentary superiority over his antagonist had
Scrantons motive been a purely selfish or malignant one but as it was
not and as he may have had some instinctive idea of Farendells feeling
also it made his ultimatum appear the more passionless and fateful
And it was this quality which perhaps caused Farendell to burst out with
desperate abruptness

What in hll ever put you up to this

Scranton folded his arms upon Farendells desk and slowly wiping his
clean jaw with one hand repeated deliberately WallI reckon I told
ye that before Youve been making usme and Duffytired He paused
for a moment and then rising abruptly with a careless gesture towards
the uncovered tray of gold said Come ye kin take enuff o that to
get away with the less ye take though the less likely youll be to be
followed

He went to the door unlocked and opened it A strange light as of
a lurid storm interspersed by sheetlike lightning filled the outer
darkness and the silence was now broken by dull crashes and nearer
cries and shouting A few figures were also dimly flitting around the
neighboring empty offices some of which like Farendells had been
entered by their now alarmed owners

Youve got a good chance now continued Scranton ye couldnt hev a
better Its a big firea scorcherand jest the time for a man to wipe
himself out and not be missed Make tracks where the crowd is thickest
and whar yere likely to be seen ez ef ye were helpin Ther ll be
other men missed tomorrow beside you he added with grim significance
but nobodyll know that you was one who really got away

Where the imperturbable logic of the strange man might have failed
the noise the tumult the suggestion of swiftcoming disaster and
the necessity for some immediate action of any kind was convincing
Farendell hastily stuffed his pockets with gold and the papers he had
found and moved to the door Already he fancied he felt the hot
breath of the leaping conflagration beyond And you he said turning
suspiciously to Scranton

When youre shut of this and clean off Ill fix things and leave
toobut not before I reckon he added grimly with a glance at the
sky now streaming with sparks like a meteoric shower thar wont be
much left here in the morning

A few dull embers pattered on the iron roof of the low building and
bounded off in ashes Farendell cast a final glance around him and then
darted from the building The iron door clanged behind himhe was gone

Evidently not too soon for the other buildings were already deserted by
their wouldbe salvors who had filled the streets with piles of books
and valuables waiting to be carried away Then occurred a terrible
phenomenon which had once before in such disasters paralyzed the
efforts of the firemen A large wooden warehouse in the centre of
the block of offices many hundred feet from the scene of active
conflagrationwhich had hitherto remained intactsuddenly became
enveloped in clouds of smoke and without warning burst as suddenly
from roof and upper story into vivid flame There were eyewitnesses who
declared that a stream of living fire seemed to leap upon it from the
burning district and connected the space between them with an arch of
luminous heat In another instant the whole district was involved in
a whirlwind of smoke and flame out of whose seething vortex the
corrugated iron buildings occasionally showed their shriveling or
glowing outlines And then the fire swept on and away

When the sun again arose over the panicstricken and devastated city
all personal incident and disaster was forgotten in the larger
calamity It was two or three days before the full particulars could be
gatheredeven while the dominant and resistless energy of the people
was erecting new buildings upon the stillsmoking ruins It was only on
the third day afterwards that James Farendell on the deck of a coasting
steamer creeping out through the fogs of the Golden Gate read the
latest news in a San Francisco paper brought by the pilot As he
hurriedly comprehended the magnitude of the loss which was far beyond
his previous conception he experienced a certain satisfaction in
finding his position no worse materially than that of many of his fellow
workers THEY were ruined like himself THEY must begin their life
afreshbut then Ah there was still that terrible difference He drew
his breath quickly and read on Suddenly he stopped transfixed by
a later paragraph For an instant he failed to grasp its full
significance Then he read it again the words imprinting themselves on
his senses with a slow deliberation that seemed to him as passionless as
Scrantons utterances on that fateful night

The loss of life it is now feared is much greater than at first
imagined To the list that has been already published we must add the
name of James Farendell the energetic contractor so well known to
our citizens who was missing the morning after the fire His calcined
remains were found this afternoon in the warped and twisted iron shell
of his countinghouse the wooden frame having been reduced to charcoal
in the intense heat The unfortunate man seems to have gone there to
remove his books and papersas was evidenced by the iron safe being
found openbut to have been caught and imprisoned in the building
through the heat causing the metal sheathing to hermetically seal the
doors and windows He was seen by some neighbors to enter the building
while the fire was still distant and his remains were identified by his
keys which were found beneath him A poignant interest is added to his
untimely fate by the circumstance that he was to have been married on
the following day to the widow of his late partner and that he had
at the call of duty that very evening left a dinner party given to
celebrate the last day of his bachelorhoodor as it has indeed proved
of his earthly existence Two families are thus placed in mourning and
it is a singular sequel that by this untoward calamity the wellknown
firm of Farendell  Cutler may be said to have ceased to exist

Mr Farendell started to his feet But a lurch of the schooner as she
rose on the long swell of the Pacific sent him staggering dizzily back
to his seat and checked his first wild impulse to return He saw it all
nowthe fire had avenged him by wiping out his persecutor Scranton
but in the eyes of his contemporaries it had only erased HIM He might
return to refute the story in his own person but the dead mans partner
still lived with his secret and his own rehabilitation could only
revive his former peril




Four years elapsed before the late Mr Farendell again set foot in the
levee of Sacramento The steamboat that brought him from San Francisco
was a marvel to him in size elegance and comfort so different from
the little crowded triweekly packet he remembered and it might in a
manner have prepared him for the greater change in the city But he was
astounded to find nothing to remind him of the pastno landmark nor
even ruin of the place he had known Blocks of brick buildings with
thoroughfares having strange titles occupied the district where his
countinghouse had stood and even obliterated its site equally strange
names were upon the shops and warehouses In his four years wanderings
he had scarcely found a place as unfamiliar He had trusted to the
great change in his own appearancethe full beard that he wore and the
tanning of a tropical sunto prevent recognition but the precaution
was unnecessary there were none to recognize him in the new faces which
were the only ones he saw in the transformed city A cautious allusion
to the past which he had made on the boat to a fellow passenger had
brought only the surprised rejoinder Oh that must have been before
the big fire as if it was an historic epoch There was something of
pain even in this assured security of his loneliness His obliteration
was complete

For the late Mr Farendell had suffered some change of mind with his
other mutations He had been singularly lucky The schooner in which he
had escaped brought him to Acapulco where as a returning Californian
and a presumably successful one his services and experience were
eagerly sought by an English party engaged in developing certain disused
Mexican mines As the post however was perilously near the route
of regular emigration as soon as he had gained a sufficient sum he
embarked with some goods to Callao where he presently established
himself in business resuming his REAL namethe unambitious but
indistinctive one of Smith It is highly probable that this prudential
act was also his first step towards rectitude For whether the change
was a question of moral ethics or merely a superstitious essay in luck
he was thereafter strictly honest in business He became prosperous
He had been sustained in his flight by the intention that if he
were successful elsewhere he would endeavor to communicate with his
abandoned fiancee and ask her to join him and share not his name but
fortune in exile But as he grew rich the difficulties of carrying out
this intention became more apparent he was by no means certain of her
loyalty surviving the deceit he had practiced and the revelation he
would have to make he was doubtful of the success of any story which
at other times he would have glibly invented to take the place of truth
Already several months had elapsed since his supposed death could he
expect her to be less accessible to premature advances now than when
she had been a widow Perhaps this made him think of the wife he had
deserted so long ago He had been quite content to live without regret
or affection forgetting and forgotten but in his present prosperity
he felt there was some need of putting his domestic affairs into a more
secure and legitimate shape to avert any catastrophe like the last
HERE at least would be no difficulty husbands had deserted their wives
before this in Californian emigration and had been heard of only after
they had made their fortune Any plausible story would be accepted by
HER in the joy of his reappearance or if indeed as he reflected
with equal complacency she was dead or divorced from him through his
desertiona sufficient cause in her own Stateand remarried he
would at least be more secure He began without committing himself
by inquiry and anonymous correspondence His wife he learnt had left
Missouri for Sacramento only a month or two after his own disappearance
from that place and her address was unknown

A complication so unlooked for disquieted him and yet whetted his
curiosity The only person she might meet in California who could
possibly identify him with the late Mr Farendell was Duffy he had
often wondered if that mysterious partner of Scrantons had been
deceived with the others or had ever suspected that the body discovered
in the countinghouse was Scrantons If not he must have accepted the
strange coincidence that Scranton had disappeared also the same night
In the first six months of his exile he had searched the Californian
papers thoroughly but had found no record of any doubt having been
thrown on the accepted belief It was these circumstances and perhaps
a vague fascination not unlike that which impels the malefactor to haunt
the scene of his crime that at the end of four years had brought him
a man of middle age and assured occupation and fortune back to the city
he had fled from

A few days at one of the new hotels convinced him thoroughly that he was
in no danger of recognition and gave him the assurance to take rooms
more in keeping with his circumstances and his own frankly
avowed position as the head of a South American house A cautious
acquaintancethrough the agency of his bankerwith a few business men
gave him some occupation and the fact of his South American letters
being addressed to Don Diego Smith gave a foreign flavor to his
individuality which his tanned face and dark beard had materially
helped A stronger test convinced him how complete was the obliteration
of his former identity One day at the bank he was startled at being
introduced by the manager to a man whom he at once recognized as a
former business acquaintance But the shock was his alone the formal
approach and unfamiliar manner of the man showed that he had failed to
recognize even a resemblance But would he equally escape detection by
his wife if he met her as accidentallyan encounter not to be thought
of until he knew something more of her He became more cautious in going
to public places but luckily for him the proportion of women to men was
still small in California and they were more observed than observing

A month elapsed in that time he had thoroughly exhausted the local
Directories in his cautious researches among the Smiths for in his
fear of precipitating a premature disclosure he had given up his former
anonymous advertising And there was a certain occupation in this
personal quest that filled his business time He was in no hurry He had
a singular faith that he would eventually discover her whereabouts be
able to make all necessary inquiries into her conduct and habits and
perhaps even enjoy a brief season of unsuspected personal observation
before revealing himself And this faith was as singularly rewarded

Having occasion to get his watch repaired one day he entered a large
jewelers shop and while waiting its examination his attention was
attracted by an ordinary oldfashioned daguerreotype case in the form of
a heartshaped locket lying on the counter with other articles left for
repairs Something in its appearance touched a chord in his memory he
lifted the halfopened case and saw a much faded daguerreotype
portrait of himself taken in Missouri before he left in the Californian
emigration He recognized it at once as one he had given to his wife
the faded likeness was so little like his present self that he boldly
examined it and asked the jeweler one or two questions The man was
communicative Yes it was an oldfashioned affair which had been left
for repairs a few days ago by a lady whose name and address written by
herself were on the card tied to it

Mr James Smith had by this time fully controlled the emotion he felt as
he recognized his wifes name and handwriting and knew that at last
the clue was found He laid down the case carelessly gave the final
directions for the repairs of his watch and left the shop The address
of which he had taken a mental note was to his surprise very near
his own lodgings but he went straight home Here a few inquiries of
his janitor elicited the information that the building indicated in the
address was a large one of furnished apartments and offices like his
own and that the Mrs Smith must be simply the housekeeper of the
landlord whose name appeared in the Directory but not her own Yet
he waited until evening before he ventured to reconnoitre the premises
with the possession of his clue came a slight cooling of his ardor and
extreme caution in his further proceedings The housea reconstructed
wooden buildingoffered no external indication of the rooms she
occupied in the uniformly curtained windows that front the street
Yet he felt an odd and pleasurable excitement in passing once or twice
before those walls that hid the goal of his quest As yet he had not
seen her and there was naturally the added zest of expectation He
noticed that there was a new building opposite with vacant offices to
let A project suddenly occurred to him which by morning he had fully
matured He hired a front room in the first floor of the new building
had it hurriedly furnished as a private office and on the second
morning of his discovery was installed behind his desk at the window
commanding a full view of the opposite house There was nothing strange
in the South American capitalist selecting a private office in so
popular a locality

Two or three days elapsed without any result from his espionage He came
to know by sight the various tenants the two Chinese servants and the
solitary Irish housemaid but as yet had no glimpse of the housekeeper
She evidently led a secluded life among her duties it occurred to him
that perhaps she went out possibly to market earlier than he came
or later after he had left the office In this belief he arrived one
morning after an early walk in a smart spring shower the lingering
straggler of the winter rains There were few people astir yet he had
been preceded for two or three blocks by a tall woman whose umbrella
partly concealed her head and shoulders from view He had noticed
however even in his abstraction that she walked well and managed the
lifting of her skirt over her trim ankles and wellbooted feet with some
grace and cleverness Yet it was only on her unexpectedly turning the
corner of his own street that he became interested She continued on
until within a few doors of his office when she stopped to give an
order to a tradesman who was just taking down his shutters He heard
her voice distinctly in the quick emotion it gave him he brushed
hurriedly past her without lifting his eyes Gaining his own doorway
he rushed upstairs to his office hastily unlocked it and ran to the
window The lady was already crossing the street He saw her pause
before the door of the opposite house open it with a latchkey and
caught a full view of her profile in the single moment that she turned
to furl her umbrella and enter It was his wifes voice he had heard it
was his wifes face that he had seen in profile

Yet she was changed from the lanky young schoolgirl he had wedded ten
years ago or at least compared to what his recollection of her had
been Had he ever seen her as she really was Surely somewhere in that
timid freckled halfgrown bride he had known in the first year of
their marriage the germ of this selfpossessed matured woman was
hidden There was the tone of her voice he had never recalled it before
as a lover might yet now it touched him her profile he certainly
remembered but not with the feeling it now produced in him Would he
have ever abandoned her had she been like that Or had HE changed and
was this no longer his old selfperhaps even a self SHE would never
recognize again James Smith had the superstitions of a gambler and
that vague idea of fate that comes to weak men a sudden fright seized
him and he half withdrew from the window lest she should observe him
recognize him and by some act precipitate that fate

By lingering beyond the usual hour for his departure he saw her again
and had even a full view of her face as she crossed the street The
years had certainly improved her he wondered with a certain nervousness
if she would think they had done the same for him The complacency with
which he had at first contemplated her probable joy at recovering him
had become seriously shaken since he had seen her a woman as well
preserved and goodlooking as that holding a certain responsible
and no doubt lucrative position must have many admirers and be
independent He longed to tell her now of his fortune and yet shrank
from the test its exposure implied He waited for her return until
darkness had gathered and then went back to his lodgings a little
chagrined and ill at ease It was rather late for her to be out alone
After all what did he know of her habits or associations He recalled
the freedom of Californian life and the old scandals relating to the
lapses of many women who had previously led blameless lives in the
Atlantic States Clearly it behooved him to be cautious Yet he
walked late that night before the house again eager to see if she had
returned and with WHOM He was restricted in his eagerness by the
fear of detection but he gathered very little knowledge of her habits
singularly enough nobody seemed to care A little piqued at this he
began to wonder if he were not thinking too much of this woman to whom
he still hesitated to reveal himself Nevertheless he found himself
that night again wandering around the house and even watching with some
anxiety the shadow which he believed to be hers on the windowblind
of the room where he had by discreet inquiry located her Whether his
memory was stimulated by his quest he never knew but presently he was
able to recall step by step and incident by incident his early courtship
of her and the brief days of their married life He even remembered the
day she accepted him and even dwelt upon it with a sentimental thrill
that he probably never felt at the time and it was a distinct feature
of his extraordinary state of mind and its concentration upon this
particular subject that he presently began to look upon HIMSELF as the
abandoned and deserted conjugal partner and to nurse a feeling of deep
injury at her hands The fact that he was thinking of her and she
probably contented with her lot was undisturbed by any memory of him
seemed to him a logical deduction of his superior affection

It was therefore quite as much in the attitude of a reproachful and
avenging husband as of a merely curious one that one afternoon seeing
her issue from her house at an early hour he slipped down the stairs
and began to follow her at a secure distance She turned into the
principal thoroughfare and presently made one of the crowd who were
entering a popular place of amusement where there was an afternoon
performance So complete was his selfish hallucination that he smiled
bitterly at this proof of heartless indifference and even so far
overcame his previous caution as to actually brush by her somewhat
rudely as he entered the building at the same moment He was conscious
that she lifted her eyes a little impatiently to the face of the awkward
stranger he was equally but more bitterly conscious that she had not
recognized him He dropped into a seat behind her she did not look at
him again with even a sense of disturbance the momentary contact had
evidently left no impression upon her She glanced casually at
her neighbors on either side and presently became absorbed in the
performance When it was over she rose and on her way out recognized
and exchanged a few words with one or two acquaintances Again he
heard her familiar voice almost at his elbow raised with no more
consciousness of her contiguity to him than if he were a mere ghost
The thought struck him for the first time with a hideous and appalling
significance What was he but a ghost to herto every one A man dead
buried and forgotten His vanity and selfcomplacency vanished before
this crushing realization of the hopelessness of his existence Dazed
and bewildered he mingled blindly and blunderingly with the departing
crowd tossed here and there as if he were an invisible presence
stumbling over the impeding skirts of women with a vague apology they
heeded not and which seemed in his frightened ears as hollow as a voice
from the grave

When he at last reached the street he did not look back but wandered
abstractedly through bystreets in the falling rain scarcely realizing
where he was until he found himself drenched through with his closed
umbrella in his tremulous hand standing at the halfsubmerged levee
beside the overflowed river Here again he realized how completely he
had been absorbed and concentrated in his search for his wife during the
last three weeks he had never been on the levee since his arrival He
had taken no note of the excitement of the citizens over the alarming
reports of terrible floods in the mountains and the daily and hourly
fear that they experienced of disastrous inundation from the surcharged
river He had never thought of it yet he had read of it and even
talked and yet now for the first time in his selfish blind absorption
was certain of it He stood still for some time watching doggedly the
enormous yellow stream laboring with its burden and drift from many
a mountain town and camp moving steadily and fatefully towards the
distant bay and still more distant and inevitable ocean For a few
moments it vaguely fascinated and diverted him then it as vaguely lent
itself to his one dominant haunting thought Yes it was pointing him
the only way outthe path to the distant ocean and utter forgetfulness
again

The chill of his saturated clothing brought him to himself once more
he turned and hurried home He went tiredly to his bedroom and while
changing his garments there came a knock at the door It was the
porter to say that a lady had called and was waiting for him in the
sittingroom She had not given her name

The closed door prevented the servant from seeing the extraordinary
effect produced by this simple announcement upon the tenant For
one instant James Smith remained spellbound in his chair It was
characteristic of his weak nature and singular prepossession that
he passed in an instant from the extreme of doubt to the extreme of
certainty and conviction It was his wife She had recognized him in
that moment of encounter at the entertainment had found his address
and had followed him here He dressed himself with feverish haste not
however without a certain care of his appearance and some selection of
apparel and quickly forecast the forthcoming interview in his mind
For the pendulum had swung back Mr James Smith was once more the
selfsatisfied selfcomplacent and discreetly cautious husband that he
had been at the beginning of his quest perhaps with a certain sense
of grievance superadded He should require the fullest explanations and
guarantees before committing himselfindeed her present call might be
an advance that it would be necessary for him to check He even pictured
her pleading at his feet a very little stronger effort of his Alnaschar
imagination would have made him reject her like the fatuous Persian
glass peddler

He opened the door of the sittingroom deliberately and walked in with
a certain formal precision But the figure of a woman arose from the
sofa and with a slight outcry half playful half hysterical threw
herself upon his breast with the single exclamation Jim He started
back from the double shock For the woman was NOT his wife A woman
extravagantly dressed still young but bearing even through her
artificially heightened color a face worn with excitement excess and
premature age Yet a face that as he disengaged himself from her arms
grew upon him with a terrible recognition a face that he had once
thought pretty inexperienced and innocentthe face of the widow of
his former partner Cutler the woman he was to have married on the day
he fled The bitter revulsion of feeling and astonishment was evidently
visible in his face for she too drew back for a moment as they
separated But she had evidently been prepared if not pathetically
inured to such experiences She dropped into a chair again with a dry
laugh and a hard metallic voice as she said

Well its YOU anywayand you cant get out of it

As he still stared at her in her inconsistent finery draggled and
wet by the storm at her limp ribbons and ostentatious jewelry she
continued in the same hard voice

I thought I spotted you once or twice before but you took no notice of
me and I reckoned I was mistaken But this afternoon at the Temple of
Music

Where said James Smith harshly

At the Templethe San Francisco Troupe performancewhere you brushed
by me and I heard your voice saying Beg pardon I says Thats Jim
Farendell

Farendell burst out James Smith half in simulated astonishment half
in real alarm

Well Smith then if you like better said the woman impatiently
though its about the sickest and most playedout dodge of a name you
could have pitched upon James Smith Don Diego Smith she repeated
with a hysteric laugh Why it beats the nigger minstrels all hollow
Well when I saw you there I said Thats Jim Farendell or his twin
brother I didnt say his ghost mind you for from the beginning
even before I knew it all I never took any stock in that fool yarn
about your burnt bones being found in your office

Knew all knew what demanded the man with a bravado which he
nevertheless felt was hopeless

She rose crossed the room and standing before him placed one hand
upon her hip as she looked at him with halfpitying effrontery

Look here Jim she began slowly do you know what youre doing
Well youre making me tired In spite of himself a halfsuperstitious
thrill went through him as her words and attitude recalled the dead
Scranton Do you suppose that I dont know that you ran away the night
of the fire Do you suppose that I dont know that you were next to
ruined that night and that you took that opportunity of skedaddling
out of the country with all the money you had left and leaving folks
to imagine you were burnt up with the books you had falsified and the
accounts you had doctored It was a mean thing for you to do to me Jim
for I loved you then and would have been fool enough to run off with
you if youd told me all and not left me to find out that you had lost
MY moneyevery cent Cutler had left me in the businesswith the rest

With the fatuousness of a weak man cornered he clung to unimportant
details But the body was believed to be mine by every one he
stammered angrily My papers and books were burntthere was no
evidence

And why was there not she said witheringly staring doggedly in his
face Because I stopped it Because when I knew those bones and rags
shut up in that office werent yours and was beginning to make a row
about it a strange man came to me and said they were the remains of a
friend of his who knew your bankruptcy and had come that night to warn
youa man whom you had half ruined once a man who had probably lost
his life in helping you away He said if I went on making a fuss hed
come out with the whole truthhow you were a thief and a forger
andshe stopped

And what else he asked desperately dreading to hear his wifes name
next fall from her lips

And thatas it could be proved that his friend knew your secrets
she went on in a frightened embarrassed voice you might be accused of
making away with him

For a moment James Smith was appalled he had never thought of this As
in all his past villainy he was too cowardly to contemplate murder
he was frightened at the mere accusation of it But he stammered
forgetful of all save this new terror he KNEW I wouldnt be such a
fool for the man himself told me Duffy had the papers and killing him
wouldnt have helped me

Mrs Cutler stared at him a moment searchingly and then turned wearily
away Well she said sinking into her chair again he said if Id
shut my mouth hed shut hisandI did And this she added
throwing her hands from her lap a gesture half of reproach and half of
contemptthis is what I get for it

More frightened than touched by the womans desperation James Smith
stammered a vague apologetic disclaimer even while he was loathing with
a revulsion new to him her draggled finery her still more faded beauty
and the halfdistinct consciousness of guilt that linked her to him But
she waved it away a weary gesture that again reminded him of the dead
Scranton

Of course I aint what I was but whos to blame for it When you left
me alone without a cent face to face with a lie I had to do something
I wasnt brought up to work I like good clothes and you know it
better than anybody I aint one of your stage heroines that go out as
dependants and governesses and die of consumption but I thought she
went on with a shrill hysterical laugh more painful than the weariness
which inevitably followed it I thought I might train myself to do it
ON THE STAGE and I joined Barkers Company They said I had a face
and figure for the stage that face and figure wore out before I had
anything more to show and I wasnt big enough to make better terms with
the manager They kept me nearly a year doing chambermaids and fairy
queens the other side of the footlights where I saw you today Then I
kicked I suppose I might have married some fool for his money but I
was soft enough to think you might be sending for me when you were safe
You seem to be mighty comfortable here she continued with a bitter
glance around his handsomely furnished room as Don Diego Smith I
reckon skedaddling pays better than staying behind

I have only been here a few weeks he said hurriedly I never knew
what had become of you or that you were still here

Or you wouldnt have come she interrupted with a bitter laugh
Speak out Jim

If thereis anythingI can dofor you he stammered Im sure

Anything you can do she repeated slowly and scornfully Anything
you can do NOW Yes she screamed suddenly rising crossing the
room and grasping his arms convulsively Yes Take me away from
hereanywhereat once Look Jim she went on feverishly let
bygones be bygonesI wont peach I wont tell on youthough I had it
in my heart when you gave me the goby just now Ill do anything you
saygo to your farthest hidingplacework for youonly take me out of
this cursed place

Her passionate pleading stung even through his selfishness and loathing
He thought of his wifes indifference Yes he might be driven to
this and at least he must secure the only witness against his previous
misconduct We will see he said soothingly gently loosening her
hands We must talk it over He stopped as his old suspiciousness
returned But you must have some friends he said searchingly some
one who has helped you

None Only onehe helped me at first she hesitatedDuffy

Duffy said James Smith recoiling

Yes when he had to tell me all she said in halffrightened tones
he was sorry for me Listen Jim He was a square man for all he was
devoted to his partnerand you cant blame him for that I think he
helped me because I was alone for nothing else Jim I swear it He
helped me from time to time Maybe he might have wanted to marry me if
he had not been waiting for another woman that he loved a married woman
that had been deserted years ago by her husband just as you might have
deserted me if wed been married that day He helped her and paid for
her journey here to seek her husband and set her up in business

What are you talking aboutwhat woman stammered James Smith with a
strange presentiment creeping over him

A Mrs Smith Yes she said quickly as he started not a sham name
like yours but really and truly SMITHthat was her husbands name
Im not lying Jim she went on evidently mistaking the cause of the
sudden contraction of the mans face I didnt invent her nor her name
there IS such a woman and Duffy loves herand HER only and he never
NEVER was anything more than a friend to me I swear it

The room seemed to swim around him She was staring at him but he could
see in her vacant eyes that she had no conception of his secret nor
knew the extent of her revelation Duffy had not dared to tell all He
burst into a coarse laugh What matters Duffy or the silly woman hed
try to steal away from other men

But he didnt try to steal her and shes only silly because she wants
to be true to her husband while he lives She told Duffy shed never
marry him until she saw her husbands dead face More fool she she
added bitterly

Until she saw her husbands dead face was all that James Smith heard
of this speech His wifes faithfulness through years of desertion her
long waiting and truthfulness even the bitter commentary of the equally
injured woman before him were to him as nothing to what that single
sentence conjured up He laughed again but this time strangely and
vacantly Enough of this Duffy and his intrusion in my affairs until
Im able to settle my account with him Come he added brusquely if
we are going to cut out of this at once Ive got much to do Come here
again tomorrow early This Duffydoes he live here

No In Marysville

Good Come early tomorrow

As she seemed to hesitate he opened a drawer of his table and took out
a handful of gold and handed it to her She glanced at it for a moment
with a strange expression put it mechanically in her pocket and then
looking up at him said with a forced laugh I suppose that means I am
to clear out

Until tomorrow he said shortly

If the Sacramento dont sweep us away before then she interrupted
with a reckless laugh the rivers broken through the leveea clear
sweep in two places Where I live the waters up to the doorstep They
say its going to be the biggest flood yet Youre all right here
youre on higher ground

She seemed to utter these sentences abstractedly disconnectedly as if
to gain time He made an impatient gesture

All right Im going she said compressing her lips slowly to keep
them from trembling You havent forgotten anything As he turned half
angrily towards her she added hurriedly and bitterly Anythingfor
tomorrow

No

She opened the door and passed out He listened until the trail of
her wet skirt had descended the stairs and the street door had closed
behind her Then he went back to his table and began collecting his
papers and putting them away in his trunks which he packed feverishly
yet with a set and determined face He wrote one or two letters which
he sealed and left upon his table He then went to his bedroom and
deliberately shaved off his disguising beard Had he not been so
preoccupied in one thought he might have been conscious of loud voices
in the street and a hurrying of feet on the wet sidewalk But he was
possessed by only one idea He must see his wife that evening How he
knew not yet but the way would appear when he had reached his office
in the building opposite hers Three hours had elapsed before he had
finished his preparations On going downstairs he stopped to give some
directions to the porter but his room was empty passing into the
street he was surprised to find it quite deserted and the shops closed
even a drinking saloon at the corner was quite empty He turned the
corner of the street and began the slight descent towards his office
To his amazement the lower end of the street which was crossed by
the thoroughfare which was his destination was blocked by a crowd of
people As he hurried forward to join them he suddenly saw moving
down that thoroughfare what appeared to his startled eyes to be the
smokestacks of some small flatbottomed steamer He rubbed his eyes it
was no illusion for the next moment he had reached the crowd who were
standing half a block away from the thoroughfare and on the edge of a
lagoon of yellow water whose main current was the thoroughfare he was
seeking and between whose houses submerged to their first stories a
steamboat was really paddling Other boats and rafts were adrift on
its sluggish waters and a boatman had just landed a passenger in the
backwater of the lower half of the street on which he stood with the
crowd

Possessed of his one idea he fought his way desperately to the water
edge and the boat and demanded a passage to his office The boatman
hesitated but James Smith promptly offered him double the value of his
craft The act was not deemed singular in that extravagant epoch and
the sympathizing crowd cheered his solitary departure as he declined
even the services of the boatman The next moment he was off in
midstream of the thoroughfare paddling his boat with a desperate but
inexperienced hand until he reached his office which he entered by the
window The building which was new and of brick showed very little
damage from the flood but in far different case was the one opposite
on which his eyes were eagerly bent and whose cheap and insecure
foundations he could see the flood was already undermining There were
boats around the house and men hurriedly removing trunks and valuables
but the one figure he expected to see was not there He tied his own
boat to the window there was evidently no chance of an interview now
but if she were leaving there would be still the chance of following
her and knowing her destination As he gazed she suddenly appeared at
a window and was helped by a boatman into a flatbottomed barge
containing trunks and furniture She was evidently the last to leave
The other boats put off at once and none too soon for there was a
warning cry a quick swerving of the barge and the end of the dwelling
slowly dropped into the flood seeming to sink on its knees like a
stricken ox A great undulation of yellow water swept across the street
inundating his office through the open window and half swamping his boat
beside it At the same time he could see that the current had changed
and increased in volume and velocity and from the cries and warning
of the boatmen he knew that the river had burst its banks at its upper
bend He had barely time to leap into his boat and cast it off before
there was a foot of water on his floor

But the new current was carrying the boats away from the higher level
which they had been eagerly seeking and towards the channel of the
swollen river The barge was first to feel its influence and was
hurried towards the river against the strongest efforts of its boatmen
One by one the other and smaller boats contrived to get into the slack
water of crossing streets and one was swamped before his eyes But
James Smith kept only the barge in view His difficulty in following it
was increased by his inexperience in managing a boat and the quantity
of drift which now charged the current Trees torn by their roots from
some upland bank sheds logs timber and the bloated carcasses of
cattle choked the stream All the ruin worked by the flood seemed to be
compressed in this disastrous current Once or twice he narrowly escaped
collision with a heavy beam or the bed of some farmers wagon Once he
was swamped by a tree and righted his frail boat while clinging to its
branches

And then those who watched him from the barge and shore said afterwards
that a great apathy seemed to fall upon him He no longer attempted to
guide the boat or struggle with the drift but sat in the stern with
intent forward gaze and motionless paddles Once they strove to warn
him called to him to make an effort to reach the barge and did what
they could in spite of their own peril to alter their course and help
him But he neither answered nor heeded them And then suddenly a great
log that they had just escaped seemed to rise up under the keel of his
boat and it was gone After a moment his face and head appeared above
the current and so close to the stern of the barge that there was a
slight cry from the woman in it but the next moment and before the
boatman could reach him he was drawn under it and disappeared They lay
on their oars eagerly watching but the body of James Smith was sucked
under the barge and in the midchannel of the great river was carried
out towards the distant sea




There was a strange meeting that night on the deck of a relief boat
which had been sent out in search of the missing barge between Mrs
Smith and a grave and anxious passenger who had chartered it When
he had comforted her and pointed out as indeed he had many times
before the loneliness and insecurity of her unprotected life she
yielded to his arguments But it was not until many months after their
marriage that she confessed to him on that eventful night she thought
she had seen in a moment of great peril the vision of the dead face of
her husband uplifted to her through the water




LANTY FOSTERS MISTAKE


Lanty Foster was crouching on a low stool before the dying kitchen
fire the better to get its fading radiance on the book she was reading
Beyond through the open window and door the fire was also slowly
fading from the sky and the mountain ridge whence the sun had dropped
half an hour before The view was uphill and the skyline of the
hill was marked by two or three gibbetlike poles from which on a
now invisible line between them depended certain objectsmere black
silhouettes against the skywhich bore weird likeness to human figures
Absorbed as she was in her book she nevertheless occasionally cast an
impatient glance in that direction as the sunlight faded more quickly
than her fire For the fluttering objects were the weeks wash which
had to be brought in before night fell and the mountain wind arose It
was strong at that altitude and before this had ravished the clothes
from the line and scattered them along the highroad leading over the
ridge once even lashing the shy schoolmaster with a pair of Lantys own
stockings and blinding the parson with a really tempestuous petticoat

A whiff of wind down the bigthroated chimney stirred the log embers on
the hearth and the girl jumped to her feet closing the book with an
impatient snap She knew her mothers voice would follow It was hard to
leave her heroine at the crucial moment of receiving an explanation from
a presumed faithless lover just to climb a hill and take in a lot
of soulless washing but such are the infelicities of stolen romance
reading She threw the clothesbasket over her head like a hood the
handle resting across her bosom and shoulders and with both her hands
free started out of the cabin But the darkness had come up from the
valley in one stride after its mountain fashion had outstripped her
and she was instantly plunged in it Still the outline of the ridge
above her was visible with the white steadfast stars that were not
there a moment ago and by that sign she knew she was late She had to
battle against the rushing wind now which sung through the inverted
basket over her head and held her back but with bent shoulders she at
last reached the top of the ridge and the level Yet here owing to
the shifting of the lighter background above her she now found herself
again encompassed with the darkness The outlines of the poles had
disappeared the white fluttering garments were distinct apparitions
waving in the wind like dancing ghosts But there certainly was a queer
misshapen bulk moving beyond which she did not recognize and as she at
last reached one of the poles a shock was communicated to it through
the clothesline and the bulk beyond Then she heard a voice say
impatiently

What in hll am I running into now

It was a mans voice and from its elevation the voice of a man on
horseback She answered without fear and with slow deliberation

Inter our clothesline I reckon

Oh said the man in a halfapologetic tone Then in brisker accents
The very thing I want I say can you give me a bit of it The ring of
my saddle girth has fetched loose I can fasten it with that

I reckon replied Lanty with the same unconcern moving nearer the
bulk which now separated into two parts as the man dismounted How
much do you want

A foot or two will do

They were now in front of each other although their faces were not
distinguishable to either Lanty who had been following the lines with
her hand here came upon the end knotted around the last pole This she
began to untie

What a place to hang clothes he said curiously

Mighty dryin tho returned Lanty laconically

And your house Is it near by he continued

Just down the ridgeye kin see from the edge Got a knife She had
untied the knot

Noyeswait He had hesitated a moment and then produced something
from his breast pocket which he however kept in his hand As he did not
offer it to her she simply held out a section of the rope between
her hands which he divided with a single cut She saw only that the
instrument was long and keen Then she lifted the flap of the saddle
for him as he attempted to fasten the loose ring with the rope but
the darkness made it impossible With an ejaculation he fumbled in his
pockets My last match he said striking it as he crouched over
it to protect it from the wind Lanty leaned over also with her apron
raised between it and the blast The flame for an instant lit up the
ring the mans dark face mustache and white teeth set together as
he tugged at the girth and Lantys brown velvet eyes and soft round
cheek framed in the basket Then it went out but the ring was secured

Thank you said the man with a short laugh but I thought you were a
humpbacked witch in the dark there

And I couldnt make out whether you was a cow or a bar returned the
young girl simply

Here however he quickly mounted his horse but in the action something
slipped from his clothes struck a stone and bounded away into the
darkness

My knife he said hurriedly Please hand it to me But although the
girl dropped on her knees and searched the ground diligently it could
not be found The man with a restrained ejaculation again dismounted
and joined in the search

Havent you got another match suggested Lanty

Noit was my last he said impatiently

Just you hol on here she said suddenly and Ill run down to the
kitchen and fetch you a light I wont be long

No no said the man quickly dont I couldnt wait Ive been here
too long now Look here You come in daylight and find it andjust
keep it for me will you He laughed Ill come for it And now if
youll only help to set me on that road again for its so infernal
black I cant see the mares ears ahead of me I wont bother you any
more Thank you

Lanty had quietly moved to his horses head and taken the bridle in her
hand and at once seemed to be lost in the gloom But in a few moments
he felt the muffled thud of his horses hoof on the thick dust of the
highway and its still hot impalpable powder rising to his nostrils

Thank you he said again Im all right now and in the pause that
followed it seemed to Lanty that he had extended a parting hand to her
in the darkness She put up her own to meet it but missed his which
had blundered onto her shoulder Before she could grasp it she felt him
stooping over her the light brush of his soft mustache on her cheek
and then the starting forward of his horse But the retaliating box on
the ear she had promptly aimed at him spent itself in the black space
which seemed suddenly to have swallowed up the man and even his light
laugh

For an instant she stood still and then swinging the basket
indignantly from her shoulder took up her suspended task It was no
light one in the increasing wind and the unfastened clothesline had
precipitated a part of its burden to the ground through the loosening
of the rope But on picking up the trailing garments her hand struck an
unfamiliar object The strangers lost knife She thrust it hastily into
the bottom of the basket and completed her work As she began to descend
with her burden she saw that the light of the kitchen fire seen
through the windows was augmented by a candle Her mother was evidently
awaiting her

Pretty time to be fetchin in the wash said Mrs Foster querulously
But what can you expect when folks stand gossipin and philanderin on
the ridge instead o tendin to their work

Now Lanty knew that she had NOT been gossipin nor philanderin yet
as the parting salute might have been open to that imputation and as
she surmised that her mother might have overheard their voices she
briefly said to prevent further questioning that she had shown a
stranger the road But for her mothers unjust accusation she would have
been more communicative As Mrs Foster went back grumblingly into the
sittingroom Lanty resolved to keep the knife at present a secret from
her mother and to that purpose removed it from the basket But in the
light of the candle she saw it for the first time plainlyand started

For it was really a dagger jeweledhandled and richly wroughtsuch as
Lanty had never looked upon before The hilt was studded with gems and
the blade which had a cutting edge was damascened in blue and
gold Her soft eyes reflected the brilliant setting her lips parted
breathlessly then as her mothers voice arose in the other room she
thrust it back into its velvet sheath and clapped it into her pocket
Its rare beauty had confirmed her resolution of absolute secrecy To
have shown it now would have made no end of talk And she was not sure
but that her parents would have demanded its custody And it was given
to HER by HIM to keep This settled the question of moral ethics She
took the first opportunity to run up to her bedroom and hide it under
the mattress

Yet the thought of it filled the rest of her evening When her household
duties were done she took up her novel again partly from force of habit
and partly as an attitude in which she could think of IT undisturbed
For what was fiction to her now True it possessed a certain
reminiscent value A dagger had appeared in several romances she
had devoured but she never had a clear idea of one before The Count
sprang back and drawing from his belt a richly jeweled dagger hissed
between his teeth or more to the purpose Take this said Orlando
handing her the rubyhilted poignard which had gleamed upon his thigh
and should the caitiff attempt thy unguarded innocence

Did ye hear what your father was sayin Lanty started It was her
mothers voice in the doorway and she had been vaguely conscious of
another voice pitched in the same querulous key which indeed was the
dominant expression of the small ranchers of that fertile neighborhood
Possibly a too complaisant and unaggressive Nature had spoiled them

Yesno said Lanty abstractedly what did he say

If you wasnt taken up with that fool book said Mrs Foster glancing
at her daughters slightly conscious color yed know He allowed
yed better not leave yer filly in the far pasture nights That gang
o Mexican horsethieves is out again and raided McKinnons stock last
night

This touched Lanty closely The filly was her own property and she
was breaking it for her own riding But her distrust of her parents
interference was greater than any fear of horsestealers Shes mighty
uneasy in the barn and she added with a proud consciousness of that
beautiful yet carnal weapon upstairs I reckon I ken protect her and
myself agin any Mexican horsethieves

My but were gettin high and mighty responded Mrs Foster with
deep irony Did you git all that outer your fool book

Mebbe said Lanty curtly

Nevertheless her thoughts that night were not entirely based on written
romance She wondered if the stranger knew that she had really tried to
box his ears in the darkness also if he had been able to see her face
HIS she remembered at least the flash of his white teeth against his
dark face and darker mustache which was quite as soft as her own hair
But if he thought for a minnit that she was goin to allow an entire
stranger to kiss herhe was mighty mistaken She should let him know
it pretty quick She should hand him back the dagger quite careless
like and never let on that shed thought anything of it Perhaps that
was the reason why before she went to bed she took a good look at it
and after taking off her straight beltless calico gown she even tried
the effect of it thrust in the stiff waistband of her petticoat with
the jeweled hilt displayed and thought it looked charmingas indeed it
did And then having said her prayers like a good girl and supplicated
that she should be less tetchy with her parents she went to sleep and
dreamed that she had gone out to take in the wash again but that the
clothes had all changed to the queerest lot of folks who were all
fighting and struggling with each other until she Lanty drawing her
dagger rushed up singlehanded among them crying Disperse ye craven
cursdisperse I say And they dispersed

Yet even Lanty was obliged to admit the next morning that all this was
somewhat incongruous with the baking of corn dodgers the frying of
fish the making of beds and her other household duties and dismissed
the stranger from her mind until he should happen along In her freer
and more acceptable outdoor duties she even tolerated the advances of
neighboring swains who made a point of passing by Fosters Ranch and
who were quite aware that Atalanta Foster alias Lanty was one of the
prettiest girls in the country But Lantys toleration consisted in that
singular performance known to herself as giving them as good as they
sent being a lazy traversing qualified with scorn of all that they
advanced How long they would have put up with this from a plain girl I
do not know but Lantys short upper lip seemed framed for indolent
and fascinating scorn and her dreamy eyes usually looked beyond the
questioner or blunted his bolder glances in their velvety surfaces The
libretto of these scenes was not exhaustive eg

The Swain with bold bad gayety Saw that shy schoolmaster hangin
round your ridge yesterday Orter know by this time that shyness with a
gal dont pay

Lanty decisively Mebbe he allows it dont get left as often as
impudence

The Swain ignoring the reply and his previous attitude and becoming
more direct I was calkilatin to say that with these yer hossthieves
about yer filly aint safe in the pasture I took a turn round there
two or three times last evening to see if she was all right

Lanty with a flattering show of interest No DID ye now I was jest
wonderin

The Swain eagerly I didquite late too Why thats nothin Miss
Atalanty to what Id do for you

Lanty musing with far offeyes Then thats why she was so awful
skeerd and frightened Just jumpin outer her skin with horror I
reckoned it was a bar or panther or a spook You ought to have waited
till she got accustomed to your looks

Nevertheless despite this elegant raillery Lanty was enough concerned
in the safety of her horse to visit it the next day with a view of
bringing it nearer home She had just stepped into the alder fringe of
a dry run when she came suddenly upon the figure of a horseman in the
run who had been hidden by the alders from the plain beyond and who
seemed to be engaged in examining the hoof marks in the dust of the
old ford Something about his figure struck her recollection and as
he looked up quickly she saw it was the owner of the dagger But
he appeared to be lighter of hair and complexion and was dressed
differently and more like a vaquero Yet there was the same flash of
his teeth as he recognized her and she knew it was the same man

Alas for her preparation Without the knife she could not make that
haughty return of it which she had contemplated And more than that she
was conscious she was blushing Nevertheless she managed to level her
pretty brown eyebrows at him and said sharply that if he followed her
to her home she would return his property at once

But Im in no hurry for it he said with a laughthe same light
laugh and pleasant voice she rememberedand Id rather not come to
the house just now The knife is in good hands I know and Ill call
for it when I want it And until thenif its all the same to youkeep
it to yourselfkeep it dark as dark as the night I lost it

I dont go about blabbing my affairs said Lanty indignantly and if
it hadnt BEEN dark that night youd have had your ears boxedyou know
why

The stranger laughed again waved his hand to Lanty and galloped away

Lanty was a little disappointed The daylight had taken away some of
her illusions He was certainly very goodlooking but not quite as
picturesque mysterious and thrilling as in the dark And it was very
queerhe certainly did look darker that night Who was he And why
was he lingering near her He was different from her neighborsher
admirers He might be one of those locaters from the big towns who
prospect the lands with a view of settling government warrants on
themthey were always so secret until they had found what they wanted
She did not dare to seek information of her friends for the same reason
that she had concealed his existence from her motherit would provoke
awkward questions and it was evident that he was trusting to her
secrecy too The thought thrilled her with a new pride and was some
compensation for the loss of her more intangible romance It would
be mighty fine when he did call openly for his beautiful knife and
declared himself to have them all know that SHE knew about it all
along

When she reached home to guard against another such surprise she
determined to keep the weapon with her and distrusting her pocket
confided it to the cheap little countrymade corset which only for
the last year had confined her budding figure and which now perhaps
heaved with an additional pride She was quite abstracted during the
rest of the day and paid but little attention to the gossip of the farm
lads who were full of a daring raid two nights before by the Mexican
gang on the large stock farm of a neighbor The Vigilant Committee had
been baffled it was even alleged that some of the smaller ranchmen
and herders were in league with the gang It was also believed to be a
widespread conspiracy to have a political complexion in its combination
of an alien race with Southwestern filibusters The legal authorities
had been reinforced by special detectives from San Francisco Lanty
seldom troubled herself with these matters she knew the exaggeration
she suspected the ignorance of her rural neighbors She roughly referred
it in her own vocabulary to jaw a peculiarly masculine quality But
later in the evening when the domestic circle in the sittingroom had
been augmented by a neighbor and Lanty had taken refuge behind her
novel as an excuse for silence Zob Hopper the enamored swain of the
previous evening burst in with more astounding news A posse of the
sheriff had just passed along the ridge they had corraled part of the
gang and rescued some of the stock The leader of the gang had escaped
but his capture was inevitable as the roads were stopped All the
same Im glad to see ye took my advice Miss Atalanty and brought in
your filly he concluded with an insinuating glance at the young girl

But Miss Atalanty curling a quarter of an inch of scarlet lip above
the edge of her novel here allowed that if his advice or the filly
had to be took she didnt know which was worse

I wonder ye kin talk to sech peartness Mr Hopper said Mrs Foster
severely she aint got eyes nor senses for anythin but that book

Talkin o whats to be took put in the diplomatic neighbor you
bet it aint that Mexican leader No sir hes been stopped before
thisand then got clean away all the same One o them detectives got
him once and disarmed himbut he managed to give them the slip after
all Why hes that full o shifts and disguises thar aint no spottin
him He walked right under the constables nose oncet and took a drink
with the sheriff that was arter himand the blamed fool never knew it
He kin change even the color of his hair quick as winkin

Is he a real Mexicana regular Greaser asked the paternal Foster
Cos I never heard that they wuz smart

No They say he comes o old Spanish stock a bad egg they threw outer
the nest I reckon put in Hopper eagerly seeing a strange animated
interest dilating Lantys eyes and hoping to share in it but hes
reglar hightoned you bet Why I knew a man who seed him in his own
campprinked out in a velvet jacket and silk sash with gold chains
and buttons down his wide pants and a dagger stuck in his sash with a
handle just blazin with jewls Yes Miss Atalanty they say that one
stone at the topa green stone what they call an emralwas worth
the price o a Frisco houselot True ez you live Ehwhats up now

Lantys book had fallen on the floor as she was rising to her feet
with a white face still more strange and distorted in an affected yawn
behind her little hand Yer makin me that sick and nervous with yer
fool yarns she said hysterically that Im goin to get a little
fresh air Its just stifling here with lies and terbacker With
another high laugh she brushed past him into the kitchen opened the
door and then paused and turning ran rapidly up to her bedroom Here
she locked herself in tore open the bosom of her dress plucked out
the dagger threw it on the bed where the green stone gleamed for an
instant in the candlelight and then dropped on her knees beside the bed
with her whirling head buried in her cold red hands

It had all come to her in a flash like a blaze of lightningthe
black haunting figure on the ridge the broken saddle girth the
abandonment of the dagger in the exigencies of flight and concealment
the second meeting the skulking in the dry alderhidden run the
changed dress the lightercolored hair but always the same voice and
laughthe leader the fugitive the Mexican horsethief And she the
Godforsaken fool the chuckleheaded nigger baby with not half the
sense of her own filly or that sopheaded Hopperhad never seen it
SheSHE who would be the laughingstock of them allshe had thought
him a locater a towny from Frisco And she had consented to keep
his knife until he would call for ityes call for it with fire and
flame perhaps the trampling of hoofs pistol shotsandyet

Yethe had TRUSTED her Yes trusted her when he knew a word from her
lips would have brought the whole district down on him when the mere
exposure of that dagger would have identified and damned him Trusted
her a second time when she was within cry of her house When he might
have taken her filly without her knowing it And now she remembered
vaguely that the neighbors had said how strange it was that her fathers
stock had not suffered as theirs had HE had protected themhe who was
now a fugitiveand their men pursuing him She rose suddenly with a
single stamp of her narrow foot and as suddenly became cool and sane
And then quite her old self again she lazily picked up the dagger and
restored it to its place in her bosom That done with her color back
and her eyes a little brighter she deliberately went downstairs again
stuck her little brown head into the sittingroom said cheerfully
Still yawpin you folks and quietly passed out into the darkness

She ran swiftly up to the ridge impelled by the blind memory of having
met him there at night and the one vague thought to give him warning
But it was dark and empty with no sound but the rushing wind And then
an idea seized her If he were haunting the vicinity still he might see
the fluttering of the clothes upon the line and believe she was there
She stooped quickly and in the merciful and exonerating darkness
stripped off her only white petticoat and pinned it on the line It
flapped fluttered and streamed in the mountain wind She lingered and
listened But there came a sound she had not counted onthe clattering
hoofs of not ONE but many horses on the lower road She ran back to
the house to find its inmates already hastening towards the road for
news She took that chance to slip in quietly go to her room whose
window commanded a view of the ridge and crouching low behind it she
listened She could hear the sound of voices and the dull trampling of
heavy boots on the dusty path towards the barnyard on the other side of
the housea pause and then the return of the trampling boots and the
final clattering of hoofs on the road again Then there was a tap on her
door and her mothers querulous voice

Oh yer there are ye Wellits the best place fer a girlwith all
these mans doins goin on Theyve got that Mexican horsethief and
have tied him up in your fillys stall in the barntill the Frisco
deputy gets back from rounding up the others So ye jest stay where ye
are till theyve come and gone and were shut o all that cattle Are
ye mindin

All right maw taint no call o mine anyhow returned Lanty
through the halfopen door

At another time her mother might have been startled at her passive
obedience Still more would she have been startled had she seen her
daughters face now behind the closed doorwith her little mouth set
over her clenched teeth And yet it was her own child and Lanty was her
mothers real daughter the same pioneer blood filled their veins the
blood that had never nourished cravens or degenerates but had given
itself to sprinkle and fertilize desert solitudes where man might
follow Small wonder then that this frontierborn Lanty whose first
infant cry had been answered by the yelp of wolf and scream of panther
whose fathers rifle had been leveled across her cradle to cover the
stealthy Indian who prowled outside small wonder that she should feel
herself equal to these mans doins and prompt to take a part For
even in the first shock of the news of the capture she recalled the
fact that the barn was old and rotten that only that day the filly
had kicked a board loose from behind her stall which she Lanty
had lightly returned to avoid making a fuss If his captors had not
noticed it or trusted only to their guards she might make the opening
wide enough to free him

Two hours later the guard nearest the now sleeping house a farm hand
of the Fosters saw his employers daughter slip out and cautiously
approach him A devoted slave of Lantys and familiar with her
impulses he guessed her curiosity and was not averse to satisfy it
and the sense of his own importance To her whispers of affected
halfterrified interest he responded in whispers that the captive was
really in the fillys stall securely bound by his wrists behind his
back and his feet hobbled to a post That Lanty couldnt see him for
it was dark inside and he was sitting with his back to the wall as he
couldnt sleep comfble lyin down Lantys eyes glowed but her face
was turned aside

And ye aint reckonin his friends will come and rescue him said
Lanty gazing with affected fearfulness in the darkness

Not much Theres two other guards down in the corral and Id fire my
gun and bring em up

But Lanty was gazing openmouthed towards the ridge Whats that wavin
on the ridge she said in awestricken tones

She was pointing to the petticoata vague distant moving object
against the horizon

Why thats some o the wash on the line aint it

WashTWO DAYS IN THE WEEK said Lanty sharply Wots gone of you

Thets so muttered the man and it want there at sundown Ill
swear Praps Id better call the guard and he raised his rifle

Dont said Lanty catching his arm Suppose its nothin theyll
laugh at ye Creep up softly and see ye aint afraid are ye If ye
are give me yer gun and ILL go

This settled the question as Lanty expected The man cocked his piece
and bending low began cautiously to mount the acclivity Lanty waited
until his figure began to fade and then ran like fire to the barn

She had arranged every detail of her plan beforehand Crouching beside
the wall of the stall she hissed through a crack in thrilling whispers
Dont move Dont speak for your lifes sake Wait till I hand you back
your knife then do the best you can Then slipping aside the loosened
board she saw dimly the black outline of curling hair back shoulders
and tied wrists of the captive Drawing the knife from her pocket with
two strokes of its keen cutting edge she severed the cords threw the
knife into the opening and darted away Yet in that moment she knew
that the man was instinctively turning towards her But it was one thing
to free a horsethief and another to stop and philander with him

She ran halfway up the ridge and met the farm hand returning It was
only a bit of washing after all and he was glad he hadnt fired his
gun On the other hand Lanty confessed she had got so skeert being
alone that she came to seek him She had the shivers wasnt her
hand cold It was but thrilling even in its coldness to the bashfully
admiring man And she was that weak and dizzy he must let her lean on
his arm going down and they must go SLOW She was sure he was cold
too and if he would wait at the back door she would give him a drink of
whiskey Thus Lanty with her brain afire her eyes and ears straining
into the darkness and the vague outline of the barn beyond Another
moment was protracted over the drink of whiskey and then Lanty with a
faint archness made him promise not to tell her mother of her escapade
and she promised on her part not to say anything about his stalking
a petticoat on the clothesline and then shyly closed the door and
regained her room HE must have got away by this time or have been
discovered she believed they would not open the barn door until the
return of the posse

She was right It was near daybreak when they returned and again
crouching low beside her window she heard with a fierce joy the
sudden outcry the oaths the wrangling voices the summoning of her
father to the front door and then the tumultuous sweeping away again of
the whole posse and a blessed silence falling over the rancho And then
Lanty went quietly to bed and slept like a threeyear child

Perhaps that was the reason why she was able at breakfast to listen with
lazy and even rosy indifference to the startling events of the night to
the sneers of the farm hands at the posse who had overlooked the knife
when they searched their prisoner as well as the stupidity of the
corral guard who had never heard him make a hole the size of a house
in the barn side Once she glanced demurely at Silas Briggsthe farm
hand and the poor fellow felt consoled in his shame at the remembrance
of their confidences

But Lantys tranquillity was not destined to last long There was again
the irruption of exciting news from the highroad the Mexican leader had
been recaptured and was now safely lodged in Brownsville jail Those
who were previously loud in their praises of the successful horsethief
who had baffled the vigilance of his pursuers were now equally keen
in their admiration of the new San Francisco deputy who in turn had
outwitted the whole gang It was HE who was fertile in expedients HE
who had studied the whole country and even risked his life among the
gang and HE who had again closed the meshes of the net around the
escaped outlaw He was already returning by way of the rancho and might
stop there a momentso that they could all see the hero Such was the
power of success on the countryside Outwardly indifferent inwardly
bitter Lanty turned away She should not grace his triumph if she kept
in her room all day And when there was a clatter of hoofs on the road
again Lanty slipped upstairs

But in a few moments she was summoned Captain Lance Wetherby Assistant
Chief of Police of San Francisco Deputy Sheriff and exU S scout
had requested to see Miss Foster a few moments alone Lanty knew what
it meanther secret had been discovered but she was not the girl to
shirk the responsibility She lifted her little brown head proudly and
with the same resolute step with which she had left the house the night
before descended the stairs and entered the sittingroom At first she
saw nothing Then a remembered voice struck her ear she started looked
up and gasping fell back against the door It was the stranger who
had given her the dagger the stranger she had met in the runthe
horsethief himself No no she saw it all nowshe had cut loose the
wrong man

He looked at her with a smile of sadnessas he drew from his
breastpocket that dreadful dagger the very sight of which Lanty now
loathed This is the SECOND time Miss Foster he said gently that
I have taken this knife from Murietta the Mexican bandit once when I
disarmed him three weeks ago and he escaped and last night when he
had again escaped and I recaptured him After I lost it that night I
understood from you that you had found it and were keeping it for me
He paused a moment and went on I dont ask you what happened last
night I dont condemn you for it I can believe what a girl of your
courage and sympathy might rightly do if her pity were excited I only
askwhy did you give HIM back that knife I trusted you with

Why Why did I burst out Lanty in a daring gush of truth scorn and
temper BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE THAT HORSETHIEF There

He drew back astonished and then suddenly came that laugh that Lanty
remembered and now hailed with joy I believe you by Jove he gasped
That first night I wore the disguise in which I have tracked him and
mingled with his gang Yes I see it all nowand more I see that to
YOU I owe his recapture

To me echoed the bewildered girl how

Why instead of making for his cave he lingered here in the confines of
the ranch He thought you were in love with him because you freed him
and gave him his knife and stayed to see you

But Lanty had her apron to her eyes whose first tears were filling
their velvet depths And her voice was broken as she said

Then hecaredagood deal more for methan some people

But there is every reason to believe that Lanty was wrong At least
later events that are part of the history of Fosters Rancho and the
Foster family pointed distinctly to the contrary




AN ALI BABA OF THE SIERRAS


Johnny Starleigh found himself again late for school It was always
happening It seemed to be inevitable with the process of going to
school at all And it was no fault o his Something was always
occurringsome eccentricity of Nature or circumstance was invariably
starting up in his daily path to the schoolroom He may not have been
thinkin of squirrels and yet the rarest and most evasive of that
species were always crossing his trail he may not have been huntin
honey and yet a wild bees nest in the hollow of an oak absolutely
obtruded itself before him he wasnt birdcatchin and yet there was
a yellowhammer always within stones throw He had heard how grown men
hunters always saw the most wonderful animals when they hadnt got
a gun with em and it seemed to be his lot to meet them in his
restricted possibilities on the way to school If Nature was thus
capricious with his elders why should folk think it strange if she was
as mischievous with a small boy

On this particular morning Johnny had been beguiled by the unmistakable
footprintsso like his ownof a bears cub What chances he had of
ever coming up with them or what he would have done if he had he did
not know He only knew that at the end of an hour and a half he found
himself two miles from the schoolhouse and from the position of the
sun at least an hour too late for school He knew that nobody would
believe him The punishment for complete truancy was little worse than
for being late He resolved to accept it and by way of irrevocability
at once burnt his ships behind himin devouring part of his dinner

Thus fortified in his outlawry he began to look about him He was on a
thickly wooded terrace with a blank wall of outcrop on one side nearly
as high as the pines which pressed close against it He had never seen
it before it was two or three miles from the highroad and seemed to be
a virgin wilderness But on close examination he could see with the
eye of a boy bred in a mining district that the wall of outcrop had not
escaped the attention of the mining prospector There were marks of his
pick in some attractive quartz seams of the wall and farther on a more
ambitious attempt evidently by a party of miners to begin a tunnel
shown in an abandoned excavation and the heap of debris before it It
had evidently been abandoned for some time as ferns already forced
their green fronds through the stones and gravel and the yerba buena
vine was beginning to mat the surface of the heap But the boys fancy
was quickly taken by the traces of a singular accident and one which
had perhaps arrested the progress of the excavators The roots of a
large pinetree growing close to the wall had been evidently loosened by
the excavators and the tree had fallen with one of its largest roots
still in the opening the miners had made and apparently blocking the
entrance The large tree lay as it fellmidway across another but much
smaller outcrop of rock which stood sharply about fifteen feet above
the level of the terracewith its gaunt dead limbs in the air at a low
angle To Johnnys boyish fancy it seemed so easily balanced on the rock
that but for its imprisoned root it would have made a capital seesaw
This he felt must be looked to hereafter But here his attention was
arrested by something more alarming His quick ear attuned like an
animals to all woodland sounds detected the crackling of underwood
in the distance His equally sharp eye saw the figures of two men
approaching But as he recognized the features of one of them he drew
back with a beating heart a hushed breath and hurriedly hid himself in
the shadow For he had seen that figure once beforeflying before
the sheriff and an armed posseand had never forgotten it It was the
figure of Spanish Pete a notorious desperado and sluice robber

Finding he had been unobserved the boy took courage and his
small faculties became actively alive The two men came on together
cautiously and at a little distance the second man whom Johnny did not
know parted from his companion and began to loiter up and down looking
around as if acting as a sentinel for the desperado who advanced
directly to the fallen tree Suddenly the sentinel uttered an
exclamation and Spanish Pete paused The sentinel was examining the
ground near the heap of debris

Whats up growled the desperado

Foot tracks Werent here before And fresh ones too

Johnnys heart sank It was where he had just passed

Spanish Pete hurriedly joined his companion

Foot tracks be  he said scornfully What fool would be crawlin
round here barefooted Its a young bar

Johnny knew the footprints were his own Yet he recognized the truth
of the resemblance it was uncomplimentary but he felt relieved The
desperado came forward and to the boys surprise began to climb the
small ridge of outcrop until he reached the fallen tree Johnny saw that
he was carrying a heavy stone Whats the blamed fool goin to do he
said to himself the mans evident ignorance regarding footprints
had lessened the boys awe of him But the strangers next essay took
Johnnys breath away Standing on the fallen tree trunk at its axis on
the outcrop he began to rock it gently To Johnnys surprise it
began to move The upper end descended slowly lifting the root in the
excavation at the lower end and with it a mass of rock and revealing a
cavern behind large enough to admit a man Johnny gasped The desperado
coolly deposited the heavy stone on the tree beyond its axis on the
rock so that it would keep the tree in position leaped from the tree
to the rock and quickly descended at which he was joined by the
other man who was carrying two heavy chamoisleather bags They both
proceeded to the opening thus miraculously disclosed and disappeared in
it

Johnny sat breathless wondering expectant but not daring to move The
men might come out at any moment he had seen enough to know that their
enterprise as well as their cave was a secret and that the desperado
would subject any witness to it however innocent or unwilling to
horrible penalties The time crept slowly byhe heard every rap of a
woodpecker in a distant tree a blue jay dipped and lighted on a branch
within his reach but he dared not extend his hand his legs were
infested by ants he even fancied he heard the dry hollow rattle of a
rattlesnake not a yard from him And then the entrance of the cave
was darkened and the two men reappeared Johnny stared He would have
rubbed his eyes if he had dared They were not the same men Did the
cave contain others who had been all the while shut up in its dark
recesses Was there a band Would they all swarm out upon him Should he
run for his life

But the illusion was only momentary A longer look at them convinced
him that they were the same men in new clothes and disguised and as one
remounted the outcrop Johnnys keen eyes recognized him as Spanish Pete
He merely kicked away the stone the root again descended gently over
the opening and the tree recovered its former angle The two hurried
away but Johnny noticed that they were emptyhanded The bags had been
left behind

The boy waited patiently listening with his ear to the ground like an
Indian for the last rustle of fern and crackle of underbrush and
then emerged stiff and cramped from his concealment But he no longer
thought of flight curiosity and ambition burned in his small veins He
quickly climbed up the outcrop picked up the fallen stone and in spite
of its weight lifted it to the prostrate tree Here he paused and from
his coign of vantage looked and listened The solitude was profound
Then mounting the tree and standing over its axis he tried to rock it as
the others had Alas Johnnys heart was stout his courage unlimited
his perception allembracing his ambition boundless but his actual
avoirdupois was only that of a boy of ten The tree did not move But
Johnny had played seesaw before and quietly moved towards its highest
part It slowly descended under the changed centre of gravity and the
root arose disclosing the opening as before Yet here the little hero
paused He waited with his eyes fixed on the opening ready to fly on
the sallying out of any one who had remained concealed He then placed
the stone where he had stood leaped down and ran to the opening

The change from the dazzling sunlight to the darkness confused him at
first and he could see nothing On entering he stumbled over something
which proved to be a bottle in which a candle was fitted and a box of
matches evidently used by the two men Lighting the candle he could now
discern that the cavern was only a few yards long the beginning of a
tunnel which the accident to the tree had stopped In one corner lay the
clothes that the men had left and which for a moment seemed all that
the cavern contained but on removing them Johnny saw that they were
thrown over a rifle a revolver and the two chamoisleather bags
that the men had brought there They were so heavy that the boy
could scarcely lift them His face flushed his hands trembled with
excitement To a boy whose truant wanderings had given him a fair
knowledge of mining he knew that weight could have but one meaning
Gold He hurriedly untied the nearest bag But it was not the gold of
the locality of the tunnel of the bed rock It was flake gold
the gold of the river It had been taken from the miners sluices in
the distant streams The bags before him were the spoils of the sluice
robberspoils that could not be sold or even shown in the district
without danger spoils kept until they could be taken to Marysville or
Sacramento for disposal All this might have occurred to the mind of any
boy of the locality who had heard the common gossip of his elders but
to Johnnys fancy an idea was kindled peculiarly his own Here was a
cavern like that of the Forty Thieves in the story book and he was
the Ali Baba who knew its secret He was not obliged to say Open
Sesame but he could say it if he liked if he was showing it off to
anybody

Yet alas he also knew it was a secret he must keep to himself He had
nobody to trust it to His father was a charcoalburner of small means
a widower with two children Johnny and his elder brother Sam The
latter a flagrant incorrigible of twentytwo with a tendency to
dissipation and low company had lately abandoned his fathers roof
only to reappear at intervals of hilarious or maudlin intoxication
He had always been held up to Johnny as a warning or with the gloomy
prognosis that he Johnny was already following in his tortuous
footsteps Even if he were here he was not to be thought of as a
confidant Still less could he trust his father who would be sure to
bungle the secret with sheriffs and constables and end by bringing down
the vengeance of the gang upon the family As for himself he could not
dispose of the gold if he were to take it The exhibition of a single
flake of it to the adult public would arouse suspicion and as it was
Johnnys hard fate to be always doubted he might be connected with the
gang As a truant he knew he had no moral standing but he also had
the superstitionquite characteristic of childhoodthat being in
possession of a secret he was a participant in its criminalityand
bound as it were by terrible oaths And then a new idea seized him
He carefully put back everything as he had found it extinguished the
candle left the cave remounted the tree and closed the opening again
as he had seen the others do it with the addition of murmuring Shut
Sesame to himself and then ran away as fast as his short legs could
carry him

Well clear of the dangerous vicinity he proceeded more leisurely for
about a mile until he came to a low whitewashed fence inclosing a
small cultivated patch and a neat farmhouse beyond Here he paused
and cowering behind the fence with extraordinary facial contortions
produced a cry not unlike the scream of a blue jay Repeating it at
intervals he was presently relieved by observing the approach of a
nankeen sunbonnet within the inclosure above the line of fence Stopping
before him the sunbonnet revealed a rosy little face more than
usually plump on one side and a neck enormously wrapped in a scarf It
was Meely Amelia Stryker a schoolmate detained at home by mumps
as Johnny was previously aware For with the famous indiscretion of
some other great heroes he was about to intrust his secret and his
destiny to one of the weaker sex And what were the minor possibilities
of contagion to this

Playin hookey agin said the young lady with a cordial and even
expansive smile exclusively confined to one side of her face

Um Sod you be ef youd bin whar I hev he said with harrowing
mystery

Nosay said Meely eagerly

At which Johnny clutching at the top of the fence with hurried breath
told his story But not all With the instinct of a true artist he
withheld the manner in which the opening of the cave was revealed said
nothing about the tree and I grieve to say added the words Open
Sesame as the important factor to the operation Neither did he mention
the name of Spanish Pete For all of which he was afterwards duly
grateful

Meet me at the burnt pine down the crossroads at four oclock he said
in conclusion and Ill show ye

Why not now said Meely impatiently

Couldnt Much as my life is worth Must keep watching out You come at
four

And with an assuring nod he released the fence and trotted off He
returned cautiously in the direction of the cave he was by no means
sure that the robbers might not return that day and his mysterious
rendezvous with Meely veiled a certain prudence And it was well For as
he stealthily crept around the face of the outcrop hidden in the ferns
he saw from the altered angle of the tree that the cavern was opened
He remained motionless with bated breath Then he heard the sound of
subdued voices from the cavern and a figure emerged from the opening
Johnny grasped the ferns rigidly to check the dreadful cry that rose to
his lips at its sight For that figure was his own brother

There was no mistaking that weak wicked face even then flushed with
liquor Johnny had seen it too often thus But never before as a thiefs
face He gave a little gasp and fell back upon that strange reserve of
apathy and reticence in which children are apt to hide their emotions
from us at such a moment He watched impassively the two other men who
followed his brother out to give him a small bag and some instructions
and then returned within their cave while his brother walked quickly
away He watched him disappear he did not move for even if he had
followed him he could not bear to face him in his shame And then out of
his sullen despair came a boyish idea of revenge It was those two men
who had made his brother a thief

He was very near the tree He crept stealthily on his hands and knees
through the bracken and as stealthily climbed the wedge of outcrop
and then leaped like a wild cat on the tree With incredible activity he
lifted the balancing stone and as the tree began to move in a flash
of perception transferred it to the other side of its axis and felt
the roots and debris under that additional weight descend quickly with
something like a crash over the opening Then he took to his heels He
ran so swiftly that all unknowingly he overtook a figure who turning
glanced at him and then disappeared in the wood It was his second and
last view of his brother as he never saw him again

But now strange to say the crucial and most despairing moment of his
days experience had come He had to face Meely Stryker under the burnt
pine and the promise he could not keep and to tell her that he had
lied to her It was the only way to save his brother now His small
wits and alas his smaller methods were equal to the despairing task
As soon as he saw her waiting under the tree he fell to capering and
dancing with an extravagance in which hysteria had no small part Sold
sold sold again and got the money he laughed shrilly

The girl looked at him with astonishment which changed gradually to
scorn and then to anger Johnnys heart sank but he redoubled his
antics

Whos sold she said disdainfully

You be You swallered all that stuff about Ali Baba You wanted to be
Morgy Anna Ho ho And Ive made you play hookeyfrom home

You hateful horrid little liar

Johnny accepted his punishment meeklyin his heart gratefully I
reckoned youd laugh and not get mad he said submissively The girl
turned with tears of rage and vexation in her eyes and walked away
Johnny followed at a humble distance Perhaps there was something
instinctively touching in the boys remorse for they made it up before
they reached her fence

Nevertheless Johnny went home miserable Luckily for him his father was
absent at a Vigilance Committee called to take cognizance of the late
sluice robberies and although this temporarily concealed his offense
of truancy the news of the vigilance meeting determined him to keep
his lips sealed He lay all night wondering how long it would take the
robbers to dig themselves out of the cave and whether they suspected
their imprisonment was the work of an enemy or only an accident For
several days he avoided the locality and even feared the vengeful
appearance of Spanish Pete some night at his fathers house It was
not until the end of a fortnight that he had the courage to revisit the
spot The tree was in its normal position but immovable and a great
quantity of fresh debris at the mouth of the cave convinced him that the
robbers after escaping had abandoned it as unsafe His brother did not
return and either the activity of the Vigilance Committee or the lack
of a new place of rendezvous seemed to have dispersed the robbers from
the locality for they were not heard of again

The next ten years brought an improvement to Mr Starleighs fortunes
Johnny Starleigh then a student at San Jose one morning found a
newspaper clipping in a letter from Miss Amelia Stryker It read as
follows The excavators in the new tunnel in Heavystone Ridge lately
discovered the skeletons of two unknown men who had evidently been
crushed and entombed some years previously by the falling of a large
tree over the mouth of their temporary refuge From some river gold
found with them they were supposed to be part of the gang of sluice
robbers who infested the locality some years ago and were hiding from
the Vigilants

For a few days thereafter Johnny Starleigh was thoughtful and reserved
but he did not refer to the paragraph in answering the letter He
decided to keep it for later confidences when Miss Stryker should
become Mrs Starleigh




MISS PEGGYS PROTEGES


The string of Peggys sunbonnet had become untiedso had her right
shoe These were not unusual accidents to a country girl of ten but as
both of her hands were full she felt obliged to put down what she was
carrying This was further complicated by the nature of her burdena
halffledged shrike and a baby gopherpicked up in her walk It was
impossible to wrap them both in her apron without serious peril to one
or the other she could not put either down without the chance of its
escaping Its like that dreadful riddle of the ferryman who had to
take the wolf and the sheep in his boat said Peggy to herself though
I dont believe anybody was ever so silly as to want to take a wolf
across the river But looking up she beheld the approach of Sam
Bedell a sixfoot tunnelman of the Blue Cement Lead and hailing
him begged him to hold one of her captives The giant loathing the
little mouselike ball of fur chose the shrike Hold him by the feet
for he bites AWFUL said Peggy as the bird regarded Sam with the
diabolically intense frown of his species Then dropping the gopher
unconcernedly in her pocket she proceeded to rearrange her toilet The
tunnelman waited patiently until Peggy had secured the nankeen sunbonnet
around her fresh but freckled cheeks and with a reckless display
of yellow flannel petticoat and stockings like peppermint sticks had
doubleknotted her shoestrings viciously when he ventured to speak

Same old game Peggy Thought youd got rather discouraged with your
happy family arter that new owl o yours had gathered em in

Peggys cheek flushed slightly at this ungracious allusion to a former
collection of hers which had totally disappeared one evening after the
introduction of a new member in the shape of a singularly venerable and
peacefullooking horned owl

I could have tamed HIM too said Peggy indignantly if Ned Myers
who gave him to me hadnt been training him to ketch things and never
let on anything about it to me He was a reglar game owl

And wot are ye goin to do with the Colonel here said Sam indicating
under that gallant title the infant shrike who with his claws deeply
imbedded in Sams finger was squatting like a malignant hunchback and
resisting his transfer to Peggy Wont HE make it rather lively for the
others He looks powful discontented for one so young

Thats his nater said Peggy promptly Jess wait till I tame him
Ef hed been left along o his folks hed grow up like em Hes a
butcher birdwot they call a ninekiller kills nine birds a day
Yes True ez you live Sticks em up on thorns outside his nest jest
like a butchers shop till he gets hungry Ive seen em

And how do you kalkilate to tame him asked Sam

By being good to him and lovin him said Peggy stroking the head of
the bird with infinite gentleness

That means YOUVE got to do all the butchering for him said the
cynical Sam

Peggy shook her head disdaining a verbal reply

Ye cant bring him up on sugar and crackers like a Polly persisted
Sam

Ye ken do anythin with critters if you aint afeerd of em and love
em said Peggy shyly

The tall tunnelman looking down into the depths of Peggys sunbonnet
saw something in the round blue eyes and grave little mouth that made
him think so too But here Peggys serious little face took a shade of
darker concern as her arm went down deeper into her pocket and her eyes
got rounder

ItsitsBURRERED OUT she said breathlessly

The giant leaped briskly to one side Hol on said Peggy
abstractedly With infinite gravity she followed with her fingers a
seam of her skirt down to the hem popped them quickly under it and
produced with a sigh of relief the missing gopher

Youll do said Sam in fearful admiration Mebbe youll make suthin
out o the Colonel too But I never took stock in that there owl He
was too durned selfrighteous for a decent bird Now run along afore
anythin else fetches loose agin So long

He patted the top of her sunbonnet gave a little pull to the short
brown braid that hung behind her temptinglywhich no miner was ever
known to resistand watched her flutter off with her spoils He had
done so many times before for the great foolish heart of the Blue
Cement Ridge had gone out to Peggy Baker the little daughter of the
blacksmith quite early There were others of the family notably
two elder sisters invincible at picnics and dances but Peggy was as
necessary to these men as the blue jay that swung before them in the
dim woods the squirrel that whisked across their morning path or the
woodpecker who beat his tattoo at their midday meal from the hollow
pine above them She was part of the nature that kept them young Her
truancies and vagrancies concerned them not she was a law to herself
like the birds and squirrels There were bearded lips to hail her
wherever she went and a blue or redshirted arm always stretched out in
any perilous pass or dangerous crossing

Her peculiar tastes were an outcome of her nature assisted by her
surroundings Left a good deal to herself in her infancy she made
playfellows of animated nature around her without much reference to
selection or fitness but always with a fearlessness that was the result
of her own observation and unhampered by tradition or other childrens
timidity She had no superstition regarding the venom of toads the
poison of spiders or the earpenetrating capacity of earwigs She had
experiences and revelations of her ownwhich she kept sacredly to
herself as children doand one was in regard to a rattlesnake partly
induced however by the indiscreet warning of her elders She was
cautioned NOT to take her bread and milk into the woods and was told
the affecting story of the little girl who was once regularly visited by
a snake that partook of HER bread and milk and who was ultimately found
rapping the head of the snake for gorging more than his share and not
taking a poon as me do It is needless to say that this incautious
caution fired Peggys adventurous spirit SHE took a bowlful of milk to
the haunt of a rattler near her home but without making the pretense
of sharing it generously left the whole to the reptile After repeating
this hospitality for three or four days she was amazed one morning on
returning to the house to find the snakean elderly one with a dozen
rattlesdevotedly following her Alarmed not for her own safety nor
that of her family but for the existence of her grateful friend in
danger of the blacksmiths hammer she took a circuitous route leading
it away Then recalling a bit of woodland lore once communicated to her
by a charcoalburner she broke a spray of the white ash and laid it
before her in the track of the rattlesnake He stopped instantly and
remained motionless without crossing the slight barrier She repeated
this experiment on later occasions until the reptile understood her
She kept the experience to herself but one day it was witnessed by a
tunnelman On that day Peggys reputation was made

From this time henceforth the major part of Blue Cement Ridge became
serious collectors for what was known as Peggys menagerie and two
of the tunnelmen constructed a stockaded inclosurenot half a mile
from the blacksmiths cabin but unknown to himfor the reception of
specimens For a long time its existence was kept a secret between Peggy
and her loyal friends Her parents aware of her eccentric tastes only
through the introduction of such smaller creatures as lizards toads
and tarantulas into their housewhich usually escaped from their tin
cans and boxes and sought refuge in the family slippershad frowned
upon her zoological studies Her mother found that her woodland rambles
entailed an extraordinary wear and tear of her clothing A pinafore
reduced to ribbons by a young fox and a straw hat half swallowed by a
mountain kid did not seem to be a natural incident to an ordinary
walk to the schoolhouse Her sisters thought her tastes low and
her familiar association with the miners inconsistent with their own
dignity But Peggy went regularly to school was a fair scholar in
elementary studies what she knew of natural history in fact quite
startled her teachers and being also a teachable child was allowed
some latitude As for Peggy herself she kept her own faith unshaken
her little creed whose shibboleth was not to be afraid of Gods
creatures but to love em sustained her through reprimand torn
clothing and it is to be feared occasional bites and scratches from
the loved ones themselves

The unsuspected contiguity of the menagerie to the house had its
drawbacks and once nearly exposed her A mountain wolf cub brought
especially for her from the higher northern Sierras with great trouble
and expense by Jack Ryder of the Lone Star Lead unfortunately escaped
from the menagerie just as the child seemed to be in a fair way of
taming it Yet it had been already familiarized enough with civilization
to induce it to stop in its flight and curiously examine the
blacksmiths shop A shout from the blacksmith and a hurled hammer sent
it flying again with Mr Baker and his assistant in full pursuit But
it quickly distanced them with its long tireless gallop and they were
obliged to return to the forge lost in wonder and conjecture For the
blacksmith had recognized it as a stranger to the locality and as a
man of oracular pretension had a startling theory to account for its
presence This he confided to the editor of the local paper and the
next issue contained an editorial paragraph Our presage of a severe
winter in the higher Sierras and consequent spring floods in the
valleys has been startlingly confirmed Mountain wolves have been
seen in Blue Cement Ridge and our esteemed fellow citizen Mr Ephraim
Baker yesterday encountered a halfstarved cub entering his premises in
search of food Mr Baker is of the opinion that the mother of the
cub driven down by stress of weather was in the immediate vicinity
Nothing but the distress of the only responsible mother of the cub
Peggy and loyalty to her kept Jack Ryder from exposing the absurdity
publicly but for weeks the camp fires of Blue Cement Ridge shook with
the suppressed and unhallowed joy of the miners who were in the guilty
secret

But fortunately for Peggy the most favored of her cherished
possessions was not obliged to be kept secret That one exception was
an Indian dog This was also a gift and had been procured with great
difficulty by a packer from an Indian encampment on the Oregon
frontier The difficulty was in plain English that it had been
stolen from the Indians at some peril to the stealers scalp It was
a mongrel to all appearances of no recognized breed or outward
significance yet of a quality distinctly its own It was absolutely and
totally uncivilized Whether this was a hereditary trait or the result
of degeneracy no one knew It refused to enter a house it would not
stay in a kennel It would not eat in public but gorged ravenously
and stealthily in the shadows It had the slink of a tramp and in its
patched and mottled hide seemed to simulate the rags of a beggar It had
the tirelessness without the affected limp of a coyote Yet it had none
of the ferocity of barbarians With teeth that could gnaw through the
stoutest rope and toughest lariat it never bared them in anger It
was cringing without being amiable or submissive it was gentle without
being affectionate

Yet almost insensibly it began to yield to Peggys faith and kindness
Gradually it seemed to single her out as the one being in this vast
whitefaced and fully clothed community that it could trust It
presently allowed her to half drag half lead it to and fro from school
although on the approach of a stranger it would bite through the rope
or frantically endeavor to efface itself in Peggys petticoats It was
trying even to the childs sweet gravity to face the ridicule excited
by its appearance on the road and its habit of carrying its tail
between its legsat such an inflexible curve that on the authority
of Sam Bedell a misstep caused it to turn a back somersaultwas
painfully disconcerting But Peggy endured this as she did the greater
dangers of the High Street in the settlement where she had often at
her own risk absolutely to drag the dazed and bewildered creature from
under the wheels of carts and the heels of horses But this shyness
wore offor rather was eventually lost in the dogs complete and utter
absorption in Peggy His limited intelligence and imperfect perceptions
were excited for her alone His singularly keen scent detected her
wherever or how remote she might be Her passage along a blind trail
her deviations from the school path her more distant excursions
were all mysteriously known to him It seemed as if his senses were
concentrated in this one faculty No matter how unexpected or unfamiliar
the itinerary Lo the poor Indianas the men had nicknamed him in
possible allusion to his untutored mindalways arrived promptly and
silently

It was to this singular faculty that Peggy owed one of her strangest
experiences One Saturday afternoon she was returning from an errand to
the village when she was startled by the appearance of Lo in her path
For the reason already given she no longer took him with her to these
active haunts of civilization but had taught him on such occasions to
remain as a guard outside the stockade which contained her treasures
After reading him a severe lecture on this flagrant abandonment of his
trust enforced with great seriousness and an admonitory forefinger
she was concerned to see that the animal appeared less agitated by her
reproof than by some other disturbance He ran ahead of her instead
of at her heels as was his usual custom and barkeda thing he rarely
did Presently she thought she discovered the cause of this in the
appearance from the wood of a dozen men armed with guns They seemed to
be strangers but among them she recognized the deputy sheriff of the
settlement The leader noticed her and after a word or two with the
others the deputy approached her

You and Lo had better be scooting home by the highroad outer thisor
ye might get hurt he said half playfully half seriously

Peggy looked fearlessly at the men and their guns

Look ez ef you was huntin she said curiously

We are said the leader

Wot you huntin

The deputy glanced at the others Bar he replied

Bar repeated the child with the quick resentment which a palpable
falsehood always provoked in her There aint no bar in ten miles See
yourself huntin bar Ho

The man laughed Never you mind missy said the deputy you trot
along He laid his hand very gently on her head faced her sunbonnet
towards the near highway gave the usual parting pull to her brown
pigtail added Make a beeline home and turned away

Lo uttered the first growl known in his history Whereat Peggy said
with lofty forbearance Serve you jest right ef I set my dog on you

But force is no argument and Peggy felt this truth even of herself and
Lo So she trotted away Nevertheless Lo showed signs of hesitation
After a few moments Peggy herself hesitated and looked back The men
had spread out under the trees and were already lost in the woods But
there was more than one trail through it and Peggy knew it

And here an alarming occurrence startled her A curiously striped brown
and white squirrel whisked past her and ran up a tree Peggys round
eyes became rounder There was but one squirrel of that kind in all the
length and breadth of Blue Cement Ridge and that was in the menagerie
Even as she looked it vanished Peggy faced about and ran back to the
road in the direction of the stockade Lo bounding before her But
another surprise awaited her There was the clutter of short wings
under the branches and the sunlight flashed upon the iris throat of a
woodduck as it swung out of sight past her But in this single
glance Peggy recognized one of the latest and most precious of her
acquisitions There was no mistake now With a despairing little cry to
Lo The menageries broke loose she ran like the wind towards it She
cared no longer for the mandate of the men the trail she had taken was
out of their sight they were proceeding so slowly and cautiously that
she and Lo quickly distanced them in the same direction She would have
yet time to reach the stockade and secure what was left of her treasures
before they came up and drove her away Yet she had to make a long
circuit to avoid the blacksmiths shop and cabin before she saw the
stockade lifting its fourfoot walls around an inclosure a dozen feet
square in the midst of a manzanita thicket But she could see also
broken coops pens cages and boxes lying before it and stopped once
even in her grief and indignation to pick up a rubythroated lizard
one of its late inmates that had stopped in the trail stiffened to
stone at her approach The next moment she was before the roofless
walls and then stopped stiffened like the lizard For out of that
peaceful ruin which had once held the wild and untamed vagabonds of
earth and sky arose a type of savagery and barbarism the child had
never before looked uponthe head and shoulders of a hunted desperate
man

His head was bare and his hair matted with sweat over his forehead his
face was unshorn and the black roots of his beard showed against the
deadly pallor of his skin except where it was scratched by thorns
or where the red spots over his cheek bones made his cheeks look as
if painted His eyes were as insanely bright he panted as quickly he
showed his white teeth as perpetually his movements were as convulsive
as those captured animals she had known Yet he did not attempt to fly
and it was only when with a sudden effort and groan of pain he half
lifted himself above the stockade that she saw that his leg bandaged
with his cravat and handkerchief stained a dull red dragged helplessly
beneath him He stared at her vacantly for a moment and then looked
hurriedly into the wood behind her

The child was more interested than frightened and more curious than
either She had grasped the situation at a glance It was the hunted and
the hunters Suddenly he started and reached for his rifle which he had
apparently set down outside when he climbed into the stockade He had
just caught sight of a figure emerging from the wood at a distance But
the weapon was out of his reach

Hand me that gun he said roughly

But Peggy did not stir The figure came more plainly and quite
unconsciously into full view an easy shot at that distance

The man uttered a horrible curse and turned a threatening face on
the child But Peggy had seen something like that in animals SHE had
captured She only said gravely

Ef you shoot that gun youll bring em all down on you

All he demanded

Yes a dozen folks with guns like yours said Peggy You jest crouch
down and lie low Dont move Watch me

The man dropped below the stockade Peggy ran swiftly towards the
unsuspecting figure evidently the leader of the party but deviated
slightly to snatch a tiny spray from a whiteash tree She never knew
that in that brief interval the wounded man after a supreme effort had
possessed himself of his weapon and for a moment had covered HER with
its deadly muzzle She ran on fearlessly until she saw that she had
attracted the attention of the leader when she stopped and began to
wave the whiteash wand before her The leader halted conferred with
some one behind him who proved to be the deputy sheriff Stepping out
he advanced towards Peggy and called sharply

I told you to get out of this Come be quick

Youd better get out yourself said Peggy waving her ash spray and
quicker too

The deputy stopped staring at the spray Wots up

Rattlers

Where

Everywhere round yea reglar nest of em Thats your way round She
pointed to the right and again began beating the underbrush with her
wand The men had meantime huddled together in consultation It was
evident that the story of Peggy and her influence on rattlesnakes was
well known and in all probability exaggerated After a pause the
whole party filed off to the right making a long circuit of the unseen
stockade and were presently lost in the distance Peggy ran back to the
fugitive The fire of savagery and desperation in his eyes had gone out
but had been succeeded by a glazing film of faintness

Can youget mesome water he whispered

The stockade was near a springa necessity for the menagerie Peggy
brought him water in a dipper She sighed a little her butcher
birdnow lost foreverhad been the last to drink from it

The water seemed to revive him The rattlesnakes scared the cowards
he said with an attempt to smile Were there many rattlers

There wasnt ANY said Peggy a little spitefully cept YOUa
twolegged rattler

The rascal grinned at the compliment

ONElegged you mean he said indicating his helpless limb

Peggys heart relented slightly Wot you goin to do now she said
You cant stay on THERE you know It blongs to ME She was generous
but practical

Were those things I fired out yours

Yes

Mighty rough of me

Peggy was slightly softened Kin you walk

No

Kin you crawl

Not as far as a rattler

Ez far ez that clearin

Yes

Theres a hoss tethered out in that clearin I kin shift him to this
end

Youre white all through said the man gravely

Peggy ran off to the clearing The horse belonged to Sam Bedell but
he had given Peggy permission to ride it whenever she wished This was
equivalent in Peggys mind to a permission to PLACE him where she
wished She consequently led him to a point nearest the stockade and
thoughtfully close beside a stump But this took some time and when
she arrived she found the fugitive already there very thin and weak
but still smiling

Ye kin turn him loose when you get through with him hell find his way
back said Peggy Now I must go

Without again looking at the man she ran back to the stockade Then she
paused until she heard the sound of hoofs crossing the highway in the
opposite direction from which the pursuers had crossed and knew that
the fugitive had got away Then she took the astonished and still
motionless lizard from her pocket and proceeded to restore the broken
coops and cages to the empty stockade

But she never reconstructed her menagerie nor renewed her collection
People said she had tired of her whim and that really she was getting
too old for such things Perhaps she was But she never got old enough
to reveal her story of the last wild animal she had tamed by kindness
Nor was she quite sure of it herself until a few years afterwards on
Commencement Day at a boardingschool at San Jose when they pointed out
to her one of the most respectable trustees But they said he was once
a gambler who had shot a man with whom he had quarreled and was nearly
caught and lynched by a Vigilance Committee




THE GODDESS OF EXCELSIOR


When the two isolated mining companies encamped on Sycamore Creek
discovered on the same day the great Excelsior Lead they met around
a neutral camp fire with that grave and almost troubled demeanor which
distinguished the successful prospector in those days Perhaps the term
prospectors could hardly be used for men who had labored patiently
and lightheartedly in the one spot for over three years to gain a daily
yield from the soil which gave them barely the necessaries of life
Perhaps this was why now that their reward was beyond their most
sanguine hopes they mingled with this characteristic gravity an
ambition and resolve peculiarly their own Unlike most successful
miners they had no idea of simply realizing their wealth and departing
to invest or spend it elsewhere as was the common custom On the
contrary that night they formed a high resolve to stand or fall by
their claims to develop the resources of the locality to build up a
town and to devote themselves to its growth and welfare And to this
purpose they bound themselves that night by a solemn and legal compact

Many circumstances lent themselves to so original a determination The
locality was healthful picturesque and fertile Sycamore Creek a
considerable tributary of the Sacramento furnished them a generous
water supply at all seasons its banks were well wooded and
interspersed with undulating meadow land Its distance from stagecoach
communicationnine milescould easily be abridged by a wagon road over
a practically level country Indeed all the conditions for a thriving
settlement were already there It was natural therefore that the most
sanguine anticipations were indulged by the more youthful of the twenty
members of this sacred compact The sites of a hotel a bank the
express companys office stage office and courthouse with other
necessary buildings were all mapped out and supplemented by a theatre
a public park and a terrace along the river bank It was only when
Clinton Grey an intelligent but youthful member on offering a plan of
the town with five avenues eighty feet wide radiating from a central
plaza and the courthouse explained that it could be commanded by
artillery in case of an armed attack upon the building that it was
felt that a line must be drawn in anticipatory suggestion Nevertheless
although their determination was unabated at the end of six months
little had been done beyond the building of a wagon road and the
importation of new machinery for the working of the lead The
peculiarity of their design debarred any tentative or temporary efforts
they wished the whole settlement to spring up in equal perfection
so that the first stagecoach over the new road could arrive upon the
completed town We dont want to show up in a biled shirt and a plug
hat and our trousers stuck in our boots said a figurative speaker
Nevertheless practical necessity compelled them to build the hotel
first for their own occupation pending the erection of their private
dwellings on allotted sites The hotel a really elaborate structure
for the locality and period was a marvel to the workmen and casual
teamsters It was luxuriously fitted and furnished Yet it was in
connection with this outlay that the event occurred which had a singular
effect upon the fancy of the members

Washington Trigg a Western member who had brought up the architect and
builder from San Francisco had returned in a state of excitement He
had seen at an art exhibition in that city a small replica of a famous
statue of California and without consulting his fellow members had
ordered a larger copy for the new settlement He however made up for
his precipitancy by an extravagant description of his purchase which
impressed even the most cautious Its the figger of a mighty pretty
girl in them spirit clothes they allus wear holding a divinin rod for
findin gold afore her in one hand all the while shes hidin behind
her in the other hand a branch o thorns out of sight The idea
beindont you seethat blamed old fortyniners like us or
ordinary greenhorns aint allowed to see the difficulties theyve got
to go through before reaching a strike Mighty cute aint it Its
to be made lifesizethat is about the size of a girl of that kind
dont you see he explained somewhat vaguely and will look powerful
fetchin standin onto a pedestal in the hall of the hotel In reply to
some further cautious inquiry as to the exact details of the raiment
and of any possible shock to the modesty of lady guests at the hotel he
replied confidently Oh THATS all right Its the regulation uniform
of goddesses and angelssorter as if theyd caught up a sheet or a
cloud to fling round em before coming into this world afore folks
and being an allegory so to speak it aint as if it was me or you
prospectin in high water And being of bronze it

Looks like a squaw eh interrupted a critic or a cursed Chinaman

And if its of metal it will weigh a ton How are we going to get it
up here said another

But here Mr Trigg was on sure ground Ive ordered it cast holler
and if necessary in two sections he returned triumphantly A child
could tote it round and set it up

Its arrival was therefore looked forward to with great expectancy when
the hotel was finished and occupied by the combined Excelsior companies
It was to come from New York via San Francisco where however
there was some delay in its transshipment and still further delay at
Sacramento It finally reached the settlement over the new wagon
road and was among the first freight carried there by the new
express company and delivered into the new express office The
boxa packingcase nearly three feet square by five feet longbore
superficial marks of travel and misdirection inasmuch as the original
address was quite obliterated and the outside lid covered with corrected
labels It was carried to a private sittingroom in the hotel where
its beauty was to be first disclosed to the president of the united
companies three of the committee and the excited and triumphant
purchaser A less favored crowd of members and workmen gathered
curiously outside the room Then the lid was carefully removed
revealing a quantity of shavings and packing paper which still hid the
outlines of the goddess When this was promptly lifted a stare of blank
astonishment fixed the faces of the party It was succeeded by a quick
hysteric laugh and then a dead silence

Before them lay a dressmakers dummy the wire and padded model on
which dresses are fitted and shown With its armless and headless bust
abruptly ending in a hooped wire skirt it completely filled the sides
of the box

Shut the door said the president promptly

The order was obeyed The single hysteric shriek of laughter had been
followed by a deadly ironical silence The president with supernatural
gravity lifted it out and set it up on its small round disklike
pedestal

Its some cussed fool blunder of that confounded express company
burst out the unlucky purchaser But there was no echo to his outburst
He looked around with a timid tentative smile But no other smile
followed his

It looks said the president with portentous gravity like the
beginnings of a fine woman that MIGHT show up if you gave her time
into a firstclass goddess Of course she aint all here other boxes
with sections of her I reckon are under way from her factory and will
meander along in the course of the year Considerin this as a sampleI
think gentlemen he added with gloomy precision we are prepared to
accept it and signify well take more

It aint perhaps exactly the idee that weve been led to expect from
previous description said Dick Flint with deeper seriousness for
instance this yer branch of thorns we heard of ez bein held behind her
is wantin as is the arms that held it but even if they had arrived
anybody could see the thorns through them wires and so give the hull
show away

Jam it into its box again and well send it back to the confounded
express company with a cussin letter again thundered the wretched
purchaser

No sonny said the president with gentle but gloomy determination
well fasten on to this little show jest as it is and see what
follows It aint every day that a firstclass sell like this is worked
off on us ACCIDENTALLY

It was quite true The settlement had long since exhausted every
possible form of practical joking and languished for a new sensation
And here it was It was not a thing to be treated angrily nor lightly
nor dismissed with that single hysteric laugh It was capable of the
greatest possibilities Indeed as Washington Trigg looked around on the
imperturbably ironical faces of his companions he knew that they felt
more true joy over the blunder than they would in the possession of the
real statue But an exclamation from the fifth member who was examining
the box arrested their attention

Theres suthin else here

He had found under the heavier wrapping a layer of tissuepaper and
under that a further envelope of linen lightly stitched together A
knife blade quickly separated the stitches and the linen was carefully
unfolded It displayed a beautifully trimmed evening dress of pale blue
satin with a dressinggown of some exquisite white fabric armed with
lace The men gazed at it in silence and then the one single expression
broke from their lips

Her duds

Stop boys said Clint Grey as a movement was made to lift the
dress towards the model leave that to a man who knows Whats the
use of my having left five grownup sisters in the States if I havent
brought a little experience away with me This sort of thing aint to be
pulled on like trousers No sirTHIS is the way shes worked

With considerable dexterity unexpected gentleness and some taste
he shook out the folds of the skirt delicately and lifted it over the
dummy settling it skillfully upon the wire hoops and drawing the
bodice over the padded shoulders This he then proceeded to fasten with
hooks and eyesa work of some patience Forty eager fingers stretched
out to assist him but were waved aside with a look of pained decorum
as he gravely completed his task Then falling back he bade the others
do the same and they formed a contemplative semicircle before the
figure

Up to that moment a delighted but unsmiling consciousness of their own
absurdities a keen sense of the humorous possibilities of the
original blunder and a mischievous recognition of the mortification of
Triggwhose only safety now lay in accepting the mistake in the same
spirithad determined these grownup schoolboys to artfully protract
a joke that seemed to be providentially delivered into their hands But
NOW an odd change crept on them The light from the open window that
gave upon the enormous pines and the rolling prospect up to the
dim heights of the Sierras fell upon this strange incongruous yet
perfectly artistic figure For the dress was the skillful creation of a
great Parisian artist and in its exquisite harmony of color shape
and material it not only hid the absurd model but clothed it with an
alarming grace and refinement A queer feeling of awe of shame and of
unwilling admiration took possession of them Some of themfrom
remote Western townshad never seen the like before those who HAD had
forgotten it in those five years of selfexile of healthy independence
and of contiguity to Nature in her unaffected simplicity All had been
familiar with the garish extravagant and dazzling femininity of
the Californian towns and cities but never had they known anything
approaching the ideal grace of this type of exalted even if artificial
womanhood And although in the fierce freedom of their little republic
they had laughed to scorn such artificiality a few yards of satin and
lace cunningly fashioned and thrown over a frame of wood and wire
touched them now with a strange sense of its superiority The better
to show its attractions Clinton Grey had placed the figure near a
fulllength goldframed mirror beside a marbletopped table Yet how
cheap and tawdry these splendors showed beside this work of art How
cruel was the contrast of their own rough working clothes to this
miracle of adornment which that same mirror reflected And even when
Clinton Grey the enthusiast looked towards his beloved woods for
relief he could not help thinking of them as a more fitting frame for
this strange goddess than this new house into which she had strayed
Their gravity became real their gibes in some strange way had vanished

Must have cost a pile of money said one merely to break an
embarrassing silence

My sister had a friend who brought over a dress from Paris not as
hightoned as that that cost five hundred dollars said Clinton Grey

How much did you say that spiritclad old rag of yours costthorns and
all said the president turning sharply on Trigg

Trigg swallowed this depreciation of his own purchase meekly Seven
hundred and fifty dollars without the express charges

Thats only twofifty more said the president thoughtfully if we
call it quits

But said Trigg in alarm we must send it back

Not much sonny said the president promptly Well hang on to this
until we hear where that thorny old chump of yours has fetched up and is
actin her conundrums and mebbe we can swap even

But how will we explain it to the boys queried Trigg Theyre
waitin outside to see it

There WONT be any explanation said the president in the same tone
of voice in which he had ordered the door shut Well just say that
the statue hasnt come which is the frozen truth and this box only
contained some silk curtain decorations wed ordered which is only
half a lie And still more firmly THIS SECRET DOESNT GO OUT OF THIS
ROOM GENTLEMENor I aint your president Im not going to let you
give yourselves away to that crowd outsideyou hear me Have you ever
allowed your unfettered intellect to consider what theyd say about
thiswhat a godsend it would be to every man wed ever had a pull on
in this camp Why it would last em a whole year wed never hear the
end of it No gentlemen I prefer to live here without shootin my
fellow man but I cant promise it if they once start this joke agin
us

There was a swift approval of this sentiment and the five members shook
hands solemnly

Now said the president well just fold up that dress again and put
it with the figure in this closethe opened a large dressingchest
in the suite of rooms in which they stoodand well each keep a key
Well retain this room for committee purposes so that no one need see
the closet See Now take off the dress Be careful there Youre not
handlin pay dirt though its about as expensive Steady

Yet it was wonderful to see the solicitude and care with which the dress
was recovered and folded in its linen wrapper

Hold on exclaimed Triggas the dummy was lifted into the
chestwe havent tried on the other dress

Yes yes repeated the others eagerly theres another

Well keep that for next committee meeting gentlemen said the
president decisively Lock her up Trigg


The three following months wrought a wonderful change in
Excelsiorwonderful even in that land of rapid growth and progress
Their organized and matured plans executed by a full force of workmen
from the county town completed the twenty cottages for the members the
bank and the town hall Visitors and intending settlers flocked over
the new wagon road to see this new Utopia whose founders holding the
land and its improvements as a corporate company exercised the right
of dictating the terms on which settlers were admitted The feminine
invasion was not yet potent enough to affect their consideration either
through any refinement or attractiveness being composed chiefly of the
industrious wives and daughters of small traders or temporary artisans
Yet it was found necessary to confide the hotel to the management of Mr
Dexter Marsh his wife and one intelligent but somewhat plain daughter
who looked after the accounts There were occasional lady visitors at
the hotel attracted from the neighboring towns and settlements by
its picturesqueness and a vague suggestiveness of its being a
wateringplaceand there was the occasional flash in the decorous
street of a Sacramento or San Francisco gown It is needless to say that
to the five men who held the guilty secret of Committee Room No 4 it
only strengthened their belief in the superelegance of their hidden
treasure At their last meeting they had fitted the second dresswhich
turned out to be a vapory summer housefrock or morning wrapperover
the dummy and opinions were divided as to its equality with the first
However the same subtle harmony of detail and grace of proportion
characterized it

And you see said Clint Grey its jest the sort o rig in which a
man would be most likely to know herand not in her warpaint which
would be only now and then

Already SHE had become an individuality

Hush said the president He had turned towards the door at which
some one was knocking lightly

Come in

The door opened upon Miss Marsh secretary and hotel assistant She had
a business aspect and an open letter in her hand but hesitated at
the evident confusion she had occasioned Two of the gentlemen had
absolutely blushed and the others regarded her with inane smiles or
affected seriousness They all coughed slightly

I beg your pardon she said not ungracefully a slight color coming
into her sallow cheek which in conjunction with the gold eyeglasses
gave her at least in the eyes of the impressible Clint a certain
piquancy But my father said you were here in committee and I might
consult you I can come again if you are busy

She had addressed the president partly from his office his
comparatively extreme agehe must have been at least thirtyand
possibly for his extremer good looks He said hurriedly Its just an
informal meeting and then more politely What can we do for you

We have an application for a suite of rooms next week she said
referring to the letter and as we shall be rather full father thought
you gentlemen might be willing to take another larger room for your
meetings and give up these which are part of a suiteand perhaps not
exactly suitable

Quite impossible Quite so Really out of the question said the
members in a rapid chorus

The young girl was evidently taken aback at this unanimity of
opposition She stared at them curiously and then glanced around the
room Were quite comfortable here said the president explanatorily
andin factits just what we want

We could give you a closet like that which you could lock up and a
mirror she suggested with the faintest trace of a smile

Tell your father Miss Marsh said the president with dignified
politeness that while we cannot submit to any change we fully
appreciate his business foresight and are quite prepared to see that
the hotel is properly compensated for our retaining these rooms As the
young girl withdrew with a puzzled curtsy he closed the door placed his
back against it and said

What the deuce did she mean by speaking of that closet

Reckon she allowed we kept some fancy drinks in there said Trigg
and calkilated that we wanted the marble stand and mirror to put our
glasses on and make it look like a swell private bar thats all

Humph said the president

Their next meeting however was a hurried one and as the president
arrived late when the door closed smartly behind him he was met by the
worried faces of his colleagues

Heres a go said Trigg excitedly producing a folded paper The
games up the hull show is busted that cussed old statuethe reglar
old hag herselfis on her way here Theres a bill o lading and the
express companys letter and shell be trundled down here by express at
any moment

Well said the president quietly

Well replied the members aghast Do you know what that means

That we must rig her up in the hall on a pedestal as we reckoned to
do returned the president coolly

But you dont sabe said Clinton Grey thats all very well as to the
hag but now we must give HER up with an adoring glance towards the
closet

Does the letter say so

No said Trigg hesitatingly no But I reckon we cant keep BOTH

Why not said the president imperturbably if we paid for em

As the men only stared in reply he condescended to explain

Look here I calculated all these risks after our last meeting While
you boys were just fussin round doin nothing I wrote to the express
company that a box of womens damaged duds had arrived here while we
were looking for our statue that you chaps were so riled at bein
sold by them that you dumped the whole blamed thing in the creek But I
added if theyd let me know what the damage was Id send em a draft
to cover it After a spell of waitin they said theyd call it square
for two hundred dollars considering our disappointment And I sent the
draft Thats spurred them up to get over our statue I reckon And now
that its coming it will set us right with the boys

And SHE said Clinton Grey again pointing to the locked chest
belongs to us

Until we can find some lady guest that will take her with the rooms
returned the president a little cynically

But the arrival of the real statue and its erection in the hotel
vestibule created a new sensation The members of the Excelsior Company
were loud in its praises except the executive committee whose coolness
was looked upon by the others as an affectation of superiority It
awakened the criticism and jealousy of the nearest town

We hear said the Red Dog Advertiser that the longpromised statue
has been put up in that hightoned Hash Dispensary they call a hotel
at Excelsior It represents an emaciated squaw in a scanty blanket
gathering roots and carrying a bit of thornbush kindlings behind her
The hightoned close corporation of Excelsior may consider this a fair
allegory of California WE should say it looks mighty like a prophetic
forecast of a hard winter on Sycamore Creek and scarcity of provisions
However it isnt our funeral though its rather depressing to the
casual visitor on his way to dinner For a long time this work of
art was missing and supposed to be lost but by being sternly and
persistently rejected at every express office on the route it was at
last taken in at Excelsior

There was some criticism nearer home

What do you think of it Miss Marsh said the president politely to
that active young secretary as he stood before it in the hall The
young woman adjusted her eyeglasses over her aquiline nose

As an idea or a woman sir

As a woman madam said the president letting his brown eyes slip
for a moment from Miss Marshs corncolored crest over her straight but
scant figure down to her smart slippers

Well sir she could wear YOUR boots and there isnt a corset in
Sacramento would go round her

Thank you he returned gravely and moved away For a moment a wild
idea of securing possession of the figure some dark night and in
company with his fellowconspirators of trying those beautiful clothes
upon her passed through his mind but he dismissed it And then
occurred a strange incident which startled even his cool American
sanity

It was a beautiful moonlight night and he was returning to a bedroom
at the hotel which he temporarily occupied during the painting of
his house It was quite late he having spent the evening with a San
Francisco friend after a business conference which assured him of the
remarkable prosperity of Excelsior It was therefore with some human
exaltation that he looked around the sleeping settlement which had
sprung up under the magic wand of their good fortune The full moon had
idealized their youthful designs with something of their own youthful
coloring graciously softening the garish freshness of paint and
plaster hiding with discreet obscurity the disrupted banks and broken
woods at the beginning and end of their broad avenues paving the rough
river terrace with tessellated shadows and even touching the rapid
stream which was the source of their wealth with a Pactolean glitter

The windows of the hotel before him darkened within flashed in the
moonbeams like the casements of Aladdins palace Mingled with his
ambition tonight were some softer fancies rarely indulged by him in
his forecast of the future of Excelsiora dream of some fair partner
in his life after this task was accomplished yet always of some one
moving in a larger world than his youth had known Rousing the half
sleeping porter he found however only the spectral goldseeker in
the vestibulethe rays of his solitary candle falling upon her
diviningrod with a quaint persistency that seemed to point to the
stairs he was ascending When he reached the first landing the rising
wind through an open window put out his light but although the
staircase was in darkness he could see the long corridor above
illuminated by the moonlight throughout its whole length He had nearly
reached it when the slow but unmistakable rustle of a dress in the
distance caught his ear He paused not only in the interest of
delicacy but with a sudden nervous thrill he could not account for The
rustle came nearerhe could hear the distinct froufrou of satin and
then to his bewildered eyes what seemed to be the figure of the
dummy arrayed in the pale blue evening dress he knew so well passed
gracefully and majestically down the corridor He could see the shapely
folds of the skirt the symmetry of the bodice even the harmony of the
trimmings He raised his eyes half affrightedly prepared to see
the headless shoulders but theyand what seemed to be a headwere
concealed in a floating cloud or nubia of some fleecy tissue as
if for protection from the evening air He remained for an instant
motionless dazed by this apparent motion of an inanimate figure but
as the absurdity of the idea struck him he hurriedly but stealthily
ascended the remaining stairs resolved to follow it But he was only in
time to see it turn into the angle of another corridor which when he
had reached it was empty The figure had vanished

His first thought was to go to the committee room and examine the locked
closet But the key was in his desk at home he had no light and the
room was on the other side of the house Besides he reflected that
even the detection of the figure would involve the exposure of the very
secret they had kept intact so long He sought his bedroom and went
quietly to bed But not to sleep a curiosity more potent than any sense
of the trespass done him kept him tossing half the night Who was this
woman whom the clothes fitted so well He reviewed in his mind the
guests in the house but he knew none who could have carried off this
masquerade so bravely

In the morning early he made his way to the committee room but as he
approached was startled to observe two pairs of boots a mans and a
womans conjugally placed before its door Now thoroughly indignant
he hurried to the office and was confronted by the face of the fair
secretary She colored quickly on seeing himbut the reason was
obvious

You are coming to scold me sir But it is not my fault We were full
yesterday afternoon when your friend from San Francisco came here with
his wife We told him those were YOUR rooms but he said he would make
it right with youand my father thought you would not be displeased
for once Everything of yours was put into another room and the closet
remains locked as you left it

Amazed and bewildered the president could only mutter a vague apology
and turn away Had his friends wife opened the door with another key in
some fit of curiosity and disported herself in those clothes If so she
DARE not speak of her discovery

An introduction to the lady at breakfast dispelled this faint hope She
was a plump woman whose generous proportions could hardly have been
confined in that pale blue bodice she was frank and communicative with
no suggestion of mischievous concealment

Nevertheless he made a firm resolution As soon as his friends left
he called a meeting of the committee He briefly informed them of the
accidental occupation of the room but for certain reasons of his own
said nothing of his ghostly experience But he put it to them plainly
that no more risks must be run and that he should remove the dresses
and dummy to his own house To his considerable surprise this suggestion
was received with grave approval and a certain strange relief

We kinder thought of suggesting it to you before said Mr Trigg
slowly and that mebbe weve played this little game long enoughfor
suthins happened thats makin it anything but funny Wed have told
you before but we dassent Speak out Clint and tell the president
what we saw the other night and dont mince matters

The president glanced quickly and warningly around him I thought he
said sternly that wed dropped all fooling Its no time for practical
joking now

Honest Injunits gospel truth Speak up Clint

The president looked on the serious faces around him and was himself
slightly awed

Its a matter of two or three nights ago said Grey slowly that
Trigg and I were passing through Sycamore Woods just below the hotel
It was after twelvebright moonlight so that we could see everything
as plain as day and we were dead sober Just as we passed under the
sycamores Trigg grabs my arm and says Hi I looked up and there
not ten yards away standing dead in the moonlight was that dummy She
was all in whitethat dress with the fairy frills you knowand had
whats more A HEAD At least something white all wrapped around it
and over her shoulders At first we thought you or some of the boys
had dressed her up and lifted her out there for a joke and left her
to frighten us So we started forward and thenits the gospel
truthshe MOVED AWAY gliding like the moonbeams and vanished among
the trees

Did you see her face asked the president

No you bet I didnt try toit would have haunted me forever

What do you mean

ThisI mean it was that GIRL THE BOX BELONGED TO Shes dead
somewhereas youll find out sooner or laterAND HAS COME BACK FOR HER
CLOTHES Ive often heard of such things before

Despite his coolness at this corroboration of his own experience
and impressed by Greys unmistakable awe a thrill went through the
president For an instant he was silent

That will do boys he said finally Its a queer story but
remember its all the more reason now for our keeping our secret As
for those things Ill remove them quietly and at once

But he did not

On the contrary prolonging his stay at the hotel with plausible
reasons he managed to frequently visit the committee room or its
vicinity at different and unsuspected hours of the day and night
More than that he found opportunities to visit the office and under
pretexts of business connected with the economy of the hotel management
informed himself through Miss Marsh on many points A few of these
details naturally happened to refer to herself her prospects her
tastes and education He learned incidentally what he had partly
known that her father had been in better circumstances and that she
had been gently nurturedthough of this she made little account in her
pride in her own independence and devotion to her duties But in his
own persistent way he also made private notes of the breadth of her
shoulders the size of her waist her height length of her skirt her
movements in walking and other apparently extraneous circumstances It
was natural that he acquired some supplemental factsthat her
eyes under her eyeglasses were a tender gray and touched with the
melancholy beauty of nearsightedness that her face had a sensitive
mobility beyond the mere charm of color and like most people lacking
this primitive and striking element of beauty what was really fine
about her escaped the first sight As for instance it was only
by bending over to examine her accounts that he found that her
indistinctive hair was as delicate as floss silk and as electrical It
was only by finding her romping with the children of a guest one evening
that he was startled by the appalling fact of her youth But about this
time he left the hotel and returned to his house

On the first yearly anniversary of the great strike at Excelsior there
were some changes in the settlement notably the promotion of Mr Marsh
to a more important position in the company and the installation of
Miss Cassie Marsh as manageress of the hotel As Miss Marsh read the
official letter signed by the president conveying in complimentary but
formal terms this testimony of their approval and confidence her lip
trembled slightly and a tear trickling from her light lashes dimmed
her eyeglasses so that she was fain to go up to her room to recover
herself alone When she did so she was startled to find a wire dummy
standing near the door and neatly folded upon the bed two elegant
dresses A note in the presidents own hand lay beside them A swift
blush stung her cheek as she read


DEAR MISS MARSHWill you make me happy by keeping the secret that no
other woman but yourself knows and by accepting the clothes that no
other woman but yourself can wear


The next moment with the dresses over her arm and the ridiculous dummy
swinging by its wires from her other hand she was flying down the
staircase to Committee Room No 4 The door opened upon its sole
occupant the president

Oh sir how cruel of you she gasped It was only a joke of mine
   I always intended to tell you    It was very foolish but it
seemed so funny    You see I thought it was    the dress you
had bought for your future intendedsome young lady you were going to
marry

It is said the president quietly and he closed the door behind her

And it was
