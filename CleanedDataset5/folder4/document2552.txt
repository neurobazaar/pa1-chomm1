THANKFULS INHERITANCE

By Joseph C Lincoln




CHAPTER I


The road from Wellmouth Centre to East Wellmouth is not a good one even
in dry weather and daylight it is not that For the first two miles it
winds and twists its sandy way over bare hills with cranberry
swamps and marshy ponds in the hollows between Then it enters upon a
threemile stretch bordered with scrubby pines and bayberry thickets
climbing at last a final hill to emerge upon the bluff with the ocean
at its foot And fringing that bluff and clustering thickest in the
lowlands just beyond is the village of East Wellmouth which must on
no account be confused with South Wellmouth or North Wellmouth or West
Wellmouth or even Wellmouth Port

On a bright sunny summer day the East Wellmouth road is a hard one to
travel At nine oclock of an evening in March with a howling gale
blowing and rain pouring in torrents traveling it is an experience
Winnie S who drives the East Wellmouth depotwagon had undergone the
experience several times in the course of his professional career but
each time he vowed vehemently that he would not repeat it he would
heave up his job first

He was vowing it now Perched on the edge of the depot wagons front
seat the reins leading from his clenched fists through the slit in the
boot to the rings on the collar of General Jackson the aged horse he
expressed his opinion of the road the night and the job

By Judas priest declared Winnie Shis name was Winfield Scott
Hancock Holt but no resident of East Wellmouth called him anything but
Winnie Sby Judas priest If this aint enough to make a feller give
up tryin to earn a livin then I dont know Tell him he cant ship
aboard a schooner cause goin to seas a dogs life and then put him
on a job like this Dogs life Judas priest What kind of a lifes
THIS I want to know

From the curtain depths of the depotwagon behind him a voice answered
a womans voice

Judgin by the amount of dampness in it I should think you might call
it a ducks life it suggested

Winnie S accepted this pleasantry with a grunt I most wish I was
a duck he declared savagely Then I could set in three inches of
icewater and like it maybe Now whats the matter with you This last
a roar to the horse whose splashy progress along the gullied road had
suddenly ceased Whats the matter with you now repeated Winnie
What have you done come to anchor Git dap

But General Jackson refused to git dap Jerks at the reins only caused
him to stamp and evince an inclination to turn around Go ahead he would
not

Judas priest exclaimed the driver I do believe the critters
drowndin Somethins wrong Ive got to get out and see I spose Set
right where you be ladies Ill be back in a minute adding as he
took a lighted lantern from beneath the seat and pulled aside the heavy
boot preparatory to alighting unless I get in over my head which
aint so dummed unlikely as it sounds

Lantern in hand he clambered clumsily from beneath the boot and
disappeared Inside the vehicle was blackness dense damp and profound

Auntie said a second feminine voice Auntie what DO you suppose has
happened

I dont know Emily Im prepared for most anything by this time
Maybe weve landed on Mount Ararat I feel as if Id been afloat for
forty days and nights Land sakes alive as another gust shot and beat
its accompanying cloudburst through and between the carriage curtains
right in my face and eyes I dont wonder that boy wished he was a
duck Id like to be a fishor a mermaid I couldnt be much wetter if
I was either one and Id have gills so I could breathe under water I
SUPPOSE mermaids have gills I dont know

Emily laughed Aunt Thankful she declared I believe you would find
something funny in a case of smallpox

Maybe I should I never tried Twouldnt be much harder than to be
funny withwith rainwater on the brain Im so disgusted with myself
I dont know what to do The idea of me daughter and granddaughter of
seafarin folks that studied the weather all their lives not knowin
enough to stay to home when it looked as much like a storm as it did
this mornin And draggin you into it too We could have come tomorrow
or next day just as well but no nothin to do but I must start today
cause Id planned to This comes of figgerin to profit by what folks
leave to you in wills Talk about dead mens shoes Live mens rubber
boots would be worth more to you and me this minute SUCH a cruise as
this has been

It had been a hard trip certainly and the amount of water through
which they had traveled the latter part of it almost justified its being
called a cruise Old Captain Abner Barnes skipper for the twenty
years before his death of the coasting schooner T I Smalley had
during his lifelong seafaring never made a much rougher voyage all
things considered than that upon which his last will and testament had
sent his niece and her young companion

Captain Abner a widower had when he died left his house and land at
East Wellmouth to his niece by marriage Mrs Thankful Barnes Thankful
whose husband Eben Barnes was lost at sea the year after their
marriage had been living with and acting as housekeeper for an elderly
woman named Pearson at South Middleboro She Thankful had never
visited her East Wellmouth inheritance For four years after she
inherited it she received the small rent paid her by the tenant one
Laban Eldredge His name was all she knew concerning him Then he died
and for the next eight months the house stood empty And then came one
more death that of old Mrs Pearson the lady for whom Thankful had
kept house

Left alone and without present employment the Widow Barnes considered
what she should do next And thus considering the desire to visit and
inspect her East Wellmouth property grew and strengthened She thought
more and more concerning it It was hers she could do what she pleased
with it and she began to formulate vague ideas as to what she might
like to do She kept these ideas to herself but she spoke to Emily
Howes concerning the possibilities of a journey to East Wellmouth

Emily was Mrs Barnes favorite cousin although only a second cousin
Her mother Sarah Cahoon Thankfuls own cousin had married a man named
Howes Emily was the only child by this marriage But later there was
another marriage this time to a person named Hobbs and there were five
little Hobbses Papa Hobbs worked occasionally but not often His wife
and Emily worked all the time The latter had been teaching school
in Middleboro but now it was spring vacation So when Aunt Thankful
suggested the Cape Cod tour of inspection Emily gladly agreed to go
The Hobbs house was not a haven of joy especially to Mr Hobbs
stepdaughter and almost any change was likely to be an agreeable one

They had left South Middleboro that afternoon The rain began when
the train reached West Ostable At Bayport it had become a storm At
Wellmouth Centre it was a gale and a miniature flood And now shut
up in the back part of the depotwagon with the roaring wind and
splashing beating rain outside Thankfuls references to fish and ducks
and mermaids even to Mount Ararat seemed to Emily quite appropriate
They had planned to spend the night at the East Wellmouth hotel and
visit the Barnes property in the morning But it was five long miles to
that hotel from the Wellmouth Centre station Their progress so far had
been slow enough Now they had stopped altogether

A flash of light showed above the top of the carriage boot

Mercy on us cried Aunt Thankful Is that lightnin All we need to
make this complete is to be struck by lightnin No taint lightnin
its just the lantern Our pilots comin back I guess likely Well he
aint been washed away thats one comfort

Winnie S holding the lantern in his hand reappeared beneath the boot
Raindrops sparkled on his eyebrows his nose and the point of his chin

Judas priest he gasped If this aint

You neednt say it Well agree with you interrupted Mrs Barnes
hastily Is anything the matter

The drivers reply was in the form of elaborate sarcasm

Oh no he drawled there wasnt nothin the matter Just a few
million pines blowed across the road and the breechin busted and the
forard wheel about ready to come off thats all Maybe theres a few
other things I didnt notice but thats all I see

Humph Well theyll do for a spell Hows the weather any worse

Worse No they aint no worse made Looks as if twas breakin a
little over to westard furs that goes But how in the nation well
ever fetch East Wellmouth I dont know Git dap GIT DAP Have you
growed fast

General Jackson pulled one foot after the other from the mud and the
wagon rocked and floundered as its pilot steered it past the fallen
trees For the next twenty minutes no one spoke Then Winnie S breathed
a sigh of thankfulness

Well were out of that stretch of woods anyhow he declared And it
taint rainin so hard nuther Callate we can get to civilization if
that breechin holds and the pesky wheel dont come off How are you in
aft there tolerable snug

Emily said nothing Aunt Thankful chuckled at the word

Snug she repeated My yes If this water was salt wed be as snug
as a couple of pickled mackerel How far off is this civilization youre
talkin about

Well our hotel where youre bound is a good two mile but
theresJudas priest there goes that breechin again

There was another halt while the breeching underwent temporary repairs
The wind blew as hard as ever but the rain had almost stopped A few
minutes later it stopped altogether

There declared Winnie S The fust miles gone I dont knows I
hadnt ought to stop

Aunt Thankful interrupted Stop she cried For mercy sakes dont
stop anywheres unless you have to Weve done nothin but stop ever
since we started Go on as far as you can while thisthis machine of
yours is wound up

But that was not destined to be far From beneath the forward end of
the depotwagon sounded a most alarming creak a longdrawn threatening
groan Winnie S uttered his favorite exclamation

Judas priest he shouted There goes that wheel Ive been expectin
it

He tugged at the right hand rein General Jackson who having been
brought up in a seafaring community had learned to answer his helm
swerved sharply from the road Emily screamed faintly

Where are you goin demanded Mrs Barnes

The driver did not answer The groan from beneath the carriage was more
ominously threatening than ever And suddenly the threat was fulfilled
The depotwagon jerked on for a few feet and then with a crack settled
down to port in a most alarming fashion Winnie S settled down with it
still holding tight to the reins and roaring commands to General Jackson
at the top of his lungs

Whoa he hollered Whoa Stand still Stand still where you be
Whoa

General Jackson stood still Generally speaking he needed but one hint
to do that His commander climbed out or fell out from beneath the
boot The ground upon which he fell was damp but firm

Whoa he roared again Then scrambling to his feet he sprang toward
the wagon which the forward wheel detached and flat beneath it
was resting on the remaining three in a fashion which promised total
capsizing at any moment

Be you hurt Be you hurt demanded Winnie S

From inside the tightly drawn curtains there came a variety of sounds
screams exclamations and grunts as of someone gasping for breath

Be you hurt yelled the frantic Mr Holt

It was the voice of the younger passenger which first made coherent
reply

No it panted No II think Im not hurt But Aunt ThankfulOh
Auntie are you

Aunt Thankful herself interrupted Her voice was vigorous enough but it
sounded as if smothered beneath a heavy weight

No no she gasped IIm all right Im all right Or I guess I
shall be when you getoff of me

Judas priest cried Winnie S and sprang to the scene It was the
younger woman Emily whom he rescued first She being on the upper
side of the tilted wagon had slid pellmell along the seat down upon
the body of her companion Mrs Barnes was beneath and getting her out
was a harder task However it was accomplished at last

Mercy on us exclaimed the lady as her companions assisted her to
rise Mercy on us I feel like a pancake I never knew you weighed so
much Emily Howes Well thats all right and no bones broke Where
are we now Whywhy thats a house I do believe Were in somebodys
yard

They were that was plain even on a night as dark as this Behind them
bordering the stretch of mud and puddles which they had just left was
the silhouette of a dilapidated picket fence and in front loomed the
shadowy shapes of buildings

Were in somebodys yard repeated Thankful And theres a house
as sure as I live Well I never thought Id be so grateful just at the
bare sight of one Id begun to think I never would see a house again
If wed run afoul of a ship I shouldnt have been so surprised Come on
Emily

She seized her companion by the hand and led the way toward the nearest
and largest building Winnie S having retrieved and relighted the
overturned lantern was inspecting the wreck of the depotwagon It was
some minutes before he noticed that his passengers had disappeared Then
he set up a shout

Hi Where you be he shouted

Here was the answer Here by the front door

Hey Oh all right Stay where you be Ill be there pretty soon

The pretty soon was not very soon Mrs Barnes began to lose patience

I aint goin to roost on this step till mornin she declared Im
goin inside Aint that a bell handle on your side of the door Emily
Give it a pull for mercy sakes

But Auntie

Give it a pull I tell you I dont know who lives here and I dont
care If twas the President of the United States hed have to turn out
and let us in this night Here let me do it

She gave the glass knob a sharp jerk From within sounded the jingle of
an oldfashioned spring bell

There she exclaimed I guess theyll hear that Anyway Ill give
em one more for good measure

She jerked the bell again The peal died away in a series of lessening
tinkles but there was no other sound from within

They must be sound sleepers whispered Emily after a moment

They must be dead declared Thankful Theres been smashin and
crackin and hollerin enough to wake up anybody that want buried How
that wind does blow IHello here comes that man at last About time
I should say

Winnie S appeared bearing the lantern

What you doin he asked There aint no use ringin that bell
Nobodyll hear it

Thankful who had just given the bell a third pull took her hand from
the knob

Why not she demanded It makes noise enough I should think a graven
image would hear it What is this a home for deaf people

Winnie S grinned Taint nobodys home not now he said This
house is empty Aint nobody lived in it for most a year

The two women looked at each other Mrs Barnes drew along breath

Well she observed if this aint the last straw Such a cruise as
weve had and finally be shipwrecked right in front of a house and find
its an empty one Dont talk to ME Well sharply what shall we do
next

The driver shook his head

Dummed if I know he answered The old wagon cant go another yard
II callate you folksll have to stay here for a spell

Stay Wherell we stay out here in the middle of this howlin
wilderness

I guess so Unless you want to walk the rest of the way sames Im
callatin to Im goin to unharness the horse and put him under the
shed here and then hoof it over to the village and get somebody to come
and help You can come along if you want to but itll be a tougher
vyage than the one weve come through

How far off is thisthis village of yours

Oh about a mile and a half

A mile and a half And its beginnin to rain again Emily I dont
know how you feel but if the horse can wait under the shed until
somebody comes I guess we can I say lets do it

Emily nodded Of course Auntie she said emphatically We couldnt
walk a mile and a half in a storm like this Of course we must wait
Where is the shed

Winnie S led the way to the shed It was a ramshackle affair open
on one side General Jackson tethered to a rusty ring at the back
whinnied a welcome

The driver holding the lantern aloft looked about him His two
passengers looked also

Well observed Thankful this may have been a shed once but its
more like a sieve now Theres more leaks to the roof than there is
boards enough sight However any port in a storm and weve got the
storm sartin All right Mister Whatsyourname well wait

Winnie S turned away Then he turned back again

Maybe Id better leave you the lantern he said doubtfully I
guess likely I could get along without it andand twould make it more
sociable for you

He put the lantern down on the earth floor beside them and strode off
into the dark Mrs Barnes called after him

Aint there any way of gettin into that house she asked It acts as
if twas goin to storm hard as ever and this shed aint the mostwhat
did you call itsociable place in creation in spite of the lantern
If we could only get inside that house

Winnie S interrupted They could not see him but there was a queer
note in his voice

Get inside he repeated Get into THAT house this time of night
Wellwell maybe you could but I wouldnt do it not for nothin You
better wait in the shed Ill be back soon as ever I can

They heard him splashing along the road Then a gust of wind and a
torrent of rain beating upon the leaky roof drowned all other sounds
Emily turned to her companion

Auntie she said if you and I were superstitious we might think
all this all that weve been through was what people call a sign a
warning That is what ever so many South Middleboro people would say

Humph if I believed in signs Id have noticed the weather signs afore
we started Those are all the signs I believe in and I ought to have
known better than to risk comin when it looked so threatenin I cant
forgive myself for that However we did come and here we arewherever
here is Now what in the world did that man mean by sayin we better
not try to get into that house I dont care what he meant Give me that
lantern

Auntie where are you going

Im goin to take an observation of those windows Nine chances to one
they aint all locked and if theres one open you and I can crawl
into it I wish we could boost the horse in too poor thing but
selfpreservation is the first law of nature and if hes liable to
perish its no reason we should Im goin to get into that house if
such a things possible

But Auntie

Dont say another word Im responsible for your bein here this night
Emily Howes You wouldnt have come if I hadnt coaxed you into it And
you shant die of pneumonia oror drownin if I can help it Im goin
to have a look at those doors and windows Dont be scared Ill be
back in a jiffy Goodness me what a puddle Well if you hear me holler
youll know Im goin under for the third time so come quick Here
goes

Lantern in hand she splashed out into the wet windy darkness




CHAPTER II


Miss Howes left to share with General Jackson the sociability of the
shed watched that lantern with faint hope and strong anxiety She
saw it bobbing like a gigantic firefly about the walls of the house
stopping here and there and then hurrying on Soon it passed around the
further corner and disappeared altogether The wind howled the rain
poured General Jackson stamped and splashed and Emily shivered

At last just as the watcher had begun to think some serious accident
had happened to her courageous relative and was considering starting on
a relief expedition the lantern reappeared

Emily screamed Mrs Barnes Emily Come here

Emily came fighting her way against the wind She found her cousin
standing by the corner of the house

Ive got it cried Aunt Thankful panting but triumphant Ive
got it One of the windows on the other side is unfastened just as I
suspicioned it might be I think one of us can get in if tother helps

She seized the arm of her fellow castaway and together they turned the
corner struggled on for a short distance and then stopped

This is the window gasped the widow Here right abreast of us
See

She held up the lantern The window was abreast of them but also it
was a trifle high

It aint fastened shouted Thankful she was obliged to shout in order
to be heard I could push it open a little mite from the bottom but
I couldnt reach to get it up all the way You can if I steady you I
guess Here Put your foot on that box I lugged it around from the back
yard on purpose

Standing on an empty and shaky cranberry crate and held there by the
strong arm of Mrs Barnes Emily managed to push up the lower half
of the window The moment she let go of it however it fell with a
tremendous bang

One of the oldfashioned kind you might know declared Thankful No
weights nor nothin Well have to prop it up with a stick You wait
where you are and Ill go get one Theres whats left of a woodpile out
back here thats where that crate came from

She hastened away and was back in a moment with a stout stick Emily
raised the window once more and placed the stick beneath it

There panted her companion Weve got a gangway anyhow Next thing
is to get aboard You come down and give me a boost

But Emily declined

Of course I shant do any such thing she declared indignantly I
can climb through that window a great deal easier than you can Auntie
Im ever so much younger Just give me a push thats all

Her cousin demurred I hate to have you do it she said For anybody
that aint any too strong or well youve been through enough tonight
Well if youre so set on it I presume likely you could make a better
job of climbin than I could It aint my age that bothers me though
its my weight All ready Up you go Humph Its a mercy there aint
anybody lookin on    There all right are you

Emilys head appeared framed by the window sash Yes she panted
II think Im all right At least Im through that window Now what
shall I do

Take this lantern and go to one of the doors and see if you can
unfasten it Try the back door thats the most liable to be only bolted
and hooked The front ones probably locked with a key

The lantern and its bearer disappeared Mrs Barnes plodded around to
the back door As she reached it it opened

It was only hooked said Emily Come in Auntie Come in quick

Thankful had not waited for the invitation she was in already She took
the lantern from her relatives hand Then she shut the door behind her

Whew she exclaimed If it dont seem good to get under cover real
cover What sort of a place is this anyhow Emily

I dont know IIve been too frightened to look II feel like aO
Aunt Thankful dont you feel like a burglar

Me A burglar I feel like a wet dishcloth I never was so soaked with
my clothes on in my life Hello I thought this was an empty house
Theres a stove and a chair such as it is Whoever lived here last
didnt take away all their furniture Lets go into the front rooms

The first room they entered was evidently the diningroom It was quite
bare of furniture The next however that which Emily had entered
by the window contained another stove a ramshackle whatnot and a
brokendown ragged sofa

Oh gasped Miss Howes pointing to the sofa see see This ISNT an
empty house SupposeOh SUPPOSE there were people living here What
would they say to us

For a moment Thankful was staggered Then her commonsense came to her
rescue

Nonsense she said firmly A house with folks livin in it has
somethin in the dininroom besides dust Anyhow its easy enough to
settle that question Wheres that door lead to

She marched across the floor and threw open the door to which she had
pointed

Humph she sniffed Best front parlor The whole shebang smells shut
up and musty enough but theres somethin about a best parlor smell
that would give it away any time Phew I can almost smell wax wreaths
and haircloth even though they have been took away No this is an
empty house all right but Ill make good and sure for your sake Emily
Aint there any stairs to this old rattletrap Oh yes heres the
front hall Hello Hello up there Hii

She was shouting up the oldfashioned staircase Her voice echoed above
with the unmistakable echo of empty rooms Only that echo and the howl
of the wind and roar of rain answered her

She came back to the apartment where she had left her cousin

Its all right Emily she said Were the only passengers aboard the
derelict Now lets see if we cant be more comftable You set down on
that sofa and rest Ive got an idea in my head

The idea evidently involved an examination of the stove for she opened
its rusty door and peered inside Then without waiting to answer her
companions questions she hurried out into the kitchen returning with
an armful of shavings and a few sticks of split pine

I noticed that woodbox in the kitchen when I fust come in she said
And twant quite empty neither though thats more or less of a
miracle Matches Oh yes indeed I never travel without em Ive been
so used to lookin out for myself and other folks that Im a reglar man
in some ways There now lets see if the draft is rusted up as much as
the stove

It was not apparently for with the dampers wide open the fire
crackled and snapped Also it smoked a little

Twill get over that pretty soon prophesied Mrs Barnes I can stand
most any amount of smoke so longs theres heat with it Now Emily
well haul that sofa up alongside and you lay down on it and get rested
and warm Id say get dry too but twould take a reglar blast furnace
to dry a couple of water rats like you and me this night Perhaps we
can dry the upper layer though thatll be some help Now mind me Lay
right down on that sofa

Emily protested She was no wetter and no more tired than her cousin
she said Why should she lie down while Aunt Thankful sat up

Cause I tell you to for one thing said the widow with decision
And because Im well and strong and you aint When I think of how I
got you a half invalid as you might say to come on this crazy trip
Im so provoked I feel like not speakin to myself for a week There
now you LOOK more comftable anyhow If I only had somethin to put
over you Id feel better I wonder if theres an old bed quilt or
anything upstairs Ive a good mind to go and see

Emilys protest was determined this time

Indeed you shant she cried You shant stir I wouldnt have you go
prowling about this poky old place for anything Do you suppose I could
stay down here alone knowing that you might bemight be meeting oror
finding almost anything up there Sit right down in that chair beside
me Dont you think it is almost time for that driver to be back

Land sakesno Hes hardly started yet Its goin to take a good long
spell afore he can wade a mile and a half in such a storm as this and
get another horse and wagon and come back again Hell come by and by
All weve got to do is to stay by this fire and be thankful weve got
it

Emily shivered I suppose so she said And I know I am nervous and a
trial instead of a help If you had only been alone

Alone Heavens to Betey Do you think Id like thisthis campmeetin
any better if I was the only one to it My Just hear that wind Hope
these old chimneys are solid

Auntie what do you suppose that man meant by saying he wouldnt enter
this house at night for anything

Dont know Perhaps he meant hed be afraid of bein arrested

But you dont think well be arrested

No no of course not Id be almost willin to be arrested if theyd
do it quick A nice dry lockup and somethin to eat wouldnt be so
bad would it But no constable but a webfooted one would be out this
night Now do as I sayyou lay still and give your nerves a rest

For a few moments the order was obeyed Then Miss Rowes said with
another shiver I do believe this is the worst storm I have ever
experienced

Tis pretty bad thats a fact Do you know Emily if I was a believer
in signs such as mentioned a little while ago I might almost be tempted
to believe this storm was one of em About every big change in my life
has had a storm mixed up with it comin at the time it happened or
just afore or just after I was born so my mother used to tell me on a
stormy night about like this one And it poured great guns the day I was
married And Eben my husband went down with his vessel in a hurricane
off Hatteras And when poor Jedediah run off to go golddiggin there
was such a snowstorm the next day that I expected to see him plowin his
way home again Poor old Jed I wonder where he is tonight Lets see
six years ago that was I wonder if hes been frozen to death or eat up
by polar bears or what One things sartin he aint made his fortune
or hed have come home to tell me of it Last words he said to me was
Im agoin no matter what you say And when I come back loaded down
with money youll be glad to see me

Jedediah Cahoon was Mrs Barnes only near relative a brother Always a
visionary easygoing impractical little man he had never been willing
to stick at steady employment but was always chasing rainbows and
depending upon his sister for a home and means of existence When
the Klondike gold fever struck the country he was one of the first to
succumb to the disease And after an argumentviolent on his part
and determined on Thankfulshe had left South Middleboro and
gonesomewhere From that somewhere he had never returned

Yes mused Mrs Barnes those were the last words he said to me

What did you say to him asked Emily drowsily She had heard the
story often enough but she asked the question as an aid to keeping
awake

Hey What did I say Oh I said my part I guess When you come back
says I itll be when I send money to you to pay your fare home and I
shant do it Ive sewed and washed and cooked for you ever since Eben
died to say nothin of goin out nursin and housekeepin to earn money
to buy somethin TO cook Now Im through This is my houseor at
any rate I pay the rent for it If you leave it to go golddiggin you
neednt come back to it If you do you wont be let in Of course I
never thought hed go but he did Ah hum Im afraid I didnt do
right I ought to have realized that he want really accountable poor
weakheaded critter

Emilys eyes were fast shutting but she made one more remark

Your life has been a hard one hasnt it Auntie she said

Thankful protested Oh no no she declared No hardern anybody
elses I guess likely This world has more hards than softs for the
average mortal and I never flattered myself on bein above the average
But there How in the nation did I get onto this subject You and
me settin here on other folkss furnitureor what was furniture
oncesoppin wet through and half froze and me talkin about troubles
thats all dead and done with What DID get me started Oh yes the
storm I was just thinkin how most of the important things in my life
had had bad weather mixed up with em Come to think of it it rained
the day Mrs Pearson was buried And her dyin was what set me to
thinkin of cruisin down here to East Wellmouth and lookin at the
property Uncle Abner left me Ive never laid eyes on that property and
I dont even know what the house looks like I might have asked that
depotwagon driver but I thought twas no use tellin him my private
affairs so I said we was bound to the hotel and let it go at that
If I had asked he might at least have told me where    Hey
Whywhymy land I never thought of it but it might be It might
Emily

But Miss Howes eyes were closed now In spite of her wet garments and
her nervousness concerning their burglarious entry of the empty house
she had fallen asleep Thankful did not attempt to wake her Instead she
tiptoed to the kitchen and the woodbox took from the latter the last
few slabs of pine wood and returning filled the stove to the top Then
she sat down in the chair once more

For some time she sat there her hands folded in her lap Occasionally
she glanced about the room and her lips moved as if she were talking to
herself Then she rose and peered out of the window Rain and blackness
and storm were without but nothing else She returned to the sofa and
stood looking down at the sleeper Emily stirred a little and shivered

That shiver helped to strengthen the fears in Mrs Barnes mind The
girl was not strong She had come home from her school duties almost
worn out A trip such as this had been was enough to upset even the most
robust constitution She was wet and cold Sleeping in wet clothes was
almost sure to bring on the dreaded pneumonia If only there might be
something in that house something dry and warm with which to cover her

Emily said Thankful in a low tone Emily

The sleeper did not stir Mrs Barnes took up the lantern Its flame was
much less bright than it had been and the wick sputtered She held the
lantern to her ear and shook it gently The feeble swash that answered
the shake was not reassuring The oil was almost gone

Plainly if exploring of those upper rooms was to be done it must be done
at once With one more glance at the occupant of the sofa Mrs Barnes
lantern in hand tiptoed from the room through the barren front hall
and up the stairs The stairs creaked abominably Each creak echoed like
the crack of doom

At the top of the stairs was another hall long and narrow extending
apparently the whole length of the house At intervals along this hall
were doors One after the other Thankful opened them The first gave
entrance to a closet with a battered and ancient silk hat and a
pasteboard box on the shelf The next opened into a large room
evidently the spare bedroom It was empty So was the next and the next
and the next No furniture of any kind Thankfuls hope of finding
a quilt or a wornout blanket anything which would do to cover her
sleeping and shivering relative grew fainter with the opening of each
door

There were an astonishing number of rooms and closets Evidently this
had been a big commodious and comfortable house in its day But that
day was long past its sunset Now the bigness only emphasized the
dreariness and desolation Dampness and spider webs everywhere cracks
in the ceiling paper peeling from the walls And around the gables and
against the dormerwindows of these upper rooms the gale shrieked and
howled and wailed like a drove of banshees

The room at the very end of the long hall was a large one It was at
the back of the house and there were windows on two sides of it It was
empty like the others and Mrs Barnes reluctantly deciding that her
exploration in quest of coverings had been a failure was about to turn
and retrace her steps to the stairs when she noticed another door

It was in the corner of the room furthest from the windows and was shut
tight A closet probably and all the closets she had inspected so
far had contained nothing but rubbish However Thankful was not in the
habit of doing things by halves so the feebly sputtering lantern held
in her left hand she opened the door with the other and looked in Then
she uttered an exclamation of joy

It was not a closet behind that door but another room A small room
with but one little window low down below the slope of the ceiling
But this room was to some extent furnished There was a bed in it and a
rocking chair and one or two pictures hanging crookedly upon the wall
Also and this was the really important thing upon that bed was a
patchwork comforter

Thankful made a dash for that comforter She set the lantern down upon
the floor and snatched the gayly colored thing from the bed And as she
did so she heard a groan

There are always noises in an empty house especially an old house
Creaks and cracks and rustlings mysterious and unexplainable When the
wind blows these noises are reenforced by a hundred others In this
particular house on this particular night there were noises enough
goodness knows Howls and rattles and moans and shrieks Every shutter
and every shingle seemed to be loose and complaining of the fact As for
groansold hinges groan when the wind blows and so do rickety gutters
and water pipes But this groan or so it seemed to Mrs Barnes had a
different and distinct quality of its own It soundedyes it sounded
human

Thankful dropped the patchwork comforter

Whos that she asked sharply

There was no answer No sounds except those of the storm Thankful
picked up the comforter

Humph she said aloudtalking to herself was a habit developed during
the years of housekeeping for deaf old Mrs Pearson Humph I must be
gettin nerves I guess

She began folding the old quilt in order to make it easier to carry
downstairs And then she heard another groan or sigh or combination
of both It sounded not outside the window or outside the house but in
that very room

Again Mrs Barnes dropped the comforter Also she went out of the room
But she did not go far Halfway across the floor of the adjoining room
she stopped and put her foot down physically and mentally

Fool she said disgustedly Then turning on her heel she marched
back to the little bedroom and picked up the lantern its flame had
dwindled to the feeblest of feeble sparks

Now then said Thankful with determination whoeveroror whatever
thing you are thats makin that noise you might just as well show
yourself If youre hidin youd better come out for Ill find you

But no one or no thing came out Thankful waited a moment and then
proceeded to give that room a very thorough lookingover It was such
a small apartment that the process took but little time There was no
closet Except for the one window and the door by which she had entered
the four walls covered with oldfashioned ugly paper had no openings
of any kind There could be no attic or empty space above the ceiling
because she could hear the rain upon the sloping roof She looked under
the bed and found nothing but dust She looked in the bed even under
the rockingchair

Well there she muttered I said it and I was right I AM gettin
to be a nervous old fool Im glad Emily aint here to see me And yet I
didI swear I did hear somethin

The pictures on the wall by the window caught her eye She walked over
and looked at them The lantern gave so little light that she could
scarcely see anything but she managed to make out that one was a dingy
chromo with a Scriptural subject The other was a battered crayon
enlargement a portrait of a man a middleaged man with a chin beard
There was something familiar about the face in the portrait Something

Thankful gasped Uncle Abner she cried Whywhy

Then the lantern flame gave a last feeble sputter and went out She
heard the groan again And in that room the room she had examined so
carefully so close as to seem almost at her very ear a faint voice
wailed agonizingly Oh Lord

Thankful went away She left the comforter and the lantern upon the
floor and she did not stop to close the door of the little bedroom
Through the black darkness of the long hall she rushed and down the
creaky stairs Her entrance to the sittingroom was more noisy than her
exit had been and Miss Howes stirred upon the sofa and opened her eyes

Auntie she cried sharply Aunt Thankful where are you

ImIm here Emily That is I guessyes Im here

But why is it so dark Where is the lantern

The lantern Mrs Barnes was trying to speak calmly but between
agitation and loss of breath she found it hard work The lantern
Whyitsits gone she said

Gone What do you mean Where has it gone

Its gonegone out There want enough oil in it to last any longer
I suppose

Oh Emily sat up And youve been sitting here alone in the dark
while I have been asleep How dreadful for you Why didnt you speak to
me Has anything happened Hasnt that man come back yet

It was the last question which Thankful answered No No he aint come
back yet she said But he will pretty soon Im sure Hehe will
Emily dont you fret

Oh Im not worried Auntie I am too sleepy to worry I guess

Sleepy Youre not goin to sleep AGAIN are you

Mrs Barnes didnt mean to ask this question certainly she did not
mean to ask it with such evident anxiety Emily noticed the tone and
wondered

Why no she said I think not Of course Im not But what made you
speak in that way Youre not frightened are you

Thankful made a brave effort

Frightened she repeated stoutly What on earth should I be
frightened of Id like to know

Why nothing I hope

I should say not IGood heavens above Whats that

She started and clutched her companion by the arm They both listened

I dont hear anything but the storm said Emily Why Auntie you ARE
frightened youre trembling I do believe there is something

Thankful snatched her hand away

There isnt she declared Of course there isnt

Then why are you so nervous

Me Nervous Emily Howes dont you ever say that to me again I aint
nervous and I aint goin to be nervous Theres nono sane reason why
I should be and I shant I shant

But Auntie you are Oh what is it

Nothin Nothin at all I tell you The idea with an attempt at a
laugh The idea of you thinkin Im nervous Young folks like you or
rich old women are the only ones who can afford nerves I aint either
young nor rich

Emily laughed too This speech was natural and characteristic

If you were a nervous wreck she said it would be no wonder all
alone in the dark as you have been in a deserted house like this I
cant forgive myself for falling asleep Whose house do you suppose it
is

Aunt Thankful did not answer Emily went on Her short nap had revived
her courage and spirit

Perhaps it is a haunted house she said jokingly Every village has
a haunted house you know Perhaps thats why the stagedriver warned us
not to go into it

To her surprise Mrs Barnes seemed to take offense at this attempt at
humor

Dont talk silly she snapped If Ive lived all these years and
been as down on spooks and longhaired mediums as Ive been and then
totherethere Dont lets be idiots altogether Talk about somethin
else Talk about that depotwagon driver and his pesky gocart that got
us into this mess Theres plenty of things Id like to say about THEM

They talked in low tones Conversation there in the dark and under such
circumstances was rather difficult Emily although she was determined
not to admit it was growing alarmed for the return of Winnie S and
his promised rescue expedition Aunt Thankful was thinking of the little
back bedroom upstairs An utter lack of superstition was something upon
which she had prided herself But now as she thought of that room of
the portrait on the wall and what she had heard

Listen whispered Emily suddenly Listen II thought I heard
something

Mrs Barnes leaned forward

What Where Upstairs she asked breathlessly

No Outout there somewhere She pointed in the direction of the
front hall It sounded as if someone had tried the front door Hark
There it is again

Aunt Thankful rose to her feet I heard it too she said Its
probably that driver man come back Ill go and see

Nono Auntie you mustnt II shant let you

I shall I shall I tell you If Ive got any commonsense at all
I aint goin to be scared ofOf course its that driver man Hes
wonderin where we are and hes lookin for us Ill go let him in

She broke away from Miss Howes grasp and started for the front hall
The action was a braver one than her cousin realized If there was one
thing on earth that Thankful Barnes did not wish to do at that moment
it was to go nearer the stairs landing to the rooms above

But she went and Emily went with her Cautiously they peered through
the little windows at the sides of the front door There was no one in
sight and listening they heard nothing

II guess we was mistaken Emily whispered Thankful Lets go back
to the fire

But Auntie I DID hear something Didnt you

Well I thought I did but I guessOh DONT stay here another minute
II shall be hearin most anything if we do

They returned to the room they had left But they had scarcely entered
it when they stopped short and clinging to each other listened

It was the latch of the kitchen door they heard click now And the door
was opening In the kitchen they heard the sounds of cautious footsteps
footsteps which entered the diningroom which came on toward the
sittingroom And a voice a mans voice whispered

I told you so II told you so I said I see a light Andand that
door was undone andandBy time Obed Bangs you can go on if you want
to but I tell you youre riskin your life II aint goin to stay
no longer Im goin to fetch the constableoror the minister or
somebody I

Another voice interrupted

Shut up Belay it ordered If theres anybody or anything in this
house well have a look at it thats all You can go to the minister
afterwards if you want to Just now youll come along with me if I have
to haul you by the neck Lets see whats in here

There was a flash of light in the crack of the door leading from the
diningroom That door was thrown open and the light became a blaze from
a big lantern held aloft

Hey What exclaimed the second voice Whowomen by the
everlastin

Mrs Barnes and Emily clinging to each other blinked in the lantern
light

Women Two women said the voice again

Thankful answered The voice was real and it came from a human throat
Anything humanand visibleshe did not fear

Yes she said crisply were women What of it Who are you

The man with the lantern entered the room He was big and
broadshouldered and bearded His companion was short and stout and
smoothfaced also he appeared very much frightened Both men wore
oilskin coats and souwesters

Who are you repeated Aunt Thankful

The big man answered His sunburned goodhumored face was wrinkled and
puckered with amazement

Well he stammered IweHumph well were neighbors
andbutbut I dont know as I know you maam do I

I dont know why you should I dont know you furs that goes What
are you doin here Did that depotwagon man send you

Depotwagon man No maam nobody sent us KenelmerMr Parker
here saw a light a spell ago and bein as this house is supposed to be
empty he

Wait a minute Miss Howes interrupted Whose house is this

Whywhy it aint anybodys house maam That is nobody lives here

But somebody used to live here its likely What was his name

His name Well old Laban Eldredge used to live here The house belongs
to Captain Abner Cahoons heirs I believe and

Again Thankful interrupted

I knew it she cried excitedly I wondered if it mightnt be so
and when I see that picture of Uncle Abner I was sure All right
Mr Whoeveryouare then Im here because I own the house My names
Barnes Thankful Barnes of South Middleboro and Im Abner Cahoons
heir Emily thisthis rattletrap you and I broke into is the
property weve talked so much about




CHAPTER III


Emily saidwell the first thing she said was Oh Aunt Thankful
Then she added that she couldnt believe it

Its so declared Mrs Barnes whether we believe it or not When you
come to think it over theres nothin so wonderful about it after all
I had a sneakin suspicion when I was sittin here by you after youd
gone to sleep What I saw afterwards made me almost sure IHum I
guess likely thatll keep till we get to the hotel if we ever do get
there Perhaps MrMr

Bangs is my name maam said the big man with the lantern Obed
Bangs

Thank you Mr Bangs Or its Capn Bangs aint it

They generally call me Capn maam though I aint been doin any
active seafarin for some time

I thought as much Down here on Cape Cod and givin orders the way I
heard you afore you come into this room twas nine chances to one you
was a capn or you had been one BangsBangsObed Bangs Why that
name sounds kind of familiar Seems as ifCapn Bangs you didnt use
to know Eben Barnes of Provincetown did you

Eben Barnes Capn Eben of the White Foam lost off Cape Hatteras in a
gale

Yes thats the one I thought I heard him speak of you He was my
husband

Captain Obed Bangs uttered an exclamation Then he stepped forward and
seized Mrs Barnes hand The ladys hand was not a very small one but
the Captains was so large that as Thankful remarked afterward it
might have shaken hers twice at the same time

Eben Barnes wife exclaimed Captain Obed Why Eben and I was
messmates on I dont know how many vyages Well well well maam Im
real glad to see you

You aint so glad as we are to see youand your friend observed
Thankful drily Is he a captain too

He didnt look like one certainly He had removed his souwester
uncovering a round head with reddishgray hair surrounding a bald spot
at the crown He had a double chin and a smile which was apologetic but
ingratiating He seemed less frightened than when he first entered the
room but still glanced about him with evident apprehension

Nono maam he stammered in answer to the question No maam
IImy names Parker II aint a capn no maam

Kenelm aint been promoted yet observed Captain Obed gravely Hes
waitin until he gets old enough to go to sea Aint that it Kenelm

Kenelm smiled and shifted his souwester from his right hand to his
left

II callate so he answered

Well it dont make any difference declared Thankful My cousin
and I are just as glad to see him as if he was an admiral Weve been
waitin so long to see any human bein that wed begun to think they was
all drowned But you havent met my cousin yet Her names Howes

Emily who had stood by patient but chilly during the introductions
and reminiscences shook hands with Captain Bangs and Mr Parker Both
gentlemen said they were pleased to meet her no Captain Obed said
thatKenelm said that he was glad to be acquaintanced

I dont know as we hadnt ought to beg your pardon for creepin in on
you this way said the captain We thought the house was empty We
didnt know you was visitin youryour property

Well so far as that goes neither did we I dont wonder you expected
to find burglars or tramps or whatever you did expect Weve had an
awful time this night aint we Emily

We certainly have declared Miss Howes with emphasis

Yes you see

She gave a brief history of the cruise and wreck of the depotwagon
Also of their burglarious entry of the house

And now Capn she said in conclusion if you could think up any
way of our gettin to that hotel wed be ever so much obliged   
Hello Theres that driver I do believe And about time I should say

From without came the sound of wheels and the voice of Winnie S
hailing his missing passengers

Hi Hii Where be ye

Hell wear his lungs out screamin that way snapped Thankful Cant
he see the light for goodness sakes

Captain Obed answered He couldnt see nothin unless twas hung on the
end of his nose he said That boys eyes and brains aint connected
Here Kenelm turning to Mr Parker you go out and tell Win to shut
down on his fog whistle hes wastin steam Tell him the womenfolks
are in here Look alive now

Kenelm looked alive but not much more than that

All right Capn he stammered Aaall right Whatwhatshall I
saywhat shall Ihad I better

Thunderation Do you need a chart and compass Stay where you are Ill
say it myself

He strode to the window threw it open and shouted in a voice which had
been trained to carry above worse gales than the present one

Ahoy Ahoy Win Fetch her around aft here Lay alongside the kitchen
door Dyou hear Ahoy Win dyou hear

Silence Then after a moment came the reply Yup I hear ye Be right
there

The captain turned from the window

Took some time for him to let us know he heard didnt it he
observed Callate he had to say Judas priest four or five times
afore he answered If you cut all the Judas priests out of that boys
talk hed be next door to tonguetied

Thankful turned to her relative

There Emily she said with a sigh of relief I guess likely well
make the hotel this tack I begun to think we never would

Captain Bangs shook his head

You wont go to no hotel this night he said decidedly Its a long
ways off and pretty poor harbor after you make it Youll come right
along with me and Kenelm to his sisters house Its only a little
ways and Hannahs got a spare room and shell be glad to have you Im
boardin there myself just now Yes you will he added Of course you
will Suppose Im goin to let relations of Eben Barnes put up at the
East Wellmouth tavern By the everlastin I guess not I wouldnt send
aa Democrat there Come right along Dont say another word

Both of the ladies said other words a good many of them but they might
as well have been orders to the wind to stop blowing Captain Obed Bangs
was evidently a person accustomed to having his own way Even as they
were still protesting their new acquaintance led them to the kitchen
door where Winnie S and a companion a longlegged person who answered
to the name of Jabez were waiting on the front seat of a vehicle
attached to a dripping and dejected horse To the rear of this vehicle
General Jackson was tethered by a halter Winnie S was loaded to the
guards with exclamatory explanations

Judas priest he exclaimed as the captain assisted Mrs Barnes and
Emily into the carriage If I aint glad to see you folks When I got
back here and there want a sign of you nowheres I was took some off
my pins I tell ye Didnt know what to do I says to Jabez I says

Captain Obed interrupted Never mind what you said to Jabez Win he
said Why didnt you get back sooner Thats what we want to know

Winnie S was righteously indignant Sooner he repeated Judas
priest I tell ye right now Im lucky to get back at all Took me pretty
nigh an hour to get to the village Such travelin I never see Tried to
save time by takin the short cut acrost the meadow and there aint no
meadow no more Its three foot under water You never see such a tide
So back I had to frog it and when I got far as Jabes house all hands
had turned in I had to pretty nigh bust the door down fore I could
wake anybody up Then Jabe he had to get dressed and we had to harness
up andhey Did you say anything maam

The question was addressed to Mrs Barnes who had been vainly trying to
ask one on her own account

I say have you got our valises asked Thankful Last I saw of them
they was in that other wagon the one that broke down

The driver slapped his knee Judas priest he cried I forgot all
about them satchels Here Jabe handing the reins to his companion
You take the hellum while I run back and fetch em

He was back in a few moments with the missing satchels Then Jabez
who was evidently not given to wasting words drawled Did you get the
mail Thats in there too aint it

Judas priest So tis Why didnt you remind me of it afore Set there
likelike a wooden figurehead and let me run my legs off

His complaints died away in the distance At last with the mail bag
under the seat the caravan moved on It was still raining but not
so hard and the wind blew less fiercely They jogged and rocked and
splashed onward Suddenly Winnie S uttered another shout

The lantern he cried Wheres that lantern I lent ye

Its there in the house said Thankful It burned itself out and I
forgot it Mercy on us Youre not goin back after that I hope

Well I dunno That lantern belongs to the old mandad I meanand he
sets a lot of store by it If Ive lost that lantern on him let alone
leavin his depotwagon all stove up hell give me

Never mind what hell give you broke in Captain Bangs You keep on
your course or ILL give you somethin Dont you say another word till
we get abreast of Hannah Parkers

Humph Were there now I thought these folks was goin to our hotel

Take my advice and dont think so much Youll open a seam in your
head and founder first thing you know Here we are And heres Hannah
Hannah Kenelm and Ive brought you a couple of lodgers Now maam if
youll stand by Kenelm open that hatch

Mr Parker opened the hatchthe door of the carriageand the captain
assisted the passengers to alight Emily caught a glimpse of the white
front of a little house and of a tall angular woman standing in the
doorway holding a lamp Then she and Mrs Barnes were propelled by
the strong arms of their pilot through that doorway and into a little
sittingroom bright and warm and cheery

There declared Captain Obed That cruise is over Kenelm Where is
Kenelm Oh there you are You tell that Winnie S to trot along Well
settle for passage tomorrow mornin Now maam turning to Thankful
you and your relation want to make yourselves as comftable as you can
This is Miss Parker Kenelms sister Hannah this is Mrs Barnes Eben
Barnes widow Youve heard me speak of him And this is Miss Howes I
callate theyre hungry and I know theyre wet Seemss if dry clothes
and supper might be the next items on the manifest

Miss Parker rose to the occasion She flew about preparing the items
Thankful and Emily were shown to the spare room hot water and towels
were provided the valise was brought in When the ladies again made
their appearance in the sittingroom they were arrayed in dry warm
garments partly their own and partly supplied from the wardrobe of
their hostess As to the fit of these latter Mrs Barnes expressed her
opinion when she said

Dont look at me Emily I feel like a barrel squeezed into an umbrella
cover This dress is long enough land knows but thats about all you
can say of it However I suppose we hadnt ought toto look a gift
dress in the waistband

Supper was ready in the diningroom and thither they were piloted by
Kenelm whose hair what there was of it was elaborately slicked
down and whose celluloid collar had evidently received a scrubbing In
the diningroom they found Captain Bangs awaiting them Miss Parker made
her appearance bearing a steaming teapot Hannah now that they had an
opportunity to inspect her was seen to be as tall and sharpfeatured
as her brother was short and round She was at least fifteen years older
than he but she moved much more briskly Also she treated Kenelm as
she might have treated a child an only child who needed constant
suppression

Please to be seated everybody she said Capn Obed you take your
reglar place Mrs Barnes if youll be so kind as to set here and
Miss Howes next to you Kenelm you set side of me Set down dont
stand there fidgetin WHAT did you put on that necktie for I told you
to put on the red one

Kenelm fingered his tie II callate I must have forgot Hannah he
stammered I never noticed This ones all right aint it

All right Itll have to be You cant change it now But for goodness
sakes look out it stays on The elastics all worn loose and its
lible to drop into your tea or anywheres else Now with a sudden
change from a family to a company manner may I assist you to a piece
of the cold ham Miss Howes I trust you are feelin quite restored to
yourself again

Emilys answer being in the affirmative their hostess continued

Im so sorry to be obliged to set nothin but cold ham and toast and
tea before you she said If I had known you was comin I should have
prepared somethin more fittin After such an experience as you must
have been through this night to set down to ham and toast II declare
I feel real debilitated and ashamed to offer em to you

Thankful answered

Dont say a word Miss Parker she said heartily Were the ones
that ought to be ashamed Landin on you this way in the middle of the
night Youre awfully good to take us in at all My cousin and I were
on our way to the hotel but Capn Bangs wouldnt hear of it Hes
responsible for our comin here

Miss Parker nodded

Capn Obed is the most hospital soul livin she said grandly He
done just right If hed done anything else Kenelm and I would have felt
hurt ILook out with a sudden snatch at her brothers shirt front
There goes that tie Another second and twould have been right in your
plate

Kenelm snapped the loop of the made tie over his collar button Dont
grab at me that way Hannah he protested mildly Im kind of nervous
tonight after what Ive been through Twouldnt have done no great
harm if I had dropped it I could pick it up again couldnt I

You could but I doubt if you would You might have ate it youre
so absentminded Nervous YOU nervous What do you think of me Mrs
Barnes turning to Thankful and once more resuming the company
manner youll excuse our bein a little upset You see when my
brother came home and said hed seen lights movin around in the old
Barnes house he frightened us all pretty near to death All Capn Obed
could think of was tramps or thieves or somethin Nothin would do but
he must drag Kenelm right back to see who or what was in there And I
was left alone to imagine all sorts of dreadful things Tramps I might
stand They belong to this world anyhow But in THAT house at eleven
oclock at night IMrs Barnes do you believe in aberrations

Thankful was nonplused Inin which she asked

In aberrations spirits of dead folks comin alive again

For just a moment Mrs Barnes hesitated Then she glanced at Emily
who was trying hard not to smile and answered with decision No I
dont

Well I dont either so far as that goes I never see one myself and
Ive never seen anybody that has But when Kenelm came tearin in to say
hed seen a light in a house shut up as long as that one has been and a
house that folks

Captain Bangs interrupted He had been regarding Thankful closely and
now he changed the subject

How did it happen you saw that light Kenelm he asked What was you
doin over in that direction a night like this

Kenelm hesitated He seemed to find it difficult to answer

Whywhy he stammered Id been up to the office after the mail
Andandit was so late comin that I give it up I says to Lemuel
Ryder Lem I says

His sister broke in

Lem Ryder she repeated Was he at the postoffice

Wellwell Kenelms confusion was more marked than ever
Wellwell he stammered I see him and I says

You see him Where did you see him Kenelm Parker I dont believe you
was at the postoffice at all You was at the clubroom thats where you
was At that clubroom smokin and playin cards with that deprivated
crowd of loafers and gamblers Tell me the truth now wasnt you

Mr Parkers tie fell off then but neither he nor his sister noticed
it

Gamblers he snorted There aint no gamblers there Playin a hand
or two of Californy Jack just for fun aint gamblin I wouldnt gamble
not for a million dollars

Captain Obed laughed Neither would I he observed Nor for two
cents with that clubroom gang twould be too much nerve strain
collectin my winnins I see now why you come by the Barnes house
Kenelm Its the nighest way home from that clubhouse Well Im glad
you did Mrs Barnes and Miss Howes would have had a long session in the
dark if you hadnt Yes and a night at Darius Holts hotel which would
have been a heap worse So youve been livin at South Middleboro Mrs
Barnes have you Does Miss Howes live there too

Thankful very grateful for the change of topic told of her life since
her husbands death of her long stay with Mrs Pearson of Emilys
teaching school and their trip aboard the depotwagon

Well exclaimed Miss Parker when she had finished you have been
through enough I should say A reglar storybook adventure aint it
Lost in a storm and shut up in an empty house the one you come purpose
to see Its a mercy you want either of you hurt climbin in that
window the way you did You might have broke your arms or your necks
or somethin Mr Alpheus Bassett down to the Pointa great strong
fleshy man weighs close to two hundred and fifty and never sick a
day in his lifehe was up in the second story of his buildin walkin
around spry as anybodyall alone which he shouldnt have been at his
ageand he stepped on a fish and away he went And the next thing we
hear hes in bed with his collarbone Did you ever hear anything like
that in your life Miss Howes

It was plain that Emily never had IIm afraid I dont understand
she faltered You say he was in the second story of a building and he
stepped onon a FISH

Yes just a mackerel twas and not a very big one they tell me At
first they was afraid twas the spine hed broke but it turned out to
be only the collarbone though thats bad enough

Captain Obed burst into a laugh Twant the mackerels collarbone
Miss Howes he explained though I presume likely that was broke too
if Alpheus stepped on it He was up in the loft of his fish shanty icin
and barrelin fish to send to Boston and he fell downstairs Wonder it
didnt kill him

Miss Parker nodded Thats what I say she declared And
Sarahthats his wifetells me the doctors are real worried because
the fraction aint ignited yet

Thankful coughed and then observed that she should think they would be

If you dont mind she added I think its high time all hands went
to bed It must be way along into the small hours and if we set here any
longer itll be time for breakfast You folks must be tired settin up
this way and Im sure Emily and I am If we turn in now we may have a
chance to look over that precious property of mine afore we go back to
South Middleboro I dont know though as we havent seen enough of it
already It dont look very promisin to me

The captain rose from the table and walking to the window pushed aside
the shade

Itll look better tomorrowtoday I should say he observed The
storms about over and the winds hauled to the westard Well have a
spell of fair weather now I guess That property of yours Mrs Barnes
ll look a lot more promisin in the sunshine Theres no better view
along shore than from the front windows of that house Taint half bad
that old house aint All it needs is fixin up

Good nightsgood mornings for it was after two oclockwere said and
the guests withdrew to their bedroom Once inside with the door shut
Thankful and Emily looked at each other and both burst out laughing

Oh dear me gasped the former wiping her eyes Maybe its mean to
laugh at folks thats been as kind to us as these Parkers have been but
I never had such a job keepin a straight face in my life When she said
she was debilitated at havin to give us ham and toast that was funny
enough but what come afterwards was funnier The fraction aint
ignited yet and the doctors are worried I should think theyd be more
worried if it had

Emily shook her head I am glad I didnt have to answer that remark
Auntie she said I never could have done it without disgracing
myself She is a genuine Mrs Malaprop isnt she

This was a trifle too deep for Mrs Barnes who replied that she didnt
know she having never met the Mrs Whatshername to whom her cousin
referred Shes a genuine curiosity this Parker woman if thats what
you mean Emily she said And sos her brother though a different
kind of one We must get Capn Bangs to tell us more about em in the
mornin He thinks thatthat heirloom house of mine will look better
in the daylight Well I hope hes right it looked hopeless enough
tonight what I could see of it

I like that Captain Bangs observed Emily

So do I It seems as if wed known him for ever so long And how his
saltwater talk does take me back Seems as if I was hearin my father
and Uncle Abneryes and Eben toospeakin And it is so sort of good
and natural to be callin somebody Capn I was brought up amongst
capns and I guess Ive missed em moren I realized Now you must go
to sleep youll need all the sleep you can get and that wont be much
Good night

Good night said Emily sleepily A few minutes later she said
Auntie what did become of that lantern our driver was so anxious
about The last I saw of it it was on the floor by the sofa where I was
lying But I didnt seem to remember it after the captain and Mr Parker
came

Mrs Barnes reply was if not prompt at least conclusive

Its over there somewhere she said The light went out but it aint
likely the lantern went with it Now you go to sleep

Miss Howes obeyed She was asleep very soon thereafter But Thankful lay
awake thinking and wonderingyes and dreading What sort of a place
was this she had inherited She distinctly did not believe in
what Hannah Parker had called aberrations but she had heard
somethingsomething strange and inexplicable in that little back
bedroom The groans might have been caused by the gale but no gale
spoke English or spoke at all for that matter Who or what was it
that had said Oh Lord in the darkness and solitude of that bedroom




CHAPTER IV


Thankful opened her eyes The sunlight was streaming in at the window
Beneath that window hens were clucking noisily Also in the room
adjoining someone was talking protesting

I dont know Hannah said Mr Parkers voice I tell you I dont
know where it is If I knew Id tell you wouldnt I I dont seem to
remember what I done with it

Well then youve got to set down and not stir till you do remember
thats all When you went out of this house last evenin to go to the
postofficeOh yes To the postofficethats where you said you
was goinyou had the lantern and that umbrella When you came back
hollerin about the light you see in the Capn Abner house you had the
lantern But the umbrella you didnt have Now where is it

I dont know Hannah IIdo seem to remember havin had it but

Well Im glad you remember that much You lost one of your mittens
too but twas an old one so I dont mind that so much But that
umbrella was your Christmas present and twas good gloria silk with
a real giltplated handle I paid two dollars and a quarter for that
umbrella and I told you never to take it out in a storm because you
were likely to turn it inside out and spile it If Id seen you take it
last night Id have stopped you but you was gone afore I missed it

Butbut consarn it all Hannah

Dont swear Kenelm Profanity wont help you none

I want swearin All I say is whats the use of an umbrella if you
cant hist it in a storm I wouldnt give a darn for a schooner load of
em when twas fair weather II callate II left it somewheres

I callate you did Im goin over to the village this mornin and Ill
stop in at that clubhouse myself

II dont believe its at the clubhouse Hannah

You dont Why dont you

II dont know I just guess it aint thats all Somethin seems to
tell me taint

Oh it does hey I want to know Hum Was you anywheres else last
night Answer me the truth now Kenelm Parker Was you anywheres else
last night

Anywheres else What do you mean by that

I mean what I say You know what I mean well enough Was youwell was
you callin on anybody

Callin on anybody CALLIN on em

Yes callin on em Oh you neednt look so innocent and buttery
You aint above it Aint I had experience Havent I been through it
Didnt you use to say that I your sister thats been a mother to you
was the only woman in this world for you and then the minute I was out
of sight and hardly out of hearin you

My soul Youve got Abbie Larkin in your head again aint you
ItitI swear its a reglar disease with you seems so Aint I told
you I aint seen Abbie Larkin nor her me for the land knows how long
And I dont want to see her My time Do you suppose I waded and paddled
a mile and a quarter down to call on Abbie Larkin a night like last
night What do you think I ama bull frog I wouldnt do it to see
thethe Queen of Rooshy

This vehement outburst seemed to have some effect Miss Parkers tone
was more conciliatory

Well all right she said I spose likely you didnt call on her if
you say so Kenelm I suppose I am a foolish lone woman But O Kenelm
I do think such a sight of you And you know youve got money and that
Abbie Larkin is so worldly shed marry you for it in a minute I didnt
know but you might have met her

Met her Tuttuttut If that aintand in a typhoon like last
night Oh sartin I met her I was up here on top of Meetinhouse
Hill larnin her to swim in the mud puddles You do talk so silly
sometimes Hannah

Maybe I do with a sniff Maybe I do Kenelm but you mean so much to
me I just cant let you go

Go I aint goin nowheres am I What kind of talks that

And to think youd heave away that umbrellathe umbrella I gave you
Thats what makes me feel so bad A nice new giltplated umbrella

I never hove it away IIwell I left it somewheres II callate
Ill go look for it after breakfast Say when are we goin to have
breakfast anyhow Its almost eight oclock now Aint them womenfolks
EVER goin to turn out

Thankful had heard enough She was out of bed the next instant

Emily Emily she cried Its late We must get up now

The voices in the sittingroom died to whispers

II cant help it pleaded Kenelm I never meant nothin I thought
they was asleep And TIS most eight By time Hannah you do pick on
me

A vigorous Sshh interrupted him The door between the sittingroom
and diningroom closed with a slam Mrs Barnes and Emily dressed
hurriedly

They gathered about the breakfast table the Parkers Captain Obed and
the guests Miss Parkers company manner was again much in evidence
and she seemed to feel it her duty to lead the conversation She
professed to have discovered a striking resemblance between Miss Howes
and a deceased relative of her own named Melinda Ellis

The more I see of you Miss Howes she declared the more I cant
help thinkin of poor Melindy She was pretty and had dark eyes and hair
sames youve got and that same sort ofof consumptic look to her Not
that youve got consumption I dont mean that Only you look the way
she done thats all She did have consumption poor thing Everybody
thought shed die of it but she didnt She got up in the night to take
some medicine and she took the wrong kindtoothache lotion it was and
awful powerfuland it ate right through to her diagram She didnt live
long afterwards poor soul

No one said anything for a moment after this tragic recital Then
Captain Bangs observed cheerfully

Well I guess Miss Howes aint likely to drink any toothache lotion

Hannah nodded sedately I trust not she said But accidents do
happen And Melindy and Miss Howes look awful like each other Youre
real well I hope Miss Howes After bein exposed the way you was last
night I HOPE you havent caught cold You never can tell whatll follow
a coldwith some people

Thankful was glad when the meal was over She too was fearful that her
cousin might have taken cold during the wet chill of the previous night
But Emily declared she was very well indeed that the very sight of the
sunlit sea through the diningroom windows had acted like a tonic

Good enough exclaimed Captain Obed heartily Then we ought to be
gettin a bigger dose of that tonic Mrs Barnes if you and Miss Howes
would like to walk over and have a look at that property of yours nows
as good a time as any to be doin it Ill go along with you if I wont
be in the way

Thankful looked down rather doubtfully at the borrowed gown she was
wearing but Miss Parker came to the rescue by announcing that her
guests own garments must be dry by this time they had been hanging by
the stove all night So after the change had been made the two left
the Parker residence and took the footpath at the top of the bluff
Captain Obed seemed at first rather uneasy

Hope I aint hurryin you too much he said I thought maybe it would
be just as well to get out of sight of Hannah as quick as possible She
might take a notion to come with us I thought sure Kenelm would but
hes gone on a cruise of his own somewheres He hustled outdoor soon as
breakfast was over

Emily burst out laughing Excuse me please she said but Ive
been dying to do this for so long Thatthat Miss Parker is the oddest
person

The captain grinned Thinkin about that diagram yarn he asked
Tis funny when you hear it the first four or five times Hannah Parker
can get more wrong words in the right places than anybody I ever run
across She must have swallowed a dictionary some time or nother but
it aint digested well Im afraid

Thankful laughed too You must find her pretty amusin Capn Bangs
she said

The captain shook his head Shes a reglar dime show he observed
Then he added Only trouble with that kind of a show is it gets kind of
tiresome when you have to set through it all winter There now you can
see your property Mrs Barnes and ten mile either side of it Looks
some more lifelike and cheerful than it did last night dont it

It most assuredly did They had reached the summit of a little hill
and before and behind and beneath them was a view of shore and sea that
caused Emily to utter an exclamation of delight

Oh she cried WHAT a view What a wonderful view

Behind them beyond the knoll upon which stood the little Parker house
which they had just left at the further side of the stretch of salt
meadow with the creek and bridge was East Wellmouth village Along the
white sand of the beach now garlanded with lines of fresh seaweed
torn up and washed ashore by the gale were scattered a half dozen
fishhouses with dories and lobster pots before them and at the rear
of these began the gray and white huddle of houses and stores with two
white church spires and the belfry of the schoolhouse rising above their
roofs

At their right only a few yards from the footpath where they stood
the high sand bluff broke sharply down to the beach and the sea
The great waves tossing their white plumes on high came marching
majestically in to trip topple and fall one after the other in
roaring hissing Niagaras upon the shore Over their raveled crests
the gulls dipped and soared The air was clear the breeze keen and
refreshing and the salty smell of the torn seaweed rose to the nostrils
of the watchers

To the left were barren hills dotted with scrub and farther on the
pine groves with the road from Wellmouth Centre winding out from their
midst

All these things Thankful and Emily noticed but it was on the prospect
directly ahead that their interest centered For there upon the slope
of the next knoll stood the property they had come to see and to which
they had been introduced in such an odd fashion

Seen by daylight and in the glorious sunshine the old Barnes house
did look as their guide said more lifelike and cheerful A big
rambling graygabled affair of colonial pattern a large yard before
it and a larger one behind the tumbledown shed in which General
Jackson had been tethered a large barn also rather tumbledown
with henhouses and corncribs beside it and attached to it in haphazard
fashion In the front yard were overgrown clusters of lilac and rose
bushes and behind the barn was the stubble of a departed garden
Thankful looked at all these

So thats it she said

Thats it said Captain Obed What do you think of it

Humph Well theres enough of it anyhow as the little boy said about
the spring medicine What do you think Emily

Emilys answer was prompt and emphatic

I like it she declared It looks so different this morning Last
night it seemed lonesome and pokey and horrid but now it is almost
inviting Think what it must be in the spring and summer Think of
opening those upper windows on a summer morning and looking out and away
for miles and miles It would be splendid

Umyes But spring and summer dont last all the time Theres
December and January and February to think of Even March aint all joy
weve got last night to prove it by However it doesnt look quite so
desperate as I thought it might Ill give in to that Last night I
was about ready to sell it for the price of a return ticket to South
Middleboro Now I guess likely I ought to get a few tradin stamps along
with the ticket Humph This sartin isnt ALL Poverty Lane is it THAT
place want built with tradin stamps Who lives there

She was pointing to the estate adjoining the Barnes house and fronting
the sea further on Estate is a much abused term and is sometimes
applied to rather insignificant holdings but this one deserved the
name Great stretches of lawns and shrubbery ornamental windmill
greenhouses stables drives and a towered and turreted mansion
dominating all

I seem to have aristocratic neighbors anyhow observed Mrs Barnes
Whose tintype belongs in THAT gilt frame

Captain Obed chuckled at the question

Why nobodys just now he said There was one up to last fall
though I shouldnt have called him a tintype More of a panorama if
you asked meor him either That place belonged to our leadin summer
resident Mr Hamilton Colfax of New York Theres a good view from
there too but not as fine as this one of yours Mrs Barnes When your
uncle Capn Abner bought this old house it used to set over on a part
of that land there The capn didnt like the outlook so well as the one
from here so he bought this strip and moved the house down Quite a job
movin a house as old as this one

Mr Colfax died last October he added and the place is for sale
Good deal of a shock his death was to East Wellmouth Kind of like
takin away the doughnut and leavin nothin but the hole The Wellmouth
Weekly Advocate pretty nigh gave up the ghost when Mr Colfax did It
always callated on fillin at least three columns with the doins of
the Colfaxes and their house parties and such All summer it told
what they did do and all winter it guessed what they was goin to do It
aint been much more than a patent medicine advertisin circular since
the blow struck Well have you looked enough Shall we heave ahead and
go aboard your craft Mrs Barnes

They walked on down the little hill and up the next and entered the
front yard of the Barnes house There were the marks in the mud and sand
where the depotwagon had overturned but the wagon itself was gone
Callate Winnie S and his dad come around early and towed it home
surmised Captain Obed Seemed to me I smelled sulphur when I opened my
bedroom window this mornin Guess twas a sort of floatin memory of
old man Holts remarks when he went by That depotwagon was an antique
and antiques are valuable these days Want to go inside do you

Thankful hesitated I havent got the key she said I suppose its
at that Badger mans in the village You know who I mean Capn Bangs

The captain nodded

Christopher S H Badger tinware groceries real estate boots and
shoes and insurance he said Likewise justice of the peace and first
mate of all creation Yes I know Chris

Well hes been in charge of this property of mine He collected the
rent from that Mr Eldredge who used to live here I had a good many
letters from him mainly about paintin and repairs

Umhum I aint surprised Chris sells paint as well as tea and
tinware Hes got the key has he

I suppose he has I ought to have gone up and got it from him

Well I wouldnt fret about it Of course we cant go in the front
door like the minister and weddin company but the kitchen door was
unfastened last night and I presume likely its that way now You
havent any objection to the kitchen door have you When old Laban
lived here its a safe bet he never used any other Curous old critter
he was

They entered by the kitchen door The inside of the house like the
outside was transformed by day and sunshine The rooms downstairs were
large and well lighted and in spite of their emptiness they seemed
almost cheerful

Whose furniture is this asked Thankful referring to the stove and
chair and sofa in the diningroom

Labans that is it used to be When he died he didnt have chick nor
child nor relation so furs anybody knew and his stuff stayed right
here There want very much of it That is He hesitated

But there must have been more than this said Thankful What became
of it

Captain Obed shook his head You might ask Chris Badger he suggested
Chris sells antiques on the sidethe high side

Did old Mr Eldredge live here ALL alone asked Emily

Yup And died all alone too Course I dont mean he was alone all the
time he was sick Most of that time he was out of his head and folks
could stay with him but he came to himself occasional and when he did
hed fire em out because feedin em cost money He want what youd
call generous Laban want

Where did he die asked Thankful who was looking out of the window

Upstairs in the little back bedroom Smallest room in the house tis
and folks used to say he slept there cause he could heat it by his
cussin instead of a stove Most always cussin he wascussin and
groanin

Thankful was silent Emily said Groaning You mean he groaned when he
was ill

Yes and when he was well too A habit of his groanin was I dont
know why he done itsee himself in the lookinglass maybe that was
enough to make anybody groan Hed groan in his sleepor snoreor
both He was the noisiest sleeper ever I set up with Shall we go
upstairs

The narrow front stairs creaked as loudly in the daytime as they had
on the previous night but the long hall on the upper floor was neither
dark nor terrifying Nevertheless it was with just a suspicion of dread
that Mrs Barnes approached the large room at the end of the hall and
the small one adjoining it Her commonsense had returned and she
was naturally brave but an experience such as hers had been is not
forgotten in a few hours However she was determined that no one should
know her feelings therefore she was the first to enter the little room

Heres where Laban bunked said the captain Youd think with all
the big comftable bedrooms to choose from he wouldnt pick out this
twobyfour would you But he did probably because nobody else would
He was a contrary old rooster and odd as Dicks hatband

Thankful was listening although not to their guides remarks She was
listening for sounds such as she had heardor thought she had heardon
the occasion of her previous visit to that room But there were no such
sounds There was the bed the patchwork comforter the chair and the
pictures on the walls but when she approached that bed there came
no disturbing groans And by day the memory of her fright seemed
absolutely ridiculous For at least the tenth time she solemnly resolved
that no one should ever know how foolish she had been

Emily uttered an exclamation and pointed

Why Auntie she cried Isnt thatwhere did that lantern come
from

Captain Obed looked where she was pointing He stepped forward and
picked up the overturned lantern

Thats Darius Holts lantern I do believe he declared The one
Winnie S was makin such a fuss about last night How in the nation did
it get up here

Thankful laughed I brought it up she said I come on a little
explorin cruise when Emily dropped asleep on that sittinroom lounge
but I hadnt much moren got in here when the pesky thing went out You
ought to have seen me hurryin along that hall to get down before
you woke up Emily No come to think of it you couldnt have seen
metwas too dark to see anything    Well she added quickly
in order to head off troublesome questioning weve looked around here
pretty well What else is there to see

They visited the garret and the cellar both were spacious and not too
clean

If I ever come here to live declared Thankful with decision
therell be some dustin and sweepin done I know that

Emily looked at her in surprise

Come here to live she repeated Why Auntie are you thinking of
coming here to live

Her cousins answer was not very satisfactory Ive been thinkin a
good many things lately she said Some of em was even more crazy
than that sounds

The inside of the house having been thus thoroughly inspected they
explored the yard and the outbuildings The barn was a large one with
stalls for two horses and a cow and a carriageroom with the remnants of
an oldfashioned carryall in it

This is about the way it used to be in Capn Abners day said Captain
Obed That carryall belonged to your uncle the capn Mrs Barnes
The boys have had it out for two or three Fourth of July Antiques and
Horribles parades twont last for many more by the looks of it

And what asked Thankful is that It looks like a pigsty

They were standing at the rear of the house which was built upon a
slope Under the washshed which adjoined the kitchen was a rickety
door Beside that door was a boarded enclosure which extended both into
the yard and beneath the washshed

Captain Bangs laughed Youve guessed it first crack he said It
is a pigpen Some of Labans doins that is He used to keep a pig and
twas too much trouble to travel way out back of the barn to feed it so
Labe rigged up this contraption That door leads into the potato cellar
Labe fenced off half the cellar to make a stateroom for the pig He
thought as much of that hog as if twas his own brother and there WAS a
sort of family likeness

Thankful snorted A pigsty under the house she said Well thats
all I want to know about THAT man

As they were returning along the footpath by the bluff Captain Obed
who had been looking over his shoulder suddenly stopped

Thats kind of funny he said

What asked Emily

Oh nothin I guess I thought I caught a sight of somebody peekin
around the back of that henhouse If twas somebody he dodged back so
quick I couldnt be sure Humph I guess I was mistaken or twas just
one of Solon Taylors young ones Solons a sort ofsort of stevedore
at the Colfax place Lives there and takes care of it while the owners
are away Noo no I dont see nobody now

Thankful was silent during the homeward walk When she and Miss Howes
were alone in their room she said

Emily are you real set on gettin back to South Middleboro tonight

No Auntie Why

Well if you aint I think Id like to stay over another day Ive got
an idea in my head and such a thing bein kind of unusual Id like
to keep company with it for a spell Ill tell you about it by and by
probably twont come to anything anyway

But do you think we ought to stay here as Miss Parkers guests
Wouldnt it be

Of course it would Well go over to that hotel the one we started
for in the first place Judgin from what I hear of that tavern itll be
wuth experiencin andand somethin may come of that too

She would not explain further and Emily knowing her well did not
press the point

Hannah Parker protested volubly when her company declared its
intention of going to the East Wellmouth Hotel

Of course you shant do no such thing she declared The idea Its
no trouble at all to have you and that hotel really aint fit for such
folks as you to stay at Mrs Bacon from Boston stayed there one night
in November and she pretty nigh famished with the cold to say nothin
of havin to eat huckleberry preserves for supper two nights runnin
Course they had plenty of other things in the closet but theyd opened
a jar of huckleberries so they had to be et up afore they spiled
Thats the way they run THAT hotel And Mrs Bacon is eastern
Massachusetts delegate from the State Grange Shes Grand Excited
Matron Just think of treatin her that way Well whereve you been all
the forenoon

The question was addressed to her brother who entered the house by the
side door at that moment Kenelm seemed a trifle confused

II been lookin for that umbrella Hannah he explained I knew I
must have left it somewheres causecause you see II took it out
with me last night andand

And come home without it It wouldnt take a King Solomon to know that
Did you find it

Kenelms embarrassment appeared to increase

Well he stammered I aint exactly found itbut

But what

IIm callatin to find it Hannah

Yes I know Youre callatin to get to Heaven some time or other
I spose but if the path is as narrow and crooked as they say tis I
should be scared if I was you Youll find a way to lose it if there is
one Oh dear me with a sudden change to a tone almost pleading Be
you goin to smoke again

Kenelms reply was strange for him He scratched a match and lit his
pipe with calm deliberation

Im callatin to he said cheerfully And his sister to the
surprise of Mrs Barnes and Emily did not utter another word of
protest

Captain Obed volunteered to accompany them to the hotel and to the
store of Mr Badger On the way Thankful mentioned Mr Parkers amazing
independence in the matter of the pipe

The captain chuckled Yes he said Kenelm smokes when he wants to
and sometimes when he dont I guess just to keep his selfrespect
Smokin is one pint where he beat out Hannah Its quite a yarn the
way he done it is Some time Ill tell it to you maybe

The hotelit was kept by Darius Holt father of Winnie Swas no more
inviting than Miss Parkers and Captain Bangs hints had led them to
expect But Thankful insisted on engaging a room for the night and on
returning there for dinner supper and breakfast the following day

After that well see she said Now lets go and make a call on that
rent collector of mine

Mr Badger was surprised to meet the owner of the Barnes house
surprised and a bit taken aback so it seemed to Mrs Barnes and her
cousin He was very polite almost obsequiously so and his explanations
concerning the repairs which he had found it necessary to make and the
painting which he had had done were lengthy if not convincing

As they left him smiling and bowing in the doorway of his store
Thankful shook her head When they were out of earshot she said

Hum The paint he says he put on that precious property of mine dont
show as much as youd expect but he used enough butter and whitewash
this morning to make up Hes a slick party that Mr Badger is or
I miss my guess His business arithmetic dont go much further than
addition Everything in creation added to one makes one and hes the
one Mr Chris Badgers got jobs enough accordin to his sign He wont
starve if he dont collect rents for me any more

The hotel dinner was neither bountiful nor particularly well cooked
The Holts joined them at table and Winnie S talked a good deal He
expressed much joy at the recovery of his lantern

But when I see you folks in that house last night he said I thought
to myself Judas priest thinks I Them women has got more spunk than
Ive got Gettin into a house like that all alone in the darkWhew
Judas priest I wouldnt do it

Why not asked Emily

Oh just cause I wouldnt I suppose Now I dont believe in such
things of course but old Laban he did die there I never heard
nothin but they tell me

Rubbish broke in Mr Holt Senior Taint nothin but fool yarns
the whole of it Take an old house a hundred year old same as that is
and shut her up and taint long afore folks do get to pretendin they
hear things I never heard nothin Have some more pie Miss Howes Huh
There AINT no more is there

After dinner Emily retired to her room for a nap She did so under
protest declaring that she was not tired but Thankful insisted

If you aint tired now you will be when the excitements over she
said My conscience is plaguin me enough about fetchin you on this
cruise as it is Just take it as easy as you can Emily Lie down and
rest and please me

So Emily obeyed orders and Mrs Barnes after drawing the curtains and
asking over and over again if her cousin was sure she was comfortable
went out It was late in the afternoon when she returned

Ive been talkin until my face aches she declared And my mind is
about made up to doto do what may turn out to be the craziest thing
I ever DID do Ill tell you the whole thing after supper Emily Lets
let my tongue have a vacation till then

And after supper which by the way was no better than the dinner she
fulfilled her promise They retired to the bedroom and Thankful having
carefully closed the windows and door and hung a towel over the keyhole
told of her halfformed plan

Emily she began I presume likely youll feel that youd ought to go
back home tomorrow Yes I knew youd feel that way Well I aint goin
with you Ive made up my mind to stay here for a few days longer Now
Ill tell you why

You see Emily she went on my comin down here to East Wellmouth
want altogether for the fun of lookin at the heirloom Uncle Abner
left me The first thing I wanted to do was see it but when I had
seen it and if it turned out to be what I hoped it might be there was
somethin else Emily Mrs Pearsons dyin leaves me without a job Oh
of course I know I could most likely get another chance at nursin or
keepin house for somebody but to tell you the truth Im gettin
kind of tired of that sort of thing Other folks houses are like other
folks ailments they dont interest you as much as your own do Im
sick of askin somebody else what they want for dinner Id like to get
my own dinner or at least if somebody else is to eat with me I want
to decide myself what theyll have to eat I want to run my own house
once more afore I die And it seemsyes it seems to me as if here was
the chance nothin but a chance and a risky one but a chance just the
same Emily Im thinkin of fixin up Uncle Abners old rattletrap and
openin a boardinhouse for summer folks in it

Yes yes I know she continued noticing the expression on her
companions face Theres as much objection to the plan as there is
slack managin in this hotel and thats some considerble Fust off
itll cost money Well Ive saved a little money and those cranberry
bog shares Mrs Pearson left me will sell for two thousand at least
That would be enough maybe if I wanted to risk it all but I dont
Ive got another scheme This property of mine down here is free and
clear but on account of its location and the view Capn Bangs tells
me its worth considerble more than I thought it was I believeyes I
do believe I could put a mortgage on it for enough to pay for the fixin
over maybe more

Emily interrupted

But Auntie she said a mortgage is a debt isnt it A debt that
must be paid And if you borrow from a stranger

Just a minute Emily Course a mortgage is a debt but its a debt on
the house and land and if worse comes to worst the house and land can
go to pay for it And I dont mean to borrow from a stranger if I can
help it Ive got a relation down here on the Cape although hes a
pretty furoff roundthecorner relation third cousin or somethin
like that His names Solomon Cobb and he lives over to Trumet about
nine mile from here so Capn Bangs says And he and Uncle Abner used
to sail together for years He was mate aboard the schooner when
Uncle Abner died on a vyage from Charleston home This Cobb man is a
tightfisted old bachelor they say but his milk of human kindness may
not be all skimmed And anyhow he does take mortgages thats the heft
of his businessI got that from the capn without tellin him what I
wanted to know for

Miss Howes smiled

You and Captain Bangs have been putting your heads together I see
she said

Umhm And his head aint all mush and seeds like a pumpkin if Im
any judge The capn tells me that east Wellmouth needs a good summer
boardinhouse Thisthis contraption were in now is the nighest thing
there is to it and thats as far off as dirt is from soap you can see
that yourself Cordin to Capn Bangs lots and lots of city people
would come here summers if there was a respectable decent place to go
to Now Emily why cant I give em such a place Seems to me I can
Anyhow if I can mortgage the place to Cousin Sol Cobb I thinkyes Im
pretty sure I shall try Now what do you think Is your Aunt Thankful
Barnes losin her sensealways providin shes ever had any to loseor
is she gettin to be a real business woman at last

Emilys reply was at first rather doubtful She raised one objection
after the other but Mrs Barnes was always ready with an answer It was
plain that she had looked at her plan from every angle And at last
Miss Howes too became almost enthusiastic

I do believe she said it may turn out to be a splendid thing for
you Auntie At least Im sure you will succeed if anyone can Oh
dear wistfully I only wish it were possible for me to stay here and
help with it all But I cantI cant Mother and the children need the
money and I must go back to my school

Thankful nodded Yes she admitted I suppose likely you must for
the present Butbut if it SHOULD be a go and I SHOULD see plainer
sailin ahead then Id need somebody to help manage somebody younger
and more uptodate than I am And I know mighty well who I shall send
for

They talked for a long time but at last after they were in bed and the
lamp was extinguished Emily said

I hate to go back and leave you here Auntie indeed I do I shall
be so interested and excited I shall scarcely be able to wait for your
letters You will write just as soon as you have seen this Mr Cobb
wont you

Yes sartin sure I will I know its goin to be hard for you to go and
leave me Emily but I shant be havin a Sundayschool picnic exactly
myself From what I used to hear about Cousin Solomon unless hes
changed a whole lot since gettin a dollar from him wont be as easy
as pullin a spoon out of a kittle of softsoap Ill have to do some
persuadin I guess Wish my tongue was as soothinsyrupy as that Mr
Badgers is But Im goin to do my best And if talkin wont do it
IllI swear I dont know as I shant give him ether Maybe hed take
THAT if he could get it for nothin Good night




CHAPTER V


Well said Thankful with a sigh shes gone anyhow I feel almost
as if Id cut my anchor rope and was driftin out of sight of land Its
queer aint it how you can make up your mind to do a thing and
then when youve really started to do it almost wish you hadnt Last
nightyes and this morninI was as set on carryin through this plan
of mine as a body could be but just now when I saw Emily get aboard
those cars it was all I could do to keep from goin along with her

Captain Obed nodded Sartin he agreed Thats natural enough When I
was a youngster I was forever teasin to go to sea I thought my dad was
meaner than a spiled herrin to keep on sayin no when I said yes But
when he did say yes and I climbed aboard the stagecoach to start for
Boston where my ship was I never was more homesick in my life I was
later on thoughhomesick and other kinds

They were standing on the station platform at Wellmouth Centre and
the train which was taking Emily back to South Middleboro was a rapidly
moving smoking blur in the distance The captain who seemed to
have taken a decided fancy to his prospective neighbor and her young
relative had come with them to the station Thankful had hired a horse
and open wagon at the livery stable in East Wellmouth and had intended
engaging a driver as well but Captain Bangs had volunteered to act in
that capacity

I havent got much to do this mornin he said Fact is I generally
do have more time on my hands than anything else this season of the
year Later on when I put out my fish weirs Im pretty busy but now
Im a sort of longshore loafer Youre figurin to go to Trumet after
youve seen Miss Emily leave the dock you said didnt you Well Ive
got an errand of my own in Trumet that might as well be done now as any
time Ill drive you over and back if youre willin to trust the vessel
in my hands I dont set up to be head of the Pilots Association
when it comes to steerin a horse but I callate I can handle any
fourlegged craft youre liable to charter in East Wellmouth

His offer was accepted and so far he had proved a competent and able
helmsman Now Miss Howes having been started on her homeward way the
next port of call was to be the office of Mr Solomon Cobb at Trumet

During the first part of the drive Thankful was silent and answered
only when spoken to The parting with Emily and the sense of heavy
responsibility entailed by the project she had in mind made her rather
solemn and downcast Captain Obed noticing this and suspecting the
cause chatted and laughed and after a time his passenger seemed to
forget her troubles and to enjoy the trip

They jogged up the main street of Trumet until they reached the little
threecornered square which is the business center of the village
Next beyond the barbershop which is two doors beyond the general store
and postoffice was a little onestory building weatherbeaten and
badly in need of paint The captain steered his craft up to the
sidewalk before this building and pulled up

Whoa he ordered addressing the horse Then turning to Thankful he
said

Here you are maam This is Sol Cobbs place

Mrs Barnes looked at the little building Its exterior certainly was
not inviting The windows looked as if they had not been washed for
weeks the window shades were yellow and crooked and one of the panes
of glass in the front door was cracked across Thankful had not seen her
Cousin Solomon for years not since she was a young woman but she had
heard stories of his numerous investments and business prosperity and
she could scarcely believe this dingy establishment was his

Are you sure Capn Bangs she faltered This cant be the Solomon
Cobb I mean Hes well off and it dont seem as if he would be in an
office like thisif tis an office she added It looks more like a
henhouse to me And theres no signs anywhere

The captain laughed Signs cost money he said It takes paint to
make a sign same as it does to keep a henhouse lookin respectable
This is the only Sol Cobb in Trumet furs I ever heard and hes well
off sartin He ought to be I never heard of him lettin go of anything
he got hold of Maybe you think Im talkin pretty free about your
relation Mrs Barnes he added apologetically I hadnt ought to I
suppose but Ive had one or two little dealins with Sol one time or
nother and Iwell maybe Im prejudiced Excuse me wont you He may
be altogether different with his own folks

Thankful was still staring at the dubious and forbidding front door

It doesnt seem as if it could be she said But if you say so of
course tis

Yes maam I guess tis Thats Sol Cobbs henhouse and the old
rooster is in judgin by the signs Those are his rubbers on the step
Wearin rubbers winter or summer is a habit of his Humph Im talkin
too much again Youre goin in I suppose maam

Thankful threw aside the carriage robe and prepared to clamber from the
wagon

I surely am she declared Thats what I came way over here for

The captain sprang to the ground and helped her to alight

Ill be right across the road at the store there he said Ill be on
the watch when you came out II

He hesitated Evidently there was something else he wished to say but
he found the saying difficult Thankful noticed the hesitation

Yes what was it Capn Bangs she asked

Captain Obed fidgeted with the reins

Why nothin I guess he faltered Onlyonlywell I tell you
Mrs Barnes ifif you was figgerin on doin any business with Mr
Cobb any money business I mean andand youd rather go anywheres
else IIwell Im pretty well acquainted round here on the Cape
amongst the bank folks and such and Id be real glad to

Thankful interrupted She had after much misgiving and reluctance
made up her mind to approach her distant relative with the mortgage
proposition but to discuss that proposition with strangers was to her
mind very different She had mentioned the proposed mortgage to Emily
but she had told no one else not even the captain himself And she did
not mean to tell The boarding house plan must stand or fall according
to Mr Cobbs reception of it

No no she said hastily It aint anything importantthat is very
important

Well all right You seeI only meantexcuse me Mrs Barnes I hope
you dont think I meant to be nosey or interferin in your affairs

Of course I dont Youve gone to a lot of trouble on my account as
tis and youve been real kind

The captain hurriedly muttered that he hadnt been kind at all and
watched her as she walked up the short path to Mr Cobbs front door
Then with a solemn shake of the head he clinched again at the wagon
seat and drove across the road to the hitchingposts before the store
Thankful opened the door of the henhouse and entered

The interior of the little building was no mare inviting than its
outside One room dark with a bare floor and with cracked plastered
walls upon which a few calendars and an ancient map were hanging There
was a worn wooden settee and two wooden armchairs at the front near the
stove and at the rear an oldfashioned walnut desk

At this desk in a shabby leathercushioned armchair sat a little old
man with scant gray hair and a fringe of gray throat whiskers He wore
steelrimmed spectacles and over these he peered at his visitor

Good mornin said Thankful It seemed to her high time that someone
said something and the little man had not opened his lips He did not
open them even now

Um he grunted and that was all

Are you Mr Solomon Cobb she asked She knew now that he was he had
changed a great deal since she had last seen him but his eyes had not
changed and he still had the habit she remembered that of pulling at
his whiskers in little short tugs as if trying to pull them out Like
a man hauling wild carrots out of a turnip patch she wrote Emily when
describing the interview

He did not answer the question Instead after another long look he
said

If youre sellin books I dont want none Dont use em

This was so entirely unexpected that Mrs Barnes was for the moment
confused and taken aback

Books she repeated wonderingly I didnt say anything about books
I asked you if you was Mr Cobb

Another look If youre sellin or peddlin or agentin or anything I
dont want none said the little man Im tellin you now sos you can
save your breath and mine Ive got all I want

Thankful looked at him and his surroundings This ungracious and
unlooked for reception began to have its effect upon her temper as she
wrote Emily in the letter her back fin began to rise It was on the
tip of her tongue to say that judging by appearances he should want a
good many things politeness among others But she did not say it

I aint a peddler or a book agent she declared crisply When I
ask you to buy seems to me twould be time enough to say no If youre
Solomon Cobb and I know you are Ive come to see you on business

The word business had an effect Mr Cobb swung about in his chair and
regarded her fixedly There was a slight change in his tone

Business hey he repeated Well Im a business man maam What
sort of business is it youve got

Thankful did not answer the question immediately Instead she walked
nearer to the desk

Yes she said slowly youre Solomon Cobb I should know you
anywhere now And I aint seen you for twenty year I presume likely you
dont know me

The man of business stared harder than ever He took off his spectacles
rubbed them with his handkerchief put them on and stared again

No maam I dont he said You dont live in Trumet I know that
You aint seen me for twenty year eh Twenty year is quite a spell And
yet theres somethin sort ofsort of familiar about you now that I
look closer Who be you

My name is Thankful Barnesnow It didnt used to be When you knew
me twas Thankful Cahoon My grandmother on my fathers side was your
mothers own cousin Her name was Matilda Myrick That makes you and me
sort of distant relations Mr Cobb

If she expected this statement to have the effect of making the little
man more cordial she was disappointed In fact if it had any effect at
all it was the opposite judging by his manner and expression His only
comments on the disclosure of kinship were a Humph and a brief Want
to know He stared at Thankful and she at him Then he said

Well

Mrs Barnes was astonished

Well she repeated Whats well What do you mean by that

Nothins I know of You said you came to see me about some business or
other What sort of business

I came to see you about gettin some money I need some money just now
and

Solomon interrupted her

Humph he grunted I callated as much

You callated it For the land sakeswhy

Because you begun by sayin you was a relation of mine Ive got a good
many relations floatin around loose and there aint nary one of em
ever come to see me unless twas to get money If I give money to all my
relations that asked for it Id be a dum sight poorern I be now

Thankful was by this time thoroughly angry

Look here she snapped If Id come to you expectin you to GIVE me
any money Id be an idiot as well as a relation Fars that last part
goes I aint any prouder of it than you are

This pointed remark had no more effect than the statement of
relationship Mr Cobb was quite unruffled

You came to see me he said and you aint come afore for twenty
yearyou said so Now when you do come you want money you said that
too

Well what of it

Nothin of it special Only when a party comes to me and commences
by sayin he or shes a relation I know whats comin next Relations
Humph My relations never done much for me

Thankfuls fingers twitched Cordin to all accounts you never done
much for them either she declared You dont even ask em to sit
down Well you neednt worry so fars Im concerned Goodby

She was on her way out of the office but he called her back

Hi hold on he called You aint told me what that business was yet
Come back Youyou can set down if you want to

Thankful hesitated She was strongly tempted to go and never return
And yet if she did she must go elsewhere to obtain the mortgage she
wished And to whom should she go Reluctantly she retraced her steps

Set down said Mr Cobb pulling forward a chair Now what is it you
want

Mrs Barnes sat down Ill tell you what I dont want she said with
emphasis I dont want you to give me any money or to lend me any
eitherwithout its bein a plain business deal I aint askin charity
of you or anybody else Solomon Cobb And youd better understand that
if you and I are goin to talk any more

Mr Cobb tugged at his whiskers

Youve got a temper aint you he declared Tempers a good thing
to play with maybe if you can afford it I aint rich enough myself
Ive saved a good many dollars by keepin mine If you dont want me to
give you nor lend you money what do you want

I want you to take a mortgage on some property I own You do take
mortgages dont you

More whisker pulling Solomon nodded

I do sometimes he admitted when I callate theyre safe to take
Where is this property of yours

Over in East Wellmouth Its the old Abner Barnes place Capn Abner
willed it to me He was my uncle

And at last Mr Cobb showed marked interest Slowly he leaned back in
his chair His spectacles fell from his nose into his lap and lay there
unheeded

What Whats that you say he asked sharply Abner Barnes was your
uncle II thought you said your name was Cahoon

I said it used to be afore I was married when I knew you Afterwards
I married Eben Barnes Capn Abners nephew That made the captain my
uncle by marriage

Solomons fingers groped for his spectacles He picked them up and took
his handkerchief from his pocket But it was his forehead he rubbed with
his handkerchief not the glasses

Youreyoure Abner Barnes niece he said slowly

Yesniece by marriage

The one he used to talk so much about What was her
namePatienceTemprance

Thankfulthats my name I presume likely Uncle Abner did use to talk
about me He always declared he thought as much of me as if I was his
own child

There was an interval of silence Mr Cobb replaced his spectacles and
stared through them at his visitor His manner was peculiarmarkedly
so

I went mate for Capn Abner a good many vyages he said after a
moment

Yes I know you did

Hehe told you so I suppose

Yes

What else did he tell you aboutabout me I mean

Why nothin special that I know of Why What was there to tell

Nothin Nothin much I guess Abner and me was sort ofsort of
chums and I didnt know but he might have saidmight have told you
considerable about me He didnt hey

No He told me you was his mate thats all

It may have been Thankfuls imagination but it did seem as if her
relative was a trifle relieved But even yet he did not seem quite
satisfied He pulled at his whiskers and asked another question

What made you come here to me he asked

Mercy on us Ive told you that havent I I came to see about gettin
a mortgage on his old place over to East Wellmouth I knew you took
mortgagesat least folks said you didand bein as you was a relation
I thought

A wave of the hand interrupted her

Yes yes broke in Solomon hastily I know that Was that the only
reason

I presume likely twas I did think it was a natural one and reason
enough but I guess THAT was a mistake It looks as if twas

She made a move to rise but he leaned forward and detained her

There there he said Set still set still So youre Abner Barnes
niece

My soul Ive told you so three times

Abners niece I want to know

Well I should think you might know by this time Now about that
mortgage

Hey Oh yesyes You want a mortgage on Abners place over to East
Wellmouth Um Well I know the property and about what its wuthwhich
aint much What are you callatin to dolive there

Yes if I can carry out the plan Ive got in my head Im thinkin of
fixin up that old place and livin in it Im figgerin to run it as
a boardinhouse Itll cost money to put it in shape and a mortgage is
the simplest way of raisin that money I suppose Thats the long and
short of it

The dealer in mortgages appeared to hear and there was no reason why
he should not have understood But he seemed still unsatisfied even
suspicious The whiskers received another series of pulls and he
regarded Thankful with the same questioning stare

And you say he drawled that you come to me just because

Mercy on us If you dont know why I come by this time then

All right all right IIm talkin to myself I guess Course you
told me why you come So youre callatin to start a boardinhouse
eh Risky things boardinhouses are Theres a couple of hundred
launched every year and not moren ten ever make a payin vyage Lets
hear what your plan is the whole of it

Fighting down her impatience Thankful went into details concerning her
plan She explained why she had thought of it and her growing belief
that it might be successful Mr Cobb listened

Humph he grunted when she had finished So Obed Bangs advised you
to try it hey That dont make me think no better of it as I know of
I know Bangs pretty well

Yes dryly I supposed likely you did Anyhow he said he knew you

He did hey Told you some things about me hey

No he didnt tell me anything except that you and he had had some
dealins Now Mr Cobb weve talked a whole lot and it dont seem
to me we got anywheres If you dont want to take a mortgage on that
place

Sshh Who said I didnt want to take it How do I know what I want to
do yet Lord How you women do go on Suppose I should take a mortgage
on that placemind I dont say I will but suppose I shouldhow would
I know that the mortgage would be paid or the interest or anything

If it aint paid you can foreclose when the time comes I presume
likely As for the interestwell Im fairly honest or I try to be
and thatll be paid reglar if I live

Yaas Well furs honesty goes I could run a seine through Ostable
County any day in the week and load a schooner with honest folks and
there wouldnt nary one of em have cash enough to pay for the wear and
tear on the net Honestys good policy maybe but it takes hard money
to pay bills

Thankful stood up

All right she said decidedly then Ill go where they play the
honest game And you neednt set there and weed your face any more on my
account

Mr Cobb rose also There there he protested Dont get het up I
dont say I wont take your mortgage do I

Youve said a good deal If you say any more of the same kind you can
say it to yourself I tell you honest I dont like the way you say
it

The owner of the henhouse looked as if he wished very much to retort
in kind The glare he gave his visitor prophesied direful things But
he did not retort nor to her surprise did he raise his voice or order
her off the premises Instead his tone when he spoke again was quiet
even conciliatory

IIm sorry if Ive said anything I shouldnt he stammered Im
gettin old andand sort of short in my talk maybe IItheres
a good many folks round here that dont like me count of my doin
business in a business way stead of doin it like the average poor
fool I suppose theyve been talkin to you and youve got sort of
prejudiced Well I dont knows I blame you for that I shant hold
no grudge How much of a mortgage do you callate to want on Abners
place

Two thousand dollars

Two thousand    There there Hold on hold on Two thousand
dollars is a whole lot of money It dont grow on every bush

I know that as well as you do If I did Id have picked it afore this

Umhm How long a time do you want

I dont know Three years perhaps

Solomon shook his head

Too long he said I couldnt give as long a mortgage as that to
anybody No I couldnt do it    Tell you what I will do he added
II dont want to act mean to a relation I think as much of relations
as anybody does Id like to favor you and I will if I can You give me
a week to think this over in and then Ill let you know what Ill do
Thats fair aint it

Mrs Barnes declined the offer

It may be fair to you she said but I cant wait so long I want
to settle this afore I go back to South Middleboro And I shall go back
tomorrow or the day after at the latest

Another session of weeding Then said Mr Cobb Well all right all
right Ill think it over and then Ill drive across to East Wellmouth
have another look at the property and let you know Ill see you day
after tomorrow forenoon Where you stoppin over there

Thankful told him He walked as far as the door with her

Hope you aint put out with me maam he said I have to be kind of
sharp and straight up and down in my dealins theyd get the weather
gauge on me a dozen times a day if I want But Im real
kind insideto them I take a notion to IllIll treat you
rightererCousin Thankful you see if I dont Im real glad you
come to me Good day

Thankful went down the path As she reached the sidewalk she turned and
looked back The gentleman with the kind interior was standing peering
at her through the cracked glass of the door He was still tugging at
his whiskers and if as he had intimated he had taken a notion to
her his expression concealed the fact wonderfully

Captain Obed who had evidently been on the lookout for his passenger
appeared on the platform of the store on the other side of the road
After asking if she had any other port of call in that neighborhood
he assisted her into the carriage and they started on their homeward
trip The captain must have filled with curiosity concerning the widows
interview with Mr Cobb but beyond asking if she had seen the latter
he did not question Thankful appreciated his reticence the average
dweller in WellmouthWinnie S for instancewould have started in on
a vigorous crossexamination Her conviction that Captain Bangs was much
above the average was strengthened

Yes she said he was there I saw him Hes aa kind of queer
person I should say Do you know him real well Capn Bangs

The captain nodded Yes he said I know him about as well as anybody
outside of Trumet does I aint sure that anybody really knows him all
the way through Queer he chuckled Well yesyou might say Sol
Cobb was queer and you wouldnt be strainin the truth enough to start a
plank Hes all that and then considerble

What sort of a man is he

Sol Hum Well hes smart anybody that beats Sol Cobb in a trade has
got to get up a long ways ahead of breakfast time Might stay up all
night and then not have more leeway than hed be liable to need

Yes Yes Im sure hes smart in business But is heis he a GOOD
man

The captain hesitated before replying

Git dap he ordered addressing the horse Good Is Sol good Well
I callate that depends some on what dictionary you hunt up the word
in Hes pious sartin There aint many that report on deck at the
meetinhouse more reglar than he does He dont callate to miss a
prayermeetin and when theres a revival goin on hes right up front
with the mourners Folks do say that his favorite hymn is Im Glad
Salvations Free and they heave out considerble many hints that if
twant free he wouldnt have got it but then thats an old joke and
Ive heard em say the same thing about other people

But do you think hes honest

I never heard of his doin anything against the law Hell skin honesty
as close as he can there aint much hide left when he gets through but
I callate he thinks hes honest And maybe he ismaybe he is It all
depends on the definition same as I said Sols pious all right I
callate hed sue anybody that had a doubt as to how many days Josiah
went cabin passenger aboard the whale His notion of Heaven may be a
little mite hazy although hed probably lay considerble stress on
the golden streets but hes sot and definite about tother place
Yes siree he added reflectively Sol is sartin theres a mighty
uncomftable Tophet and that folks who dont believe just as he does
are bound there And he dont mean to go himself if tendin up to
meetin ll keep him clear

Its kind of queer to me he went on slowly to see the number
of folks that make up their minds to be goodor what they call
goodbecause theyre scared to be bad Doin right because right IS
right and lettin the Almighty credit em with that because Hes
generally supposed to know its right full well as they dothat aint
enough for their kind They have to keep hollerin out loud how good
they are so Hell hear and wont make any mistake in bookin their own
particular passage Sort of takin out a religious insurance policy you
might say twas    Humph he added coming out of his reverie and
looking doubtfully at his companion II hope I aint shocked you
maam I dont mean to be irreverent you understand Ive thought
considerble about such things and I have funny ideas maybe

Thankful declared that she was not shocked She had heard but little of
her drivers long dissertation She was thinking of her interview with
Mr Cobb and the probability of his accepting her proposal and taking a
mortgage on her East Wellmouth property If he refused what should
she do then And if he accepted and she went on to carry her plan into
execution what would be the outcome The responsibility was heavy She
would be risking all she had in the world If she succeeded well and
good If she failed she would be obliged to begin all over again to try
for another position as housekeeper perhaps to go out nursing once
more She was growing older soon she would be beyond middle life and
entering upon the first stages of old age And what a lonely old age
hers was likely to be Her husband was dead her only near relative
brother Jedediah waswell he might be dead also poor helpless
dreamy incompetent He might have died in the Klondike providing he
ever reached that faroff country which was unlikely He would have
been but an additional burden upon her had he lived and remained at
home but he would have been company for her at least Emily was a
comfort but she had little hope of Emilys being able to leave her
school or the family which her salary as teacher helped to support No
she must carry her project through alone all alone

She spoke but seldom and Captain Obed noticing the change in her manner
and possibly suspecting the cause did his best to divert her thoughts
and cheer her He chatted continuously like as he declared afterwards
a poll parrot with its bill greased He changed the topic from Mr
Cobb and his piety to the prospects of good fishing in the spring from
that to the failure of the previous falls cranberry crop and from
that again to Kenelm Parker and his sister Hannah And after a time
Thankful realized that he was telling a story




CHAPTER VI


Takin other folks advice about your own affairs began Capn Obed
is like a feller readin patent medicine circulars to find somethin
to cure a cold Afore he gets through his symptoms have developed into
bronchitis and pneumony with gallopin consumption dead ahead You
never can tell whatll happen

You noticed how Hannah Parker sort of riz up when Kenelm started
smokin yesterday Yes I know you did cause you spoke of it And you
notice too how meek and lowly she laid down and give in when he
kept right on doin it That aint her usual way with Kenelm by a
considerble sight I told you there was quite a yarn hitched to that
smokin business So there is

Kenelms an old bach you know One time he used to work or pretend
to because he needed the money but his Aunt Phoebe up to Brockton died
and left him four or five thousand dollars and he aint worked of any
account since Hes a gentleman now livin on his incomeand his
sister

Hannah aint got but precious little money of her own but she knows
how to take care of it which her brother dont She was housekeepin
for some folks at Wapatomac but when the inheritances landed she headed
straight for East Wellmouth rented that little house theyre in now
and took charge of Kenelm He want overanxious to have her do it but
that didnt make any difference One of her pet bugaboos was that now
her brother was welloffcordin to her idea of welloffnesssome
designin woman or other would marry him for his money Down she
come first train and shes been all hands and the cook yes and
paymasterwith Kenelm a sort of steerage passenger ever since She
keeps watch over him same as the sewin circle does over the ministers
wife and its No Anchorage for Females around that house I can tell
you

Another of her special despisinsnext to old maids and young
widowsused to be tobacco smoke We had a revival preacher in East
Wellmouth that first winter and he stirred up things like a stick in a
mudhole He was young and kind of goodlookin with a voice like the
Skakit foghorn and he took the sins of the world in his mouth one
after the other as you might say and shook em sames a pup would a
Sunday bunnit He laid into rum and rum sellin and folks fairly got in
line to sign the pledge Twas Come early and avoid the rush Got so
that Chris Badger hardly dast to use alcohol in his cigarlighter

Then havin dried us up that revival feller begun to smoke us out He
preached six sermons on the evils of tobacco and every one was hottern
the last Accordin to him if you smoked now youd burn later on Lots
of the men folks threw their pipes away and took to chewin slippry
ellum

Now Kenelm smoked like a peat fire He lit up after breakfast and
puffed steadily until bedtime only puttin his pipe down to eat or to
rummage in his pocket for more tobacco Hannah got him to go to one of
the antitobacco meetins He set through the whole of it interested as
could be Then when twas over he stopped in the church entry to
load up his pipe and walked home with his sister blowin rings and
scratchin matches and talkin loud about how fine the sermon was
He talked all next day about that sermon said hed go every night if
theyd let you smoke in there

So Hannah was set back a couple of rows but she want
discouragednot by a forty fathom She got after her brother mornin
noon and night about the smokin habit The most provokin part of it
so she said was that he always agreed with her

Its ruinin your health shed say

Yes says Kenelm lookin solemn I callate thats so Ive been
feelin poorly for over a year now Worries me considerble Pass me
that plug on the top of the clock wont you Hannah

Now what can you do with a feller like that

She couldnt start him with fussin about HIS health so she swung over
on a new tack and tried her own She said so much smoke in the house
was drivin her into consumption and she worked up a cough that was
a reglar graveyard quickstep I heard her practicin it once and I
swan there was harps and halos all through it

That cough made Kenelm set up and take notice and no wonder He
listened to a hundred or so of Hannahs earthquakes and then he got up
and pranced out of the house When he came back the doctor was with him

Now this want exactly what his sister was lookin for She didnt
want to see the doctor But Kenelm said shed got to have her lungs
sounded right off and he guessed theyd have to use a deepsea lead
cause that cough seemed to come from the foundations He waylaid the
doctor after the examination was over and asked all kinds of questions
The doctor tried to keep a straight face but I guess Kenelm smelt a
rat

Anyway Hannah coughed for a day or two more and then her brother come
totin in a big bottle of medcine

There he says Thatll fix you

Whered you get it says she

Down to Henry Tubmans he says

Henry Tubman What on earth Why Henry Tubmans a horse doctor

I know he is says Kenelm solemn as a roostin pullet but weve
been fishin with the wrong bait Taint consumption thats ailin you
Hannah youve got the heaves

So Hannah didnt cough much more cause when she did Kenelm would
trot out the bottle of horse medcine and chuck overboard a couple of
barrels of sarcasm She tried openin all the windows sayin she needed
fresh air but he locked himself up in the kitchen and filled that so
full of smoke that you had to navigate it by dead reckonincouldnt
see to steer So she was about ready to give up somethin that anybody
but a stubborn critter like her would have done long afore

But one afternoon she was down to the sewin circle and the women
folks there havin finished pickin to pieces the characters of the
members not on hand started in to go on about the revivals and how
much good they was doin Most everybody had some relation if
twant nothin moren a husband that had stopped smokin and chewin
Everybody had some brand from the burnin to brag abouteverybody but
Hannah she could only set there and say shed done her best but that
Kenelm still herded with the goats

They was all sorry for her but the only one that had any advice to
give was Abbie Larkin she that was Abbie Dillinham fore she married
old man Larkin Larkin had one foot in the grave when she married him
and she managed to crowd the other one in inside of a couple of years
afterward Abbie is a widow of course and she is middlin goodlookin
and dresses pretty gay Larkin left her a little money but I guess
shes run through most of it by this time The circle folks was dyin
to talk about her but she was always on hand so early that they hardly
ever got a chance

Well after supper was over Abbie gets Hannah over in a corner and
says she

Miss Parker says she heres an advertisement I cut out of the
paper and saved apurpose for you I want you to look at it but you
mustnt tell anybody I gave it to you

So Hannah unfurls the piece of newspaper and twas an advertisement of
KillSmudge the sure cure for the tobacco habit You could give it to
the suffrer unbeknownst to him in his tea or soup or somethin and
in a couple of shakes hed no more smoke than hed lend money to his
brotherinlaw or do any other ridiclous thing There was testimonials
from half a dozen women that had tried it and everyone showed a clean
bill

Hannah read the advertisement through twice Well I never says she

Yes says Abbie and smiles

Of course says Hannah lookin scornful I wouldnt think of
tryin the stuff but Ill just take this home and read it over Its so
curious she says

Aint it says Abbie and smiles some more

So that night when Kenelm sat by the stove turnin the air blue his
sister set at the other side of the table with that advertisement hid
behind the Wellmouth Advocate readin and thinkin She wrote a letter
afore she went to bed and bought a dollars worth of stamps at the
postoffice next day And for a week she watched the mails the way one of
these city girls does when the summers most over and eight or nine of
her fellers have finished their vacations and gone back to work

About ten days after that Kenelm begins to feel kind of off his feed
sos to speak Somethin seemed to ail him and he couldnt make out what
twas Theyd had a good many cranberries on their bog that year and
Hannahd been cookin em up fast sos they wouldnt spile But one
night she brings on a cranberry pie and Kenelm turned up his nose at
it

More of that everlastin sour stuff he snorts Ive et cranbries
till my stomachs puckered up as if it worked with a gathrin string
Take it away I dont want it

But Kenelm youre always so fond of cranbry pie

Me It makes me shrivel just to look at it Pass that sugar bowl sos
I can sweeten ship

Next day twas salt fish and potatoes that want good Hed been
teasin for a saltfish dinner for ever so long so Hannahd fixed up
this one just to please him but he swallered two or three knifefuls and
then looked at her kind of sad and mournful

To think says he that Ive lived all these years to be pisoned
finlly And by my own sister too Well thats what comes of bein
wuth money Give me my pipe and let me forget my troubles

Course this kind of talk made Hannah mad but she argued that twas
the KillSmudge gettin in its work so she put a double dose into his
teacup that night and trusted in Providence

And the next day she noticed that he swallered hard between every pull
at his pipe and when at last he jumped out of his chair let out
a swear word and hove his pipe at the cat she felt considerble
encouraged She thought twas her duty however to warn him against
profane language but the answer she got was so much more prayerful than
his first remarks that she come about and headed for the sittinroom
quick

Well to make a long yarn short the KillSmudge done the busness
Kenelm stuck to smokin till he couldnt read a cigar sign without his
ballast shiftin and then he give it up Andas you might expect from
that kind of a manhe was more down on tobacco than the ComeOuter
parson himself He even got up in revival meetin and laid into it
hammer and tongs He was the best horrible example they had and
Hannah was so proud of him that she couldnt sleep nights She still
stuck to the KillSmudge thoughlayin in a fresh stock every once in
a whileand she dosed the tea about every other day sos her brother
wouldnt run no danger of relapse Im fraid Kenelm didnt get any too
much joy out of his meals

And so everything was all rightcordin to Hannahs reckoninand it
might have stayed all right if she hadnt took that trip to Washington
Etta Ellis was goin on a three weeks cutrate excursion and she
talked so much about it that Hannah got reckless and finlly said shed
go too

The only thing that worried her was leavin Kenelm She hated to do it
dreadful but he seemed tame enough and promised to change his flannels
if it got cold and to feed the cat reglar and to stay to home and
one thing and another so she thought twas safe to chance it She
cooked up a lot of pie and frosted cake and wrote out a kind of
timetable for him to eat and sleep by and then cried and kissed him
goodby

The first three days after she was gone Kenelm stayed round the house
and turned in early He was feelin fine but twas awful lonesome
The fourth day after breakfast he had a cravin to smoke Told me
afterward it seemed to him as if he MUST smoke or die of the fidgets At
last he couldnt stand it no longer but turned Hannahs timetable to
the wall and went out for a walk He walked and walked and walked It
got most dinner time and he had an appetite that he hadnt had afore
for months

Just as he was turnin into the road by the schoolhouse who should come
out on the piazza of the house on the corner but Abbie Larkin Shed
left the door open and the smell of dinner that blew through it was
tantalizin Abbie was dressed in her Sunday togs and her hair was
frizzed till she couldnt wrinkle her forehead If the truth was known
I callate shed seen Kenelm go past her house on the way downtown and
was layin for him when he come back but she acted dreadful surprised

Why Mr Parker says she how DO you do Seemss if I hadnt
seen you for an age Aint it dreadful lonesome at your house now your
sisters away

Kenelm colored up somehe always histed danger signals when women
heave in sightand agreed that twas kind of poky bein all alone Then
they talked about the weather and about the price of coal and about
the new plush coat Capn Jabez Baileys wife had just got and how folks
didnt see how she could afford it with Jabez out of work and so
on And all the time the smell of things cookin drifted through the
doorway Finlly Abbie says says she

Was you goin home Mr Parker

Yes maam says Kenelm I was callatin to go home and cook
somethin for dinner

Well there now says Abbie I wonder why I didnt think of it
afore Why dont you come right in and have dinner with me Its ALL
ready and theres plenty for two DO come Mr Parker to please ME

Course Kenelm said he couldnt and likewise of course he did
Twas a smashin dinnerchicken and mashed potatoes and mince pie and
the land knows what He ate till he was full clear to the hatches
and it seemed to him that nothin ever tasted quite so good The widow
smiled and purred and colored up and said it seemed SO good to have a
man at the table seemed like the old days when Danlmeanin the late
lamentedwas on deck and so forth

Then when the eatin was over she says I was expectin my cousin
Benjamin down for a week or so but he cant come Hes a great smoker
and I bought these cigars for him You might as well use them afore they
dry up

Afore Kenelm could stop her she rummaged a handful of cigars out of the
table drawer in the settinroom

There she says Light right up and be comfortable Itll seem just
like old times Danl was such a smoker Oh my and she gave a little
squeal I forgot youve stopped smokin

Well there was the cigars lookin as temptin as a squid to a
codfish and there was Kenelm hankerin for em so his fingers twitched
and there was Abbie lookin dreadful disappinted but tryin to make
believe she wasnt You dont need a spyglass to see what happened

Id like to says Kenelm pickin up one of the cigars Id like to
mighty well buthere he bites off the endtwouldnt hardly do now
would it You see

I see says Abbie scratchin a match but WELL never tell Well
have it for our secret wont we Mr Parker

So thats how Kenelm took his first tumble from grace He told me all
about it one day a good while afterward He smoked three of the cigars
afore he went home and promised to come to supper the next afternoon

You DO look so comfortable Mr Parker purrs Abbie as sweet and
syrupy as a molasses stopper It must be SUCH a comfort to a man to
smoke I dont care WHAT the minister says you can smoke here just as
much as you want to It must be pretty hard to live in a house where you
cant enjoy yourself I shouldnt think it would seem like home A man
like you NEEDS a good home Why how I do run on

Oh there aint really nothin the matter with the Widow Larkinso
furs smartness is concerned there aint

And for five days more Kenelm ate his meals at Abbies and smoked and
was happy happiern hed been for months

Meantime Hannah and Etta was visitin the Presidentthat is to say
they was lookin over the White House fence and sayin My stars and
Aint it elegant Nights when the sightseein was over what they did
mostly was to gloat over how mean and jealous theyd make the untraveled
common tribe at sewin circle feel when they got back home They could
just see themselves workin on the logcabin quilt for the next sale
and slingin out little reminders like Land sakes What were
talkin about reminds me of what Etta and me saw when we was in the
Congressional Librry YOU remember that Etta And that would be
Ettas hint to look cute and giggle and say Well I should say I DID
And all the rest of the circlers would smile kind of unhealthy smiles
and try to look as if trips to Washington want nothin THEY wouldnt
go if you hired em to You know the game if youve ever been to sewin
circle

But all this plannin was knocked in the head by a letter that Hannah
got on an afternoon about a week after she left home It was short but
there was meat in it It said If you want to keep your brother from
marryin Abbie Larkin you had better come home quick Twas signed A
Friend

Did Hannah come home Well didnt she She landed at Orham the next
night And she done some thinkin on the way too She kept out of the
way of everybody and went straight up to the house Twas dark and shut
up but the back door key was under the mat as usual so she got in all
right The plants hadnt been watered for two days at least the clock
had stopped the cats saucer was licked dry as a contribution box and
the critter itself was underfoot every second whoopin for somethin
to eat The whole thing pretty nigh broke Hannahs heart but she want
the kind to give up while there was a shot in the locker

She went to the closet and found that Kenelms Sunday hat and coat was
gone Then she locked the back door again and cut acrost the lots down
to Abbies She crept round the back way and peeked under the curtain
at the settinroom window There set Abbie lookin sweet and sugary
Likewise there was Kenelm lookin mighty comfortable with a big
cigar in his mouth and more on the table side of him Hannah gritted her
teeth but she kept quiet

About ten minutes after that Chris Badger was considerble surprised to
hear a knock at the back door of his store and to find that twas Hannah
that had knocked

Mr Badger says Hannah polite and smilin I want to buy a box of
the best cigars youve got

Maam says Chris thinkin twas about time to send for the
constable or the doctorone or tother

Yes says Hannah if you please Oh and Mr Badger please dont
tell anyone I bought em PLEASE dont to oblige me

So Chris trotted out the cigarsten cents straight they wasand said
nothin to nobody which is a faculty he has when it pays to have it

When Kenelm came home that night he was knocked pretty nigh off his
pins to find his sister waitin for him He commenced a long rigmarole
about where hed been but Hannah didnt ask no questions She said that
Washington was mighty fine but home and Kenelm was good enough for her
Said the thoughts of him alone had been with her every minute and she
just HAD to cut the trip short Kenelm want any too enthusiastic to
hear it

Breakfast next mornin was a dream Hannah had been up since five
oclock gettin it ready There was everything on that table that Kenelm
liked special And it all tasted fine and he ate enough for four When
twas over Hannah went to the closet and brought out a bundle

Kenelm she says heres somethin I brought you thatll
surprise you Ive noticed since Ive been away that about everybody
smokessenators and judges and even Smithsonian Institute folks And
when I see how much comfort they get out of it my conscience hurt me
to think that Id deprived my brother of what he got such a sight of
pleasure from Kenelm you can begin smokin again right off Heres
a box of cigars I bought on purpose for you theyre the kind the
President smokes

Which want a bad yarn for a church member that hadnt had any more
practice than Hannah had

Well Kenelm was paralyzed but he lit up one of the cigars and found
twas better than Abbies brand He asked Hannah what she thought the
church folks would say but she said she didnt care what they said
her travels had broadened her mind and she couldnt cramp herself to the
ideas of a little narrow place like East Wellmouth

Dinner that day was a bigger meal than breakfast and two of the cigars
went fine after it Kenelm hemmed and hawed and finlly said that he
wouldnt be home to supper said hed got to go downtown and would get a
bite at the Travlers Rest or somewheres It surprised him to find that
Hannah didnt raise objections but she didnt not a one Just smiled
and said All right and told him to have a good time And Abbies
supper didnt seem so good to him that night and her cigarsbein five
centerswant in it with that Washington box

Hannah didnt have dinner the next day until two oclock but twas
worth waitin for Turkey was twentythree cents a pound but she had
one and plum puddin too She kept pressin Kenelm to have a little
more so twas after three when they got up from the table

Twas a rainy drizzly afternoon and the stove felt mighty homey and
cozy So did the big rocker that Hannah transplanted from the parlor to
the settinroom That chair had been a kind of sacred throne afore and
to set in it had been sort of sacrilegious but there twas and Kenelm
didnt object And those President cigars certainly filled the bill

About halfpast five Kenelm got up and looked out of the window The
rain come spattin against the pane and the wind whined and sounded
mean Kenelm went back to the chair again Then he got up and took
another observation At last he goes back to the chair stretches
himself out puts his feet against the stove pulls at the cigar and
says he

I was callatin to go downtown on a busness trip sames I did last
night But I guess he saysI guess I wont Its too comfortble
here says he

And I callate said Captain Obed in conclusion that afore Hannah
turned in that night she gave herself three cheers Shed gained a
tack on Abbie Larkin that had put Abbie out of the race for that time
anyhow

But who sent the friend letter asked Thankful whose thoughts had
been diverted from her own troubles by hearing those of Miss Parker

The captain laughed

Thats a mystery even yet he said Im pretty sure Hannah thinks
twas Elvira Paine Elvira lives acrost the road from Abbie Larkin and
bein a single woman with mighty little hopes of recovery naturally
might be expected to enjoy upsettin anybody elses chance But at
any rate Mrs Barnes the whole thing bears out what I said at the
beginnin takin other folks advice about your own affairs is mighty
risky I hope if you do go ahead with your boardinhouse plan it
wont be because I called it a good one

Thankful smiled and then sighed No she said if I go ahead with
it itll be because Ive made up my mind to not on account of anybody
elses advice Ive steered my own course for quite a long spell and I
shant signal for a pilot now Well here we are home againor at East
Wellmouth anyhow

So we be Better come right to Hannahs along with me hadnt you You
must have had enough of the Holt WaldorfAstory by this time

But Thankful insisted upon going to the hotel and there her new
friendfor she had begun to think of him as thatleft her She
informed him of her intention to remain in East Wellmouth for another
day and a half and he announced his intention of seeing her again before
she left

Just want to keep an eye on you he said With all of Mrs Holts
temptin meals set afore you you may get gout or somethin from
overeatin Either that or Winnie Sll talk you deef I feel a kind
of responsibility bein as Im liable to be your nextdoor neighbor
if that boardinhouse does start up and I want you to set sail with a
clean bill of health If you sight a suspiciouslookin craft kind
of antique in build broad in the beam and makin heavy weather up the
hillsif you sight that kind of craft beatin down in this direction
tomorrow youll know its me Good day

Thankful lay awake for hours that night thinking planning and
replanning More than once she decided that she had been too hasty that
her scheme involved too great a risk and that after all she had better
abandon it But each time she changed her mind and at last fell asleep
determining not to think any more about it but to wait until Mr Cobb
came to accept or decline the mortgage Then she would make a final
decision

The next day passed somehow though it seemed to her as if it never
would and early the following forenoon came Solomon himself The man of
business was driving an elderly horse which bore a faint resemblance
to its owner being small and thin and badly in need of a hairdressers
services If the animal had possessed whiskers and could have tugged at
them Thankful was sure it would have done it

Solomon tugged at his own whiskers almost constantly during that
forenoon He and Mrs Barnes visited the Captain Abner place and
Solomon inspected every inch of its exterior For some reason or
other he absolutely refused to go inside His conversation during the
inspection was for the most part sniffs and grunts and it was not
until it was ended and they stood together at the gate that he spoke to
the point and then only because his companion insisted

Well said Thankful

Mr Cobb weeded

Eh he said

Thats what I sayeh What are you goin to do about that mortgage
Mr Cobb

More weeding Then Waal II dont callate to want to be
unreasonable nor nothin but I aint real keen about takin no mortgage
on that property not myself I aint

Well it is yourself Im askin to take it So you wont hey All
right thats all I wanted to know

Nownownow hold on Hold on I aint sayin I WONT take it IId
like to be accommodatin specially to a relation But

Never mind the relation business I found out what you think
of relations afore you found out I was one And I aint askin
accommodation This is just plain business seems to me Will you let me
have two thousand dollars on a mortgage on this place

Mr Cobb fidgeted I couldnt let you have that much he said I
couldnt II he wrenched the next sentence loose after what seemed
a violent effort I might let you have half of ita thousand say

But Thankful refused to say a thousand That was ridiculous she
declared By degrees and a hundred at a time Solomon raised his offer
to fifteen hundred This being the sum Mrs Barnes had considered in the
first placeand having asked for the two thousand merely because of her
judgment of human natureshe announced that she would think over the
offer Then came the question of time Here Mr Cobb was firm Three
yearstwo yearshe would not consider At last he announced that
he would take a oneyear mortgage on the Barnes property for fifteen
hundred dollars and that was all he would do

And I wouldnt do that for nobody else he declared You bein my
relation I dont knows it aint my duty as a perfessin Christian
toto help you out I hadnt ought to afford it but Im willin to go
so far

Thankful shook her head Im glad you said PROFESSIN Christian
she observed Well drawing a long breath then I suppose Ive got
to say yes or no    And Ill say yes she added firmly And well
call it settled

They parted before the hotel She was to return to South Middleboro that
afternoon Mr Cobb was to prepare the papers and forward them for her
signature after which upon receipt of them duly signed he would send
her the fifteen hundred dollar check

Solomon climbed into the buggy Well goodby he said I hope youll
do fustrate The interestll be paid regular of course Im real
pleased to meet youerCousin Thankful Be sure you sign them papers
in the right place Goodby Oherersometimes Ill be droppin
in to see you after you get your boardinhouse goin I come to East
Wellmouth once in a while YesyesIll come and see you You can tell
me more about Captain Abner you know IdId like to hear what he
said to you about me Goodby

That afternoon once more in the depotwagon which had been refitted
with its fourth wheel Thankful on her way to the Wellmouth railway
station passed her property The old house its weatherbeaten
shingles a cold gray in the halflight of the mistshrouded sinking
sun looked lonely and deserted A chill wind came from the sea and the
surf at the foot of the bluff moaned and splashed and sighed

Thankful sighed also

Whats the matter asked Winnie S

Oh nothin much I wish I was a prophet thats all Id like to be
able to look ahead a year

Winnie S whistled Judas priest he said Sod I But if Id see
myself drivin this everlastin rigout Id wished I hadnt looked I
dont knows Id want to see ahead as furs that after all

Thankful sighed again I dont know as I do either she admitted




CHAPTER VII


March so to speak blew itself out April came and went May was here
And on the seventeenth of May the repairs on the Capn Abner place
were completed The last carpenter had gone leaving his shavings and
chips behind him The last painter had spilled his last splash of paint
on the sprouting grass beneath the spotless white window sills The last
paperhanger had departed Winnie S was loading into what he called a
truck wagon the excelsior and bagging in which the final consignment
of new furniture had been wrapped during its journey from Boston About
the front yard Kenelm Parker was moving rake in hand In the kitchen
Imogene the girl from the Orphans Home in Boston who had been engaged
to act as hired help was arranging the new pots and pans on the
closet shelf and singing Showers of Blessings cheerfully if not
tunefully

Yes the old Capn Abner place was rejuvenated and transformed and on
the following Monday it would be the Capn Abner place no longer it
would then become the High Cliff House and open its doors to hopedfor
boarders either of the summer or alltheyear variety

The name had been Emily Howes choice She and Mrs Barnes had carried
on a lengthy and voluminous correspondence and the selection of a name
had been left to Emily To her also had been intrusted the selection of
wallpapers furniture and the few pictures which Thankful had felt able
to afford These were but few for the cost of repairing and refitting
had been much larger than the original estimate The fifteen hundred
dollars raised on the mortgage had gone and of the money obtained by the
sale of the cranberry bog sharesMrs Pearsons legacynearly half had
gone also Estimates are one thing and actual expenditures are another
a fact known to everyone who has either built a house or rebuilt one
and more than once during the repairing and furnishing process Thankful
had repented of her venture and wished she had not risked the plunge
But having risked it backing out was impossible Neither was it
possible to stop halfway As she said to Captain Obed Theres enough
halfway decent boardinhouses and hotels in this neighborhood now
Theres about as much need of another of that kind as there is of an
icehouse at the North Pole Either this boardinhouse of mine must be
the very best there can be price considered or it mustnt be at all
Thats the way I look at it

The captain had of course agreed with her His advice had been
invaluable He had helped in choosing carpenters and painters and it was
owing to his suggestion that Mrs Barnes had refrained from engaging an
East Wellmouth young woman to help in the kitchen

You could find one of course said the captain Theres two or three
I could think of right off now who would probably take the job but two
out of the three wouldnt be much account anyhow and the only one that
would is Sarah Mullet and shes engaged to a Trumet feller Now let
alone the prospect of Sarahs gettin married and leavin you most
any time theres another reason for not hirin her Shes the
everlastinest gossip in Ostable County and thats sayin somethin
What Sarah dont know about everybodys private affairs she guesses and
she always guesses out loud Inside of a fortnight shed have all you
ever done and a whole lot you never thought of doin advertised from
Race Pint to Sagamore Shes a reglar talkin foghorn if there was
such a thingonly a foghorn shuts down in clear weather and SHE dont
shut down day or night Talks in her sleep I shouldnt wonder If I
was you Mrs Barnes I wouldnt bother with any help from round here
Id hire a girl from Boston or somewheres then you could be skipper of
your own ship

Thankful after thinking the matter over decided that the advice was
good The difficulty of course was in determining the somewhere from
which the right sort of servant one willing to work for a small wage
might be obtained At length she wrote to a Miss Coffin once a nurse in
Middleboro but now matron of an orphans home in Boston Miss Coffins
reply was to the effect that she had in her institution a girl who
might in time prove to be just the sort which her friend desired


Of course she wrote she isnt at all a competent servant now but
she is bright and anxious to learn And she is a good girl although
something of a character Her Christian name is Marguerite at least
she says it is What her other name is goodness only knows She has been
with us now for nearly seven years Before that she lived with and took
care of a drunken old woman who said she was the girls aunt though I
doubt if she was Suppose I send her to you on trial you can send her
back to us if she doesnt suit It would be a real act of charity to
give her a chance and I think you will like her in spite of her funny
ways


This doubtful recommendation caused Thankful to shake her head She had
great confidence in Miss Coffins judgment but she was far from certain
that Marguerite would suit However guarded inquiries in Wellmouth
and Trumet strengthened her conviction that Captain Obed knew what he
was talking about and the time approaching when she must have some
sort of servant she at last in desperation wrote her friend to send
the Marguerite one along for a months trial

The new girl arrived two days later Winnie S brought her down in the
depotwagon in company with her baggage a battered old valise and an
ancient umbrella She clung to each of these articles with a death grip
evidently fearful that someone might try to steal them She appeared
to be of an age ranging from late sixteen to early twenty and had a
turnedup nose and reddish hair drawn smoothly back from her forehead
and fastened with a round comb Her smile was of the wont come off
variety

Thankful met her at the back door and ushered her into the kitchen the
room most free from workmen at the moment

How do you do said the lady Im real glad to see you Hope you had
a nice trip down in the cars

Lordy yesm was the emphatic answer accompanied by a brilliant
smile I never had such a long ride in my life Twas just like bein
rich I made believe I WAS rich most all the way except when a man set
down in the seat alongside of me and wanted to talk Then I didnt make
believe none I bet you

A man grinned Thankful What sort of a man

I dont know One of the railroad men I guess twas anyhow he was
a fresh young guy with some sort of uniform hat on He asked me if I
didnt want him to put my bag up in the rack He said you couldnt be
too careful of a bag like that I told him never mind my bag it was
where it belonged and it stayed shut up which was moren you could say
of some folks in this world I guess he understood anyhow he beat it
Lordy with another smile I knew how to treat HIS kind Miss Coffins
told me enough times to look out for strange men Is this where Im
goin to live maam

Whywhy yes if youre a good girl and try hard to please and to
learn NowerMargueritethats your name isnt it

No maam my names Imogene

Imowhich Why I thought you was Marguerite Miss Coffin hasnt sent
another girl has she

No maam Im the one My name used to be Marguerite but its goin
to be Imogene now Ive wanted to change for a long while but up there
to the Home theyd got kind of used to Marguerite so twas easier to
let it go at that I like Imogene lots better I got it out of a book

Butbut you cant change your name like that Isnt Marguerite your
real name

Nom Anyhow I guess taint I got that out of a book too Lordy
with a burst of enthusiasm Ive had more names in my time My Aunt
Bridget she called me Mag when she didnt make it somethin worse And
when I first came to the Home the kids called me Fire Alarm cause my
hair was red And the cook they had then called me Lonesome cause I
guess I looked that way And the matronnot Miss Coffin but the other
onecalled me Maggie I didnt like that so when Miss Coffin showed
up I told her I was Marguerite But Id rather be Imogene now if you
aint particular maam

Whyumwell I dont knows I am only seems to me Id settle on one
or tother and stay put Whats your last name

I aint decided Montgomerys a kind of nice name and sos St John
or Wolcottthere used to be a Governor Wolcott you know I spose now
Im out workin for myself I ought to have a last name Maybe you can
pick one out for me maam

Humph Maybe I can Ive helped pick out first names for babies in my
time but pickin out a last name for anybody would be somethin new
I will give in But Ill try if you want me to And you must try to do
what I want and to please me Will you promise me that

Lordy yesm

Um Well you might begin by tryin not to say Lordy quite so many
times That would please me for a start

All rightm I got in the habit of sayin it I guess When I first
come to the Home I used to say God sakes but the matron didnt like
that

Mercy on us I dont wonder WellerImogene now Ill show you the
house and your room and all I hope you like em

There was no doubt of the liking Imogene was delighted with everything
When she was shown the sunny attic bedroom which was to be hers she
clapped her hands

Its elegant maam she cried Just grand OH its too splendid to
believe and yet there aint any makebelieve in it Lordy Excuse me
maam I forgot I wont say it again Ill wait and see what you say
and then Ill say that And now briskly I guess you think its time
I was gettin to work All right I can work if I aint got no other
accomplishments Im all ready to begin

As a worker she was a distinct success There was not a lazy bone in her
energetic body She was up and stirring each morning at five oclock
and she evinced an eager willingness to learn that pleased Mrs Barnes
greatly Her knowledge of cookery was limited and deadly but as
Thankful had planned to do most of the cooking herself for the
first season at least this made little difference Altogether the
proprietress of the High Cliff House was growing more and more sure that
her female hired help was destined to prove a treasure

I am real glad you like it here so well Imogene she said at the end
of a fortnight I was afraid you might be lonesome down here so far
from the city

Imogene laughed Who Me she exclaimed I guess not maam Dont
catch me bein lonesome while theres folks around I care about I was
lonesome enough when I first came to the Home and the kids used to
make fun of me But I aint lonesome now with you so kind and nice No
indeedy I aint lonesome and I aint goin to be You watch

Captain Obed heartily approved of Imogene Of Kenelm Parker as
manofallwork his approval was much less enthusiastic He had been
away attending to his fish weirs when Kenelm was hired and the bargain
was made before he returned It was Hannah Parker who had recommended
her brother for the position She had coaxed and pleaded and at last
Thankful had consented to Kenelms taking the place on trial

Youll need a nice trustworthy man to do chores said Hannah Now
Kenelms honest there aint a more honest conscientious man in East
Wellmouth than my brother if I do say it Take him in the matter of
that umbrella he lost the night you first came Mrs Barnes Take that
for instance Hed left it or lost it somewheres he knew that and the
ordinary person would have been satisfied but not Kenelm No siree
He hunted and hunted till he found that umbrella and come fetchin of it
home Twas a week afore he did that but when he did I says Well I
says you have got more sticktoit than I thought you had You

Where did he find it interrupted Thankful

Land knows He didnt seem to know himselfjust found it he said
He acts so sort of upsot and shameful about that umbrella that he and
I dont talk about it any more But it did show that he had a sense of
responsibleness and a good one Anybody thatll stick to and persecute
a hunt for a lost thing the way he done will stick to a job the same
way Dont you think so yourself Mrs Barnes

Thankful was not convinced but she yielded When she told Captain Bangs
he laughed and observed Yup well maybe so Judgin by other jobs
Kenelms had hell stick to this one same as he does to his bed of
a Sunday morninlay down on it and go to sleep However I presume
likely he ought to have the chance Of course Hannahs idea is plain
enough Longs hes at work over here she can keep an eye on him And
its a nice satisfactory distance from the widow Larkin too

So Kenelm came daily to work and did worksome When he did not he
always had a plausible excuse As a selfexcuser he was a shining light

Thankful had during the repairs on the house waited more or less
anxiously for developments concerning the mystery of the little back
bedroom Painters and paperhangers had worked in that room as in others
but no reports of strange sounds or groans or voices had come from
there During the week preceding the day of formal opening Thankful
herself had spent her nights in that room but had not heard nor seen
anything unusual She was now pretty thoroughly convinced that the storm
had been responsible for the groans and that the rest had been due to
her imagination However she determined to let that room and the larger
one adjoining last of all she would take no chances with the lodgers
she couldnt afford it

Among the equipment of the High Cliff House or its outbuildings were a
horse a pig and a dozen hens and two roosters Captain Obed bought
the horse at Mrs Barnes request a docile animal of a sedate age A
secondhand buggy and a secondhand open wagon he also bought The
pig and hens Thankful bought herself in Trumet She positively would
not consent to the pigs occupying the sty beneath the woodshed and
adjoining the potato cellar so a new pen was built in the hollow at
the rear of the house Imogene was tremendously interested in the
livestock She begged the privilege of naming each animal and fowl
Mrs Barnes had been encouraging the girl to read literature more
substantial than the Fireside Companion tales in which she had
hitherto delighted and had as a beginning lent her a volume of United
States history one of several discarded schoolbooks which Emily Howes
sent at her cousins request Imogene was immensely interested in the
history She had just finished the Revolution and the effect of her
reading was evident when she announced the names she had selected

The horse being the most important of all the livestock she christened
George Washington The pig was named Patrick Henry The largest hen
was Martha Washington As to them two roosters she explained I did
think Id name the big handsome one John Hancock and the littlest one
George Three They didnt like each other maam that was plain at the
start so I thought theyd ought to be on different sides But the very
first fight they had George pretty near licked the stuffin out of John
so Ive decided to change the names around That ought to fix it dont
you think so maam

On the seventeenth the High Cliff House was formally opened It was
much too early to expect summer boarders but there were three of the
permanent variety who had already engaged rooms Of these the first was
Caleb Hammond an elderly widower and retired cranberry grower whose
wife had died fifteen years before and who had been boarding around in
Wellmouth Centre and Trumet ever since Caleb was fairly welltodo and
although he had the reputation of being somewhat close in many matters
and sot in his ways he was a respected member of society He selected
a room on the second floornot a front room but one on the side
looking toward the Colfax estate The room on the other side across the
hall was taken by Miss Rebecca Timpson who had taught the upstairs
classes in the Wellmouth school ever since she was nineteen a
considerable period of time

The large front rooms those overlooking the bluff and the sea Thankful
had intended reserving for guests from the city but when Mr Heman
Daniels expressed a wish to engage and occupy one of them that on the
left of the hall she reconsidered and Mr Daniels obtained his desire
It was hard to refuse a personage like Mr Daniels anything He was not
an elderly man neither was he strictly speaking a young one His age
was perhaps somewhere in the late thirties or early forties and he was
East Wellmouths leading lawyer in fact its only one

Heman was a bachelor and rather goodlooking That his bachelorhood was
a matter of choice and not necessity was a point upon which all of East
Wellmouth agreed He was a favorite with the ladies most of them and
according to common report there was a rich widow in Bayport who
would marry him at a minutes notice if he gave the notice So far
apparently he had not given it He was a smart lawyer everyone said
that and it is probable that he himself would have been the last to
deny the accusation He was dignified and suave and gracious also
persuasive when he chose to be

He had been boarding with the Holts but like the majority of the hotel
lodgers and mealers was very willing to change The location of the
High Cliff House was so he informed Thankful the sole drawback to its
availability as a home for him

If a bachelor may be said to have a home Mrs Barnes he added
graciously However I am sure even an unfortunate single person like
myself may find a real home under your roof You see your reputation
had preceded you maam Ha ha yes As I say the location is the only
point which has caused me to hesitate Myeroffices are on the Main
Road near the postoffice and that is nearly a mile from here But well
waive that point maam Six dollars a week for the room and seven for
meals you say Thirteen dollarsan unlucky number Ha ha Suppose we
call it twelve and dodge the bad luck eh That would seem reasonable
dont you think

Thankful shook her head Altogether too reasonable Mr Daniels Im
afraid she replied Ive cut my rates so close now that Im afraid
theyll catch cold in bad weather Thirteen dollars a week may be
unlucky but twelve would be a sight more unluckyfor me I can let you
have a side room of course and that would be cheaper

But Mr Daniels did not wish a side room he desired a front room
and at last consented to pay the regular rate for it But when the
arrangement was concluded Thankful could not help feeling that she had
taken advantage of an unworldly innocence

Captain Obed Bangs when she told him reassured her

Dont worry maam he said I wouldnt lay awake nights fearin Id
got ahead of Heman Daniels much If you have got ahead of him youre the
only person I ever see that did and you ought to be proud instead of
ashamed And Id get him to make his offer in writin and you lock up
the writin

Why Why Captain Obed How you do talk You dont mean that Mr
Daniels is a cheat do you You dont mean such a thing as THAT

The captain waved a protesting hand

No no he declared I wouldnt call any lawyer a cheat Thats too
onesided a deal to be good business The expense of hirin counsel is
all on one side if it ever comes to a libel suit And besides I dont
think Daniels is a cheat I never heard of him doin anything that
want legally honest Hes sharp and hes smart but hes straight
enough I was only jokin Mrs Barnes Sometimes I think I ought to
hang a lantern on my jokes then folks would see em quicker

So Mr Daniels came and Mr Hammond came and so also did Miss Timpson
The first dinner was served in the big diningroom and it was a success
everyone said so Beside the boarders there were invited guests Captain
Bangs and Hannah Parker and Kenelm also It was a disappointment to
Thankful although she kept the disappointment to herself the fact
that the captain had not shifted what he called his moorings to her
establishment She had hoped he might she liked him and she believed
him to be just the sort of boarder she most desired It may be that he
too was disappointed What he said was

You see maam Ive been anchorin along with Hannah and Kenelm now
for quite a spell They took me in when twas a choice between
messin at the Holt place or eatin grass in the back yard like King
Nebuchadnezzar Hannah dont keep a reglar boardinhouse but she does
sort of count on me as one of the family and I dont feel twould be
right to shiftnot yet anyhow But maybe I can pilot other craft into
High Cliff Harbor even if I dont call it my own home port

That first dinner was a bountiful meal Miss Parker expressed the
general opinion although it was expressed in her own way when she
said

My sakes alive Mrs Barnes If THIS is the way youre goin to feed
your boarders right along then I say its remarkable Ive been up to
Boston a good many times in my life and Ive been to Washington once
but in all MY experience at hightoned hotels I never set down to
a better meal Its a regular Beelzebubs feast like the one in
Scripturleavin out the writin on the wall of course

Kenelm ate enough for two and then announcing that he couldnt heave
away no more time having work to do retired to the rear of the barn
where the rake beside him he slumbered peacefully for an hour

There said Thankful to Imogene that night Weve started anyhow And
twas a good start if I do say it

Good exclaimed Imogene I should say twas good But if them
boarders eat as much every day as they have this one twont be a
start twill be a finish LorI mean mercy on us maamif this is a
boardinhouse Id like to know what a palace is Why a king never had
better grub served to him Huh I guess he didnt Old George Three used
to eat gruel like alike a sick orphan at the Home Oh he did maam
honest I read about it in one of them history books you lent me He was
a tightwad old gink he was Are you goin to give these guys as much
every meal maam

I mean to of course declared Mrs Barnes Nobody shall starve at my
table And please Imogene dont call people ginks and guys That aint
nice talk for a young woman

Imogene apologized and promised to be more careful But she thought a
great deal and at the end of the first week she imparted her thoughts
to Captain Obed

Say Captain Bangs she said do you know what is the matter with
the name of this place I tell you what I think is the matter It hadnt
ought to be the HIGH Cliff House The CHEAP Cliff House would be a sight
better Givin guysfolks I meanfifteendollaraweek board for
seven dollars may be mighty nice for them but its plaguy poor business
for Mrs Thankful

The captain shook his head he had been thinking too and his
conclusions were much the same

You mustnt find fault with Mrs Barnes Imogene he said Shes a
mighty fine woman

Fine woman You bet she is Shes too plaguy fine thats the trouble
with her Shes so afraid her boardersll starve that she forgets all
about makin money Shes the best woman there is in the world but she
needs a mean partner Then the two of them might average up all right I
guess

Captain Obed rubbed his chin Think she needs a business manager eh
he observed

Imogene nodded emphatically She needs two of them she declared One
to manage the place and another to keep that Parker man workin He can
eat more and talk more and work less than any guy ever I see Why hed
spend half his time in this kitchen gassin with me if Id let him But
you bet I dont let him

The captain thought more and more during the days that followed At
length he wrote a letter to Emily Howes at South Middleboro In it he
expressed his fear that Mrs Barnes although in all other respects
perfect was a too generous provider to be a success as a
boardinghouse keeper in East Wellmouth


Shell have boarders enough you neednt worry about that he wrote
but shell lose money on every one Ive tried to hint but she dont
take the hint and it aint any of my affair rightly speaking so I
cant speak out plain Cant you write her a sort of warning afore its
too late Or better still cant you come down here and talk to her I
wish you would Excuse my nosing in and writing you this way please
Im doing it just because I want to see her win out in the race thats
all I wish youd answer this pretty prompt if you dont mind


But the reply he hoped for did not come and he began to fear that he had
made a bad matter worse by writing Doubtless Miss Howes resented his
nosing in

Thankful now began advertising in the Boston papers And the answers to
the ads began to arrive Sometimes men and women from the city came down
to inspect the High Cliff House preparatory to opening negotiations for
summer quarters They inspected the house itself interviewed Thankful
strolled along the bluff admiring the view and sampled a meal Then
almost without exception they agreed upon terms and selected rooms
That the house would be full from top to bottom by the first of July
was now certain But as Imogene said to Captain Bangs If we lose five
dollars a week on everyone of em that aint nothin to hurrah about
seems to me

The captain had not piloted any new boarders to the High Cliff Perhaps
he thought under the circumstances this would be a doubtful kindness
But the time came when he did bring one there And the happenings
leading to that result were these

It was a day in the first week in June and Captain Obed having business
in Wellmouth Centre had hired George Washington Mrs Barnes horse
and the buggy and driven there The business done he left the placid
George moored to a hitchingpost by the postoffice and strolled over to
the railway station to watch the noon train come in

The train was of course late but not very late in this instance and
the few passengers alighted on the station platform The captain seated
on the baggagetruck noticed one of these passengers in particular He
was a young fellow smoothfaced and tall and as suitcase in hand he
swung from the last car and strode up the platform it seemed to Captain
Obed as if there was something oddly familiar in that stride and the
set of his square shoulders His face too seemed familiar The captain
felt as if he should recognize himbut he did not

He came swinging on until he was opposite the baggagetruck Then he
stopped and looked searchingly at the bulky form of the man seated upon
it He stepped closer and looked again Then with a twinkle in his
quiet gray eye he did a most amazing thinghe began to sing To
singnot loudly of course but rather under his breath And this is
what he sang

 Said all the little fishes that swim there below
 Its the Liverpool packet Good Lord let her go

To the average person this would have sounded like the wildest insanity
But not to Captain Obed Bangs of East Wellmouth The captain sprang from
the truck and held out his hand

Johnnie Kendrick he shouted Its Johnnie Kendrick I do believe
Well I swan to man

The young man laughed and seizing the captains hand shook it
heartily

I am glad you do he said If you hadnt swanned to man I should have
been afraid there was more change in Captain Obed Bangs than I cared to
see Captain Obed how are you

Captain Obed shook his head II he stammered Well I callate my
timbers are fairly strong if they can stand a shock like this Johnnie
Kendrick of all folks in the world

The very same Captain

And you knew me right off Well done for you John Why its all of
twenty odd year since you used to set on a nail keg in my boathouse
and tease me into singing the Dreadnought chanty I remember that Good
land I ought to remember the only critter on earth that ever ASKED me
to sing Ho ho but you was a little towheaded shaver then and now
look at you What are you doin away down here

John Kendrick shook his head I dont know that Im quite sure myself
Captain he said I have some suspicions of course but they may not
be confirmed First of all Im going over to East Wellmouth so just
excuse me a minute while I speak to the driver of the bus

He was hurrying away but his companion caught his arm

Heave to John he ordered Ive got a horse and a buggy here myself
such as they are and unless youre dead sot on bookin passage in
Winnie Sswhat did you call itbustId be mighty glad to have you
make the trip along with me No no Twont be any trouble Come on

Five minutes later they were seated in the buggy and George Washington
was jogging with dignified deliberation along the road toward East
Wellmouth

And why demanded Captain Obed have you come to Wellmouth again
after all these years

Mr Kendrick smiled

Well Captain Bangs he said it is barely possible that Ive come
here to stay

To stay You dont mean to stay for good

Well that too is possible Being more or less optimistic well hope
that if I do stay it will be for good Im thinking of living here

His companion turned around on the seat to stare at him

Livin here he repeated You What on earth What are you goin to
do

The passengers eyes twinkled but his tone was solemn enough

Nothing very likely he replied Thats what Ive been doing for
some time

Butbut the last I heard of you you was practicin law over to New
York

So I was That for a young lawyer without funds or influence is as
near doing nothing as anything I can think of

Butbut John

Just a minute Captain The buts are there plenty of them Before we
reach them however perhaps Id better tell you the story of my life
It isnt exciting enough to make you nervous but it may explain a few
things

He told his story It was not the story of his life his whole life by
any means The captain already knew the first part of that life He had
known the Kendricks ever since he had known anyone Every person in
East Wellmouth of middle age or older remembered when the two brothers
Samuel Kendrick and Bailey KendrickBailey was Johns fatherlived in
the village and were the big men of the community Bailey was the more
important and respected at that time for Samuel speculated in stocks
a good deal and there were seasons when he was so near bankruptcy that
gossip declared he could not pass the poorhouse without shivering If
it had not been for his brother Bailey so that same gossip affirmed
he would most assuredly have gone under but Bailey lent him money and
helped him in many ways Both brothers were widowers and each had a son
but Samuels boy Erastus was fifteen years older than John

The families moved from Wellmouth when John was six years old They went
West and there so it was said the positions of the brothers changed
Samuels luck turned he made some fortunate stock deals and became
wealthy Bailey however lost all he had in bad mining ventures and
sank almost to poverty Both had been dead for years now but Samuels
son Erastushe much preferred to be called E Holliday Kendrickwas
a man of consequence in New York a financier with offices on Broad
Street and a home on Fifth Avenue John the East Wellmouth people had
last heard of as having worked his way through college and law school
and as practicing his profession in the big city

So much Captain Bangs knew And John Kendrick told him the rest The
road to success for a young attorney in New York he had found hard and
discouraging For two years he had trodden it and scarcely earned enough
to keep himself alive Now he had decided or practically decided to
give up the attempt select some small town or village and try his luck
there East Wellmouth was the one village he knew and remembered with
liking So to East Wellmouth he had come to as Captain Obed described
it take soundins and size up the fishin grounds

So there you are Captain he said in conclusion That is why I am
here

The captain nodded reflectively

Umyes he said I see I see Well well and youre figgerin on
bein a lawyer herein East Wellmouth

Mr Kendrick nodded also It may and probably will be pretty close
figuring at first he admitted but at least there will be no more
ciphers in the sum than there were in my Manhattan calculations
Honestly now Captain Bangs tell mewhat do you think of the idea

The captain seemed rather dubious

Humph he grunted Well I dont know John East Wellmouth aint a
very big place

I know that Of course I shouldnt hope to do much in East Wellmouth
alone But it seemed to me I might do as other country lawyers have
done have an officeor a deskin several other towns and be in those
towns on certain days in the week I think I should like to live in East
Wellmouth though It isnot to be sentimental but just truthfulthe
one place I remember where I was really happy And as I remember too
there used to be no lawyer there

Captain Obeds forehead puckered

Thats just it John he said There is a lawyer here now Good deal
of a lawyer tooif you ask HIM Names Heman Daniels You used to know
him as a boy didnt you

Kendrick nodded assent

I think I did he said Yes I remember him He was one of the big
boys when I was a little one and he used to bully us small chaps

Thats the feller He aint changed his habits so much neither But
hes our lawyer and I callate hes doin well

Is he Well thats encouraging at any rate And hes the only lawyer
you have Only one lawyer in a whole town Why in New York I couldnt
throw a cigar stump from my office window without running the risk of
hitting at least two and starting two damage suits

The captain chuckled

I presume likely you didnt throw many he observed That would be
expensive fun

It would was the prompt reply Cigars cost money

They jogged on for a few minutes in silence Then said Captain Obed

Well John what are you plannin to do first After we get into port
I mean

I scarcely know Look about perhaps Possibly try out a boardinghouse
and hunt for a prospective office By the way Captain you dont happen
to know of a good commodious two by four office that I could hire at a
two by four figure do you One not so far from the main street that
I should wear out an extravagant amount of shoe leather walking to and
from it

More reflection on the captains part Then he said

Well I dont know as I dont John Ill tell you Ive got a buildin
of my own Right abreast the postoffice Henry Cahoon has been usin
it for a barbershop But Henrys quit and its empty The locations
pretty good and the rentwell you and me wouldnt pull hair over the
rent question I guess

Probably not but I should insist on paying as much as your barber
friend did This isnt a charity proposition Im making you Captain
Bangs Oh let me ask this Has thiseroffice of yours got a good
front window

Front window What in time Yes I guess likely the front windows
all right But what does a lawyer want of a front window

To look out of About all a young lawyer does is look out of the
window Now about a boardingplace

Captain Obed had been waiting for this question

Ive got a boardinplace for you John he declared The office I
may not be so sartin about but the boardinplace I am There aint a
better one this side of Boston and I know it And the woman who keeps it
iswell you take my word for it shes all RIGHT

His passenger regarded him curiously

You seem very enthusiastic Captain he observed with a smile

Captain Bangs next remark was addressed to the horse He gruffly bade
the animal giddap and appeared a trifle confused

I am he admitted after a moment Youll be too when you see her

He described the High Cliff House and its owner Mr Kendrick asked the
terms for board and an average room When told he whistled

That isnt high he said For such a place as you say this is it is
very low But I am afraid it is too high for me Isnt there any other
establishment where they care for menand poor lawyers

Yes there is but you shant go to it not if I can stop you You
come right along with me now to the High Cliff and have dinner Yes you
will I aint had a chance to treat you for twenty year and Im goin
to buy you one square meal if I have to feed you by main strength Dont
you say another word There Theres east Wellmouth dead ahead of us
And theres the High Cliff House too Git dap Father of your Country
See Hes hungry too and he knows what hell get same as I do

They drove into the yard of Mrs Barnes property and Thankful
herself met them at the door Captain Obed introduced his passenger and
announced that the latter gentleman and he would dine there The lady
seemed glad to hear this but she seemed troubled too When she and the
captain were alone together she disclosed the cause of her trouble

Im afraid Im goin to lose my best boarder she said Mr Daniels
says hes afraid he must take his meals nearer his place of business
And if he does that hell get a room somewheres uptown Im awful
sorry Hes about the highest payin roomer I have and I did think he
was permanent Oh dear she added It does seem as if there was just
one thing after the other to worry me II dont seem to be makin both
ends meet the way I hoped Andand lookin out for everything myself
the way I have to do keeps me stirred up all the time I feel almost
sort of discouraged I know I shouldnt so soon of course Itsits
because Im tired today I guess likely

Yes I guess likely tis Tired I shouldnt wonder It aint any of my
affairs at all Mrs Barnes and I beg your pardon for sayin it but
if you dont have some good capable person to take some of the care and
managin of this place off your shoulders youll be down sick afore the
summers through

Thankful sighed and then smiled I know I need help the right kind of
help just as well as you do Capn Bangs she said But I know
too that I cant afford to pay for it so I must get along best I can
without it As for gettin sickwell I cant afford that either

At dinner John Kendrick met Mr Heman Daniels and Miss Timpson and Caleb
Hammond All three were evidently very curious concerning the business
which had brought the young man to East Wellmouth but their curiosity
was not satisfied Kendrick himself refused to notice hints and
insinuations and though he talked freely on most subjects would not
talk of his own affairs Captain Obed of course disclosed nothing of
the knowledge he had gained So the table talk dealt mainly with the
changes in the village since John was a boy there and of old times and
old residents long gone

Mr Daniels was very gracious and very affable He spoke largely of
cases intrusted to his care of responsibilities and trusts and if the
guest gained the idea that Mr Daniels was a very capable and prosperous
lawyer indeedif he gained such an idea and did not express it how
could Heman be expected to contradict

After dinnerKendrick informed his friend it was one of the best he had
ever eatenhe and the captain walked over to the village where they
spent the afternoon wandering about inspecting the exbarbershop and
discussing chances and possibilities The young man was still doubtful
of East Wellmouths promise of professional opportunities He should
like to live there he said and he might decide to do so but as yet
he had not so decided He seemed more pessimistic than during the drive
down from the station Captain Obed however and oddly enough was much
more optimistic than he had been at first

I dont know John he said but I aint sure you couldnt make
good and pretty good too by settlin here This section needs a good
lawyer

Another good lawyer you mean Daniels is here remember Judging by his
remarks this noon he is very much here

Umyes I know If you take his remarks at the value he marks em with
hes the whole bank and a safedeposit vault hove in But I wouldnt
wonder if those remarks was subject to a discount Anyhow I know mighty
well theres a lot of folks in this towngood substantial folks
toowho dont like him They hire him once in a while because there
aint another lawyer short of Trumet and thats quite a ways But maybe
theyd be mighty glad to shift if there was a chance right at hand
Dont you strike the colors yet awhile Think it over first

He insisted upon Kendricks returning to the High Cliff House that
night I want Mrs Barnes to show you the room shes got vacant he
said Aint no harm lookin at a brindle calf as the feller said you
dont have to buy the critter unless you want to

So Mr Kendrick inspected the rooms and expressed himself as delighted
with them

Theyre all right in every respect Captain he declared And the
food is more than that But the pricealthough its surprisingly low
considering the value offeredis too steep for me Im afraid if
I should locate here for a trial trip I couldnt afford to be
comfortable and I shouldnt expect to

Captain Bangs remained to take supper with his friend The meal
over they and the rest of the boarders were seated in the big
livingroomonce Captain Abners best parlorwhen there came from
outside the rattle of wheels and the voice of Winnie S shouting Whoa
to General Jackson

Thankful who had been in the kitchen superintending Imogene who was
learning rapidly came hurrying to the front door The group in the
parlor heard her utter an exclamation an exclamation of surprise and
delight There were other exclamations also in a feminine voice
and the sounds of affectionate greetings Then Mrs Barnes her face
beaming ushered into the livingroom a young woman And this young
woman was her cousin Emily Howes

Captain Obed rose to greet her

Well I swan to man Miss Howes he cried This IS a surprise I
didnt know you was due for a vyage in this latitude

Thankful laughed Neither did I she declared Its as big a surprise
to me as it is to you Capn She didnt write me a word

Emily laughed

Of course I didnt Auntie she said I wanted to surprise you But
youre glad to see me arent you

GLAD I dont believe I was ever so glad to see anybody in MY life

Were all glad to see you Miss Howes announced the captain Come
down to make us a little visit hey

Oh more than a little one You cant escape so easily I am going to
stay all summer at least perhaps longer There Aunt Thankful what do
you think of that




CHAPTER VIII


What Thankful thought of it was evidenced by the manner in which she
received the news She did not say much then but the expression of
relief and delight upon her face was indication sufficient She did
ask a number of questions Why had Emily come then so long before her
school closed How was it that she could leave her teaching Why hadnt
she written And many others

Miss Howes answered the questions one after the other She had come in
May because she found that she could come

I meant to come the very first moment it was possible for me to do so
she said I have been more interested in this new project of yours
Auntie than anything else in the world You knew that I told you
so before I left and I have written it many times since I came now
becausewell becauseyou mustnt be alarmed Auntie there is nothing
to be frightened aboutbut the school committee seemed to feel that I
needed a change and rest They seemed to think that I was not as well as
I should be that I was tired was wearing myself out that is the way
they expressed it It was absurd of course I am perfectly well But
when they came to me and told me that they had decided to give me a
vacation with pay until next fall and even longer if I felt that I
needed it you may be sure I didnt refuse their kind offer I thanked
them and said yes before they could have changed their minds even if
they had wished to They said I should go into the country That was
just where I wanted to go and so here I am IN the country Arent you
glad

Glad Dont talk But Emily if you aint well dont you think

I am well Dont say another word about that And Oh the things I
mean to do to help you Aunt Thankful

Help me Indeed you wont Youll rest and get strong again thats
what youll do I dont need any help

Oh yes you do I know it

How do you know

For just an instant Emily glanced at Captain Bangs The captains face
expressed alarm and embarrassment He was standing where Mrs Barnes
could not see him and he shook his head warningly Miss Howes eyes
twinkled but she did not smile

Oh I knew she repeated

But HOW did you know I never wrote you such a thing sartin

Of course you didnt But I knew becausewell just because Everyone
who takes boarders needs help Its aits a chronic condition Now
Auntie dont you think you could find some supper for me Not much
but just a little For an invalid ordered to the country I am awfully
hungry

That was enough for Thankful She seized her cousin by the arm and
hurried her into the diningroom A few moments later she reappeared to
order Miss Howes trunk carried upstairs to the blue room

Youll have to excuse me folks she said addressing her guests
I know I didnt introduce you to Emily I was so flustered andand
tickled to see her that I forgot everything manners and all Soons
shes had a bite to eat Ill try to make up Youll forgive me wont
you

When she had gone Captain Obed was bombarded with questions Who was the
young lady Where did she come from If she was only a cousin why did
she call Mrs Barnes Auntie And many others

Captain Obed answered as best he could

Shes real pretty isnt she affirmed Miss Timpson I dont know
when Ive seen a prettier woman Such eyes And such hair Ah hum
When I was her age folks used to tell me I had real wonderful hair You
remember that dont you Mr Hammond

Mr Hammond chuckled I remember lots of things he observed
diplomatically

You think shes pretty dont you Mr Daniels persisted Miss
Timpson

East Wellmouths legal light bowed assent Aahema very striking
young lady he said with dignity He had scarcely taken his eyes from
the newcomer while she was in the room John Kendrick said nothing

When Emily and Thankful returned to the livingroom there were
introductions and handshakings And following these a general
conversation lasting until ten oclock Then Miss Howes excused herself
saying that she was a bit tired bade them all good night and went to
her room

Captain Obed left soon afterward

Well John he said to his friend as they stood together on the front
step what do you think of this for a boardinhouse All I prophesied
aint it

Kendrick nodded All that and more he answered emphatically

Like Mrs Barnes dont you

Very much No one could help liking her

Umhm Well I told you that too And her niececousin I meanis
just as nice as she is Youll like her too when you know her   
Eh

I didnt speak Captain

Oh didnt you Well its high time for me to be headin for home
Hannahll be soundin the foghorn for me pretty soon Shell think IVE
been tagged by Abbie Larkin if I dont hurry up and report See you in
the mornin John Good night

The next forenoon he was on hand bright and early and he and Kendrick
went over to the village on another tour of inspection Captain Obed was
extremely curious to know whether or not his friend had made up his
mind to remain in East Wellmouth but as the young man himself did not
volunteer the information the captain asked no questions They walked
up and down the main road until dinner time John said very little and
was evidently thinking hard Just before twelve Captain Bangs did ask a
question his first one

Well John he said looking up at the clock in the steeple of the
Methodist Church its about time for us to be thinkin about takin in
cargo Where shall we eat this noon At the High Cliff again or do you
want to tackle Darius Holts Course you understand Im game for most
anything if you say so and most anythings what were liable to get
at that Holt shebang I dont want you to think Ive got any personal
grudge When it comes to that Imho howell Im a good deal in the
frame of mind Kenelm Parker was at the revival meetin some year ago
Kenelm just happened in and took one of the back seats The ministerhe
was a stranger in townwas walkin up and down the aisles tryin to
influence the mourners to come forward He crept up on Kenelm from
behind when he want expected and says he Brother he says do
you love the Lord Kenelm was some took by surprise and his wits was
in the next county I callate Whywhy he stammers I aint got
nothin AGIN Him Ho ho Thats the way I feel about Darius Holt
I dont love his hotel but I aint got nothin agin him What do you
say

Kendrick hesitated

The Holt board is cheaper isnt it he asked

Yup It costs less and its wuth it

Humph Wellwell I guess we may as well go back to the High Cliff
House

Captain Obed was much surprised but he said nothing

At dinner there was a sprightly air of cheerfulness and desire to please
among the boarders Everyone talked a good deal and most of the remarks
were addressed to Miss Howes who sat at the foot of the table opposite
her cousin Thankful noticed the change and marveled at it Dinners had
hitherto been rather hurried and silent affairs Miss Timpson usually
rushed through the meal in order to get back to her school Mr Daniels
habit was to fidget when Imogene delayed serving a course to look at
his watch and hint concerning important legal business which needed
prompt attention Caleb Hammonds conversation too often was confined
to a range bordered by rheumatism on the one hand and bronchitis on the
other

Now all this was changed No one seemed in a hurry no one appeared
to care what the time might be and no one grumbled Mr Daniels was
particularly affable and gracious he even condescended to joke He was
wearing his best and newest suit and his tie was carefully arranged
Emily was in high spirits laughed at the jokes whether they were new
or old and seemed to be very happy She had been for a walk along the
bluff and the sea breeze had crimsoned her cheeks and blown her hair
about She apologized for the disarrangement of the hair but even
Miss Timpsonher own tresses as smooth as the back of a haircloth
sofadeclared the effect to be real becomin Heman Daniels who
being a bachelor was reported to be very particular in such matters
heartily concurred in this statement Mr Hammond said it reminded him
some of Laviny Marthys hair Laviny Marthy was my wife that was he
added by way of explanation John Kendrick said very little in fact
he was noticeably silent during dinner Miss Timpson said afterward
That Mr Kendrick isnt much of a talker is he I guess hes what they
call a good listener for he seemed to be real interested especially
when Miss Howes was talkin Hed look at her and look at her and time
and time again I thought he was goin to say somethin but he didnt

He was not talkative when alone with Captain Obed that afternoon They
paid one more visit to the building opposite the postoffice and while
there he asked a few questions concerning the rent The figure named by
the captain was a low one and John seemed to think it too low Im not
asking charity he declared At least you might charge me enough to
pay for the paint I may rub off when I open the door

But Captain Obed obstinately refused to raise his figure Ive charged
enough to risk what paint there is he announced If I charged more
Id feel as if I had to paint fresh and I dont want to do that Whats
the matter with you John Want to heave your money away do you Better
keep the odd change to buy cigars You can heave them away if you want
toand you wont be liable to hit many lawyers neither

At supper time as they stood by the gate of the High Cliff House the
captain who was to eat at his regular boardingplace the Parkers
that evening ventured to ask the question he had been so anxious to
ask

Well John he began

Well Captain

Have youhave you made up your mind yet

Kendrick turned over with his foot a stone in the path

I he paused and turned the stone back again Then he drew a long
breath I must make it up he said and I can do it as well now as a
week later I suppose Wherever I go there will be a risk a big risk
Captain Bangs Ill take that risk here If you are willing to let
me have that office of yours for six months at the figure you have
namedand I think you are crazy to do itI will send for my trunk and
my furniture and begin tolook out of the window

Captain Obed was delighted Shake John he exclaimed Im tickled
to death And Ill tell you this If you cant get a client no other way
IllIll break into the meetinhouse and steal a pew or somethin
Then you can defend me Eh    And now what about a place for you to
eat and sleep he added after a moment

The young man seemed to find the question as hard to answer as the
other

I like it here he admitted I like it very much indeed But I must
economize and the few hundred dollars I have scraped together wont

He was interrupted Emily Howes appeared at the corner of the house
behind them

Supper is ready she called cheerfully

Both men turned to look at her She was bareheaded and the western sun
made her profile a dainty silhouette a silhouette framed in the spun
gold of her hair

Johns comin Miss Emily answered the captain Hell be right
there

Emily waved her hand and hurried back to the diningroom door Mr
Kendrick kicked the stone into the grass

I think I may as well remain here for the present at least he said
After all there is such a thing as being too economical A chap cant
always make a martyr of himself even if he knows he should

The next morning Mrs Barnes over at the village on a marketing
expedition met Captain Bangs on his way to the postoffice

Oh Capn she said Ive got somethin to tell you Taint bad news
this time its good Mr Heman Daniels has changed his mind Hes goin
to keep his room and board with me just as hes been doin Isnt that
splendid

The sewing circles and the club and the noon and evening groups at the
postoffice had two new subjects for verbal dissection during the next
fortnight This was in its way a sort of special Providence for
this was the dull season when there were no more wrecks alongshore or
schooners aground on the bars and the boarders and cottagers from the
cities had not yet come to East Wellmouth Also the opening of the High
Cliff House was getting to be a wornout topic So Emily Howes her
appearance and behavior and John Kendrick HIS behavior and his
astonishing recklessness in attempting to wrest a portion of the county
law practice from Heman Daniels were welcomed as dispensations and
discussed with gusto

Emily came through the gossip mill ground fine but with surprisingly
little chaff She was pretty as a picture all the males agreed
upon that point And even the females admitted that she was kind of
goodlookin although Hannah Parkers diagnosis that she was declined
to be consumptic and Mrs Larkins that she was older than she made
out to be had some adherents All agreed however that she knew how
to run a boardinghouse and that she was destined to be the salvation
of Thankful Barnes venture at the Capn Abner place

Certainly she did prove herself to possess marked ability as a business
manager Quietly and without undue assertion she reorganized the
affairs of the High Cliff House No one detected any difference in
the quality of the meals served there in their variety or ample
sufficiency But little by little she took upon herself the buying of
supplies the regulation of accounts the prompt payment of bills and
the equally prompt collection of board and room rent Thankful found the
cares upon her shoulders less and less heavy and she was more free to
do what she was so capable of doing that is superintend the cooking
and the housekeeping

But Thankful herself was puzzled

I dont understand it she said Ive always had to look out for
myself and others too There aint been a minute since I can remember
that I aint had somebody dependent upon me I callated I could run a
boardinhouse if I couldnt do anything else But Im just as sure as I
am that Im alive that if you hadnt come when you did Id have run this
one into the ground and myself into the poorhouse I dont understand
it

Emily smiled and put her arm about her cousins waist Oh no you
wouldnt Auntie she said It wasnt as bad as that You needed help
that was all And you are too generous and kindhearted You were always
fearful that your boarders might not be satisfied I have been teaching
bookkeeping and accounting you see and besides I have lived in a
family where the principal struggle was to satisfy the butcher and the
baker and the candlestick maker This is real fun compared to that

Thankful shook her head

I know she said you always talk that way Emily But Im afraid
youll make yourself sick You come down here purpose for your health
you know

Emily laughed and patted Mrs Barnes plump shoulder

Health she repeated Why I have never been as well since I can
remember I couldnt be sick here in this wonderful place if I tried
Do you think I look ill    Oh Mr Daniels addressing the lawyer
who had just entered the diningroom I want your opinion as aa
specialist Auntie is afraid I am ill Dont you think I look about as
well as anyone could look

Heman bowed If my poor opinion is worth anything he observed I
should say that to find fault with your appearance Miss Howes would
be like venturing toerpaint the lily as the saying is I might say
more butahemperhaps I had better not

Judging by the young ladys expression he had said quite enough already

Idiot she exclaimed after he had left the room I ask him a
sensible question and he thinks it necessary to answer with a silly
compliment Thought I was fishing for one probably Why will men be
such foolssome men

Mr Daniels opinion concerning his professional rival was asked a good
many times during that first fortnight He treated the subject as he
did the rival with condescending toleration It was quite plain that
he considered his own position too secure to be shaken In fact his
feeling toward John Kendrick seemed to be a sort of kindly pity

He appears to be a very wellmeaning young man he said in reply to
one of the questions Rash of course very young men are likely to be
rashand perhaps more hopeful than some of us older andahemwiser
persons might be under the same circumstances But he is wellmeaning
and persevering I have no doubt he will manage to pick up a few crumbs
here and there I may be able to throw a few in his way There are
always casesahwhich I cantor dont wish toaccept

When this remark was repeated to Captain Obed the latter sniffed

Humph he observed I dont know what they are I never see a case
Heman wouldnt accept if there was as much as seventyfive cents in
it If bananas was a nickel a bunch the only part hed throw in anybody
elses way would be the skins

John himself did not seem to mind or care what Mr Daniels or anyone
else said He wrote a letter to New York and in the course of time
a secondhand desk a few chairs and half a dozen cases of law books
arrived by freight and were installed in the exbarbershop The local
signpainter perpetrated a sign with John Kendrick Attorneyatlaw
upon it in gilt letters and the looking out of the window really
began

And that was about all that did begin for days and days Each morning or
afternoon Sundays excepted Captain Bangs would drop in at the office
and find no one there no one but the tenant that is The latter
seated behind the desk with a big sheepskinbound volume spread open
upon it was always glad to see his visitor Their conversations were
characteristic

Hello John the captain would begin How are the clients comin

Dont know Captain None of them has as yet got near enough so that I
could see how he comes

Humph I want to know Mr John D Jacob Vanderbilt aint cruised
in from Newport to put his affairs in your hands Sho Hes pretty
shortsighted aint he

Very Hes losing valuable time

Well I expected better things of him I must say Aint gettin
discouraged are you John

No indeed If there was much discouragement in my makeup I should
have stopped before I began How is the fish business Captain

Well taint what it ought to be this season of the year Say John
couldnt you subpoena a school of mackerel for me Serve an order of
the court on them to come into my weirs and answer for their sins or
somethin like that Id be willin to pay you a fairly good fee

On one occasion the visitor asked his friend what he found to do all the
long days Dont study law ALL the time do you John he queried

Kendrick shook his head No he answered gravely Between studies I
enjoy the view Magnificent view from this window dont you think

Captain Obed inspected the view The principal feature in the
landscape was Dr Jamesons cow pastured in the vacant lot between the
doctors home and the postoffice

Very fine cow that commented the lawyer An inspiring creature
I spend hours looking at that cow She is a comfort to my philosophic
soul

The captain observed that he wanted to know

Yes continued Kendrick She is happy you can see that she is happy
Now why

Cause shes eatin grass declared Captain Obed promptly

Thats it Good for you You have a philosophic soul yourself Captain
She is happy because she has nothing to do but eat and there is plenty
to eat Thats my case exactly I have nothing to do except eat and
at Mrs Barnes boardinghouse there is always enough and more than
enough to eat The cow is happy and I ought to be I suppose If MY
food was furnished free of cost I should be I presume

Kenelm Parker heard a conversation like the foregoing on one occasion
and left the office rubbing his forehead

Theres two lunatics in that place he told the postmaster And if
Id stayed there much longer and listened to their ravins thered have
been another one

Kenelm seemed unusually contented and happy in his capacity as
manofallwork at the High Cliff House Possibly the fact that there
was so very little real work to do may have helped to keep him in this
frame of mind He had always the appearance of being very busy a rake
or a hoe or the kindling hatchet were seldom out of reach of his hand
He talked a great deal about being beat out and of the care and
responsibility which were his Most of these remarks were addressed to
Imogene to whom he had apparently taken a great fancy

Imogene was divided in her feelings toward Mr Parker

Hes an awful interestin talker she confided to Emily Every time
he comes into this kitchen I have to watch out or hell stay and talk
till noontime And yet if I want to get him to do somethin or other
he is always chock full of business that cant wait a minute I like to
hear him talkhes got ideas on most every kind of thingbut I have
to work myself

Do you mean that he doesnt work asked Emily

I dont know whether he does or not I cant make out If he dont
hes an awful good makebelieve thats all Ive got to say One time
I caught him back of the woodpile sound asleep but he was hanging onto
the axe just the same Said he set up half the night before worryin
for fear he mightnt be able to get through his next days work and the
want of rest had been too much for him Then he started in to tell me
about his home life and I listened for ten minutes before I come to
enough to get back to the house

Do you think he is lazy Imogene

I dont know He says he never had no chance and it might be thats so
He says the ambitions been pretty well drove out of him and I guess it
has I should think twould be The way that sister of his nags at him
all the time is enough to drive out thethe measles

Imogene and Hannah Parker as Captain Obed said rubbed each other the
wrong way Hannah was continually calling to see her brother
probably to make sure that he was there and not in the dangerous Larkin
neighborhood Imogene resented these visitsusin up Mrs Thankfuls
time she said they wereand she and Hannah had some amusing clashes
Miss Parker was inclined to patronize the girl from the Orphans Home
and Imogene objected

Well observed Hannah on one occasion I presume likely you find it
nice to be down here where folks are folks and not just inmates It
must be dreadful to be an inmate

Imogene sniffed Theres all kinds of inmates she said same as
theres all kinds of folks Fars that goes theres some folks couldnt
be an inmate if they wanted to They wouldnt be let in

Oh is that so Judgin by what Ive seen I shouldnt have thought them
that run such places was very particular Wheres Kenelm

I dont know Hes to work I suppose Thats what hes hired for they
tell me

Oh indeed Well with emphasis he doesnt have to work unless
he wants to My brother has money of his own enough to subside
on comftably if he wanted to do it His comin here is just to
accommodate Mrs Barnes thats all Where is he

Last I saw of him he was accommodatin the horse stall He may be
uptown by this time for all I know

Uptown in alarm What would he be uptown for He aint got any
business there has he

Search ME Good many guysfolks I meanseem to be always hangin
round where they havent business Well Ive got some of my own and I
guess Id better attend to it Good mornin maam

Miss Howes cautioned Imogene against arousing the Parkers enmity

Lordy I mean mercy sakes maam exclaimed Imogene you neednt be
afraid so far as Kenelms concerned I do boss him around some when I
think its needful but it aint my bossin that worries him its that
Hannah womans He says shes at him all the time Dont give him the
peace of his life he says Hes a misunderstood man he tells me Maybe
he is there are such you know Ive read about em in stories

Emily smiled Well she said I wouldnt drive him too hard if I
were you Imogene He isnt the hardest worker in the world but he does
do some work and men who can be hired to work about a place in summer
are scarce here in East Wellmouth You must be patient with him

Lorland sakes I am But he does make me cross Hed be settin in my
kitchen every evenin if Id let him Dont seem to want to go home I
dont knows I blame him for that You think I ought to let him set I
suppose Miss Howes

Why yes if he doesnt annoy you too much We must keep him contented
You must sacrifice your own feelings to help Aunt Thankful You would be
willing to make some sacrifice for her wouldnt you

You bet your life I would Shes the best woman on earth Mrs Barnes
is Id do anything for her sacrifice my head if that was worth five
cents to anybody All right he can set if he wants to II suppose
I might improve his mind hey maam By readin to him I mean Mrs
Thankful shes been givin me books to improve my mind perhaps theyd
improve his if I read em out loud to him His sister probly wont like
it but I dont care You couldnt improve HER mind she aint got any
It all run off the end of her tongue long ago

By the Fourth of July the High Cliff House was filled with boarders
Every room was taken even the little back bedroom and the big room
adjoining it These were taken by a young couple from Worcester and if
they heard any unusual noises in their apartment they did not mention
them Thankfuls dread of that little room had entirely disappeared
She was now thoroughly convinced that her imagination and the storm were
responsible for the spooks

John Kendrick continued to sleep and eat at the new boardinghouse He
was a general favorite there although rather silent and disinclined to
take an active part in the conversation at table He talked more with
Emily Howes than with anyone and she and he were becoming very friendly
Emily Thankful and Captain Obed Bangs were the only real friends the
young man had he might have had more but he did not seem to care for
them With these three however and particularly with Emily he was
even confidential speaking of his professional affairs and prospects
subjects which he never mentioned to others

Thesethe prospectswere brighter than at first He had accepted
one case and refused another The refusal came as a surprise to East
Wellmouth and caused much comment Mr Chris Badger was a passenger on
the train from Boston and that train ran off the track at Buzzards
Bay No one was seriously hurt except Mr Badger The latter gentleman
purchased a pair of crutches and limped about on them proclaiming
himself a cripple for life He and Heman Daniels had had a disagreement
over a business matter so Chris took his damage suit against the
railroad to John Kendrick And John refused it

Captain Obed much disturbed questioned his friend

Land of love John he said Here youve been roostin here lookin
out of this window and prayin for a job to come along Now one does
come along and you turn it down Why

Kendrick laughed Im cursed with a strong sense of contrast Captain
he replied Those crutches are too straight for me

The captain stared Straight he repeated All crutches are straight
aint they

Possibly but some cripples are crooked

So it was to Mr Daniels after all that the damage suit came and
Heman brought about a threehundreddollar settlement Most of East
Wellmouth pronounced Kendrick too pesky particular but in some
quarters and these not by any means the least influential his attitude
gained approval and respect This feeling was strengthened by his taking
Edgar Wingates suit against that same railroad Edgars woodlot was
set on fire by sparks from the locomotive and John forced payment and
liberal payment for the damage Other cases small ones began to
come his way Lawyer Daniels had enemies in the community who had been
waiting to take their legal affairs elsewhere

Heman still professed entire indifference but he no longer patronized
his rival John had a quiet way of squelching such patronage and of
turning the laugh which was annoying to a person lacking a sense of
humor And then too it was quite evident that Emily Howes liking for
the younger man displeased Daniels greatly Heman liked Emily seemed to
like her very much indeed On one or two occasions he had taken her to
ride behind his fast horse and he often brought bouquets and fruit
given me by my clients and friends he explained One cant refuse
little gifts like that but it is a comfort to a bachelor like me to
be able to hand them onhand them onyes

The first of August brought a new sensation and a new resident to East
Wellmouth The big Colfax estate was sold and the buyer was no less a
personage than E Holliday Kendrick John Kendricks aristocratic Fifth
Avenue cousin His coming was as great a surprise to John as to the rest
of the community but he seemed much less excited over it The purchase
was quietly completed and one pleasant morning the great E Holliday
himself appeared in East Wellmouth accompanied by a wife and child two
motor cars and six servants

Captain Obed Bangs who had been spending a week in Orham on business
connected with his fish weirs returned to find the village chanting
the praises of the new arrival Somehow or other E Holliday had managed
already to convey the impression that he was the most important person
in creation The captain happening in at the High Cliff House after
supper found the group in the livingroom discussing the allimportant
topic Most of the city boarders were out enjoying a marshmallow toast
about a bonfire on the beach but the regulars were present

Wheres Mrs Thankful was Captain Obeds first question

Shes in the kitchen I think replied John Shall I call her

Oh no no It aint particular I justjust wondered where she was
thats all I wouldnt trouble her on no account

John smiled He seemed quietly amused about something He regarded his
friend who after a glance in his direction was staring at the lamp on
the table and said

Im sure it would be no trouble Captain Better let me tell her you
are here

Captain Obed was saved the embarrassment of further protestations by the
entrance of Thankful herself Emily accompanied her The captain shook
hands with Mrs Barnes and her cousin and hastened to announce that he
heard big news down street and had run over to find out how much truth
there was in it

Couldnt scurcely believe it myself he declared John here never
said a word about his hightoned relation comin to East Wellmouth Had
you any idea he was comin John

John shook his head

No he said The last time I saw him in New York which was two
years or more ago he did say something about being on the lookout for
a summer residence But he did not mention East Wellmouth nor did I
I remember hearing that he and the late Mr Colfax were quite friendly
associated in business affairs I believe Probably that accounts for
his being here

Set down everybody urged Thankful Im willin to set down myself
I can tell you Been on my feet most of the day What sort of a person
is this relation of yours Mr Kendrick He ought to be all right if
theres anything in family connections

Heman Daniels answered the question He spoke with authority

Mr Holliday is a fine gentleman he announced emphatically Ive
seen him two or three times since he came Hes a millionaire but it
doesnt make him pompous or standoffish He and I spokeerconversed
together as friendly and easy as if we had known each other all our
lives He is very much interested in East Wellmouth He tells me that
if the place keeps on suiting him as it has so far he intends making
it his permanent home Of course he wont stay here ALL the yearthe
family have a house in Florida and one in New York I believebut he
will call East Wellmouth his real home and his interests will center
here

There was a general expression of satisfaction Miss Timpson declared
that it was real lovely of Mr Holliday Kendrick Caleb Hammond
announced that he always callated there was a boom coming for the town
Had said so more times than he could count Folksll tell you I said
it too he proclaimed stoutly Theyll bear me out in it if you ask
em

Im glad were goin to have such nice neighbors said Thankful Its
always worried me a little wonderin who that Colfax place might be sold
to I didnt know but somebody might get it with the notion of startin
another hotel

Hannah Parker aint opened her mouth to talk of anything else since
I got back said Captain Bangs And its been open most of the time
too She says Johns rich relations locatin here is a dissipation of
Providence if you know what that is

John smiled but he said nothing Emily was silent also she was
regarding the young man intently

Yes sir continued Mr Daniels evidently pleased at the approval
with which his statement had been met Yes sir Mr E Holliday
Kendrick is destined to be a great acquisition to this town mark my
words He tells me he shall hire no one to do his work except East
Wellmouth people And there will be a lot of work to be done if he
carries out his plans He intends building an addition to his house and
enlarging his estate

Thankful interrupted

Enlargin it she repeated Mercy sakes What for I should think
twas large enough now

Heman smiled tolerantly To usthe ordinaryercitizens it might
appear so he observed But theerNew York ideas is broader
than the average Cape Codders if youll excuse me Mrs Barnes Mr
Kendrick has begun to spend money here already and he will doubtless
spend more He contemplates public improvements as well as private He
asked me what sort of spirit there was in our community Ahem

He paused apparently to let the importance of the announcement sink in
It sank or seemed to Mr Hammond however was somewhat puzzled

Now what do you callate he meant by that he queried

John Kendrick answered He and Emily had exchanged smiles Neither of
them seemed as deeply impressed with the Daniels proclamation as the
others of the group

Perhaps he wanted to buy a drink suggested John gravely

Miss Timpson was shocked her expression showed it Caleb Hammond did
not seem to know whether to be shocked or not the Hammond appreciation
of a joke generally arrived on a later train Mrs Barnes and Captain
Obed laughed but not too heartily

Mr Daniels did not laugh The frivolous interruption evidently jarred
him

I scarcely imagine that to be the reason he said drily If Mr E
Holliday Kendrick does indulge I guess likelythat is I presume he
would not find it necessary to buy hiserbeverages here He meant
public spirit of course He asked me who our leading men were

Who were theythe others I mean asked John

Emily rubbed away a smile with her handkerchief Heman noticed her
action and his color brightened

They WERE public he said rather sharply They were men of
standinglong standing in the community Prominent and prosperous
citizens who have lived here long enough for East Wellmouth to know
themand respect them

This was a shot in the bulls eye Miss Timpson evidently thought so
for she nodded approval Daniels continued

They were men of known worth he went on Practical citizens whose
past as well as present is known Your cousinI believe he is your
cousin Kendrick although he did not mention the relationshipwas
grateful to me for giving him their names He is a practical man
himself

John nodded He must be he admitted No one but a practical man
could get all that advice free from a lawyer

Captain Obed laughed aloud

Thats a good one he declared Lawyers aint in the habit of GIVIN
much cordin to all accounts How about it Heman

Mr Daniels ignored the question and the questioner He rose to his
feet

There are SOME lawyers he observed crisply whose advice is not
askedto any great extent II think I will join the group on the
beach Its a beautiful evening Wont you accompany me Miss Howes

Emily declined the invitation No thank you Mr Daniels she said
I am rather tired and I think I wont go out tonight By the way Mr
Kendrick she added was the great man asking your advice also I
happened to see him go into your office yesterday

Everyone was surprisedeveryone except the speaker and the person
addressed that isbut Hemans surprise was most manifest His hand was
on the knob of the door but now he turned

In HIS office he repeated Kendrick was he in to see YOU

John bowed assent Yes he said He seems to be contemplating
retaining a sort ofof resident attorney to look after his local
affairs I mentioned your name Daniels

Mr Daniels went out The door banged behind him

A half hour later after Mr Hammond also had gone to join the
marshmallow toasters and Miss Timpson had retired to her room John told
the others the story Mr E Holliday Kendrick HAD called upon him at
his office and he did contemplate engaging a resident lawyer There were
likely to be many of what he termed minor details connected with the
transfer of the Colfax estate to him and the purchases which he meant
to make later on and an attorney at his beck and call would be a great
convenience Not this only he had actually offered his young cousin
the position had offered to engage him and to pay him several hundred
dollars as a retaining fee

He told his hearers so much and then he stopped Emily who had seemed
much interested waited a moment and then begged him to continue

Well she said Why dont you tell us the rest We are all waiting to
congratulate you You accepted of course

John shook his head Why no he replied I didnt accept exactly
I did say I would think it over but Iwell Im not sure that I shall
accept

Here was the unexpected His hearers looked at each other in amazement

You wont accept cried Thankful Why Mr Kendrick

Wont accept shouted Captain Obed What on earth Why John
Kendrick whats the matter with you Aint you been settin in that
office of yours waitin and waitin for somethin worth while to come
along And now a really big chance does come and you say you dont know
as youll take it What kind of talks that Id like to know

John smiled Miss Howes who seemed as much surprised as the others did
not smile

Why wont you take it demanded the captain

Oh I dont know The proposition doesnt appeal to me as strongly as
it should perhaps Cousin Holliday and I ARE cousins but wewell we
differ in other ways besides the size of our incomes When I was in New
York I went to him at one time I wasI neededwell I went to him He
consented to see me and he listened to what I had to say but he was
not too cordial He didnt ask me to call again Now he seems changed
I admit Remembers perfectly well that I am his fathers brothers
only child and all that and out of the kindness of his heart offers me
employment Butbut I dont know

No one spoke for a moment Then Emily broke the silence

You dont know she repeated rather sharply Why not may I ask

Oh I dont thats all For one thing there is just a little too much
condescension in my dear cousins manner I may be a yellow dog but
I dont like to sit up and beg when my master threatens to throw me a
bone Perhaps Im particular as to who that master may be

Again it was Emily who spoke

Perhaps you areTOO particular she said Can you afford to be so
particular

Probably not But you see there is another thing There is a question
of professional ethics involved If I take that retainer I am bound in
honor to undertake any case Cousin Holliday may give me Andand Im
not sure I should care to do that You know how I feel about a
lawyers duty to his client and his duty to himself There are certain
questions

She interrupted

I think there are too many questions she said I lose patience with
you sometimes Often and often I have known of your refusing cases which
other lawyers have taken and won

Meaning Brother Daniels He asked it with a smile but with some
sarcasm in his tone Both he and Miss Rowes seemed to have forgotten
that the captain and Thankful were present

Why yes Mr Daniels has accepted cases which you have refused No one
thinks the less of him for it He will accept your cousins retainer if
you dont

I presume he will That would be the practical thing to do and he
prides himself on his practicality

Practicality is not altogether bad It is often necessary in this
practical world What case is Mr Kendrick likely to put in your hands
which you would hesitate to undertake

None that I know of But if he did I

You could refuse to take it

Why not easily I should have accepted his retainer and that
according to legal etiquette would make me honor bound to

She interrupted again Her patience was almost gone that was plain For
the matter of that so was Captain Obeds

Dont you think that you are a trifle too sensitive concerning honor
she asked And too suspicious besides I do Oh I am tired of your
scruples I dont like to see you letting success andand all the rest
of it pass you by when other men not so overscrupulous do succeed
Dont you care for success Or for money

John interrupted her He leaned forward and spoke deliberately but
firmly And he looked her straight in the face

I do he said I care for bothnowmore than I ever thought I could
care

And all at once the young lady seemed to remember that her cousin and
the captain were in the room She colored and when she spoke it was in
a different tone

Then she said it seems to me if I were you I should accept the
opportunities that came in my way Of course its not my affair I
shouldnt have presumed to advise She rose and moved toward the
door Good night Mr Kendrick she said Good night Captain Bangs
Auntie you will excuse me wont you I am rather tired tonight and

But once more Kendrick interrupted

One moment please Miss Howes he said earnestly Do I
understanddo you mean that you wish me to accept Cousin Hollidays
retainer

Emily paused

Why she answered after an instants hesitation II really dont
see why my wish one way or the other should be very strong Butbut as
a friend of yoursof course we are all your friends Mr Kendrickas
one of your friends Iwe naturally like to see you rise in your
profession

Then you advise me to accept

If my advice is worth anythingyes Good night

Next day when Captain Obed made his customary call at the
exbarbershop he ventured to ask the question uppermost in his mind

Have you decided yet John he asked

His friend looked at him

Meaningwhat he queried

Meaninyou know what I mean well enough Have you decided to take
your cousins offer

Ive done more than that Captain I have accepted the offer and the
retaining fee too

Captain Obed sprang forward and held out his hand

Bully for you John he shouted Thats the best thing you ever done
in your life NOW youve really started

Kendrick smiled Yes he admitted I have started Where I may finish
is another matter

CHAPTER IX


The August days were busy ones at the High Cliff House Every room was
filled and the tables in the diningroom well crowded Thankful told
Captain Bangs that she could not spare time even to look out of the
window And yet Emily and I are about the only ones who dont look
out she added Theres enough goin on to look at thats sartin

There was indeed Mr E Holliday Kendrick having taken possession of
his new estate immediately set about the improving and enlarging which
Mr Daniels had quoted him as contemplating Carpenters painters and
gardeners were at work daily The Kendrick motor cars and the Kendrick
servants were much in evidence along East Wellmouths main road What
had been done by the great man and his employees and what would be done
in the near future kept the gossips busy He was planning a new rose
gardenthe finest from Buzzards Bay down he had torn out the whole
broadside of the musicroom and was callatin to make it twice as
large as formerly he was to build a large conservatory on the knoll by
the stables Hannah Parker declared she could not see the need of this
Theres a tower onto the main buildin already she said pretty nigh
as high as a lighthouse I should think a body could see fur enough
from that tower without riggin up a conservatory Well Mrs Kendrick
neednt ask ME to go up in it I went to the top of the conservatory on
Scargo Hill one time and I was so dizzy in the head I thought sure Id
fall right over the railin

The High Cliff boardersMiss Timpson and Caleb Hammond
especiallyspent a great deal of time peering from the livingroom
windows and watching what they called the goins on at the Kendrick
estate Occasionally they caught a glimpse of E Holliday himself The
great man was inclined to greatness even in the physical meaning of
the word for he was tall and stout and dignified not to say pompous
Arrayed in white flannels he issued orders to his hirelings and the
hirelings obeyed him When one is monarch of the larger portion of all
he surveys it must be gratifying to feel that one looks the part E
Holliday looked it and apparently felt it

Thankful during this her most prosperous season was active from
morning until night When that night came she was ready for sleep ready
for more than she could afford to take Emily was invaluable as manager
and assistant and Captain Obed Bangs assisted and advised in every way
that he could The captain had come to be what Mrs Barnes called the
sheet anchor of the High Cliff House Whenever the advice of a man
or a mans help was needed it was to Captain Bangs that she turned And
Captain Obed was always only too glad to help Hannah Parker declared he
spent more time at the boarding house than he did at her home

If Emily Howes noticed how frequently the captain calledand it is
probable that she didshe said nothing about it John Kendrick must
have noticed it for occasionally when he and Captain Obed were alone
he made an irrelevant remark like the following

Captain he said on one occasion I think youre growing younger
every day

Who Me Go on John How you talk Im so old my timbers creak every
time I go up a flight of stairs Theyll be sendin me to the junk pile
pretty soon

I guess not Youre as young as I am every bit Not in years perhaps
but in spirit and energy And you surprise me too I didnt know you
were such a ladys man

Me A ladys man Tut tut Dont talk foolish If Ive cruised alone
all these years I callate thats proof enough of how much a ladys man
I am

Thats no proof You havent happened upon the right sort of consort
thats all Look at Brother Daniels he is a bachelor too but everyone
knows what a ladys man he is

Humph You aint comparin me to Heman Daniels are you

No No of course not I shouldnt dare Comparing any mortal with
Daniels would be heresy wouldnt it But you certainly are popular with
the fair sex Why even Imogene has fallen under the influence She says
Mrs Barnes thinks you are the finest man in the world

She does hey Well tartly she better mind her own affairs I
thought she rated Kenelm Parker about as high as anybody these days He
spends more time in that kitchen of hers

There there Captain Dont sidestep The fair Imogene may be
susceptible to Mr Parkers charms but that is probably because you
havent smiled upon her If you

Say look here John Kendrick If you keep on talkin loony in this way
Ill begin to heave out a few hints myself I may be as popular as you
say with Imogene andand the help but I know somebody else that is
catchin the same disease

Meaning Mr Daniels I suppose He is popular I admit

Is he Well you ought to know best Seems to me I can call to mind
somebody else that is fairly popularin some latitudes By the way
John you dont seem to be as popular with Heman as you was at first

Im sorry My accepting my cousins retainer may

Oh I didnt mean that What was you and Emily doin at Chris Badgers
store yesterday afternoon

Doing Yesterday Oh yes I did meet Miss Howes while I was on my way
to the office and I waited while she did a little marketing What in the
world

Nothin Furs that goes I dont think either of you knew you was IN
the world I passed right by and you didnt see me Heman saw you too
What was your marketinvegetables

I believe so Captain youre sidestepping again It was of you not
me I was speaking when

Yes I know Well Im speakin about you now Heman saw you buyin
them vegetables Tomatters want they

Perhaps so Have you been drinking What difference does it make
whether we bought tomatoes or potatoes

Didnt make noneto me But I bet Heman didnt like to see you two
buyin tomatters

For heavens sake why not

Oh cause he probably remembered same as I did what folks used to
call em in the old days

You HAVE been drinking What did they use to call them

Love apples replied Captain Obed and strode away chuckling John
watched him go He too laughed at first but his laugh broke off in
the middle and when he went into the house his expression was troubled
and serious

One remark of the captains was true enough John Kendricks popularity
with his professional rival was growing daily less The pair were
scrupulously polite to each other but they seldom spoke except when
others were present and Mr Daniels made it a point apparently to be
present whenever Miss Howes was in the room He continued to bring his
little offerings of fruit and flowers and his invitations for drives
and picnics and entertainments at the town hall were more frequent
Sometimes Emily accepted these invitations more often she refused them
John also occasionally invited her to drive with him or to play tennis
on his cousins courts and these invitations she treated as she did
Hemans refusing some and accepting others She treated the pair
with impartiality and yet Thankful was growing to believe there was a
difference Imogene outspoken expressed her own feelings in the matter
when she said

Miss Emily likes Mr Kendrick pretty well dont she maam

Thankful regarded her maidservant with disapproval

What makes you say that Imogene she demanded Of course she likes
him Why shouldnt she

She should maam And she does too And he likes her thats plain
enough

Imogene what are you hintin at Do you mean that my cousin is inin
love with Mr John Kendrick

Nom I dont say that not yet But theres signs that

Signs If you dont get those ridiculous storybook notions out of
your head I dont know what Ill do to you What do you know about folks
bein in love You aint in love I hope are you

Imogene hesitated No maam she replied I aint Butbut maybe I
might be if I wanted to

For mercy sakes The girls crazy You MIGHT beif you wanted to Who
with If youre thinkin of marryin anybody seems to me I ought to know
it Why you aint met moren a dozen young fellers in this town
and Ive taken good care to know who they were If youre thinkin of
fallin in loveor marryin

Imogene interrupted I aint she declared And anyhow maam
gettin married dont necessarily mean youre in love

It dont Well this beats all I ever

No maam it dont Sometimes its a persons duty to get married

Thankful gasped Duty she repeated You HAVE been readin more of
those books in spite of your promisin me you wouldnt

No maam I aint Honest I aint

Then what do you mean Imogene what man do you care enough for to make
you feel its youryour duty to marry him

No man at all declared Imogene promptly and decisively And that is
all she would say on the subject

Thankful repeated this astonishing conversation or part of it to
Emily The latter considered it a good joke That girl is a strange
creature she said and great fun You never can tell what she will
say or think She is very romantic and that nonsense about duty and
the rest of it undoubtedly is taken from some story she has read You
neednt worry Auntie Imogene worships you and she will never leave
youto be married or for any other reason

So Thankful did not worry about Imogene She had other worries those
connected with a houseful of boarders and these were quite sufficient
And now came another Kenelm Parker was threatening to leave her employ

The statement is not strictly true Kenelm himself never threatened
to do anything But another person did the threatening for him and that
person was his sister Hannah Parker for some unaccountable reason
seemed to be developing a marked prejudice against the High Cliff House
Her visits to the premises were not less frequent than formerly but
they were confined to the yard and stable she no longer called at the
house Her manner toward Emily and Thankful was cordial enough perhaps
but there was constraint in it and she asked a good many questions
concerning her brothers hours of labor what he did during the day and
the like

She acts awful queer seems to me said Thankful Not the way she did
at first at all In the beginnin I had to plan pretty well to keep her
from runnin in and spilin my whole mornin with her talk Now she
seems to be keepin out of my way What weve done to make her act so I
cant see and neither can Emily

Captain Bangs to whom this remark was addressed laughed

You aint done anything I guess he said It aint you shes down
on its your hired girl the Imogene one She seems to be more down on
that Imogene than a bow anchor on a mud flat They dont hitch horses
those two You see she tries to boss and condescend and Imogene gives
her as good as she sends Its got so that Hannah is actually scared of
that girl dont pretend to be of course calls her the inmate and
all sorts of names But she is scared of her and dont like her

Thankful was troubled Im sorry she said Imogene is independent
but shes an awful kindhearted girl I do hate trouble amongst
neighbors

Oh there wont be any trouble Hannahs jealous thats all the
troublejealous about Kenelm You see she wanted him to come here to
work sos she could have him under her thumb and run over and give him
orders every few minutes Imogene gives him orders too and he minds
she makes him Hannah dont like that cordin to her notion Kenelm
hadnt ought to have any skipper but her Its all right though Mrs
Barnes Its good for Kenelm and its good for Hannah Do em both good
I callate

But when Kenelm announced that he wasnt sure but that he should heave
up his job in a fortnight or so the situation became more serious

He mustnt leave declared Thankful August and early September
are the times when Ive got to have a man on the place and you say
yourself Captain Bangs that there isnt another man to be had just
now If he goes

Oh he wont go This is more of Hannahs talk shes put him up to
this leavin business Offer him another dollar a week if you have to
and Ill do some preachin to Hannah myself

When Thankful mentioned the matter to Imogene the latters comment was
puzzling but emphatic

Dont you fret maam she said He aint left yet

I know but he says

HE dont say it Its that sister of his does all the sayin And SHE
aint workin for you that I know of

Now Imogene we mustnt any of us interfere between Kenelm and his
sister She IS his sister you know

Yesm But she isnt his mother and his grandmother and his aunt and
all his relations And if she was twouldnt make no difference Hes
the one to say whether hes goin to leave or not

But he does say it That is he

He just says he callates He never said he was GOIN to do anything
not for years anyhow Its all right Mrs Thankful You just wait and
see If worst comes to worst Ive got a

She stopped short What have you got Imogene asked Mrs Barnes

Oh nothin maam Only you just wait

So Thankful waited and Kenelm perfectly aware of the situation and
backed by the counsel of his sister became daily more independent
He did only such work as he cared to do and his hours for arriving and
departing were irregular to say the least

On the last Thursday Friday and Saturday of August the Ostable County
Cattle Show and Fair was to be held at the county seat The annual
Cattle Show is a big event on the Cape and practically all of East
Wellmouth was planning to attend Most of the High Cliff boarders were
going to the Fair and Friday being the big day they were going
on Friday Imogene asked for a holiday on that day The request was
granted Then Kenelm announced that he and Hannah were callatin to
go Thankful was somewhat reluctant she felt that to be deprived of
the services of both her hired man and maid on the same day might be
troublesome But as the Parker announcement was more in the nature of an
ultimatum than a request she said yes under protest But when Captain
Obed appeared and invited her and John Kendrick and Emily Howes to go to
the Fair with him in a hired motor car she was more troubled than ever

Id like to go Capn she said Oh I WOULD like to go I havent
had a day off since this place opened and I never rode in an automobile
moren three times in my life But I cant do it You and Emily and John
can of course and you must but Ive got to stay here Some of the
boarders will be here for their meals and I cant leave the house
alone

Captain Obed uttered a dismayed protest

Sho he exclaimed Sho Thats too bad Why I counted more on your
goin thanHumph Youve just got to go thats all Cant Imogene look
after the house

She could if she was goin to be here but shes goin to the Fair
herself I promised her she could and I must keep my promise

Yes yes I presume likely you must But now Mrs Thankful

Im afraid there cant be any but Capn You and Mr Kendrick and
Emily go and Ill get my fun thinkin what a good time youll have

She was firm and at last the captain yielded But his keen
disappointment was plainly evident He said but little during his stay
at the boardinghouse and went home early glum and disconsolate At the
Parker domicile he found Kenelm and his sister in a heated argument

I dont care Hannah vowed Kenelm Im agoin to that Fair no
matter if I do have to go alone Didnt you tell me I was goin Didnt
you put me up to askin for the day off Didnt you

Never mind what I did I give in I had planned for you to go but that
was when I figgered on you and me goin together Now that Mr Hammond
has invited me to go along with him

Captain Obed interrupted Hello Hello he exclaimed Whats this
Has Caleb Hammond offered to go gallivantin off to the Ostable Cattle
Show along with you Hannah Well well Wondersll never cease Calebs
gettin gay in his old age aint he Humph therell be somethin else
for the postoffice gang to talk about first thing you know Hannah Im
surprised

Miss Parker colored and seemed embarrassed Her brother however voiced
his disgust

Surprised he repeated Huh Thats nuthin to what I am Im moren
surprisedIm paralyzed To think of that tightfisted old fool lettin
go of money enough to hire a horse and team and

Kenelm Hannahs voice quivered with indignation Kenelm Parker The
idea

Yes thats what I say the idea Heres an old critteryes he is
old too Hes so nigh seventy he dont dast look at the almanac for
fear hell find its past his birthday And hes always been so tight
with money that hed buy secondhand postage stamps if the Govment
wouldnt catch him And his wifes been dead a couple of hundred year
more or less and yet by thundermighty all to once he starts in

Kenelm Parker you stop this minute Im ashamed of you Mr Hammonds
a real nice respectable man As to his moneywell thats his
business anyhow and besides he aint hirin the horse and buggy hes
goin to borrow it off his nephew over to the Centre His askin me to
go is a real neighborly act

Huh If hes so plaguy neighborly why dont he ask me to go too Im
as nigh a neighbor as you be aint I

He dont ask you because the buggy wont hold but two and you know
it I should think youd be glad to have me save the expense of my fare
Winnie S would charge me fifty cents to take me to the depot and the
fare on the excursion train is

Now what kind of talks that I aint complainin cause you save the
expense And I dont care if you go along with all the old men from here
to Joppa What Im sayin is that Im goin to that Fair tomorrow I can
go alone in the cars I guess There wont nobody kidnap me as I know
of

But Kenelm I dont like to have you over there all by yourself Itll
be so lonesome for you If youll only wait maybe Ill go again myself
Maybe we could both go together on Saturday

I dont want to go Saturday I want to go tomorrow Tomorrows the
big day when they have the best horseracin Why Darius Holt is
callatin to make money tomorrow Hes got ten dollars bet on Exie B
in the second race and

Kenelm Parker Is THAT what you want to go to that Cattle Show for To
bet on horse trots To gamble

Aw dry up Howd I gamble You dont let me have money enough to put
in the collection box Sundays let alone gamblin I have to shove my
fist clear way down to the bottom of the plate whenever they pass it
for fear Heman Danielsll see that Im only lettin go of a nickel Aw
Hannah have some sense wont you Id just as soon go to that Fair
alone as not I wont be lonesome Lots of folks I know are goin men
and women too

Women What women

Oh I dont know How should I know

Wellwell I suppose likely they are Imogene said she was goin
and

Imogene You mean that hired inmate over to Thankful Barnes Humph
So she told you she was goin hey Well most likely she told a fib I
wouldnt trust her not to sassy impudent thing I dont believe shes
goin at all Is she Capn Bangs

The captain who had remained silent during this family jar could not
resist the temptation

Oh yes Imogenes goin he answered cheerfully Shes countin on
havin the time of her life over there But she isnt the only one
Why about all the females in East Wellmouthll be there I heard Abbie
Larkin arrangin for her passage with Winnie S yesterday afternoon Win
said Judas priest He didnt know where he was goin to put her but
he callated hed have to find stowage room somewhere Oh Kenelm wont
be lonesome Hannah I shouldnt worry about that

Kenelm looked as if he wished the speaker might choke Hannah
straightened in her chair

Hum she mused Hum and was silent for a moment Then she asked

Is Mrs Thankful goin too I suppose likely she is

The captains cheerfulness vanished

No he said shortly she isnt She wanted to but she doesnt feel
she can leave the boardinhouse with nobody to look after it

Miss Parker seemed pleased for some reason or other

I dont wonder she said heartily She shouldnt be left all alone
herself either If that ungrateful selfish Orphans Home minx is
selfish enough to go and leave her all the more reason my brother
shouldnt Whatever else us Parkers may be we aint selfish We think
about others Kenelm dear you must stay at work and help Mrs Barnes
around the house tomorrow You and Ill go to the Fair on Saturday I
dont mind Id just as soon go twice as not

Kenelm sprang to his feet He was so angry that he stuttered

YouyouYOU dont care he shouted Cause youre goin TWICE
Thats a divil of a dont care that is

Kenelm My own brother Cursin and swearin

I aint andand I dont care if I be Whats the matter with you
Hannah Parker One minute youre sailin into me tellin me to heave up
my job and not demean myself doin odd jobs in a boardinhouse barn
And the next minute youre tellin me I ought to stay to home andand
help out that very boardinhouse I wont Byby thundermighty I
wont Im goin to that Cattle Show tomorrow if it takes my last cent

Hannah smiled How many last cents have you got Kenelm she asked
You was doin your best to borrer a quarter of me this mornin

Ive got moren you have IIeverything there is hereyes and
every cent there is herebelongs to me by rights You aint got nothin
of your own

Miss Parker turned upon him To think she wailed brokenly to think
that my own brotherall the brother Ive gotcan stand afore me and
heave mymy poverty in my face I may be dependent on him I am I
suppose But Oh the disgrace of it theOh Oh Oh

Captain Obed hurried upstairs to his room Long after he had shut the
door he heard the sounds of Hannahs sobs and Kenelms pleadings that
he never meant nothin Then came silence and at last the sounds of
footsteps on the stairs They halted in the upper hall

I dont know Kenelm said Hannah sadly Ill try to forgive you
I presume likely I must But when I think of how Ive been a mother to
you

Now Hannah there you go again How could you be my mother when you
aint but four year oldern I be You just give me a few dollars and let
me go to that Cattle Show and

No Kenelm that I cant do You are goin to leave Mrs Barnes place
I want you to do that for the sake of your selfrespect But you must
stay there and help her tomorrow Its your duty

Darn my duty Ill LEAVE tomorrow thats what Ill do

Oh dear There you go again Profane language and bettin on horses
WHATLL come next My own brother a gambler and a prodigate Has it come
to this

The footsteps and voices died away Captain Obed blew out the light and
got into bed The last words he heard that night were uttered by the
prodigate himself on his way to his sleeping quarters And they were
spoken as a soliloquy

By time muttered Kenelm as he shuffled slowly past the Captains
door By time IIll do somethin desperate

Next morning when Captain Obeds hired motor car with its owner a
Wellmouth Centre man acting as chauffeur rolled into the yard of the
High Cliff House a party of three came out to meet it John Kendrick
and Emily Howes were of the party and they were wrapped and ready for
the trip The captain had expected them but the third also dressed for
the journey was Mrs Thankful Barnes Thankfuls plump countenance was
radiant

Im goin after all she announced Im goin to the Fair with you
Capn Bangs Now what do you think of that    That is she added
looking at the automobile if you can find a place to put me

The captains joy was as great as his surprise Place to put you he
repeated If I couldnt do anything else Id hang on behind like a
youngster to a truck wagon afore you stayed at home Good for you Mrs
Thankful But howd you come to change your mind Thought you couldnt
leave

Thankful smiled happily I didnt change my mind Capn she said
Imogene changed hers Shes a real good sacrificin body the girl
is When she found Id been asked and wouldnt go she put her foot down
flat Nothin would do but she should stay at home today and I should
go I knew what a disappointment twas to her but she just made me do
it Shell go tomorrow instead thats the way we fixed it finally Im
awful glad for myself but I do feel mean about Imogene just the same

A few minutes later the auto with John Emily and Thankful on the rear
seat and Captain Obed in front with the driver rolled out of the yard
and along the sandy road toward Wellmouth Centre About a mile from the
latter village it passed a buggy with two people in it The pair in the
buggy were Caleb Hammond and Hannah Parker

Captain Obed chuckled There go the sweethearts he observed
Handsome young couple aint they

The other occupants of the car joined in the laugh Emily in
particular was greatly amused

Why do you call them sweethearts Captain she asked You dont
really suppose

The captain burst into a laugh

What Those two he said No no I was only jokin I dont know
about Hannahsingle women her age are kind of chanceybut I do know
Caleb He aint takin a wife to support not unless she can support
him He had a chance to use a horse and buggy free for nothin thats
all and it would be against his principles to let a chance like that go
by Callate he took Hannah cause he knew ice cream and peanuts dont
agree with her dyspepsy and so he wouldnt have to buy any Ho ho I
wonder how Kenelm made out Wonder if he went on his own hook after
all

In the kitchen of the High Cliff House Imogene was washing the breakfast
dishes and trying to forget her disappointment A step sounded in the
woodshed and turning she beheld Mr Parker He saw her at the same
time and the surprise was mutual

Why hello exclaimed Imogene I thought youd gone to the Fair

Hello cried Kenelm Thought youd gone to the Cattle Show

Explanations followed What ARE you callatin to do then demanded
Kenelm moodily

Me Stay here on my job of course Thats what youre goin to do
too aint it

Mr Parker thrust his hands into his pockets

No by time I aint he declared fiercely I aint got any job no
more Ive quit I have

Quit You mean you aint goin to work for Mrs Thankful

I aint gain to work for nobody Why should I Ive got money enough
to live on aint I Ive got an income of my own I aint told Mrs
Thankful yet but I have quit just the same

Imogene put down the dishcloth

This is your sisters doins I guess likely she observed

No it aint Ifif it was by time I wouldnt do it Hannah treats
me like a dogyes sir like a dog Im goin to show her A mans got
some feelins if he is a dog

How are you goin to show her

I dont know but I be Ill run away if I cant do nothin else Ill
show her Im sick of her bossin

Imogene seemed to be thinking She regarded Mr Parker with a steady and
reflective stare

What are you lookin at me like that for demanded Kenelm after the
stare had become unbearable

I was thinkin Humph What would you do to fix it sos your sister
would stop her bossin and you could have your own way once in a while

Do By time Id do anything Anything by thundermighty

You would You mean it

You bet I mean it

Would you promise to stay right here and work for Mrs Thankful as long
as she wanted you to

Course I would I aint anxious to leave Its Hannah thats got that
notion Fust she was dead sot on my workin here and now shes just as
sot on my leavin

Do you know why shes sowhat do you call itsot

Kenelm fidgeted and looked foolish Well he admitted II wouldnt
wonder if twas account of you Imogene Hannah knows II like you
fust rate that were good friends I mean Sheswell consarn it
allshes jealous thats whats the matter Shes awful silly that
way I cant so much as look at a woman but she acts like a plumb
idiot Take that Abbie Larkin for instance One time sheho ho I did
kind of get ahead of her then though

Imogene nodded Yes she said I heard about that Well maybe you
can get ahead of her again You wait a minute

She went into the livingroom When she came back she had an inkbottle
a pen and a sheet of notepaper in her hands

Whats them things for demanded Mr Kenelm

Ill tell you pretty soon Kenelm youyou asked me somethin a while
ago didnt you

Kenelm started Whywhy Imogene he stammered II dont knows I
know what you mean

I guess you know all right You did ask meor anyhow you would if I
hadnt said no before you had the chance You like me pretty well dont
you Kenelm

This pointed question seemed to embarrass Mr Parker greatly He turned
red and glanced at the door

Whywhy yes I like you fust rate Imogene he admitted II dont
knows I ever see anybody I liked better But when it comes toYou see
that time when I saiderer what I said I was kind ofof desperate
along of Hannah and

Well youre desperate now aint you Here sharply you sit still
and let me finish Ive got a plan and youd better listen to it
Kenelm wont you sit still forfor my sake


The big day of the Ostable County Cattle Show and Fair came to an end
as all days big or little have to come Captain Obed Bangs and his
guests enjoyed every minute of it They inspected the various exhibits
witnessed the horse races and the baseball game saw the balloon
ascension and thrilled with the rest of the great crowd at the
parachute drop It was six oclock when they left the Fair grounds and
Thankful began to worry about the condition of affairs at the High Cliff
House

Itll be way past dinner time when you and I get there Emily she
said and goodness knows what my boarders have had to eat Imogenes
smart and capable enough but whether she can handle everything alone
I dont know We ought to have started sooner but its nobodys fault
moren mine that we didnt

However when the High Cliff House was reached its proprietor found that
her fears were groundless But a few of the boarders had planned to eat
their evening meal there most of the city contingent were stopping at
various teahouses and restaurants in Ostable or along the road and would
not be home until late

Everythings fine maam declared Imogene There was only three or
four here for supper and I fixed them all right Mr Hammond came in
late but I fed him up and hes gone to bed Tired out I guess I asked
him if he had a good time and he said he had but it cost him a sight of
money

Captain Obed laughed Caleb will have to do without his mornin
newspapers for quite a spell to make up for todays extravagance
he declared Thats what tis to take the girls around Better take
warnin John

John Kendrick smiled Considering he said that you and I have
almost come to blows before I was permitted to even buy a package of
popcorn with my own money I think you need the warning more than I
Capn Bangs

Imogene said Thankful youve been a real nice girl today youve
helped me out a lot and I shant forget it Now you go to bed and rest
sos to feel like gettin an early start for the Fair tomorrow

Imogene shook her head I cant go right now thank you maam she
said Ive got company

Emily and Thankful looked at each other

Company repeated the former What company

Before Imogene could answer the diningroom door was flung open and
Hannah Parker rushed in She was still arrayed in her Sunday gown
which she had donned in honor of Fair Day but her Sunday bonnet was
as Captain Obed said afterward canted down to leeward and her general
appearance indicated alarm and apprehension

Why Hannah exclaimed Thankful Why Miss Parker whats the
matter

Hannahs glance swept the group before her then it fastened upon
Imogene

Wheres my brother she demanded Have you seen my brother

Captain Bangs broke in

Your brother Kenelm he asked Why what about Kenelm Aint he to
home

No No he aint And he aint been home either I left a cold supper
for him on the table and I put the teapot on the rack of the stove
ready for him to bile But he aint been there It aint been touched
II cant think what

Imogene interrupted Your brothers all right Miss Parker she said
calmly Hes been havin supper with me out in the kitchen Hes there
now Hes the company I said I had Mrs Thankful

Hannah stared at her Imogene returned the gaze coolly blandly and with
a serene air of confident triumph

Perhaps youd better come out and see him maam she went on
Hewe that ishave got somethin to tell you The rest can come
too if they want to she added Its nothin we want to keep from
you

Hannah Parker pushed by her and rushed for the kitchen Imogene followed
her and the others followed Imogene As Thankful said describing her
own feelings I couldnt have stayed behind if I wanted to My feet had
curiosity enough to go by themselves

Kenelm who had been sitting by the kitchen table before a wellfilled
plate had heard his sisters approach and had risen When Mrs Barnes
and the others reached the kitchen he had backed into a corner

Kenelm Parker demanded Hannah what are you doin here this time of
night

II been eatin supper stammered Kenelm but IIm through now

Through Didnt you know your supper was waitin for you at home
Didnt I tell you to come home early and have MY supper ready Didnt

Imogene interrupted I guess you did maam she said but you see I
asked him to stay here so he stayed

YOU asked him And he stayed Well I must say Kenelm have you been
eatin supper alone with thatwith that

She was too greatly agitated to finish but as Kenelm did not answer
Imogene did without waiting

Yesm she said soothingly Its all right Kenelm and me can eat
together if we want to I guess Were engaged

ENGAGED Almost everyone said iteveryone except Hannah she could
not say anything

Yes replied Imogene Were engaged to be married We are arent we
Kenelm

Kenelm tried to back away still further but the wall was behind him
and he could only back against it He was pale and he swallowed several
times

Kenelm dear said Imogene didnt you hear me Tell your sister
about our bein engaged

Kenelms mouth opened and shut Eheh he stammered II

Dont be bashful urged Imogene Were engaged to be married aint
we

Mr Parker gulped choked and then nodded Yes he admitted faintly
II callate we be

His sister took a step forward her arm raised Captain Obed stepped in
front of her

Just a minute Hannah Heave to Come up into the wind a jiffy Lets
get this thing straight Kenelm do you mean

The gentleman addressed seemed to mean very little just then But
Imogenes coolness was quite unruffled and again she answered for him

He means just what he said she declared and what he said was plain
enough I should think I dont know why there should be so much row
about it Mr Parker and I have been good friends ever since I come here
to work Hes asked me to marry him some time or other and I said maybe
I would That makes us engaged sames Ive been tryin to tell you And
what all this row is about I cant see Its our business aint it I
cant see as its anybody elses

But Hannah was by this time beyond holding back She pushed aside the
captains arm and faced the engaged couple Her eyes flashed and her
fingers twitched

Youyou designin critter you she shouted addressing Imogene You
plannin schemin underhanded

Shh shh put in Captain Obed Easy Hannah easy there

I shant be easy You mind your own affairs Obed Bangs Kenelm Parker
how dare you sayhow dare you tell me youre goin to marry thisthis
INMATE What do you mean by it

Poor Kenelm only gurgled His lady love once more came to his rescue

Hes told you times enough what he means she asserted firmly And
Ill thank you not to call me names either In the first place I
wont stand it and in the second if you and me are goin to be
sistersinlaw wed better learn how to get along peaceable together
I

Dont you talk to me Dont you DARE talk to me I might have expected
it I did expect it So this is why you two didnt go to the Fair You
had this all planned between you I was to be got out of the way and

Thats enough of that too There wasnt any plannin about itnot
until today anyhow I didnt know he wasnt goin to the Fair and he
didnt know I wasnt He would have gone onlyonly you deserted him to
go off with your ownyour own gentleman friend Humph I should think
you would look ashamed

Miss Parkers shameor her feelings whatever they might beseemed
to render her speechless Her brother saw his chance

You know thats just what you done Hannah he put in pleadingly
You know you did I was so lonesome

Hush Hush Kenelm ordered Imogene You left him alone to go with
another man Miss Parker For all he knew you might bebe runnin off
to be married or somethin So he come to where he had a friend thats
all And what if he did He can get married if he wants to cant he
Id like to know whod stop him Hes over twentyone I guess

This speech was too much for Emily she laughed aloud That laugh was
the final straw Hannah made a dive for her brother

You come home with me she commanded You come right straight home
with me this minute As for you she added turning to Imogene
I shant waste any more words on aon a thing like you After my
brothers money be you Thought youd get him and it too did you
Well you shant Hell come right along home with me and there hell
stay Hes worked in this place as long as hes goin to Miss Inmate
Ill take him out of YOUR clutches

Oh no you wont Him and me are goin to the Fair tomorrow and on
Monday hes comin back to work here same as ever You are aint you
Kenelm

Kenelm gulped and fidgeted III he stuttered

You see Hannah continued ImogeneI suppose I might as well begin
to call you Hannah seein as were goin to be relations pretty
soonyou see hes engaged to me now and hell do what I ask him to of
course

Engaged He aint engaged Ill fix the engagement Thatll be broke
off this very minute

And now Imogene played her best trump She took from her waist a slip of
paper and handed it to Captain Obed

Just read that out loud wont you please Capn Bangs she asked

The captain stared at the slip of paper Then in a choked voice he
read aloud the following


I Kenelm Issachar Parker being in sound mind and knowing what I am
doing ask Imogene to be my wife and I agree to marry her any time she
wants me to

Signed KENELM ISSACHAR PARKER


There exclaimed Imogene I guess that settles it dont it Ive got
witnesses anyhow and right here to our engagement You all heard us
both say we was engaged But that paper settles it Kenelm and I knew
mighty well that youd try to break off the engagement and say there
wasnt any but you cant break THAT

I cant I like to know why I cant What do you suppose I care for
such aa

Well if you dont then the law does If you make your brother break
his engagement to me Hannah Parker Ill take that piece of paper right
to a lawyer and make him sue Kenelm forfor breach of promises You
know what that means I guess if youve read the papers same as I have
I rather guess that paper would give me a good many dollars damage If
you dont believe it you try and see And theres two lawyers livin
right in this house she added triumphantly

If she expected a sensation her expectations were realized Hannah was
again stricken dumb Captain Bangs and Emily and John Kendrick looked at
each other then the captain doubled up with laughter Mrs Barnes
and Kenelm however did not laugh The latter seemed tremendously
surprised

Whywhy Imogene he protested how you talk I never thought

Kenelm be still

But Imogene begged Thankful you mustnt say such things I
never

Now maam please dont you butt in I know what Im doin Please
dont talk to me now There Kenelm turning to the trembling nominee
for matrimonial offices thatll do for tonight You go along with your
sister and be on hand ready to take me to the Cattle Show tomorrow Good
nighterdear

Whether it was the dear that goaded Miss Parker into one more assault
or whether she was not yet ready to surrender is uncertain But at all
events she fired a last broadside

He SHANT go with you tomorrow she shrieked He shant I wont let
him

Imogene nodded All right she said firmly Then if he dont Ill
come around tomorrow and tell him Im ready to be married right away
And if he says no to THATthenwell then Ill go straight to the
lawyer with that paper

Ten minutes later when the Parkers had gone and the sound of Hannahs
tirade and Kenelms protestations had died away on the path toward their
home Thankful John and Captain Obed sat gazing at each other in
the living room Imogene and Emily were together in the kitchen The
engaged young lady had expressed a desire to speak with Miss Howes
alone

John and the captain were still chuckling but Thankful refused to see
the joke she was almost in tears

Its dreadful she declared Perfectly awful And Imogene To act and
speak so to our nextdoor neighbor What WILL come of it And how COULD
she How could she get engaged to THAT man of all men Hes old enough
to be her father andand she CANT care for him

Emily entered the room She was apparently much agitated and her eyes
were moist She collapsed in a rockingchair and put her handkerchief to
her face

Land sakes cried Captain Obed Is it as bad as that Does it make
you cry

Emily removed the handkerchief Im not crying she gasped IIOh
dear This is the funniest thing that girl has done yet

But what is it asked John Whats the answer Were dying to know

Emily shook her head I cant tell you she said I promised I
wouldnt Itit all came of a talk Imogene and I had a while ago We
were speaking of selfsacrifice and sheshe adores you Auntie and

Thankful interrupted Mercy on us she cried Adores me
Selfsacrifice She aint doin this crazy loony thing for ME I hope
She aint marryin that Parker man because

She hasnt married anyone yet Oh it is all right Auntie she knows
what she is doing or she thinks she does And at any rate I think
there is no danger of Mr Parkers giving up his situation here until
you are ready to have him do it There I mustnt say another word I
have said too much already

Captain Obed rose to his feet

Well he said its too thick off the bows for me to see moren a
foot I give in to that But I will say this If that Imogene girl dont
know what shes up to its the fust time since Ive been acquainted with
her And she sartin has spiked Hannahs guns Either Hannahs got to say
dum when Imogene says dee or she stands a chance to lose her brother
or his money one or tother and shed rather lose the fust than the
last Ill bet you Ho ho Yes it does look as if Imogene had Hannah
in a clove hitch    Well Im goin over to see what the next doins
in the circus is liable to be I wouldnt miss any of THIS show for no
money Good night




CHAPTER X


The next morning Kenelm arrayed in his best was early on hand to
escort the lady of his choice to the Fair The lady herself was ready
and the pair drove away in Winnie Ss depotwagon bound for Wellmouth
Centre and the train Before she left the house Imogene made an earnest
request

If you dont mind maam she said addressing Mrs Barnes I
wish you wouldnt say nothin to nobody about Mr Kenelm and me bein
engaged And just ask the rest of em that heard thethe roughhouse
last night not to say anything either please

Why Imogene said Thankful I didnt know you wanted it to be a
secret Seems to me you said yourself that it wasnt any secret

Yesm I know I did Well I suppose taint in one way But there
aint any use in advertisin it neither Kenelm hes promised to keep
still

But Imogene why Seems to me if I was willin to be engaged to
thatto Kenelm I wouldnt be ashamed to have folks know it

Oh I aint ashamed exactly I aint ashamed of what I done not a bit
Only whats the use of tellin

But youll have to tell some time when youre married sartin

Yesm Well we aint marriedyet

But youre goin to be I should presume likely

Maybe so but not for a good while anyhow If I am it wont make
any difference fars you and me are concerned maam Nor Mr Parker
either hell stay here and work longs you want him married or not
And soll I

Well I suppose thats one comfort anyhow I wont say anything about
your engagement and Ill ask the others not to But folks are bound to
talk Imogene Miss Parker nowhow are you goin to stop her tellin

Imogene nodded knowingly I shant have to Ill bet you maam
she said She aint so anxious to have it talked aboutnot slong as
theres a chance to break it off she aint Shell keep still

Maybe so but folksll suspect I guess Theyll think somethins queer
when you and Kenelm go to the Cattle Show together today

No they wont Why should they Didnt Hannah Parker herself go
yesterday with Mr Hammond And didnt Mr Kendrick go with Miss Emily
Yes and you with Capn Bangs Lordy maam I

Dont say Lordy Imogene cautioned Thankful and hastened away
Imogene looked after her and laughed to herself

When Captain Obed made his morning call Mrs Barnes told him of this
conversation

And how is Hannah this mornin asked Thankful I was surprised
enough to see Kenelm in that depotwagon I never thought for a minute
shed let him go

The captain chuckled Let him he repeated Why Hannah helped him
get ready picked out his necktie for him and loaded him up with clean
handkerchiefs and land knows what She all but give him her blessin
afore he started she did say she hoped hed have a good time

She did Mercy on us Is the world comin to an end Last night she
was

Yes I know Well weve got to give Hannah credit shes got a head
on her shoulders even if the head does run pretty strong to mouth
Imogenes took her measure judgin by what you said the girl said to
you Hannahs thought it over I callate and she figgers that while
theres life theres hope as you might say Her brother may be engaged
but he aint married and slongs he aint shes got a chance You
just see Mrs Thankfulyou see if Hannah aint sweeter to Kenelm from
this on than a molasses jug stopper to a young one Shell lay herself
out to make his home the softest spot in creation so hell think twice
before leavin it Thats her game as I see it and shell play it
Give Hannah credit she wont abandon the ship while theres a plank
above water Just watch and see

Thankful looked doubtful Well maybe so she said Maybe she will be
nice to her brother but how about the rest of us She wouldnt speak to
me last night nor to Emilyand as for Imogene

Yes I know But wait until she sees you or Imogene either next time
Shell be smooth as a smelt Ill bet you anything shell say that
after all she guesses the engagements a good thing and that Imogenes
a nice girl Theres a whole lot in keepin the feller youre fightin
off his guard until youve got him in a corner with his hands down Last
night Hannah give me my orders to mind my own business This mornin she
cooked me the best breakfast Ive had since I shipped aboard her vessel
And kept askin me to have more No Imogenes right Hannahll play
the game and shell play it quiet As for tellin anybody her brothers
engaged you neednt worry about that Shell be the last one to tell

This prophecy seemed likely to prove true The next time Thankful met
Hannah the latter greeted her like a longlost friend During a long
conversation she mentioned the subject of her brothers engagement but
once and then at the very end of the interview

Oh by the way Mrs Thankful she said I do beg your pardon for
carryin on the way I did at your house tother night The news was
pitched out at me so sudden that I was blowed right off my feet as you
might say I acted real unlikely I know but you see Kenelm does mean
so much to me that I couldnt bear to think of givin him up to anybody
else When I come to think it over I realized twant no moren I had
ought to have expected I mustnt be selfish and I aint goin to be
Slongs taint thatthat Jezebel of an Abbie Larkin I dont mind so
much I couldnt stand havin her in the familyTHAT I couldnt stand
Oh and if you dont mind Mrs Thankful just dont say nothin about
the engagin yet awhile I shouldnt mind of course but Kenelm hes
set on keepin it secret for a spell There I must run on Ive got to
go up to the store and get a can of that consecrated soup for supper
Have you tried them soups Theyre awful cheap and handy You just pour
in hot water and theres moren enough for a meal Goodby

Imogene when she returned from the Fair announced that she had had a
perfectly lovely time

He aint such bad companyKenelm I mean she observed He talks
a lot but you dont have to listen unless you want to and he enjoys
himself real well considerin how little practice hes had

Did you meet anyone you knew asked Emily

Nom We saw quite a lot of folks from East Wellmouth but we saw em
first so we didnt meet em One kind of funny thing happened a man
who was outside a snake tent hollerin for everybody to come in saw us
and he says to me Girlie he sayshe was a fresh guy like all them
kindGirlie he says ask your pa to take you in and see the Serpent
King eat em alive Only ten cents Pop he says to Kenelm Dont miss
the chance to give your little girl a treat Kenelm was all frothed
up at bein took for my father but I told him he neednt get madif I
could stand it he could I guessed

Kenelm reported for work as usual on Monday morning and he
workedactually worked all day For an accepted lover he appeared
rather subdued and silent Captain Obed who noticed his behavior
commented upon it

Callate Kenelms beginnin to realize gettin engaged dont mean all
joy he said with a chuckle Hes just got two bosses instead of one
thats all Hes scart to death of Hannah at home and when hes
here Imogene orders him round the way a bucko mate used to order a
roustabout I said Hannah was in a clove hitch didnt I Well she is
but Kenelmwell Kenelms like a young one runnin tiddly on thin
iceworsen that cause he cant stop on either side got to keep
runnin between em and look out and not fall in

Labor Day the day upon which the Cape summer season really ends did
not to the High Cliff House mean the general exodus which it means to
most of the Cape hotels Some of Thankfuls lodgers left of course but
many stayed and were planning to stay through September if the weather
continued pleasant But on the Saturday following Labor Day it rained
And the next day it rained harder and on Monday began a series of cold
windy gloomy days which threatened to last indefinitely One after
the other the sojourners from the cities passed from grumbling at the
weather to trunkpacking and leaving A few stayed on into the next week
but when at the end of that week a storm set in which was more severe
than those preceding it even these optimists surrendered Before that
third week was over the High Cliff House was practically deserted
Except for Heman Daniels and John Kendrick and Miss Timpson and Caleb
Hammond Thankful and Emily and Imogene were alone in the big house

This upsetting of her plans and hopes worried Thankful not a little
Emily too was troubled concerning her cousins business outlook The
High Cliff House had been a success during its first season but it
needed the expected September and early October income to make it a
success financially The expense had been great much greater than
Thankful had expected or planned It is true that the boarders almost
without exception had reengaged rooms and board for the following
summer but summer was a long way off There was the winter to be lived
through and if as they had hoped additions and enlargements to the
establishment were to be made in the spring more a good deal more
money would be needed

As I see it Auntie said Emily when they discussed the situation
you have splendid prospects here Your first season has been all or
more than you dared hope for and if we had had good weatherthe sort
of weather everyone says the Cape usually has in the fall monthsyou
would have come out even or better But even then to make this scheme
a real moneymaker you would be obliged to have more sleepingrooms
made over and a larger diningroom Now why dont you go and see
thiswhat is hecousin of yours Mr Cobb and tell him just how you
stand Tell him of your prospects and your plans and get him to advance
you another thousand dollarsmore if you can get it Why dont you do
that

Thankful did not answer She had few secrets from Emily whom she loved
as dearly as a daughter but one secret she had kept Just why she had
kept this one she might not have been able to explain satisfactorily
even to herself She had written Emily of her visit to Solomon Cobbs
henhouse and of the loan on mortgage which had resulted therefrom But
she had neither written nor told all of the circumstances of that visit
especially of Mr Cobbs attitude toward her and his reluctance to lend
the money She said merely that he had lent it and Emily had evidently
taken it for granted that the loan was made because of the relationship
and kindly feeling between the two Thankful even now did not
undeceive her She felt a certain shame in doing so a shame in
admitting that a relative of hers could be so mean and disobliging

Why dont you go to Mr Cobb again Auntie repeated Emily He will
lend you more Im sure if you explain all the circumstances It would
be a perfectly safe investment for him and you would pay interest of
course

Mrs Barnes shook her head I dont think Id better Emily she said
Hes got one mortgage on this place already

What of it That was only for fifteen hundred and you have improved the
house and grounds ever so much since then I think hell be glad to
let you have another thousand The mortgage he has is to run for three
years you said didnt you

Again Thankful did not answer She had not said the mortgage was for
a term of three years Emily had presumed that it was and she had not
undeceived her She hesitated and Emily noticed her hesitation

It is for three years isnt it Auntie she repeated

Mrs Barnes tried to evade the question

Why not exactly Emily she replied It aint You see he thought
three years was a little mite too long and soand so we fixed up for a
shorter time Its all right though

Is it You are sure Aunt Thankful tell me truly how long a term is
that mortgage

Well itsits only for a year but

A year Why then it will fall due next spring You cant pay that
mortgage next spring can you

I dont knows I can butbut itll be all right anyhow Hell renew
it if I ask him to I presume likely

Of course he will He will have to Auntie you must go and see him at
once If you dont I shall

If there was one point on which Thankful was determined it was that
Emily should not meet Solomon Cobb The moneylender had visited the
High Cliff premises but once during the summer and then Miss Howes was
providentially absent

No no declared Mrs Barnes hastily You shant do any such thing
The idea I guess I can tend to borrowin money from my own relation
without draggin other folks into it Ill drive over and see him pretty
soon

You must go at once I shant permit you to wait another week It is
almost time for me to go back to my schoolwork and I shant go until
I am certain that mortgage is to be renewed and that your financial
affairs are all right Do go Auntie please Arrange to have the
mortgage renewed and try to get another loan Promise me you will go
tomorrow

So Thankful was obliged to promise and the following morning she drove
George Washington over the long road now wet and soggy from the rain
to Trumet

Mr Solomon Cobbs henhouse looked quite as dingy and dirty as when
she visited it before Solomon himself was just as shabby and he pulled
at his whiskers with his accustomed energy

Hello he said peering over his spectacles What do you want   
Oh its you is it Whats the matter

Thankful came forward Matter she repeated What in the worldwhat
made you think anything was the matter

Solomon stared at her fixedly

What did you come here for he asked

To see you Thats worth comin for isnt it

The joke was wasted as all jokes seemed to be upon Mr Cobb He did not
smile

What made you come to see me he asked still staring

What made me

Yes What made you Have you foundhas anybody told
youeranything

Anybody told me My soul and body Thats what you said when I was here
before Do you say it to everybody What on earth do you mean by it Who
would tell me anything And what would they tell

Solomon pulled his whiskers Nothin I guess he said after a
moment Only theres so much fool talk runnin loose I didnt know but
you might have heard I waswas dead or somethin I aint

I can see that I hope And if you was I shouldnt be traipsin ten
miles just to look at your remains Time enough for that at the funeral
Dead The idea

Umwell all right I aint dead yet Set down wont ye

Thankful sat down Mr Cobb swung about in his own chair so that his
face was in the shadow

Hear youve been doin pretty well with that boardinhouse of yours
he observed Hear its been full up all summer

Who told you so

Oh I heard I hear about all thats goin on one way or another I
was over there a fortnit ago

You were Why didnt you stop in and see me You havent been there but
once since the place started

Yes I have Ive been by a good many times Didnt stop though Too
many of them city dudes around to suit me Did you fetch your October
interest money

No I didnt It aint due till week after next When it is Ill send
it same as I have the rest

All right all right I aint askin you for it What did you come
for

And then Thankful told him He listened without comment until she
had finished peering over his spectacles and keeping up the eternal
weeding

There concluded Mrs Barnes thats what I came for Will you do
it

The answer was prompt enough this time

No I wont said Solomon with decision

Thankful was staggered

You wont she repeated You wont

I wont lend you no more money Why should I

You shouldnt I suppose if you dont want to But the way I look at
it it would be a perfectly safe loan for you My prospects are fine
everybody says so

Everybody says a whole lot of things If Id put up money on what
everybody said Id be puttin up at the poorhouse myself But I aint
puttin up there and I aint puttin up the money neither

All right keep it thenkeep it and sleep on it if you want to I
can get along without it I guess or if I cant I can borrow it of
somebody else

Humph Youre pretty sassy seems to me for anybody thats askin
favors

Im not askin favors I told you that when I first come to you What I
asked was just business and nothin else

Is that so As I understand it youre askin to have a mortgage
renewed That may be business or it may be a favor cordin to how you
look at it

Thankful fought down her temper The renewal of the mortgage was a vital
matter to her If it was not renewed what should she do What could she
do All she had in the world and all her hopes for the future centered
about her property in East Wellmouth If that were taken from her

Well she admitted perhaps it is a favor then

Perhaps tis Why should I renew that mortgage I dont callate to
renew mortgages as a general thing Did I say anything about renewin
it when I took it I dont remember that I did

No noI guess you didnt But I hope you will If you
dontIISolomon Cobb that boardinhouse means everything to me
Ive put all Ive got in it It has got the best kind of a start and in
another yearIIPlease Oh PLEASE dont close me out

Humph

Please dont You told me when I was here before what a lot you thought
of my Uncle Abner You knew how much he thought of me When you think of
him and what he said

Mr Cobb interrupted Said he repeated sharply What do you mean he
said Eh What do YOU know he said

Whywhy he told you about me You said yourself he did How much he
thought of me and all

Is that all you meant

Yes of course What else is there to mean Solomon you profess to be
a Christian You knew my uncle He did lots of favors for you I know he
did Now

Sshh shh Mr Cobb seemed strangely perturbed He waved his hand
Hush he repeated What are you draggin Capn Abner and Christianity
and all that in for They aint got nothin to do with that mortgage
Who said they had

Why no one said it No one said anything no one but me I dont know
what you mean

Mean I dont mean nothin There There Clear out and dont bother
me no more today ImI aint feelin well Got a cold comin on I
callate Clear off home and let me alone

But I cant go until you tell me about that mortgage

Yes you can too I cant tell you about nothin just now I got to
think aint I Maybe Ill renew that mortgage and maybe I wont Ill
tell you when I make up my mind Time enough between now and spring
IAh Ezry how be you Come on in Glad to see you

The last portion of the foregoing was addressed to a man who had entered
the office Mr Cobb did look as if he was really glad to see him

Thankful rose Ill go she said drearily I suppose I might as
well But I shant sleep much until you make up that mind of yours And
do make it up the right way for my sakeand Uncle Abners

Her relative waved both hands this time

Shh he ordered desperately Dont say no more now I dont want the
whole creation to know my business and yours Go on home IIll come
over and see you by and by

So because she saw there was no use remaining Mrs Barnes went The
drive home through the dismal grayness of the cloudy afternoon seemed
longer and more trying than the trip over The dream of raising money
for the spring additions and alterations was over the High Cliff House
must do its best as it was for another year at least As to the renewal
of the mortgage there was a faint hope Mr Cobbs final remarks had
inspired that hope He had been on the point of refusing to renew
Thankful was sure of that Then something was said which caused him
to hesitate Mrs Barnes looked out between the ears of jogging George
Washington and spoke her thought aloud

Its somethin to do with Uncle Abner she soliloquized He dont
like to have Uncle Abner mentioned Hum I wonder what the reason is I
only wish I knew

To Emily who was eagerly waiting to hear the result of her cousins
visit to Solomon Cobb Thankful told but a portion of the truth She
did say however that the additional loan appeared to be out of the
question and she guessed they would have to get on without the needed
alterations for another year Emily thought they should not

If this place is to become really profitable Auntie she insisted
those changes should be made I dont see why this Mr Cobb wont lend
you the money but if he wont then Im sure someone else will if you
ask Dont you know anyone here in East Wellmouth whom you might ask for
a loanon your prospects

No No I dont

Why yes you do There is Captain Bangs for instance He is well to
do and Im sure he is a good friend Why dont you ask him

Thankfuls answer was prompt and sharp

Indeed I shant she declared

Then I will Ill be glad to

Emily Howes if you say one word to Capn Obed about borrowin money
from him IllIll never speak to you afterwards Go to Captain Obed
The idea

But why not Auntie He IS a friend and

Of course he is thats the very reason He is a friend and hed
probably lend it because he is whether he knew hed ever get it back
or not No when I borrow money itll be of somebody that lends it as a
business deal not from friendship

But Auntie you went to Mr Cobb because he was your relative You
said that was the very reason why you went to him

Um yes Well I may have GONE to him for that reason but there aint
any relationship in that mortgage of his dont you get the notion that
there is

Emilys next question naturally concerned the renewal of that
mortgage Mrs Barnes said shortly that she guessed the renewal would be
all right

Hes comin over to settle it with me pretty soon she added Now
dont worry your head off any more about mortgages and loans Emily
Youre goin to leave me pretty soon lets not spend our last days
together frettin about money That mortgage is all right Maybe the
extra loan will be too Maybewhy maybe Mr Kendrick would lend it
if I asked him

Mr Kendrick Why Auntie Mr Kendrick has no money or only a very
little He is doing wellvery well considering how short a time he
has practised his profession here but Im sure he has no money to lend
Why he tells me

The expression of Mrs Barnes face must have conveyed a meaning at any
rate Emilys sentence broke off in the middle She colored and seemed
embarrassed

Thankful smiled Yes she observed drily I notice he tells you a
lot of thingsa whole lot more than he does anybody else Generally
speakin he is about the closestmouthed young man about his personal
affairs that I ever run across However I aint jealous not a mite
And twant of him I was speakin twas his cousin Mr E Holliday
Kendrick Hes got money enough I guess Maybe he might make a loan on
decent security Hes a possibility Ill think him over

Mr E Holliday and his doings were still East Wellmouths favorite
conversational topics The great man was preparing to close his summer
house and return to New York His family had already goneto Lenox
where they were to remain for a few weeks and then journey to Florida
E Holliday remained several of the servants remaining with him but
he too was to go very soon There were rumors that he remained because
of other schemes concerning his new estate Just what those schemes were
no one seemed to know If John Kendrick knew he told no one not even
Emily Howes

But E Holliday himself disclosed his plan and it was to Thankful Barnes
that he did so He called at the High Cliff House one afternoon and
asked to see its proprietor Thankful was a trifle flustered It was the
first call which her wealthy neighbor had made upon her and she could
not understand why he came at this late date

For mercy sakes come into the livinroom with me Emily she begged
I shant know how to act in the face of all that money

Emily was much amused I never knew you to be frightened of money
before Auntie she said I thought you were considering borrowing
some of this veryahempersonage

Maybe I was though I callate I should have took it out in
consideration I never would have gone to him and asked But now
thewhat do you call itpersonagecome to me for somethin the land
knows what

Perhaps HE wants to borrow

Humph Perhaps he does Well then hes fishin in the wrong
puddle Emily Howes stop laughin and makin jokes and come into that
livinroom same as I ask you to

But this Emily firmly declined to do Hes not my caller Auntie she
said He didnt even ask if I were in

So Thankful went into the livingroom alone to meet the personage And
she closed all doors behind her If you wont help you shant listen
she declared And I dont knows Ill tell you a word after hes gone

The call was a long one It ended in an odd way Emily sitting by the
diningroom window heard the front door slam and looking out saw
Mr Kendrick stalking down the path a frown on his face and outraged
dignity in his bearing A moment later Thankful burst into the
diningroom Her cheeks were flushed and she looked excited and angry

What do you think thatthat walkin moneybag came here for she
demanded He came here to tell me Id got to sell this place to him
Yes sell it to him cause he wanted it It didnt seem to make any
difference what I wanted Well it will make a difference I tell you
that

When she had calmed sufficiently she told of the interview with her
neighbor E Holliday had lost no time in stating his position The High
Cliff House it appeared was a source of annoyance to him and his A
boardinghouse no matter how genteel or wellconducted a boardinghouse
it may be could not longer be tolerated in that situation The boarders
irritated him by trespassing upon his premises by knocking their tennis
balls into his garden beds by bathing and skylarking on the beach in
plain sight from his verandas And the house and barn interfered with
his view He wished to be perfectly reasonable in the matter Mrs
Barnes of course understood that He was willing to pay for the
privilege of having his own way But boiled down and shorn of
politeness and subterfuge his proposition was that Thankful should sell
her property to him after which he would either tear down the buildings
on that property or move them to a less objectionable site

But Auntie cried Emily of course you told him you didnt want to
sell

Sartin I did I told him all I had was invested here that my first
season had been a good one considerin twas the first and that my
prospects were all I had a right to hope for I told him I was sorry
if my boarders had plagued him and Id try to see they didnt do so any
more But I couldnt think of sellin out

And what did he say to that

What didnt he say What I said didnt make a bit of difference
He made proclamation that any reasonable price I might name he would
consider He wouldnt submit to what he called extortion of course
but he would be perfectly fair and all that I kept sayin no and he
kept sayin yes Our talk got more and more sultry long towards the last
of it He told me that he made it a pint to get what he wanted and he
was goin to get it now One thing he told me I didnt know afore
and its kind of odd too He said the land this house sits on used to
belong to him once His father left it to him He sold it a long while
ago afore my Uncle Abner bought I guess Now hes sorry he sold

That was queer what else did he say

Oh he said a whole lot about his desire to make East Wellmouth his
permanent residence about the taxes he paid and what he meant to
do for the town I told him that was all right and fine and the town
appreciated it but that Id got to think of myself this boardinhouse
idea was a lifelong ambition of mine and I couldnt give it up

And how did it end

Just where it begun His last words to me was that if I wouldnt listen
to reason then hed have to try other ways And he warned me that he
should try em I said go ahead and try or words not quite so sassy
but meanin the same And out he marched Oh Emily WHAT do you suppose
hell try He cant MAKE me sell out can he Oh dear Oh dear heres
more trouble And I thought there was enough already

Emily did her best to reassure her relative telling the latter that of
course she could not be forced into parting with what was her own and
that Mr Kendrick was talking merely for effect but it was plain that
Miss Howes herself was troubled

I think you should consult a lawyer Auntie she said I am sure I
am right and that that man cant make you do what you dont want to do
But I dont know of course and a lawyer would know because that is
his business Why dont you ask JohnMr John Kendrick I mean He will
advise you

Thankful nodded I will she said

But John did not come home for dinner that night He had business which
called him to Wellmouth Centre that afternoon and it was late in the
evening when he returned Heman Daniels was late for dinner also
and when he entered the diningroom there was an air of mystery and
importance about him which everyone noticed Miss Timpson who seldom
permitted reticence to interfere with curiosity asked him what was the
matter

I do declare Mr Daniels she said you look as if you had the cares
of the nation on your shoulders tonight Has anything gone wrong with
one of those important cases of yours

Mr Daniels shook his head No he answered gravely My cases are
progressing satisfactorily My worries just now are not professional
I heard some news this afternoon whicherupset me somewhat that is
all

News Upsettin news Land sakes do tell us What is it

But Mr Daniels refused to tell The news concerned other people he
said and he was not at liberty to tell He trusted Miss Timpson would
excuse him under the circumstances

Miss Timpson was therefore obliged to excuse him though it was plain
that she did so under protest She made several more or less direct
attempts to learn the secret and failing went out to attend
prayermeeting Caleb Hammond went out also though the club not
prayermeeting was his announced destination Heman finished his dinner
alone When he had finished he sent word by Imogene that when Miss Howes
was at liberty he should like to speak with her

Emily who was in the kitchen with Thankful and Captain Obed the latter
having as usual dropped in on his way to the postoffice seemed in no
hurry to speak with Mr Daniels It was not until half an hour later
when the message was repeated that she bade the captain good night and
started for the livingroom Captain Obed and Thankful smiled at each
other

Hemans a heap more anxious to see her than she is to see him
observed the former Hes pretty fur gone in that direction judgin by
the weather signs

Thankful nodded

I callate thats so she agreed Still hes been just as fur gone
with others if all they says true Mr Daniels is a fascinator so
everybody says

Yup Prides himself on it always seemed to me But there generally
comes a time when that kind of a ladykiller gets hit himself Lots of
females have been willin to marry Heman but hes never given em the
chance About so fur hell go and then shy off

How about that widow woman over to Bayport

Well I did think he was goin to cast anchor there but he aint up
to now That widows wuth a lot of moneyher husband owned any quantity
of cranberry bog propertyand all hands callated Heman had his eye
on it Maybe he and the widow would have signed articles only for Miss
Howes heavin in sight

Well I suppose hes a good man I never heard a word against him that
way And hes a risin lawyer

Yesor riz

Yes Butbut I somehow wouldnt want Emily to marry him

Captain Obed agreed heartily Neither would I he declared Then
after a moment he added Hasnt it seemed to you that John Kendrick
was kind ofwell kind of headin up towardstowards

Yes Yees I have thought so I joke Emily a little about him
sometimes

So do I John How do you think shewith a jerk of the head toward
the livingroomfeelserthat way

I dont know She likes him Im sure of that But so fur as I know
theres no understandin between them And anyhow John couldnt think
of gettin married not for a long spell He hasnt got any money

No not yet he aint but he will have some day or I miss my guess
Hes gettin more popular on the Cape all the time and popular in
the right places too Why the last time I was in South Denboro Capn
Elisha Warren spoke to me about him and if Capn Lisha gets interested
in a young feller it means a lot Lishas got a lot of influence

You say you joke with John about Emily Hows he take the jokes

Oh he takes em all right You cant get him mad by teasin
him cause he wont tease He generally comes right back at me
abouterthat is

About what

Ohnothin Just nonsense thats all Well I callate Id better be
goin if I want to fetch the postoffice afore its shut up

But he was destined not to fetch the postoffice that night He had
risen to go when the diningroom door opened and Emily appeared Her
face was flushed and she seemed excited and angry

Auntie she said sharply Auntie will you come into the livingroom
a moment I want you to hear what thatwhat Mr Daniels says Dont
stop to talk Come Captain Bangs you may come too You areare his
friend and you should hear it

Surprised and puzzled Thankful and the captain followed her through the
diningroom to the livingroom There they found Heman Daniels standing
by the center table looking embarrassed and uncomfortable

Now Mr Daniels said Emily I want you to tell my cousin and
Captain Bangs just what you have told me Its not trueI know its not
true and I want them to be able to contradict such a story Tell them

Heman fidgeted with the papercutter on the table

I merely told Miss Howes he said nervously what was told me It
was told me by one of the parties most interested and so I accepted it
as the truth II have no personal interest in the matter Asas a
friend andand a lawyerI offered my services that is all I

He was interrupted by the opening of the front door John Kendrick
wearing his light overcoat and hat in hand entered the livingroom

Im awfully sorry to be so late Mrs Barnes he began I was
detained at the Centre Hello Captain Good evening Daniels Good
evening Miss Howes

Captain Obed and Thankful said Good evening Neither Emily nor Heman
returned the greeting John for the first time appeared to notice
that something was wrong He looked from Mrs Barnes to Captain Bangs
standing together at one side of the table and at Daniels and Emily
at the other side Heman had moved closer to the young lady and in his
manner was a hint of confidential understanding almost of protection

Kendrick looked from one pair to the other When he next spoke it was to
Emily Howes

Why whats the matter he asked with a smile This looks like a
council of war

Emily did not smile

Mr Kendrick she said I am very glad you came Now you can deny it
yourself

John gazed at her in puzzled surprise

Deny it he repeated Deny what

Before Miss Howes could answer Heman Daniels spoke

Kendrick he said importantly Miss Howes has heard something
concerning you which she doesnt like to believe

Indeed Did she hear it from you may I ask

She did

And that is why she doesnt believe it Daniels Im surprised Even
lawyers should occasionally

Emily interrupted Oh stop she cried Dont joke please This is
not a joking matter If what I have been told IS true I shouldBut I
know it isntI KNOW it

John bowed Thank you he said What have you heard

She has heard began Heman

Pardon me Daniels I asked Miss Howes

Emily began a reply but she did not finish it

I have been told she began I have been toldOh I cant tell you
I am ashamed to repeat such wicked nonsense Mr Daniels may tell you
it was he who told me

John turned to his fellow practitioner

Very well he said Now Daniels what is it

Heman did not hesitate

Miss Howes has heard he said deliberately that your client Mr
Holliday Kendrick is determined to force Mrs Barnes here into selling
him this house and land to force her to sell whether she wishes it or
not Is that true

John nodded gravely

Im afraid it is he said He seems quite determined In fact he
said he had expressed that determination to the lady herself He did
that didnt he Mrs Barnes

Thankful who had been so far a perplexed and troubled listener
answered

Why yes she admitted He was here today and he give me to
understand that he wanted this property of mine and was goin to have
it If I wouldnt agree to sell it to him now then hed drive me into
sellin later on Thats about what he said

Captain Obed struck his fists together

The swab he exclaimed Well if that dont beat all my goin to sea
Humph Id like to know how he callates to do it

Anything more Daniels inquired John

Yes there is something more What we want to know from you Kendrick
is whether or not you as his legal adviser propose to help him in this
scheme of his That is what we wish to know

We What we Has Mrs Barnesor Miss Howeshave they engaged you as
their attorney Daniels

Before Daniels could reply Emily asked a question

Did hehas he asked you to help him she demanded Has he

John smiled I doubt if it could be called asking he observed He
gave me orders to that effect shortly after he left here

Emily gasped Thankful and Captain Obed said Oh in concert Heman
Daniels smiled triumphantly

You see Miss Howes he said

One moment Daniels broke in Kendrick sharply You havent answered
my question yet Just where do you come in on this

II began Daniels but once more Emily interrupted

Are you she cried Tell me are you going to help that man force my
cousin into giving up her home

Again John smiled Well to be frank he said since it IS her home
and she doesnt wish to sell it I cant for the life of me see how she
can be forced into selling with or without my valuable aid Miss Howes
I

Stop You persist in treating this affair as a joke It is NOT a
joketo my cousin or to me Did you tell that man you would help him

No

I knew it I was certain of it Of course you didnt

Pardon me Miss Howes put in Daniels We have not heard all yet
Kendrick do I understand that you told your cousin anderbenefactor
that you would NOT help him in his infamous scheme

Johns patience was nearing its limits He smiled no more

I dont know what you understand Daniels he said crisply Your
understanding in many matters is beyond me

But did you say you would not help him persisted Emily

Why no not exactly He did not wait to hear what I had to say He
seemed to take my assistance for granted

Daniels laughed scornfully

You see Miss Howes he said again Then turning to Thankful Mrs
Barnes I met Mr Holliday Kendrick on the street just after he had come
from the interview with hiserattorney He told me that he intended
to force you into giving up your property to him and he told me also
that his cousin here had the case in his hands and would work to
carry it through There seemed to be no doubt in his mind that this
gentleman indicating John had accepted the responsibility In fact
he said he had

Captain Obed snorted Thats plaguy nonsense he declared I know
better John aint that kind of feller You wouldnt help anybody to
turn a woman out of her house and home would you John Course you
wouldnt The swab Just cause hes got money he callates he can run
everything Well he cant

Goodness knows I hope he cant moaned Thankful

And in the meantime we are waiting to hear what his lawyer has to say
observed Heman

John stepped forward Daniels he said it strikes me that your
wes are a bit frequent Why are you interfering in this affair

Mr Daniels drew himself up I am not interfering he replied My
interest is purely that of a friend AS a friend I told Miss Howes
what your cousin said to me She seemed to doubt my word In justice to
myself I propose to prove that I have spoken the truth that is all So
far I think I may say that I have proved it Now I demand to know what
you intend doing Are you for Mrs Barnes or against her

So you demand that do you

I do Will you answer

No

Ah ha I thought not

Ill answer no demands from you Why should I If Mrs Barnes or Miss
Howes asks me I will answer of course

Mr Kendrick began Thankful Emily interrupted

Wait Auntie she said He must answer me first Mr Kendrick when
that man came to you with his orders as you call them you must have
had some opportunity to speak Why didnt you refuse at once

For the first time John hesitated Well he said slowly for one
reason I was taken completely by surprise

So was Aunt Thankful when he came to her But she refused

And for another there were certain circumstances which made it hard
to refuse pointblank In a way I suppose Mr Kendrick was justified in
assuming that I would work for his interests I accepted his retaining
fee You remember that I hesitated before doing so butbut I did
accept and I have acted as his attorney since I

Stop I did not ask for excuses I ask you as Mr Daniels asked are
you for my cousin or against her

And I ask you what is Mr Daniels warrant for asking me anything

Answer my question Will you fight for my cousins rights or have you
sold yourself toto this benefactor of yours

John flushed at the repetition of the word

I have tried to give value received for whatever benefactions have come
my way he said coldly This matter may be different in a way it
is But not as Mr Holliday Kendrick sees it When a lawyer accepts a
retaining feenot for one case but for all cases which his client may
give himhe is by the ethics of his profession honor bound to

Honor scornfully Suppose we omit the honor

That is not easy to do I AM my cousins attorney But as Mrs Barnes
friend and yours I

Emily stamped her foot Friend she cried I dont care for such
friends I have heard enough I dont wish to hear any more You were
right Mr Daniels I apologize for doubting your word Aunt Thankful
you must settle this yourself II am through II am going Please
dont stop me

She was on her way to the door of the diningroom Heman Daniels called
her name

One minute Miss Howes he said I trust you will not forget you have
one friend who will be only too glad to work for Mrs Barnes interests
and yours I am at your service

Thank you thank you Mr Daniels II have no doubt we shall need
your services But please dont

John Kendrick was at her side

Miss HowesEmily he pleaded Dont misunderstand me

She burst out at him like as Captain Obed said afterward an August
thunder tempest

Misunderstand she repeated I dont misunderstand I understand
quite well Dont speak to me again

The door closed behind her Thankful after an instants hesitation
hurried out after her

Excuse me gentlemen said Daniels and followed Mrs Barnes

Captain Obed turned to his friend

For the Lord sakes John he shouted What in the everlastin do you
mean What did you let her go that way for Why didnt you tell her you
wouldnt do it

But Kendrick paid not the slightest attention He was gazing at the door
through which Emily and Thankful had disappeared His face was white

John repeated the captain

Hush ordered John He strode to the door and opened it

Emily he cried Emily

There was no answer John waited a moment and then turned and walked to
the window where he raised the shade and stood looking out

John said the captain again

Hush Dont say anything to me now

So Captain Obed did not speak A few minutes later the diningroom door
opened and Mr Daniels entered His expression was one of complete not
to say malicious satisfaction John turned at the opening of the door

Emily he began Then seeing Daniels he remained silent looking at
him

Kendrick said Heman with dignity in the matter which we have just
been discussing you will hereafter deal with me That is Mrs Barnes
wish and also Miss Howes

John did not reply Once more he walked to the door and opened it

Miss Howes he called Emily If you will let me explainEmily

Ill go fetch her declared Captain Obed John pushed him back

Dont interfere Captain he said sharply Emily

No answer Daniels made the next remark

Im afraid you dont get the situation Kendrick he said Neither
Miss Howes nor Mrs Barnes cares to see you or speak with you After
this you are to deal with me They have asked me as a FRIEND
emphasizing the word to act as their representative in this and all
matters

John turned and looked at the speaker

In all matters he asked slowly

Yes sir in all

And they refuse to see me

It woulderseem so    Is there anything further Kendrick If
not then this affair between yourerclient and mine would appear to
be a matter of skill for you and me to contest Well see who wins

John still looked at him

So thats it then he said after a moment You and I are to
determine which is the better lawyer

So it would seem Though considering my record and experience I dont
know that

That such a test is necessary I dont know that it is either But
well have it

He walked from the room and they heard him ascending the stairs Captain
Obed swore aloud Heman Daniels laughed




CHAPTER XI


The next morning the captain was an early caller Breakfast at the
High Cliff House was scarcely over when he knocked at the kitchen door
Imogene opened the door

Mr Kendrick aint here she said in answer to the callers question
Hes gone

Gone So early Wheres he gone down to his office

I dont know Hes gone thats all I do know He didnt stop for any
breakfast either

Humph Thats funny Wheres Mrs Thankful

Shes up in Miss Emilys room Miss Emily didnt come down to breakfast
neither Ill tell Mrs Barnes youre here

When Thankful came she looked grave enough

Im awful glad to see you Capn she said Ive been wantin to talk
to some sane person the one Ive been talkin to aint sane not now
Come into the dininroom Imogene you neednt finish clearin away
till I tell you to You stay in the kitchen here

When she and Captain Obed were in the diningroom alone and with both
doors closed Thankful told of the mornings happenings

Theyre bad enough too she declared Almost as bad as that silly
business last nightor worse if such a things possible To begin
with Mr John Kendricks gone

Yes Imogene said hed gone But what made him go so early

You dont understand Capn I mean hes gonegone for good He isnt
goin to board or room here any more

Captain Obed whistled Whew he exclaimed You dont mean it

I wish I didnt but I do I didnt see him this mornin he went too
early for that but he took his suitcase and his trunk is all packed and
locked He left a note for me with a check for his room rent and board
in it The note said that under the circumstances he presumed I would
agree twas best for him to go somewheres else at once He thanked me
for my kindness and said some real nice thingsbut hes gone

Tut tut Dear dear Wheres he gone to Did he say

No Ive told you all he said I suppose likely I ought to have
expected it and perhaps if he is goin to work for that cousin of his
and against me its best that he shouldnt stay here but Ill miss him
awfula good deal moren I miss the money hes paid me and the land
knows I need that I cant understand why he acted the way he did last
night It dont seem like him at all

Humph I should say it didnt And it aint like him either Theres a
nigger in the woodpile somewheres I wish I could smoke the critter out
Whats Emily say about his goin

She dont say anything She wont talk about him at all and she wont
let me mention his name The poor girl looks as if shed had a hard
night of it but she looks too as if her mind was made up so furs he
was concerned

Captain Obed pulled at his beard

She didnt give him much of a chance last evenin seemed to me he
said If shed only come back when he called after her that time I
callate he was goin to say somethin but she didnt come Wouldnt
answer him at all

Did he call after her I didnt hear him and I dont think she did
When she slammed out of that livinroom she went right up the back
stairs to her bedroom and I chased after her She was cryin or next
door to it and I wanted to comfort her But she wouldnt let me

I see Probably she didnt hear him call at all He did though and
he called her by her first name Matters between em must have gone
furthern we thought they had

Yes I guess thats so Do you know Capn I wouldnt wonder if Mr
Daniels knew that and that was why he was soso nasty to Mr Kendrick
last night Well Im afraid its all off now Emilys awful proud and
shes got a will of her own

Um so I should judge And Johns will aint all mush and molasses
either Thats the worst of young folks I wonder how many good matches
have been broke off just by two young idiots lettin their pride
interfere with their commonsense I wish you and me had a dime for
every one that had you wouldnt have to keep boarders and I wouldnt
have to run sailin parties with codfish passengers

Thats so But Capn Bangs DO you think Mr Kendrick is goin to try
and force me into sellin out just cause his boss says so It dont
seem as if he could Why hehes seemed so grateful for what Ive done
for him He said once I couldnt be kinder if I was his own mother It
dont seem as if he could treat me so just for the money there was in
it But Oh dear as the thought of Mr Solomon Cobb crossed her mind
seems as if some folks would do anything for money

John wouldnt Ive known of his turnin down moren one case there
was money in account of its bein more fishy than honest No if he does
work for thatthat half Holliday cousin of his on this job itll be
because hes took the mans money and feels he cant decently say no
But I dont believe he will No siree I tell you theres a darky in
this kindlin pile Im goin right down to see John this minute

He went but instead of helping the situation he merely made it worse
He found John seated at his office desk apparently engaged in his old
occupation that of looking out of the window The young mans face was
pale and drawn but his manner was perfectly calm

Hello Captain he observed as his caller entered I trust youve
taken the necessary precautions fumigated and all that sort of thing

Fumigated

Why yes Unless Im greatly mistaken this office is destined
to become the den of the moral leper As soon as my respected
fellowtownsmen the majority of them learn that I am to battle with
Heman the Great and in such a cause I shall be shunned and so to
speak spat upon Youre taking big chances by coming here

The captain grunted Umph he sniffed They dont know it yet
neither do I

Ah yes but they will shortly Daniels will take care that they do

John for thunder sakes

Better escape contagion while you can Captain Unclean Unclean

Aw belay John I dont feel like jokin What youve got to tell me
now is that it aint so You aint goin toto try toto

His friend interrupted Captain Bangs he said sharply this is a
practical world we live in You and I have had that preached to us at
least I have and you were present during the sermon I dont know how
you feel of course but henceforth I propose to be the most practical
man you ever saw

Consarn your practicality Are you goin to help thatthat golddust
twinthat cussed relation of yours grab Thankful Barnes house and
land from her

Look here Bangs when thegolddust twin isnt badwhen the twin
offered me the position of his attorney and the blanket retainer along
with it who was it that hesitated concerning my acceptance You I
dont remember that you did Neither didothers But I did accept
becausewell because Now the complications are here and what then

JohnJohn Kendrick if you dast to set there and tell me youre
callatin toyou cant do it You cant be goin to try such a

Oh yes I can I may not succeed but I can try

Captain Obed seldom lost his temper but he lost it now

By the everlastin he roared And this is the young feller that Ive
been holdin up and backin up as all thats fair and above board John
Kendrick do you realize

Easy Captain easy Perhaps I realize what Im doing better than you
do

You dont neither Emily Howes

Johns interruption was sharper now

Thatll do Bangs he said Suppose we omit names

No we wont omit em I tell you you dont realize Youre drivin
that girl right straight to Heman Daniels thats what youre doin

Kendrick smiled I should say there was no driving necessary he
observed Daniels seems to be already the chosen guardian and adviser
I do realize what Im doing Captain and deliberately I shall do
it

John Emily

Hush I like you Captain Obed I dont wish to quarrel with you Take
my advice and omit that young ladys name

Captain Obed made one last appeal

John he pleaded desperately dont I know youre sort ofsort
of tied up to Holliday Kendrick I know you feel that you are But this
aint a question of professional honor and that kind of stuff Its
right and wrong

Is it I think not I was quite willing to discuss the rights and
wrongs but I had nohowever that is past I was informed last night
and in your hearing that the question was to be purely a matter of
legal skillof lawbetween Daniels and myself Very well I am a
lawyer Good morning Captain Bangs

The captain left the office still protesting He was hurt and angry
It was not until later he remembered he had not told Kendrick that Heman
Daniels must have spoken without authority when he declared himself the
chosen representative of Mrs Barnes and Emily in all matters between
the pair and John Heman could not have been given such authority
because according to Thankfuls story she and Miss Howes had
immediately gone upstairs after leaving the livingroom Daniels
could have spoken with them again that evening But when Captain Obed
remembered this it was too late Thankful had asked Mr Daniels to take
her case provided the attempt at ousting her from her property ever
reached legal proceedings And Emily Howes left East Wellmouth two days
later

She had not intended to leave for South Middleboro so soon she had
planned to remain another week before going back to her school duties
But there came a letter from the committee asking her to return as soon
as possible and she suddenly announced her determination to go at once

Thankful at first tried to dissuade her but soon gave up the attempt
It was quite evident that Emily meant to go and equally certain in her
cousins mind that the reason for the sudden departure was the scene
with John Kendrick Emily refused to discuss the latters conduct or to
permit the mention of his name She seemed reluctant even to speak of
the Holliday Kendrick matter although all of East Wellmouth was now
talking of little else When Mrs Barnes driven to desperation begged
her to say what should be done she shook her head

I wish I could tell you Auntie she said but I cant Perhaps you
dont need to do anything yet Mr Daniels says the idea that that man
can force you into selling is ridiculous

I know he does But Im a woman Emily and what I dont know about law
would fill a bigger library than there is in this town by a considerble
sight Its always the woman particularly a widow woman that gets the
worst of it in this kind of thing Id feel better if I knew somebody
was lookin out for me Oh dear if only Mr John Kendrick hadnt

Auntie please

Yes I know But it dont seem as if he could act so to me It dont
seem

Hush It is quite evident he can Dont say any more

Well I wont But what shall I do Shall I put it all in Mr Daniels
hands He says hell be glad to help in fact about everybody thinks he
is helpin I guess Hannah Parker told me

Dont Auntie dont Put it in Mr Daniels hands if you think best
I suppose it is all you can do Yes let Mr Daniels handle it for you

All right Ill tell him you and I have agreed

No Tell him nothing of the sort Dont bring my name into the matter

But Emily you dont think I ought to sell

No No Of course I dont think so If I were you I should fight to the
last ditch I would never give innever Oh Auntie I feel wicked and
mean to leave you now with all this new trouble but I mustI must I
cant stay hereI

There there Emily dear I understand I guess I know how hard it is
for you And I thought so much of him too I thought he was such a fine
young

Aunt Thankful are you daring to hint that IIcare in the least for
thathim How dare you insinuate such a thing to me II despise him

Yes yes hastily Course you do course you do Well we wont worry
about that any of it Mr Daniels says theres nothin to worry about
anyhow and Ill tell him he can do what he thinks ought to be done when
its necessary Now lets finish up that packin of yours dearie

Thankful did not trust herself to accompany her cousin to Wellmouth
Centre She was finding it hard enough to face the coming separation
with outward cheerfulness and the long ride to the railway station
she found to be too great a strain So she made the lameness of George
Washingtons off fore leg an excuse for keeping that personage in the
stable and it was in Winnie Ss depotwagon that Emily journeyed to
the Centre

They said goodby at the front gate Emily too was trying to appear
cheerful and the parting was hurried

Goodby Auntie she said Take care of yourself Write often and I
will answer I promise you I know youll be lonely after Ive gone
but I have a plana secret If I can carry it through you wont be SO
lonely Im pretty sure And dont worry will you The mortgage is all
right and as for the other thingwell that will be all right too You
wont worry will you

No no Ill be too busy to worry And youll come down for the
Christmas vacation You will wont you

Ill try    I mean I will if I can arrange it Goodby dear

The depotwagon rattled out of the yard Winnie S pulled up at the gate
to shout a bit of news

Say Mrs Barnes he yelled we got one of your boarders over to our
place now John Kendricks come there to live Lots of folks are down
on him count of his heavin you over and takin up along with Mr
Holliday but Dad says he dont care about that so longs he pays his
board reglar Git dap Old Hundred

A last wave of Thankfuls hand the answering wave of a handkerchief
from the rear seat of the depotwagon and the parting was over
Thankful went into the house Lonely She had never been more lonely
in her life except when the news of her husbands death was brought
to her The pang of loneliness which followed her brother Jedediahs
departure for the Klondike was as nothing to this She had promised not
to worry and she must keep that promise but there was certainly plenty
to cause worry The mortgage which Emily had so comfortably declared
all right was far from that Solomon Cobb had not been near her since
their interview He had not yet said that he would renew the mortgage
when it fell due Mrs Barnes began to fear that he did not intend to
renew it

Heman Daniels when he came in for supper seemed disturbed to find that
Miss Howes had gone Somehow or other he had gained the impression that
she was to leave the next morning

Did shedid Miss Howes leave no message for me he inquired with a
carelessness which to Thankful seemed more assumed than real

No answered the latter no unless you call it a message about
takin the responsibility of Holliday Kendrick and his schemes off
my hands That is remembering Emilys desire not to have her name
mentioned in the matter she didnt leave that But I guess you can
take charge of that mess if you want to

Mr Daniels smiled a superior smile I intended doing so he said
as a matter of friendship Mrs Barnes You may rest easy I have taken
pains to let the townfolks know that your interests are mine and I
think ourerlateerfriend is learning what our best citizens think
of his attitude

There was truth in this statement John Kendrick had foreseen the effect
upon his popularity which his espousal of his wealthy relatives cause
might have and his prophecy concerning moral leprosy was in process of
fulfillment Opinion in the village was divided of course There were
some who like Darius Holt announced that they did not blame the young
yellow E Holliday had money and influence and as a business man his
attorney would be a fool not to stick by the cashbox But there were
others and these leading citizens and hitherto good friends who openly
expressed disgust both with the rich man and his lawyer Several of
these citizens called upon Thankful to tell her of their sympathy and of
their wish to help her in any way

Not that youre liable to need help said one caller This propertys
yours and even John D himself couldnt get it from you unless you were
willin But its a dirty trick just the same and young Kendrick that
all hands thought was so straight and honest takin part in it is the
dirtiest thing in it Well hes hurt himself moren he has anybody
else

Captain Obed Bangs was a gloomy man that fall He had always liked John
and the liking had grown to an ardent admiration and affection He made
several attempts to speak with the young man on the subject but the
latter would not discuss it He was always glad to see the captain and
quite willing to talk of anything but Mrs Barnes property and of Emily
Howes These topics were taboo and Captain Obed soon ceased to mention
them Also he no longer made daily calls at the exbarbershop and
in spite of himself could not help showing when he did call the
resentment he felt John noticed this and there was a growing coldness
between the two

But declared the captain stoutly when he and Thankful were
together I still say taint so I give in that it looks as if twas
but I tell you theres a nigger in the woodpile somewheres Some day
hell be dug out and then theres a heap of tattletales and character
naggers in this town thatll find theyve took the wrong channel
Theyll be good and seasick thats what theyll be

Mr E Holliday Kendrick if he knew that his own popularity had
suffered a shock did not appear to care He went on with his plans
for enlarging his estate and when he left East Wellmouth for New York
which he did early in October told those who asked him that he had
left the purchase of the boardinghouse nuisance in the hands of his
attorney I shall have that property he announced emphatically I
may not get it for some time but I shall get it I make it a point to
get what I go after

Emily in her letters those written soon after her arrival in South
Middleboro said nothing concerning her plan the secret which was to
cheer Mrs Barnes loneliness Thankful could not help wondering what
the secret might be but in her own letters she asked no questions And
one day in midOctober that secret was divulged

Thankful busy in the kitchen with Imogene preparing dinner heard the
sound of wheels and horses hoofs in the yard Going to the door she
was surprised to see Captain Obed Bangs climbing from a buggy The buggy
was her own and the horse to which it was attached was her own George
Washington Upon the seat of the buggy was a small boy Thankful merely
glanced at the boy her interest just then centered upon the fact that
the captain was or apparently had been using her horse and buggy
without her knowledge or consent She certainly had no objection to his
so using it but it was most unlike him to do so

Good mornin maam he hailed cheerfully His eyes were twinkling
and he appeared to be in high good humor

Why good mornin Capn said Thankful Iyouyoure goin
somewhere I should judge

The captain shook his head No he replied Ive been Had an errand
up to the Centre I knew somethin was comin on the mornin train so I
drove up to fetch it Thought you wouldnt mind my usin your horse and
buggy Imogene knew I was usin it

Thankful was surprised She did she repeated Thats funny She
didnt say a word to me

No I told her not to You see thethe somethin I was expectin was
for you so I thought wed make it a little surprise EmilyMiss Howes
she sent it

Emilysent somethin to me

Yup

For the land sakes Well after a moment did it come Where is it

Oh yes it came Its right there in the buggy Dont you see it

Thankful looked at the buggy The only thing in it so far as she could
see was the little boy on the seat The little boy grinned

Hello Aunt Thankful he said Ive come to stay with you I have

Thankful started stared and then made a rush for the buggy

Georgie Hobbs she cried You blessed little scamp Come here to me
this minute Well well well

Georgie came and was received with a bear hug and a shower of kisses

Well well repeated Thankful And to think I didnt know you Im
ashamed of myself And youre the surprise I suppose You ARE one sure
and sartin How did you get here

I came on the cars declared Georgie proudly Ma and Emmie put me on
em and told me to sit right still until I got to Wellmouth Centre and
then get off And I did too didnt I MrI mean Captain Bangs

You bet you did agreed the delighted captain Thats some relation
youve got there Mrs Barnes Hes little but Oh my He and I have had
a good talk on the way down We got along fustrate hey commodore The
commodores agreed to ship secondmate along with me next vyage I make
if I ever make one

Thankful held her relationhe was Emilys halfbrother and her own
favorite next to Emily herself in that familyat arms length You
blessed littlelittle mite she exclaimed So you come way down here
all alone just to see your old auntie Did you ever in your life And I
suppose youre the secret Emily said she had the one that was to keep
me from bein lonesome

Georgie nodded Yes he said Emmie shes wrote you all about me
Ive got the letter pinned inside of me here patting his small chest
And Im goin to stay ever so long I am I want to see the pig and the
hens and theand the orphan and everything

So you shall declared Thankful Im glad enough to see you to turn
the house inside out if you wanted to look at it And you knew all about
this I suppose turning to Captain Obed

The captain laughed aloud

Sartin I did he said Miss Howes and I have been writin each other
like a couple of courtin young folks I knew the commodore was goin
to set sail today and I was on hand up to the depot to man the yards
Forgive me for hookin your horse and buggy will you Mrs Thankful

Forgiveness was granted Thankful would have forgiven almost anything
just then The commodore announced that he was hungry and he was
hurried into the house The cares of travel had not taken away his
appetite He was introduced to Imogene at whom he stared fixedly for
a minute or more and then asked if she was the orphan When told that
she was he asked if her mamma and papa were truly dead Imogene said she
guessed they were Then Georgie asked why and after then what made
them that way adding the information that he had a kitty that went dead
one time and wasnt any good any more

The coming of the commodore brought a new touch of life to the High
Cliff House which had settled down for its winter nap Thankful of
course read Emilys letter at the first opportunity Emily wrote that
she felt sure Georgie would be company for her cousin and that she had
conceived the idea of the boys visit before leaving East Wellmouth but
had said nothing because she was not sure mother would consent But that
consent had been granted and Georgie might stay until Christmas perhaps
even after that if he was not too great a care

He was something of a care there was no doubt of that Imogene whom he
liked and who liked him declared that that young one had more jump in
him than a sand flea The very afternoon of his arrival he frightened
the hens into shrieking hysterics poked the fat and somnolent Patrick
Henry the pig with a sharp stick to see if he was alive and not gone
dead like the kitten and barked his shins and nose by falling out of
the wheelbarrow in the barn Kenelm who still retained his position at
the High Cliff House and was meek and lowly under the double domination
of his fiancee and his sister was inclined to grumble A feller cant
set down to rest a minute declared Kenelm without that young ones
jumpin out at him from behind somethin or nother and hollerin
Boo Seems to like to scare me into a fit Picks on me wuss than
Hannah he does

But even Kenelm confessed to a liking for the pesky little nuisance
Captain Obed idolized him and took him on excursions along the beach
or to his own fishhouses where Georgie sat on a heap of nets and came
home smelling strongly of cod but filled to the brim with sea yarns
And Thankful found in the boy the one comfort and solace for her
increasing troubles and cares Altogether the commodore was in a fair
way to become a thoroughly spoiled officer

With November came the rains again and compared with them those of
early September seemed but showers Day after day and night after night
the wind blew and the water splashed against the windows and poured from
the overflowing gutters Patrick Henry the pig found his quarters
in the new pen in the hollow behind the barn the center of the flood
zone and being discovered one morning marooned on a swampy islet in the
middle of a muddy lake was transferred to the old sty that built by
the late Mr Laban Eldredge beneath the woodshed and adjoining the
potato cellar Thankfuls orderly neat soul rebelled against having
a pig under the house but as she expressed it twas either that or
havin the critter two foot under water

Captain Obed like every citizen of East Wellmouth was disgusted with
the weather I was callatin to put in my spare time down to the
shanty buildin a new dory he said but I guess now Ill build an ark
instead If this downpour keeps on Ill need one bad as Noah ever did

Heman Daniels Miss Timpson and Caleb Hammond were now the only boarders
and roomers Mrs Barnes had left to provide for There was little or no
profit in providing for them for the rates paid by the two last named
were not high and their demands were at times almost unreasonable Miss
Timpson had a new idea now that of giving up the room she had occupied
since coming to the Barnes boardinghouse and moving her belongings into
the suite at the rear of the second floor that comprising the large
room and the little back bedroom adjoining the latter the scene of
Thankfuls spooky adventure on the first night of her arrival in East
Wellmouth These rooms ordinarily rented for much more than Miss Timpson
had paid for her former apartment but she had no thought of paying more
for them Of course I shouldnt expect to get em for the same if twas
summer she explained to Thankful but just now with em standin
empty I might as well move there as not I know youll be glad to have
me wont you Mrs Barnes you and me being such good friends by this
time

And Thankful although conscious of an injustice somewhere did not like
to refuse her good friend So she consented and Miss Timpson moved
into the back rooms But she no sooner had her trunks carried there
than she was struck by another brilliant idea Thankful hearing unusual
sounds from above that Saturday morning ascended the back stairs to
find the school mistress tugging at the bureau which she was apparently
trying to drag from the small room into the larger

It came to me all of a sudden panted Miss Timpson who was out of
breath but enthusiastic That little rooms awful small and stuffy
to sleep in and I do hate to sleep in a stuffy room But when I was
standing there sniffing and looking it came to me

What came to you demanded the puzzled Thankful What are you talkin
aboutthe bureau

No no The idea The bureau couldnt come to me by itself could
it No the idea came to me That little room isnt good for much as a
bedroom but it will make the loveliest study I can put my table and
my books in there and move the bed and things in here Then Ill have a
beautiful nice big bedroom and the cutest little study And Ive always
wanted a study Now if you and Imogene help me with the bureau and bed
itll be all fixed

So Imogene assisted by Kenelm who was drafted in Thankfuls place
spent a good part of the afternoon shifting furniture and arranging
the bedroom and the study Miss Timpson superintended and as she was
seldom satisfied until each separate item of the suites equipment had
been changed about at least twice in order to get the effect all
three were nervous and tired when the shifting was over Miss Timpson
should have been happy over the attainment of the study but instead she
appeared gloomy and downcast

I declare she said as she and Thankful sat together in the
livingroom that evening I dont knows Ive done right after all I
dont knows I wish I had stayed right where I was

Mercy on us Why demanded Thankful a trifle impatiently

Oh I dont know Maybe cause Im kind of tired and nervous tonight
I feel as ifas if something was going to happen to me I wonder if I
could have another cup of tea before I went to bed it might settle my
nerves you know

Considering that the lady had drunk three cups of tea at supper Mrs
Barnes could not help feeling doubtful concerning the soothing effect of
a fourth But she prepared it and brought it into the livingroom Miss
Timpson sipped the tea and groaned

Do you ever have presentiments Mrs Barnes she asked

Have what

Presentiments Warnings you know Ive had several in my life and they
have always come to something I feel as if I was going to have one
now Heavens Hear that wind and rain Dont they sound like somebody
callingcalling

No they dont They sound cold and wet thats all Dear me I never
saw such a spell of weather I thought this mornin twas goin to
clear but now its come on again hard as ever

Well with dismal resignation well all go when our time comes I
suppose Were here today and gone tomorrow I dont suppose theres any
use setting and worrying Be prepared thats the main thing Have you
bought a cemetery lot Mrs Barnes You ought to everybody had We
cant tell when were liable to need a grave

Goodness gracious sakes Dont talk about cemetery lots and graves
You give me the blue creeps Go to bed and rest up Youre tired and no
wonder youve moved no lessn three times since mornin and they
say one movins as bad as a fire Here Give me that teacup Theres
nothin left in it but grounds and you dont want to drink THEM

Miss Timpson relinquished the cup took her lamp and climbed the stairs
Her good night was as mournful as a funeral march Thankful left alone
tried to read for a time but the wailing wind and squeaking shutters
made her nervous and depressed so after putting the key under the mat
of the side door for Heman Daniels who was out attending a meeting of
the Masonic Lodge she too retired

It was not raining when she awoke but the morning was gray and cloudy
She came downstairs early so earlyfor it was Sunday morning when
all East Wellmouth lies abedthat she expected to find no one not even
Imogene astir But to her great surprise Miss Timpson was seated by
the livingroom stove

Land sakes exclaimed Thankful Are you up Whats the matter

Miss Timpson who had started violently when Mrs Barnes entered turned
toward the latter a face as white so Thankful described it afterward
as unbleached muslin This was not a bad simile for Miss Timpsons
complexion was owing to her excessive teadrinking a decided yellow
Just now it was a very pale yellow

Who is it she gasped Oh its you Mrs Barnes It IS you isnt
it

Me Of course its me Have I changed so much in the night that you
dont know me What is it Miss Timpson Are you sick Can I get you
anything

No no I aint sickin body anyway And nobody can get me anything
this side of the grave Mrs Barnes Im going

Youre GOIN What You dont mean youre dyin

Considering her lodgers remarks of the previous evening those relating
to going when the time came it is no wonder Thankful was alarmed But
Miss Timpson shook her head

No she said I dont mean that not yet though thatll come next
I feel it coming already No Mrs Barnes I dont mean that I mean Im
going away I cant live here any longer

Thankful collapsed upon a chair

Goin she repeated Youre goin to leave here Whywhy youve just
fixed up to stay

Miss Timpson groaned I know she wailed I thought I had but
IIve changed my mind Im going to leavenow

By way of proof she pointed to her travelingbag which was beside her
on the floor Mrs Barnes had not noticed the bag before but now she
saw that it was apparently packed

My trunks aint ready yet went on the schoolmistress I tried to
pack em butbut I couldnt I couldnt bear to do it alone Maybe you
or Imogene will help me by and by Oh my soul What was that

What I didnt hear anything

Didnt you Well perhaps I didnt either Its just my nerves I
guess Mrs Barnes could you help me pack those trunks pretty soon Im
going away I must go If I stay in this house any longer I shall DIE

She was trembling and wringing her hands Thankful tried to comfort
her and did succeed in quieting her somewhat but in spite of her
questionings and pleadings Miss Timpson refused to reveal the cause of
her agitation or of her sudden determination to leave the High Cliff
House

It aint anything youve done or havent done Mrs Barnes she said
I like it here and I like the board and I like you But I must go Im
going to my cousins down in the village first and after that I dont
know where Ill go Please dont ask me any more

She ate a few mouthfuls of the breakfast which Thankful hastily prepared
for her and then she departed for her cousins Thankful begged her to
stay until Kenelm came when he might harness the horse and drive her
to her destination but she would not wait She would not even remain to
pack her trunks

Ill come back and pack em she said Or perhaps you and Imogene
will pack em for me Oh Mrs Barnes youve been so kind I hate to
leave you this way I do honest

But WHY are you leavin asked Thankful once more For the first time
Miss Timpson seemed to hesitate She looked about as if to make sure
that the two were alone then she leaned forward and whispered in her
companions ear

Mrs Barnes she whispered II didnt mean to tell you I didnt
mean to tell anybody Twas too personal too sacred a thing to tell
But I dont knows I shant tell you after all seems as if I must tell
somebody Mrs Barnes I shant live much longer Ive had a warning

Thankful stared at her

Rebecca Timpson she exclaimed Have you gone crazy What are you
talkin about A warnin

Yes a warning I was warned last night Youyou knew I was a twin
didnt you

A which

A twin Probably you didnt know it but I used to have a twin sister
Medora that died when she was only nineteen She and I looked alike
and were alike in most everything We thought the world of each other
used to be together daytimes and sleep together nights And she used
toerwell she was different from me in one wayshe couldnt help
it poor thingshe used to snore something dreadful I used to scold
her for it poor soul Manys the time Ive reproached myself since
but

For mercy sakes whats your sisters snorin got to do with

Hush Mrs Barnes with intense solemnity As sure as you and I live
and breathe this minute my sister Medora came to me last night

CAME to you Whyyou mean you dreamed about her dont you Theres
nothin strange in that When you took that fourth cup of tea I said to
myself

HUSH Oh hush DONT talk so I didnt dream Mrs Barnes I woke up
at two oclock this morning andand I heard Medora snoring as plain as
I ever heard anything

Thankful was strongly tempted to laugh but the expression on Miss
Timpsons face was so deadly serious that she refrained

Goodness she exclaimed Is that all Thats nothin A night like
last night with the rain and the blinds and the wind

Hush It wasnt the wind Dont you suppose I know I thought it was
the wind or my imagination at first But I laid there and listened and I
kept hearing it Finally I got up and lit my lamp and still I heard it
It was snoring and it didnt come from the room I was in It came from
the little back room Id made into a study

Thankfuls smile faded She was conscious of a curious prickling at
the roots of her black hair The back bedroom The room in which Laban
Eldredge died The room in which she herself had heard

I went into that room continued Miss Timpson I dont know how I
ever did it but I did I looked everywhere but there was nobody there
not a sign of anybody And still that dreadful snoring kept on and on
And then I realized with a shudder I realized what I hadnt noticed
before that room was exactly the size and shape of the one Medora and
I used to sleep in Mrs Barnes it was Medoras spirit that had come to
me Do you wonder I cant stay here any longer

Thankful fought with her feelings She put a hand on the back of her
neck and rubbed vigorously Nonsense she declared bravely You
imagined it Nonsense Whoever heard of a snorin ghost

But Miss Timpson only shook her head Goodby Thankful she said I
shant tell anybody as I said I didnt mean to tell you Ifif you
hear that anythings happened to mehappened sudden you knowyoull
understand You can tell Imogene and Mr Daniels and Mr Hammond that
Ithat Ive gone visiting to my cousin Sarahs Thatll be true
anyway Goodby You MAY see me again in this life but I doubt it

She hurried away along the path Thankful reentered the house and stood
in the middle of the kitchen floor thinking Then she walked steadily
to the foot of the back stairs ascended them and walked straight
to the apartments so recently occupied by the schoolmistress Miss
Timpsons trunks were there and the greater part of her belongings Mrs
Barnes did not stop to look at these She crossed the larger room and
entered the little back bedroom

The clouds were breaking and the light of the November sun shone in The
little room was almost cheerful There were no sounds except those from
without the neigh of George Washington from his stall the cackle of
the hens the hungry grunts of Patrick Henry the pig in his sty beside
the kitchen

Thankful looked and listened Then she made a careful examination of the
room but found nothing mysterious or out of the ordinary And yet there
was a mystery there She had long since decided that her own experience
in that room had been imagination but now that conviction was shaken
Miss Timpson must have heard something she HAD heard something which
frightened her into leaving the boardinghouse she professed to like so
well Ghost or no ghost Miss Timpson had gone and one more source of
income upon which Mrs Barnes had depended went with her Slowly and
with the feeling that not only this world but the next was conspiring to
bring about the failure of her enterprise and the ruin of her plans and
her hopes Thankful descended the stairs to the kitchen and set about
preparing breakfast




CHAPTER XII


Mr Caleb Hammond rose that Sunday morning with a partially developed
attack of indigestion and a thoroughly developed grouch
The indigestion was due to an injudicious partaking of light
refreshmentsandwiches ice cream and sarsaparilla tonicat the
club the previous evening Simeon Baker had paid for the refreshment
ordering the supplies sent in from Mr Chris Badgers store Simeon had
received an unexpected high price for cranberries shipped to New York
and was in consequence flush and reckless He appeared at the club at
ninethirty after most of its married members had departed for their
homes and only a few of the younger set and one or two bachelors like
Mr Hammond remained and announced that he was going to blow the
crowd The crowd was quite willing to be blown and said so

Mr Hammond ate three sandwiches and two plates of ice cream also he
smoked two cigars He did not really feel the need of the second cream
or the second cigar but as they were furnished without cost to him he
took them as a matter of principle Hence the indigestion

The grouch was due partially to the unwonted dissipation and its
consequences and partly to the fact that his winter flannels had not
been returned by Mrs Melinda Pease to whom they had been consigned for
mending and overhauling

It was the tenth of November and for a period of twentyfour years ever
since his recovery from a severe attack of rheumatic fever Caleb had
made it a point to lay aside his summer underwear on the morning of
November tenth and don a heavy suit Weather cold or warm was not
supposed to have any bearing on this change The ninth might be as
frigid as a Greenland twilight and the tenth as balmy as a Florida
noonno matter on the ninth Mr Hammond wore light underwear and
shivered on the tenth he wore his flannels and perspired It was
another of his principles and Caleb had a deserved reputation for
adhering to principle and being sot in his ways

So when on this particular tenth of November this Sabbath morning
he rose conscious of the sandwiches and tonic and found no suit of
flannels ready for him to don his grouch began to develop He opened
his chamber door a crack and shouted through the crack

Mrs Barnes he called Hii Mrs Barnes

Thankful still busy in the kitchen where she had been joined by
Imogene sent the latter to find out what was the matter Imogene
returned grinning

He wants his flannels she announced Wants to know where them winter
flannels Mrs Pease sent home yesterday are Why aint they in his
room he says

Thankful sniffed Her experience with Miss Timpson and the worry caused
by the latters leaving had had their effect upon her patience

Mercy sakes she exclaimed Is that all I thought the house was
afire I dont know where his flannels are Why should I Whered
Melindy put em when she brought em here

Imogene chuckled I dont think she brought em at all she replied
She want here yesterday Shewhy yes seems to me Kenelm said he
heard she was sick abed with a cold

Thankful nodded So she is she said Probably the poor thing aint
had time to finish mendin em Its a good deal of a job I guess She
told me once that that Hammond man wore his inside clothes till they
want anything BUT mendin just hung together with patches as you
might say His suits and overcoats are all right enough most always
but he cant seem to bear to spend money for anything underneath
Perhaps he figgers that patches are good as anything else longs they
dont show Imogene go tell him Melindy didnt fetch em

Imogene went and returned with her grin broader than ever

He says she did bring em she announced Says she always brings him
his things on the ninth Hes pretty peppery this mornin seems to me
Says he dont callate to stand there and freeze much longer

Freeze Why its the warmest day weve had for a fortnit The suns
come out and its cleared up fine like Indian summer Oh DO be still
as another shout for Mrs Barnes came from above Here never mind
Imogene Ill tell him

She went into the front hall and called up the stairs

Your things aint here Mr Hammond she said Melindy didnt bring
em Shes laid up with a cold and probably couldnt get em ready

Course shes got em ready She always has em ready She knows I want
em

Maybe so but she aint always sick taint likely They aint here
anyway You wont need em today

Need em Course I need em Its colder than Christmas

No it isnt Its almost as warm as September Put on two suits of
your others if youre so cold And come down to breakfast as soon as
you can Weve all had ours

When Mr Hammond did come down to breakfast his manner was that of a
martyr The breakfast itself baked beans and fishballs did not appeal
to him and he ate little He grumbled as he drank his coffee

Healthy note this is he muttered Got to set around and freeze to
death just cause that lazy critter aint finished her job I pay her
for it dont I

Thankful sniffed I suppose you do she said adding under her breath
though how much you pay is another thing

Is this all the breakfast youve got queried Caleb

Why yes its what we always have Sunday mornins Isnt it what you
expected

Oh I expected it all right Take it away I dont want no more
Consarn it I wish sometimes I had a home of my own

Well why dont you have one I should think you would You can afford
it

Mr Hammond did not reply He folded his napkin seized his hat and coat
and went out When he crossed the threshold he shivered as a matter of
principle

He stalked gloomily along the path by the edge of the bluff Captain
Obed Bangs came up the path and they met

Hello Caleb hailed the captain Fine weather at last eh Almost
like August Injun summer at last I callate What you got your coat
collar turned up for Afraid of getting your neck sunburned

Mr Hammond grunted and hurried on Captain Obed had chosen a poor topic
if he desired a lengthy conversation

Mrs Pease lived at the farther end of the village and when Caleb
reached there he was met by the ladys niece Emma Snow

Aunt Melindys real poorly said Emma Shes been so for most three
days Im stayin here with her till she gets better No she aint had
time to do your mendin yet Anyhow its so nice and warm you dont need
the things thats a comfort

It may have been a comfort to her but it was not to Caleb He growled
a reply and turned on his heel The churchgoers along the main road
received scanty acknowledgment of their greetings

Aint you comin to meetin asked Abbie Larkin

Naw snarled Caleb I aint

Why not And its such a lovely day too

Ugh

Why aint you comin to meetin Mr Hammond

Cause I dont feel like it thats why

I want to know Well you DONT seem to be in a pious frame of mind
thats a fact Better come you may not feel like church but I should
say you needed it if ever anybody did

Caleb did not deign a reply He stalked across the road and took the
path to the shore

As he came opposite the Parker cottage he saw Hannah Parker at the
window He nodded and his nod was returned Hannahs experience was as
gloomy as his own She did not look happy and somehow the idea that she
was not happy pleased him Abbie Larkin had been altogether too happy
it grated on him He was miserable and he wanted company of his own
kind He stopped hesitated and then turned in at the Parker gate

Hannah opened the door

Good mornin Caleb she said Come in wont you It looks sort of
chilly outdoor

This WAS a kindred spirit Mr Hammond entered the Parker sittingroom
Hannah motioned toward a chair and he sat down

Mornin Hannah said Caleb Tis chilly Itll be a mercy if we
dont catch our deaths dressed the way some of us be Hows things with
you

Miss Parker shook her head Oh I dont know Caleb she answered
They aint all they might be Im afraid

Whats the matter Aint you feelin up to the mark

Oh yesyes Im feeling well enough in body I aint sick if thats
what you mean Im kind of blue andand lonesome thats all I try to
bear up under my burdens but I get compressed in spirit sometimes I
cant help it Ah hum a day

She sighed and Mr Hammond sighed also

You aint the only one he said Im bluern a whetstone myself this
mornin

Whats the trouble

Trouble Trouble enough Somethin happened this mornin that riled me
all up It he paused remembering that the cause of the rilin was
somewhat personal not to say delicate Wellwell never mind what it
was he added Twas mighty aggravatin thats all Ive got to say

Hannah sighed again Ah hum she observed Theres aggravations
enough in this life And they generally come on account of somebody
else too Theres times when I wish I didnt have any flesh and blood

Hey Good land No flesh and blood What do you wantbones

Oh I dont mean that I wish I didnt have anyany relations of my
own flesh and blood

Humph I dont knows youd be any better off I aint got nobody and
I aint what you might call cheerful I know whats the matter with you
though That Kenelms been frettin you again I suppose

He had guessed it Kenelm that morning had suddenly announced that he
was to have a day off He was callatin to borrow Mrs Barnes horse
and buggy and go for a ride His sister promptly declared that would be
lovely she was just wishing for a ride Whereupon Kenelm had hemmed and
hawed and at last admitted that his company for the drive was already
provided

Oh sneered Hannah I see Youre goin to take that precious inmate
of yours along And Ive got to set here alone at home Well I should
think youd be ASHAMED

What for Aint nothin in takin a lady youre keepin company with
out drivin is there I dont see no shame in that

No I presume likely YOU dont Youre way past shame both of you And
when I think of all Ive done for you Slaved and cooked your meals

Well youre cookin em yet aint you I aint asked you to stop

I will stop though I will

All right then heave ahead and stop I callate my wifell be willin
to cook for me if its needful

Your wife She aint your wife yet And she shant be This ridiculous
engaged business of yours isis

Well if you dont like the engagin why dont you stop it

Why dont YOU stop it you mean You would if you had the feelins of a
man

Humph And let some everlastin lawyer sue me out of my last cent for
damages All right Ill stop it if you say so Theres plenty of room
in the poorhouse they tell me Howd you like to give us this place and
move to the poorhouse Hannah

Butbut O Kenelm I cant think of your gettin married I cant
think of it

Dont think of it I aint thinkin of it no moren I can help Why
aint you satisfied with things as they be Everythings goin on all
right enough now aint it You and me are livin together same as we
have for ever so long Youre here and Iwell I

He did not finish the sentence but his sister read his thought She
knew perfectly well that her brother was finding a measure of enjoyment
in the situation so far as his dealings with her were concerned He was
more independent than he had been since she took him in charge But she
realized too her own impotence She could not drive him too hard or
he might be driven into marrying Imogene And THAT Hannah was determined
should be deferred as long as possible

So she said no more concerning the ride and merely showed her feelings
by moping in the corner and wiping her eyes with her handkerchief
whenever he looked in her direction After he had gone she spent the
halfhour previous to Mr Hammonds arrival in alternate fits of rage
and despair

So Kenelms been actin unlikely has he queried Caleb Well if
he was my brother hed soon come to time quick or be put to bed in a
hospital Thats what would happen to HIM

Miss Parker looked as if the hospital picture was more appealing than
dreadful

I wish he was your brother she said Or I wish I was independent and
had a house of my own

Huh Gosh So do I wish I had one Ive been wishin it all the
mornin If I had a home of my own Id have what I wanted to eatyes
and wear And Id have em when I wanted em too

Dont they give you good things to eat over at Mrs Barnes

Oh theyre good enough maybe if theyre what you want But boardins
boardin taint like your own home

Caleb its a wonder to me you dont rent a little house and live in
it Youve got money enough least so everybody says

Humph What everybody says is most generally lies What would be the
sense of my hirin a house Id have to have a housekeeper and a good
one costs like thunder A fellers wife has to get along on what he
gives her but a housekeeper

He stopped short seemingly struck by a new and amazing idea Miss
Parker rambled on about the old days when dear papa was alive
how happy she was then and so on with occasional recourse to the
handkerchief Suddenly Caleb slapped his knee

Its all right he said Its fineand its commonsense too
Hannah whats the matter with you and me gettin married

Hannah stared at him

Married she repeated Me get married Who to for the land sakes
Are you out of your head

Not a mite Whats the matter with you marryin me

My soul Is this a funnypaper joke or are you

Taint a joke I mean it Is there any reason why we shouldnt marry
and settle down together you and me I dont see none You could keep
house for me then and twouldnt costthat is you could look out for
me and Iwell I suppose likely I could look out for you too Why
not

Why how you talk Caleb Hammond

No I dont talk neither I mean it You was wishin for a home of your
own so was I Lets have one together

Well I swan Get married at ourat our age I never did hear such
talk Wed be a nice young bride and groom wouldnt we I guess East
Wellmouth folks would have somethin to laugh at then

Let em laugh Laughin dont cost nothin and if it does we wont
have to pay for it See here Hannah this aint any foolish frontgate
courtin this aint Its just commonsense business Lets do it I
will if you will

Miss Parker shook her head The prospect of being Mrs Caleb Hammond
was not too alluring Calebs reputation as a husband was not while
his wife lived that of a liberal provider And yet this was Hannahs
first proposal and it had come years after she had given up hoping for
one So she prolonged the delicious moment as long as possible

I suppose youre thinkin about that brother of yours suggested Mr
Hammond Well hell be all right Cordin to what Ive heard and
seen myself hes hangin around that hired help girl at the High Cliff
pretty reglar these days Maybe hell marry her and youll be left
without anybody If he dont marry her he can come to live along of
usmaybe If he does hell mind his ps and qs I tell you that Hell
find out whos boss

This speech had an effect For the first time Hannahs determination
wavered Kenelm was although Caleb did not know it actually engaged to
marry Imogene His sister was even then writhing under the humiliation
And here was an opportunity to get even not only with Kenelm but with
the inmate If she Hannah were to marry and leave the pair instead
of being herself left Oh the glory of itthe triumphant glory of it
How she could crush her brother How she could gloat over and sneer
at Imogene The things she might sayshe the wife of a rich man Oh
wonderful

Well come on Hannah come on urged the impatient Caleb What do
you say

But Miss Parker still shook her head It aint any use Caleb she
declared Even ifif I wanted to how could I tell Kenelm Hed raise
an awful fuss Hed tell everybody and they

No he wouldnt Id break his neck if he did    Andeh as
another idea came to him he neednt know till twas all over We
could get married right off now and not tell a soulKenelm or anybody
elsetill it was done Then they could talk or shut up we wouldnt
care They couldnt change nothin

Caleb Hammond do you suppose Id have the face to go to a minister
in this town and have you tell him wed come to get married Id be so
ashamed

Hold on We dont have to go to a minister in this town Theres other
towns with parsons in them aint they We could drive over somewheres
else

Everybodyd see us drivin together

What of it They see us drivin to the Cattle Show together didnt
they

Yes and theyve talked about it ever since some of em That Abbie
Larkin saidOh I cant tell you what she said No I shant do it
I shouldnt have the face And everybodyd ask where we was bound
and IdId be soso mortified andandwhy Id act like a
reglarererdomicile that had run away from the Idiots Home No
no no I couldnt

Mr Hammond thought it over Then he said

See here Hannah I callate we can fix that Well start in the night
after all hands have gone to bed Ill sneak out about quarter to twelve
and borrow Thankfuls horse and buggy out of her barn I know where she
keeps the key Ill be ready here at twelve promptor not here maybe
but down in the hollow back of your henhouse You must be there and
well drive over to Trumet

Trumet Why Caleb Hammond I know everybody in Trumet wells I do
here And gettin to Trumet at three oclock in the mornin would be

Then we wont go to Trumet Well go to Bayport Its quite a trip but
thats all the better cause we wont make Bayport till daylight Then
well hunt up a parson to marry us and come back here and tell folks
when we get good and ready Thankfulll miss the horse and team
I callate but Ill fix that Ill leave a note sayin I took the
critter bein called away on business

Yes but what will I tell Kenelm

Dont tell him anything the foolhead Why yes you can leave a note
sayin youve gone up to the village to the store or somethin and
that he must get his own breakfast cause you wont be back till after
hes gone to work over to Thankfuls Thatll fix it By crimus Thatll
fix it fine Look here Hannah Parker Ive set out to do this and by
crimus Im goin to do it Come on now lets

Caleb was as has been said sot in his ways He was sot now and
although Hannah continued to protest and declare she could not do such
a thing she yielded at last Mr Hammond left the Parker cottage in
a triumphant mood He had won his point and that had pleased him for a
time then as he began to ponder upon that point and its consequences
his triumph changed to misgiving and doubt He had had no idea until
that forenoon of marrying again His proposal had been made on impulse
on the spur of the moment He was not sure that he wished to marry
Hannah Parker But he had pleaded and persuaded her into accepting him
that very night Even if he wished to back out how could henow He
was conscious of an uneasy feeling that perhaps he had made a fool of
himself

He went to his room early in the evening and stayed there looking at
his watch and waiting for the rest of the family to retire He heard
Georgies voice in the room at the end of the hall where Mrs Barnes
was tucking the youngster in for the night Later he heard Imogene come
up the backstairs and after her Thankful herself But it was nearly
eleven before Heman Daniels important and dignified step sounded on the
front stairs and by that time the Hammond nerves were as taut as banjo
strings

It was nearly twelve before he dared creep downstairs and out of the
back door the key of which he left in the lock Luckily the barn was
a good distance from the house and Mrs Barnes and Imogene were sound
sleepers But even with those advantages he did not dare attempt
getting the buggy out of the barn and decided to use the old discarded
carryall relic of Capn Abner which now stood under the open shed at
the rear

George Washington looked at him in sleepy wonder as he tiptoed into
the barn and lit the lantern To be led out of his stall at midnights
solemn hour and harnessed was more than Georges equine reasoning could
fathom The harnessing was a weird and wonderful operation Calebs
trembling fingers were all thumbs After a while however the
harnessing was accomplished somehow and in some way although whether
the breeching was where the bridle should have been or vice versa was
more than the harnesser would have dared swear After several centuries
as the prospective bridegroom was reckoning time the horse was between
the shafts of the carriage and driven very carefully along the road to
the Parker homestead

He hitched the sleepy animal to a pine tree just off the road and
tiptoed toward the hollow the appointed rendezvous To reach this
hollow he was obliged to pass through the Parker yard and although he
went on tiptoe each footstep sounded in his ears like the crack of
doom He tried to think of some explanation to be made to Kenelm in case
the latter should hear and hail him but he could think of nothing
more plausible than that he was taking a walk and this was far from
satisfactory

And then he was hailed From a window above at the extreme end of the
kitchen came a trembling whisper

Caleb Caleb Hammond is that you

Mr Hammonds heart which had been thumping anything but a wedding
march beneath the summer underflannels leaped up and stuck in his
throat but he choked it down and gasped a faint affirmative

Oh my soul and body Where HAVE you been Ive been waitin and
waitin

What in time did you wait up there for Why dont you come down

I cant Kenelms locked the doors and the keys are right next to his
room door I cant get down

Here was an unexpected obstacle Caleb was nonplused

Go home wailed the voice from above Dont stand there Go HOME
Cant you SEE it aint any use Go HOME

Five minutes before he received this order Mr Hammond would have been
only too glad to go home Now he was startled and angry and being
angry his habitual stubbornness developed

I shant go home neither he whispered fiercely If you cant come
down IllIll come up and get you

Shhshh Hell hear you Kenelmll hear you

I dont care much if he does See here Hannah cant you get down
nohow How about that window Cant you climb out of that window Say
didnt I see a ladder layin alongside the woodshed this mornin

Yes theres a ladder there butwhere are you goin Mr
HammondCaleb

But Caleb was on his way to the woodshed He found the ladder and
laboriously dragged it beneath the window Kenelm Parker had a local
reputation for sleeping like the dead Otherwise Mr Hammond would never
have dared risk the noise he was making

Even after the ladder had been placed in position Miss Parker
hesitated At first she flatly refused to descend asserting that no
mortal power could get her down that thing alive But Caleb begged and
commanded in agonized whispers and finally she was prevailed upon to
try Mr Hammond grasped the lower end of the ladder with a grip that
brought the perspiration out upon his forehead and the lady with
suppressed screams and ejaculations of Oh good Lord and Heavens and
earth What shall I do reached the ground safe and more or less sound
They left the ladder where it was and tiptoed fearfully out to the
lane

Whew panted the exhausted swain mopping his brow Im clean
tuckered out I aint done so much work for ten years

Dont say a word Caleb Hammond If I aint got my death ofof ammonia
or somethin I miss my guess Im all wheezed up from settin at that
open winder waitin for you to come and I thought you never WOULD
come

As Caleb was helping the lady of his choice into the carryall he noticed
that she carried a small handbag

What you got that thing for he demanded

Its my reticule theres a clean handkerchief and a few other things
in it Mercy on us You didnt suppose Id go off to get married without
even a decent handkerchief did you I feel enough like a sneakin
ragamuffin and housebreaker as tis Why I ever was crazy enough
towhere have you put the horse

Mr Hammond led her to where George Washington was tethered The father
of his country was tired of standing alone in the damp and he trotted
off briskly The first mile of their journey was accomplished safely
although the night was pitchdark and when they turned into the Bayport
Road which for twothirds of its length leads through thick soft pine
and scruboak woods it was hard to distinguish even the horses ears
Miss Parker insisted that every curtain of the carryallat the back and
both sidesshould be closely buttoned down as she was fearful of the
effects of the night air

Fresh air never hurts nobody said Caleb There aint nothin so good
for a body as fresh air I sleep with my window open wide winter and
summer

You DO Well I tell you right now I dont I should say not I shut
every winder tight and I make Kenelm do the same thing I dont run any
risks from drafts

Mr Hammond grunted and was silent for some little time only
brightening up when the lady now in a measure recovered from her fright
and the anxiety of waiting began to talk of the blessings that were to
come from their independent wedded life in a home of their own

Well keep chickens she said because I do like fresh eggs for
breakfast Lets see this is the way twill be youll get up about
five oclock and kindle the fire and

Hey

I say youll get up at five oclock and kindle the fire

ME get up and kindle it

Sartin you dont expect Im goin to do you

Noo I suppose not It come kind of sudden thats all You see Ive
been used to turnin out about seven Seldom get up afore that

Seven My soul I always have my breakfast et by seven Well as I say
you get up at five and kindle the fire and then youll go out to the
henyard and get what eggs there is Then

Then Ill come in and call you and youll come down and get breakfast
What breakfasts we will have Eggs for you if you want em and ham and
fried potatoes for me and pie

Pie For breakfast

Sartin Laviny Marthy my first wife always had a piece of pie warmed
for me and Ive missed it since I dont really care two cents for
breakfast without pie

Well now Caleb if you think Im goin to get up and warm up pie every
mornin let alone fryin potatoes and

See here Hannah Seems to me if Im willin to turn out at that
ungodly hour and then go scratchin around the henhouse to please you
you might be willin to have a piece of pie het up for me

Well maybe youre right But I must saywell Ill try and do it
Itll seem kind of hard though after the simple breakfasts Kenelm and
I have when were alone Butwhat are you stoppin for

There seems to be a kind of crossroads here said Caleb bending
forward and peering out of the carryall Its so everlastin dark a
feller cant see nothin Yes there is crossroads three of em Now
which one do we take I aint drove to Bayport direct for years When we
went to the Cattle Show we went up through the Centre Do you know which
is the right road Hannah

Hannah peered forth from the blackness of the back seat Now let me
think she said Last time I went to Bayport by this road was four
year ago come next February Sarah Snows daughter Becky was married to
a feller named HigginsSolon Higgins son twas No twant his son
because

Aw crimus Who cares if twas his aunts granmother What I want to
know is which road to take

Well seems to me nigh as I can recollect that we took the lefthand
road No I aint sure but twas the righthand Theres a bare chance
that it might have been the middle one cause there was trees along
both sides I know we was goin to Becky Snows weddin

Trees long it There aint nothin BUT trees for two square miles
around these diggins Git dap you Ill take the righthand road I
think thats the way

Well so do I but as I say I aint sure You neednt be so cross and
unlikely whether tis or taint

If the main road had been dark the branch road was darker and the
branches of the trees slapped and scratched the sides of the carryall
Calebs whole attention was given to his driving and he said nothing
Miss Parker at length broke the dismal silence

Caleb she said what time had we ought to get to Bayport

About four oclock I should think Well drive round till about seven
oclock and then well go and get married I used to know the Methodist
minister there and

METHODIST minister You aint goin to a Methodist minister to be
married

I sartin shouldnt go to no one else Ive been goin to the Methodist
church for over thirty year You know that wells I do

I snum I never thought of it or you wouldnt have got me this far
without settlin that question I was confirmed into the Baptist faith
when I was twelve year old And you must have known that just as well as
I knew you was a Methodist

Well if you knew I was one you ought to know Id want a Methodist to
marry me Twas a Methodist married me afore

Humph What do you suppose I care who married you before Im the one
thats goin with you to be married now and if I was married by anybody
but a Baptist minister I wouldnt feel as if I was married at all

Well I shant be married by no Baptist

No Methodist shall marry ME

Now look here Hannah

I dont care Caleb You aint done nothin but contradict me since we
started Ive been settin up all night and Im tired out and theres
a draft comin in round these plaguy curtains right on the back of
my neck Ill get cold and die and youll have a funeral on your hands
instead of a weddin And I dont knows Id care much desperately

Caleb choked down his own irritation

There there Hannah he said dont talk about dyin when youre
just gettin ready to live We wont fret about the minister business
If worst comes to worst Ill give in to a Baptist I suppose One reason
I did figger on goin to a Methodist was that I bein of that faith I
thought maybe hed do the job a little cheaper for us

Cheaper What do you mean Was you callatin to make a BARGAIN with
him

No no course not But there aint any sense in heavin money away on
a parson moren on anybody else

Caleb Hammond how much do you intend givin that minister

Mr Hammond stirred uneasily on the seat of the carryall

Oh I dont know he answered evasively

Yes you do know too How much

I dont know Two or three dollars maybe

TWO or three dollars My soul and body Is two dollars all youre
willin to give up to get MARRIED Is THAT all the ceremonys worth to
you Two dollars My soul

Oh let up I dont care IllIll after a desperate wrestle with
his sense of economy Ill give him whatever you sayin reason Eh
   Whats that foolhead horse stoppin for now What in the tunkets
the matter with him

The matter was simply that in his hasty harnessing Mr Hammond had but
partially buckled one of the girths and the horse was now halfway out
of the shafts with the larger part of the harness well up towards his
ears Caleb groaningly climbed down from the seat rummaged out and lit
the lantern which he had been thoughtful enough to put under the seat
before starting and proceeded to repair damages This took a long time
and in getting back to the carryall he tore a triangular rent in the
back of his Sunday coat He had donned his best clothes to be married
in and to add to his troubles had left his watch in the fobpocket of
his everyday trousers so they had no means of knowing the time

Thats a nice mess he grumbled taking off his coat to examine the
tear by the light of the lantern Nicelookin ragbag Ill be to get
married

Maybe I can mend it when we get to Bayport said Miss Parker

Whatll you mend it withpins

No theres a needle and thread in my reticule Wait till we get to
Bayport and then

Cant mend it in broad daylight ridin up and down the main street can
you And Id look pretty shuckin my coat in the ministers parlor for
you to patch up the holes in it Couldnt you mend it now

Hannah announced her willingness to try and the reticule being
produced the needle was threaded after numerous trials and the mending
began Caleb holding the lantern watched the operation anxiously his
face falling at every stitch

Im afraid I havent made a good job of it sighed Hannah gazing
sorrowfully at the puckered and wrinkled star in the back of the
garment If youd only held that lantern steady instead of jigglin it
round and round so I might have done better

Mr Hammond said nothing but struggled into his coat and picked up the
reins He sighed heavily and his sigh was echoed from the back seat of
the carryall

The road was now very rough and the ruts were deep and full of holes
George Washington seemed to be stumbling through tall grass and bushes
and the carryall jolted and rocked from side to side Miss Parker grew
more and more nervous After a particularly severe jolt she could not
hold in any longer

Land of love Caleb she gasped Where ARE you goin It doesnt seem
as if this could be the right road

I dont know whether tis or not but its too narrow and too dark to
turn round so weve got to go ahead thats all

Oh heavens What a jounce that was Seems to me youre awful reckless
I wish Kenelm was drivin hes always so careful

This was too much Mr Hammond suppressed his feelings no longer

I wish to thunder he was he roared I wish Kenelm or some other dam
fool was here instead of me

Caleb HAMMOND

I dont care Hannah Youre enough to drive a deacon to swearin
Its been nothin but nag nag nag fight fight fight ever since this
cruise started Ifif we row like this afore were married whatll
it be afterwards Talk about bein independent Git dap there this a
savage roar at George Washington who had stopped again I do believe
the idiots struck with a palsy

Hannah leaned forward and touched her fellowsufferer on the arm Sshh
shh Caleb she said Dont holler so I dont blame you for hollerin
andand I declare I dont know as I much blame you for swearin though
I never thought ID live to say a thing like that But it aint the
horse deserves to be sworn at He aint the idiot the idiots are you
and me We was both of us out of sorts this mornin I guessI know I
wasand then you come along and we talked andand well we both went
into this foolish ridiculous awful piece of silliness without stoppin
to figger out whether we really wanted to or whether we was liable to
get along together or anything else Caleb Ive been wantin to say
this for the last hour or morenow Im goin to say it You turn that
horses head around and start right home again

Mr Hammond shook his head

No he said

I say yes I dont want to marry you and I dont believe you want to
marry me Now do youhonest

Caleb was silent for a full minute Then he drew a deep breath

It dont make no difference whether I do or not furs I can see he
said gloomily Its too late to start home now I dont know what time
tis but we must have been ridin three or four hoursseems eight or
ten year to meand we ought to be pretty near to Bayport If we
should turn back now we wouldnt get home till long after daylight and
everybody would be up and wantin to know the whys and wherefores If we
told em wed been ridin around together all night and didnt give any
reasons for it thered be talk enough to last till Judgment No weve
just got to get married now Thats all there is to it

Hannah groaned as the truth of this statement dawned upon her Caleb
gathered the reins in his hands preparatory to driving on when a new
thought came to him

Say Hannah he observed I suppose you left that note for Kenelm
didnt you

Miss Parker uttered a faint shriek

Oh my soul she cried I didnt I didnt I wrote it but I was so
upset when I found I couldnt get the doorkey and get out that way that
I left the note in my bureau drawer

Tut tut Huh Well he may find it there lets hope he does

But he wont He WONT He never finds anything even if its in plain
sight He wont know whats become of me

And hell most likely have the whole town out lookin for you I guess
now you see theres nothin to do but for us to get marrieddont you

Oh Oh Oh wailed Miss Parker and burst into tears

Caleb groaned Git dap he shouted to the horse No use cryin
Hannah Mights well grin and bear it The joyful bridal partyll now
proceed

But the horse refused to proceed and his driver peering forward dimly
saw a black barrier in front of him He lit the lantern once more and
getting out of the carryall discovered that the road apparently ended
at a rail fence that barred further progress

Queer he said We must be pretty nigh civilization Got to Bayport
most likely Hannah there seems to be a buildin ahead of us there Im
goin to take the lantern and explore You set still till I come back

But this Miss Parker refused to do She declared that she would not wait
alone in those woods for anybody or anything If her companion was going
to explore so was she So Mr Hammond assisted her to alight and after
he had taken down the bars the pair went on through a grove to where a
large building loomed against the sky

A church said Caleb One of the Bayport churches I callate Wonder
which tis

Theres always a sign on the front of a church said Hannah Lets go
around front and see

There were no trees in front of the church and when they came out by
the front platform Miss Parker exclaimed Well I never I wouldnt
believe Id remember so clear This church seems just as familiar as if
I was here yesterday Why whats the matter

Mr Hammond was standing on the platform holding his lantern up before
a giltlettered placard by the church door

Hannah he gurgled this nights been too much for me My foolishness
has struck out of my brains into my eyes I cant read straight Look
here

Hannah clambered up beside her agitated companion and read from the
placard these words

 FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH

 REV JONATHAN LANGWORTHY PASTOR

Good land she exclaimed Mr Langworthy Why Mr Langworthy is the
minister at Wellmouth Centre aint he I thought he was

He is but perhaps theres another one

No there aintnot another Baptist Andand this church what little
I can see of it LOOKS like the Wellmouth Centre Baptist Church too I
declare it does    Where are you goin

Caleb did not reply neither did he turn back Hannah who did not
propose to be left alone there in the dark was hurrying after him
but he stopped and when she reached his side she found him holding the
lantern and peering at an iron gate in a white fence His face seen by
the lantern light was a picture of bewildered amazement

What is it she demanded What IS it

He did not answer but merely pointed to the gate

Eh Whatwhywhy Caleb thatsaint that the Nickerson memorial
gate    It cant be Butbut it IS Why

Mr Hammond was muttering to himself

We took the wrong road at the crossin he said Then we must have
switched again probably when we was arguin about kindlin the fire
then we must have turned again when the harness broke and that must
have fetched us into Lemuel Ellis woodlot road that comes out

Eh Lemuel Ellis woodlot Why Lemuels woodlot is at

Its at Wellmouth Centre thats where tis No wonder that church
looked familiar Hannah we aint been nigh Bayport Weve been ridin
round and round in circles through them woods all night

Caleb HAMMOND

Before Caleb could add anything to his astonishing statement the silence
of the night was broken by the clang of the bell in the tower of the
church It clanged four times

WHAT exclaimed Caleb Only four oclock It cant be

My soul cried Miss Parker only four Whywhy I thought wed been
ridin ten hours at least    Caleb Hammond you and me dont want to
find a minister what we need to look up is a pair of guardians to take
care of us

But Mr Hammond seized her arm

Hannah he cried excitedly do you understand what that meansthat
clock strikin It means that bein as were only five miles from home
we can GET home if we want to afore anybodys out of bed You can
sneak up that ladder again I can get that horse and team back in
Thankfuls stable we can both be in our own beds by gettinup time and
not one soul need ever know a word about this foolishness If we

But Miss Parker had not waited for him to finish she was already on her
way to the carryall


At a quarter after seven that morning Thankful knocked at the door of
her boarders room

Mr Hammond she called Mr Hammond

Caleb awoke with a start

Eh he said

Are you up Its most breakfast time

Caleb now more thoroughly awake looked about his room It was real he
was actually in itand safeand still single

Yesyes all right he said Ill get right up Must have overslept
myself I guess Whatwhat made you call me Nothinernothins
happened has it

No nothins happened But youre usually up by seven and as I hadnt
heard a sound from you I was afraid you might be sick

No no I aint sick Im feelin fine Hashas Kenelm Parker got here
yet

Yes hes here

Aintaint said nothin has he

Said anything No What do you mean What did you expect him to say

Nothin nothin II wondered what sort of a drive he and Imogene had
yesterday thats all I thought it would be fine to hear him tell about
it You run along Mrs Barnes Ill hurry and get dressed

He jumped out of bed He was tired and lame and his head achedbut
Oh he was happy He had stabled George Washington and reached his room
without disturbing anyone And as Kenelm had according to Mrs Barnes
spoken and appeared as usual it was evident that Hannah Parker too
had gotten safely and undetected to her own apartment

Thankful knocked at his door again

Im sorry she said but Melindy Pease hasnt sent home your mendin
yet Im afraid youll have to do without youreryour winter things
for one more day

Hey My winterOh yes yes Well I dont care Its warmer today
than twas yesterday

Oh no it isnt its a good deal colder I hope you wont catch cold

No no I shant Im feelin fine

Well thank goodness for that

Thank goodness for a good many things said Mr Hammond devoutly




CHAPTER XIII


If Kenelm noticed that George Washington seemed unusually tired that
morning or that the old carryall behind the barn had some new scratches
on its sides and wheels and leaves and pine needles on its cushions and
floor he did not mention what he saw For a day or two both Mr Hammond
and Miss Parker were anxious and fearful but as nothing was said and
no questions were asked they began to feel certain that no one save
themselves knew of the elopement which had turned out to be no elopement
at all For a week Hannahs manner toward her brother was sweetness
itself She cooked the dishes he liked and permitted him to do as he
pleased without once protesting or nagging She had done comparatively
little of the latter since the announcement of the engagement but now
she was more considerate and selfsacrificing than ever If Kenelm was
aware of the change he made no comment upon it perhaps thinking it good
policy to let well enough alone Gradually the eloping couple began to
feel that their secret was secure and to cease worrying about it But
Caleb called no more at the Parker cottage and when he and Hannah met
they bowed but did not stop to converse

Miss Timpsons sudden departure from the High Cliff House caused less
talk than Thankful had feared It happened that the cousin Sarah to
whose home Miss Abigail had fled was seized with an attack of grippe
and this illness was accepted as the cause of the schoolmistresss move
And Miss Timpson herself kept her word she told no one of the warning
she had received So Thankful was spared the gossip and questioning
concerning the snoring ghost in the back bedroom For so much she was
grateful but she missed the weekly room rent and the weekly board
money The financial situation was becoming more and more serious for
her and as yet Solomon Cobb had not made known his decision in the
matter of the mortgage

During the week following Miss Timpsons departure Thankful spent
several nights in the rooms the former had vacated lying awake and
listening for sounds from the back bedroom She heard none No ghost
snored for her benefit Then other happenings happenings of this world
claimed her attention and she dropped psychical research for the time

The first of these happenings was the most surprising One forenoon
Kenelm returned from an errand to the village bringing the mornings
mail with him There were two letters for Mrs Barnes One was from
Emily and as this happened to be on top Thankful opened it first

There was good news in the letter good news for Georgie and also for
Mrs Barnes herself Georgie had been enjoying himself hugely during his
stay in East Wellmouth He spent every moment of pleasant weather out
of doors and his energetic exuberance kept the livestock as well as the
humans on the Capn Abner place awake and lively He fed the hens he
collected the eggs he pumped and carried water for George Washington
and the feeding of Patrick Henry was his especial care That pig now a
plump and somnolent porker was Georgies especial favorite It was past
hogkilling time in East Wellmouth but Thankful had given up the idea
of turning Patrick Henry into spare ribs and lard at least until her
lively young relatives visit was at an end That end was what Georgie
feared He did not want to go home Certainly Thankful did not want him
to go and she and Captain Obedthe latters fondness for his second
mate stronger than everwrote to Miss Howes begging her to use her
influence with the family to the end that Georgies visit might be
prolonged until after Christmas at any rate

And in Emilys reply the letter which Kenelm brought from the
postoffice that morning the permission was granted Georgie might stay
until New Years Day


Then wrote Emily he must come back with me Yes with me for you
see I am going to keep my word I am coming to spend my Christmas
vacation with you just as I said I should if it were possible There
arent you glad I know you are for you must be so lonely although one
not knowing you as well as I do would never guess it from your letters
You always write that all is well but I know By the way are there any
developments in the matter of the loan from Mr Cobb I am very glad
the renewal of the mortgage is to be all right but I think he should do
more than that And have you been troubled in the other affair that of
your neighbor You have not mentioned itbut have you


Thankful had not been troubled in the other affair That is to say
she had not been troubled by E Holliday Kendrick or his attorney
No move had been made at least so far as anyone could learn in the
project of forcing her to sell out and Heman Daniels declared that
none would be made It is one thing to boast said Mr Daniels and
another to make good Myahemerprofessional rival is beginning
to realize I think that he has in this case bitten off more than he
canerso to speak chew That young man has succeeded in ruining
himself in this community and that is all he has succeeded in

John said nothing At his new boardingplace Darius Holts he answered
no questions concerning his plans and was silent and noncommunicative
He kept to himself and made no effort to regain his lost popularity or
to excuse his action Thankful saw him but seldom and even Captain Obed
no longer mentioned Johns name unless it was mentioned to him Then he
discussed the subject with a scornful sniff and the stubborn declaration
that there was a mistake somewhere which would some day be explained
But his confidence was shaken that was plain and his optimism assumed
He and Mrs Barnes avoided discussion of John Kendrick and his affairs

Thankful read and reread the letter from Emily Howes The news it
contained was so good that she forgot entirely the fact that there was
another envelope in the mail Only when as she sprang to her feet to
rush out into the yard and tell Georgie that his plea for an extension
of his visit was granted was her attention called to this second
letter It fell from her lap to the floor and she stooped and picked it
up

The first thing she noticed was that the envelope was in a remarkably
crumpled and dirty condition It looked as if it had been carried in a
pocketand a not too clean pocketfor many days Then she noticed the
postmarkOmaha The address was the last item to claim her attention
and as she stared at the crumpled and crooked handwriting she gasped
and turned pale

Slowly she sank back into her chair and tore open the envelope The
inclosure was a dingy sheet of cheap notepaper covered with a penciled
scrawl With trembling fingers she unfolded the paper and read what was
written there Then she leaned back in the chair and put her hand to her
forehead

She was sitting thus when the door of the diningroom opened and a voice
hailed Ahoy there Anybody on deck

She turned to see Captain Obed Bangs cheery face peering in at her

Hello cried the captain entering the room and tossing his cap on the
table Youre here are you I was lookin for you and Imogene said she
callated you was aboard ship somewheres but she want sartin where
Ive come to get that second mate of mine Im goin off with a gang
to take up the last of my fish weirs and I thought maybe the little
shaverd like to go along I need help in bossin the fomast hands you
see and hes some considerble of a driver that second mate is
Yes siree You ought to hear him order em to get up anchor Ho ho
IHey Whywhy whats the matter

Thankfuls face was still pale and she was trembling

Nothin nothin Capn Bangs she said Ive had aa surprise
thats all

A surprise Yes you look as if you had Then noticing the letter in
her lap he added You aint had bad news have you

No No not exactly Its good news Yes in a way its good news
butbut I didnt expect it andand it has shook me up a good deal
   Andand I dont know what to do Oh I dont know WHAT Id ought
to do

The distress in her tone was so real that the captain was greatly
disturbed He made a move as if to come to her side and then
hesitating remained where he was

IId like to help you ThankerMrs Barnes he faltered
earnestly I like to fustrate ifif I could Aint thereis there
anything I could do to help Course you understand I aint nosin in
on your affairs but if you feel like tellin me maybe ILook
here taint nothin to do with that cussed Holliday Kendrick or his
meanness is it

Thankful shook her head No she said it isnt that Ive been
expectin that and Id have been ready for anything he might door
try to do But I wasnt expectin THIS How COULD anybody expect it I
thought he was dead I thought sure he must be dead Why its six year
since heand now hes alive and he wantsWhat SHALL I do

Captain Obed took a step forward

Now Mrs Barnes he begged I wish you wouldthat is you know if
you feel like it Iwell here I am Cant I do SOMETHIN

Thankful turned and looked at him She was torn between an intense
desire to make a confidant of someone and her habitual tendency to keep
her personal affairs to herself The desire overcame the habit

Capn Bangs she said suddenly I will tell you Ive just got to
tell somebody If he was just writin to say he was all right and alive
I shouldnt Id just be grateful and glad and say nothin But the poor
thing is povertystruck and friendless or he says he is and he wants
money Andand I havent got any money just now

I have promptly Or if I aint got enough with me I can get more
How much Just you say how much you think hell need and Ill have
it for you inside of a couple of hours If moneys all you wantwhy
thats nothin

Thankful heard little apparently of this prodigal offer She took up
the letter

Capn Bangs said she you remember I told you one time when we were
talkin together that I had a brotherJedediah his name waswho used
to live with me after my husband was drowned

Yes I remember You said hed run off to go golddiggin in the
Klondike or somewheres You said he was dead

I thought he must be I gave him up long ago because I was sartin sure
if he wasnt dead hed have written me askin me to let him come back
I knew hed never be able to get along all by himself But he isnt
dead Hes alive and hes written me now Heres his letter Read it
please

The captain took the letter and slowly read it through It was a
rambling incoherent epistle full of smudges where words had been
scratched out and rewritten but a pitiful appeal nevertheless Jedediah
Cahoon had evidently had a hard time since the day when after declaring
his intention never to return until loaded down with money he had
closed the door of his sisters house at South Middleboro and gone out
into the snowstorm and the world His letter contained few particulars
He had wandered far even as far as his professed destination the
Klondike but wherever he had been ill luck was there to meet him
He had earned a little money and lost it earned a little more and
lost that had been in Nome and Vancouver and Portland and Seattle had
driven a street car in Tacoma


I wrote you from Tacoma Thankful the letter said after I lost that
job but you never answered Now I am in Frisco and I am down and out
I aint got any good job and I dont know where I will get one I want
to come home Cant I come I am sorry I cleared out and left you the
way I done and if you will let me come back home again I will try to
be a good brother to you I will honest I wont complain no more and
I will split the kindling and everything Please say I can come Do
PLEASE


Then came the appeal for money money for the fare east It was to be
sent to an address in San Francisco in care of a person named Michael
Kelly


I am staying with this Kelly man concluded Jedediah He keeps a kind
of hotel like and I am doing chores for him If you send the money right
off I will get it I guess before he fires me Send it QUICK for the Lord
sakes


Captain Obed finished the letter

Whew he whistled Hes in hard luck aint he

Thankful wrung her hands Yes she answered and I must help him
somehow But how Im goin to do it just now I dont see But I must of
course Hes my brother and I MUST

Sartin you must Weerthat is that can be fixed all right Humph
He sent this to you at South Middleboro didnt he and twas forwarded
Lets see when he wrote it    Eh Why twas written two months ago
Where in the world has it been all this time

I dont know I cant think And he says he is in San Francisco and
the postmark on that envelope is Omaha Nebraska

Land of love so tis And the postmark date is only four days back
Why did he hang on to the thing for two months afore he mailed it And
how did it get to Omaha

I dont know All I can think of is that he gave the letter to somebody
else to mail and that somebody forgot it Thats all I can think of I
cant really think of anything after a shock like this Oh dear Oh
dear The poor helpless incompetent thing Hes probably starved to
death by this time and its all my fault I NEVER should have let him
go What SHALL I do Wasnt there enough without this

For the first time Thankfuls troubles overcame her courage and
selfrestraint She put her handkerchief to her eyes

The captain was greatly upset He jammed his hands into his pockets
took them out again reached for his own handkerchief blew his nose
violently and began pacing up and down the room Suddenly he seemed to
have made up his mind

Mrs Barnes he said II

Thankfuls face was still buried in her handkerchief

II continued Captain Obed Now now dont do that Dont DO it

Mrs Barnes wiped her eyes

I wont she said stoutly I wont I know Im silly and childish

You aint neither Youre the pluckiest and best woman ever was Youre
the finestererOh consarn it Thankful dont cry any more Cant
you desperately cant you see I cant stand it to have you

All right Capn Bangs I wont Dont you bother about me or my
worries I guess likely youve got enough of your own most people
have

I aint I aint got enough Do me good if I had more Thankful see
here whats the use of your fightin all these things alone Ive
watched you ever since you made port here in South Wellmouth and its
been nothin but fight and worry all the time Whats the use of it
Youre too good a woman to waste your life this way Give it up

Give it up

Yes give it up Give up this wearin yourself out keepin boarders and
runnin this big house Why dont you stop takin care of other folks
and take care of yourself for a spell

But I cant I cant take care of myself All I have is invested in
this place and if I give it up I lose everything

Yes yes I know what you mean But what I mean isis

What do you mean

I meanI mean why dont you let somebody take care of you Thats what
I mean

Thankful turned to stare at him

Somebodyelsetake care of me she repeated

Yesyes Dont look at me like that If you do I cant say it
ImIm havin aa hard enough time sayin it as tis Thankful
Barnes whydont LOOK at me I tell you

But she still looked at him and if a look ever conveyed a meaning
hers did just then

I aint crazy declared Captain Obed I can see you think I am but
I aint Thankful IOh thunderation What is the matter with me
Thankful let ME take care of you will you

Thankful rose to her feet Obed Bangs she exclaimed

I mean it Ive been meanin it more and more ever since I first met
you but I aint had the spunk to say it Now Im goin to say it if I
keel over on the last word Thankful why dont you marry me

Thankful was speechless The captain plunged desperately on

Will you Thankful he begged I know Im an old codger but I aint
in my second childhood not yet IId try mighty hard to make you
happy I havent got anybody of my own in the world Neither have
youexcept this brother of yours and judgin from his letter and what
you say HE wont take any care hell BE a care thats all I aint
rich but Ive got money enough to help youand himand me afloat and
comftable Thankful will you

Thankful was still looking at him He would have spoken again but she
raised her hand and motioned him to silence

Obed she asked after a moment what made you say this to me

What made me say it What kept me still so long you ought to ask
Havent I come to think more and more of you ever since I knew you
Havent I been more and more sorry for you And pitied you I

She raised her hand again I see she said slowly I see Thank
you Obed Youre so kind and selfsacrificin youd do anything or say
anything to help afriend wouldnt you But of course you cant do
this

Cant Why cant I Selfsacrifice be hanged Thankful cant you

Yes Oh yes I can see    Now lets talk about Jedediah Do you
think

Jedediah be keelhauled Will you marry me Thankful Barnes

Why no Obed of course I wont

You wont Why not

Becausewell because II cant There there Obed Please dont ask
me again Please dont

Captain Obed did not ask He did not speak again for what to Mrs
Barnes seemed a long long time At length she could bear it no longer

PLEASE Obed she begged

The captain slowly shook his head Then he laughed a short mirthless
laugh

What an old fool I am he muttered What an old fool

Obed dont talk so Dont Do you want to make
thiseverythingharder for me

He straightened and squared his shoulders

Thank you Thankful he said earnestly Thank you for sayin that
Thats the way to talk to me I know Im an old fool but I wont be any
more if I can help it Make it harder for you I guess not

Obed Im so sorry

Sho sho You neednt be    Im all right Ive been dreamin
foolish dreams like a young feller after a church picnic dinner but
Im awake now Yesm Im awake Now just you forget that I talked in my
sleep Forget the whole of it and lets get back toto that brother of
yours Weve got to locate him thats the first thing to be done Ill
send a telegram right off to that Kelly man out in Frisco askin if
whatshisnameJedediahis there yet

Obed you wontyou wont feel hard towards me You wont
letthisinterfere with our friendship

Sho Hush hush Thankful You make me more ashamed of myself than
ever and that aint necessary Now the first thing is to send that
telegram If we locate your brother then well send him a ticket to
Boston and some money Dont you worry Thankful well get him here
And dont you fret about the money neither Ill tend to that and you
can pay me afterwards

No no of course I shant let

Yes you will Theres some things you cant stop and thats one of
em You talked about our friendship didnt you Well unless you want
me to believe I aint your friend youll let me run my own course
this time So long Thankful Im off to Chris Badgers to send that
telegram

He snatched up his cap and was on his way to the door She followed him

Obed she faltered IIWhat CAN I say to you You are SO good

Tut tut Me good Dont let Heman Daniels hear you say that Hes a
church deacon and knows what goodness is So long Thankful Soons I
hear from Kelly Ill report

He hurried from the house Thankful watched him striding down the path
Not once did he hesitate or look back She turned from the door and
returning to her chair by the center table sat down For a moment she
sat there and then leaning her head upon her arms on the table wept
tears of absolute loneliness and despair

The telegram to Michael Kelly of San Francisco brought an answer but
a most unsatisfactory one Jedediah Cahoon had not been in the Kelly
employ for more than six weeks Kelly did not know where he had gone
and apparently did not care Captain Obed then wired and wrote the San
Francisco police officials urging them to trace the lost one This they
promised to do but nothing came of it The weeks passed and no word
from them or from Jedediah himself was received His letter had come to
prove that at the time it was written he was alive whether or not he
was still alive or where he might be if living was as great a mystery
as ever Day after day Thankful watched and waited and hoped but her
waiting was unrewarded and though she still hoped her hope grew
steadily fainter and the selfreproach and the worry greater in
proportion

She and Georgie and Imogene spent Thanksgiving Day alone Heman Daniels
and Mr Hammond were invited out and Captain Obed who had meant to eat
his Thanksgiving dinner at the High Cliff House was called to Boston on
business connected with his fish selling and could not return in time

Early in December Thankful once more drove to Trumet to call upon
Solomon Cobb The question of the renewal of the mortgage she felt must
remain a question no longer But she obtained little satisfaction from
her talk with the moneylender Mr Cobbs first remark concerned the
Holliday Kendrick offer to buy the Capn Abner place

Did he mean it do you think he demanded Is he really so sot on
buyin as folks say he is

Im afraid so

Huh And hes hired his lawyerthat young cousin of hisBailey
Kendricks sonto make you sell out to him

Yes

Whats the young feller done about it anything

No nothin that I know of

Humph Sure of that be ye I hear hes been spendin considerble time
over to Ostable lately hangin round the courthouse and the probate
clerks office Know what hes doin that for

No I didnt know he had How did you know it

I knew Aint much goin on that I dont know I make it my business to
know Why dont you sell out to old Holliday

I dont want to sell My boardinhouse has just got a good start and
why should I give it up I wont sell

Oh you wont Pretty independent for anybody with a mortgage hangin
over em aint ye

Solomon are you goin to renew that mortgage when it comes due

Mr Cobb pulled his whiskers I dont knows I am and I dont knows I
aint he said This Kendrick business kind of mixes things up Might
be a good idea for me to foreclose that mortgage and sell the place to
him at my own price Eh What do you think of that

You wouldnt do it You couldnt be so

So what Business is business and if hes goin to put you out anyhow
I dont see why I shouldnt get my share of the pickins

But he aint goin to put me out

He says he is Nownowclear out and dont bother me When that
mortgage falls due Ill let you know what I intend doin with it If
you pester me now I wont renew anyhow Go along home and quit your
frettin Longs youre there you BE there What more do you want

There was a good deal more of this sort of thing but it was all quite
as unsatisfactory Thankful gave it up at last

I shant come here again she declared desperately If you want to
see me you can come to my place

Humph

Well you will or not see me Why havent you been there Time and
time again you have promised to come but you never have I shall begin
to believe there is some reason why you dont want to go into that
house

She was on her way to the door but Solomon called after her

Here he shouted Hold on What do you mean by that Why shouldnt I
go into that house if I want to Why shouldnt I

I dont know all I know is that you dont seem to want to I cant say
why you dont want to but

But what

But maybe if someone thats dead and gone was herehe could

Hehewho What Hi Where you goin

Im goin home

No you aintnot until you tell me what you mean byby somebody
thats dead and gone What kind of talk is that What do you mean

Maybe I dont know what I mean Solomon but I think you do If you
dont then your looks belie you thats all

She went out of the henhouse As she drove away she saw Mr Cobb
peering at her through the window He was weeding with both hands and
he looked agitated andyes frightened Thankful was more than ever
certain that his mysterious behavior was in some way connected with his
past dealings with her Uncle Abner but not knowing what those dealings
might have been the certainty was not likely to help her And he had
not said that he would renew the mortgage

Georgie was the first to meet her when she drove into the yard He had
been spending the day with Captain Obed and had coaxed the latter into
telling him stories of Santa Claus Georgies mind was now filled with
anticipations of Christmas and Christmas presents and his faith in
Santa which had been somewhat shaken during his year at kindergarten in
South Middleboro was reviving again The captain and Imogene and Mrs
Barnes all helped in the revival Christmas loses threequarters of its
fun when old Santas took out of it declared Captain Obed I know
count of havin been a young one myself a thousand year ago or
such matter Thisll probably be the second mates last Santa Claus
Christmas so lets keep this one the real thing for the boy

So he and Imogene and Thankfulyes even Kenelmdiscussed Santa for
Georgies benefit and Georgie believed although his belief was not as
absolute and unquestioning as it had once been He asked a great many
questions some of which his elders found hard to answer His dearest
wish was for an airgun but somehow Mrs Barnes did not seem to think
the wish would be gratified She had a strong presentiment that the
combination of Georgie and an airgun and the chickens might not be a
desirable one especially for the chickens

But why wont he bring it Auntie demanded Georgie You say he
brings good boys what they want Ive been a good boy aint I

Deed you have I wouldnt ask for a better one

Then why wont Santa bring me the gun

Perhaps hell think a gun isnt nice for such a little boy to have

But it is nice Its nicern anything If Im good and I want it I
dont see why I cant have it I think Santas mean if he dont bring
it

Oh no he isnt mean Just think how good he is He comes to every boy
and girl

No he dont

Why yes he does To every good little boy and girl

He never came to Patsy Leary that lived up on the lots in Middleboro
Patsy said he didnt he said there wasnt any Santa Claus Patsy did

Hum Perhaps Patsy wasnt good

Gee Yes he was He can play baseball bettern any boy I know And he
can lick any kid his size he told me he could

This crushing proof of young Learys goodness was a staggerer for
Thankful Before she could think of a reply Georgie asked another
question

You say hell come down the chimney he queried

Yes

The livinroom chimney

Yes probably

No he wont

Georgie

How can he Hes so fat hes ever so fat in the pictures How can he
get through the stovepipe

Mrs Barnes answer was evasive and Georgie noticed the evasion
However his trust in his Aunt Thankful was absolute and if she said
a fat man could get through a stovepipe he probably could But the
performance promised to be an interesting one Georgie wished he might
see it He thought a great deal about it and little by little a plan
began forming in his mind

Three days before Christmas Emily Howes arrived at the High Cliff House
She was received with rejoicings The young lady looked thinner than
when she went away and seemed more grave and careworn But when Thankful
commented upon her appearance Emily only laughed and declared herself
quite well and perfectly happy She and her cousin discussed all topics
of common interest except one that one was John Kendrick Once or twice
Thankful mentioned the young mans name but invariably Emily changed
the subject It was evident that she did not wish to speak of John
also it was to Mrs Barnes just as evident that she thought of him
Thankful believed that those thoughts were responsible for the change in
her relatives look and manner

Christmas was to be as Thanksgiving had been a day free from boarders
at the High Cliff House Caleb was again asked out and Mr Daniels
so he said called away He had spent little time in East Wellmouth of
late though no one seemed to know exactly where he had been or why

The day before Christmas was cold and threatening Late in the afternoon
it began to rain and the wind to blow By supper time a fairly able
storm had developed and promised to develop still more Captain Obed
his arms filled with packages all carefully wrapped and all mysterious
and not to be opened till the next day came in just after supper

Wheres that second mate of mine whispered the captain anxiously
When told that Georgie was in the kitchen with Imogene he sighed in
relief

Good he said Hide those things as quick as ever you can afore he
lays eyes on em Hes sharpern a sail needle that young one is and
if he cant see through brown paper he can GUESS through it I bet you
Take em away and put em out of sightquick

Emily hurried upstairs with the packages Captain Obed turned to
Thankful

How is she these days he asked with a jerk of the head in the
direction taken by Miss Howes

Shes pretty well or she says she is I aint so sure myself Im
afraid she thinks aboutabout HIM more than she makes believe Im
afraid matters between them two had gone farthern we guessed

Captain Obed nodded Shouldnt wonder he said John looks pretty
peaked too I saw him just now

You did John Kendrick Hes been out of town for a week or two so I
heard Where did you see him

At the Centre depot I was up to the Centreerbuyin a few things
and he got off the noon train

Did you speak to him

Yes or he spoke to me He and I aint said much to each otherwhat
little weve seen of each other latelybut thats been his fault moren
twas mine He sung out to me this time though and I went over to the
platform Say after a moments hesitation theres another thing
I want to ask you Hows Heman Daniels actin since Emily come Seems
moren extry happy does he

Whywhy no Hes been away too a good deal on business he said

Humph He anderEmily havent been extra thick then

No Come to think of it theyve hardly seen each other Emily has acted
sort ofsort of queer about him too She didnt seem to want to talk
about him moren she has about John

Humph Thats funny I cant make it out You see Heman got on that
same train John got off He was comin along the depot platform just as
I got to it And the depotmaster sung out to him

The depotmaster Eben Foster you mean

Yup He sung out Congratulations Heman says he

What you congratulatin him for says I

Aint you heard says he Hes engaged to be married

Thankful uttered an exclamation

Engaged she repeated Mr Daniels engagedto be married

So Eben said I wanted to ask a million questions of course but John
Kendrick was right alongside me and I couldnt John must have heard it
too and it did seem to me that he looked pretty well shook up but he
want any more shook than I was I thoughtWell you see I thought

Thankful knew what he had thought She also was shaken up

I dont believe it she cried Ififit cant he HER Why she
would have told me Im sure Obed you dont think

I dont know what to think Hemans been writin her pretty reglar
I know that cause Chris Badger told me so a week after shed gone I
dont know Thankful one things sartin Hemans kept his engagement
mighty quiet How Eben learned of it I dont know but nobody in East
Wellmouth knows for Ive been soundin ever since I struck here

Thankful was greatly troubled I HOPE it aint true she cried I
suppose hes all right butbut I didnt want Emily to marry him

Neither did I Perhaps she aint goin to Perhaps its just a
roundthestove lie like a shipload of others thats set afloat every
day But from somethin John Kendrick said to me on that platform I
knew he heard what Eben said

How do you know

Cause he as much as told me so Is it true says he

I dont know says I First Id heard of it if tis

He just nodded his head and seemed to be thinkin When he did speak
twas more to himself than to me Well says he then that settles
it I can do it now with a clear conscience

Do what I asked him

Oh nothin he says Capn Obed are you goin to be busy all day
tomorrow I know its Christmas of course but are you

Not so busy itll wreck my nerves keepin up with my dates says I
Why

Can you spare a halfhour or so to come round to my office atwell
say two tomorrow afternoon Ive got a little business of my own and Id
like to have you there Will you come

Sartin I told him

Of course if youre afraid of the moral leprosy

I aint

Then Ill look for you says he and off he went I aint seen him
since He come down along of Winnie S and I had one of Chris Badgers
teams Now WHAT do you callate it all means

I dont know I dont know But I cant think EmilyHush shes
comin

Emily entered the room and Captain Obed began philosophically concerning
the storm which he declared was liable to be a hooter

He went away soon after At the door when he and Mrs Barnes were
alone he whispered Aint changed your mind have you Thankful
Aboutabout what I said to you that day

Obed please You said you wouldnt

All right all right Well good night Ill be around tomorrow to
wish you and Emily and the second mate a merry Christmas Good night
Thankful

After he had gone Thankful and Emily assisted Georgie in hanging up his
stocking and preparing for bed The boy seemed willing to retire a most
unusual willingness for him His only worry appeared to be concerning
Santa Claus whom he feared might be delayed in his rounds by the storm

Hell be soaked soppin wet wont he he asked anxiously

Oh he wont mind Santa Claus dont mind this kind of weather He
lives up at the North Pole so folks say

Yes Wont the chimney soot all stick to him when hes wet Hell be a
sight wont he

Perhaps so but he wont mind that either Now you go to bed
Georgie like a good boy

Im agoin Say Aunt Thankful will the soot come all off on my
presents

They got him into bed at last and descended to the livingroom The
storm was worse than ever The wind howled and the rain beat Emily
shivered

Mercy What a night she exclaimed It reminds me of our first night
in this house Auntie

Does thats a fact Well I hope theres nobody prowlin around
lookin for a place to put their head in the way we were then
Iwhats that

What What Auntie I didnt hear anything

I thought I did Sounded as if somebody wasand they are Listen

Emily listened From without above the noise of the wind and rain and
surf came a shout

Hi screamed a highpitched voice Hi Let me in IIm drownin

Thankful rushed to the door and exerting all her strength pushed it
open against the raging storm

Theres nobody here she faltered

Butbut there is Auntie I heard someone I

She stopped for out of the drenched darkness staggered a figure the
figure of a man He plunged across the threshold tripped over the mat
and fell in a heap upon the floor

Emily shrieked Mrs Barnes pulled the door shut and ran to the
prostrate figure

Who is it she asked Who IS it Are you hurt

The figure raised its head

Hurt it panted Its a wonder I aint dead Whats the matter with
ye Didnt you hear me yellin for you to open that door

Thankful drew a long breath

For mercy sakes she cried Solomon Cobb WHAT are you doin over
here a night like this




CHAPTER XIV


Mr Cobb slowly raised his head He looked about him in a bewildered
way and then his gaze fixed itself upon Mrs Barnes

WhatwhyYOU he gasped

Eh stammered Thankful whose surprise and bewilderment were almost as
great as his Eh What

You repeated Solomon Whatwhat are you doin here

What am I doin here What am I doin

Yes Then after another stare about the room he added This aint
Kenelm Parkers house Whose house is it

Its my house of course Emily go and fetch somesome water or
somethin Hes out of his head

Emily hurried to the kitchen Thankful hastened to help the unexpected
visitor to his feet But the visitor declined to be helped

Let me alone he roared Let me be II want to know whose house
this is

Its my house I tell you You ought to know whose house it is Land
sakes You and I have had talk enough about it lately Dont you know
where you are What are you sittin there on the floor for Are you
hurt

Slowly Mr Cobb rose to his feet

Do you mean to tell me he demanded that this isis Abners place
Howd I get here

I dont know I aint hardly had time to make sure you are here yet
And Im sartin YOU aint sure That was an awful tumble you got Seems
as if you must have hurt yourself And youre soppin wet through What
in the WORLD

She moved toward him again but he waved her away

Let me alone he ordered I was headin for Kenelm Parkers Howd I
get here

I tell you I dont know I suppose you lost your way No wonder such a
nights this Set down Let me get you somethin hot to drink Come out
in the kitchen by the cookstove Dont

Hush up Let me think I never see such a woman to talk II dont see
how I done it I left Chris Badgers and came across the fields and

And you took the wrong path I guess likely Did you WALK from Chris
Badgers Wheres your horse and team You didnt walk from the Centre
did you

Course I didnt Think Im a dum fool My horse fell down and hurt his
knee and I left him in Badgers barn I callated to go to Kenelms and
put up over night I

He was interrupted by Emily who entered with a glass in her hand

Heres the water Auntie she said Is he better now

Better snorted Solomon Whats the matter with you I aint sick
What you got in that tumbler Water What in time do I want of any more
water Dont I look as if Id had water enough to last me one spell
Imconsarn it all Im a reglar sponge How far off is Kenelms from
here How long will it take me to get there

Thankful answered and her answer was decisive

I dont know she said but I do know you aint goin to try to get
anywhere till mornin You and I aint been any too lovin Solomon
Cobb but I shant take the responsibility of your dyin of pneumonia
Youll stay right here and the first thing Ill do is head off that
chill youve got this very minute

There was no doubt about the chill Solomons face and hands were
blue and he was shaking from head to foot But his determination was
unshaken He strode to the door

How do I get to Parkers he demanded

I tell you you mustnt go to Parkers or anywhere else Youre riskin
your life

Mr Cobb did not answer He lifted the latch and pulled the door open A
howling gust of winddriven rain beat in upon him drenching the carpet
and causing the lamp to flicker and smoke For a moment Solomon gazed
out into the storm then he relinquished his hold and staggered back

II cant do it he groaned Ive GOT to stay here Ive GOT to

Thankful exerting all her strength closed the door and locked it
Indeed youve got to she declared Now go out into the kitchen and
set by the stove while I heat a kettle and make you some ginger tea or
somethin

Solomon hesitated

He must Aunt Thankful urged Emily he really must

The visitor turned to stare at her

Who are you he demanded ungraciously Then as another chill racked
him from head to foot he added I dont care Take me somewheres and
give me somethinginger tea oror kerosene or anything else so its
hot IImshoooook all topiicces

They led him to the kitchen where Thankful prepared the ginger tea
During its preparation she managed to inform Emily concerning the
identity of their unexpected lodger Solomon introduced to Miss Howes
merely grunted and admitted that he had heard tell of her His manner
might have led a disinterested person to infer that what he had heard
was not flattering He drank his tea and as he grew warmer inside and
out his behavior became more natural which does not mean that it was
either gracious or grateful

At length he asked what time it was Thankful told him

I think youd better be gettin to bed Solomon she suggested
Ill hunt up one of Mr Caleb Hammonds nightshirts and while youre
sleepin your wet clothes can be dryin here by the cookstove

Solomon grunted but he was apparently willing to retire Then came
the question as to where he should sleep Emily offered a suggestion

Why dont you put him in the back room Auntie she said The one
Miss Timpson used to have That isnt occupied now and the bed is
ready

Thankful hesitated I dont knows hed better have that room Emily
she said

Why not Im sure its a very nice room

Yes I know it is but

But what

Mr Cobb had a remark to make

Well come on come on he said testily Put me somewheres and do
it quick Longs Ive GOT to sleep in this house I mights well be doin
it Where is this room youre talkin about Lets see it

Emily took the lamp and led the way up the back stairs Solomon followed
her and Thankful brought up the rear She felt a curious hesitancy
in putting even her disagreeable relative in that room on this night
Around the gables and upon the roof the storm whined and roared as
it had the night when she first explored that upper floor And she
remembered now that it had stormed though not as hard the night
when Miss Timpson received her warning If there were such things as
ghosts and if the little back bedroom WAS haunted a night like this
was the time for spectral visitations She had half a mind to give Mr
Cobb another room

But before she could decide what to do before the struggle between her
commonsense and what she knew were silly forebodings was at an end
the question was decided for her Solomon had entered the large room and
expressed his approval of it

Thisll do first rate he said Why didnt you want to put me in
here Suppose you thought twas too good for me eh Well it might be
for some folks but not for me Whats that a closet

He was pointing to the closed door of the little room the one which
Miss Timpson had intended using as a study Thankful had after her last
night of fruitless spook hunting closed the door and locked it

Whats this door locked for asked Mr Cobb who had walked over and
was trying the knob

Oh nothing its just another empty room thats all Theres nothin
in it

Humph Is that so What do you lock up a room with nothin in it for
He turned the key and flung the door open Ugh he grunted in evident
disappointment Tis empty aint it Well good night

Emily whose face expressed a decided opinion concerning the visitor
walked out into the hall Thankful remained

Solomon she said in a whisper tell me Have you made up your mind
about that mortgage

Um No I aint Part of what I came over here today for was to find
out a little more about this property and about Holliday Kendricks
offer for it I may have a talk with him afore I decide about renewin
that mortgage It looks to me as if twould be pretty good business to
dicker with him Hes got money and if I can get some of it so much
the better for me

Solomon you dont mean

I dont know what I mean yet I tell ye But I do tell you this Im
a business man and I know the value of money I worked hard for what I
got twant left me by nobody like some folkss I hear of Dont
ask me no more questions Ill see old Kendrick tomorrow maybe hes
expected down

He is Mr Holliday Kendrick How do you know

I know cause I found out same as I usually find out things Chris
Badger got a telegram through his office from Holliday to John Kendrick
sayin hed come on the noon train

But why should he come And on Christmas day

I dont know Probably he aint so silly about Christmas as the average
run of idiots Hes a business man too There Good night good night
Leave me alone sos I can say my prayers and turn in Im pretty nigh
beat out

And you wont tell me about that mortgage

No Ill tell you when my minds made up that aint yet

Thankful turned to go At the threshold she spoke once more

I wonder what you say in those prayers of yours Solomon she
observed I should imagine the Lord might find em interestin

Im glad I said it Emily she told her cousin who was awaiting her
in her bedroom I presume likely itll do more harm than good but it
did ME good while I was sayin it The mean stingy old hypocrite Now
lets go downstairs and fill Georgies stockin

But that ceremony it appeared must be deferred Georgie was still
wideawake He called to Emily to ask if the man who had come was Santa
Claus

The little rascal chuckled Thankful Well with a sigh hell
never make a worse guess if he lives to be as old as Methuselahs
grandmarm Emily you sneak down and fetch the stockin and the presents
up here to my room Well do the fillin here and hang up the stockin
in the mornin afore he gets up

While they were filling the stocking and tying the packages containing
gifts too bulky to be put in it Miss Howes crossquestioned her cousin
Emily had been most unfavorably impressed with Mr Cobb during this
her first meeting with him and her suspicions concerning Thankfuls
financial affairs already aroused by the ladys reticence were now
active She questioned and after a time Thankful told her first a
little and then all the truth

I didnt mean to tell you Emily she said tearfully I didnt mean
to tell a soul but II just couldnt keep it to myself any longer If
he doesnt renew that mortgageand goodness knows what hell do after
he talks with Mr Holliday KendrickII dont see how I can help
losin everything Its either that or sell out and I dont want to
sellOh I dont I know I can make a go of this place of mine if I
have another year of it I KNOW I can

Emily was very much excited and fiercely indignant

The beast she cried referring to the pious occupant of the back
bedroom the mean wicked miserable old miser To think of his being
a relative of yours Aunt Thankful and treating you so And accepting
your hospitality at the very time when he is considering taking your
home away from you

Thankful smiled ruefully As to that Emily she said I aint
greatly surprised Judgin by what Ive seen of Sol Cobb I should say
twas a part of his gospel to accept anything he can get for nothin
But how he can have the face to pray while hes doin it I dont see
What kind of a God does he think hes prayin to I should think hed
be scared to get down on his knees for fear hed never be let up
again Well if there IS a ghost in that room I should say this was its
chance

A ghost What are you talking about Auntie

Eh Oh nothin nothin Did I say ghost I didnt realize what I
said I guess

Then why did you say it

Oh I dont know    There there dont lets get any more foolish
than we can help Lets go to bed Well have to turn out awful early
in the mornin to get Georgies stockin hung up and his presents ready
Now trot off to bed Emily

Aunt Thankful youre hiding something from me I know you are

Now Emily you know I wouldnt

Yes you would At least you have All this time you have been
deceiving me about that mortgage And now I think there is something
else What did you mean by a ghost in that room

I didnt mean anything There aint any ghost in that roomthe one
Solomons in

In THAT room Is there one in another room

Now Emily

Aunt Thankful there is something strange in some room dont deny it
You arent accustomed to deceiving people and you cant deceive me now
Tell me the truth

Well Emily its all such perfect foolishness You dont believe in
ghosts do you

Of course I dont

Neither do I Whatever it is that snores and groans in that little back
room aint

AUNTIE What DO you mean

Thankful was cornered Her attempts at evasion were useless and little
by little Emily drew from her the story of the little back bedroom of
her own experience there the night of their first visit of what Winnie
S had said concerning the haunting of the Capn Abner place and of
Miss Timpsons warning She told it in a low tone so as not to awaken
Georgie and as she spoke the wind shrieked and wailed and groaned
the blinds creaked the water dripped and gurgled in the gutters and
the shadows outside the circle of light from the little hand lamp were
black and threatening Emily as she listened felt the cold shivers
running up and down her spine It is one thing to scoff at superstition
in the bright sunlight it is quite another to listen to a tale like
this on a night like this in a house a hundred years old Miss Howes
scoffed it is true but the scoffing was not convincing

Nonsense she said stoutly A ghost that snores Who ever heard of
such a thing

Nobody ever did I guess Thankful admitted Its all too silly for
anything of course I KNOW its silly but Emily theres SOMETHIN
queer about that room I told you what I heard somethin or somebody
said Oh Lord as plain as ever I heard it said And somethin or
somebody snored when Miss Timpson was there And of course when they
tell me how old Mr Eldredge snored in that very room when he was dyin
and how Miss Timpsons sister snored when SHE was sick itit

Oh stop Auntie You will have ME believing inin things if you keep
on Its nonsense and you and I will prove it so before I go back to
Middleboro Now you must go to bed

Yes Im goin Well if there is a ghost in that room itll have its
hands full with Sol Cobb Hes a tough old critter if ever there was
one Good night Emily

Good night Aunt Thankful Dont worry about theha haghost will
you

No Ive got enough to worry about this side of the grave    Mercy
whats the matter

Nothing II thought I heard a noise inin the hall I didnt
though

No course you didnt Shall I go to your room with you

No indeed II should be ashamed to have you Where is Imogene

Shes up in her room She went to bed early Goodness Hear that wind
It cries likelike somethin human

Its dreadful It is enough to make anyone think    There If you
and I talk any longer we shall both be behaving like children Good
night

Good night Emily Is Georgie asleep at last

I think so I havent heard a sound from him Call me early Auntie

Thankful lit her own lamp Emily took the one already lighted and
hastened down the hall Thankful shut the door and prepared for bed
The din of the storm was terrific The old house shook as if it
were trembling with fright and screaming in the agony of approaching
dissolution It was a long time before Thankful fell asleep but at last
she did

She was awakened by a hand upon her arm and a voice whispering in her
ear

Auntie whispered Emily Auntie wake up Oh DO wake up

Thankful was broad awake in a moment She sat up in bed The room was in
black darkness and she felt rather than saw Miss Howes standing beside
her

What is it Emily she cried What is the matter

Hush hush Dont speak so loud Get up Get up and light the lamp

Thankful sprang out of bed and hunted for the matchbox She found it
after a time and the lamp was lighted Emily wearing a wrapper over her
night clothes was standing by the door apparently listening Her face
was white and she was trembling

What IS it whispered Thankful

Hush I dont know what it is Listen

Thankful listened All she heard were the noises of the storm

I dont hear anything she said

Nono you cant hear it from here Come out into the hall

Cautiously and on tiptoe she led the way to the hall and toward the head
of the front stairs There she seized her cousins arm and whispered in
her ear

Listen she breathed

Thankful listened

Whywhy she whispered theres somebody down in the livinroom
Who is it

I dont know There are more than one for I heard them talking Who
CAN it be

Thankful listened again

Wheres Georgie she whispered after a moment

In his room I suppose    What You dont think

Thankful had tiptoed back to her own room and was returning with the
lamp Together they entered Georgies bed chamber But bed and room were
empty Georgie was not there




CHAPTER XV


Georgie had gone to bed that Christmas Eve with a welldefined plan in
his small head He knew what he intended doing and how he meant to do
it The execution of this plan depended first of all upon his not
falling asleep and as he was much too excited to be in the least
sleepy he found no great difficulty in carrying out this part of his
scheme

He had heard the conversation accompanying Mr Cobbs unexpected
entrance and had waited anxiously to ask concerning the visitors
identity When assured by his sister that Santa had not arrived ahead
of time he settled down again to wait as patiently as he could for the
grownups to retire

So he waited and waited The clock struck ten and then eleven Georgie
rose tiptoed to his door and listened There were no sounds except
those of the storm Then still on tiptoe the boy crept along the hall
to the front stairs down these stairs and into the livingroom The
fire in the airtight stove showed red behind the isinglass panes and
the room was warm and comfortable

Georgie did not hesitate his plan was complete to the minutest details
By the light from the stove he found his way to the sofa which stood
against the wall on the side of the room opposite the windows There was
a heavy fringe on the sofa which hung almost to the floor The youngster
lay flat upon the floor and crept under the fringe and beneath the sofa
There he lay still Aunt Thankful and Captain Obed and Imogene had said
there was a Santa Claus the boy in South Middleboro had said there was
none Georgie meant to settle the question for himself this very night
This was his plan to hide in that livingroom and wait until Santa
cameif he came at all

It was lonely and dark and stuffy under the sofa and the beat of the
rain and the howling gale outside were scary sounds for a youngster no
older than he But Georgie was plucky and determined beyond his years
He was tempted to give up and scamper upstairs again but he fought down
the temptation If no Santa Claus came then he should know the Leary boy
was right If he did come thenwell then his only care must be not to
be caught watching

Twelve oclock struck Georgies eyes were closing He blinked owllike
under the fringe at the red glow behind the isinglass His head
pillowed upon his outstretched arms felt heavy and drowsy He must keep
awake he MUST So in order to achieve this result he began to count
the ticks of the big clock in the corner Onetwothreeand so on up
to twentytwo He lost count then his eyes closed opened and closed
again His thoughts drifted away from the clock drifted toto   

His eyes opened again There was a sound in the room a strange new
sound No it was not in the room it was in the diningroom He heard
it again Someone in that diningroom was moving cautiously The door
between the rooms was open and he could hear the sound of careful
footsteps

Georgie was frightened very much frightened He was seized with a panic
desire to scream and rush upstairs He did not scream but he thrust
one bare foot from beneath the sofa Then he hastily drew it in again
for the person in the diningroom whoever he or she might be was
coming toward the door

A moment later there was a scratching sound and the livingroom was
dimly illumined by the flare of a match The small and trembling watcher
beneath the sofa shut his eyes in fright When he opened them the lamp
upon the center table was lighted and Santa Claus himself was standing
by the table peering anxiously about

It was SantaGeorgie made up his mind to that immediately There was
the pack the pack which the pictured Santa Claus always carried to
prove it although in this instance the pack was but a small and rather
dirty bundle There were other points of difference between the real
Santa and the pictures for instance instead of being clothed entirely
in furs this ones apparel seemed to be for the most part rags and
soaked and dripping rags at that But he did wear a fur cap a mangy one
which looked like a drowned cat and his beard though ragged like his
garments was all that might be desired Yes it was Santa Claus who had
come just as they said he would althoughand Georgies doubts were so
far justifiedhe had NOT come down the livingroom chimney

Santa was cold it seemed for his first move was to go to the stove and
stand by it shivering and warming his hands During this operation he
kept looking fearfully about him and apparently listening Then to
Georgies chagrin and disappointment he took up the lamp and tiptoed
into the diningroom again However he had not gone for good for his
pack was still upon the floor where he had dropped it And a few minutes
later he reappeared his pockets bulging and in his free hand the
remains of half a ham which Georgie himself had seen Aunt Thankful put
away in the pantry

He replaced the lamp on the table and from his pockets extracted the end
of a loaf of bread several doughnuts and a halfdozen molasses cookies
Then he seated himself in a chair by the stove and proceeded to eat
hungrily voraciously first the ham and bread and then the doughnuts
and cookies And as he ate he looked and listened occasionally starting
as if in alarm

At last when he had eaten everything but the ham bone he rose to his
feet and turned his attention to the pack upon the floor This was what
Georgie had been waiting for and as Santa fumbled with the pack his
back to the sofa the boy parted the fringe and peered at him with eager
expectation

The pack according to every story Georgie had been told should have
been bulging with presents but if the latter were there they were under
more old clothes even worse than those the Christmas saint was wearing
Santa Claus hurriedly pawed over the upper layer and then took out a
little package wrapped in tissue paper Untying the string he exposed a
small pasteboard box and from this box he lifted some cotton and thena
ring

It was a magnificent ring so Georgie thought It had a big green stone
in the center and the rest was gold or what looked like gold Santa
seemed to think well of it too for he held it to the lamplight and
moved it back and forth watching the shine of the green stone Then
he put the ring down tore a corner from the piece of tissue paper
rummaged the stump of a pencil out of his rags and humping himself
over the table seemed to be writing

It took him a long time and was plainly hard work for he groaned
occasionally and kept putting the point of the pencil into his mouth
Georgies curiosity grew stronger each second Unconscious of what he
was doing he parted the fringe still more and thrust out his head for a
better view The top of his head struck the edge of the sofa with a dull
thump

Santa Claus jumped as if someone had stuck a pin into him and turned
That portion of his face not covered by the scraggly beard was as white
as mud and dirt would permit

Whowho be YOU he demanded in a frightened whisper

Georgie was white and frightened also but he manfully crept out from
beneath the sofa

Who be you repeated Santa

IIm Georgie stammered the boy

Georgie Georgie who

Georgie Hobbs Thethe boy that lives here

Liveslives HERE

Yes It seemed strange that the person reputed to know all the
children in the world did not recognize him at sight

Apparently he did not however for after an instant of silent and shaky
inspection he said

You mean to say you live herein this house Who do you live with

Mrs Barnes her that owns the house

Santa gasped audibly Youyou live with HER he demanded Good Lord
Sheshe aint married again is she

Married Nono sir she aint married

ThenthenSee here boy whats your nameyour whole name

George Ellis Hobbs Im Mr Hobbss boy up to South Middleboro you
know Im down here stayin with Aunt Thankful She

Sshh sshh Dont talk so loud So youre Mr Hobbss boy eh
Whateh Oh yes yes Youre ma waswas Sarah Cahoon want she

Yes sir II hope you wont be cross because I hid under the sofa
They said you were coming but I wasnt sure and II thought Id hide
and see if you did Please the tears rushed to Georgies eyes at the
dreadful thoughtplease dont be cross and go away without leaving me
anything Ill never do so again honest I wont

Santa seemed to have heard only the first part of this plea for
forgiveness He put a hand to his forehead

They said I was comin he repeated They saidWHO said so

Why everybody Aunt Thankful and Emily and Imogene and Capn Bangs and
Mr Parker andall of em They knew you was comin tonight but I

They knew it Boy are you crazy

Georgie shook his head

No sir Then as Santa Claus sat staring blankly with open mouth and
fingers plucking nervously at what seemed to be the only button on his
coat he added Please sir did you bring the airgun

Hey

Did you bring the airgun I wanted They said you probably wouldnt
but I do want it like everything I wont shoot the hens honest I
wont

Santa Claus picked at the button

Say boy he asked slowly Who am I

Georgie was surprised

Why Santa Claus he replied You are Santa Claus aint you

Eh San    Oh yes yes Im Santa Claus thats who I be He
seemed relieved but still anxious After fidgeting a moment he added
Well I callate Ill have to be goin now

Georgie turned pale

Butbut where are the presents he wailed II thought you wasnt
goin to be cross with me Im awfully sorry I stayed up to watch for
you I wont ever do it again PLEASE dont go away and not leave me any
presents Please Mr Santa Claus

Santa started Sshh he commanded in an agonized whisper Hush up
Somebodyll hear    Eh Whats that

The front stairs creaked ominously Georgie did not answer he made a
headlong dive for his hidingplace beneath the sofa Santa seemed to be
even more alarmed than the youngster He glanced wildly about the room
and as another creak came from the stairs darted into the diningroom

For a minute or more nothing happened Then the door leading to the
front hall the door which had been standing ajar opened cautiously and
Mrs Barnes head protruded beyond its edge She looked about the room
then she entered Emily Howes followed Both ladies wore wrappers now
and Thankfuls hand clutched an umbrella the only weapon available
which she had snatched from the hall rack as she passed it She advanced
to the center table

Whos here she demanded firmly Who lit this lamp Georgie Georgie
Hobbs we know youre here somewhere for we heard you Show yourself
this instant

Silencethen Emily seized her cousins arm and pointed A small bare
foot protruded from beneath the sofa fringe Thankful marched to the
sofa and stooping grasped the ankle above the foot

Georgie Hobbs she ordered come out from under this sofa

Georgie came partly of his own volition partly because of the
persuasive tug at his ankle

Now then ordered Thankful what are you doin down here Answer
me

Georgie did not answer He marked a circle on the floor with his toe

What are you doin down here repeated Mrs Barnes Did you light
that lamp

Nom replied Georgie

Of course he didnt Auntie whispered Emily There was someone here
with him I heard them talking

Who did light it

Georgie marked another circle Santa Claus he muttered faintly

Thankful stared first at the boy and then at her cousin

Mercy on us she exclaimed The childs gone crazy Christmas has
struck to his head

But Emilys fears were not concerning her small brothers sanity Hush
Auntie she whispered Hush He was talking to someone We both heard
another voice WHO did you say it was Georgie

Santa Claus Oh Emmie please dont be mad II wanted to see him
soandand when he came II

There there Georgie dont cry dear Were not cross You were
talking to someone you thought was Santa Where is he

He WAS Santa Claus He SAID he was He went away when you cameinto
the dininroom

The diningroom    Auntie WHAT are you doing Dont

But Thankful had seized the lamp and was already at the threshold of the
diningroom Holding the light aloft she peered into that apartment

If theres anybody here she ordered theyd better come out because
   Here I see you under that table I

She stopped gasped and staggered back Emily running to her side was
just in time to prevent the lamp falling to the floor

Oh Auntie cried the young lady Auntie what IS it

Thankful did not answer Her face was white and she moved her hands
helplessly And there in the doorway of the diningroom appeared Santa
Claus and if ever Santa Claus looked scared and apprehensive he did at
that moment

Emily stared at him Mrs Barnes uttered a groan Santa Claus smiled
feebly

Hello Thankful he said II callate youre surprised to see me
aint you

Thankfuls lips moved

Areare you livin oror dead she gasped

MeOh Im alive but thats about all Hey Its Emily aint it
Whywhy Emily dont you know me

Miss Howes put the lamp down upon the table Then she leaned heavily
upon a chair back

Cousin Jedediah she exclaimed It cant beitAuntie

But Thankful interrupted She turned to Georgie

Isis THIS your Santa Claus she faltered

Yesm answered Georgie

Jedediah Cahoon cried Thankful Jedediah Cahoon

For Georgies Santa Claus was her brother the brother who had run
away from her home so long ago to seek his fortune in the Klondike
whose letter written in San Francisco and posted in Omaha had reached
her the month before whom the police of several cities were looking for
at her behest

Auntie cried Emily again

Thankful shook her head Help me to a chair Emily she begged weakly
Thisthis ismy soul and body Jedediah come alive again

The returned goldhunter swallowed several times

Thankful he faltered I know you must feel pretty hard agin me
butbut you see

You didnt write before Let me be Emily you dont know what Ive gone
through on account of him and now he comes sneakin into my house in the
middle of the night without a word that he was comin sneakin in like

Jedediah interrupted Sneakin in he repeated with a desperate move
of his hands I had to sneak in I was scairt to come in when you

Sos youd dare come in What did you want to come in for if I want

I wanted to leave a note for you thats why I wanted to leave a note
andand that

He pointed to the ring and the bit of tissue paper on the table
Thankful took up the paper first and read aloud what was written upon
it


For Thankful with a larst merry Christmas from brother Jed I am going
away and if you want me I will be at New Bedford for two weeks care the
bark Finback


I am goin away repeated Thankful Goin away Are you goin away

Cook You a cook And she took up the ring and stared at it for the
land sakes whats this

Its a present I bought for you Took my last two dollar bill it did
I wanted you to have somethin to remember me by

Thankful held the gaudy ring at arms length and stared at it
helplessly There was a curious expression on her face halfway between
laughing and crying

You bought thisthis thing for me she repeated And did you think
Id wear it

I hoped you would Oh Thankful if you only knew what Ive been
through Why I was next door to starvin when I got in here tonight
If I hadnt eat somethin I found in the buttry I would have starved I

you much I guess Youre just as helpless as ever you was Well youre
here and Im grateful for so much Now you come with me out into the
kitchen and well see what can be done about gettin you dry Emily if
youll just put that child to bed

But Georgie had something to say He had listened to this long dialogue
with astonishment and growing dismay Now the dismay and conviction of a
great disappointment overcame him

I dont want to go to bed he wailed Aint he Santa Claus He SAID
he was Santa Claus Where are my presents Wheres my airgun I want my
presents OhOhOh

He went out crying Emily ran to him

Hush hush Georgie dear she begged Come upstairs with
sistercome If you dont you may be here when the real Santa comes and
you will frighten him away Come with me thats a good boy Auntie I
will be down by and by

She led the disappointed and still sobbing boy from the room Thankful
turned to her brother

Now you march out into that kitchen she commanded Ill get you warm
first and then Ill see about a bed for you Youll have to sleep up on
the third floor tonight After that Ill see about a better room to put

Jedediah stared at her

repeated Ive been workin heavens and earth to get you back ever
since I got that pitiful letter of yours You poor thing You MUST have
had a hard time of it Well you can tell me all about it by and by Now
you march into that kitchen

Another hour had passed before Mrs Barnes reentered the livingroom
There to her astonishment she found Emily awaiting her

Why for goodness sakes cried Thankful What are you doin here I
thought youd gone to bed long ago

Emilys reply was given in an odd tone She did not look at her cousin
when she spoke

No no she said quickly II havent gone to bed

I see you havent but why

I didnt want to IIm not sleepy

Not sleepy At two oclock in the mornin Well with a sigh I
suppose taint to be wondered at Whats happened this night is enough
to keep anybody awake I cant believe it even yet To think of his
comin back after Ive given him up for dead twice over Its like a
storybook

Where is he

Up in bed in one of the attic rooms If he hasnt got his death of
cold itll be a wonder And SUCH yarns as hes been spinnin to me
IEmily whats the matter with you What makes you act so queer

Emily did not answer Mrs Barnes walked across the room and stooping
peered into her face

Youre white as a sheet she cried in alarm And youre tremblin
all over What in the world IS the matter

Emily tried to smile but it was a poor attempt

Nothing nothing Auntie she said That is IIm sure it cant be
anything to be afraid of

But you are afraid just the same What is it Tell me this minute

For the first time Emily looked her cousin in the face

Auntie she whispered I amI have been frightened Something I
heard upstairs frightened me

Somethin you heard upstairs Where Has Georgie

No Georgie is asleep in his room I locked the door It wasnt
Georgie it was something else

SomethinEmily Howes do you want to scare me to DEATH What IS it

I dont know what it is I heard it first when I came out of Georgies
room a few minutes ago Then I went down the hall to his door and
listened Aunt Thankful hehe is in there talkingtalking to
someone

He Talkin Who

Mr Cobb It was dreadful He was talking totoI dont know WHAT he
was talking to but it was awful to hear

Talkin Solomon Cobb was talkin In his sleep do you mean

No he wasnt asleep He was talking to someone or some THING in that
room And that wasnt all I heardI heardOh I DID hear it I know I
did And yet it couldnt be It couldnt

Emily Howes if you keep on IllWHAT did you hear

I dont know    Aunt Thankful where are you going

Thankful did not answer She was on her way to the front hall and the
stairs Emily rushed after her and would have detained her if she could
but Thankful would not be detained Up the stairs they went together and
along the narrow dark hall At the end of the hall was the door of the
back bedroom or the larger room adjoining it The door was closed
but from beneath it shone lamplight in sharp yellow streaks And from
behind it came faintly the sound of a deep groan the groan of a soul in
agony

Hes sick whispered Thankful The mans sick Im goin to him

He isnt sick Itits something else I tell you I heard

Thankful did not wait to learn what her cousin had heard She tiptoed
down the hall and Emily followed The two women crouched beside
the closed door of Mr Cobbs room And within that room they heard
Solomons voice now rising almost to a shriek now sinking to a groan
as its owner raved on and on talking pleading praying

Oh dontdont Abner cried Mr Cobb Dont no more PLEASE
dont I know what you mean I know it all Im sorry I know I aint
done right But Ill MAKE it right I swear to the Almighty I will I
know Ive broke my word to you and acted wicked and mean but I give you
my solemn word Ill make everything right Only just quit and go away
thats all I ask Just quit thatOh there you GO again QUIT PLEASE
quit

It was dreadful to hear but this was not the most dreadful Between the
agonized sentences and whenever the wind lulled the listeners at the
door heard another sound a longdrawn gasp and groan a series of gasps
and groans as of something fighting for breath the unmistakable sound
of snoring

Emily grasped her cousins arm Come come away she whispered II
believe Im going to faint

Mrs Barnes did not wait to be urged She put her arm about the young
ladys waist and together they tiptoed back to Thankfuls bedroom
There Mrs Barness first move was to light the lamp the second to
close and lock the door Then the pair sat down one upon the bed and
the other on a chair and gazed into each others pale faces

Emily was the first to speak

II dont believe it she declared shakily I KNOW it isnt real

Soso do I

Butbut we heard it We both heard it

Wellwell I give in II heard somethin somethin that    My
soul Am I goin CRAZY to finish off this night with

I dont know If you are then I must be going with you What can it
be Auntie

I dont know

There is no other door to that room is there

No

Then what CAN it be

I dont know Imogenes in her own room I looked in and saw her when
I took Jedediah up attic And Georgies in his with the door locked
And you and I are here There cant be a livin soul in that room with
Solomon not a livin soul

But we heardwe both heard

I know I know And I heard somethin there before And so did Miss
Timpson Emily diddid you hear him callcall it Abner

Yes with a shudder I heard Who could help hearing

And Capn Abner was my uncle and he used to live here    There
with sudden determination Thats enough of this Well both be stark
ravin distracted if we keep on this way My soul Hear that wind I
said once that all the big things in my life had happened durin a storm
and so they have Jedediah went away in a storm and hes come back in
a storm And now if UNCLE ABNERS comin back    There I go again
Emily do you feel like goin to bed

To BED After THAT Auntie how can you

All right then well set up till mornin Turn that lamp as high as
you can and well set by it and wait for daylight By that time we may
have some of our sense back again and not behave like two feebleminded
fools Turn that wick upWAY up Emily Howes And talktalk just as
hard as you canabout somethin or somebody thats ALIVE




CHAPTER XVI


Emily obeyed orders as far as turning up the wick was concerned and she
did her best to talk It was hard work both she and her cousin found
themselves breaking off a sentence in the middle to listen and draw
closer together as the wild gusts whistled about the windows and the
water poured from the sashes and gurgled upon the sills Occasionally
Thankful went to the door to look down the dark hall in the direction
of Mr Cobbs room or to unlock Georgies door and peer in to make sure
that the boy was safe and sleeping

From the third of these excursions Mrs Barnes returned with a bit of
reassuring news

I went almost there this time she whispered My conscience has been
tormenting me to think ofof Solomons bein alone in there withwith
THAT and I almost made up my mind to sing out and ask if he was all
right But I didnt have to thank goodness His lights still lit and I
heard him movin around so he aint been scared clean to death at any
rate For the rest of it I dont care so much a good hard scarin may
do him good He needs one If ever a stingy old reprobate needed to have
a warnin from the hereafter that man does

Did you hear anythinganything else whispered Emily fearfully

No I didnt and I didnt wait for fear I MIGHT hear it Did I lock
the door when I came in Emily I guess you think Im the silliest old
coward that ever was I amand I know it Tomorrow well both be brave
enough and well both KNOW there aint any spirits here or anywhere
else this side of the grave but tonightwell tonights different
   Ouch what was that There there dont mind my jumpin I feel
as if Id been stuffed with springs like a sofa Did you ever know a
night as long as this Wont mornin EVER come

At five oclock while it was still pitch dark Thankful announced her
intention of going downstairs Might as well be in the kitchen as up
here she said and I can keep busy till Imogene comes down And
besides wed better be puttin Georgies stockin and his presents in
the livinroom The poor little shavers got to have his Christmas
even though his Santa Claus did turn out to be a walkin ragbag

Emily started Why it is Christmas isnt it she exclaimed
Between returned brothers and with a little shiver ghosts I forgot
entirely

She kissed her cousins cheek

A merry Christmas Aunt Thankful she said

Thankful returned the kiss Same to you dearie and many of em she
replied Well heres another Christmas day come to me A year ago I
didnt think Id be here I wonder where Ill be next Christmas Will
I have a home of my own or will what Ive thought was my home belong to
Sol Cobb or Holliday Kendrick

Hush Auntie hush Your home wont be taken from you It would be too
mean too dreadful God wont permit such a thing

I sartin hope he wont but it seems sometimes as if he permitted some
mighty mean things cordin to our way of lookin at em That lights
still burnin she added peering out into the hall Well I suppose I
ought to pity Solomon but I dont when I think how hes treated me
If the ghostor whatever tis in thereweeded out the rest of his
whiskers for him I dont knows Id care Twould serve him right I
guess

They rehung Georgies stockingbulging and knobby it was nowand
arranged his more bulky presents beneath it on the floor Then Thankful
went into the kitchen and Emily accompanied her The morning broke
pale and gray The wind had subsided and it no longer rained With the
returning daylight Emilys courage began to revive

I cant understand she said how you and I could have been so
childish last night We should have insisted on calling to Mr Cobb and
then we should have found out what it was that frightened him and us I
mean to go over every inch of those two rooms before dinner time

Thankful nodded Ill do it with you she said But Ive been over
em so many times that Im pretty skeptical The time to go over em is
in the night when thatthat snorin is goin on A ghost that snores
ought by rights to be one thats asleep and a soundasleep ghost
ought to be easy to locate Oh yes I can make fun NOW I told you I
was as brave as a lionin the daytime

It was easy to talk now and they drifted into a discussion of many
things Thankful retold the story of her struggle to keep the High Cliff
House afloat told it all her hopes her fears and her discouragements
They spoke of Captain Bangs of his advice and help and friendship
Emily brought the captain into the conversation and kept him there
Thankful said little concerning him and of the one surprising intimate
interview between Captain Obed and herself she said not a word She
it was who first mentioned John Kendricks name Emily was at first
disinclined to speak of the young lawyer but little by little as her
cousin hinted and questioned she said more and more Thankful learned
what she wished to learn and it was what she had suspected She learned
something else too something which concerned another citizen of East
Wellmouth

I knew it she cried I didnt believe twas so and I as much as
told Capn Obed twasnt this very dayno yesterday I mean When a
body dont go to bed at all the days kind of run into one another

What did you know asked Emily What were you and Captain Obed
talking of that concerned me

Nothin nothin dear It didnt concern you one bit and twasnt
important    Hi hum rising and looking out of the window
Its gettin brighter fast now Looks as if we might have a pleasant
Christmas after all Wonder how poor Jedediahll feel when he wakes up
I hope he slept warm anyhow I piled on comforters and quilts enough to
smother him

Her attempt at changing the subject was successful Emilys next
question concerned Jedediah

What are you goin to do with him Auntie she asked He must stay
here mustnt he

Course he must Ill never trust him out of my sight again He aint
competent to take care of himself and so Ill have to take care of him
Well with a sigh itll only be natural thats all Ive been used
to takin care of somebody all my days I wonder how twould seem to
have somebody take care of me for a change Not that theres liable to
be anybody doin it she added hastily

Jedediah might be useful to work about the place here said Emily
You will always need a hired man you know

Yes but I dont need two and I couldnt discharge Kenelm on Imogenes
account What that girl ever got engaged to that old image for is moren
I can make out or ever shall

Emily smiled I shouldnt worry about Imogene she said I think she
knows perfectly well what she is about

Maybe so but if she does then her kind of knowledge is different from
mine If I was goin to marry anybody in that family twould be Hannah
shes the most man of the two

Imogene herself came down a few minutes later She was much surprised
to find her mistress and Miss Howes dressed and in the kitchen Also she
was very curious

Whos that man she asked the one in the next room to mine up
attic Is he a new boarder He must have come awful late I heard you
and him talkin in the middle of the night Who is he

When told the story of Jedediahs return she was greatly excited

Why its just like somethin in a story she cried Longlost folks
are always comin back in stories And comin Christmas Eve makes it all
the better LordyThere I aint said that for weeks and weeks Excuse
me Mrs Thankful I WONT say it again Butbut what are we goin to
do with him Is he goin to stay here for good

Thankful answered that she supposed he was he had no other place to
stay

Is he rich He ought to be Folks in stories always come home rich
after theyve run off

Well this one didnt He missed connections somehow Rich No
drily he aint rich

Well what will he do Will we have to take care of himfree I mean
Excuse me for buttin in maam but it does seem as if we had enough on
our hands without takin another free boarder

Thankful went into the diningroom Emily when the question was
repeated to her suggested that possibly Jedediah might work about
the place take care of the livestock and of the garden when there was
one

Imogene reflected Hum she mused We dont need two hired hands
thats a sure thing You mean hell take Kenelms job

That isnt settled so you mustnt speak of it I know my cousin will
be very sorry to let Kenelm go largely on your account Imogene

On my account

Why yes You and he are engaged to be married and of course you like
to have him here

Imogene burst out laughing Dont you worry about that Miss Emily
she said I shant and I dont think Kenelm will either

Breakfast was ready at last and they were just sitting down to the
tableit had been decided not to call Jedediah or Mr Cobbwhen
Georgie appeared The boy had crept downstairs his small head filled
with forebodings but the sight of the knobby stocking and the heap of
presents sent his fears flying and he burst into the room with a
shriek of joy One by one the packages were unwrapped and with each
unwrapping the youngsters excitement rose

Gee he cried as he sat in the middle of the heap of toys and
brown paper and looked about him Gee Theyre all here everything I
wantedbut that airgun I dont care though Maybe Ill get that next
Christmas Or maybe Capn Bangsll give it to me anyhow He gives me
most anything if I tease for it

Thankful shook her head You see Georgie she said it pays to be
a good boy If Santa had caught you hidin under that sofa and watchin
for him last night you might not have got any of these nice things

Georgie did not answer immediately When he did it was in a rather
doubtful tone

There aint any soot on em anyhow he observed And they aint wet
either

Imogene clapped her hand to her mouth and hurried from the room You
cant fool that kid much she whispered to Emily afterward Hes the
smartest kid ever I saw Ill keep out of his way for a while I dont
want to have to answer his questions

There were other presents besides those given to Georgie presents for
Emily from Thankful and for Thankful from Emily and for Imogene from
both There was nothing costly of course but no one cared for that

As they were beginning breakfast Jedediah appeared His garments which
had been drying by the kitchen stove all night and which Imogene had
deposited in a heap at his bedroom door were wrinkled but his face
shone from the vigorous application of soap and water and as his sister
said afterward You could see his complexion without diggin for it
and that was somethin

His manner was subdued and he was very very polite and anxious to
please but his appetite was in good order Introduced to Imogene he
expressed himself as pleased to meet her Georgie he greeted with some
hesitation evidently the memory of his midnight encounter with the boy
embarrassed him But Georgie when he learned that the shabby person
whom he was told to call Uncle Jed was although only an imitation
Santa Claus a genuine goldhunter and traveler who had seen real
Esquimaux and polar bears warmed to his new relative immediately

When the meal was over Jedediah made what was for him an amazing
suggestion

Now he said I callate Id better be gettin to work hadnt I
Whatll I do first Thankful

Mrs Barnes stared at him Work she repeated What do you mean

I mean I want to be doin somethinsomethin to help you know I
dont callate to stay around here and loaf No SIR

Thankful drew a long breath All right Jed she said You can go
out in the barn and feed the horse if you want to KenelmMr
Parkergenerally does it but he probably wont be here for quite a
spell yet Go ahead Imogenell show you what to do    But say
hold on she added with emphasis Dont you go off the premises and
if you see anybody comin keep out of sight I dont want anybody to
see a brother of mine in THOSE clothes Soons ever I can Ill go up
to the village and buy you somethin to wear if its only an ilskin
jacket and a pair of overalls Theyll cover up the rags anyhow As
you are now you look like one of Georgies picturepuzzles partly put
together

When the eager applicant for employment had gone under Imogenes
guidance Emily spoke her mind

Auntie she said are you going to make him worknow after what
hes been through and on Christmas day too

Thankful was still staring after her brother

Sshh sshh she commanded Dont speak to me for a minute you may
wake me up Jedediah Cahoon ASKIN to go to work All the miracles in
Scriptur are nothin to this

But Auntie he did ask And do you think he is strong enough

Hush Emily hush You dont know Jedediah Strong enough Im the one
that needs strength if Im goin to have shocks like this one sprung on
me

Emily said no more but she noticed that her cousin was wearing the
twodollar ring the wanderers farewell gift so she judged that
brother Jed would not be worked beyond the bounds of moderation

Left alone in the diningroomGeorgie had returned to the livingroom
and his presentsthe two women looked at each other Neither had eaten
a breakfast worth mentioning and the same thought was in the mind of
each

Auntie whispered Emily voicing that thought dont you think we
ought to go up andand see if he isall right

Thankful nodded Yes she said I suppose we had Hes alive I know
that much for I had Imogene knock on his door just now and he answered
But I guess maybe wed better

She did not finish the sentence for at that moment the subject of the
conversation entered the room It was Solomon Cobb who entered but
except for his clothes he was a changed man His truculent arrogance
was gone he came in slowly and almost as if he were walking in his
sleep His collar was unbuttoned his hair had not been combed and the
face between the thin bunches of whiskers was white and drawn He did
not speak to either Emily or Thankful but dragging one foot after the
other crossed the room and sat down in a chair by the window

Thankful spoke to him

Are you sick Solomon she asked

Mr Cobb shook his head

Eh he grunted No no I aint sick I guess I aint I dont know

Breakfast is all ready Mr Cobb suggested Emily

Solomon turned a weary eye in her direction He looked old very old

Breakfast he repeated feebly Dont talk about breakfast to me Ill
never eat again in this world

Thankful pitied him she could not help it

Oh yes you will she said heartily Just try one of those clam
fritters of Imogenes and youll eat a whole lot If you dont youll be
the first one

He shook his head Thankful he said slowly II want to talk to
you Ive got to talk to youalone

Alone Why Emilys just the same as one of the family Theres no
secrets between us Solomon

I dont care I want to talk to you Its you Ive got to talk to

Thankful would have protested once more but Emily put a hand on her
arm

Ill go into the livingroom with Georgie Auntie she whispered
Yes I shall

She went and closed the door behind her Thankful sat down in a chair
wondering what was coming next Solomon did not look at her but after
a moment he spoke

Thankful Cahoon he said calling her by her maiden name IIve
been a bad man Im goin to hell

Thankful jumped Mercy on us she cried What kind of talk

Im goin to hell repeated Solomon When a man does the way Ive
done thats where he goes Im goin there and Im goin pretty soon
Ive had my notice

Thankful stood up She was convinced that her visitor had been driven
crazy by his experience in the back bedroom

Now now now she faltered Dont talk so wicked Solomon Cobb
Youve been a church man for years and a professor of religion You
told me so yourself How can you set there and say

Mr Cobb waved his hand

Dont make no difference he moaned Or if it does it only makes it
worse I know where Im goin butbut Ill go with a clean manifest
anyhow Ill tell you the whole thing I promised the dead I would and
I will Thankful Cahoon Ive been a bad man to you I swore my solemn
oath as a Christian to one that was my best friend and I broke it

Years ago I swore by all that was good and great Id look out for you
and see that you was comftable and happy longs you lived And instead
of that when I come here last nightLED here I know now that I
wasmy mind was about made up to take your home away from you if I
could Yes sir I was callatin to foreclose on you and sell this
place to Kendrick I thought I was mighty smart and was doin a good
stroke of business No mortal man could have made me think diffrent
BUT AN IMMORTAL ONE DID

He groaned and wiped his forehead Thankful did not speak her surprise
and curiosity were too great for speech

Twas your Uncle Abner Barnes went on Solomon that was the makin
of me I sailed fust mate for him fourteen year And he always treated
me fine raised my wages right along and the like of that Twas him
that put me in the way of investin my money in them sugar stocks and
the rest He made me rich or headed me that way And when he lost all
he had except this place here and was dyin aboard the old schooner he
calls me to him and he says

Sol he says Sol Ive done considerble for you and youve said
you was grateful Well Im goin to ask a favor of you I aint got a
cent of my own left and my niece by marriage Thankful Cahoon that was
that I love same as if she was my own child may sometime or other
be pretty hard put to it to get along I want you to look after her If
ever the time comes that she needs money or help I want you to do for
her what Id do if I was here If you dont he says risin on one
elbow in the bunk Ill come back and hant you Promise on your solemn
oath And I promised And you know how Ive kept that promise And last
night he come back Yes sir he come back

Still Thankful said nothing He groaned again and went on

Last night he said up in that bedroom I woke up and as sure as
Im settin here this minute I heard Capn Abner Barnes snorin just
as he snored afore his death aboard the schooner T I Smalley in the
stateroom next to mine I knew it in a minute but I got up and went all
round my room and the empty one alongside There was nothin there of
course Nothin but the snorin And I got down on my knees and swore to
set things right this very day Give me a pen and ink and some paper

Eh What

Give me a pen and some ink and paper Dont sit there starin Hurry
up Cant you see I want to get this thing off my chest afore I die
Andand II wouldnt be surprised if I died any minute Hurry UP

Thankful went into the livingroom in search of the writing materials
Emily who was sitting on the floor with Georgie and the presents
turned to ask a question

What is it Auntie she whispered eagerly Is it anything
important

Her cousin made an excited gesture

II dont know she whispered in reply Either hes been driven
looney by what happened last night or elseor else somethins goin to
happen that I dont dast to believe Emily you stand right here by the
door I may want you

Wheres that pen and things queried Solomon from the next room
Aint you ever comin

When the writing materials were brought and placed upon the diningroom
table he drew his chair to that table and scrawled a few lines

Somebody ought to witness this he cried nervously Some
disinterested person ought to witness this Then twill hold in law
Wheres thatthat Howes girl Oh here you be Here you sign that as a
witness

Emily who had entered at the mention of her name took the paper from
his trembling fingers She read what was written upon it

Whywhy Auntie she cried excitedly Aunt Thankful have you seen
this He

Stop your talk shouted Solomon Cant you women do nothin BUT talk
Sign your name alongside of mine as a witness

Emily took the pen and signed as directed Mr Cobb snatched the paper
from her glanced at it and then handed it to Thankful

There he cried Thats done anyhow Ive done so much Nownow
dont say a word to me for a spell IIm all in thats what I am all
in

Thankful did not say a word she couldnt have said it at that moment
Upon the paper which she held in her hand was written a cancellation of
the fifteenhundreddollar mortgage and a receipt in full for the loan
itself signed by Solomon Cobb

Dimly and uncomprehendingly she heard Emily trying to thank their
visitor But thanks he would not listen to

No no no he shouted Go away and let me alone Im a wicked
condemned critter Nobodys ever cared a durn for me nobody but one
and I broke my word to him Friendless Ive lived since Abner went and
friendless Ill die Serve me right I aint got a livin soul of my own
blood in the world

But Thankful was in a measure herself again

Dont talk so Solomon she cried You have got somebody of your own
blood Im a relation of yours even if tis a faroff relation II
dont know how to thank you for this I

He interrupted again

Yes he wailed youre my relation I know it Think that makes it
any better Look how Ive treated you No no Im goin to die and
go

Youre goin to have breakfast thats what youre goin to have And
it shant be warmed up fried clams either Emily you stay with him Im
goin to the kitchen

She fled to the kitchen where between fits of crying and laughing
which would have alarmed Imogene had she been there she tried to
prepare a breakfast which might tempt the repentant moneylender Emily
joined her after a short interval

He wont listen to anything said the young lady He has been
frightened almost to death thats certain He is praying now I came
away and left him praying Oh Auntie isnt it wonderful Isnt it
splendid

Thankful sighed Its so wonderful I can scarcely believe it she
said To think of his givin up moneygivin it away of his own
accord I said last night that Jedediahs comin home was a miracle
This one beats that all to pieces I dont know what to do about takin
that thousand from him she added I declare I dont Course I shant
take it in the long run Ill pay it back soon as ever I can But should
I pretend to take it now Thats what troubles me

Of course you should He is rich and he doesnt need it What have you
done with that receipt Put it away somewhere and in a safe place He
is frightened thatthat something whatever it was last
nightfrightened him so that he will give away anything now But by
and by when his fright is over he may change his mind Lock up that
paper Aunt Thankful If you dont I will

But what was it that frightened him Emily I declare Im gettin
afraid to stay in this house myself What was it he heardand we
heard

I dont know but I mean to find out Im a sensible person this
morning not an idiot and I intend to lay that ghost

When they went back into the diningroom they were surprised at what
they saw Solomon was still sitting by the window but Georgie was
sitting in a chair beside him exhibiting the pictures in one of
his Christmas books and apparently on the best of terms with his new
acquaintance

Im showin him my Swiss Family Robinson said the boy Heres
where they built a house in a tree Mr Cobb Emmie told me about their
doin it

Solomon groaned

You better take this child away from me he said He came to me of
his own accord but he hadnt ought to stay A man like me aint fit to
have children around him

Thankful had an inspiration

Its a sign she cried clapping her hands Its a sign sent to you
Solomon It means youre forgiven Thats what it means Now you eat
your breakfast

He was eating or trying to eat when someone knocked at the door
Winnie S Holt was standing on the step

Merry Christmas Mrs Barnes he hailed Aint drowned out after the
gale be you Judas priest Our place is afloat Dad says he callates
well have to build a raft to get to the henhouse on Here heres
somethin Mr Kendrick sent to you Wanted me to give it to you
yourself and nobody else

The something was a long envelope with Mrs Barnes Personal written
upon it Thankful read the inscription

From Mr Kendrick she repeated Which Mr Kendrick

Mr John the young one Mr Hollidays comin though He telephoned
from Bayport this mornin Came down on the cars fars there last night
but he didnt dast to come no further count of bein afraid to drive
from the Centre in the storm Hes hired an automobile and is comin
right over he says The message was for John Kendrick but Dad took it
Whats in the envelope Mrs Barnes

Thankful slowly tore the end from the envelope Emily stood at her
elbow

What can it be Auntie she asked fearfully

I dont know Im afraid to look Oh dear Its somethin bad I know
Somethin to do with that Holliday Kendrick it must be or he wouldnt
have come to East Wellmouth today IIwell I must look of course
Oh Emily and we thought this was goin to be a merry Christmas after
all

The enclosure was a long legallooking document Thankful unfolded it
read a few lines and then stopped reading

Whywhy she stammered

What is it Auntie pleaded Emily

ItI cant make out I MUST be crazy oror somebody is It looks
likeRead it Emily read it out loud




CHAPTER XVII


Captain Obed Bangs rose at his usual hour that Christmas morning and
the hour was an early one When he looked from his bedroom window the
clouds were breaking and a glance at his barometer hung on the wall
just beside that window showed the glass to be rising and confirmed
the promise of a fair day He dressed and came downstairs Hannah Parker
came down soon afterward The captain wished her a merry Christmas

Miss Parker shook her head she seemed to be in a pessimistic mood

Im much obliged to you Capn Bangs she said and Im sure I wish
you the same But I dont know dont seem as if I was liable to have
many more merry Christmases in this life No merry Christmases aint
for me Im a second fiddle nowadays and I callate thats what Im
foreordinated to be from now on

The captain didnt understand

Second fiddle he repeated What have you got to do with fiddlin
for goodness sakes

Nothin of course I dont mean a real fiddle I mean I shant never
be my own mistress any more Ive been layin awake thinkin about it
and shiverin twas so damp and chilly up in my room Theres a loose
shingle right over a knot hole thats abreast a crack in my bedroom
wall and it lets in the dampness like a sieve Ive asked Kenelm to fix
it MORE times but no all he cares to do is look out for himself and
that inmate If SHE had a loose shingle hed fix it quick enough All
I could do this mornin was lay to bed there and shiver and pull up the
quilt and think and think It kept comin over me more and more

The quilt you mean Thats what you wanted it to do wasnt it

Not the quilt The thought of the lonesome old age thats comin to me
when Kenelms married Ive had him to look after for so long Ive been
my own boss as they say

She might have added And Kenelms too but Captain Obed added it for
her in his mind He laughed

Thats all right Hannah he observed by way of consolation Kenelm
aint married yet When he is you can help his wife look out for him
Either that or get married Why dont you get married Hannah

Humph Dont be silly Obed Bangs

That aint silliness thats sense All you need to do is just hist
the signal Consort wanted and youd have one alongside in no time
Theres Caleb Hammond for instance hes a widower andeh look out

Miss Parker had dropped the plate she was just putting down upon the
table Fortunately it fell only a few inches and did not break

What do you mean by that she demanded sharply

I meant the plate Little more and youd have sent it to glory

Never you mind the plate I can look out for my own crockery Twas
cracked anyhow And I guess youre cracked too she added Talkin
about mymy marryin Caleb Hammond What put that in your head

I dont know I just

Well dont be silly When I marry Caleb Hammond she added with
emphasis twill be after THIS

So I callated I didnt think youd married him afore this There now
you missed a chance Hannah You and he ought to have got married that
time when you went away together

Miss Parker turned pale When we wentawayTOGETHER she faltered
WHAT are you talkin about

When you went over to the Cattle Show that time

Is that what you meant

Sartin What are you glarin at me that way for You aint been away
together any other time have you No Hannah that was your chance You
and Caleb might have been married in the balloon like the couples we
read about in the papers Ho ho Think of the advertisin youd have
had A high church weddin Bride and groom up in the air Cant you
see those headlines

Hannah appeared more relieved than annoyed

Humph she sniffed Well I should say YOU was up in the air Obed
Bangs Whats the matter with you this mornin Has the rain soaked into
your head It seems to be softenin up pretty fast If youre so set on
somebody gettin married why dont you get married yourself Youve been
what the minister calls unattackted all your life

The minister had said unattached but Captain Obed did not offer
to correct the quotation He joked no more and during breakfast was
silent and absentminded

After breakfast he went out for a walk The storm had gullied the hills
and flooded the hollows There were pools of water everywhere shining
cold and steely in the winter sunshine The captain remembered the low
ground in which the barn and outbuildings upon the Capn Abner place
stood and judged that he and Kenelm might have to do some rescue work
among the poultry later on He went back to the house to suggest that
work to Mr Parker himself

Kenelm and his sister were evidently in the midst of a dispute The
former was seated at the breakfast table and Hannah was standing by the
kitchen door looking at him

Goin off to work Christmas Day she said as the captain entered I
should think you might stay home with me THAT day if no other Taint
the work youre so anxious to get to Its that precious inmate of
yours

Kenelms answer was as surprising as it was emphatic

Darn the inmate he shouted I wish to thunder Id never seen her

Captain Obed whistled Miss Parker staggered but she recovered
promptly

Oh she said thats how you feel is it Well if I felt that way
toward anybody I dont think Id be plannin to marry em

Ugh Whats the use of talkin rubbish Ive GOT to marry her aint
I Shes got that paper I was fool enough to sign Oh let me alone
Hannah I wont go over there till I have to Id ruther stay to home
enough sight

Hannah put her arms about his neck There there Kenelm dearie she
said soothingly you eat your breakfast like a nice brother ILL be
good to you if nobody else aint And I didnt have to sign any paper
afore Id do it either

Kenelm grunted ungraciously

Twas your fault anyhow he muttered If you hadnt bossed me and
driven me into workin for Thankful Barnes twouldnt have happened I
wouldnt have thought of gettin engaged to be married

Never mind dearie You aint married yet Perhaps you wont be And
anyhow you know ILL never boss you any more

Kenelm looked at her There was an odd expression in his eyes

You bet you wont he said slowly Ill see to that

Why Kenelm what do you mean

I dont mean nothinmaybe Give me some more coffee

Captain Obed decided that the present was not the time to suggest a trip
to the High Cliff House He went out again to walk along the path and
think over what he had just heard It was interesting as showing the
attitude of one of the contracting parties toward the engagement the
announcement of which had been such a staggering finish to the big day
of the County Fair

Winnie S came whistling up the path from the village

Hi Capn Bangs he shouted I was just goin to stop at Hannahs to
tell you somethin

You was eh

Yup Then I was goin on to the High Cliff Ive got somethin to take
to Mrs Thankful What do you suppose tis

He exhibited the long envelope

John Kendrick sent it to her he said I dont know whats in it And
he wants you to come to his office right off Capn Obed Thats what
I was goin to tell you He says not to wait till afternoon same as he
said but to come now Its important he says

John was seated at the desk in his office when the captain opened the
door He bowed gravely

Take off your hat and coat Captain he said Sit down Im glad you
got my message and came early I am expecting the other party at any
moment

Captain Obed was puzzled

The other party he repeated What other party

Myerwell well call him my client He is on his way here and I may
need youas a witness

Witness What to

You will see Now Captain if youll excuse me I have some papers
to arrange Make yourself as comfortable as you can Im sure you wont
have to wait long

Fifteen minutes later the rasping arrogant honk of a motor horn came
from the road outside Heavy important steps sounded upon the office
platform The door opened and in came Mr E Holliday Kendnick

Captain Obed had known of the great mans expected arrival but he
had not expected it so early in the day E Holliday wore a luxurious
furlined coat and looked as prosperous and important as ever but
alsoso it seemed to the captainhe looked disturbed and puzzled and
angry

The captain rose to his feet and said Good morning but except for
a nod of recognition his greeting was unanswered Mr Kendrick slammed
the door behind him stalked across the office took a letter from his
pocket and threw it down upon his attorneys desk

Whats the meaning of that he demanded

John was perfectly calm Sit down Mr Kendrick he said

No I wont sit down What the devil do you mean by sending me that
thing You expected me didnt you You got my wire saying I was
coming

Yes I got it Sit down I have a good deal to say and it may take some
time Throw off your coat

E Holliday threw the fur coat open but he did not remove it He jerked
a chair forward and seated himself upon it

Now what does that thing mean he demanded pointing to the envelope
he had tossed on the desk

John picked up the envelope and opened it A letter and a bank check
fell out

I will explain he said quietly Mr Kendrick you know Captain Obed
Bangs I think Oh it is all right The captain is here at my request
I asked him to be here I wanted a reliable witness and he is reliable
This he went on taking up the letter is a note I wrote you Mr
Kendrick It states that I am resigning my position as your attorney
And this picking up the other paper is my check for five hundred
dollars the amount of your retainer which I am returning to you   
You understand this so far Captain

E Holliday did not wait to hear whether the captain understood or not
His big face flamed red

But what the devil he demanded

John held up his hand

One moment please he said Captain Bangs I want to explain a few
things As you know I have been acting as Mr Kendricks attorney in
the matter of the property occupied by Mrs Barnes He wished me to find
a means of forcing her to sell that property to him Now when a person
owning property does not wish to sell that person cannot be forced into
giving up the property unless it is discovered that the property doesnt
belong to that particular person Thats plain isnt it

He was speaking to Captain Obed and the captain answered

But it does belong to her he declared Her Uncle Abner Barnes willed
it to her Course it belongs to her

I know But sometimes there are such things as flaws in a title That
is to say somewhere and at some time there has been a transfer of that
property that was illegal In such a case the property belongs to the
previous holder no matter in how many instances it has changed hands
since In the present case it was perfectly plain that Mrs Barnes
thought she owned that land having inherited it from her uncle
Therefore she could not be forced to sell unless it was discovered that
there was a flaw in the titlethat she did not own it legally at all I
told my clientMr Kendrick herethat and he ordered me to have the
title searched or to search it myself I have spent a good deal of
time at the recorders office in Ostable doing that very thing And I
discovered that there was such a flaw that Mrs Barnes did not legally
own that land upon which her house stands And as the land was not
hers the house was not hers either

Holliday Kendrick struck the desk a thump with his fist

Good he cried Good enough I told em I generally got what I
wanted Now Ill get it this time Kendrick

Wait said John Captain Obed you understand me so far

The captains outraged feelings burst forth

I understand its durn mean business he shouted Im ashamed of you
John Kendrick

All right all right The shame can wait And I want YOU to wait
toountil Ive finished There was a flaw in that title as I said
Captain Bangs as you know the house in which Mrs Barnes is now living
originally stood not where it now stands but upon land two or three
hundred yards to the north upon a portion of the property which
afterward became the Colfax estate and which now belongs to Mr Kendrick
here You know that

Captain Obed nodded Course I know it he said Capn Abner could
have bought the house and the land it stood on but he didnt want to
He liked the view better from where it stands now So he bought the
strip nigher this way and moved the old house over But he DID buy it
and he paid cash for it I know he did because

All right I know he bought it and all the particulars of the purchase
perhaps better than you do A good deal of my time of late has been
given to investigating the history of that second strip of land
Captain Abner Barnes Mrs Barnes uncle bought the land upon which
he contemplated moving and later did move the house of Isaiah Holt
Darius Holts father then living Mr Holt bought of a man named David
Snow who in turn bought of

Holliday Kendrick interrupted Snow bought of me he growled Worse
luck I was a fool to sell or so I think now but it was years ago I
had no idea at that time of coming here to live and shore land was of
no value then anyhow The strip came to me as a part of my fathers
estate I thought myself lucky to get anything for it But whats all
this ancient history got to do with it now And what do you mean by
sending me this letter and that check

Ill explain I am trying to explain The peculiar point comes in just
here You Mr Kendrick never owned that land

E Holliday bounced in his chair

Didnt own it he roared What nonsense are you talking The land
belonged to my father Samuel Kendrick and I inherited it from him

No you didnt

I tell you I did He left everything he had to me

Yes so he did But he didnt own that land He owned it at one time
probably he owned it when he made his will but he didnt own it at the
time of his death Your father Mr Kendrick was in financial straits
at various times during his residence here in Orham and he borrowed a
good deal of money The most of these were loans pure and simple but
one at least wasnt At one timeneeding money badly I presumehe
sold this strip of land The purchaser thought it was worth nothing
no doubt and never mentioned owning itat least until just before
he died He simply had the deed recorded and forgot it Everyone
else forgot it too But the heirs or the heir of that purchaser I
discovered was the legal owner of that land

Captain Obed uttered an exclamation

Why John Kendrick he shouted Do you mean

Hush Captain Mr Kendrick addressing the redfaced and furious
gentleman at his left have I made myself clear so far Do you follow
me

Follow you I dont believe it IIdont believe it Who was he Who
did my father sell that land to

He sold it to his brother Bailey Kendrick and Bailey Kendrick was my
father Under my fathers will what little property he had came to me
If anything is sure in this world it is that that land occupied by Mrs
Barnes belonged legally to me

Neither of his hearers spoke immediately Then E Holliday sprang to his
feet

It belongs to you does it he shouted It belongs to you All right
so much the better I can buy of you as well as anybody else Thats why
you sent me back your retainer was it So you and I could trade man to
man All right I dont believe it yet but Ill listen to you Whats
your proposition

John shook his head

No he said Youre wrong there I sent you the retainer because I
wished to be absolutely free to do as I pleased with what was mine I
couldnt remain in your employ and act contrary to your interestsor
according to my way of thinking I couldnt As I saw it I did not own
that landmorally at least So having resigned my employment with
you Iwell I gave the land to the person who by all that is right
andand HONEST should own it I had the deed made out in her name and
I sent it to her an hour ago

Captain Obed had guessed it Now HE sprang from his chair

John Kendrick he shouted in huge delight you gave that land to
Thankful Barnes The deed was in that big envelope Winnie S Holt was
takin to her this very mornin

The happenings of the next few minutes were noisy and profane E
Holliday Kendrick was responsible for most of the noise and all of the
profanity He stormed up and down the office calling his cousin every
uncomplimentary name that occurred to him vowing the whole story to
be a lie and that the land should be his anyway threatening suit and
personal vengeance His last words as he strode to the door were

Andand youre the fellow the poor relation that I gave my business
to just from kindness All right I havent finished with you yet

Johns answer was calm but emphatic

Very well he said But this you must understand I consider myself
under no obligation whatever to you Mr Kendrick In the very beginning
of our business relationship you and I had a plain talk I told you when
I consented to act as your attorney that I did so purely as a matter of
business and that philanthropy and kinship were to have no part in it
And when you first mentioned your intention of forcing Mrs Barnes to
give up her home I told you what I thought of that too

East Wellmouths wealthiest summer resident expressed an opinion

Youre a fool he snarled A dd impractical fool

The door slammed behind him John laughed quietly

As a judge of character Captain Bangs he observed my respected
cousin should rank high

Captain Obeds first act after E Hollidays departure was to rush
over seize the young mans hand with one of his own and thump him
enthusiastically upon the back with the other

I said it he crowed I knew it I knew you was all right and square
as a brick all the time John Kendrick NOW let me meet some of those
folks that have been talkin against you You never did a better days
work in your life HES down on you but every decent man in Ostable
Countyll be for you through thick and thin after this Hooray for our
side John shake hands with me again

They shook heartily The captain was so excited and jubilant that he
was incoherent At last however he managed to recover sufficiently to
ask a question

But how did you do it he demanded How did you get on the track of
it You must have had some suspicions

John smiled His friends joy evidently pleased him but he himself
was rather sober and not in the least triumphant

I did have a suspicion Captain he said In fact I had been told
that I had a claim to a piece of land somewhere along the shore here
in East Wellmouth My father told me years ago when he was in his last
sickness He said that he owned a strip of land here but that it was
probably worth little or nothing When I came here I intended looking
into the matter but I did not do so Where the original deed may be I
dont know even now It may be among some of my fathers papers which
are stored in New York But the record of the transfers I found
in Ostable and that is sufficient My claim may not be quite as
impregnable as I gave my late client to understand but it will be hard
to upset I am the only possible claimant and I have transferred
my claim to Mrs Barnes The land belongs to her now she cant be
dispossessed

Butbut John why didnt you say so sooner What made you let
everyone thinkwhat they did think

Before John could reply there came an interruption The door opened and
Thankful Barnes entered She paid no attention to Captain Obed but
walking straight to the desk laid upon it the long envelope which
Winnie S had brought to her house that morning

Will you tell me she asked sharply what that means

John rose Yes he said I will tell you Mrs Barnes It is a rather
long story Sit down please

Thankful sank into the chair he indicated He took up the envelope

I will tell you Mrs Barnes he said why I sent you this deed
Dont go Captain Bangs you know already and I should like to have you
stay Here is the story Mrs Barnes

He told it briefly without superfluous words but so clearly that there
could be no possibility of a misunderstanding When he began Thankfuls
attitude was cold and unbelieving When he finished she was white and
trembling

Mrs Barnes he said in conclusion Im a peculiar fellow Im
afraid I have ratherwell suppose we call them impractical ideas
concerning the ethics of my profession duty to a client and that sort
of thing I have always been particular in taking a case but when
I have taken it I have tried to carry it through Ias you know I
hesitated before accepting my cousins retaining fee and the implied
obligation However I did accept

He might have given his reasons for accepting but he did not He went
on

When this matter of your property came up he said I at first had no
idea that the thing was serious You owned the property as I supposed
and that was sufficient I had told my cousin that and meant to tell
you I meant to tell you a portion of what I have just told the captain
here but Iwell I didnt Mr Daniels remarks irritated me and
Iwell he put the case as a test of legal skill between himself and
me andand I have my share of pride I suppose So I determined to
beat him if I could It was wrong as I see it now and I beg your
pardon

Thankful put a hand to her forehead

But you didbeat him didnt you she stammered You found I didnt
own the land

Yes I found I owned it myself legally If I had found it belonged to
anyone else Iwell I scarcely know what I should have done You see
with a half smile Im trying to be perfectly frank Finding that I was
the owner made it easy

She did not understand It made it easy she repeated slowly But you
gave it to ME

He leaned forward Please dont misunderstand me he said earnestly
As I see it that land belonged to you by all that is right and fair
Legally perhaps it didnt but legal honesty isnt always moral
honesty Ive found that out even in my limited practice

Captain Obed tried to put in a word Dont you see Thankful he said
John knew you thought you owned the land and so

Hush Please dont II dont see Mr Kendrick youyou have prided
yourself on bein honest with your clients and Mr Holliday Kendrick
WAS your client

John smiled I compromised there he answered I returned his money
and resigned as his attorney before I sent you the deed It was a
compromise I admit but I had to choose between him andwell my
honor if you like although that sounds theatrical I chose to be
honest with myselfthats all The land is yours Mrs Barnes

He handed her the envelope containing the deed She took it and sat
there turning it over and over in her fingers not looking at it but
thinking or trying to think

You give it to me she said It was yours and you give it to me Why
should you Dodo you think I can TAKE it from you

Certainly you must take it

But I cant I cant

Certainly you can Why not

Why NOT After the things Ive thought about you And after the way
Ive treated you Andand after Emily

She didnt know either broke in Captain Obed She didnt understand
She

Thats enough Captain interrupted John Mrs Barnes you
mustnt misunderstand me again Neither you nornor Miss Howes must
misunderstand my motives I give this to you because I honestly believe
it belongs to you not because I expect anything in return II confess
I did hesitate a little I fearedI feared she

He means Emily broke in the irrepressible captain You mean Emily
dont you John

Yes with some embarrassment Yes I do mean Miss Howes She and I
had beenfriends and I feared she might misinterpret my reasons
It was not until yesterday afternoon when I learned of theof the
engagement that I felt certain neither you nor she could misunderstand
Then I felt perfectly free to send you the deed

Captain Obed who had grasped his meaning would have spoken but
Thankful spoke first She evidently was quite at sea

The engagement she repeated What engagement

Miss Howes engagement to Mr Daniels They were congratulating him
on his engagement yesterday at the station I overheard the
congratulations I had not known of it before

At last Thankful understood She looked at the speaker then at Captain
Obed and the color rushed to her face

And even though EmilyHush Obed Bangs you keep stilland even
though you knew Emily was engaged to Heman Daniels you could still give
me and herthis

Now Mrs Barnes do you think

Think John Kendrick I think I ought to get down on my knees and
beg your pardon for what Ive thought these last two months But Im
thinkin right now and you aint Heman Daniels aint engaged to Emily
Howes at all hes engaged to that Bayport woman the one hes been so
attentive to for a year or more Oh its true Winnie S told me so
just now The news had just come to town and he was full of it Hemans
over to Bayport spendin Christmas with her this very minute

Even Captain Obed had not a word to say He was looking at John Kendrick
and Johns face was white

And Ill tell you somethin else went on Thankful somethin that
Emily herself told me last night She might have been engaged to Heman
Daniels he asked her to be But she wouldnt have him she told him
no

John stepped from behind the desk Sheshe told him no he repeated
She    Why

Thankful laughed aloud That she cried I SHANT tell you If you
dont know yourself then I aint the one to tell you

Obed was at her side Thats enough he ordered taking her by the
arm Thats enough Thankful Barnes You come right along with me and
fetch that deed with you This young feller here has got some thinkin
to do I callate His mind needs overhaulin You come with me


He led her out to the sidewalk and on until they reached the postoffice
Then still grasping her arm he led her into that building The office
was open for a few hours even though the day was Christmas

Here he whispered eagerly Stand here by the window where we can
see whether he comes out or not

But Obed what are you doin

Doin Im waitin to see whether that boy is a permanent fool or just
a temporary one Wait now wait and watch

The wait was but momentary The door of John Kendricks office opened
and John himself came out He shut the door but he did not wait to lock
it They saw him cross the road and stride off down the lane toward the
shore

Captain Obed laughed aloud

No he cried exultantly twas only temporary Hes got his senses
now Thankful lets you and me go for a walk We shant be needed at
the High Cliff House for a spelland we wont be WANTED there either




CHAPTER XVIII


The walk was a long one It took them a good way from the more populous
section of East Wellmouth over the hills and at last along the beach
at the foot of the bluff It was an odd season of the year for a stroll
by the seaside but neither Thankful nor the captain cared for that In
fact it is doubtful if either could have told afterward just where
they had been There were so many and such wonderful things to tell to
speculate upon and to discuss

Thankful told of her brothers return of Mr Cobbs miraculous
generosity and for the first time of the ghostly haunting of the
little back bedroom In the latter story Captain Obed seemed to find
much amusement He was skeptical

Ive heard of a good many ghosts in my time he said but I never
heard of one that could stand daylight or commonsense The idea of your
bein troubled all this time by that snorin business or whatever tis
Why didnt you tell me about it Id have had that spook out of that
bedroom afore this I bet you

It seemed so silly confessed Thankful that I was ashamed to tell
anybody But theres SOMETHIN there I heard it the first night I came
and Rebecca Timpson heard it later on and then Emily and I and Solomon
heard it all together

Yes Well then lets see WHEN you heard it Every time twas when
there was a storm rain and wind and the like of that eh

Yes Ive slept in that room myself a good many times but never when
there was a gale of wind or rain Thats so twas always in a storm
that it came

Umhum And it always snored Ho ho that IS funny A ghost with a
snore Must have a cold in its head I callate

You wouldnt laugh if youd heard it last night And it didnt snore
the first time It said Oh Lord then

Humph so you said Well that does complicate things I will give in
The wind in a waterpipe might snore but it couldnt say Oh Lord
not very plain You heard that the first night afore Kenelm and I got
there

Yes And there wasnt another person in that house except Emily and me
I know that

I wonder if you do know it    Well Ill have a whack at that room
myself and if a spook starts snorin when Im there IllIll put a
clothespin on its nose after Ive thanked it for scarin old Sol into
repentance and decency It took a spirit to do that No livin human
could have worked THAT miracle

I agree with you Well now I know why he acted the way he did whenever
Uncle Abners name was mentioned I have a feelinat least I imagine
there may have been somethin else somethin we dont know and never
will know between Solomon and my uncle There may be some paper some
agreement hid around somewheres that is legally bindin on the old
sinner I cant hardly believe just breakin a promise would make him
give anybody fifteen hundred dollars

Maybe but I dont know hes always been superstitious and a great
feller for Spiritulist campmeetins and so on And he was always
regular at prayermeetin Sometimes that sort of a swab knowin how
mean he actually is tries to square his meanness with the Almighty by
bein prominent in the church There may be the kind of paper you say
but I shouldnt wonder if twas just scare and a bad conscience

Well Im grateful to him anyhow And as for Johns kindness II
dont know what to say Last night I thought this might be the blackest
Christmas ever I had but now it looks as if it might be one of the
brightest And its all so strange so strange it should have come on
Christmas It seems as if the Lord had planned it so

Maybe He did But it aint so strange when you come to think of
it Your brother came home on Christmas Eve because he thoughtor I
shouldnt wonder if he didthat youd be more likely to forgive him
and take him in then Solomon came over when he did on account of his
hearin that Holliday Kendrick was comin All days Christmas or any
other are alike to Sol when theres a dollar to be sighted with a
spyglass And as for Johns givin you the deed today I presume likely
that was a sort of Christmas present probably he meant to give it to
you for that So the Christmas part aint so wonderful after all

Yes it is Its all wonderful I ought to be a very very happy woman
If John and Emily only come together again I shall be sure and sartin
Of course though she added with emphasis I shant let him give me
that land Ill make some arrangement to pay him for it a little at a
time if no other way

The captain opened his mouth to protest but there was an air of
finality in Thankfuls tone which caused him to defer the protest until
another time

Wellwell all right he said That can be talked about later
on But how about yourself I suppose youll keep right on with the
boardinhouse now

Of course

Itll be pretty hard work for you alone wont it Especially if Emily
and John should take a notion to get married

Oh well Im used to bein alone I shant mindmuch Why here we
are right at the foot of our path Ive been talkin so fast I didnt
realize wed got here already Do you suppose its safe to go up to the
house now Obed

I guess so We can go in the kitchen way and Ill make noise enough
to warn all hands that were comin Whos that by the back door John
aint it No it aint its Kenelm

Kenelm and Imogene were standing at the kitchen door When the
captain and Mrs Barnes drew near they saw that they were in danger of
interrupting what seemed to be a serious conversation Neither of the
parties to that conversation noticed them until they were close at hand
Imogene had a slip of paper in her hand

Captain Obed whose mind was occupied with but one thought just then
asked a question

Imogene he asked in a loud whisper wheres Miss Emily

Imogene started and turned Kenelm also started He looked embarrassed

Eh cried Imogene Oh its you Mrs Thankful I was wonderin
where you was Ive been havin a little talk with Kenelm here Its all
right Mrs Thankful

Whats all right asked Thankful

About your brother workin here in Kenelms place He dont mind You
dont do you Kenelm

Mr Parker who had been standing upon one foot and pawing like a
restless horse with the other shifted his position

Noo he drawled II dont knows I do

Thankful was disturbed Im sorry you said anything yet awhile
Imogene she said My plans about Jedediah are hardly made yet I do
hate to make you lose your place Kenelm If I could see my way clear to
keepin two men Id do it but I declare I cant see it

Thats all right maam said Kenelm I aint particlar

He dont mind a bit Mrs Thankful put in Imogene Honest he dont
He dont have to work unless hes obliged tonot much anyhow Kenelms
got money you know

I know at least Ive heard he had some money But taint because he
needs the money that I feel bad its because of his engagement to you
Imogene I suppose youre plannin to be married some time or other
and

Oh thats all right too interrupted Imogene eagerly You neednt
worry about our engagement She neednt worry about that need she
Kenelm

No said Kenelm shortly

Captain Obed thought it time to repeat his first question

Wheres Miss Emily he asked

Shes in the livinroom

Isis anybody with her

Imogene nodded Umhum she said gleefully hes there too

Who The captain and Thankful spoke in concert

Mr John Kendrick I let him in and I didnt tell her who it was at
all She didnt know till she went in herself and found him Then I
came right out and shut the door Oh with another nod Ive got some
sense even if I did come from the Orphans Home

Captain Obed and Thankful looked at each other

Then he did come here exclaimed Thankful

Course he did I told you he want quite a fool Been there some time
has he

Yes Shall I tell em youve come Ill knock first

No no Thankfuls reply was emphatic Wheres the rest of the
folks she asked

Georgie and Mr Cahoonyour brother I meanhave gone up to the
village with the other one the Cobb man

What have they gone to the village for

To help Mr Cobb get his horse and team at Chris Badgers Hes gone
you know

Whos gone

Why the Cobb one Hes gone home again I tried to get him to stay for
dinner so did Miss Emily We knew youd want him to But he wouldnt
stay Said he was goin home Seemed to me he wanted to get out of the
house quick as ever he could He gave Georgie a dollar for Christmas

WHAT Captain Obed leaned against the corner of the house A dollar
he groaned Sol Cobb gave somebody a dollar for Christmas Dont pinch
me anybody I dont want to wake up Let me enjoy my dream long as I
can Thankful did you say Sol looked sick

I said he looked pretty nearly sick when he came down this mornin

I believe it It must have been a mighty serious attack Did Georgie
take the dollar with him

No He left it with Miss Emily

Thats a mercy The outdoor air may make Sol feel more rational and
soons he came to his senses hed want that dollar back Tut tut tut
Dont talk to ME I shall believe in ghosts pretty soon

Thankful looked troubled and annoyed

Im awful sorry he went she said The poor old thing He was so
miserable I did pity him I must drive over and see him tomorrow sure
But what makes me feel the worst she added is to think of Jedediahs
cruisin up to the village dressed in the rags he was wearin He looked
likelike somethin the cat brought in And everybodyll want to know
who he is and when they find hes my brother And on Christmas Day
too

Imogene it was Emilys voice Imogene where are you

Captain Obed roared a greeting

Merry Christmas all hands he shouted Hey you John Kendrick are
you there

There was no answer Thankful did not wait for one she rushed into the
house John Kendrick was alone in the livingroom when she reached it
Emily had fled Thankful looked at Mr Kendrick and the look gave her
the information she wanted

Oh Mr KendrickJohn she cried I shall call you John now I can
cant Iwhere is she

John smiled He looked ready to smile at all creation I think she is
upstairs he said At least she ran in that direction when she heard
the captain call

Thankful started for the hall and the stairs At the door she turned

Dont you go away John she ordered Dont you dare go away from
this house Youre goin to have dinner here THIS day if you never do
again

John apparently had no intention of going away He smiled once
more and walked toward the diningroom Captain Obed met him at the
threshold

Well shouted the captain Well What have you got to say for
yourself now eh

John laughed Not much Captain he answered not much except that
Ive been an idiot

Yup All right But that aint what I want to know I want to know
he stopped and gazed keenly at his friends face I dont knows I do
want to know either he added I callate I know it already When a
young feller stands around looking as sheepish as if hed been caught
stealin hens eggs and grinnin at the same time as if he was proud of
it thenthen theres just one thing happened to him I callate youve
found out why she wouldnt marry Heman Daniels eh My but Im glad
You dont deserve it but Im glad just the same Lets shake hands
again

They were still shaking and the captain was crowing like a triumphant
rooster over his friends good fortune and the humiliation in store for
the tattletales and characternaggers among his fellowtownsmen when
Imogene appeared

Is Mrs Thankful here she asked Well never mind Youll do
Capn Bangs Will you and Mr Kendrick come out here to the back door a
minute Id like to have you witness somethin

Captain Obeds forehead wrinkled in surprise

Witness somethin he repeated Then with a glance at John who was
as puzzled as he Humph I witnessed somethin this mornin and now Im
to witness somethin else Ill begin to be an expert pretty soon wont
I Humph Whatwell heave ahead Imogene Ill come

Imogene conducted them to the kitchen door where Mr Parker still
stood looking remarkably foolish Imogenes manner however was very
businesslike

Now then she said addressing the two witnesses you see this
piece of paper Perhaps youd better read it first

She handed the paper to Captain Obed who looked at it and passed it
over to John It was the statement signed by Kenelm in which he agreed
to marry Imogene whenever she asked him to do so

You see what tis dont you asked Imogene Yes Well now you watch
and see what I do with it

She tore the agreement into small pieces Stepping into the kitchen she
put the pieces in the stove

There she exclaimed returning to the door That ends that He and
I pointing to Kenelm aint engaged any longer and he dont have to
work here any longer Is it all plain to both of you

It was not altogether plain even yet The expression on the faces of the
witnesses proved that

Now Kenelm said Imogene cheerfully you can leave if you want to
And with a mischievous chuckle when you get there you can give your
sister my love the inmates love you know Lordy Wont she enjoy
gettin it

When Kenelm had gone which he did immediately and without a word
Imogene vouchsafed an explanation

I never did want to marry him she said When I get ready to marry
anybody itll be somebody with more getupandgit than hes got I
hope But I was ready to do anything to help Mrs Thankful from frettin
and when he talked about quittin his job right in the busy season I had
to keep him here somehow I just HAD to He was kind ofof mushy and
soft about me first alongI guess guys of his kind are likely to be
about any woman thatll listen to emand when his sister got jealous
and put him up to leavin I thought up my plan I got him to ask
mehed as much as asked me aforeand then I made him sign that paper
Ugh the silliness I had to go through afore he would sign it Dont ask
me about it or I shant eat any dinner But he did sign it and I knew I
had him under my thumb Hes scared of that sister of his but hes more
scared of losin his money And shes just as scared of that as he is
THEY didnt want any breachin of promisesNo siree Ho ho

She stopped to laugh in gleeful triumph John laughed too Captain Obed
scratched his head

But hold on there heave to Imogene he ordered I dont seem to
get the whole of this yet You did agree to marry him Suppose hed said
youd got to marry him what then

He wouldnt He didnt want to marry menot after Id took my time at
bossin him around a while And if he hadwell if he had and Id had
to do it I would I suppose Id do anything for Mrs Thankful
after whats shes done for me Miss Emily and me had a talk about
selfsacrifice and I see my duty plain I told Miss Emily why I did
it that night when you all came home from the Fair She understood the
whole thing

The captain burst into a roar of laughter

Ho ho he shouted Well Imogene I said you beat all my goin to
sea and you doyou sartin do Now Id like to be on hand and see how
Hannah takes it If I know her now that that engagement aint hangin
over her shell even up with her brother for all shes had to put up
with Ho ho Poor old Kenelms in for a warm Christmas

And yet Kenelms Christmas was not so warm after all He told Hannah
of his broken engagement wasting no wordswhich for him was very
remarkableand expressing no regret whatever Hannah listened at first
with joy and then when Imogenes love was conveyed to her with
growing anger

The idea she cried And you bring me over a message like that From
herfrom an Orphans Home inmate to your own sister And you let her
walk over you chuck you out as if you was a wornout doormat shed wiped
her boots on and never said a word Well Ill say it for you Ill
tell her what I think of her And she was callatin to sue YOU for
breaches of promise was she Humph Two can play at that game I dont
knows I shant have you sue her

I dont want to I told you this mornin I didnt care nothin about
marryin her And you didnt want me to yourself Now that its all over
you ought to be happy I should think I dont see what youre growlin
about

No I suppose you dont Youyou with withering contempt you
havent got the selfrespect ofof a woodtick ImI declare Im
perfectly prospected with shame at havin such a brother in my family
And after cruisin around with her and takin her to the Cattle Show

You went to the Cattle Show yourself

I dont care if I did Now you march yourself upstairs and change your
clothes

Aw now Hannah These clothes are good enough

Good enough For Christmas Day I should think youd be ashamed Oh
you make me so provoked If folks knew what I know about you

Kenelm interrupted a most unusual thing for him

Sposin they knew what I know about you he observed

What What do you mean by that What have I done to be ashamed of

I dont know I dont know what you did I dont even know where you
went But when a person crawls down a ladder in the middle of the night
and goes off somewhere withwith somebody else and dont get home until
most mornin thenwell then I callate folks might be interested if
they knew thats all

Hannahs face was a picture a picture to be studied For the first time
in her life she was at a loss for words

I aint askin no questions went on Kenelm calmly I aint told
nobody and I shant unlessunless somebody keeps naggin and makes me
mad But I shant change my clothes this day and I shant do nothin
else unless I feel like it either

His sister stared at him blankly for a moment Then she fled from the
room Kenelm took his pipe from his pocket filled and lighted it and
smoked smiling between puffs at the ceiling The future looked serene
and rosyto Kenelm


Christmas dinner at the High Cliff House was a joyful affair
notwithstanding that the promise of fair weather had come to naught and
it was raining once more John stayed for that dinner so did Captain
Obed The former and Miss Emily said very little and their appetites
were not robust but they appeared to be very happy indeed Georgie
certainly was happy and Jedediahs appetite was all that might have been
expected of an appetite fed upon the cheapest of cheap food for days and
compelled to go without any food for others Thankful was happy too or
pretended to be and Captain Obed laughed and joked with everyone Yet
he seemed to have something on his mind and his happiness was not as
complete as it might have been

Everyone helped Imogene wash the dishes then John and Emily left the
kitchen bound upon some mysterious errand Captain Obed and Georgie
donned what the captain called dirty weather rigs and went out to
give George Washington and Patrick Henry and the poultry their Christmas
dinner

The storm had flooded the low land behind the barn The hen yard was in
the center of a miniature island The walls of the pigsty which Thankful
had had built rose from a lake

Its a mercy Pat moved to drier quarters eh second mate chuckled
the captain Hed have had to sleep with a lifepreserver on if he
stayed here

They fed the hens and gave George Washington a liberal measure of oats
and a big forkful of hay

Dont want him to go hungry Christmas Day said Captain Obed Now
lets cruise around and see if Patrick Henry is singin out for liberty
or death

The pig was not apparently singing out for anything When they
reached the wall of the pen by the washshed he was not in sight
But they heard him somewhere back in the darkness beneath the shed
breathing stertorously apparently sound asleep

Georgie laughed Hear him he said Hes so fat he always makes that
noise when hes asleep And hes awful smart When its warm and nice
weather he sleeps out here in the sun When it rains and is cold same
as now he always goes way back in there Hear him Dont he make a
funny noise

Emily came hurrying around the corner of the house

Captain Bangs she whispered Captain Bangs

The captain looked at her He was about to ask why she whispered instead
of speaking aloud but the expression on her face caused him to change
his question to Whats the matter

Emily looked at Georgie before replying

II want to see you she answered I want you to come with me Come
quick Georgie you must stay in the kitchen with Imogene

Georgie did not want to stay in the kitchen but when he found Jedediah
there he was more complacent The exgold seeker and his tales of
adventure had a tremendous fascination for Georgie

Emily led the way toward the front stairs and Captain Obed followed

Whats up he whispered Whats all the mystery about

We dont knowyet But we want you to help us find out John and I
have been up to look at the haunted room andand ITS THERE

There What

Thethe ghost or whatever it is We heard it Come

At the door of the rooms which were the scene of Mr Cobbs recent
supernatural experience and of Miss Timpsons warning they found
Thankful and John standing listening Thankful looked rather
frightened John was eager and interested

You found him Emily he whispered Good Captain you and I are
commissioned to lay the ghost And the ghost is in Listen

They listened Above the patter and rattle of the rain on the roof
they heard a sound the sound which two or three members had heard the
previous night the sound of snoring

I should have gone in before whispered John but they wanted me to
wait for you Come on Captain

They opened the door of the larger room and entered on tiptoe The
snoring was plainly heard now and it seemed as they expected to come
from the little room adjoining Into that room the party proceeded the
men in the lead There was no one there save themselves and nothing out
of the ordinary to be seen But the snoring kept on plainer than ever

John looked behind the furniture and under the bed

Its no use doin that whispered Thankful Ive done that myself
fifty times

Captain Obed was walking about the room his ear close to the wall
listening At a point in the center of the rear wall that at the back
of the house he stopped and listened more intently than ever

John he whispered eagerly come here

John came

Listen whispered the captain Its plainer here than anywhere else
aint it

Yes Yes I think it is But where does it come from

Somewhere overhead seems to me Give me that chair

Cautiously and silently he placed the chair close to the wall stood
upon it and with his ear against the wallpaper moved his head
backward and forward and up and down Then he stopped moving and
reaching up felt along the wall with his hands

Ive got it he whispered Heres the place

His fingers described a circle on the wall He tapped gently in the
middle of the circle

Hark he said All solid out here but herehollow as a drum
Itsits a stovepipe hole thats what tis There was a stove here
one time or nother and the pipe hole was papered over

Butbut what of it whispered Thankful I dont care about stovepipe
holes Its that dreadful noise I want to locate I hear it now just as
plain as ever

Where could a stovepipe go to from here mused the captain Not into
the kitchen the kitchen chimneys way over tother side Maybe there
was a chimney here afore the house was moved

But the snoring faltered Emily Dont you hear it

Captain Obed put his ear against the covered stovepipe hole He listened
and as he listened his face took on a new expression an expression of
sudden suspicion then of growing certainty and a moment later of
huge amusement

He stepped down from the chair

Stay right where you are he ordered Dont move and dont make any
noise Ill be right back

He hurried out They waited The snoring kept on and on Suddenly it
ceased Then in that very room or so it seemed sounded a grunt and a
frightened squeal And then a voice a hollow voice which cried

Ahoy all hands Im the ghost of Nebuchadnezzars first wife and I
want to know what you folks mean by wakin me up

The three in the back bedroom looked at each other

Its Captain Bangs cried Emily

Its Obed exclaimed Thankful

Hes found it shouted Kendrick Come on

The captain was not in the kitchen when they got there He had gone out
of doors so Imogene said Unmindful of the rain they rushed out and
around the corner behind and below the washshed Patrick Henry was
running about his pen apparently much disturbed but Captain Obed was
not in sight

Where is he demanded Thankful Wheres he gone to

Hello there John cried a voice from the darkness at the rear of the
pigsty under the kitchen Come in here Never mind your clothes Come
in

John vaulted over the rail of the pen and disappeared A few moments
later he came out again in company with the captain Both were laughing
heartily

Weve got the answer puffed Captain Obed who was out of breath
Weve laid the ghost You remember I told you that day when we first
explored this place that old Laban Eldredge had this pigpen built Afore
that twas all potato cellar and at one time afore the house was made
over there must have been a stove in that back bedroom Theres no
chimney but theres cracks between the boards at the back of that
pigpen and any noise down here goes straight up between the walls and
out of that stovepipe hole like a speakin tube You heard me when I
spoke to you just now didnt you

Yesyes answered Emily We heard you butbut what was it that
snored What was the ghost

Captain Obed burst into a shout of laughter There he is he said
pointing

Thankful and Emily looked

What cried the latter

The PIG exclaimed Thankful

Thats what Georgie gave me a hint when he and I was out here just
now Old Pat was asleep way in back there and snorin like a steam
engine And Georgie said he never slept there unless twas a storm
rainin same as tis now And every time you heard theho hothe
ghost twas on a stormy night It stormed the night you got here and
when Becky Timpson had her warnin and last night when Sol Cobb got
his Ho ho ho Patrick Henrys the ghost Well hes a healthy old
spirit

Emily laughed until the tears came into her eyes

The pig she cried Oh Aunt Thankful You and I were frightened
almost to death last nightand of that creature there Oh dear me

Thankful laughed too but she was not fully convinced

Maybe twas the pig that snored she admitted And of course whatever
we heard came up that pipe hole But there was no pig there on that
first night I didnt buy the pig until long afterwards And besides
what I heard THAT night talked it said Oh Lord Patrick Henry may
be a smart pig but he cant talk

This was something of a staggerer but the captain was still certain he
was on the right track

Then somethin else was there he declared Somebody was down under
the house here thats sartin Who could it have been Never mind Ill
find out Well clear up the whole of this ghost business now weve got
started Maybe we can find some hint in there now John go up and fetch
a lantern theres a good fellow and well have a look

John brought the lantern and by its light the two men explored the
recesses of Patrick Henrys bed chamber When they emerged covered with
dust and cobwebs the captain held something in his hand

I dont know what tis he said Maybe nothin of any account but
twas trod down in the corner close to the wall Humph Eh Why its a
mitten aint it

It was a mitten a much worn one and on the inside of the wristhand
were worked three letters

K I P read Captain Obed Whats K I P stand for

Imogene who had joined the group clapped her hands

I know she cried Kenelm Issachar Parker

Thankful nodded Thats it she agreed Andandwhy now I come to
think of it I remember hearin Hannah pitchin into Kenelm that first
mornin after our night at her house for losin his umbrella and a
mitten

Right you are Captain Obed slapped his knee And Kenelm was out
somewheres that night afore he and I came over here He found his
umbrella and he brought it home whole a week or so later But it want
whole all that time because Seth Ellis told me Kenelm brought an
umbrella in for him to fix All turned inside out it was Eh Yes sir
Were gettin nigher port all the time Kenelm came by this house that
night because twas him that saw your light in the window Ill bet you
he smashed his new umbrella on the way down from the club and crawled
in here out of the wet to fix it He couldnt fix it so he left it
here and came back after it the next day And twas then he dropped this
mitten

Emily offered a suggestion

You said you saw someone hiding behind the henhouse that next morning
Captain she said

So I did And I thought twas one of Solon Taylors boys Ill bet
twas Kenelm hed sneaked over to get the umbrella It was him that
said Oh Lord that night Ill bet high on it When he thought of
what Hannahd say to his smashin the umbrella she gave him its a
wonder he didnt say more than that Thats the answerthe whole
answerand Ill prove it next time I see Kenelm

Which by the way he did

Later in the afternoon John and Emily walked up to the village together
They asked Thankful and Captain Obed to accompany them but the
invitation was declined However as John had suddenly remembered that
he had left his office door unlocked he felt that he should go and
Emily went with him

I presume likely observed the captain as he looked after them that
I ought to feel consciencestruck for not sayin yes when they asked
me to come along but somehow I dont I have a sneakin feelin that
theyll get on firstrate without our company Thankful

Thankful was silent She was sitting by the window The pair were alone
together in the livingroom now Imogene and Jedediah and Georgie were
in the kitchen making molasses candy

Well observed Captain Obed thats so aint it Dont you agree
with me

Still there was no answer and turning the captain was surprised to see
his companion wiping her eyes with her handkerchief

For thunder sakes he exclaimed in dismay Whats happened now Are
you cryin

Thankful tried to smile No she said Im not cryin At least I
hadnt ought to cry I ought to be awful happy and I am Seein those
two go off together that way made me think that pretty soon theyd be
goin away for good And II was a little lonesome I guess

Sho sho You mustnt be lonesome They wont get married yet awhile I
callate

No I suppose not But Emily will have to go next week back to her
school and shell take Georgie with her Ill miss em both terribly

Yes so you will But youve got your brother now Hell be some
company

Yes But unless hes changed more than Im afraid he has hell be
more responsibility than comfort He means well enough poor Jed but he
aint what youd call a capable person

Well Imogenes capable enough and shell be here

Yes

Silence for a time Then Captain Obed spoke

Thankful he said earnestly I know whats worryin you Its just
what you said the responsibility of it all Its too much for you the
responsibility of handlin this big house and a houseful of boarders
when they come You hadnt ought to do it alone You ought to have
somebody to help

Perhaps I had but I dont know who twill be I cant afford to hire
the kind of help I need

Why dont you take a partner

A partner Who for goodness sakes

Wellme Ive got some money of my own Ill go in partners with you
here    Oh now now he added hastily Dont think theres any
charity in this There aint at all As I see it this boardin house
is mighty good business and a safe investment Suppose you and I go in
partners on it Thankful

Thankful shook her head

Youre awfully good she said

No I aint

Yes you are But I couldnt do it Obed

Why not

You know why not For the same reason I couldnt say yes to what you
asked me a while ago I cant let you help me out of pity

Pity He turned and stared at her Pity he repeated

Yes pity I know youre sorry for me You said you were And I know
youd do anything to help me eveneven

He interrupted

Thankful Barnes he said did you think I asked you what I asked that
time out of PITY

Now Obed

Stop Answer me Did you think such a fool thing as THAT You stay
right where you are I want you to look me in the face

Dont Obed Dont Let me be Dont

He paid not the slightest attention He was bending over her his hand
beneath her chin forcing her to look at him

Dont Obed she begged

Thankful you tell me Did you think I asked you to marry me just
because I pitied you Just because I was sorry for you Did you

Obed please

Thankful Ive come to care for you moren anything else in the world
I dont pity you Ive been pityin myself for the last month because I
couldnt have youjust you I want you Thankful Barnes and if youll
marry me Ill be the happiest critter that walks

Oh Obed dont make it so hard for me You said you wouldnt Andand
you cant carereally

I cant Do you care for me Thats what I want to know

Obed you and I aint young folks Were gettin on towards old age
What would folks say if

He threw his arms about her and literally lifted her from the chair

I dont care a durn WHAT they say he shouted exultantly Youve
said what I was waitin for Or youve looked it anyhow Now then WHEN
shall we be married Thats the next thing for you to say my girl


They sat there in the gathering dusk and talked The captain was
uproariously gay He could scarcely keep still but whistled and drummed
tunes upon the chair arm with his fingers Thankful was more subdued and
quiet but she was happy completely happy at last

Thisll be some boardinhouse this one of ours declared the
captain Well build the addition you wanted and well make the city
folks sit up and take notice And with a gleeful chuckle we wont
have any ghost snorin warnins either

Thankful laughed No we wont she said And yet Im awfully
grateful to thatthatthat pig ghost If it hadnt been for him that
mortgage would still be hangin over us And Solomon would never have
been scared into doin what he promised Uncle Abner he would do Perhaps
hell be a better man a more generous man to some of his other poor
victims after this I hope he will

So do I but I have my doubts

Well well never kill old Patrick Henry will we That would be TOO
ungrateful

Captain Obed slapped his knee

Kill him he repeated I should say not Why hes your Uncle Abner
and Rebecca Timpsons sister Medora and old Laban Eldredge and I dont
know how many more Killin him would be a double backaction massacre
No indeed we wont kill him Come on lets go out and have a look at
him now Id like to shake his hand if he had one

But Obed its rainin

What of it We dont care for rain Its goin to be all sunshine for
you after this my lady Im the weather prophet and I tell you so God
bless you Thankful Barnes

Thankful smiled

He has blessed me already Obed she said

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms

remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
