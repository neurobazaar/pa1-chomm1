PREFACE

 The candlelight sweeps softly through the room
 Filling dim surfaces with golden laughter
 Touching with mystery each high hung rafter
 Cutting a path of promise through the gloom

 Slim little elves dance gently on each taper
 Wistful small ghosts steal out of shrouded
 corners
 And like a line of vague enchanted mourners
 Great shadows sway like windblown sheets of paper

 Gently as fingers drawn across your hair
 I see the yellow flicker of it creep
 And in a silence that is kin to sleep
 I feel a world away from pain and care

 Roads stretch like arms across the world outside
 Roads reach to strife to happiness to fame
 Here in the candlelight I speak your name
 Here we are at lifes cross way side by side

 OH THERE ARE BROOKS THERE AND FIELDS THERE AND NOOKS
 THERE
 NOOKS WHERE A SEEKER MAY FIND FOREST FLOWERS
 BLUE IS THE SKY THERE AND SOFT WINDS CREEP BY THERE
 SINGING A SONG THROUGH THE LONG SUMMER HOURS




WOOD MAGIC

 The woods lay dreaming in a topaz dream
 And we who silently roamed hand in hand
 Were pilgrims in a strange enchanted land
 Where life was love and love was all agleam

 And old remembered songs came back to greet
 Our ears from other worlds of long ago
 The worlds that we of earth may seldom know
 And to those songs we timed our vagrant feet

 We did not speak we did not need to say
 The thought that lay so buried in our hearts
 The thoughts as sweet as springtime rain that
 starts
 The buds to blossoming in wistful May

 We did not need to speak we could not speak
 The wonder words that we in silence knew
 We walked as very little children do
 Who feel but cannot tell the thing they seek

 Beyond a screen of bushes bending low
 We knew that fair Titania lay at rest
 Her pillowed head upon her lovers breast
 Her kisses swift as birds that come and go

 And underneath a wall of mottled stone
 We knew the sleeping beauty lay in state
 Entangled in a mist of tears to wait
 The prince whose kiss would raise her to a throne

 Perhaps a witch with single flaming eye
 Was watching from beneath the hemlock tree
 And fairies that our gaze might never see
 Laughed at us as we hand in hand crept by

 Laughed at us No I somehow think they knew
 That you and I were kin to them that day
 I think they knew that we were years away
 From everything but makebelieve come true

 I think they knew that singing through the air
 There thrilled a vague insistent harplike call
 And that where woodbine blazed against the wall
 You held me close and kissed my windtossed hair




WATERIN TH HORSES

 I took th horses to th brookto water em you know
 Th air was cold with just a touch o frost
 And as we went ajoggin down I couldnt help but
 think
 O city folk an all the things they lost

 O cause they have their lighted streetstheir Great
 White Way an such
 O course they have their buildings large an tall
 But my they never know th joy o ridin ter th
 brook
 An somehow I dont envy em at all

 Perhaps Id like itfor awhileto hear th songs an
 laughter
 But somehow I dont know exactly why
 Id feel th country callin me Id long again fer
 silence
 An fer Gods mountains blue against the sky

 I took th horses to th brookto water em you know
 Th day was pretty as a day can be
 An as we went ajoggin down I couldnt help but
 think
 O city folk an all they never see




AT DAWN

 I THE CAVEMAN

 I live And the scarlet sunrise is climbing the
 mountain steep
 I live And below in the caverns the rest
 of my clansmen sleep
 But II am here and chanting I could slay a
 beast with my hand
 And I thrill as the mist of the morning creeps up
 from the rockstrewn land

 I live I have strength for fightingand courage to
 rend and slay
 I live And my eyes are lifting to gaze at the new
 born day
 And I pause on the way to my hewnout cave
 though I know that she waits me there
 My mate with her eyes on the scarlet dawn and the
 wind in her flamelike hair

 I liveand the joy of living leaps up in my searching
 eyes
 I live and my soul starts forward to challenge the
 waking skies
 Far down are the torrents roaring far up are the
 clouds unfurled
 And I stand on the cliff exultant akin to the waking
 world

 The mists are gone and an eagle sweeps down from
 the mountain high
 And I wish that my arms were feathered and strong
 that I too might fly
 I live I am one with the morning Ah I am a
 MAN and free
 And I shout aloud and the scarlet dawn shouts back
 on the gale to me




II THE PIONEER

 I creep along but silently
 For oh the dawn is coming
 I creep along for I have heard
 A flinttipped arrow humming
 And I have heard a snapping twig
 Above the winds low laughter
 And I have knownand thrilled to know
 That swift THEY followed after

 The forest turns from black to grey
 The leaves are silvershining
 But I have heard a faroff call
 The warwhoops sullen whining
 And I have been a naked form
 Among the tree trunks prowling
 And I have glimpsed a savage face
 That faded from me scowling

 A rosy color sweeps the sky
 A vagrant lark is singing
 But as I steal along the trail
 I know that day is bringing
 A host of redskins in its train
 Their tommyhawks are gleaming
 I SEE THEM NOW or can it be
 The first pale sunlight beaming

 I creep along but stealthily
 For oh the dawn is coming
 I creep alongbut I have heard
 A flinttipped arrow humming
 And yet my heart is light inside
 My soul itself is flying
 To greet the dawn I AM ALIVE
 AND WHAT IS DEATHBUT DYING




III THE FARMER

 The dawn is here I climb the hill
 The earth is young and strangely still
 A tender green is showing where
 But yesterday my fields were bare
 I climb and as I climb I sing
 The dawn is here and with itspring

 My oxen stamp the ground and they
 Seem glad with me that soon the day
 Will bring new work for us to do
 The light above is clear and blue
 And one great cloud that swirls on high
 Seems sent from earth to kiss the sky

 The birds are coming back again
 They know that soon the golden grain
 Will wave above this fragrant loam
 The birds with singing hasten home
 And I who watch them feel their song
 Deep in my soul and nothing wrong
 Or mean or small can touch my heart
 Down in the vale the smokewreaths start
 To softly curl above the trees
 The fingers of a vagrant breeze
 Steal tenderly across my hair
 And toil is fled and want and care

 The dawn is here
 I climb the hill
 My very oxen seem to thrill
 To feel the mystery of day
 The sun creeps out and far away
 From manmade law I worship God
 Who made the light the cloud the sod
 I worship smilingly and sing
   
 The dawn is here and with itspring





THE HAUNTED HOUSE

 It stands neglected silent far from the ways of men
 A lonely little cottage beside a lonely glen
 And dreaming there I saw it when sunsets golden
 rays
 Had touched it with the glory of other sweeter days

 They say the house is haunted andwell it is I
 guess
 For every empty window just aches with loneliness
 With loneliness that tortures and memory that flays
 Ah yes the house is haunted with ghosts of other
 days

 The ghost of childish laughter rings on the narrow
 stair
 And from a silent corner the murmur of a prayer
 Steals out and then a love song and then a bugle
 call
 And steps that do not falter along the quiet hall

 The story of the old house that stands beside the
 glen
 That story is forgotten by every one but when
 The house is touched and softened by sunsets golden
 rays
 I know that ghosts must haunt it the ghosts of
 sweeter days





TO A PAIR OF GLOVES

 Jus a little pair o gloves
 Sorter thin an worn
 With th fingers neatly darned
 Like they had been torn
 Jus a little pair o gloves
 Not s much ter see
 Not a soul on earth can guess
 What they mean ter me

 Jus a little pair o gloves
 Sorter tossed aside
 Limp an quiet folded up
 Like their soul had died
 Every finger seems ter look
 Lonely an my hand
 Trembles as it touches them
 Who can understand

 Jus a little pair o gloves
 Ah she tossed em there
 Singinlike she turned ter go
 Didnt have a care
 Kissin them A prayer a tear
 God my head WILL bow
 Jus a little pair o gloves
  Empty now




PEAKS

 A storm may rage in the world below
 It may tear great trees apart
 But here on the mountain top I know
 That it cannot touch my heart

 I have struggled up through the lightnings glare
 I have walked where the cliffs fell sheer
 To a gorge below but I breathed a prayer
 And my soul passed doubt and fear

 Here on the mountain top the air
 Is clear as a silver song
 And the sun is warm on my unbound hair
 AND WHAT THOUGH THE WAY WAS LONG

 What though the way was steep and bleak
 And what though the road was hard
 I stand at last on the mountain peak
 With my eyes upraised to God

 A storm may sweep through the world below
 It may rend great rocks apart
 But here on the crest of the world I know
 That it cannot touch my heart





LIL FELLER

 When th sunshines goldenyeller
 Like th curls upon his head
 Then he wakesth lil feller
 An he jumps up outen bed
 An he scrambles fer his knickers
 Flung perhaps upon th floor
 An he takes his hat my old un
 An he races through th door
 An I hear his voice asingin
 In his odd olefashioned way
 Cause hes gladth lil feller
 In th mornin o the day

 Kinder makes me feel well lazy
 So I hurry up outside
 Where th mountains smile down friendly
 And th earth looks sorter wide
 An I hear his voice acallin
 Sayin Daddy come an see
 An I find him makin gardens
 Where a rock pile uster be
 An I shout How goes it sonny
 An my heart feels light an gay
 Fer hes singinlil feller
 In th mornin o th day

 Lil feller an his gardens
 It dont matter much ter him
 If th hoeins hard an tedgious
 An th crop he grows is slim
 Fer he loves ter be aworkin
 An he loves ter see things start
 Outer nothin Theres a garden
 In th rockbed o my heart
 That hes planted just by singin
 In his odd olefashioned way
 Cause hes glad MY LIL FELLER
 In th mornin o th day




TO AN OLD SCHOOLHOUSE

 Down by the end of the lane it stands
 Where the sumac grows in a crimson thatch
 Down where the sweet wild berry patch
 Holds out a lure for eager hands
 Down at the end of the lane who knows
 The ghosts that sit at the wellscarred seats
 When the moon is dark and the gray sky meets
 With the dawn time light and a chill wind blows

 Ghostswell not ghosts perhaps but dreams
 Rather like wistful shades that stand
 Waiting a look or an outstretched hand
 To call them back where the morning gleams
 Dreams of the hopes we had that died
 Dreams of the vivid youth we sold
 Dreams of a pot of rainbow gold
 Gold that we sought for eagereyed

 Dreams of the plans we made that sleep
 With the lesson books on the dusty rack
 Of the joyous years that will not come back
 That are drowned in the tears we have learned to
 weep
 Ghosts did I call them Sweet they are
 As a plant that grows in a desert place
 Sweet as a dear remembered face
 Sweet as a pale courageous star

 Where the sumac grows in a flaming wall
 It stands at the end of a little lane
 And there do the children come again
 Answering still the bells shrill call
 Just as we came with their songs unsung
 And their hopes all new and their dreams dew
 kissed
 Brave as the sun in a land of mist
 JUST AS WE CAME WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG




THE OLD SAILOR

 Ive crossed the bar at last mates
 My longest voyage is done
 And I can sit here peaceful
 And watch th setting sun
 Asmilin kind of glad like
 Upon the waves so free
 My longest voyage is done mates
 But oh the heart of me
 Is out where sea meets skyline
 My longest voyage is done
 Butcan I sit in peace mates
 And watch the settin sun

 For whats a peaceful life mates
 When every breeze so free
 When every gale ablowin
 Brings messages to me
 And is the sky so shinin
 For all its golden sun
 To one who loves the sea mates
 And knows his voyage is done
 And can a year on land mates
 Match with one dayat sea
 Ah every wind asingin
 Brings memory to me

 Ive crossed the bar at last mates
 My longest voyage is past
 And I must watch the sunset
 Must see it fade at last
 My steps are not so light mates
 As they were years ago
 And sometimes when Im tired
 My head droops kind of low
 Yet though Im old andweary
 The waves that dance so free
 Keep callin to my soul mates
 And thrill the heart of me





THE RIVER AND THE TREE

 You are white and tall and swaying sang the river
 to the tree
 And your leaves are touched with silverbut you
 never smile on me
 For your branches murmur love songs to the sun
 kissed turquoise sky
 And you seem so far above me that I always hurry
 by

 You are laughing in your shallows you are somber
 in your deeps
 And below your shining surface theres a heart that
 never sleeps
 But all day you pass me dancing and at evening
 time you dream
 And I didnt think you liked me sang the birch
 tree to the stream

 So they got a bit acquainted on a glowing summer
 day
 And they found they liked each other which is often
 times the way
 And the river got so friendly and it ran so very slow
 That the birchtree shone reflected in the water down
 below





AUTUMN SONG

 Lets go down the road together you and I
 Lets go down the road together
 Through the vivid autumn weather
 Lets go down the road together when the red leaves
 fly
 Lets go searching searching after
 Joy and mirth and love and laughter
 Lets go down the road together you and I

 Lets go hunting for adventure you and I
 For the romance we are knowing
 Waits for us alive and glowing
 For the romance that has always passed us by
 Lets have done with tears and sighing
 What if summertime IS dying
 Lets go hunting for adventure you and I

 Lets go down the road together you and I
 And if you are frightened lest you
 Weary grow my arms will rest you
 As we take the road together when the red leaves fly
 Springtime is the time for mating
 Ah a deeper love is waiting
 Down the autumn road that calls us you and I




THE CITY
 TOWERS AND CANYONS AND SLUMS
 MAN BUILT

 AND SOULS
 GOD BUILT





SCARLET FLOWERS

 The window box across the street
 Is filled with scarlet flowers
 They glow like bits of sunset cloud
 Across the dragging hours
 What though the mist be like a shroud
 What though the day be dreary
 The window box across the street
 Is warm and gay and cheery

 The window box across the street
 Is filled with scarlet flowers
 I almost catch their perfume sweet
 Above the sound of tramping feet
 They sing of country bowers
 Against the house that looms so gray
 They smile inwell a friendly way

 A tired shop girl hurries by
 Their color seems to catch her eye
 She pauses starts and wistfully
 She gazes up It seems to me
 That I can hear her longing sigh
 A little shop girl hurries by

 A newsboy stops to sell his wares
 The crowds brush by him no one cares
 To buy his papers But above
 The scarlet flowers bravely grow
 In token of the Fathers love
 The crowds brush coldly by below


 A blind man stumbles groping past
 He cannot see their scarlet shine
 And yet some memory seems to twine
 About his soul
 For oh he turns
 As trusting as a child who yearns
 For some vague dream and smilingly
 He lifts the eyes that cannot see
 A blind man stumbles groping past

 The window box across the street
 Is filled with scarlet flowers
 They tell a secret tender sweet
 Through all the dreary hours
 And folk who hurry on their way
 Dream of some other brighter day
 The window box across the street
 Is filled with scarlet flowers





ON FIFTH AVENUE

 I walked down Fifth Avenue the other day
 In the languid summertime everybody strolls down
 Fifth Avenue
 And I passed women dainty in their filmy frocks
 And much bespatted men with canes
 And great green busses lumbered past me
 And impressive limousines and brisk little lectrics

 I walked down Fifth Avenue the other day
 And the sunshine smiled at me
 And something deep in my heart burst into song
 And then all at once I saw her
 A woman with painted lips and rougetouched
 cheeks
 Standing in front of a jewelers window
 She was looking at diamonds
 A tray of great bluewhite diamonds
 And I saw a flame leap out of her eyes to meet them
 Greedy eyes they were and cold like tooperfect
 jewels
 And I realized for the first time
 That diamonds werent always pretty

 And then I SAW THE OTHER ONE
 A thin little girl looking into a florists shop
 At a fragrant mass of violets dewpurple and fresh
 She carried a huge box on her arm
 And a man passing said loudly
 I guess somebodys hatll be late today
 And the thin little girl flushed and hurried on
 But not before I had seen the tenderness in her eyes
 The tenderness that real women show
 When they look at vast rolling hills or flowers or
 very small pink babies

 I walked down Fifth Avenue the other day
 All the world walks leisurely down Fifth Avenue
 in the summertime




FROM A CITY WINDOW

 The dust is thick on the city street
 The smoke on the city sky
 Hangs dense and gray at the close of day
 And the city crowds surge by
 With heavy feet through the summer heat
 Like a sluggish sullen tide
 But hand in hand through a magic land
 We are wandering side by side

 For somewhere dear theres a magic land
 On the shores of a silver sea
 And there is a boat with turquoise sails
 With sails that are wide and free
 A boat that is whirling through the spray
 That is coming for you and me

 Somewhere dear theres a singing breeze
 That creeps through the laughing air
 To the wideflung boughs of a blueblack tree
 It touches your joyous hair
 And the touch of it is as soft and light
 As a babys lisping prayer

 Somewhere dear theres a bit of beach
 Where the sand is warm and white
 Where the sky seems close and the drifting clouds
 Are tenderly warmly bright
 And there is a ship with turquoise sails
 With sails like a living light

 Ah the ship is bringing us dreams come true
 And hopes that are all dewkissed
 It is bringing us days that are all aglow
 With scarlet and amethyst
 Bringing us faith to find our way
 Through a world that is wrapped in mist

 Our window looks on the city street
 We can glimpse the city sky
 But our hearts are gay at the close of day
 Though the tired crowds pass by
 With heavy feet through the blinding heat
 Like a sullen sluggish tide
 For hand in hand through a magic land
 We are wandering side by side





THE LADY ACROSS THE COURT

 She only comes when night is near
 And stands a moment quietly
 Beside her window in the dusk
 She lives across the court from me
 And though I cannot see her eyes
 Because she is too far away
 I somehow feel that they are kind
 And very soft and widely gray

 Her hands are only dim white blurs
 That rest against the window pane
 And yet I know that they are firm
 And cool and sweet as April rain
 And oh I cannot help but wish
 As through the dark I go to bed
 That they might rest a moment like
 A little prayer upon my head

 She only comes when night is near
 I do not know who she can be
 I never see her anywhere
 But just across the court from me
 I am so small the curtains hide
 The wistful smiles that I have smiled
 And yet I somehow think she feels
 The love of mea lonely child





TO A PORCELAIN PUPPY DOG

 Oh pudgy porcelain puppy dog from faraway Japan
 I saw you in a shop today where lonesomely you
 sat
 Upon a velvet cushion that was colored gold and
 purple
 Between a bowl of goldfish and a sleeping wooden
 cat

 I wonder what you thought about as stolidly you sat
 there
 A grin of faint derision on your pudgy porcelain
 face
 I wonder if you dreamed about some cherry blossom
 tea house
 And if the goldfish bored you in their painted
 Chinese case

 I wonder if you dreamed about the laughter of the
 geishas
 As languidly they danced across the shining
 lacquered floor
 I wonder if your thoughts were with a purple clump
 of iris
 That bloomed all through the summer by the
 little tea house door

 I wonder if you hated us who passed you by unheeding
 You who had known the temples of another older
 land
 And oh I wonder if you knew when I had paused
 beside you
 To pat you porcelain puppy dog that I could
 understand





COLORS

 I love color
 I love flaming reds
 And vivid greens
 And royal flaunting purples
 I love the startled rose of the sun at dawning
 And the blazing orange of it at twilight

 I love color
 I love the drowsy blue of the fringed gentian
 And the yellow of the goldenrod
 And the rich russet of the leaves
 That turn at autumntime
 I love rainbows
 And prisms
 And the tinsel glitter
 Of every shopwindow

 I love color
 And yet today
 I saw a brown little bird
 Perched on the dullgray fence
 Of a weedfilled city yard
 And as I watched him
 The little bird
 Threw back his head
 Defiantly almost
 And sang a song
 That was full of gay ripples
 And poignant sweetness
 And halfhidden melody

 1 love color
 I love crimson and azure
 And the glowing purity of white
 And yet today
 I saw a living bit of brown
 A vague oasis on a streak of gray
 That brought heaven
 Very near to me





POSSESSION
 A TENEMENT MOTHER SPEAKS

 Y aint as pretty as some babies are
 But oh yer mine
 Yer lil fingers sorter seem t twine
 Aroun my soul
 Yer eyes are bright t me as any star
 Yer hairs like gol

 Some people say yer hair is sandyred
 An that yer eyes is sorter wan an pale
 An that yer lil body looks well frail
 Y aint been fed
 Like rich folks children are
 It takes fresh air
 Ter keep a baby fat an strong an pink
 It takes more care
 N I have time ter give
 An yet if Godll only let yer live

 When yer first came
 An when I seen yer face deep down inside
 My heart I feltwell sorter broke an tore
 Cause when yer came ter me I like ter died
 An I had lost my job there at th store
 I looked at you an oh it wasnt pride
 I felt but bitterness an shame

 An then yer gropin fingers touched my hand
 As helpless as a snowflake in the air
 Yer didnt know yer couldnt understand
 Cause yer was new t this coldhearted land
 That life aint fair
 Yer didnt know if I was good r bad
 R much ter see
 Y only knew that I belonged an oh
 Yer trusted me

 Somehow right there I didnt stop ter think
 That yer was white an thininstead o pink
 An that yer lips an not yer eyes was blue
 I got t thinkin how when work was through
 Id sing t yer an rock yer off t rest
 I got t thinkin that I had been blessed
 More than th richest girl Id ever knew
 An oh I held yer tight against my breast
 An lookin far ahead I dreamed an planned
 That I would work th fingers off my hand
 Fer you
 An motherlove swept on me like a tide
 An oh I cried

 Some people say yer hair is sandyred
 But they dont know
 They say yer eyes is sorter pale an weak
 But it aint so
 Its jus because yer never been well fed
 An never had a lil cribby bed
 Its jus because yer never had a peek
 At th blue sky
 Thats why

 Yer aint so pretty as some babies are
 But oh t me yer like a silver star
 That through th darkest night can smile an
 shine
 Yer aint as pretty as some babies are
 But God yer mine





LIGHTS OF THE CITY

 He was young
 And his mind
 Was filled with the science of economics
 That he had studied in college
 And as we talked about the food riots
 And high prices
 And jobless men
 He said
 Its all stupid and wrong
 This newspaper talk
 Folk have no business to starve
 The price of labor always advances
 Proportionally
 With the price of food

 Any man he said
 A moment later
 Can earn at least two dollars a day
 By working on a railroad
 Or in the street cleaning department
 What if potatoes DO cost
 Eight cents a pound
 Wages are high too
 People have no reason to starve

 I listened to him prayerfully
 More or less
 For I had never been to college
 And I didnt know much about economics

 But
 As I walked to the window
 And looked out over the veiled mysterious lights
 Of the city
 I couldnt help thinking
 Of a little baby
 That I had seen a few days ago
 A baby of the slumsthin and joyless
 And old of face
 But with eyes
 Like the eyes of the Christ Child 
 A babycrying for bread

 And I wondered





STEEL

 They think that were just animals almost
 We men who work with steel
 A lady visitor was here th other day
 She looked at me an I could hear her say
 My what a life I spose his only boast
 Is muscles
 Shes wrong We feel
 A certain pride a certain sort o joy
 When some great blazin mass is tamed an turned
 Into an engine wheel Our hands get burned
 An sometimes half our hair is scorched away
 But well its fun
 Perhaps youve seen a boy
 Who did hard work he loved an called it play
 Know what I mean Well thats the way we feel
 We men who work with steel

 A lady visitor was here th other day
 She held her skirts right dainty in her hand
 An as she passed me by I heard her say
 I wonder what he THINKSor if his head
 Is just a piece o metal too She said
 It laughinlike
 She didnt understand
 She couldnt know that we have dreams as grand
 As any SHE could have We wonder where
 Th rivets that we make are goin to
 An if th engine wheels we turn will go
 Through tropic heat or if theyll plow through snow
 An as we watch we sorter grow to care
 About th steel Why its as shiny blue
 As jewls An every bit is well a part
 Of life to us Sometimes my very heart
 Thanks God that Ive a mansized job to do




MUSIC OF THE SLUMS




I THE VIOLINMAKER

 Over a slum his sign swings out
 Over a street where the citys shout
 Is deadened into a sob of pain
 Where even joy has a minor strain

 Violins made read the sign It swings
 Over a street where sorrow sings
 Over a street where people give
 Their right to laugh for a chance to live

 He works alone with his head bent low
 And all the sorrow and all the woe
 And all the pride of a banished race
 Stare from the eyes that light his face

 But he never sighs and his slender hand
 Fastens the catgut strand by strand
 Fastens it tight but tenderly
 As if he dreams of some melody

 Some melody of his yesterday
 Will it I wonder find its way
 Out to the world when fingers creep
 Over the strings that lie asleep

 Or will the citys misery
 Mould the song in a tragic key
 Making its sweetest faintest breath
 Thrill with sorrow and throb with death

 Maker of musicwho can know
 Where the work of his hand shall go
 Maybe its slightest phrase will bring
 Comfort to ease the suffering

 Maybe his dreams will have their part
 Buried deep in the musics heart
 Out of a chain of dreary days
 Joy may come as some master plays

 Over a slum his sign hangs out
 Over a street where dread meets doubt
 Violins made reads the sign It swings
 Over a street where sorrow sings




II THE PARK BAND

 Side by side and silenteagerly they stand
 Souls look out of tired eyes hands are clasped
 together
 Through the thrilling softness of the late spring
 weather
 All a city slum is out to listen to the band

 Young love and Maytime hear the joyous strain
 Listen to a serenade written long ago
 You will recognize the songyou who care must
 know
 Fear that blends with happiness joy that touches
 pain

 Rabbi with the grizzled beard hear adventures story
 Hear the tale the music tells thrilling with ro
 mance
 Hear the clatter of a sword hear a broken lance
 Falling from some heros hand red with blood
 stained glory

 Tenements on either side lightflecked in the gloam
 ing
 Tenements on either side stark and tall and gray
 Ah the folk who line your halls wander far away
 All a crowded city slum is agypsie roaming

 Woman with the brooding gaze hear the lilting
 laughter
 Of the children that you loved feel their soft
 lipped kisses
 Think of all the little joys that a hard world
 misses
 What though bitter loneliness always follows after

 Gangster with the shifty eyes listen to the sighing
 Of the hymn tune that you heard at your mothers
 knee
 Listen to the restless ghost of the usedtobe
 Listen to a wistful ghosts emptyhearted crying

 Tenements on either sidemenacing they stand
 Lightflecked in the softness of the late spring
 weather
 But young love and broken life are standing close
 together
 And all a city slum is out to listen to the band




III THE ORGAN MAN

 Hes very old his music box is old and rusty too
 And half the notes of it are harsh and half of
 them are slow
 One wonders if the coat he wears could ever have
 been new
 And if the tune he plays was quite forgotten long
 ago

 He finds a sunny place to stand and lifts his bleary
 eyes
 And smiles a bita toothless smile half touched
 perhaps with fear
 And though he cannot see them he is looking at the
 skies
 As if he prays but silently for hope and faith
 and cheer

 The foreign women pass him by their tarnished coins
 held tight
 They toss their heads and will not hear his musics
 wistful hum
 But through each alley way and street like moths
 that seek the light
 With eager eyes and laughing lips the little chil
 dren come

 He plays his ancient shaky song his mouth moves to
 its sway
 He does not know the tune of it is old and out of
 key
 For through his eyes a soul stares out that wanders
 far away
 In some fair land of youth and lovesome land
 that used to be

 The little children cluster close bareheaded bare of
 limb
 They hold their ragged frocks and dance they do
 not careor know
 That they are like a garden place a fragrant dream
 to him
 Or that the tune he plays was quite forgotten long
 ago




BE OF GOOD CHEER

 Temptation came to me today
 And oh I felt that I must stray
 Down primrose paths forgetting all
 The citys fevered siren call
 Spoke to my soul its whispered cry
 Said Live for Youth too soon will die

 So all alone when work was done
 I sought the park The setting sun
 Had left a bit of warmth for me
 I found a bench beneath a tree
 And sat and thought
 My life is hard
 Sometimes my heart seems battlescarred
 With longings keen and bitter fears
 And want and suffering and tears

 Temptation spoke and Youth spoke back
 The night seemed cold and grimly black
 And every light was like a star
 That cleft the skythey were so far
 So very far away And I
 Was lonely there beneath the sky

 There used to be a little farm
 A tiny place remote from harm
 There used to be a mother frail
 And sweet with hair as silverpale
 As the faint moon She heard me say
 The words when first I learned to pray

 Above me in the silent trees
 I heard the rustles of the breeze
 It sounded like her step as light
 As dreams across an endless night
 My mother
 Ah the name so sweet
 Brought memories on noiseless feet
 And softly in the darkness there
 I breathed my little childhood prayer


 Do prayers have answers As I prayed
 A Presence came and gently laid
 A Hand upon my arm I knew
 That Someone kind and good and true
 Was very near Upon my soul
 A peace swept down and left it whole
 I felt a calm steal over me
 The same that stilled the troubled sea
 Where Jesus walked
 My fears were laid
 Temptation left me unafraid
 And as I smiled there in the park
 A voice spoke through the fragrant dark
 Be of good cheer the words rang out
 Like music through the citys shout

 And all the lights that I could see
 Were stars of home agleam for me




FROM MY ROOM

 I love you dear
 Here alone in my room tonight it is all that matters
 Out through my window vaguely hushed the city
 clatters
 Telling ever its tale of woe and mirth
 Sighing ever its song of death and birth
 Singing ever its potent mad refrain
 Swept with tears and the bitter weight of pain

 Here in my room I kneel alone to pray
 But there seems very little dear to say
 Even to God So kneeling by my bed
 I think dim thoughts and dream long dreams instead
 Wideeyed I kneel and watch the candle flame
 Making swift shadows on the wall your name
 Throbs in my heart and makes my pulse to thrill
 Wideeyed I kneel with soul alight until
 Somewhere a clock starts chiming It is
 late
 Out through the dark wan tenderness and hate
 Press pale kisses upon the citys lips
 Dawn comes creeping the weary nighttime slips
 Furtively by like some hurt thief with plunder
 Dear I cross to my window and I wonder
 Whether you are asleep or if you lie
 Sleepless beneath the smokehung purple sky

 Down in the streets the tired city vaguely clatters
 Here alone in my room I stand and nothing matters
 Only I love you




THE BALCONY SCENES

 The stage is set like a garden
 And the lights are flickering and low
 And a Romeo with fat legs
 Is telling a Juliet with dyed hair and tired
 disillusioned eyes
 That lovereal loveis the only thing in the world

 And up in the balcony of the theatre
 Where the seats cost twentyfive cents
 A slim little girl in a shiny serge frock
 And a boy with a wistful mouth
 Are holding hands
 And as they listen breathlessly to the studied voice
 of the actor
 Their fingers are all athrill
 With the music of the ages




A BOWERY PAWNSHOP

 A dusty musty little shop set in a dingy street
 A doorsill old and scarred and worn by many tired
 feet
 A row of cases vaguely glassed a safe against the
 wall
 And oh the ache of many heartsthe fabric of it
 all

 A violin with broken strings that fingers have
 caressed
 A diamondset betrothal ring that lovers lips have
 pressed
 A high shell comb a spangled fan a filmy bit of lace
 A heartshaped locket ribbontied that frames a
 laughing face

 A pair of blankets folded up an overcoat a shawl
 A tall old clock that might have chimed in some
 wainscoted hall
 And in the farthest corner where the purple shadows
 lie
 The echo of a womans sob the phantom of a sigh

 Ah weddingringsa score of themnot many of
 them new
 A grim revolver laid beside a babys tiny shoe
 A satin coat a ragged gown a goldclasped book of
 verse
 A necklace of bedraggled pearls an empty silver
 purse

 A dreary weary little shop set in a sunless place
 A little shop where love has met with sorrow and
 disgrace
 A row of cases doublelocked a safe against the wall
 And oh the ache of countless hearts that lies
 behind it all




SPRING IN THE CITY

 I saw a crocus blooming in the park
 I felt a hint of magic in the air
 I heard faint music sighing everywhere
 And so as all the world grew softly dark

 I found again the hope that never dies
 And hungrily with outflung arms I came
 Once more to you And when you spoke my
 name
 I read springtime eternal in your eyes




ROSE PETALS IN THE EARLY RAIN
 FORGOTTEN DREAMS
 AND A TORN SKETCH BOOK




LIL EMPTY CLOSET

 Theres a lil empty closet in a lil empty room
 Where th shadows lie like dust upon th floor
 It uster be HIS closet not s very long ago
 Thats why I dont go near it any more
 Every lil hook is empty ceptin one an from it

 Th whitest lil ghost that ever grew
 In a heart thats near ter breakin with its agony o
 grief 
 An empty flannel nightie piped with blue

 Jus a lil flannel nightie that was shrunken in th
 wash
 In spots th blue has ran inter th white
 But Ive seen him in it sleepy when I tucked th
 covers in
 An kissed him soft an took away th light
 Jus a lil flannel nightie hangin empty on a hook
 As if it was ashamedor in disgrace
 Jus a lil flannel nightie an it aint no use no more
 But I couldnt bear t take it from its place

 Jus a lil empty closet in a lil empty room
 Where th shadows lie like dust upon th floor
 It uster be his closet where Id put his clothes away
 Thats why I hate ter go there any more
 But Ive left his lil nightie hangin on a single hook
 I sorter had ter leave it there I guess
 Ah that lil empty closet in that lil empty room
 Is crowdedcrowded ful o loneliness





TWO LULLABYS

 I To A DREAM BABY

 Oh little child whose face I cannot see
 I feel your presence very near tonight
 I feel the warmth of you creep close to me
 The grey moths drift across the candlelight
 And tiny shadows sway across the floor
 Like wistful elves who do a fairy dance
 The wind is tapping softly at the door
 And rain is beating like a silver lance
 Against the tightly curtained window pane
 Oh little child whose face I cannot see
 The loneliness the twilight and the rain
 Have brought your dearness very close to me
 And though I rock with empty arms I sing
 A lullaby that I have made to croon
 Into your drowsy shadow eara song
 About the star sheep and the shepherd moon




II POPPY LAND

 Sleep little tired eyes close to the heart of me
 Sleep while the sun trembles low in the west
 You who are dream of my dreams and a part of
 me
 Sleep with your head lying warm on my breast

 Dear theres a land that is filled with red flowers
 Poppies they call them that sway in the breeze
 Sometimes their petals in soft scarlet showers
 Fall in warm drifts that are high as your
 knees
 Dear in your dreams you will laugh as you roll
 through them
 Waving your arms in an effort to creep
 Gently they nod as the wind sings its soul through
 them
 Sleep little tired eyes sleep

 Dear in this land theres a sky like a feather
 Blue in some places or white as a star
 And theres a fragrancea plant thats called heather
 Grows in the spot where the butterflies are
 Dear there are pastures as gay as glad laughter
 Dotted with hundreds of woolly white sheep
 Dear you can pat them for theyll follow after
 You as you sleep

 Dream little tired eyes close to the breast of me
 Wander in fields where red flowers are gloaming
 All of my heart wanders with you the rest of me
 Watches your dreaming




I DREAMED YOUR FACE

 I dreamed your face one night when Heaven seemed
 resting
 Against the troubled fever of the earth
 I dreamed that vivid throated birds were nesting
 In trees that shook with elfinhearted mirth
 I dreamed that starlike purple flowers were springing
 Athrob with perfume all about the place
 And that there was a faroff sound of singing
 And thenI dreamed your face

 I dreamed your face and then I waked from
 dreaming
 The creeping dawn seemed very cold and bare
 The rising sun seemed pallid in its beaming
 Because its coming did not find you there
 And II rose despondent in the morning
 As one whose burning thirst has not been slaked
 I dreamed your face a wonder world adorning
 And thenI waked

 And so I went upon a quest to find you
 A quest that led through many bitter years
 I journeyed far with strands of love to bind you
 And found not you but bitterness and tears
 So I returned discouraged through the gloaming
 My shoulders bowed with weariness unguessed
 I came back unsuccessful from my roaming
 My sorry quest

 I had a bit of garden that I tended
 It helped me dream again my dream of you
 It was a joyous place of colors blended
 A place where pansies and Sweet William grew
 And one bright day I hummed as I was planting
 A border row of flowers slim and fair
 And raised my eyes to see pale sunlight slanting
 Across your hair




ANSWER

 I am myselfyou cannot take my dreams
 And pull the filmy stuff of them apart
 I am myselfand life IS what it seems
 I am myself and love is in my heart
 You cannot make me think by fast set rule
 You cannot laugh beliefs like mine away
 Experience MAY be a bitter school
 And yet The golden sun shines every day
 And stars at night lend magic to the sky
 And all the world is vividly aglow
 You cannot make me pause to question why
 For we who dare to dream have learned to know

 THE WORLD IS RIGHT There is a friendly One
 Who smiles when we have tried to do our part
 I will not flinch my journeys just begun
 I AM MYSELFYOU CANNOT BREAK MY HEART




A BABYS HANDS

 God made the rivers the hills and the seas
 God made the flowers the grass and the trees
 God made the clouds and the waves silvercrested
 Then God made the hands of a babyand rested

 How did He make them Well nobody knows
 Some say He dreamed of the bud of a rose
 And that He woke as the dawn swept away
 Night in the dancing pink promise of day

 Maybe He thought of the light of a star
 Thats why He made them as soft as they are
 Maybe He watched while a new butterfly
 Light as a sunbeam went fluttering by

 Maybe He walked in a garden dewkissed
 Thats why He made them as frail as the mist
 Then as He leaned from His heaven above
 God made them strong as His greatest giftLOVE

 God made the mountainswe wonder at these
 God made the splendor of sunsets and trees
 God made vast mines where a worlds wealth is piled
 Then God made the hands of a babyand smiled





ALL ALONG THE BROAD HIGHWAY

 All along the broad highway the little dreams were
 growing
 White as hope and red as life and bluer than the
 sea
 All along the broad highway I felt their petals
 blowing
 Like a storm of fragrant snow across the lips of
 me
 So I danced with joyous heart and bent above them
 singing
 So I skipped along the road and smiled into the
 skies
 ALL ALONG THE BROAD HIGHWAY THE LITTLE DREAMS WERE
 SPRINGING
 FRAGRANT AS THE DEW OF STARS AND GLAD AS BUTTERFLIES

 All along the broad highway I danced and sang unheeding
 Till One came with haughty step and traveled by
 my side
 Traveled first beside my path then suddenly was
 leading
 One who drew me after him and murmured I AM
 PRIDE
 All along the broad highway I hurried ever faster
 Faster through the purple dust that blinded like
 a mist
 Blinded me until I felt that only Pride was master
 And I saw the little dreams through clouds of
 amethyst

 All along the broad highway I toiled no longer
 glancing
 Anywhere but straight ahead I had no
 heart to sing
 All along the broad highway my feet no longer
 dancing
 Followed I the steps of Pride and felt the thick
 dust sting
 In the tired eyes of me the eyes too sad for
 weeping
 Still I struggledstruggled on until quite
 suddenly
 All the strength that kept me up seemed drowsy
 almost sleeping
 And I paused with drooping head and lo Pride
 went from me

 All along the broad highway the silent dusk was
 stealing
 Quite alone I stood and stared about me in the
 gloom
 And the voice of me was still and my heart was
 kneeling
 Like a weary pilgrim soul in an attic room
 And I stretched my empty hands to where the ghostly
 lighting
 Showed a crumpled mist of blue a heap of white
 and red
 There along the broad highway like armies after
 fighting
 All the gallant little dreams were lying gaunt and
 dead

HEREDITY

 You told me last night
 In a strange and sudden burst of confidence
 That a New England ancestor of yours
 Had burned witches
 And at last I knew

 Why your eyes are always so grim
 And why your mouth is cut
 In a straight line
 And why you can never see beauty and mirth
 In the sweep of wind over a wheat field
 Or in the sunlight on a babys hair
 At last I knew
 Why you can never see romance
 In the long gypsie trail
 Or magic
 In the still purple woods

 I knew why life
 To you
 Was something to be struggled with
 Not a glorious adventure
 And why death was the end of things
 And not the beginning
 And I knew at last
 Why you could never understand
 That tears may cover laughter
 And that laughter may be a veil
 For tears

 You told me last night
 That an ancestor of yours
 Had burned witches
 And oh as I sat in the candlelight
 Watching you
 I couldnt help wishing
 That somewhere behind you in the shadows

 There was another ancestor
 A gay cavalier ancestor
 Who rode hard
 And fought with his sword
 And wore his hat rakishly
 On the back of his head
 And knewlove





APRIL

 I had not meant to love againall that was lost to
 me
 For I had felt loves fear and pain as well as ecstasy
 I closed my heart and locked the door and tossed
 away the key

 All through the wintertime I sat before my flaming
 fire
 And listened to the sleighbells chime and watched
 the flames leap higher
 To grasp at shadows sombrehued with fiendish red
 desire

 And then mad April came againI felt the breezes
 blowing
 And I forgot the fear the pain I only knew
 that glowing
 In shady nook and garden spot pale hyacinths were
 growing

 And when across the perfumed lea for nothing could
 defeat him 
 My vagrant love crept back to me I did not
 mean to greet him
 But April opened up my heart and oh I ran to
 meet him





THE DESERT PATHSEVEN SONNETS

 I

 The camel tracks led whitely across the desert sand
 And one came riding after with furtive mystery
 Ah one came swiftly riding a dagger in his hand
 And he was bent on plundera nomad thief was he
 He did not heed the starshine that glimmered from
 on high
 For laden beasts had traveled along the lonely way
 He did not see the glory that swept the Eastern sky
 For he had far to journey before the dawn of day

 He followed through the desert and then at last he
 saw
 An inn upon the outskirts of some small village place
 And there were camels resting before the stable
 door
 He left his horse crept nearer with greed upon his
 face
 And peering oer the threshold he saw that gold was
 piled
 With precious stones and incense before a little
 Child


 II

 A thief he was by calling who to the stable came
 A thief whose youthful fingers had learned to steal
 their fill
 A thief he was who valued his heritage of shame
 YET STANDING BY THAT DOORWAY HE DID NOT WANT TO
 KILL
 A thief he was butwatchinghe saw a Baby face
 And bending near a Mother whose joy was undefiled
 And for one breathless moment across the stable
 space
 The Babys eyes gazed at himAND THEN THE BABY
 SMILED

 A thief he was by calling but there beside the door
 He saw a Holy Visionhe knelt and tried to pray
 And something thrilling whispered of love forever
 more
 And then he rose half weepingand it was Christmas Day
 A thief he was by calling who felt the Fathers plan
 But back across the desert there silent rode a man


 III

 The years are met as milestones upon a winding road
 And some slip by like shadows and some are fair
 with flowers
 And some seem dreary hopelessa leaden chain of
 hours
 And some are like a heartthrob and some a heavy
 load
 The thief a thief no longer a lonely figure strode
 Heartweary down lifes pathway through tempest
 and through showers
 But always prayed that somewhere among sweet
 scented bowers
 A Babys smile might show him where happiness
 abode

 For he was often hungrya thief reformed must
 eat
 And there were folk who shunned him and turned
 his plea away
 And there were those who scourged him from out
 the market place
 They were the ones who told him to earn his bread
 and meat
 Yet ever he walked onward and dreamed of some
 fair day
 When he would find the ChristChild with love upon
 His face


 IV

 Where work lay for the asking it seemed that men
 MIGHT work
 But prejudice was rampant in every shop and field
 And What if you ARE trying MY scythe you may
 not wield
 Men told the thief who answeredIndeed I will
 not shirk
 And carpenters and builders turned from him with
 a smirk
 And farmers hurried by him to house the harvests
 yield
 And so he took his dagger all rusted and his shield
 And sought again the highway where thieves and
 jackals lurk

 And yet the spark of manhood still flamed within his
 heart
 And still he saw the Baby beyond the stable door
 And oftentimes at even as crimson daytime died
 He knelt a sorry figure from all of life apart
 And Oh if I could see Himand feel His love
 once more
 If I could see Him smiling I would not steal he
 cried


 V

 It was a glowing ruby that caused the thief to fall
 Buthe was very hungry and lonely too and cold
 And youth lay all behind him a tattered funeral
 pall
 For he was very tired and he was growing old
 It was a glowing ruby that lay upon the breast
 Of one who had not earned it who wore it with a
 sneer
 The thief was very weary he only longed for rest
 He was too wan for caring he was too numb for fear

 It was a glowing rubyhe held it in his hand
 His hand was thin and withered it shook beneath
 the gem
 He took the vivid ruby the ransom of a land
 And tied it firmly tightly within his garments hem
 And then he shuffled forward but like a thorn
 within
 His soul he bore the torment of bitterness and sin


 VI

 They caught him when the morning had tinged the
 Eastern skies
 The gem was found upon him as red as guilty blood
 He stood his head sunk forward with listless shal
 low eyes
 And hopelessness submerged him like some unholy
 flood
 A Thief he was by calling The law The law
 was great
 What chance had he for pity His fate was sealed
 and done
 He was unclean an outcast a menace to the state
 A thing to be avoided a stain against the sun

 They led him to his hearing the hall was still and
 light
 A judge was seated higher who passed him with a
 glance
 And suddenly forgetting his weariness and fright
 The thief cried leaping forward I did not have a
 chance
 The judgment hall was spacious and coldly white
 and wide
 And coldly came the sentenceHe shall be crucified


 VII

 They nailed him Gods creation upon a cross of
 shame
 They nailed him up with laughter they heeded not
 his tears
 And people looking at him were moved to soulless
 jeers
 And agony was on hima searing breathless flame
 And then as he hung sobbing a sudden feeling came
 Of peace that reaching toward him across the sound
 of sneers
 Was like a burst of music that one more feels than
 hears
 For from somewhere beside him a Voice had
 breathed his name

 Ah he was weak with anguish and yet he turned his
 head
 And saw a cross beside him and on the cross a Form
 And he forgot the tumult the horror and the storm
 And someone down below him said Look the thief
 is dead
 But safe from fear and torture beyond their scornful cries
 The thief had gazed at Heaven in Christs triumphant
 eyes





SUMMER SONG

 If I might go with my True Love
 To some far dreamswept land
 Id be content to sit all day
 Upon the silver sand
 And watch the sea come creeping in
 The sighing singing sea
 If I might go to some far land
 And take True Love with me

 If I could go with my True Love
 To some far lonely place
 The world might well be lost and I
 Could look upon Loves face
 And wealth would seem a little thing
 While happiness might be
 If I could go to some far land
 And take True Love with me

 Ah Love would smile and ruffle up
 The hair above my brow
 And we would laugh at all that seems
 So very sober now
 And monkeyfolk and scarlet birds
 Would peer from every tree
 And try to understand the words
 My True Love said to me

 If I might go with my True Love
 To some far dreamswept land
 I would not miss the world for I
 Could always touch Loves hand
 And feel the magic of his lips
 Oh by the singing sea
 And Edenplace would bloom anew
 For my True Love and me




COMPREHENSIONA MOTHERS SONG

 I KNOW HOW MARY FELT THERE IN THE HAY
 MY LITTLE SON WAS BORN ON CHRISTMAS DAY

 I know as she bent tenderly above Him
 She did not think of majesty or power
 For he was hersand she was there to love Him
 His hands as pinkly tinted as a flower
 Seemed all too small to carve His deathless story
 What though a star gleamed glorious to guide
 Him
 She snatched Him to her breast as if to hide Him
 From harm and fear and evenyes from glory

 And when the wise men came to give their treasure
 She smiled at them as proud as any queen
 She scarcely saw the jewels in countless measure
 The gold that gleamed her gaze was far serene
 Upon the hills where shepherds watched alone
 She did not think of crosses or of dying
 For He was just a drowsy baby lying
 Wrapped in her loveA babyall her own

 I KNOW HOW MARY FELT THERE IN THE HAY
 MY LITTLE SON WAS BORN ON CHRISTMAS DAY




SINGING ON THE MARCH

 God put a song into my heart one day
 A little song as light as ocean form
 A little song of love and hope and home
 A little song to cheer me on my way

 And though I bowed beneath the load I bore
 I found that when I sang the way was bright
 And that my footsteps swifter grew and light
 And all my life seemed fairer than before

 God has a song that fits in every heart
 And though that song may seem a tiny thing
 It is your taskso forge ahead and SING
 And you will find that you have done your part





EASTER

 He came to call last night
 And we began to talk as young folk will
 Half carelessly and half in awe of God
 It was the springtime and the night was still
 And fragrant all about us
 And the sod
 Was fresh with tender grass
 And overhead a crescent moon shone bright
 And God he said Has built the world on laws
 Like some great watch and every breathing space
 Is measured and the system has no flaws
 And nothing moves from its appointed place
 God is the Master Scientist he said
 His voice was bold and had a ring of truth
 But God seemed ponderous and far away

 And then a gentle breeze danced overhead
 And caused the timid newborn leaves to sway
 And we began to talk of love and youth

 And then I sent him home and went upstairs
 To my still room and flung the windows wide
 And as I knelt to say my evening prayers
 I saw the stars far smiling in the sky
 And all at once I knew the reason why
 I worshipped God knew why He had sent
 His son to save the world from sin and shame
 And suddenly like some sweet healing tide
 The meaning of my life swept over me
 And through the dark my groping soul could see
 The Christ Who loved us and was crucified

 And as I knelt and watched the stars faint shine
 I felt Gods hand a moment touching mine




RESURRECTION

 You took the lilt from my heart of hearts
 And the breath of song from my soul
 And the mind of me that had once been free
 And buoyantly young and whole
 Grew calm and still as a barren sea
 Where never a star beam shone
 A sea where never a ripple danced
 That reflected your face along

 I walked in a daze down wellworn paths
 Paths that your feet had trod
 I thought your thoughts and I spoke your tongue
 I knelt to your hostile God
 And the dreams that had been a part of me
 I tossed with a sigh away
 And left to rust in the misty dust
 Of the land called Yesterday

 My hands lay folded in slim repose
 Quite as you bade them rest
 Folded meek oer the leaden heart
 That tortured my gypsie breast
 And I smiled with my lipsmy eyes were numb
 I smiled for I never knew
 That the mind of me was a lifeless sea
 Reflecting the face of you

 You took the lilt from my carefree life
 And the song from my singing heart
 But there came a day when the world grew gray
 When I knew that we must part
 So I tore you out of your soulbound shrine
 And oh though it caused me pain
 I raised my face to the sky and knew
 That my song would come again




THE QUEEN

 Barefooted came the beggar maid
 So ran the minstrels lay
 Barefooted came the beggar maid
 Before the King Corpethua
 But oh her face was like a light
 Her hair was black as middle night
 And whispers ran from left to right
 She is more beautiful than day

 In robe and crown the king stepped down
 So ran the minstrels lay
 In robe and crown the king stepped down
 To meet and greet her by the way
 And so the beggar maid became
 A Queen but just a queen in name
 For with her gypsie eyes aflame
 Her mirror heard her say

 I was a beggar maid I used to lie
 Silent and unafraid beneath the sky
 And watch the starsmy little sisters they
 I used to wake at dawning time of day
 To plunge my body in some mountain stream
 I was a beggar maid
 Is this a dream
 This golden crown I wear upon my head
 This robe of royal purple and of red
 This rope of pearls this ring these silken shoon

 Not long ago the silver crescent moon
 Was like a hand that beckoned me to stray
 And cities seemed vast centuries away
 And as my feetswift feet they were and light
 Carried me through the wonder of the night
 I never thought of kings or kingly power
 My life was all one splendid singing hour

 I love my kingHe raised me from the dust
 And looked at me with wonder and with trust
 My hair hung tangled to the waist of me
 He brushed it from my eyes that he might see
 Deep into them
 He set me on his steed
 He never knew my name or asked my creed
 He just believed in meand told me so
 I love my king I love him well but oh
 Once I wore poppies red upon my brow
 A crown seems very heavy to me now
 And once I wore for all the world to see
 A gown of rags Now velvets stifle me
 And once my hands how soft they are were strong
 To toil for me
 The days seem very long
 While I must sit in state above the land
 I love my king But does he understand
 I was a beggar maid I used to lie
 Silent and unafraid beneath the sky
 And now that I am queen my being longs
 To hear once more the little slumber songs
 Of night birds nesting in some forest tree
 I want to be myself again and free
 I want to climb the crest of some great hill
 And watch the sunset clouds again and thrill
 Before the color of them I would stand
 Alone once more and see the wistful land
 Take on the tint of twilight
 I would pray
 My gypsie prayer again at close of day

 I love my kingfor he has given me
 Rare pearls the treasure of a sighing sea
 And rubies red as sunset clouds aglow
 And opals like the wistful winds that blow
 At twilighttime

 But I would wear instead
 Wild forest flowers twined about my head
 And I would dance barefooted on the sod
 An innovation to my pagan God

 Am I a queen What is this crown I wear
 I tear it from my smoothly plaited hair
 I lay my ring my rope of pearls aside
 Am I a queenam I a monarchs bride
 The soul of me is still a gypsie thing
 I pull them off the glowing gems the ring

 I love my king I love him wellbut oh
 GIVE ME MY RAGS AGAIN AND LET ME GO




FRAGMENTS

 A WITHERED ROSE

 A book of verse
 And one withered rose
 Between two pages

 My love is as faded as the petals
 But still faintly fragrant
 With sweet memories


 ASHES OF LOVE

 Dust on the letters you sent me
 And I did not know that they had been forgotten

 Does it mean that I love again




ITS LOTS OF FUN

 Its lots of fun to play around
 To dance and sing
 And not be tied to anyone
 Or anything

 Its lots of fun to live my life
 Beneath the sky
 To have no one who owns the right
 To question Why

 Its lots of fun to come and go
 Through storm and strife
 With no one by my side who hopes
 To mould my life

 But sometimes at the twilight time
 When night birds cry
 I dream perhaps that something fair
 Has passed me by

 And yetits good to play around
 To laugh and sing
 And not be tied to anyone
 Or anything





VALENTINE

 I wonder if you know up there in heaven
 That I have kept your roses crumpled now
 I wonder if you guess that still I treasure
 A faded ribbon that once touched your brow
 I wonder if you dream as dusk is falling
 Of how I read that note you sent to me
 I wonder if you think up there in heaven
 Of all the golden days that used to be

 I wonder if you smile up there in heaven
 And pass by lightly in your robes of white
 Or if you sometimes think of me a little
 You seem so near so very near tonight
 I wonder if that last shy kiss I gave you
 Can make you lonely just a bit for me
 I wonder if you long up there in heaven
 For all the golden plans that used to be

 Do they have valentines up there in heaven
 A love like mine is surely strong to go
 The little way from earth to where you wait me
 Although it be beyond the stars faint glow
 I want you dear my tired heart is calling
 My eyes are searching though they may not see
 I wonder if youre lonely there in heaven
 For all the golden dreams that used to be




THE SACRIFICE

 I started out in a cloak of pride
 With talent too that I did not hide
 I started out on Lifes stony road
 Ambitions weight was my only load
 And the way seemed fair in the dawns first glow
 And I hurriedranFOR I DID NOT KNOW

 Love smiled from a garden by the way
 And called to me but I would not stray
 From the road that stretched like a ribbon white
 Up endless hills to an endless night
 Love smiled at me but I pushed ahead
 And love fell back in the gardendead
 But I did not care as I hastened by
 And I did not pause for regret or sigh
 The road before was a path of hope
 And every hill with its gentle slope
 Led up to heights I had dreamed and prayed
 To reach some day
 Ah I might have stayed
 With Love and Youth in the garden gay
 That smiled at me from beside the way

 I plodded up and the gentle hills
 Grew hard to climb and the laughing rills
 Were torrents peopled with sodden forms
 The sky grew black with the threat of storms
 And rocks leaped out and they bruised my feet
 And faint I grew in the fever heat
 But ever on led the path that lay
 As grey as dust in the waning day
 My back was bent and my heart was sore
 And the cloak of pride that I grandly wore
 Was rent and patched and not fair to see
 Ambition talent seemed naught to me
 But I struggled on till I reached the top
 FOR ONLY THEN DID I DARE TO STOP

 I stood on the summit gazing down
 And the earth looked sordid and dull and brown
 And neutraltinted and neutralsouled
 And all of life seemed a story told
 And the only spot that was bright to see
 Was a patch of green that had bloomed for me
 Where a garden lived in a spring long fled
 When Love stood smiling
 BUT LOVE WAS DEAD




TO A CERTAIN ROOM

 Your room is still the dainty little place
 That used to seem so much a part of you
 The draperies of faded rose and blue
 Still hold a shadow of their former grace
 The windows still are hung with frosty lace
 And sometimes when the moonlight glimmers
 through
 I watch your mirror half expecting to
 See once again reflected there your face

 And yet the little room seems much too neat
 It seems quite colorless and very bare
 Because the filmy things you used to wear
 Are laid away Because the perfume sweet
 That clung about you has been swept aside
 Your room is therebut oh its soul has died




OTHER DAYS

 I wonder if you ever dream of other days
 Because sometimes at twilight when the sunset
 plays
 Half wistfully across the polished oaken floor
 I see you smilingstanding in your place once more

 Do you remember little things we used to say
 They wouldnt mean so very much to us today
 Do you remember how I wore a gown of blue
 Because it brought the haze of autumn clouds to you
 Do you remember how I said you didnt care
 And how you laughed at me and rumpled up my
 hair
 Do you remember how the tears stood in my eyes
 At your goodby when darkness overhung the skies

 I wonder if you ever dream of other days
 Because sometimes at twilight when the sunset plays
 Half wistfully across your empty cozychair
 I turn and half expect to see you smiling there


 THIS IS TO YOU DEAR
 TO YOU UNKNOWING
 JUST AS THE SOUTH WIND
 WISTFULLY BLOWING
 TOUCHES SOME FLOWER

 SO IS MY SONG DEAR
 THROUGH EVERY HOUR
 ALL THE DAY LONG DEAR
 TO YOU UNKNOWING




AT TWILIGHT

 You came to me through the candlelight
 When the world outside was grey
 You came to me through the candlelight
 When the day was done and the misty night
 Crept through the land
 And your eyes were bright
 And they seemed to laugh and pray
 You came to me through the candlelight
 And you took my hands and you held them tight
 And you didnt speak but dear I KNEW
 And my heart and my soul were part of you

 You came to me through the candlelight
 When the world outside was grey
 And I looked in your eyes and glowing there
 I saw a hope and I read a prayer
 And I knew at last that I didnt care
 If life were a troubled weary way
 As long as I walked with you
 You came to me at the close of day
 Through the candlelightwhen the world was grey
 And dreams of Heaven seemed strangely new
 And I told you dear to stay





THERE ARE SUCH WEARY LITTLE LINES

 There are such weary little lines about the mouth of
 you
 Such tragic little mirthless linesthey mock at
 dreams come true
 And twist your lips when you would smile until all
 joy is dead
 And I who want to laugh with you am fain to
 weep instead

 There are such dreary little lines about the mouth of
 you
 They make me want to whisper that summer sky is
 blue
 And that the rain is like a lance of silver through
 the air
 And that the flowers in the lane are growing tall
 and fair

 There are such tired little lines about the mouth of
 you
 As if you thought that life was cold and loving
 friends were few
 They are such lonely little lines I think that I some
 day
 Will creep close to you in the dusk and kiss them
 quite away





THREE SONGS OF AWAKENING

 1

 The flowers spring from the broken heart
 Of the frozen winter sod
 Rending their prison bars apart
 They smile in the face of God

 The birds sweep up to the windblown plain
 Eer ever the land knows spring
 To sway on a budding branch again
 To challenge the world and sing

 And I with my tired eyes adance
 And my weary heart aflame
 Have felt the call of the old romance
 And thrilled to a whispered name

 2

 I saw a sky as blue as eyes I know
 I felt a breeze as soft as kisses blow
 And dear I saw one golden sunbeam creep
 From Heaven lighting all the world below
 Like love that wakens dewyeyed from sleep

 3

 We who have wondered know the answer now
 For Spring stands joyous on the purple brow
 Of the far hill and doubt is swept away
 And all the mirthmad world makes holiday

 We who have wandered long and half afraid
 Find answer in each dreaming woodland glade
 HEARTS THAT HAVE BROKEN MAY BE BOUND TOGETHER
 WHEN SPRING HAS TRIUMPHED OVER WINTER WEATHER




IN A CANOE

 Starlight and the silver lake
 Clasp the skies
 And two nearer dearer stars
 Your eyes

 Elfin voices seem to call
 Through the night
 But your arms are warm and they
 Hold me tight

 Pallidly the moon slides down
 Hour by hour slips
 Ah the deathless magic of
 Your lips

 Dark the shadows as we creep
 Past the shore
 Dear that we might drift like this
 Evermore





CAPTIVEHEART

 Now that the day is done I am ready to greet you
 Smiling the way that I know you would have me
 smile
 I will open the door and will run down the walk
 to meet you
 As if I had missed you dear for a weary while
 I will listen breathless the while you tell of your
 toiling
 All day long in the dust and the citys heat
 And dear you will never know that my blood is
 boiling
 Back of the smile that is calm and tenderly sweet

 You will never know that the soul of me dear is
 flying
 Out where the seagull dips in the oceans foam
 You will never know that something of me is dying
 Every night as I smile and welcome you home
 You will never know that my heart is soaring above
 you
 You will be content with my mask of a smile
 KNOWING I LOVE YOU




EVENING SONG

 I do not want to be worshipped
 From a distance
 Like some idol carved in wood
 Or stone
 I want to be loved
 As every real woman
 Wants to be loved

 And so
 Lay aside the book that you are reading from
 What if Leander did swim the Hellespont
 And what if burning Sappho
 Did sing
 What do I care for
 Launcelot and Elaine
 Or Tristram and Isolt
 Or Aucassin and Nicholette

 Lay aside the book that you are reading from
 And cross the room quickly
 And take my cold hands between your two
 Warmer ones
 And here in the vivid dusk
 We will make our own love songs





AFTER A DAY OF WAITING

 All day long I waitedwaited with soul aflame
 And then through the still of evening humming a
 tune you came
 Came with a jest on your smiling lips and eyes that
 were all too gay
 And the light died out of my waiting heart with the
 words that I could not say

 We laughed through the starflecked twilightwhat
 though my laugh was strained
 You who were there beside me laughed with a mirth
 unfeigned
 And at last when I bade you leave me you went and
 you never knew
 That with soul aflame I had waited all through the
 day for you





INTANGIBLE

 Dear you are like the summer dusk to me
 The summer dusk when all the world seems still
 When purple shadows creep along the hill
 And birds are softly crooning in each tree
 You are the gentlecooleyed mystery
 Of twilight hours Sometime I think you will
 Melt from me out into the dark until
 You turn to starshine silvering the sea

 Dear even when your head is on my breast
 You seem no nearer than a moonbeam thrown
 Across my heart Your fingers have caressed
 My hair so lightly that I scarce have known
 Their pressure You are like that time when rest
 Steals up so softly that one feels alone





AT FIRST SIGHT

 Seeing you once how can I forget
 That our eyes have smiled and our hands have met
 That our souls have known and our hearts have cried
 Though our lips were dumb
 Ah the world is wide
 And love there is for us both to know
 But my eyes were dim as I watched you go

 You may wander far you may come no more
 But you hold the key to the inmost door
 Of my heart of hearts
 For our hands have met
 And our eyes have smiled and I CANT FORGET




FIVE SONNETS

 I THE COMING

 I know that Love will come to me some day
 Though I have never loved or looked on Love
 I know that Love will wait beside the way
 And smile at me The tender skies above
 Will be alight with all the joy of spring
 And flowers will life their heads above the earth
 And some far bird will stay its flight and sing
 And fill the land with silver throated mirth

 I know that Love at last with smiling eyes
 Will pause beside my halfswung cottage door
 And I will lift my gaze without surprise
 To see his shadow dance across the floor
 I know that Love will come to me some day
 When springtime blossoms shyly into May


 II REALIZATION

 I know that you are not the one that I
 Should fall in love with for your eyes are blind
 To all the things that make my world the kind
 I want to live in Often when I cry
 At some vague beauty that has caught my eye
 You laugh You cannot dream the dreams I find
 In forest places where dim pathways wind
 Up to the Heavenland so far and high

 I know that I should never learn to care
 And yet sometimes the blueness of your eyes
 Can make me half forget the smiling skies
 And when I see the sunlight on your hair
 I do not stop to reason dear for oh
 My heart throbs faster and I knowI know




III THE RAIN OUTSIDE

 You close beside me and outside the rain
 Which stealing through the darkness of the night
 Seems tapping out with fingers softly light
 A worldold song upon my window pane
 A song of happiness with a refrain
 That throbs in suffering You hold me tight
 Your eyes that search my own are warmly bright
 Your lips touch mine again and yet again

 Ah what though years must pass though you and I
 May live our lives quite silently apart
 Whenever rain comes when the day is through
 And tapping on my casement seems to sigh
 A dream will blossom fragrant in my heart
 A dream of youth eternal and ofyou




IV I USED TO WRITE

 I used to write so many songs of love
 I wrote them carefully I did not know
 That love was more than moonlight from above
 And pretty words set in an even row
 I held my pencil calmly in my hand
 And sang of arms and lips and tender eyes
 I wrote of lovewho did not understand
 And hoped that folk would think me very wise

 I used to write so many songs Today
 My hands are folded and I cannot sing
 I sit instead and watch the sunlight stray
 Across my desk And I am wondering
 If God who lights a million stars each night
 Laughed at the groping words I tried to write




V MOONGLOW

 I wonder if dim centuries ago
 We watched the moon together on some night
 When stars hung very near and softly bright
 I wonder if my tired head drooped low
 Against your breast And if you seemed to know
 As you know now the dreams that like a light
 Shone in my soul For dear it seems so right
 So very right that you should hold me so

 Here in the moonlight there is nothing new
 The very arms that crush me to your heart
 Seem almost like a memory a part
 Of some vague yesterday that has come true
 I feel tonight as if I dear might start
 A journey back across the years with you




FORGIVEN

 You left me when the weary weight of sorrow
 Lay like a stone upon my bursting heart
 It seemed as if no shimmering tomorrow
 Could dry the tears that you had caused to start
 You left me never telling why you wandered
 Without a word without a last caress
 Left me with but the love that I had squandered
 The husks of love and a vast loneliness

 And yet if you came back with arms stretched toward
 me
 Came back tonight with carefree smiling eyes
 And said My journeying has somehow bored me
 And love though broken never never dies
 I would forget the wounded heart you gave me
 I would forget the bruises on my soul
 My oldtime gods would rise again to save me
 My dreams would grow supremely new and whole
 What though youth lay a tattered garment oer you
 Warm words would leap upon my lips long dumb
 If you came back with arms stretched out before
 you
 AND TOLD ME DEAR THAT YOU WERE GLAD TO COME




THE WRITING

 Sometimes a mist of sunlight across a strangers hair
 Sometimes the vague expression upon a strangers
 face
 Can make me feel your presencecan fill a lonely
 place
 With dreams of life half realized Faint music
 through the air
 Can make me hear your footfall again upon the
 stair
 Sometimes a dancer moving with quite unconscious
 grace
 Can make my pulse beat faster and for a breathless
 space
 Can make me turn expecting to find you standing
 there

 You have not gone The passing of every empty
 day
 Has only brought you nearer Those things that
 were a part
 Of all we planned together are bits of you that stay
 To bruise my soul as sharply as any flametipped
 dart
 Ah time may hold its healingbut years that pass
 away
 Cannot erase the writing you traced upon my
 heart





AT PARTING

 Love of my life the time has come for parting
 For dearest I must leave you while we care
 Leave you while tears of vain regret are starting
 While I can look at you and find you fair
 Could we endure a morn of bitter waking
 Could we accept a love that would seem less
 Dear I must go the while my heart is breaking
 Go while my world is filled with happiness

 Love of my soul our dream has been so flaming
 That if we waited it might smoulder down
 Leaving dead ashes only ashes shaming
 All that was vividashes dimly brown
 We will have memories as sweet as flowers
 We who have left untouched Fates cup of woe
 Kiss me once more to bridge lifes aching hours
 Love of my heartthe time has come to go



 WHEN I AM OLD

 When I am old and drenched in worlds of sadness
 And wear a lacy cap upon my head
 When looking past the futures singing gladness
 I linger wistful in the years long dead
 When I am old and young folk all about me
 Speak softly of religion WHEN THEY SPEAK
 When parties are a grand success without me
 And when my laugh is fluttering and weak

 Will I then be content to raise my glances
 Serenely to the cloudentangled sky
 And will I be content to watch at dances
 Without a heartbreak as the hours pass by
 Or when I see young lovers fingers twine
 WILL I REMEMBER DEAR YOUR LIPS ON MINE




THE REFUGE

 We hurried once down the purple road
 When a storm hung low in the sky
 And we gained the door of Loves abode
 As the silver rain flashed by
 Our steps rang out as we crossed the sill
 And the place was dimly bright
 And even our hearts seemed strangely still
 While our searching hands clasped tight

 We waited there while the wind moaned past
 And the thunder crashed in the air
 And the door of Loves abode blew fast
 But we didnt knowor care
 For we heard a song in the driving rain
 And the sky seemed warmly gray
 And the tempest rang with a mad refrain
 And the world seemed years away
         

 We have wandered far from the road of dreams
 We have crept from the house of love
 And the scorching sun of the noonday gleams
 From the pitiless sky above
 But once ah oncein that dusky place
 When the lightning flashed through the air
 I saw its flame on your upturned face
 And its glow on your vivid hair

 We have strayed awaywe have strayed away
 For the world is all too wide
 But once I came through the stormy day
 And you walked proud at my side
 AND OH FOR THE FEEL OF THE RAIN AGAIN
 AND OH FOR THE PURPLE ROAD
 AND OH FOR THE JOY AND THE PAIN AGAIN
 THAT WE KNEW IN LOVES ABODE




TO DREAM ALONE

 How long the days may seem how long each night
 And yet how short the evenings used to be
 How strange it is that I can never see
 Warm pictures in the hearth that glows so bright
 We used to watch the laughing firelight
 And build dream castles in itAh but we
 Built castles everywhere And now the sea
 Is swept between us You have gone to fight

 And II wait and try to dream alone
 And try to smile to dance and laugh and sing
 And somehow cannot think of anything
 But just the thrilling roughness of your tone
 The light that lights your eyes your lips that
 cling
 And lovethe flame of love that we have known




NOW I MAY SING OF SADNESS

 Knowing dear that my whole heart lies at rest
 Deep in the heart of you I may sing a song
 Telling the tale of bitterness and wrong
 Knowing dear that my head lay on your breast
 Only last night I may sing of dreams that died
 And hopes that never were born and faith betrayed
 Of weary feet that have left the road and strayed
 Out of the narrow way to pastures wide

 Dear when my songs were gay I did not know
 Whether you cared And so I had to sing
 Gladly to mask grim fearI had to bring
 Sunlight to point the path that I must go
 Now that the clouds are silver sweet above
 I may sing songs of sadness I am blessed
 Knowing dear that my whole heart lies at rest
 Knowing dear that I have your loveyour love




KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE WALKED HER MUDDY ROADS
 WEARILY AFTER BITTER TIMES OF FIGHTING
 KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE CARRIED HEAVY LOADS
 OVER HER HILLSWHILE I AT HOME WAS LIGHTING
 DIM YELLOW CANDLES ON THE MANTEL SHELF
 KNOWING YOU SUFFERED AGONY AND LOSS
 UNDER THE VERY SHADOW OF A CROSS
 FRANCE HOLDS A BIT OF YOUAND OF MYSELF




WHEN WAR CAME

 War came one day and drew us close together
 Although it swept us many miles apart
 The love that lay as lightly as a feather
 Now rests a precious weight upon my heart
 And all the dreams I dreamed for just the dreaming
 Have taken on a meaning that is new
 And somehow all the lonely world is seeming
 To cry aloud my aching need of you

 Because you were so much a part of living
 Like sunshine and the freshness of the air
 The priceless gift of faith that you were giving
 Seemed small to me Scarce knowing you were
 there
 I took your heartstrings in my careless fingers
 And played a song as light as summer dew
 And yet today its wistful echo lingers
 And fills an empty world with thoughts of you

 I did not think that I would ever miss you
 I did not dream the time would come to be
 When I would long to touch your hand to kiss you
 To hear your voice say tender words to me
 I did not know that I would wonder whether
 My head would rest once more against your
 heart
 War came my dear and drew us close together
 Although it swept us many miles apart





WHEN YOU WENT BY

 I stood in the rain and watched you pass
 I stood in the blinding rain
 And I thought of a fragrant summer night
 When the room was glowing with candlelight
 And a shower beat on the window glass
 With a wonderful low refrain
 I thought of your arms that held me tight
 And your eyes that were near and warmly bright
 I thought ofall as I watched you pass
 And my soul was wrung with pain

 Tramp tramp tramp rang your columns tread
 Tramp tramp tramp through the street
 Ah dear it was summer once and there
 Were flower scents on the misty air
 Honeysuckle and mignonette poignantly sadly
 sweet
 Tramp tramp tramp rang your columns tread
 And my eyes were dim as I bowed my head
 And my heart seemed broken and old and dead
 Under your marching feet

 I stood in the rain and watched you pass
 There in the autumn rain
 And I thought my dear of the night when you
 Had kissed me first Ah your eyes were blue
 And very tender and Heaventrue
 There in the candlelight
 I thought of a misty summer night
 When a shower fell on the vivid grass
 There through the rain I watched you pass
 I thought of a mystic summer night
 That never may come again

 TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP RANG YOUR COLUMNS TREAD
 TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP IN THE STREET
 AND I TRIED TO SMILEWITH A LIFTED HEAD
 BUT MY HEART LAY CRUSHED AT YOUR FEET




IN MEMORIAM

 To an American Aviator

 He went to battle in the misthung sky
 Like some goldhearted bird with pinions strong
 He went with courage with a snatch of song
 In all his splendid youth And God on high
 Looked down with love to watch him dip and fly
 Then lifted him to where the brave belong
 He went to right a bleeding nations wrong
 And proved that he was not afraid to die

 So we who stare across the lonely hours
 Must only think of that great gift he gave
 Must think of other lives that his will save
 And know that when the tender healing showers
 Have fallen in a strangerland the flowers
 Will bloom like prayers upon a heros grave



 A PEASANT GIRL SINGS

 Somewhere Out There he isjust a boy thats all
 Laughter sparkled in his eyeshe was always
 singing
 Just a boy who answered when he heard his countrys
 call
 Somewhere Out There he ishow my thoughts go
 winging
 Ready to do or dare
 Like sunlight was his hair
 Just a boy a laughing boy
 Somewhere Out There

 Idle my wheel today hushed is its spinning
 Ah but his eyes were blueblue as the sea
 Somewhere Out There he is Losingor winning
 Boy with the carefree heart come back to me
 Blood red the cannons flare
 God can you hear my prayer
 Keep him my boy from harm
 Somewhere Out There





TOGETHER

 THEY LAY TOGETHER IN THE SUN AND WAITED FOR THE END
 SIDE BY SIDE TOGETHER BEARDED FOE AND FRIEND
 JEAN FROM THE PLEASANT FIELDS OF SINGING SOUTHERN
 FRANCE
 JEAN FROM THE POPPY FIELDS SIGHING WITH ROMANCE

 FRITZ WHOSE SOFTNOSED BULLETS HAD NEVER FLINCHED NOR
 SWERVED
 AND PETER WHOSE TIRED EYES WERE WIDE AND DEEP AND
 BROWN
 PETER FROM DELANCEY STREET IN NEW YORK TOWN

 They didnt speak these three
 They didnt know each others tongue
 And then
 When men
 Whose songs are nearly sung
 Are lying side by side
 Their breathing not so free
 The gulf is rather wide

 In the sun they lay there
 And Fritzs hair
 Was very bright
 He was a foe
 To kill on sight
 And yet the light
 Upon his hair was so
 So very fair


 Jean found himself remembering HER hair
 Of palest gold it was a magic snare
 To net mens soul in She had bade him go
 Sobbing Je taimewhich means I love you so
 Her hairher handsher lips
 Red as a sunset cloud when daytime slips
 Into the night No redder
 Like a flower
 That blooms upon the earth for just an hour
 A poppy flower fragile soft HER LIPS
 Red as the heartblood of a man that drips
 Into eternity
 Jean sighed
 And died

 PERHAPS HER LIPS WERE VERY NEARWHO KNOWS
 WHEN EYES MUST CLOSE
 AGAINST THE SUN AND LIFE WHO CARES
 ONE ONLY DARES
 TO WONDER

 Fritz lay still
 He felt the strength the faith the stubborn will
 Drop from him like worn garments till he lay
 Halffrightened in the burning light of day
 He had killed many yes
 From under
 His tunic gropingly he drew a cross
 He wondered would it make for her the loss
 A little less
 Ah to press
 His bearded lips once more upon her cheek
 To hear her speak

 Yes he had killed and killed
 And he had thrilled
 To do it
 But just to sit
 Beside her in the shade
 THAT had been paradise
 Her soft arms laid
 About his throat
 THEY STRANGLED HIM
 His eyes grew dim
 He chokedonce twice

 Peter from Delancey Street laughed with white
 lipped pluck
 Dyin side o HIM he coughed Aint it rotten
 luck
 Poor guy they got him thoughgot him same as
 me
 Peter from Delancey Street stopped talking suddenly

 He saw
 A candy store
 On the busy smelly corner of a crowded city
 slum
 He heard the hum
 Of traffic in the street
 The sound of feet
 Upon the pavement and he saw
 Behind the counter there
 THE GIRL She wore
 Her hair
 Plastered tight to her little shelllike ears
 He felt her tears
 Upon his face
 The night he told her that hed left his place
 His steady paying job to go and fight

 Good night
 Hed said to her
 Somebodys gotta go
 Yerself you know
 We gotta STIR
 Tlick them fellers Over There
 Her slickedback hair
 Had roughened up against his khaki sleeve
 And she had cried
 Dear MUST you leave
 And he had dried
 Her eyes and smudged the powder on her
 nose

 Here goes
 Said Peter of Delancey Street
 He saw
 A candy store
 A city slum a girl with plastered hair
 Who waited there

 THEY LAY TOGETHER IN THE SUNBRAVELY TO THE END

JIMDOG

 He wasnt well a fancy kind o dog
 Not Jim
 But oh I sorter couldnt seem ter help
 Alovin him
 He always seemed ter understand
 Hed rub his nose against my hand
 If I was feelin blue or sad
 Or if my thoughts was pretty bad
 An how hed bark an frisk an play
 When I was gay

 A soldiers dog dont have much time ter whine
 Like little pets ahowlin at th moon
 A soldiers dog is bound ter learn right soon
 That war is war an what a steady line
 Of men in khaki means
 What dogs dont know
 You bet they do Jimdog he had ter go
 Along th trenches oftentimes at night
 He seemed ter sense it when there was a fight
 Abrewin Oh I guess he knew all right
 I was a soldier an Jimdog was MINE

 Ah whats the use
 There never was another dog like him
 Why on th march Id pause an callHey Jim
 An hed be there his head tipped on one side
 Alookin up at me with love an pride
 His tail awaggin an his ears raised high

 I wonder why my Jimdog had ter die
 He was a friend ter folks he didnt bite
 He never snapped at no one in th night
 He didnt hate a soul an he was GAME
 An yet a spark o light a dartin flame
 Across th dark a sneaky bit o lead
 An he was dead

 They say there aint no heavenland for him
 Cause dogs is dogs an havent any right
 But let me tell yer this without my Jim
 Th very shinin streets would seem less bright
 An somehow Im athinkin that if he
 Could come at that last stirrin bugle call
 Up to th gates o gold aside of me
 Where God stands smilin welcome to us all
 An I said Father heres my dog heres
 Jim
 Theyd find some corner touched with love fer him





SIX SONNETS

 I SOMEHOW

 Somehow I never thought that you would go
 Not even when red war swept through the land
 I somehow thought because I loved you so
 That you would stay I did not understand
 That something stronger than my love could come
 To draw you halfreluctant from my heart
 I never thought the call of fife and drum
 Would rend our cloak of happiness apart

 And yet you went And II did not weep
 I smiled instead and brushed the tears aside
 And yet when nighttime comes I cannot sleep
 But silent lie while longing fights with pride
 YOU ARE MY MAN THE FOE YOU FIGHT MY FOE
 AND YETI NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD GO


 II I WONDER

 I wonder if you dream across the night
 When watchfires cut the vivid dark in twain
 Of long dim rooms and yellow candlelight
 And gardens drenched in vaguely perfumed rain
 I wonder if you think when shot and shell
 And molten fire are singing songs of hate
 Of that last throbbing moment of farewell
 When in your arms I promised you to wait

 I wonder should grim death reach out his hand
 And speak above the strife of peace and rest
 If you alone in that dark stranger land
 Would feel again my head upon your breast
 And if as light and love and living slips
 Your prayer would be my kiss upon your lips


 III SOME DAY

 Some day when on exultant feet you come
 Back through the streets that echo at your tread
 My soul will thrill to hear the throbbing drum
 And yet perhaps Ill sit with drooping head
 Not caring quite to meet your steady gaze
 Not daring quite to look into your eyes
 Afraid because a weary stretch of days
 Each one a million years between us lies

 My heartmy heart is ever yours to hold
 And yet while I have waited here for you
 You have seen faith betrayed and brave youth sold
 You have seen meadows drenched in bloody dew
 It may have changed you and your eyes may be
 A little harder when they look at me


 IV DREAM

 Sometimes I dream that you are back with me
 And that with hands together clasped we go
 Like little children young and glad and free
 Adown a magic road we used to know
 Sometimes I dream your eyes upon my face
 And feel your fingers softly touch my hair
 And when I wake from dreaming all the place
 Seems lonelier because you are not there

 What is a dream Not very much they say
 An idle vision made in castled Spain
 Well maybe they are right And yet today
 When all the warring world was swept with pain
 The suffering and sorrow ceased to be
 Because I dreamed that you were back with me


 V UNDERSTANDING

 Now when I stand in some great crowded place
 I see the souls of other women stare
 Out of their eyesAnd I can glimpse the care
 And worry that has banished light and grace
 From every life Upon each womanface
 I see the mark of tears the hint of prayer
 That one short year ago had not been there
 I see what time will never quite erase

 Before you left I did not notice eyes
 Because I knew that I might touch your hand
 I did not dream the dread that swept our land
 Ah dear the months have made me very wise
 Now one with everything I understand
 And heart meets heart and I can sympathize


 VI THE WAKING

 Now war is over and a world set free
 And youth returns triumphant to our land
 And dearheart youll be coming back to me
 With eager lips and tender outstretched hand
 You will be coming as you came of old
 At evening time with laughter lilting gay
 Glad of the little things that life may hold
 And I will meet you in the self same way

 Yes in the shadows by my oaken door
 I will be waiting as I used to wait
 And I will feel that you are come before
 I hear the clicking of the garden gate
 And in the darkness there my pulse will leap
 Reviving dreams that long have lain asleep


 AFTER PEACE

 I wonder what theyre doin home tonight
 Jim said
 We sat there in the yellow firelight
 There in a house in France
 Some of us maybe thinkin of romance
 Some of us missin buddies who was dead
 And some just dreamin
 Sorter hardly seemin
 Ter make th dream come clear

 An thenJim spoke
 I wonder what theyre doin home ternight
 Says Jim
 An some of us felt wellas if wed like
 Ter smother him
 An some of us tried hardlike not ter choke
 Th smoke
 Was pretty thick an black
 Athinkin back
 Across th ocean I could sort of see
 A little house that means just all ter me
 And though nobody said a word I knew
 Their thoughts was goin on th selfsame track
 Thoughts do
 Out here in France

 HomeHOMENo wonder that we all was still
 For one of us was thinkin of a hill
 With pine trees on it black against th moon
 And one of us was dreaming of a town
 All drab an brown
 An one of us was lookinfar an high
 Ter some one who had gone back home too soon
 To that real home that is beyond the sky

 Nobody of us spoke fer quite a while
 We didnt smile
 We just sat still an wondered when thered be
 An order for ter send us home
 Back crost the sea
 Th war was won
 An we was DONE
 We wanted faces that we loved an knew
 An voices too

 We sat an watched th dancin fire fling
 Its shadders on th floor
 Bright shapes an dim
 An then Jim coughed as if his throat was sore
 AnSaylets sing
 Says Jim




FROM THE DECK OF A TRANSPORT

 A Returning Soldier Speaks

 I am coming back with a singing soul through the
 surge of the splendid sea
 Coming back to the land called home and the love
 that used to be
 I am coming back through a flash of spray through
 a conquered tempests hum
 I am coming back I am coming back But
 God do I want to come

 I have heard the shriek of the great shells speak to
 the dawn of a flaming day
 And a growling gun when the fight was won and the
 twilight flickered gray
 I have seen men die with their chins raised high and
 a curse that was half a prayer
 I have fought alone when a comrades groan was
 tense on the blinding air

 I have tramped a road when a burning load was
 strapped to my aching back
 Through miles of mud that was streaked with blood
 when my closing eyes turned back
 I have cried aloud to a heedless crowd of a God that
 they could not know
 And have knelt at night when the way was bright
 with a rockets sullen glow

 I am going home through the whirling foamhome
 to her arms stretched wide
 I am going back to the beaten track and the sheltered
 fireside
 With gasping breath I have sneered at death and
 have mocked at a shells swift shirr
 And safe again through the years of pain I am
 going backto HER




I am coming back with a singing soul through the
 surge of the splendid sea
 Coming backBUT MY SINGING SOUL WILL NEVER BE
 QUITE FREE
 For I have killed and my heart has thrilled to the
 call of the battle hum
 I am coming back to the usedtobeBut God do I
 want to come




TIMMY BUNKIE

 I met Tim th other day
 On Broadway
 Hadnt seem him since he fell
 Covered like with streaks of blood
 In th Argonnes battle hell

 Tim an me was bunkies we
 Marched together
 Through th water an th slime
 SUNNY FRANCE HEY We seen weather
 That we hadnt dreamed COULD be
 Anywhere or any time
 We had foughtwell hand to hand
 Over miles o broken land
 Through th Vesle an by th Aisne
 When th shrapnel fell like rain
 Tim an me was bunkiessee

 Smilin sort o cuss was Tim
 Never seen th beat o him
 He could whistle when a pack
 Was like lead upon his back
 He could smile with blistered feet
 Never swore at monkey meat
 Or at cooties or th drill
 Always laughinnever still
 That was Tim

 Say th fellers loved that boy
 Chaplain said that he was joy
 All incarnate Sounds all right
 But th men said he was WHITE
 That meant most to us Id say
 Why we never seen th day
 When he wouldnt help a guy
 If he had a franc hed buy
 Chocolate or chow for us
 Genrus little smilin cuss
 That was Tim

 When THEY got him I can see
 Even now th way he slipped
 To th ground beside o me
 Red blood dripped
 From his tunic an his chin
 But he choked out Fellers win
 Me I dont much matter GRIN

 Sure we had ter leave him lay
 War is always thataway
 An we thought ocourse hed die
 Maybe thats the reason why
 We could fight th way we did
 Why we found th guns THEY hid
 Why we broke their line in two
 Whistlin a tune HE knew
 All th time we pushed em back
 Crowdin on em whack fer whack

 I seen Tim th other day
 On Broadway
 He had lef one arm in France
 But his eyes was all adance
 When he seen me face t face
 Say he shouts aint this SOME place
 Aint it great th war is through
 Glad I seen it though aint you

 Smilin sort o little cuss
 Meetin me without a fuss
 Tim my bunkie livin Tim
 Thats him




A PRAYER FOR OUR BOYS RETURNING

 God bring them back just as they went away
 A little wiser maybe but unchanged
 In all the vital thingslet them today
 Take up the lives that war has disarranged
 Let them renew the youth they laid aside
 To fight their battles in the world of men
 God bring to life their little dreams that died
 And build their altars new again and then

 Give them the vivid youth that they have sought for
 Through bloody mists on bloody fields of strife
 Show them the gallant truth that they have fought
 for
 Show them anew the better things of life
 God of the hosts blot out the months of pain
 And let them have their boyhood back again
 AMEN





PARIS

 I AFTER PEACE

 The city thrills once more to joyous singing
 Glad laughter sounds again upon the street
 And music throbs again until young feet
 Trip merrily upon their way the ringing
 Of hour chimes are gallant voices flinging
 Their challenges through each crowded space to
 greet
 Old friends who linger where they used to meet
 With other friends long gone The summer
 bringing

 The light of peace has seemed to fill the city
 With happiness that echoes far and wide
 In sounds of joy there seems no room for sorrow
 Yet like a minor chord submersed in pity
 There steals above the music of tomorrow
 The weary footsteps of the ones who died





II THE RUE DE LA PAIXA STREET OF JEWELS

 The windows glow with many jewels with rubies
 fireentangled
 And glowing bits of emerald and diamonds like
 the dew
 But Paris can you quite forget the bodies lying
 mangled
 Beneath the snow on Flanders fieldsyour lost
 who call to you

 The windows of each little shop are gay with gem
 like laughter
 With rings to fit miladys hand and drops to deck
 her ear
 But Paris can you quite forget Verdun and Ypres
 andafter
 And far beneath the sounds of mirth one
 wonders what you hear

 The windows glow with countless jewels the shop
 girls stop to wonder
 The little shopgirls who are still so many dressed
 in black
 But oh the saddened hearts of them no doubt are
 lying under
 Some sandy stretch along the Marne where grim
 defeat turned back

 The windows gleam enticingly and eyes light up to
 see them
 For Paris thrills to loveliness as Paris always
 thrilled
 Oh God of beauty touch the lives that war has
 crushed and free them
 From broken dreams an empty faith and hopes
 forever stilled





III THE FLOWER WAGONS

 Violets and mignonette crowded close together
 Crowded close together on the corner of each street
 Through the chilling dampness of the misty weather
 Violets and mignonetteah so close together
 Making all the Paris day colorful and sweet

 Roses faintly touched with pink see a soldier
 lingers
 Close beside the flowerstand dreaming of the day
 When she broke a single bud with her slender fingers
 Pressed it to her wistful mouthsee a soldier lingers
 Dreaming of a summertime very far away

 Lilacs white and pure and new fragrant as the
 morning
 One pale widow passing by pauses for a space
 Thinking of the lilac tree that once grew adorning
 All a little cottage home in lifes fragrant morning
 Of a lilac tree that grew in a garden place

 Pansies for a thought of love lilies for loves sorrow
 Bay leaves green as hopes that live berries red
 and brown
 Flowers vivid for a day gone upon the morrow
 Flowers that are sweet as faith that are sad as
 sorrow
 Flowers for the weary souls of a weary town

 Violets and mignonette crowded close together
 Crowded close together on the corner of each
 street
 Singing of the summertime through the misty
 weather
 Violets and mignonetteah so close together
 Making all the Paris day colorful and sweet


 IV ACROSS THE YEARS

 Marie Antoinette walked down the steps of a certain
 Chapel on her way to the guillotine

 They say a queen once walked along the marble steps
 with grace
 To meet grim death by guillotinea smile was on
 her face
 A smile of scorn that lifted her above the howling
 crowd
 A smile that mocked at pallid feara smile serene
 and proud

 Yes it was Marie Antoinetteshe walked with
 steady tread
 She sauntered down the marble steps with proudly
 lifted head
 And there were those among the crowd who watched
 with indrawn breath
 To see a queen walk out with smiles to keep a tryst
 with death

 I stood beside those marble steps just yesterday and
 saw
 A bride upon a soldiers arma poilu brave who
 wore
 A Croix de Guerre upon his breastand oh they
 smiled above
 The busy throng that hurried by unconscious of their
 love

 And though across the mist of years I glimpsed a
 fair queens face
 A face that smiled but scornfully above her lands
 disgrace
 I will remember on those steps the little newmade
 wife
 Who came her eyes all filled with trust to keep
 her tryst with life


 V SUNLIGHT

 The sun shines over Paris fitfully
 As if it really were afraid to shine
 And clouds of gray mist curl and twist and twine
 Across the sky As far as one can see
 The streets are wet with rain and suddenly
 New rain falls in a straight relentless line
 And silver drops like needles slim and fine
 Drip from the branches of each gauntlimbed tree

 Ah Paris can the very wistful sky
 Look down into the center of your heart
 That has been bruised by war and torn apart
 The once glad heart that has been taught to sigh
 The sun is like your smile that flutters by
 Like some lost dream before the teardrops start


 VI THE LATIN QUARTERAFTER

 They were the brave ones the gallant ones the
 laughing ones
 Who were the very first to goto heed their coun
 trys call
 They were the joyous ones the carefree ones the
 chaffing ones
 Who were the first to meet the foe who were the
 first to fall

 Artists and poets they the talented and youthful
 ones
 All the world before their feet their feet that loved
 to stray
 We have heard about their lives stories crude and
 truthful ones
 Of the carefree lives they lived in the yesterday

 Ah the Latin Quarter now boarded up the most
 of it
 Studios are bare this year and little models sigh
 For the ones who died for France died and are the
 boast of it
 Died as they had always lived with their heads
 held high

 But a spark of it remains in forgotten places
 For I saw a blinded boy strumming a guitar
 Playing with his face asmile with the arts and
 graces
 Of a troubadour of old He had wandered far

 Through the flaming hell of warwandered far and
 home again
 To the corner that he loved when his eyes could
 see
 And he played a jolly tune he who may not roam
 again
 Played it on an old guitarplayed it smilingly

 And I saw another sit at a tiny table
 In a dingy eating house he had laughed and
 drawn
 Sketches on the ragged cloth boasting he was able
 Still to draw as well as mostwith two fingers
 gone


 VII NOTRE DAME

 Through colored glass on burnished walls
 Soft as a psalm the sunlight falls
 And in the corners cool and dim
 Its glow is like a vesper hymn
 And arch by arch the ceilings high
 Rise like a hand stretched toward the sky
 To touch Gods hand On every side
 Is misty silence and the wide
 Untroubled spaces seem to tell
 That Peace is comeand all is well

 A slender woman kneels in prayer
 The sunlight slants across her hair
 A pallid child in rusty black
 Stands in the doorway looking back
 A poilu gropes his eyes are wide
 Along the altar rail The tide
 Of war has cast him brokenly
 Upon the shore of life I see
 A girl in costly furs who cries
 Against her muff I see her rise
 And hurry out Two tourists pause
 Beside the grated chancel doors
 To wonder and to speculate
 To stoop and read a carven date

 In uniform the nations come
 Their voices are a steady hum
 Until they feel some subtle thrill
 That makes them falter holds them still
 Bronzed boys who shrugged and laughed at death
 They stand today with indrawn breath
 Half mystified
 The colors steal
 Into my heart and I can feel
 The rapture that the artists knew
 Who centuries before me drew
 Their very souls into the glass
 Of every window Hours pass
 Like beads of amber that are strung
 Upon a rainbow frail and young

 Through mellow glass on hallowed walls
 The twilight like faint music falls
 And in each corner cool and dim
 The music is a splendid hymn
 And arch on arch the ceilings high
 Seem like a hand stretched toward the sky
 To touch a Hand that clasped a Cross
 FOR FRANCE NEWRISEN FROM THE LOSS
 AND PAIN AND FEAR OF BATTLEHELL
 KNOWS PEACE AT LEAST AND ALL IS WELL


 VIII SUNDAY MORNING

 The streets are silent and the church bells ring
 Across the city like the silver chime
 Of some forgotten memory They bring
 The phantom of another sweeter time
 When war was all undreamed They seem to say
 Come back come back across the years of strife
 To One who reaches out a Hand today
 A Hand that brings your dead again to life

 A little whitehaired woman hurries past
 A tiny prayerbook in one wrinkled hand
 Her eyes are calm as one who knows at last
 What only age may really understand
 That as a rainbow creeps across the rain
 The God of Paris smiles above its pain





SONGS FROM FRANCE

 SCARS

 Summer sweeps like sad laughter over France
 Touching the fields with flowertinted mirth
 Bringing its wistful gladness to an earth
 That has been stabbed with sorrows bitter lance
 Bringing again the hint of old romance
 Bringing again the magic of rebirth
 Paying again the price that youth was worth
 OVER DIM WAYSIDE MOUNDS THE GRASSES DANCE

 Where there were shell holes summer sends un
 heeding
 Blossoms to deck the broken country side
 Where in another season heroes bleeding
 Fell for the cause of righteousness and died
 Green creeper twines its vivid arms halfpleading
 But there are scars that summer cannot hide




FROM PARIS TO CHATEAU THIERRY

 The road winds out its weary way
 Where fields are torn with sorrow
 It is a road of yesterday
 That dreams no fair tomorrow

 It is silent saddened road
 A lonely road to follow
 For in its dust red rivers flowed
 And now from every hollow
 The crows rise up in sullen flight
 The crows that blackly flying
 Against the skyline speak of night
 And bitterness and dying

 It is a road that creeps around
 Farmhouses that lie broken
 That pauses at each shallow mound
 At every bloodstained token
 A helmet by the way one sees
 A pistol bent and rusty
 And hung between two shattered trees
 A coat mildewed and musty
 It is a sad forgotten road
 But oh it tells the story
 Of youth that bore anothers load
 Without a thought of glory
 For every tattered homestead cries
 Of vengeance that descended
 And memory that never dies
 From hearts that stay unmended

 The road winds out its weary way
 A lonely way to follow
 And crows rise black against the day
 From every tree and hollow





A RUINED CHURCH

 They could not take the living God away
 Although they left His altar blank and bare
 Their ruthless hands could never rend and tear
 More than the walls they could not hope to sway
 The utter faith that is the nations heart
 They could not bring a real destruction where
 Hymn music had been softly wont to play
 They smothered beauty and tore hope apart
 But in the house of One who is supreme
 The marks they left will now be sanctified
 The broken walls when war is but a dream
 Will be a monument to those who died
 And every shelltorn scar will stand for One
 Whose hands were scarred the Christ men crucified

 I think perhaps the very morning sun
 Will slant more gently through the broken tower
 And in good season that some tender flower
 Will bloom beside the ruined threshold where
 Folk paused before they entered in to prayer





CHILD FACES

 Child faces saddened older than they should be
 And wiser than a livedout span of years
 One wonders what those self same faces would be
 If they had never looked on painif tears
 Had never been their portion if the morrow
 Had never held the pallid ghost of care
 Child faces graven deep with worlds of sorrow
 Until the light of childhood is not there

 Child faces once agleam with carefree laughter
 Wide eyes where smiles like baby rainbows grew
 They are the heritage of ever after
 They are the dreams that never will come true
 They are the words of fate that have been spoken
 And when the tumult of the war is gone
 They will remind a world that hearts were broken
 For in their souls France goes to meet her dawn





AFTER HEARING MUSIC COMING FROM A
 DEVASTATED FARMHOUSE

 Just a little wisp of song played softly in the twilight
 Such a happy little songand oh the dusk is gray
 Such a joyous little song and oh the night is
 coming
 Coming with the bitter chill that marks the death
 of day

 Almost like a dance it is it holds no hint of sorrow
 Almost like a waltz it is to set the pulse athrill
 Not a hint of tears in itand oh the night is
 coming
 Coming like a purple shroud across the purple hill
 Sad the little farmhouse is the doors swing on their
 hinges
 All the windows look like wounds pitiful and bare
 And a shell has torn a gash in the broken roof of it
 But the music lilts along like a happy prayer

 Do pale ghostly fingers play on a ghostly violin
 War has swept the countryside of the songs it
 knew
 Merry is the little tunenot a wistful questioning
 Merry with a rosy thrill of a dream come true

 Just a little wisp of song played softly in the twilight
 Such a happy little songand oh the dusk is gray
 Such a joyous little song and oh the night is
 coming
 Coming with the bitter chill that marks the death
 of day





RETURN

 Now that the tumult of the war is over
 The fairy folk are coming back to France
 They push their way through tangled grass and
 clover
 To find the ring where once they used to dance
 They come halfwistfully the little people
 Through broken town and battered market place
 They come past shelltorn church with shattered
 steeple
 They come as smiles come to a tearstained face

 They come with packs of dreams with love and
 laughter
 They come with songs rolled snugly up in sacks
 They come with promises for ever after
 Tied neatly into bundles on their backs
 They bring the seeds of magic so that flowers
 The flowers of new happiness and mirth
 May bloom once more in sweet enchanted bowers
 Above the heartache of a tortured earth

 Now that the angry powder smoke has vanished
 The fairy folk are coming as of yore
 The fairy folk that hate and war had banished
 They pause beside a loosely swinging door
 To set it right on hinges that were breaking
 They lift an old rag doll with tender care
 And hurry onbecause their hearts are aching
 For onetime childish faces that were there

 They cross forgotten meadows in the gloaming
 Through forest aisles at eventime they creep
 Where trenches were their little feet are roaming
 And where the heroes of the conflict sleep
 They stop a moment wistfuland their singing
 Dies down into the semblance of a prayer
 And tiny bells in faroff elf land ringing
 Sound like a silver promise on the air

 NOW THAT THE TUMULT OF THE WAR IS OVER
 ONCE MORE THE COUNTRY WAKENS TO ROMANCE
 FOR THROUGH THE TANGLE OF THE GRASS AND CLOVER
 THE FAIRY FOLK ARE COMING BACK TO FRANCE




THE PHOENIX

 The ruined wheat fields lying in the sun
 Will smile again eer many seasons pass
 The crooning breeze will sway the golden grass
 The way it did before a blazing gun
 Mowed down the meadow poppies in red heaps
 And battered villages will rise anew
 And homes will stand where onetime gardens grew
 And in dim forests where an army sleeps
 The little birds will sing their evening songs
 The way they did before a blasting rain
 Of shrapnel cut their tiny nests in twain
 For France will rise triumphant from her wrongs

 Yes France will rise once more in faith and pave
 Her roads anew with shattered stones of life
 Her songs will rise once more above the strife
 But what about the hearts that gaveand gave





A PRAYER ON EASTER FOR OUR BOYS
 KILLED IN ACTION

 Dear God they will not come again those lads of
 ours
 Who went to fight with honors foe across the sea
 Who died with eyes set straight ahead amid the
 showers
 Of shrapnel as they cleared a path to victory
 They will not come again And it is Easter
 weather
 And all the world is waking to the call of life
 But they lie sleeping Over There our lads together
 Who died before their hearts could know the end
 of strife

 Dear God they will not come again those lads of
 ours
 Who left this land so gallantly to do their best
 And so I ask that You will send gay springtime
 flowers
 To deck each shelltorn meadow where their bodies
 rest
 I ask that You will let them hear the joyous singing
 Of some deepthroated bird whose heart tones
 throb and swell
 God let them feel the thrill that Easter time is
 bringing
 That death is only life asleepand all is well
 AMEN





INDEPENDENCE DAY1919

 Over the mists of a century they come and their
 tramping feet
 Are light as the dust on the broad highway or the
 wind that sways in the wheat
 Out of the haze of the years between their shadowy
 hands stretch wide
 To welcome the heroes home again who have fought
 for their cause and died

 They went to battle at Concord Bridge and they fell
 on Bunker Hill
 The odds were great but they struggled on with a
 stubborn Yankee will
 They lay in the fields at Lexington when the sun in
 the west was red
 And the next years violets grew on the spot where
 their valiant blood was shed

 But they won in the endwith their broken guns
 and without much food to spare
 Won at the end of a bitter war by means that they
 knew were fair
 And some of them wandered back to their plows and
 some lay wrapped in the loam
 And slept the sleep of the fearless heart that has
 fought at homefor home

 Fought for their homes at home they didbut these
 other boys today
 Fought for the homes of stranger folk three thousand
 miles away
 FOUGHT FOR THE HONOR OF THE WORLD and were not
 afraid to die
 In a muddy trench in a foreign land and under a
 foreign sky

 They fought on the Marne at Belleau Wood they
 swept through the mad Argonne
 ChateauThierry was theirs to take they took it and
 then surged on
 And now that the fight they fought is won though
 they lie in a faroff grave
 Their souls come back to the land they lovedthe
 land that they LEFT to save

 And so through the damp of the sorry sea through
 the wreck of the shelltorn plain
 They are coming back to homes they lovedthey
 are coming back again
 And light as the wind that sways in the wheat or
 the dust on the broad highway
 They march to their rendezvous with the ones who
 died in the yesterday




SHADOWS

 You come to me at twilight when the others
 Are laughing in the fullness of their joy
 When gladeyed women folk when wives and mothers
 Are welcoming some other bronzecheeked boy
 You come to me all silent in the gloaming
 A shadow form with curly shadow hair
 And dear I somehow feel that you are roaming
 Between two shadow worldsthe Here and There

 They ask me do those others why I wander
 Down dewy lanes alone at eventide
 They do not know my hearts a shadowyonder
 They do not know that part of me has died
 They do not know that your dear presence stands
 Just out of reach with misty wideflung hands





LENVOI

 Only we two dear and the candlelight
 Seems to be softer than it was before
 Country and city vivid dream lands war
 Dear they are very far from us tonight

 Woven of promise from lifes golden loom
 Pale threads of light have bound us heart to heart
 Laughter and sorrowthey are things apart
 ALL OF OUR WORLD IS IN THIS LITTLE ROOM

 Outside the branches sway and winter weather
 Sweeps with a cry of triumph through the land
 Dear it is springtime when you touch my hand
 Only we two and magic here together
