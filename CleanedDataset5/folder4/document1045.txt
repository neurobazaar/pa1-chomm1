VENUS AND ADONIS

by William Shakespeare


 Villa miretur vulgus mihi flavus Apollo
 Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY

EARL OF SOUHAMPTON AND BARON OF TICHFIELD

RIGHT HONOURABLE

I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your
lordship nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a
prop to support so weak a burthen only if your honour seem but
pleased I account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of
all idle hours till I have honoured you with some graver labour But if
the first heir of my invention prove deformed I shall be sorry it had
so noble a godfather and never after ear so barren a land for fear it
yield me still so bad a harvest I leave it to your honourable survey
and your honour to your hearts content which I wish may always answer
your own wish and the worlds hopeful expectation

Your honours in all duty

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE





VENUS AND ADONIS


 EVEN as the sun with purplecolourd face
 Had taen his last leave of the weeping morn
 Rosecheekd Adonis tried him to the chase
 Hunting he lovd but love he laughd to scorn 4
 Sickthoughted Venus makes amain unto him
 And like a boldfacd suitor gins to woo him

 Thrice fairer than myself thus she began
 The fields chief flower sweet above compare 8
 Stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
 More white and red than doves or roses are
 Nature that made thee with herself at strife
 Saith that the world hath ending with thy life 12

 Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
 And rein his proud head to the saddlebow
 If thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
 A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know 16
 Here come and sit where never serpent hisses
 And being set Ill smother thee with kisses

 And yet not cloy thy lips with loathd satiety
 But rather famish them amid their plenty 20
 Making them red and pale with fresh variety
 Ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
 A summers day will seem an hour but short
 Being wasted in such timebeguiling sport 24

 With this she seizeth on his sweating palm
 The precedent of pith and livelihood
 And trembling in her passion calls it balm
 Earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good 28
 Being so enragd desire doth lend her force
 Courageously to pluck him from his horse

 Over one arm the lusty coursers rein
 Under her other was the tender boy 32
 Who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain
 With leaden appetite unapt to toy
 She red and hot as coals of glowing fire
 He red for shame but frosty in desire 36

 The studded bridle on a ragged bough
 Nimbly she fastensO how quick is love
 The steed is stalled up and even now
 To tie the rider she begins to prove 40
 Backward she pushd him as she would be thrust
 And governd him in strength though not in lust

 So soon was she along as he was down
 Each leaning on their elbows and their hips 44
 Now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
 And gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
 And kissing speaks with lustful language broken
 If thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open 48

 He burns with bashful shame she with her tears
 Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
 Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
 To fan and blow them dry again she seeks 52
 He saith she is immodest blames her miss
 What follows more she murders with a kiss

 Even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
 Tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone 56
 Shaking her wings devouring all in haste
 Till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone
 Even so she kissd his brow his cheek his chin
 And where she ends she doth anew begin 60

 Forcd to content but never to obey
 Panting he lies and breatheth in her face
 She feedeth on the steam as on a prey
 And calls it heavenly moisture air of grace 64
 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
 So they were dewd with such distilling showers

 Look how a bird lies tangled in a net
 So fastend in her arms Adonis lies 68
 Pure shame and awd resistance made him fret
 Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
 Rain added to a river that is rank
 Perforce will force it overflow the bank 72


 Still she entreats and prettily entreats
 For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
 Still is he sullen still he lours and frets
 Twixt crimson shame and anger ashypale 76
 Being red she loves him best and being white
 Her best is betterd with a more delight

 Look how he can she cannot choose but love
 And by her fair immortal hand she swears 80
 From his soft bosom never to remove
 Till he take truce with her contending tears
 Which long have raind making her cheeks all wet
 And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt

 Upon this promise did he raise his chin 85
 Like a divedapper peering through a wave
 Who being lookd on ducks as quickly in
 So offers he to give what she did crave 88
 But when her lips were ready for his pay
 He winks and turns his lips another way

 Never did passenger in summers heat
 More thirst for drink than she for this good turn 92
 Her help she sees but help she cannot get
 She bathes in water yet her fire must burn
 O pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
 Tis but a kiss I beg why art thou coy 96

 I have been wood as I entreat thee now
 Even by the stern and direful god of war
 Whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow
 Who conquers where he comes in every jar 100
 Yet hath he been my captive and my slave
 And beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have

 Over my altars hath he hung his lance
 His batterd shield his uncontrolled crest 104
 And for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance
 To toy to wanton dally smile and jest
 Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
 Making my arms his field his tent my bed 108

 Thus he that overruld I overswayd
 Leading him prisoner in a redrose chain
 Strongtemperd steel his stronger strength obeyd
 Yet was he servile to my coy disdain 112
 O be not proud nor brag not of thy might
 For mastering her that foild the god of fight

 Touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine
 Though mine be not so fair yet are they red 116
 The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
 What seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
 Look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
 Then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes 120

 Art thou ashamd to kiss then wink again
 And I will wink so shall the day seem night
 Love keeps his revels where there are but twain
 Be bold to play our sport is not in sight 124
 These blueveind violets whereon we lean
 Never can blab nor know not what we mean

 The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127
 Shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
 Make use of time let not advantage slip
 Beauty within itself should not be wasted
 Fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime
 Rot and consume themselves in little time 132

 Were I hardfavourd foul or wrinkledold
 Illnurturd crooked churlish harsh in voice
 Oerworn despised rheumatic and cold
 Thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice 136
 Then mightst thou pause for then I were not for thee
 But having no defects why dost abhor me

 Thou canst not see one winkle in my brow 139
 Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning
 My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
 My flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
 My smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
 Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt 144

 Bid me discourse I will enchant thine ear
 Or like a fairy trip upon the green
 Or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair
 Dance on the sands and yet no footing seen 148
 Love is a spirit all compact of fire
 Not gross to sink but light and will aspire

 Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie 151
 These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
 Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
 From morn till night even where I list to sport me
 Is love so light sweet boy and may it be
 That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 156

 Is thine own heart to shine own face affected
 Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
 Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
 Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 160
 Narcissus so himself himself forsook
 And died to kiss his shadow in the brook

 Torches are made to light jewels to wear
 Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164
 Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
 Things growing to themselves are growths abuse
 Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
 Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty 168

 Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed
 Unless the earth with thy increase be fed
 By law of nature thou art bound to breed
 That thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172
 And so in spite of death thou dost survive
 In that thy likeness still is left alive

 By this the lovesick queen began to sweat
 For where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176
 And Titan tired in the midday heat
 With burning eye did hotly overlook them
 Wishing Adonis had his team to guide
 So he were like him and by Venus side 180

 And now Adonis with a lazy spright
 And with a heavy dark disliking eye
 His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight
 Like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184
 Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love
 The sun doth burn my face I must remove

 Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind
 What bare excuses makst thou to be gone 188
 Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
 Shall cool the heat of this descending sun
 Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs 191
 If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears

 The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
 And lo I lie between that sun and thee
 The heat I have from thence doth little harm
 Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196
 And were I not immortal life were done
 Between this heavenly and earthly sun

 Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
 Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200
 Art thou a womans son and canst not feel
 What tis to love how want of love tormenteth
 O had thy mother borne so hard a mind 203
 She had not brought forth thee but died unkind


 What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this
 Or what great danger dwells upon my suit
 What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
 Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
 Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again 209
 And one for interest if thou wilt have twain

 Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
 Wellpainted idol image dull and dead 212
 Statue contenting but the eye alone
 Thing like a man but of no woman bred
 Thou art no man though of a mans complexion
 For men will kiss even by their own direction 216

 This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
 And swelling passion doth provoke a pause
 Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong
 Being judge in love she cannot right her cause 220
 And now she weeps and now she fain would speak
 And now her sobs do her intendments break

 Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
 Now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224
 Sometimes her arms infold him like a band
 She would he will not in her arms be bound
 And when from thence he struggles to be gone
 She locks her lily fingers one in one 228

 Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here
 Within the circuit of this ivory pale
 Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer
 Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232
 Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
 Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie

 Within this limit is relief enough
 Sweet bottomgrass and high delightful plain 236
 Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
 To shelter thee from tempest and from rain
 Then be my deer since I am such a park 239
 No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark

 At this Adonis smiles as in disdain
 That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
 Love made those hollows if himself were slain
 He might be buried in a tomb so simple 244
 Foreknowing well if there he came to lie
 Why there Love livd and there he could not die

 These lovely caves these round enchanting pits
 Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking 248
 Being mad before how doth she now for wits
 Struck dead at first what needs a second striking
 Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
 To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 252

 Now which way shall she turn what shall she say
 Her words are done her woes the more increasing
 The time is spent her object will away
 And from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256
 Pity she cries some favour some remorse
 Away he springs and hasteth to his horse

 But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by
 A breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260
 Adonis tramping courier doth espy
 And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
 The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree
 Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 264

 Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
 And now his woven girths he breaks asunder
 The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
 Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder
 The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 269
 Controlling what he was controlled with

 His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane
 Upon his compassd crest now stand on end 272
 His nostrils drink the air and forth again
 As from a furnace vapours doth he send
 His eye which scornfully glisters like fire
 Shows his hot courage and his high desire 276

 Sometime he trots as if he told the steps
 With gentle majesty and modest pride
 Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
 As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried
 And this I do to captivate the eye 281
 Of the fair breeder that is standing by

 What recketh he his riders angry stir
 His flattering Holla or his Stand I say 284
 What cares he now for curb or pricking spur
 For rich caparisons or trapping gay
 He sees his love and nothing else he sees
 Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees 288

 Look when a painter would surpass the life
 In limning out a wellproportiond steed
 His art with natures workmanship at strife
 As if the dead the living should exceed 292
 So did this horse excel a common one
 In shape in courage colour pace and bone

 Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
 Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
 High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
 Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
 Look what a horse should have he did not lack
 Save a proud rider on so proud a back 300

 Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares
 Anon he starts at stirring of a feather
 To bid the wind a base he now prepares
 And wher he run or fly they know not whether 304
 For through his mane and tail the high wind sings
 Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings

 He looks upon his love and neighs unto her
 She answers him as if she knew his mind 308
 Being proud as females are to see him woo her
 She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
 Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
 Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312

 Then like a melancholy malcontent
 He vails his tail that like a falling plume
 Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
 He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316
 His love perceiving how he is enragd
 Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd

 His testy master goeth about to take him
 When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320
 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
 With her the horse and left Adonis there
 As they were mad unto the wood they hie them
 Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324

 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits
 Banning his boisterous and unruly beast
 And now the happy season once more fits
 That lovesick Love by pleading may be blest 328
 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
 When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue

 An oven that is stoppd or river stayd
 Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332
 So of concealed sorrow may be said
 Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage
 But when the hearts attorney once is mute
 The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336

 He sees her coming and begins to glow
 Even as a dying coal revives with wind
 And with his bonnet hides his angry brow
 Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340
 Taking no notice that she is so nigh
 For all askance he holds her in his eye

 O what a sight it was wistly to view
 How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344
 To note the fighting conflict of her hue
 How white and red each other did destroy
 But now her cheek was pale and by and by
 It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348

 Now was she just before him as he sat
 And like a lowly lover down she kneels
 With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
 Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352
 His tenderer cheek receives her soft hands print
 As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint

 O what a war of looks was then between them
 Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356
 His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
 Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing
 And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
 With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain

 Full gently now she takes him by the hand 361
 A lily prisond in a gaol of snow
 Or ivory in an alabaster band
 So white a friend engirts so white a foe 364
 This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
 Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling

 Once more the engine of her thoughts began
 O fairest mover on this mortal round 368
 Would thou wert as I am and I a man
 My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
 For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee
 Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee

 Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it
 Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
 O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
 And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it 376
 Then loves deep groans I never shall regard
 Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard

 For shame he cries let go and let me go
 My days delight is past my horse is gone 380
 And tis your fault I am bereft him so
 I pray you hence and leave me here alone
 For all my mind my thought my busy care
 Is how to get my palfrey from the mare 384

 Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should
 Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
 Affection is a coal that must be coold
 Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire 388
 The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
 Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone

 How like a Jade he stood tied to the tree
 Servilely masterd with a leathern rein 392
 But when he saw his love his youths fair fee
 He held such petty bondage in disdain
 Throwing the base thong from his bending crest
 Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast 396

 Who sees his truelove in her naked bed
 Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
 But when his glutton eye so full hath fed
 His other agents aim at like delight 400
 Who is so faint that dare not be so bold
 To touch the fire the weather being cold

 Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
 And learn of him I heartily beseech thee 404
 To take advantage on presented joy
 Though I were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
 O learn to love the lesson is but plain
 And once made perfect never lost again 408

 I know not love quoth he nor will not know it
 Unless it be a boar and then I chase it
 Tis much to borrow and I will not owe it
 My love to love is love but to disgrace it 412
 For I have heard it is a life in death
 That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath

 Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd
 Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth 416
 If springing things be any jot diminishd
 They wither in their prime prove nothing worth
 The colt thats backd and burdend being young
 Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong 420

 You hurt my hand with wringing Let us part
 And leave this idle theme this bootless chat
 Remove your siege from my unyielding heart
 To loves alarms it will not ope the gate 424
 Dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
 For where a heart is hard they make no battery

 What canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
 O would thou hadst not or I had no hearing 428
 Thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong
 I had my load before now pressd with bearing
 Melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
 Ears deepsweet music and hearts deepsore wounding

 Had I no eyes but ears my ears would love 433
 That inward beauty and invisible
 Or were I deaf thy outward parts would move
 Each part in me that were but sensible 436
 Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
 Yet should I be in love by touching thee

 Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
 And that I could not see nor hear nor touch 440
 And nothing but the very smell were left me
 Yet would my love to thee be still as much
 For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
 Comes breath perfumd that breedeth love by smelling

 But O what banquet wert thou to the taste 445
 Being nurse and feeder of the other four
 Would they not wish the feast might ever last
 And bid Suspicion doublelock the door
 Lest Jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
 Should by his stealing in disturb the feast 448

 Once more the rubycolourd portal opend
 Which to his speech did honey passage yield 452
 Like a red morn that ever yet betokend
 Wrack to the seaman tempest to the field
 Sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
 Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds 456

 This ill presage advisedly she marketh
 Even as the wind is hushd before it raineth
 Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
 Or as the berry breaks before it staineth 460
 Or like the deadly bullet of a gun
 His meaning struck her ere his words begun

 And at his look she flatly falleth down
 For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth 464
 A smile recures the wounding of a frown
 But blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
 The silly boy believing she is dead
 Claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red 468

 And all amazd brake off his late intent
 For sharply he did think to reprehend her
 Which cunning love did wittily prevent
 Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her 472
 For on the grass she lies as she were slain
 Till his breath breatheth life in her again

 He wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
 He bends her fingers holds her pulses hard 476
 He chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
 To mend the hurt that his unkindness marrd
 He kisses her and she by her good will
 Will never rise so he will kiss her still 480

 The night of sorrow now is turnd to day
 Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
 Like the fair sun when in his fresh array
 He cheers the morn and all the world relieveth 484
 And as the bright sun glorifies the sky
 So is her face illumind with her eye

 Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixd
 As if from thence they borrowd all their shine 488
 Were never four such lamps together mixd
 Had not his clouded with his brows repine
 But hers which through the crystal tears gave light
 Shone like the moon in water seen by night 492

 O where am I quoth she in earth or heaven
 Or in the ocean drenchd or in the fire
 What hour is this or morn or weary even
 Do I delight to die or life desire 496
 But now I livd and life was deaths annoy
 But now I died and death was lively joy

 O thou didst kill me kill me once again
 Thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine 500
 Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
 That they have murderd this poor heart of mine
 And these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
 But for thy piteous lips no more had seen 504

 Long may they kiss each other for this cure
 O never let their crimson liveries wear
 And as they last their verdure still endure
 To drive infection from the dangerous year 508
 That the stargazers having writ on death
 May say the plague is banishd by thy breath

 Pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
 What bargains may I make still to be sealing 512
 To sell myself I can be well contented
 So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
 Which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
 Set thy sealmanual on my waxred lips 516

 A thousand kisses buys my heart from me
 And pay them at thy leisure one by one
 What is ten hundred touches unto thee
 Are they not quickly told and quickly gone 520
 Say for nonpayment that the debt should double
 Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble

 Fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
 Measure my strangeness with my unripe years 524
 Before I know myself seek not to know me
 No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
 The mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
 Or being early pluckd is sour to taste 528

 Look the worlds comforter with weary gait
 His days hot task hath ended in the west
 The owl nights herald shrieks tis very late
 The sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest 532
 And coalblack clouds that shadow heavens light
 Do summon us to part and bid good night

 Now let me say good night and so say you
 If you will say so you shall have a kiss 536
 Good night quoth she and ere he says adieu
 The honey fee of parting tenderd is
 Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
 Incorporate then they seem face grows to face 540

 Till breathless he disjoind and backward drew
 The heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
 Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
 Whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth 544
 He with her plenty pressd she faint with dearth
 Their lips together glud fall to the earth

 Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
 And gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth 548
 Her lips are conquerors his lips obey
 Paying what ransom the insulter willeth
 Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
 That she will draw his lips rich treasure dry 552

 And having felt the sweetness of the spoil
 With blindfold fury she begins to forage
 Her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
 And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage 556
 Planting oblivion beating reason back
 Forgetting shames pure blush and honours wrack

 Hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
 Like a wild bird being tamd with too much handling
 Or as the fleetfoot roe thats tird with chasing 561
 Or like the froward infant stilld with dandling
 He now obeys and now no more resisteth
 While she takes all she can not all she listeth 564

 What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
 And yields at last to every light impression
 Things out of hope are compassd oft with venturing
 Chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission 568
 Affection faints not like a palefacd coward
 But then woos best when most his choice is froward

 When he did frown O had she then gave over
 Such nectar from his lips she had not suckd 572
 Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
 What though the rose have prickles yet tis pluckd
 Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
 Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last

 For pity now she can no more detain him 577
 The poor fool prays her that he may depart
 She is resolvd no longer to restrain him
 Bids him farewell and look well to her heart 580
 The which by Cupids bow she doth protest
 He carries thence incaged in his breast

 Sweet boy she says this night Ill waste in sorrow
 For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch 584
 Tell me Loves master shall we meet tomorrow
 Say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match
 He tells her no tomorrow he intends
 To hunt the boar with certain of his friends 588

 The boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
 Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
 Usurps her cheeks she trembles at his tale
 And on his neck her yoking arms she throws 592
 She sinketh down still hanging by his neck
 He on her belly falls she on her back

 Now is she in the very lists of love
 Her champion mounted for the hot encounter 596
 All is imaginary she doth prove
 He will not manage her although he mount her
 That worse than Tantalus is her annoy
 To clip Elysium and to lack her joy 600

 Even as poor birds deceivd with painted grapes
 Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
 Even so she languisheth in her mishaps
 As those poor birds that helpless berries saw 604
 The warm effects which she in him finds missing
 She seeks to kindle with continual kissing

 But all in vain good queen it will not be
 She hath assayd as much as may be provd 608
 Her pleading hath deservd a greater fee
 Shes Love she loves and yet she is not lovd
 Fie fie he says you crush me let me go
 You have no reason to withhold me so 612

 Thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
 But that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the boar
 O be advisd thou knowst not what it is
 With javelins point a churlish swine to gore 616
 Whose tushes never sheathd he whetteth still
 Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill

 On his bowback he hath a battle set
 Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes 620
 His eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
 His snout digs sepulchres whereer he goes
 Being movd he strikes whateer is in his way
 And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay 624

 His brawny sides with hairy bristles armd
 Are better proof than thy spears point can enter
 His short thick neck cannot be easily harmd
 Being ireful on the lion he will venture 628
 The thorny brambles and embracing bushes
 As fearful of him part through whom he rushes

 Alas he nought esteems that face of thine
 To which Loves eyes pay tributary gazes 632
 Nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
 Whose full perfection all the world amazes
 But having thee at vantage wondrous dread
 Would root these beauties as he roots the mead

 O let him keep his loathsome cabin still 637
 Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
 Come not within his danger by thy will
 They that thrive well take counsel of their friends
 When thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
 I feard thy fortune and my joints did tremble

 Didst thou not mark my face was it not white
 Sawst thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye 644
 Grew I not faint And fell I not downright
 Within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
 My boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
 But like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast

 For where Love reigns disturbing Jealousy 649
 Doth call himself Affections sentinel
 Gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
 And in a peaceful hour doth cry Kill kill 652
 Distempering gentle Love in his desire
 As air and water do abate the fire

 This sour informer this batebreeding spy
 This canker that eats up Loves tender spring 656
 This carrytale dissentious Jealousy
 That sometime true news sometime false doth bring
 Knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear
 That if I love thee I thy death should fear 660

 And more than so presenteth to mine eye
 The picture of an angrychafing boar
 Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
 An image like thyself all staind with gore 664
 Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
 Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head

 What should I do seeing thee so indeed
 That tremble at the imagination 668
 The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
 And fear doth teach it divination
 I prophesy thy death my living sorrow
 If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow 672

 But if thou needs wilt hunt be ruld by me
 Uncouple at the timorous flying hare
 Or at the fox which lives by subtilty
 Or at the roe which no encounter dare 676
 Pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs
 And on thy wellbreathd horse keep with thy hound

 And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
 Mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles 680
 How he outruns the winds and with what care
 He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
 The many musits through the which he goes
 Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes 684

 Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
 To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
 And sometime where earthdelving conies keep
 To stop the loud pursuers in their yell 688
 And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
 Danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear

 For there his smell with others being mingled 691
 The hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
 Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
 With much ado the cold fault cleanly out
 Then do they spend their mouths Echo replies
 As if another chase were in the skies 696

 By this poor Wat far off upon a hill
 Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
 To hearken if his foes pursue him still
 Anon their loud alarums he doth hear 700
 And now his grief may be compared well
 To one sore sick that hears the passing bell

 Then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
 Turn and return indenting with the way 704
 Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch
 Each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
 For misery is trodden on by many
 And being low never relievd by any 708

 Lie quietly and hear a little more
 Nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
 To make thee hate the hunting of the boar
 Unlike myself thou hearst me moralize 712
 Applying this to that and so to so
 For love can comment upon every woe

 Where did I leave No matter where quoth he
 Leave me and then the story aptly ends 716
 The night is spent Why what of that quoth she
 I am quoth he expected of my friends
 And now tis dark and going I shall fall
 In night quoth she desire sees best of all 720

 But if thou fall O then imagine this
 The earth in love with thee thy footing trips
 And all is but to rob thee of a kiss 723
 Rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
 Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn
 Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn

 Now of this dark night I perceive the reason
 Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 728
 Till forging Nature be condemnd of treason
 For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
 Wherein she framd thee in high heavens despite
 To shame the sun by day and her by night 732

 And therefore hath she bribd the Destinies
 To cross the curious workmanship of nature
 To mingle beauty with infirmities
 And pure perfection with impure defeature 736
 Making it subject to the tyranny
 Of mad mischances and much misery

 As burning fevers agues pale and faint
 Lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood 740
 The marroweating sickness whose attains
 Disorder breeds by heating of the blood
 Surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair
 Swear natures death for framing thee so fair 744

 And not the least of all these maladies
 But in one minutes fight brings beauty under
 Both favour savour hue and qualities
 Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder 748
 Are on the sudden wasted thawd and done
 As mountainsnow melts with the midday sun

 Therefore despite of fruitless chastity
 Lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns 752
 That on the earth would breed a scarcity
 And barren dearth of daughters and of sons
 Be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
 Dries up his oil to lend the world his light 756

 What is thy body but a swallowing grave
 Seeming to bury that posterity
 Which by the rights of time thou needs must have
 If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity 760
 If so the world will hold thee in disdain
 Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain


 So in thyself thyself art made away
 A mischief worse than civil homebred strife 764
 Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
 Or butchersire that reeves his son of life
 Foulcankering rust the hidden treasure frets
 But gold thats put to use more gold begets 768

 Nay then quoth Adon you will fall again
 Into your idle overhandled theme
 The kiss I gave you is bestowd in vain
 And all in vain you strive against the stream 772
 For by this blackfacd night desires foul nurse
 Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse

 If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
 And every tongue more moving than your own 776
 Bewitching like the wanton mermaids songs
 Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
 For know my heart stands armed in mine ear
 And will not let a false sound enter there 780

 Lest the deceiving harmony should run
 Into the quiet closure of my breast
 And then my little heart were quite undone
 In his bedchamber to be barrd of rest 784
 No lady no my heart longs not to groan
 But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone

 What have you urgd that I cannot reprove
 The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger 790
 I hate not love but your device in love
 That lends embracements unto every stranger
 You do it for increase O strange excuse
 When reason is the bawd to lusts abuse 792

 Call it not love for Love to heaven is fled
 Since sweating Lust on earth usurpd his name
 Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
 Upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame 796
 Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
 As caterpillars do the tender leaves

 Love comforteth like sunshine after rain
 But Lusts effect is tempest after sun 800
 Loves gentle spring doth always fresh remain
 Lusts winter comes ere summer half be done
 Love surfeits not Lust like a glutton dies
 Love is all truth Lust full of forged lies 804

 More I could tell but more I dare not say
 The text is old the orator too green
 Therefore in sadness now I will away
 My face is full of shame my heart of teen 808
 Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
 Do burn themselves for having so offended

 With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace 811
 Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
 And homeward through the dark laund runs apace
 Leaves Love upon her back deeply distressd
 Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
 So glides he in the night from Venus eye 816

 Which after him she darts as one on shore
 Gazing upon a lateembarked friend
 Till the wild waves will have him seen no more
 Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend 820
 So did the merciless and pitchy night
 Fold in the object that did feed her sight

 Whereat amazd as one that unaware
 Hath droppd a precious jewel in the flood 824
 Or stonishd as nightwanderers often are
 Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
 Even so confounded in the dark she lay
 Having lost the fair discovery of her way 828

 And now she beats her heart whereat it groans
 That all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
 Make verbal repetition of her moans
 Passion on passion deeply is redoubled 832
 Ay me she cries and twenty times Woe woe
 And twenty echoes twenty times cry so

 She marking them begins a wailing note
 And sings extemporally a woeful ditty 836
 How love makes young men thrall and old men dote
 How love is wise in folly foolishwitty
 Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
 And still the choir of echoes answer so 840

 Her song was tedious and outwore the night
 For lovers hours are long though seeming short
 If pleasd themselves others they think delight
 In such like circumstance with such like sport 844
 Their copious stories oftentimes begun
 End without audience and are never done

 For who hath she to spend the night withal
 But idle sounds resembling parasites 848
 Like shrilltongud tapsters answering every call
 Soothing the humour of fantastic wits
 She says Tis so they answer all Tis so
 And would say after her if she said No 852

 Lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
 From his moist cabinet mounts up on high
 And wakes the morning from whose silver breast
 The sun ariseth in his majesty 856
 Who doth the world so gloriously behold
 That cedartops and hills seem burnishd gold

 Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow
 O thou clear god and patron of all light 860
 From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
 The beauteous influence that makes him bright
 There lives a son that suckd an earthly mother
 May lend thee light as thou dost lend to other

 This said she hasteth to a myrtle grove 865
 Musing the morning is so much oerworn
 And yet she hears no tidings of her love
 She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn 868
 Anon she hears them chant it lustily
 And all in haste she coasteth to the cry

 And as she runs the bushes in the way
 Some catch her by the neck some kiss her face 872
 Some twine about her thigh to make her stay
 She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
 Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
 Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake 876

 By this she hears the hounds are at a bay
 Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
 Wreathd up in fatal folds just in his way
 The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
 Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds 881
 Appals her senses and her spirit confounds

 For now she knows it is no gentle chase
 But the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud 884
 Because the cry remaineth in one place
 Wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
 Finding their enemy to be so curst
 They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first

 This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear 889
 Througll which it enters to surprise her heart
 Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
 With coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part
 Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
 They basely fly and dare not stay the field

 Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
 Till cheering up her senses sore dismayd 896
 She tells them tis a causeless fantasy
 And childish error that they are afraid
 Bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
 And with that word she spied the hunted boar

 Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red 901
 Like milk and blood being mingled both together
 A second fear through all her sinews spread
 Which madly hurries her she knows not whither 904
 This way she runs and now she will no further
 But back retires to rate the boar for murther

 A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
 She treads the path that she untreads again 908
 Her more than haste is mated with delays
 Like the proceedings of a drunken brain
 Full of respects yet nought at all respecting
 In hand with all things nought at all effecting

 Here kenneld in a brake she finds a hound 913
 And asks the weary caitiff for his master
 And there another licking of his wound
 Gainst venomd sores the only sovereign plaster 916
 And here she meets another sadly scowling
 To whom she speaks and he replies with howling

 When he hath ceasd his illresounding noise
 Another flapmouthd mourner black and grim 920
 Against the welkin volleys out his voice
 Another and another answer him
 Clapping their proud tails to the ground below
 Shaking their scratchd ears bleeding as they go

 Look how the worlds poor people are amazd 925
 At apparitions signs and prodigies
 Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazd
 Infusing them with dreadful prophecies 928
 So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath
 And sighing it again exclaims on Death

 Hardfavourd tyrant ugly meagre lean 931
 Hateful divorce of lovethus chides she Death
 Grimgrinning ghost earths worm what dost thou mean
 To stifle beauty and to steal his breath
 Who when he livd his breath and beauty set
 Gloss on the rose smell to the violet 936

 If he be dead O no it cannot be
 Seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
 O yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
 But hatefully at random dost thou hit 940
 Thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
 Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infants heart

 Hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
 And hearing him thy power had lost his power 944
 The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke
 They bid thee crop a weed thou pluckst a flower
 Loves golden arrow at him shoull have fled
 And not Deaths ebon dart to strike him dead 948

 Dost thou drink tears that thou provokst such weeping
 What may a heavy groan advantage thee
 Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
 Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see 952
 Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
 Since her best work is ruind with thy rigour

 Here overcome as one full of despair
 She vaild her eyelids who like sluices stoppd 956
 The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
 In the sweet channel of her bosom droppd
 But through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
 And with his strong course opens them again 960

 O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
 Her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
 Both crystals where they viewd each others sorrow
 Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry 964
 But like a stormy day now wind now rain
 Sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again

 Variable passions throng her constant woe
 As striving who should best become her grief 968
 All entertaind each passion labours so
 That every present sorrow seemeth chief
 But none is best then join they all together
 Like many clouds consulting for foul weather 972

 By this far off she hears some huntsman holloa
 A nurses song noer pleasd her babe so well
 The dire imagination she did follow
 This sound of hope doth labour to expel 976
 For now reviving joy bids her rejoice
 And flatters her it is Adonis voice

 Whereat her tears began to turn their tide
 Being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass 980
 Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
 Which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
 To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
 Who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd

 O hardbelieving love how strange it seems 985
 Not to believe and yet too credulous
 Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
 Despair and hope make thee ridiculous 988
 The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
 In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly

 Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
 Adonis lives and Death is not to blame 992
 It was not she that calld him all to naught
 Now she adds honours to his hateful name
 She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
 Imperious supreme of all mortal things 996

 No no quoth she sweet Death I did but jest
 Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear
 Whenas I met the boar that bloody beast
 Which knows no pity but is still severe 1000
 Then gentle shadowtruth I must confess
 I raild on thee fearing my loves decease

 Tis not my fault the boar provokd my tongue
 Be wreakd on him invisible commander 1004
 Tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
 I did but act he s author of my slander
 Grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
 Could rule them both without ten womens wit

 Thus hoping that Adonis is alive 1009
 Her rash suspect sile doth extenuate
 And that his beauty may the better thrive
 With Death she humbly doth insinuate 1012
 Tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
 His victories his triumphs and his glories

 O Jove quoth she how much a fool was I
 To be of such a weak and silly mind 1016
 To wail his death who lives and must not die
 Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
 For he being dead with him is beauty slain
 And beauty dead black chaos comes again 1020

 Fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
 As one with treasure laden hemmd with thieves
 Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
 Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves 1024
 Even at this word she hears a merry horn
 Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn

 As falcon to the lure away she flies
 The grass stoops not she treads on it so light 1028
 And in her haste unfortunately spies
 The foul boars conquest on her fair delight
 Which seen her eyes as murderd with the view
 Like stars ashamd of day themselves withdrew

 Or as the snail whose tender horns being hit 1033
 Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain
 And there all smotherd up in shade doth sit
 Long after fearing to creep forth again 1036
 So at his bloody view her eyes are fled
 Into the deep dark cabills of her head

 Where they resign their office and their light
 To the disposing of her troubled brain 1040
 Who bids them still consort with ugly night
 And never wound the heart with looks again
 Who like a king perplexed in his throne
 By their suggestion gives a deadly groan 1044

 Whereat each tributary subject quakes
 As when the wind imprisond in the ground
 Struggling for passage earths foundation shakes
 Which with cold terror doth mens minds confound
 This mutiny each part doth so surprise 1049
 That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes

 And being opend threw unwilling light
 Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenchd
 In his soft flank whose wonted lily white 1053
 With purple tears that his wound wept was drenchd
 No flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
 But stole his blood and seemd with him to bleed

 This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth 1057
 Over one shoulder doth she hang her head
 Dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
 She thinks he could not die he is not dead 1060
 Her voice is stoppd her joints forget to bow
 Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now

 Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
 That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
 And then she reprehends her mangling eye 1065
 That makes more gashes where no breach should be
 His face seems twain each several limb is doubled
 For oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled

 My tongue cannot express my grief for one 1069
 And yet quoth she behold two Adons dead
 My sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
 Mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead 1072
 Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire
 So shall I die by drops of hot desire

 Alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
 What face remains alive thats worth the viewing
 Whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
 Of things long since or anything ensuing 1078
 The flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
 But truesweet beauty livd and died with him

 Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear 1081
 Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
 Having no fair to lose you need not fear
 The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
 But when Adonis livd sun and sharp air 1085
 Lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair

 And therefore would he put his bonnet on
 Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 1088
 The wind would blow it off and being gone
 Play with his locks then would Adonis weep
 And straight in pity of his tender years
 They both would strive who first should dry his tears

 To see his face the lion walkd along 1093
 Behind some hedge because he would not fear him
 To recreate himself when he hath sung
 The tiger would be tame and gently hear him 1096
 If he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
 And never fright the silly lamb that day

 When he beheld his shadow in the brook
 The fishes spread on it their golden gills 1100
 When he was by the birds such pleasure took
 That some would sing some other in their bills
 Would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
 He fed them with his sight they him with berries

 But this foul grim and urchinspouted boar 1105
 Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
 Neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore
 Witness the entertainment that he gave 1108
 If he did see his face why then I know
 He thought to kiss him and hath killed him so

 Tis true tis true thus was Adonis slain
 He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 1112
 Who did not whet his teeth at him again
 But by a kiss thought to persuade him there
 And nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
 Sheathd unaware the tusk in his soft groin 1116

 Had I been toothd like him I must confess
 With kissing him I should have killd him first
 But he is dead and never did he bless
 My youth with his the more am I accurst 1120
 With this she falleth in the place she stood
 And stains her face with his congealed blood

 Sho looks upon his lips and they are pale
 She takes him by the hand and that is cold 1124
 She whispers in his ears a heavy tale
 As if they heard the woeful words she told
 She lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
 Where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies

 Two glasses where herself herself beheld 1129
 A thousand times and now no more reflect
 Their virtue lost wherein they late excelld
 And every beauty robbd of his effect 1132
 Wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
 That you being dead the day should yet be light

 Since thou art dead lo here I prophesy
 Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 1136
 It shall be waited on with jealousy
 Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
 Neer settled equally but high or low
 That all loves pleasure shall not match his woe

 It shall be fickle false and full of fraud 1141
 Bud and be blasted in a breathingwhile
 The bottom poison and the top oerstrawd
 With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile 1144
 The strongest body shall it make most weak
 Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak

 It shall be sparing and too full of riot
 Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 1148
 The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
 Pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
 It shall be raging mad and silly mild
 Make the young old the old become a child 1152

 It shall suspect where is no cause of fear
 It shall not fear where it should most mistrust
 It shall be merciful and too severe
 And most deceiving when it seems most just 1156
 Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
 Put fear to velour courage to the coward

 It shall be cause of war and dire events
 And set dissension twixt the son and sire 1160
 Subject and servile to all discontents
 As dry combustious matter is to fire
 Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy
 They that love best their love shall not enjoy 1164

 By this the boy that by her side lay killd
 Was melted like a vapour from her sight
 And in his blood that on the ground lay spilld
 A purple flower sprung up chequerd with white 1168
 Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
 Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood

 She bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
 Comparing it to her Adonis breath 1172
 And says within her bosom it shall dwell
 Since he himself is reft from her by death
 She drops the stalk and in the breach appears
 Green dropping sap which she compares to tears

 Poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
 Sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
 For every little grief to wet his eyes
 To grow unto himself was his desire 1180
 And so tis shine but know it is as good
 To wither in my breast as in his blood

 Here was thy fathers bed here in my breast
 Thou art the next of blood and tis thy right 1184
 Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
 My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
 There shall not be one minute in an hour
 Wherein I will not kiss my sweet loves flower

 Thus weary of the world away she hies 1189
 And yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
 Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
 In her light chariot quickly is conveyd 1192
 Holding their course to Paphos where their queen
 Means to immure herself and not be seen
