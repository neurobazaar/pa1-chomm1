fire Confound that fire Its out for good now Let it go Sits and
takes music score Nibelungs They are realer than anybody guesses
People who spend their lives in digging for gold and know and care
about nothing else How many of them Ive met at mothers dinner
parties Well I must get to my work now Makes a few notes then
looks up and stretches Ah me I dont know what makes me so lazy this
evening This strange heaviness There seems to be a spell on me Gazes
about How beautiful these woods are at sunset If I were a Nibelung
Id come here for certain Settles himself reclining shadows begin to
fall music from orchestra Im good for nothing but dreaming I wish
Estelle were here to sing to me How magical the twilight is Estelle
Estelle

He lies motionless music dies away and there is a long silence The
forest is dark with gleams of moonlight Suddenly there is a faint note
of music the Nibelung theme After a silence it is repeated then
again Several instruments take it up It swells louder Vague forms are
seen flitting here and there Shadows move

GERALD Starting up suddenly Whats that Silence then the note is
heard again very faint He starts It is heard again and he springs to
his feet Whats that Again and again He runs to his violin picks
it up and stares at it Still the notes are heard and he puts down the
violin and runs down stage listening Why what can it mean As the
music grows louder his perplexity and alarm increase Suddenly he sees a
figure stealing through the shadows and he springs back aghast
Why its a Nibelung Another figure passes Oh I must be dreaming
Several more appear Nibelungs Why its absurd Wake up man
Youre going crazy Music swells louder figures appear carrying gold
shields chains etc with clatter My God

He stands with hands clasped to his forehead while the uproar swells
louder and louder and the forms become more numerous He rushes down
stage and the Nibelungs surround him dancing about him in wild career
laughing screaming jeering They begin to pinch his legs behind his
back and he leaps here and there crying out Gradually they drive him
toward the grotto which opens before them revealing a black chasm
emitting clouds of steam They rush in and are enveloped in the mist
Sounds of falling and crashing are heard The steam spreads gradually
veiling the front of the stage

Nets rise with the steam giving the effect of a descent During this
change the orchestra plays the music between Scenes II and III in Das
Rheingold




SCENE II


Nibelheim a vast rocky cavern Right centre is a large gold throne
and to the right of that an entrance through a great tunnel Entrances
from the sides also At the left is a large golden vase upon a stand
and near it lie piles of golden utensils shields etc Left centre is a
heavy iron door opening into a vault Throughout this scene there is a
suggestion of music rising into full orchestra at significant moments
The voices of the Nibelungs are accompanied by stopped trumpets and
other weird sounds

At rise The stage is dark A faint light spreads A company of
Nibelungs crosses from right to left carrying trinkets and treasures
Clatter of shields crack of whips music etc Another company of
Nibelungs runs in left

ALL Prince Hagen Prince Hagen

MIMI Calling Prince Hagen

Some run out The call is heard off All stand waiting in tense
expectation The music plays the Hagen motives with suggestions of the
Siegfried funeral march Voices are heard in the distance and at the
climax of the music PRINCE HAGEN and his keepers enter He is small for
a man but larger than any of the Nibelungs a grim sinister figure
with black hair and a glowering look His hands are chained in front of
him and eight Nibelungs march as a guard He has bare arms and limbs
and a rough black bearskin flung over his shoulders He enters right
and stands glaring from one to another

ALB Good evening Hagen

HAGEN After a pause Well

ALB Hesitating Hagen you are still angry and rebellious

HAGEN I am

ALB Pleading Hagen you are my grandson You are my sole heir
the only representative of my line You are all that I have in the
world

HAGEN Well

ALB You place me in such a trying position Have you no shame no
conscience Why some day you will be king and one cannot keep a king
in chains

HAGEN I do not want to be in chains

ALB But Hagen your conduct is such what can I do You have
robbed you have threatened murder And you my grandson and my
heir

HAGEN Have you sent for me to preach at me again

ALB Hagen this stranger he has come to visit us from the world
above These earthmen know more than we they have greater powers

He hesitates

HAGEN What is all that to me

ALB You know that you yourself are threequarters an earthman

HAGEN I know it With a passionate gesture But I am in chains

ALB There may be a way of your having another chance Perhaps this
stranger will teach you If you will promise to obey him he will
stay with you he will be your tutor and show you the ways of the
earthmen

HAGEN No

ALB What

HAGEN I will not have it

ALB Hagen

HAGEN I will not have it I say Why did you not consult me

ALB But what is your objection

HAGEN I will not obey an earthman I will not obey anyone

ALB But he will teach you

HAGEN I do not want to be taught I want to be let alone Take off
these chains

ALB Half rising Hagen I insist

HAGEN Take them off I say You cannot conquer me you cannot trick
me

ALB Angrily Take him away

The Nibelungs seize hold of him to hustle him off

HAGEN I will not obey him Mark what I say I will kill him Yes I
will kill him

He is dragged off protesting

ALB Sits his head bowed with grief until the uproar dies away then
looking up Mimi

MIMI Yes your majesty

ALB Let the earthman be brought

MIMI Yes your majesty

ALL The earthman The earthman

The call is heard as before GERALD is brought on the orchestra plays
a beautiful melody violins and horns MIMI moves left to meet him

GERALD Enters left with attendants hesitating gazing about in
wonder He sees MIMI and stops a pause The pack peddler

MIMI The pack peddler

GER And these are Nibelungs

MIMI You call us that

GER Laughing nervously You er its a little disconcerting you
know I had no idea you existed May I ask your name

MIMI I am Mimi

GER Mimi Mimi the smith And may I ask are you real or is this a
dream

MIMI Is not life a dream

GER Yes but

MIMI It is a story You have to pretend that it is true

GER I see

MIMI You pretend that it is true and then you see what happens It
is very interesting

GER Yes I have no doubt Peers at him And just to help me
straighten things out would you mind telling me are you old or
young

MIMI I am young

GER How young

MIMI Nine hundred years young

GER Oh And why did you come for me

MIMI The king commanded it

GER The king And who may this king be

MIMI King Alberich

GER Alberich Stares at the king And is this he

MIMI It is he

GER And may I speak to him

MIMI You may

ALB Let the earthman advance Hail

GER Good evening Alberich

MIMI At his elbow Your majesty

GER Good evening your majesty

ALB After along gaze You play our music Where did you learn it

GER Why its in Wagners operas He composed it

ALB Humph composed it

GER Aghast You mean he came and copied it

ALB Of course

GER Why why we all thought it was original

ALB Original It is indeed wonderful originality To listen in the
Rhinedepths to the song of the maidens to dwell in the forest and
steal its murmurs to catch the crackling of the fire and the flowing
of the water the galloping of the wind and the death march of the
thunder and then write it all down for your own To take our story
and tell it just as it happened to take the very words from our lips
and sign your name to them Originality

GER But your majesty one thing at least Even his enemies granted him
that He invented the invisible orchestra

ALB Laughing Have you seen any orchestra here

Siegfried motive sounds

GER I hadnt realized it Do you mean that everything here happens to
music

ALB If you only had the ears to hear you would know that the whole
world happens to music

GER Stands entranced Listen Listen

ALB It is very monotonous when one is digging out the gold It keeps
up such a wheezing and pounding

Stopped trumpets from orchestra

GER Ah dont speak of such things Gazes about sees cup What is
this

ALB That is the coronation cup

GER The coronation cup

ALB One of the greatest of our treasures It is worth over four hundred
thousand dollars It is the work of the elder Mimi a most wonderful
smith

GER Advancing May I look at it

ALB You will observe the design of the Rhine maidens

GER I cant see it here Its too dark Let me have a candle

MIMI A candle

ALL A candle

ALB My dear sir Candles are so expensive And why do you want to see
it We never look at our art treasures

GER Never look at them

ALB No We know what they are worth and everyone else knows and what
difference does it make how they look

GER Oh I see

ALB Perhaps you would like to see our vaults of gold Great excitement
among the Nibelungs The music makes a furious uproar ALBERICH gives a
great key to MIMI who opens the iron doors Approach sir

MIMI Hear the echoes Shouts

GER It must be a vast place

ALB This particular cavern runs for seventeen miles under the earth

GER What And you mean it is all full of gold

ALB From floor to roof with solid masses of it

GER Incredible Is it all of the Nibelung treasure

ALB All Mercy no This is simply my own and I am by no means a rich
man The extent of some of our modern fortunes would simply exceed your
belief We live in an age of enormous productivity After a pause
Will you see more of the vault

GER No I thank you They close it It must be getting late and by
the way your majesty you know that no one has told me yet why you had
me brought here

ALB Ah yes sure enough We have business to talk about Let us get to
it To MIMI Let the hall be cleared MIMI drives out the Nibelungs
and retires Sit on this rock here beside me Confidentially Now we
can talk things over I trust you are willing to listen to me

GER Most certainly I am very much interested

ALB Thank you You know my dear sir that I had a son Hagen who was
the slayer of the great hero Siegfried

GER Yes your majesty

ALB A most lamentable affair You did not know I presume that Hagen
too had a son by one of the daughters of earth

GER No He is not mentioned in history

ALB That son Prince Hagen is now living and in the course of
events he will fall heir to the throne I occupy

GER I see

ALB The boy is seven or eight hundred years old which in your
measure would make him about eighteen Now I speak frankly The boy is
wild and unruly He needs guidance and occupation And I have sent
for you because I understand that you earthpeople think more and see
farther than we do

GER Yes

ALB I wish to ask you to help me to use your strength of mind and
body to direct this boy

GER But what can I do

ALB I wish you to stay here and be Prince Hagens tutor

GER What

ALB Anxiously If you will do it sir you will carry hence a
treasure such as the world has never seen before And it is a noble
work a great work sir He is the grandson of a king Tell me 
will you help me

Gazes imploringly

GER Let me think A pause Your majesty I have things of importance
to do and I have no time to stay here

ALB But think of the treasures

GER My father is a rich man and I have no need of treasures And
besides I am a poet I have work of my own

ALB Oh dont refuse me sir

GER Listen There is perhaps something else we can do How would it
do to take Prince Hagen up to the world

ALB Starting Oh

GER This world is a small one There he might have a wide field for his
energies He might be sent to a good school and taught the ideals of
our Christian civilization

ALB Pondering anxiously You mean that you yourself would see to it
that proper care was given to him

GER If I took him with me it would mean that I was interested in his
future

ALB It is a startling proposition What opportunity can you offer him

GER I am only a student myself But my father is a man of importance in
the world

ALB What does he do

GER He is John Isman They call him the railroad king

ALB You have kings in your world also

GER Smiling After a fashion yes

ALB I had not thought of this I hardly know what to reply He
starts What is that

An uproar is heard of left Shouts and cries music rises to deafening
climax Nibelungs flee on in terror

HAGEN Rushes on struggling wildly and dragging several Nibelungs
Let me go I say Take off these chains

ALB Rising in seat Hagen

HAGEN I will not stand it I tell you

ALB Hagen Listen to me

HAGEN No

ALB I have something new to tell you The earthman has suggested
taking you up with him to the world

HAGEN A sudden wild expression flashes across his features No He
gazes from one to the other half beside himself You cant mean it

ALB It is true Hagen

HAGEN What why

ALB You would be sent to school and taught the ways of the earthmen
Do you think that you would like to go

HAGEN Wildly By the gods I would

ALB Nervously You will promise to obey

HAGEN Ill promise anything Ill do anything

ALB Hagen this is a very grave decision for me It is such an unusual
step You would have to submit yourself to this gentleman who is kind
enough to take charge of you

HAGEN I Will I will Quick Holding out his chains Take them off

ALB Doubtfully We can trust you

HAGEN You can trust me Youll have no trouble Take them off

ALB Off with them

MIMI Advances and proceeds to work at chains with a file Yes your
majesty

HAGEN TO GERALD Tell me What am I to do

GER You are to have an education

HAGEN Yes Whats it like Tell me more about the earthpeople

GER Its too much to try to tell You will be there soon

HAGEN Ah Be quick there Tears one hand free and waves it By the
gods

ALB To GERALD You had best spend the night with us and consult with
me

HAGEN No no No delay Whats there to consult about

ALB We have so much to settle your clothes your money

HAGEN Give me some gold that will be all Let us be off

GER I will attend to everything There is no need of delay

HAGEN Come on Tears other hand free Aha Roams about the stage
clenching his hands and gesticulating while the music rises to a
tremendous climax Free Free forever Aha Aha Turning to GERALD
Let us be off

GER All right To ALBERICH Goodbye your majesty

ALB Anxiously Goodbye

HAGEN Come on

ALB As Nibelungs gather about waving farewell Take care of
yourself Come back to me

HAGEN Free Free Ha ha ha

HAGEN Free

Exit with GERALD amid chorus of farewells and wild uproar of music

GER Tell me the story

EST Why you know Lord Alderdyce had heard about this wild fellow
Steve OHagen whos made such a sensation this campaign And hes
interested in our election and wanted to hear OHagen speak He said
he had a friend whod arrange for us to be introduced to him and so
we went down there And there was a most frightful crowd it was an
outdoor meeting you know We pushed our way into a saloon where the
mob was shouting around this OHagen And then he caught sight of us
and Gerald from the moment he saw me he never took his eyes off me
Never once

GER Smiling Well Estelle youve been looked at before

EST Ah but never like that

GER What sort of a man is he

EST Hes small and dark and ugly he wore a rough reefer and cap 
but Gerald hes no common man Theres something strange and terrible
about him theres a fire blazing in him The detective who was with
us introduced us to him and he stood there and stared at me I tried
to say something or other Ive been so interested in your speech
Mr OHagen And he laughed at me Yes Ive no doubt And then
suddenly it was as if he leaped at me He pointed his finger straight
into my face and his eyes fairly shone Wait for me Ill be with you
Im coming to the top

EST Imagine it I was simply paralyzed Mark what I tell you he went
on itll be of interest to you some day to remember it You may wait

us as he rushed on You have joy and power and freedom all the
privileges of life all things that are excellent and beautiful You
are born to them you claim them And you come down here to stare at
us as you might at some strange animals in a cage You chatter and laugh
and go your way but remember what I told you  I shall be with you
You cannot keep ME down I shall be master of you all

GER Incredible

EST And then in a moment it was all over He made a mocking bow to the
party It has given me the greatest pleasure in the world to meet
you And with a wild laugh he went out of the door and the crowd in
the street burst into a roar that was like a clap of thunder A pause
Gerald what do you think he meant

GER My dear youve been up against the classwar Its rather the
fashion now you know

EST Oh but it was horrible I cant get it out of my mind We heard
some of his speech afterwards and it seemed as if every word of
it was meant for me He lashed the crowd to a perfect fury I think
theyd have set fire to the city if hed told them to What do you
suppose he expects to do

GER I cant imagine Im sure

EST I should like to know more about him He was never raised in the
slums I feel certain

GER Steve OHagen The name sounds Irish

EST I dont think hes Irish Hes dark and strangelooking almost
uncanny

GER I shall go down there and hear him the first chance I get And now
I guess Id best get out if I want to dodge old Plimpton

EST Yes and Rutherford too Isnt it a bore I think they are
perfectly odious people

GER Why do you suppose mother invited them

EST Oh its a business affair they have forced their way into some
deal of fathers and so we have to cultivate them

GER Plimpton the coal baron And Rutherford the steel king I wonder
how many hundred millions of dollars we shall have to have before we can
choose our guests for something more interesting than their Wall Street
connections

EST I think I hear them Listens Yes the voice Mocking
PLIMPTONS manner and tone Good evening Miss Isman I guess Ill skip
it

Exit right

GER And I too

Exit left

RUTHERFORD A stout and rather coarselooking man enters right with
PLIMPTON Its certainly an outrageous state of affairs Plimpton

PLIMPTON A thin clericallooking person with squarecut beard
Disgraceful Disgraceful

RUTH The public seems to be quite hysterical

PLIMP We have got to a state where simply to be entrusted with great
financial responsibility is enough to constitute a man a criminal to
warrant a newspaper in prying into the intimate details of his life and
in presenting him in hideous caricatures

RUTH I can sympathize with you Plimpton these government
investigations are certainly a trial Laughing Ive had my turn at
them I used to lie awake nights trying to remember what my lawyers
had told me to forget

PLIMP Ahem Ahem Yes a rather cynical jest I cant say exactly

MRS IS In doorway right Ah Mr Plimpton How do you do And Mr
Rutherford

PLIMP Good evening Mrs Isman

RUTH Good evening Mrs Isman

MRS IS You managed to tear yourself away from business cares after
all

PLIMP It was not easy I assure you

MRS IS Wont you come in

RUTH With pleasure

HICKS After waiting What shall I tell him sir

HAGEN You are surprised to see me

GER I confess that I am

HAGEN Did you think I was never coming back

GER I had given you up

HAGEN Well here I am to report progress

GER After a pause Where have you been these two years

HAGEN Oh Ive been seeing life

GER You didnt like the boarding school

HAGEN With sudden vehemence Did you think I would like it Did
you think Id come to this world to have my head stuffed with Latin
conjugations and sawdust

GER I had hoped that in a good Christian home

HAGEN Laughing No no Gerald I let you talk that sort of thing
to me in the beginning It sounded fishy even then but I didnt say
anything I wanted to get my bearings But I hadnt been twentyfour
hours in that good Christian home before I found out what a kettleful of
jealousies and hatreds it was The head master was an old saphead and
the boys I was strange and ugly and they thought they could torment
and bully me but I fought em by the Lord I fought em day and
night I fought em all around the place And when Id mastered em you
should have seen how they cringed and toadied They hated the slavery
they lived under but not one of them dared raise his hand against it

GER Well youve seen the world in your own way Now are you ready to
go back to Nibelheim

HAGEN Good God no

GER You know its my duty to send you back

HAGEN Oh say My dear fellow

GER You know the solemn promise I made to King Alberich

HAGEN Yes but you cant carry it out

GER But I can

HAGEN How

GER I could invoke the law if need be You know you are a minor

HAGEN My dear boy Im over seven hundred years old

GER Ah but that is a quibble You know that in our world that is only
equal to about eighteen

HAGEN I have read up the law but I havent found any provision for
reducing Nibelung ages to your scale

GER But you cant deny

HAGEN I wouldnt need to deny The storys absurd on the face of it
You know perfectly well that there are no such things as Nibelungs
GERALD gasps And besides youre a poet and everybody knows youre
crazy Fancy what the newspaper reporters would do with such a yarn
Cheerfully Come old man forget about it and lets be friends
Youll have a lot more fun watching my career And besides what do you
want Ive come back and Im ready to follow your advice

GER How do you mean

HAGEN You told me to stay in school until Id got my bearings in the
world And then I was to have a career Well Ive got my education for
myself and now Im ready for the career After a pause Listen
Gerald I said Id be a selfmade man I said Id conquer the world for
myself But of late Ive come to realize how far it is to the top and I
cant spare the time

GER I see

HAGEN And then besides that Ive met a woman

GER Startled Good heavens

HAGEN Yes Im in love

GER But surely you dont expect to marry

HAGEN Why not My mother was an earthwoman and her mother also

GER To be sure Id not realized it A pause Who is the woman

HAGEN I dont know I only know she belongs in this world of yours And
Ive come to seek her out I shall get her never fear

GER What are your plans

HAGEN Ive looked this Christian civilization of yours over and Im
prepared to play the game You can take me up and put me into Society
as you offered to do before Youll find that Ill do you credit

GER But such a career requires money

HAGEN Of course Alberich will furnish it if you tell him its needed
You must call Mimi

GER Mimi is here now

HAGEN Starting What

GER He is in the house

HAGEN For what

GER He came to look for you

HAGEN What is the matter

GER I dont know He wants you to return to Nibelheim

HAGEN Find him Let me see him

GER All right Wait here

Exit left

HAGEN What can that mean

EST Enters right sees PRINCE HAGEN starts wildly and screams Ah
She stands transfixed a long pause Steve OHagen A pause Steve

HAGEN In a transport of amazement Estelle Isman You are Geralds
sister

EST Yes

HAGEN By the gods

EST You Steve OHagen

HAGEN Gravely I am Prince Hagen

EST Prince Hagen

HAGEN A foreign nobleman

EST What what do you mean You were on the Bowery

HAGEN I came to this country to study its institutions I wished to
know them for myself therefore I went into politics Dont you see

EST Dazed I see

HAGEN Now I am on the point of giving up the game and telling the story
of my experiences

EST What are you doing here in this house

HAGEN I came for you

EST Stares at him How dare you

HAGEN I would dare anything for you They gaze at each other Dont
you understand

EST Vehemently No No I am afraid of you You have no business to

HAGEN Taking a step towards her Listen

EST No I will not hear you You cannot come here

Stares at him then abruptly exit centre

HAGEN Laughs Humph Hearing voices Who is this

RUTH Off right I dont agree with you

IS Nor I either Plimpton Enters with PLIMPTON and RUTHERFORD sees
HAGEN Oh I beg your pardon

HAGEN I am waiting for your son Sir

IS I see Wont you be seated

HAGEN I thank you Sits at ease in chair

PLIM My point is its as Lord Alderdyce says we have no hereditary
aristocracy in this country no traditions of authority  nothing to
hold the mob in check

IS There is the constitution

PLIM They may override it

IS There are the courts

PLIM They may defy the courts

RUTH Oh Plimpton thats absurd

PLIM Nothing of the kind Rutherford Suppose they were to elect
to office some wild and reckless demagog take for instance that
ruffian you were telling us about down there on the Bowery HAGEN
starts and listens and he were to defy the law and the courts He is
preaching just that to the mob striving to rouse the elemental wild
beast in them And some day they will pour out into this avenue

RUTH Vehemently Very well Plimpton Let them come Have we not the
militia and the regulars We could sweep the avenue with one machine
gun

PLIM But suppose the troops would not fire

RUTH But that is impossible

PLIM Nothing of the kind Rutherford No no we must go back of all
that It is in the hearts of the people that we must erect our defenses
It is the spirit of this godless and skeptical age that is undermining
order We must teach the people the truths of religion We must
inculcate lessons of sobriety and thrift of reverence for constituted
authority We must set our faces against these new preachers of license
and infidelity we must go back to the oldtime faith to love and
charity and selfsacrifice

HAGEN Interrupting Thats it Youve got it there

IS Amazed Why

PLIM Sir

HAGEN Youve said it Set the parsons after them Teach them heaven
Set them to singing about harps and golden crowns and milk and honey
flowing Then you can shut them up in slums and starve them and
they wont know the difference Teach them nonresistance and
selfrenunciation Youve got the phrases all pat handed out from
heaven direct Take no thought saying what ye shall eat Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on earth Render unto Caesar the things that are
Caesars

IS Why this is preposterous

PLIM This is blasphemy

HAGEN Youre Plimpton Plimpton the coal baron I take it I know
you by your pictures You shut up little children by tens of thousands
to toil for you in the bowels of the earth You crush your rivals and
form a trust and screw up prices to freeze the poor in winter And
you to RUTHERFORD youre Rutherford the steel king I take it
You have slaves working twelve hours a day and seven days a week in your
mills And you mangle them in hideous accidents and then cheat their
widows of their rights and then you build churches and set your
parsons to preach to them about love and selfsacrifice To teach them
charity while you crucify justice To trick them with visions of an
imaginary paradise while you pick their pockets upon earth To put arms
in their hands and send them to shoot their brothers in the name of
the Prince of Peace

RUTH This is outrageous

PLIM Clenching his fists Infamous scoundrel

RUTH Advancing Upon HAGEN How dare you

HAGEN It stings does it Ha Ha

PLIM Sputtering You wretch

IS This has gone too far Stop Rutherford Calm yourself Plimpton
Let us not forget ourselves To PRINCE HAGEN haughtily I do not know
who you are sir or by what right you are in my house You say that you
are a friend of my sons

HAGEN I claim that honor sir

IS The fact that you claim it prevents my ordering you into the street
But I will see my son sir and find out by what right you are here to
insult my guests Turning Come Plimpton Come Rutherford  we
will bandy no words with him

They go off centre

HAGEN Alone By God I touched them Ha ha ha Grimly He will
order me into the street With concentrated fury That is it
They shut you out They build a wall about themselves Aristocracy
Clenching his fast Very well So be it You sit within your fortress
of privilege You are haughty and contemptuous flaunting your power
But Ill breach your battlements Ill lay them in the dust Ill bring
you to your knees before me

A silence Suddenly there is heard very faintly the Nibelung theme
It is repeated HAGEN starts

MIMI Enters left Prince Hagen

HAGEN Mimi

MIMI At last

HAGEN Approaching What is it

MIMI Beckons Come here

HAGEN In excitement What do you want

MIMI You must come back

HAGEN What do you mean

MIMI The people want you

HAGEN What for

MIMI They need you You must be king

HAGEN Wildly Ha

MIMI Alberich

HAGEN Alberich

MIMI He is dead

HAGEN With wild start Dead

MIMI Yes he died last night

HAGEN Turns pale and staggers then leaps at Mimi clutching him by
the arm No NO

MIMI It is true

HAGEN My God A look of wild drunken rapture crosses his face he
clenches his hands and raises his arms Ha ha ha

MIMI Shrinks in horror Prince Hagen

HAGEN He is dead He is dead Leaps at mimi The gold

MIMI The gold is yours

HAGEN Ha ha ha It is mine It is mine Begins pacing the floor
wildly Victory Victory VICTORY Ha ha ha Ha ha ha Spreads out
his arms with a triumphant shout I have them By God Isman Plimpton
and Rutherford Estelle I have them all It is triumph It is glory It
is the world I am King I am King King KING Seizes MIMI and starts
centre the music rises to climax To Nibelheim To Nibelheim Stands
stretching out his arms in exultation a wild burst of music Make way
for Hagen Make way for Hagen

LORD A To be sure I did anyway

GER Gazing about Think of buying all the old Vandergrift palaces at

LORD A Dont mention it Dont mention it Ive invested all my funds
in this country and I tremble to pick up the last edition of the paper

MRS IS Enters right costumed en grande dame much excited Oh
Gerald Lord Alderdyce what do you think Ive just heard

LORD A What

MRS IS About Prince Hagen and Mrs BagleyWillis how she came to
take him up Percy Pennington told me about it hes her own first
cousin you know Lord Alderdyce and he vows he saw the letter in her
desk

LORD A Oh tell us

MRS IS Well it was just after Prince Hagen made his appearance when
the papers were printing pages about him And the news came that hed
bought these palaces and the next day Mrs BagleyWillis got a letter
marked personal Percy quoted the words Dear Madam I wish to enter
Society I have no time to go through with the usual formalities I am
a nobleman with an extraordinary mind and unlimited money I intend to
entertain New York Society as it has never dreamed of being entertained
before I should be very pleased if you would cooperate with me in
making my opening ball a success If you are prepared to do this I am
prepared to pay you the sum of one million dollars cash as soon as I
receive your acceptance Needless to say of course this proposition is
entirely confidential

LORD A By jove

MRS IS Think of it

GER But can it be true

MRS IS What is more likely my dear You know that Mrs BagleyWillis
has been spending millions every season to entertain at Newport
and their fortune will never stand that Oh I must give it to Van
Tribber hell see that the papers have it

LORD A But hadnt you better make sure that its really

MRS IS It doesnt make the slightest difference Everybody will know
that its true

GER They are ready to believe anything about Prince Hagen

MRS IS Certainly after a glimpse of this palace Did you ever see
such frantic moneyspending in your life

LORD A Never

MRS IS Gold Gold I am positively blinded with the sight of gold Id
seen every kind of decoration and furniture I thought but solid gold
is new to me

LORD A Just look at this cup for instance Points to coronation cup
And those fountains I believe that even the basins are of gold

MRS IS Perhaps we could stop the water and see

LORD A I must go I have a dance I am sorry not to see your
daughter

MRS IS Yes it was too bad she couldnt come Goodbye LORD
ALDERDYCE exit

MRS IS Pointing to throne Look at that thing Gerald

GER Yes no wonder the crowd came

MRS IS I imagine a good many came because they didnt dare stay away
They certainly cant be enjoying themselves after such a day down town

GER It was too bad the panic should come just on the eve of the ball

MRS IS My dear Gerald Thats his sense of humor He wanted to bring
them here and set them to dancing and grinning while in their hearts
they are frightened to death

GER How did he do it anyway

MRS IS Why he seems to have money without limit and hes been
buying and buying everything in sight You know how prices have been
soaring the past two months And of course the public went wild and
took to speculating Then Prince Hagen sold and the bottom has simply
dropped out of everything

GER I see And do you suppose the slump has hit father

MRS IS I dont know He wont talk to me about it But its easy to
see how distressed he is And then to cap the climax Estelle refuses
to come here Prince Hagen is certain to be furious

GER For my part I admire her courage

MRS IS But Gerald we cant afford to defy this man

GER Estelle can afford it I hope

MRS IS Here comes your father now Look at him Gerald wont you go
please I want to have a talk with him

months ago I offered you a business alliance

IS I had no idea of your resources then Had I known I should not have
rejected your offer Am I being punished for that

HAGEN No Isman it isnt punishment Had you gone into the alliance
with me it would have been just the same It was my purpose to get you
into my power

IS Dismayed But she will not be ready

HAGEN Tell her to come Whatever she is wearing she will outshine them

half dazed the other watches him laughing silently to himself Thats
all right Sees Calkins Ah Calkins

CALKINS Enters with an armful of papers Here are the morning papers
Prince

HAGEN Ah Takes them Still moist Did you think I wanted them that
badly

CAL Promptness never harms

HAGEN Opening papers Thats true Ah they hardly knew which was
more important the ball or the panic We filled them up pretty full
Did you see if they followed the proofs

CAL There are no material changes

HAGEN Ha Ha Cartoons Prince Hagen invites the Four Hundred with

todays

GER Whats the end of it all

HAGEN The end Why have an end I didnt make this game I play it
according to other mens rules I buy and sell stocks and make what
money I can The end may take care of itself

GER Its rather hard on the helpless people isnt it

HAGEN Humph The people After a pause Gerald this world of yours
has always seemed to me like a barrel full of rats Theres only room
for a certain number on top and the rest must sweat for it till they
die

GER Its not a very pleasant image to think of

HAGEN I dont think of it I simply happen to find myself on top and I
stay there and enjoy the view Seats himself at table As a matter
of fact Gerald one of the things I intend to do with this world is to
clean it up Dont imagine that I will tolerate such stupid waste as we
have at present everybody trying to cheat everybody else and nobody
to keep the streets clean Its as if a dozen mere should go out into a
field to catch a horse and spend all their time in trying to keep each
other from catching it When I take charge theyll catch the horse

GER Drily And youll ride him

HAGEN And Ill ride him Laughs

GER After a pause At first I couldnt make out why you bothered with
this Society game Now I begin to understand You wanted to see them

HAGEN I wanted to watch them wriggle I wanted to take them one by
one and strip off their shams Take that fellow Rutherford the steel
man Or Plimpton the coal baron casting his eyes up to heaven and
singing psalms through his nose The instant I laid eyes on that whining
old hypocrite I hated him and I vowed Id never rest again till Id
shown him as he is a coward and a knave And I tell you Gerald
before I get through with him Ah there he is

PLIM Off Hello Isman

HAGEN Come Draws back with GERALD

RUTH Hes a fiend A fiend

PLIM He smiled as he shook my hand and he knows that if coal stocks
go down another ten points Ill be utterly ruined

IS Terrible Terrible

PLIM To RUTHERFORD Rutherford have you learned any more about where
his money comes from

RUTH I meant to tell you Ive had another report The mystery
deepens every hour Its always the same thing the man takes a train
and goes out into the country he gathers all the wagons for miles
around and goes to some place in the woods and there is a pile of
gold fifty tons of it maybe covered over with brush Nobody knows how
it got there nobody has time to ask He loads it into the wagons takes
it aboard the train and brings it to the Subtreasury

IS The mans an alchemist Hes been manufacturing it and getting
ready

RUTH Perhaps Who can tell All I know is the Subtreasury has bought
over two billion dollars worth of gold bullion in the last four
months and what can we do in the face of that

PLIM No wonder that prices went up to the skies

RUTH I had the White House on the phone this afternoon We can
demonetize gold the government can refuse to buy any more

IS But then what would become of credit

PLIM Vehemently No no that will not help Gazes about
nervously Theres only one thing Whispers That man must be killed

RUTH Horrified Ah

IS No

PLIM Just that Nothing else will help And instantly or it will be
too late

HAGEN Fixes his gaze on her and slowly leans across table with
intensity Havent you discovered yet that you are mine

EST Half rising Prince Hagen

HAGEN How long will it be before you know it

EST How dare you

HAGEN Listen I am a man accustomed to command I have no time to play
with conventions I cannot dally and plead But I love you I cannot
live without you And I will shake the foundations of the world to get
you

EST Staring fascinated whispers Prince Hagen

HAGEN All this waving his hand I did in the hope that it would
bring you here so that I might have a chance to tell you Simply for
that one purpose I have broken the business world to my will that
also was to make you mine

EST Wildly You have ruined my father

HAGEN Your father has played this game and his path is strewn with the
rivals he has ruined He knows that and you know it Now I have played
the game and I have beaten him It took me one day to bring him down
Laughs It will take me less time to put him back again

EST But why why

HAGEN Listen Estelle I came to this civilization of yours and looked
at it It seemed to me that it was built upon knavery and fraud  that
it was altogether a vile thing rotten to the core of it And I said
I would smash it as a child smashes a toy I would toss it about as
your brother the poet tosses his metaphors But then I saw you and in a
flash all that was changed You were beautiful you were interesting
You were something in the world worth winning something I had not
known about before But you stood upon the pinnacle of Privilege you
gathered the clouds about your head How should I climb to you

EST Frightened I see

HAGEN I came to your home I was turned from the door So I set to
work to break my way to you

EST I see

HAGEN And that is how I love you You are all there is in the game to
me I bring the world and lay it at your feet It is all yours You do
not like what I do with it perhaps Very well take it and do better
The power is yours for the asking Power without end He reaches
out his arms to her a pause You do not like my way of lovemaking
perhaps You find me harsh and rude But I love you And where among
the men that you know will you find one who can feel for you what I
feel who would dare for you what I have dared Gazes at her with
intensity Take your time I have no wish to hurry you But you must
know that wherever you go my hand is upon you All that I do I do for
the love of you

EST Weakly I you frighten me

HAGEN All the world I lay at your feet You shall see

PLIM Off left Prince Hagen

HAGEN Starting Ah

PLIM Enters running in great agitation with a telegram Prince
Hagen

HAGEN Well

PLIM I have a report from London The market has gone all to pieces

HAGEN Ah

hour Im lost everything is lost

RUTH Running on Prince Hagen Steel is down to four And the Bank of
England suspends payments What

RUTH Wildly Youve crushed us Were helpless utterly helpless

PLIM Have you no mercy Arent you satisfied when youve got us down

RUTH Are you going to ruin everybody Are you a madman

PLIM What are you trying to do What do you want

HAGEN Has been listening in silence Suddenly he leaps into action an
expression of furious rage coming upon his face His eyes gleam and he
raises his hand as if to strike the two Get down on your knees

PLIM Ha

RUTH What

HAGEN Louder Get down on your knees PLIMPTON sinks in horror
PRINCE HAGEN turns Upon RUTHERFORD Down

RUTH Sinking Mercy

HAGEN As they kneel before him his anger vanishes he steps back
There Waving his hand You asked me what I wanted I wanted this 
to see you there upon your knees To spectators who appear right
and left Behold

RUTH Oh Starts to rise

HAGEN Savagely Stay where you are To see you on your knees To
hear you crying for mercy which you will not get You pious plunderers
Devourers of the people Assassins of women and helpless children
Who made the rules of this game you or I Who cast the halo of
righteousness about it who sanctified it by the laws of God and man
Property Property was holy Property must rule You carved it into your
constitutions you taught it in your newspapers you preached it from
your pulpits You screwed down wages you screwed up prices it must
be right because it paid Money was the test money was the end
You were business men Practical men Dont you know the phrases Money
talks Business is business The gold standard ha ha ha The gold
standard Now someone has come who has more gold than you You were
masters now I am the master And what you have done to the people
I will do to you You shall drink the cup that you have poured out for
them you shall drink it to the dregs

PLIM Starting to rise Monster

HAGEN Stay where you are Cringe and grovel and whine Draws a
Nibelung whip from under his coat I will put the lash upon your backs
I will strip your shams from you I will see you as you are I will
take away your wealth that you have wrung from others Before I get
through with you you shall sweat with the toilers in the trenches For
I am the master now I have the gold I own the property The world
is mine You were lords and barons you ruled in your little
principalities But I shall rule everywhere everything all
civilization I shall be king King With exultant gesture Make way
for the king Make way for the king

each side To the left of centre is a spacious stone fireplace having
within it a trap door opening downward At the left a piano with a

At rise CALKINS standing by the desk arranging some papers

CALKINS As phone rings Hello Yes this is the Isman camp Prince
Hagen is staying here This is his secretary speaking No Prince
Hagen does not receive telephone calls No not under any circumstances
whatever It doesnt make any difference If the President of the United
States has anything to say to Prince Hagen let him communicate with
Mr Isman at his New York office and the message will reach him I am
sorry those are my instructions Goodbye To HICKS who enters with
telegram Hicks for the future Prince Hagen wishes all messages for
him to be taken to my office That applies to letters telegrams
everything

HICKS Very good sir Exit

CAL Opening a telegram More appeals for mercy

HAGEN Enters from veranda wearing white flannels cool and alert
Well Calkins

CAL Nothing important sir

HAGEN The market continues to fall

CAL Copper is off five points sir

HAGEN Ah

CAL The President of the United States tried to get you on the phone
just now

HAGEN Humph Anything else

CAL There has been another mob on Fifth Avenue this morning They seem
to be threatening your palace

HAGEN I see You wrote to the mayor as I told you

CAL Yes sir

HAGEN Well youd best put in another hundred guards And theyre to be
instructed to shoot

CAL Yes sir

HAGEN Let them be men we can depend on I dont want any mistake

CAL Ill see to it sir

HAGEN Anything else

CAL A message from a delegation from the National Unemployment
Conference They are to call tomorrow morning

HAGEN Ah yes Make a note please I sympathize with their purpose
and contribute half a million To GERALD who enters left Hello
Gerald how are you Make yourself at home To CALKINS I attribute
the present desperate situation to the anarchical struggles of rival
financial interests I am assuming control and straightening out the
tangle as rapidly as I can The worst of the crisis is over the
opposition is capitulating and I expect soon to order a general
resumption of industry Prepare me an address of five hundred words
sharp and snappy Then see the head of the delegation and have it
understood that the affair is not to occupy more than fifteen minutes

CAL Very good sir

HAGEN And stir up our Press Bureau We must have strong conservative
editorials this week Its the crucial period Our institutions are at
stake the national honor is imperilled order must be preserved at
any hazard all that sort of thing

CAL Yes sir I understand

HAGEN Very good That will be all

CAL Yes sir

Exit right

GER Youre putting the screws on are you

HAGEN Humph Yes Its funny to hear these financial men their
one idea in life has been to dominate and now they cry out against
tyranny

GER I can imagine it

HAGEN Heres Plimpton making speeches about American democracy These
fellows have got so used to making pretenses that they actually deceive
themselves

GER Ive noticed that you make a few yourself now

HAGEN Yes dont I do it well Thoughtfully You know Gerald
pretenses are the greatest device that your civilization had to teach
me

GER Indeed

HAGEN We never made any pretenses in Nibelheim and when I first met
you your talk about virtue and morality and selfsacrifice was simply
incomprehensible to me It seemed something quite apart from life But
now Ive come to perceive that this is what makes possible the system
under which you live

GER Explain yourself

HAGEN Here is this civilization simply appalling in its vastness
The countless millions of your people the wealth you have piled up
it seems like a huge bubble that may burst any minute And the one
device by which it is all kept together is pretense

GER Why do you think that

HAGEN Life Gerald is the survival of the strong I care not if it be
in a jungle or in a city it is the warfare of each against all But in
the former case its brute force and in the latter its power of mind
And dont you see that the ingenious device which makes the animal of
the slums the docile slave of the man who can outwit him  is this
Morality this absolutely sublimest invention this most daring
conception that ever flashed across the mind of man

GER Oh I see

HAGEN I used to wonder at it down there on the Bowery The poor are
a thousand to your one and the best that is might be theirs if they
chose to take it but there is Morality They call it their virtue And
so the rich man may have his vices in peace By heaven if that is not a
wondrous achievement I have not seen one

GER You believe this morality was invented by the rich

HAGEN I dont know It seems to be a congenital disease

GER Some people believe it was implanted in man by God

HAGEN Shrugging his shoulders Perhaps Or by a devil Men might have
lived in holes like woodchucks and been fat and happy but now they
have Morality and toil and die for some other mans delight

CAL Enters right Are you at leisure sir

HAGEN Why

CAL Mr Isman wants you on the phone

HAGEN Oh All right Goes to phone

GER Rises Perhaps I

HAGEN No thats all right Sits at phone Hello Is that Isman How
are you To CALKINS Calkins

CAL Yes sir

Sits and takes notes

HAGEN How about Intercontinental Imperiously But I can I said the
stock was to go to sixtyfour and I want it to go I dont care what
it costs Isman let it go in the morning and dont ever let this
happen again I have sent word you are to have another hundred million
by ninethirty Will that do Dont take chances Oh Rutherford
Tell Rutherford my terms are that the directors of the Fidelity Life
Insurance Company are to resign and he is to go to China for six
months Yes I mean that literally Plimpton What do I want with his
banks Ive got my own money And oh by the way Isman call up
the White House again and tell the President that the regulars will
be needed in New York No I understand you I think Ive fixed
matters up at this end Ive got two hundred guards up here and theyre
picked men theyll shoot if theres need Im not talking about it
naturally but Im taking care of myself You keep your nerve Isman
Itll all be over in a month or two more these fellows are used to
having their own way and they make a fuss And by the way as to the
newspapers well turn out that paper trust crowd and stop selling
paper to the ones that are making trouble Thatll put an end to it
I fancy You had best get after it yourself and have it attended to
promptly You might think of little things like that yourself Isman
no youre all right only you havent got enough imagination But
just get onto this job and let me hear that its done before morning
Goodbye Hangs up receiver Humph To GERALD Theyve about got
your fathers nerve

GER I cant say that I blame him very much In somber thought
Really you know Prince Hagen this cant go on Whats to be the end
of it

HAGEN Laughing Oh come come Gerald dont bother your head with
things like that Youre a poet you must keep your imagination free
from such dismal matters See Ive got a job for you Pointing to
books on table Do you notice the titles

GER Has been handling the books absentmindedly now looks at titles
The Saints Everlasting Rest Pilgrims Progress The Life of St
Ignatius What does that mean

HAGEN Im studying up on religion I want to know the language

GER I See

HAGEN But I dont seem to get hold of it very well I think its the
job for you

GER How do you mean

HAGEN Im getting ready to introduce Morality into Nibelheim

GER What

HAGEN Playfully You remember you talked to me about it a long time
ago And now Ive come to your way of thinking Suppose I gave you a
chance to civilize the place to teach those wretched creatures to love
beauty and virtue

GER It would depend upon what your motive was in inviting me

HAGEN My Motive What has that to do with it Virtue is virtue is it
not No matter what I think about it

GER Yes

HAGEN And virtue is its own reward

GER Perhaps so

HAGEN Let us grant that the consequences of educating and elevating
the Nibelungs of teaching them to love righteousness would be that
they were deprived of all their gold and forced to labor at getting
more for a wicked capitalist like me Would it not still be right to
teach them

GER It might perhaps

HAGEN Then you will try it

GER No Im afraid not

HAGEN Why not

GER Gravely Well for one thing I have weighty reasons for
doubting the perfectibility of the Nibelungs

HAGEN Gazes at him then shakes with laughter Really Gerald that
is the one clever thing Ive heard you say

GER Laughing Thank you

HAGEN Rises and looks at watch Your mother was coming down Ah Mrs
Isman

MRS IS Enters left Good afternoon Prince Hagen

HAGEN And how go things

MRS IS Ive just had a telegram from my brother He says that the
Archbishop of Canterbury never goes abroad and was shocked at the
suggestion but he thinks two million might fetch him

HAGEN Very well offer it

MRS IS Do you really think its worth that

HAGEN My dear lady it is worth anything if it will make you happy and
add to the eclat of the wedding Theres nothing too good for Estelle

MRS IS Ah what a wonderful man you are Eyeing him I was wondering

HAGEN Dear me Am I to wear rose pink

MRS IS No but Im planning the decoration for the wedding breakfast
 And Im puzzled about the flowers Im weary of orchids and la
France roses Mrs BagleyWillis had her ball room swamped with them
last week

HAGEN We must certainly not imitate Mrs BagleyWillis

MRS IS Complacently I fancy shes pretty nearly at the end of her
rope My maid tells me she couldnt pay her grocers bill till she got
that million from you

HAGEN Ha ha ha

MRS IS I wish youd come with me for a moment I have some designs
for the breakfast menu

HAGEN Delighted Im sure They go off left

GER Oh my God

EST Enters in a beautiful afternoon gown and carrying an armful of
roses she is nervous and preoccupied Ah Gerald

GER Estelle He watches her in silence she arranges flowers

EST How goes the poem Gerald

GER The poem Who could think of a poem at a time like this Advancing
toward her Estelle I can bear it no longer

EST What

GER This crime I tell you its a crime youre committing

EST Oh Gerald Dont begin that again You know its too late And it
tears me to pieces

GER I cant help it I must say it

EST Hurrying toward him Brother You must not say another word to

GER Estelle

EST No I say no Ive given my word My honor is pledged and its
too late to turn back I have permitted father to incur obligations
before all the world

GER But Estelle you dont know If you understood all all

EST With sudden intensity Gerald I know what you mean I have felt
it You know more about Prince Hagen than you have told me There is
some secretsomething strange She stares at him wildly I dont want
to know it Gerald dont you understand We are in that mans hands
We are at his mercy Dont you know that he would never give me up He
would follow me to the end of the earth He would wreck the whole world
to get me I am in a cage with a wild beast

They stare at each other

GER In sudden excitement Estelle

EST What

GER Can it be that you love this man

EST Startled I dont know How can I tell He terrifies me He
fascinates me I dont know what to make of him And I dont dare to
think Wildly And what difference does it make I have promised to
marry him

MRS ISMAN enters left and listens

EST And I must keep my word You must not try to dissuade me

MRS IS Estelle

EST Mother

MRS IS Has Gerald been tormenting you again My child my child 
I implore you dont let that madness take hold of you Think of our
position Attempts to embrace her I know how it is I went through
with it myself We women all have to go through with it I did not care
for your father it nearly broke my heart I was madly in love at the
time truly I was But think what will become of us

EST Vehemently pushing her away Mother I forbid you to speak
another word to me I will not bear it I will keep my bargain I will
do what I have said I will do But I will not have you talk to me about
it Do you understand me

MRS IS My dear

EST Please go Both of you I wish to be alone

MRS IS In great agitation Oh dear me dear me

Exit left

GER Goodbye

thought Twilight has begun to gather

HAGEN Enters by veranda Ah Estelle Comes toward her My
beautiful Makes to embrace her Not yet

EST Faintly Prince Hagen I told you

HAGEN I know I know But how much longer I love you The sight of you
is fire in my veins Have I not been patient The time is very short
when will you let me

Advances

EST Gasping Give me give me till tomorrow

HAGEN Gripping his hands Tomorrow Very well Turns to table Ah
flowers Do you like the new poppies

EST They are exquisite

HAGEN Sits in chair Well weve had a busy day today

EST Yes You must be tired

HAGEN In your house No

EST Rest even so Goes to piano I will play for you Sits and
takes Rheingold score One of Geralds scores

Plays a little then sounds the Nibelung theme PRINCE HAGEN starts
She repeats it

HAGEN No no

EST Whywhats the matter

HAGEN That music What is it

EST Its some of the Nibelung music Gerald had it here

HAGEN Dont play it Hesitating Music jars on me now Ive too
much on my mind

EST Rising Oh very well It is time for tea anyway Have you
talked with father today

HAGEN Three times He is in the thick of the fight He plays the game
well

EST He has played it a long time

HAGEN Yes Phone rings Ah What is that Takes receiver Hello
Yes oh Isman I see More trouble in Fifth Avenue hey Well are
the regulars there Why dont they fire Women and children in front Do
they expect to accomplish anything by that No dont call me up about
matters like that Isman The orders have been given No not an
inch Let the orders be carried out That is all Goodbye Hangs up
receiver

EST Has been listening in terror Prince Hagen

HAGEN Well

EST What does that mean

HAGEN It means that the slums are pouring into Fifth Avenue

EST A pause What do they want

HAGEN Apparently they want to burn my palace

EST And the orders what are the orders

HAGEN The orders are to shoot and to shoot straight

EST Is it for me that you are doing this

HAGEN How do you mean

EST You told me you brought all the world and laid it at my feet Is
this part of the process

HAGEN Yes this is part

EST Stares at him intently whispers How do you do it

HAGEN What

EST What is the secret of your power They are millions and you are
only one yet you have them bound Is it some spell that you have
woven A pause HAGEN stares at her She goes on with growing
intensity and excitement They are afraid of your gold Afraid of your
gold All the world is afraid of it It is nothingit is a dream 
it is a nightmare If they would defy you if they would open their
eyes it would go as all nightmares go But you have made them believe
in it They cower and cringe before it They toil and slave for it They
take up arms and murder their brothers for it They sell their minds and
their souls for it And all because no one dares to defy you No one
No one In a sudden transport of passion I defy you PRINCE HAGEN
starts she gazes at him wildly I will not marry you I will not
sell myself to you Not for any price that you can offer not for any
threat that you can make Not in order that my mother may plan wedding
breakfasts and triumph over Mrs BagleyWillis Not in order that my
father may rule in Wall Street and command the slaughter of women and
children Nor yet for the fear of anything that you can do

HAGEN In a low voice Have you any idea what I will do

EST Desperately I know what you mean you have me at your mercy
You have your guardsI am in a trap And you mean force I have felt
it in all your actions behind all your words Very well There is a
way of escape even from that and I will take it You can compel me to
kill myself but you can never compel me to marry you Not with all the
power you can summon not with all the wealth of the world Do you
understand me They stare at each other I have heard you talk with my
brother and I know what are your ideas You came to our civilization
and tried it and found it a lie Virtue and honor justice and
mercy all these things were pretenses snares for the unwary There
was no one you could not frighten with your gold That is your creed
and so far it has served you but no farther There is one thing in
the world you cannot get one thing that is beyond the reach of all
your cunning And that is a womans soul With a gesture of exultant
triumph You cannot buy me

HAGEN Estelle

EST Go

HAGEN Stretching out his arms to her I love you

EST You love me The slave driver with his golden whip

HAGEN Even so I love you

EST What do you know of love What does the word mean to you
Before love must come justice and honor with it come mercy and
selfsacrifice all things that you deride and trample on What have
you to do with love

HAGEN With intensity I love you More than anything else in all the
world I love you

EST Stares at him More than your power

HAGEN Estelle Listen to me You do not know what my life has been But
I can say this for myself I have sought the best that I know I have
sought Reality A pause I seek your love I seek those things which
you have and which I have not Fiercely Do you think that I have not
felt the difference

EST In a startled whisper No

HAGEN That which you have and which I have not has become all the
world to me I love you I cannot live without you I will follow you
wherever you command Only teach me how to win your love

EST I cannot make terms with you I will not hear of love from you
while you have force in your hands

HAGEN I will leave your home I will set you free I will humble myself
before you What else can I do

EST You can lay down your power

HAGEN Estelle Those are mere words

EST No

HAGEN Who is to take up the power Shall I hand it back to those who
had it before Are Plimpton and Rutherford better fitted to wield it
than I

EST Vehemently Give it to the people

HAGEN The people Do you believe that in that mass of ignorance and
corruption which you call the people there is the power to rule the
world

EST What is it that has made the people corrupt What is it that has
kept them in ignorance What is it but your gold It lies upon them like
a mountains weight It crushes every aspiration for freedom every
effort after light Teach them help them then see if they cannot
govern themselves

HAGEN I meant to do it

EST Yes so does every rich man When only he has the time to think
of it When only his power is secure I have heard my father say it
a score of times But there are always new rivals to trample new foes
to fight new wrongs and horrors to be perpetrated The time to do it
is now NOW

HAGEN Estelle

CAL Enters hurriedly Prince Hagen

HAGEN What is it

CAL A message from Isman There is bad news from Washington

HAGEN Well

CAL A bill has been introduced in Congress it is expected to pass
both houses tonight your property is to be confiscated

HAGEN What

CAL The sources of natural wealth the land and the mines and the
railroads all are to become public property It is to take effect at
once

EST Pointing at him in exultation Aha It has come

They stare at each other

CAL I tried to get more information but I was cut off

HAGEN Cut off

CAL I think the wires are down I cant get any response

HAGEN I see Stands in deep thought laughs Well To ESTELLE At
least Plimpton and Rutherford are buried with me To CALKINS Send to
town at once and have the wires seen to And try to learn what you can

CAL Yes sir at once Exit

EST They have done it themselves you see

HAGEN Yes I see

GER Enters centre stands looking from one to the other Well
Prince Hagen it looks as if the game was up

HAGEN Youve heard the news

GER From Washington Yes And more than that Your guards have
revolted

HAGEN What Here

GER Yes Were prisoners of war it seems

EST Gerald

HAGEN How do you know

GER Theyve sent a delegation to tell us Theyve cut the telephone
wires blocked the roads and shut us in

HAGEN What do they want

GER They dont condescend to tell us that They simply inform us that
the woods are guarded and that anyone who tries to leave the camp will
be shot

EST In fright Prince Hagen

HAGEN stands motionless

GER Solemnly Hagen the game is up

HAGEN In deep thought Yes The game is up A pause Gerald

GER Well

HAGEN Points to violin Play

GER Startled No

HAGEN Play

GER You will go

HAGEN Yes I will go But I will come back Play GERALD takes the
violin and plays the Nibelung theme Louder

GERALD plays the Nibelung music which is taken up by the orchestra and
mounts to a climax in the midst of which HAGEN pronounces a sort of
incantation

Mimi Mimi Open the gates of wonderland Bring back the mood of
phantasy and wake us from our evil dream

Silence Then answering echoes of the music are heard faintly from the
fireplace There are rappings and murmurings underground rumbling and
patter of feet and all the sounds of Nibelheim As the music swells
louder the trap doors slide open and MIMI appears amid steam and
glare of light ESTELLE sees him and recoils in terror A company of
Nibelungs emerge one by one They peer about timidly recognize HAGEN
and with much trepidation approach him MIMI clasps his hand and they
surround him with joyful cries He moves toward the fireplace and the
steam envelops him

EST Starts toward him stretching out her arms to him Prince Hagen

HAGEN Farewell

He gradually retires and disappears with the Nibelungs The orchestra
sounds the motive of Siegfried Triumphant
