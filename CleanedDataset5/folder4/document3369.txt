A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES

By William Dean Howells



PART FOURTH



I

Not long after Lent Fulkerson set before Dryfoos one day his scheme for
a dinner in celebration of the success of Every Other Week Dryfoos had
never meddled in any manner with the conduct of the periodical but
Fulkerson easily saw that he was proud of his relation to it and he
proceeded upon the theory that he would be willing to have this relation
known On the days when he had been lucky in stocks he was apt to drop
in at the office on Eleventh Street on his way uptown and listen to
Fulkersons talk He was on good enough terms with March who revised his
first impressions of the man but they had not much to say to each other
and it seemed to March that Dryfoos was even a little afraid of him as
of a piece of mechanism he had acquired but did not quite understand he
left the working of it to Fulkerson who no doubt bragged of it
sufficiently The old man seemed to have as little to say to his son he
shut himself up with Fulkerson where the others could hear the manager
begin and go on with an unstinted flow of talk about Every Other Week
for Fulkerson never talked of anything else if he could help it and was
always bringing the conversation back to it if it strayed

The day he spoke of the dinner he rose and called from his door March
I say come down here a minute will you Conrad I want you too

The editor and the publisher found the manager and the proprietor seated
on opposite sides of the table Its about those funeral baked meats
you know Fulkerson explained and I was trying to give Mr Dryfoos
some idea of what we wanted to do That is what I wanted to do he
continued turning from March to Dryfoos March here is opposed to it
of course Hed like to publish Every Other Week on the sly keep it
out of the papers and off the newsstands hes a modest Boston petunia
and he shrinks from publicity but I am not that kind of herb myself and
I want all the publicity we can getbeg borrow or stealfor this
thing I say that you cant work the sacred rites of hospitality in a
better cause and what I propose is a little dinner for the purpose of
recognizing the hit weve made with this thing My idea was to strike you
for the necessary funds and do the thing on a handsome scale The term
little dinner is a mere figure of speech A little dinner wouldnt make a
big talk and what we want is the big talk at present if we dont lay
up a cent My notion was that pretty soon after Lent now when everybody
is feeling just right we should begin to send out our paragraphs
affirmative negative and explanatory and along about the first of May
we should sit down about a hundred strong the most distinguished people
in the country and solemnize our triumph There it is in a nutshell I
might expand and I might expound but thats the sum and substance of
it

Fulkerson stopped and ran his eyes eagerly over the faces of his three
listeners one after the other March was a little surprised when Dryfoos
turned to him but that reference of the question seemed to give
Fulkerson particular pleasure What do you think Mr March

The editor leaned back in his chair I dont pretend to have Mr
Fulkersons genius for advertising but it seems to me a little early
yet We might celebrate later when weve got more to celebrate At
present were a pleasing novelty rather than a fixed fact

Ah you dont get the idea said Fulkerson What we want to do with
this dinner is to fix the fact

Am I going to come in anywhere the old man interrupted

Youre going to come in at the head of the procession We are going to
strike everything that is imaginative and romantic in the newspaper soul
with you and your history and your fancy for going in for this thing I
can start you in a paragraph that will travel through all the newspapers
from Maine to Texas and from Alaska to Florida We have had all sorts of
rich men backing up literary enterprises but the naturalgas man in
literature is a new thing and the combination of your picturesque past
and your aesthetic present is something that will knock out the
sympathies of the American public the first round I feel said
Fulkerson with a tremor of pathos in his voice that Every Other Week
is at a disadvantage before the public as long as its supposed to be my
enterprise my idea As far as Im known at all Im known simply as a
syndicate man and nobody in the press believes that Ive got the money
to run the thing on a grand scale a suspicion of insolvency must attach
to it sooner or later and the fellows on the press will work up that
impression sooner or later if we dont give them something else to work
up Now as soon as I begin to give it away to the correspondents that
youre in it with your untold millionsthat in fact it was your idea
from the start that you originated it to give full play to the
humanitarian tendencies of Conrad here whos always had these theories
of cooperation and longed to realize them for the benefit of our
struggling young writers and artists

March had listened with growing amusement to the mingled burlesque and
earnest of Fulkersons selfsacrificing impudence and with wonder as to
how far Dryfoos was consenting to his preposterous proposition when
Conrad broke out Mr Fulkerson I could not allow you to do that It
would not be true I did not wish to be here andand what I thinkwhat
I wish to dothat is something I will not let any one put me in a false
position about No The blood rushed into the young mans gentle face
and he met his fathers glance with defiance

Dryfoos turned from him to Fulkerson without speaking and Fulkerson
said caressingly Why of course Coonrod I know how you feel and I
shouldnt let anything of that sort go out uncontradicted afterward But
there isnt anything in these times that would give us better standing
with the public than some hint of the way you feel about such things The
publics expects to be interested and nothing would interest it more than
to be told that the success of Every Other Week sprang from the first
application of the principle of Live and let Live to a literary
enterprise It would look particularly well coming from you and your
father but if you object we can leave that part out though if you
approve of the principle I dont see why you need object The main thing
is to let the public know that it owes this thing to the liberal and
enlightened spirit of one of the foremost capitalists of the country and
that his purposes are not likely to be betrayed in the hands of his son
I should get a little cut made from a photograph of your father and
supply it gratis with the paragraphs

I guess said the old man we will get along without the cut

Fulkerson laughed Well well Have it your own way But the sight of
your face in the patent outsides of the country press would be worth half
a dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and
breadth of this fair land

There was a fellow Dryfoos explained in an aside to March that was
getting up a history of Moffitt and he asked me to let him put a steel
engraving of me in He said a good many prominent citizens were going to
have theirs in and his price was a hundred and fifty dollars I told him
I couldnt let mine go for less than two hundred and when he said he
could give me a splendid plate for that money I said I should want it
cash You never saw a fellow more astonished when he got it through him
that I expected him to pay the two hundred

Fulkerson laughed in keen appreciation of the joke Well sir I guess
Every Other Week will pay you that much But if you wont sell at any
price all right we must try to worry along without the light of your
countenance on the posters but we got to have it for the banquet

I dont seem to feel very hungry yet said they old man dryly

Oh lappetit vient en mangeant as our French friends say Youll be
hungry enough when you see the preliminary Little Neck clam Its too
late for oysters

Doesnt that fact seem to point to a postponement till they get back
sometime in October March suggested

No no said Fulkerson you dont catch on to the business end of this
thing my friends Youre proceeding on something like the old exploded
idea that the demand creates the supply when everybody knows if hes
watched the course of modern events that its just as apt to be the
other way I contend that weve got a real substantial success to
celebrate now but even if we hadnt the celebration would do more than
anything else to create the success if we got it properly before the
public People will say Those fellows are not fools they wouldnt go
and rejoice over their magazine unless they had got a big thing in it
And the state of feeling we should produce in the public mind would make
a boom of perfectly unprecedented grandeur for E O W Heigh

He looked sunnily from one to the other in succession The elder Dryfoos
said with his chin on the top of his stick I reckon those Little Neck
clams will keep

Well just as you say Fulkerson cheerfully assented I understand you
to agree to the general principle of a little dinner

The smaller the better said the old man

Well I say a little dinner because the idea of that seems to cover the
case even if we vary the plan a little I had thought of a reception
maybe that would include the lady contributors and artists and the
wives and daughters of the other contributors That would give us the
chance to ring in a lot of society correspondents and get the thing
written up in firstclass shape Bytheway cried Fulkerson slapping
himself on the leg why not have the dinner and the reception both

I dont understand said Dryfoos

Why have a select little dinner for ten or twenty choice spirits of the
male persuasion and then about ten oclock throw open your palatial
drawingrooms and admit the females to champagne salads and ices It is
the very thing Come

What do you think of it Mr March asked Dryfoos on whose social
inexperience Fulkersons words projected no very intelligible image and
who perhaps hoped for some more light

Its a beautiful vision said March and if it will take more time to
realize it I think I approve I approve of anything that will delay Mr
Fulkersons advertising orgie

Then Fulkerson pursued we could have the pleasure of Miss Christine
and Miss Melas company and maybe Mrs Dryfoos would look in on us in
the course of the evening Theres no hurry as Mr March suggests if we
can give the thing this shape I will cheerfully adopt the idea of my
honorable colleague

March laughed at his impudence but at heart he was ashamed of Fulkerson
for proposing to make use of Dryfoos and his house in that way He
fancied something appealing in the look that the old man turned on him
and something indignant in Conrads flush but probably this was only his
fancy He reflected that neither of them could feel it as people of more
worldly knowledge would and he consoled himself with the fact that
Fulkerson was really not such a charlatan as he seemed But it went
through his mind that this was a strange end for all Dryfooss
moneymaking to come to and he philosophically accepted the fact of his
own humble fortunes when he reflected how little his money could buy for
such a man It was an honorable use that Fulkerson was putting it to in
Every Other Week it might be far more creditably spent on such an
enterprise than on horses or wines or women the usual resources of the
brute rich and if it were to be lost it might better be lost that way
than in stocks He kept a smiling face turned to Dryfoos while these
irreverent considerations occupied him and hardened his heart against
father and son and their possible emotions

The old man rose to put an end to the interview He only repeated I
guess those clams will keep till fall

But Fulkerson was apparently satisfied with the progress he had made and
when he joined March for the stroll homeward after office hours he was
able to detach his mind from the subject as if content to leave it

This is about the best part of the year in New York he said In some
of the areas the grass had sprouted and the tender young foliage had
loosened itself froze the buds on a sidewalk tree here and there the
soft air was full of spring and the delicate sky far aloof had the
look it never wears at any other season It aint a time of year to
complain much of anywhere but I dont want anything better than the
month of May in New York Farther South its too hot and Ive been in
Boston in May when that east wind of yours made every nerve in my body
get up and howl I reckon the weather has a good deal to do with the
local temperament The reason a New York man takes life so easily with
all his rush is that his climate dont worry him But a Boston man must
be rasped the whole while by the edge in his air That accounts for his
sharpness and when hes lived through twentyfive or thirty Boston Mays
he gets to thinking that Providence has some particular use for him or
he wouldnt have survived and that makes him conceited See

I see said March But I dont know how youre going to work that idea
into an advertisement exactly

Oh pahaw now March You dont think Ive got that on the brain all
the time

You were gradually leading up to Every Other Week somehow

No sir I wasnt I was just thinking what a different creature a
Massachusetts man is from a Virginian And yet I suppose theyre both as
pure English stock as youll get anywhere in America Marsh I think
Colonel Woodburns paper is going to make a hit

Youve got there When it knocks down the sale about onehalf I shall
know its made a hit

Im not afraid said Fulkerson That thing is going to attract
attention Its well writtenyou can take the pomposity out of it here
and there and its novel Our people like a bold strike and its going
to shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moral
grounds as the only solution of the labor problem You see in the first
place he goes for their sympathies by the way he portrays the actual
relations of capital and labor he shows how things have got to go from
bad to worse and then he trots out his little old hobby and proves that
if slavery had not been interfered with it would have perfected itself
in the interest of humanity He makes a pretty strong plea for it

March threw back his head and laughed Hes converted you I swear
Fulkerson if we had accepted and paid for an article advocating
cannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluous poor
youd begin to believe in it

Fulkerson smiled in approval of the joke and only said I wish you
could meet the colonel in the privacy of the domestic circle March
Youd like him Hes a splendid old fellow regular type Talk about
spring

You ought to see the widows little back yard these days You know that
glass gallery just beyond the diningroom Those girls have got the
potplants out of that and a lot more and theyve turned the edges of
that back yard along the fence into a regular bower theyve got sweet
peas planted and nasturtiums and we shall be in a blaze of glory about
the beginning of June Fun to see em work in the garden and the bird
bossing the job in his cage under the cherrytree Have to keep the
middle of the yard for the clothesline but six days in the week its a
lawn and I go over it with a mower myself March there aint anything
like a home is there Dear little cot of your own heigh I tell you
March when I get to pushing that mower round and the colonel is smoking
his cigar in the gallery and those girls are pottering over the flowers
one of these soft evenings after dinner I feel like a human being Yes
I do I struck it rich when I concluded to take my meals at the widows
For eight dollars a week I get good board refined society and all the
advantages of a Christian home Bytheway youve never had much talk
with Miss Woodburn have you March

Not so much as with Miss Woodburns father

Well he is rather apt to scoop the conversation I must draw his fire
sometime when you and Mrs March are around and get you a chance with
Miss Woodburn

I should like that better I believe said March

Well I shouldnt wonder if you did Curious but Miss Woodburn isnt at
all your idea of a Southern girl Shes got lots of go shes never idle
a minute she keeps the old gentleman in firstclass shape and she dont
believe a bit in the slavery solution of the labor problem says shes
glad its gone and if its anything like the effects of it shes glad
it went before her time No sir shes as full of snap as the liveliest
kind of a Northern girl None of that sunny Southern languor you read
about

I suppose the typical Southerner like the typical anything else is
pretty difficult to find said March But perhaps Miss Woodburn
represents the new South The modern conditions must be producing a
modern type

Well thats what she and the colonel both say They say there aint
anything left of that Walter Scott dignity and chivalry in the rising
generation takes too much time You ought to see her sketch the
oldschool highandmighty manners as they survive among some of the
antiques in Charlottesburg If that thing could be put upon the stage it
would be a killing success Makes the old gentleman laugh in spite of
himself But hes as proud of her as Punch anyway Why dont you and
Mrs March come round oftener Look here How would it do to have a
little excursion somewhere after the spring fairly gets in its work

Reporters present

No no Nothing of that kind perfectly sincere and disinterested
enjoyment

Oh a few handbills to be scattered around Buy Every Other Week Look
out for the next number of Every Other Week Every Other Week at all
the newsstands Well Ill talk it over with Mrs March I suppose
theres no great hurry

March told his wife of the idyllic mood in which he had left Fulkerson at
the widows door and she said he must be in love

Why of course I wonder I didnt think of that But Fulkerson is such
an impartial admirer of the whole sex that you cant think of his liking
one more than another I dont know that he showed any unjust partiality
though in his talk of those girls as he called them And I always
rather fancied that Mrs Mandelhes done so much for her you know and
she is such a wellbalanced wellpreserved person and so ladylike and
correct

Fulkerson had the word for her academic Shes everything that
instruction and discipline can make of a woman but I shouldnt think
they could make enough of her to be in love with

Well I dont know The academic has its charm There are moods in which
I could imagine myself in love with an academic person That regularity
of line that reasoned strictness of contour that neatness of pose that
slightly conventional but harmonious grouping of the emotions and
moralsyou can see how it would have its charm the Wedgwood in human
nature I wonder where Mrs Mandel keeps her urn and her willow

I should think she might have use for them in that family poor thing
said Mrs March

Ah that reminds me said her husband that we had another talk with
the old gentleman this afternoon about Fulkersons literary artistic
and advertising orgie and its postponed till October

The later the better I should think said Mrs March who did not
really think about it at all but whom the date fixed for it caused to
think of the intervening time We have got to consider what we will do
about the summer before long Basil

Oh not yet not yet he pleaded with that mans willingness to abide
in the present which is so trying to a woman Its only the end of
April

It will be the end of June before we know And these people wanting the
Boston house another year complicates it We cant spend the summer
there as we planned

They oughtnt to have offered us an increased rent they have taken an
advantage of us

I dont know that it matters said Mrs March I had decided not to go
there

Had you This is a surprise

Everything is a surprise to you Basil when it happens

True I keep the world fresh that way

It wouldnt have been any change to go from one city to another for the
summer We might as well have stayed in New York

Yes I wish we had stayed said March idly humoring a conception of
the accomplished fact Mrs Green would have let us have the gimcrackery
very cheap for the summer months and we could have made all sorts of
nice little excursions and trips off and been twice as well as if we had
spent the summer away

Nonsense You know we couldnt spend the summer in New York

I know I could

What stuff You couldnt manage

Oh yes I could I could take my meals at Fulkersons widows or at
Maronis with poor old Lindau hes got to dining there again Or I
could keep house and he could dine with me here

There was a teasing look in Marchs eyes and he broke into a laugh at
the firmness with which his wife said I think if there is to be any
housekeeping I will stay too and help to look after it I would try
not intrude upon you and your guest

Oh we should be only too glad to have you join us said March playing
with fire

Very well then I wish you would take him off to Maronis the next
time he comes to dine here cried his wife

The experiment of making Marchs old friend free of his house had not
given her all the pleasure that so kind a thing ought to have afforded so
good a woman She received Lindau at first with robust benevolence and
the high resolve not to let any of his little peculiarities alienate her
from a sense of his claim upon her sympathy and gratitude not only as a
man who had been so generously fond of her husband in his youth but a
hero who had suffered for her country Her theory was that his mutilation
must not be ignored but must be kept in mind as a monument of his
sacrifice and she fortified Bella with this conception so that the
child bravely sat next his maimed arm at table and helped him to dishes
he could not reach and cut up his meat for him As for Mrs March
herself the thought of his mutilation made her a little faint she was
not without a bewildered resentment of its presence as a sort of
oppression She did not like his drinking so much of Marchs beer
either it was no harm but it was somehow unworthy out of character
with a hero of the war But what she really could not reconcile herself
to was the violence of Lindaus sentiments concerning the whole political
and social fabric She did not feel sure that he should be allowed to say
such things before the children who had been nurtured in the faith of
Bunker Hill and Appomattox as the beginning and the end of all possible
progress in human rights As a woman she was naturally an aristocrat but
as an American she was theoretically a democrat and it astounded it
alarmed her to hear American democracy denounced as a shuffling evasion
She had never cared much for the United States Senate but she doubted if
she ought to sit by when it was railed at as a rich mans club It
shocked her to be told that the rich and poor were not equal before the
law in a country where justice must be paid for at every step in fees and
costs or where a poor man must go to war in his own person and a rich
man might hire someone to go in his Mrs March felt that this rebellious
mind in Lindau really somehow outlawed him from sympathy and
retroactively undid his past suffering for the country she had always
particularly valued that provision of the law because in forecasting all
the possible mischances that might befall her own son she had been
comforted by the thought that if there ever was another war and Tom were
drafted his father could buy him a substitute Compared with such
blasphemy as this Lindaus declaration that there was not equality of
opportunity in America and that fully onehalf the people were debarred
their right to the pursuit of happiness by the hopeless conditions of
their lives was flattering praise She could not listen to such things
in silence though and it did not help matters when Lindau met her
arguments with facts and reasons which she felt she was merely not
sufficiently instructed to combat and he was not quite gentlemanly to
urge I am afraid for the effect on the children she said to her
husband Such perfectly distorted ideasTom will be ruined by them

Oh let Tom find out where theyre false said March It will be good
exercise for his faculties of research At any rate those things are
getting said nowadays hell have to hear them sooner or later

Had he better hear them at home demanded his wife

Why you know as youre here to refute them Isabel he teased
perhaps its the best place But dont mind poor old Lindau my dear He
says himself that his parg is worse than his pidte you know

Ah its too late now to mind him she sighed In a moment of rash good
feeling or perhaps an exalted conception of duty she had herself
proposed that Lindau should come every week and read German with Tom and
it had become a question first how they could get him to take pay for it
and then how they could get him to stop it Mrs March never ceased to
wonder at herself for having brought this about for she had warned her
husband against making any engagement with Lindau which would bring him
regularly to the house the Germans stuck so and were so unscrupulously
dependent Yet the deed being done she would not ignore the duty of
hospitality and it was always she who made the old man stay to their
Sundayevening tea when he lingered near the hour reading Schiller and
Heine and Uhland with the boy in the clean shirt with which he observed
the day Lindaus linen was not to be trusted during the week She now
concluded a season of mournful reflection by saying He will get you
into trouble somehow Basil

Well I dont know how exactly I regard Lindau as a political
economist of an unusual type but I shall not let him array me against
the constituted authorities Short of that I think I am safe

Well be careful Basil be careful You know you are so rash

I suppose I may continue to pity him He is such a poor lonely old
fellow Are you really sorry hes come into our lives my dear

No no not that I feel as you do about it but I wish I felt easier
about himsure that is that were not doing wrong to let him keep on
talking so

I suspect we couldnt help it March returned lightly Its one of
what Lindau calls his brincibles to say what he thinks




II

The Marches had no longer the gross appetite for novelty which urges
youth to a surfeit of strange scenes experiences ideas and makes
travel with all its annoyances and fatigues an inexhaustible delight
But there is no doubt that the chief pleasure of their life in New York
was from its quality of foreignness the flavor of olives which once
tasted can never be forgotten The olives may not be of the first
excellence they may be a little stale and small and poor to begin
with but they are still olives and the fond palate craves them The
sort which grew in New York on lower Sixth Avenue and in the region of
Jefferson Market and on the soft exposures south of Washington Square
were none the less acceptable because they were of the commonest Italian
variety

The Marches spent a good deal of time and money in a grocery of that
nationality where they found all the patriotic comestibles and potables
and renewed their faded Italian with the friendly family in charge
Italian table dhotes formed the adventure of the week on the day when
Mrs March let her domestics go out and went herself to dine abroad with
her husband and children and they became adepts in the restaurants where
they were served and which they varied almost from dinner to dinner The
perfect decorum of these places and their immunity from offence in any
emboldened the Marches to experiment in Spanish restaurants where red
pepper and beans insisted in every dinner and where once they chanced
upon a night of olla podrida with such appeals to Marchs memory of a
boyish ambition to taste the dish that he became poetic and then pensive
over its cabbage and carrots peas and bacon For a rare combination of
international motives they prized most the table dhote of a French lady
who had taken a Spanish husband in a second marriage and had a Cuban
negro for her cook with a crosseyed Alsation for waiter and a slim
young SouthAmerican for cashier March held that something of the
catholic character of these relations expressed itself in the generous
and tolerant variety of the dinner which was singularly abundant for
fifty cents without wine At one very neat French place he got a dinner
at the same price with wine but it was not so abundant and March
inquired in fruitless speculation why the table dhote of the Italians a
notoriously frugal and abstemious people should be usually more than you
wanted at seventyfive cents and a dollar and that of the French rather
less at half a dollar He could not see that the frequenters were greatly
different at the different places they were mostly Americans of subdued
manners and conjecturably subdued fortunes with here and there a table
full of foreigners There was no noise and not much smoking anywhere
March liked going to that neat French place because there Madame sat
enthroned and high behind a comptoir at one side of the room and everybody
saluted her in going out It was there that a gentlelooking young
couple used to dine in whom the Marches became effectlessly interested
because they thought they looked like that when they were young The wife
had an aesthetic dress and defined her pretty head by wearing her
backhair pulled up very tight under her bonnet the husband had dreamy
eyes set wide apart under a pure forehead They are artists August I
think March suggested to the waiter when he had vainly asked about
them Oh hartis cedenly August consented but Heaven knows whether
they were or what they were March never learned

This immunity from acquaintance this touchand go quality in their New
York sojourn this almost loss of individuality at times after the
intense identification of their Boston life was a relief though Mrs
March had her misgivings and questioned whether it were not perhaps too
relaxing to the moral fibre March refused to explore his conscience he
allowed that it might be so but he said he liked now and then to feel
his personality in that state of solution They went and sat a good deal
in the softening evenings among the infants and dotards of Latin
extraction in Washington Square safe from all who ever knew them and
enjoyed the advancing season which thickened the foliage of the trees
and flattered out of sight the church wardens Gothic of the University
Building The infants were sometimes cross and cried in their weary
mothers or little sisters arms but they did not disturb the dotards
who slept some with their heads fallen forward and some with their
heads fallen back March arbitrarily distinguished those with the
drooping faces as tipsy and ashamed to confront the public The small
Italian children raced up and down the asphalt paths playing American
games of tag and hideandwhoop larger boys passed ball in training for
potential championships The Marches sat and mused or quarrelled
fitfully about where they should spend the summer like sparrows he once
said till the electric lights began to show distinctly among the leaves
and they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone and the
benches filled with lovers That was the signal for the Marches to go
home He said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eye might
take in there at a glance was not perhaps oppressive but the thought
that at the same hour the same thing was going on all over the country
wherever two young fools could get together was more than he could bear
he did not deny that it was natural and in a measure authorized but
he declared that it was hackneyed and the fact that it must go on
forever as long as the race lasted made him tired

At home generally they found that the children had not missed them and
were perfectly safe It was one of the advantages of a flat that they
could leave the children there whenever they liked without anxiety They
liked better staying there than wandering about in the evening with their
parents whose excursions seemed to them somewhat aimless and their
pleasures insipid They studied or read or looked out of the window at
the street sights and their mother always came back to them with a pang
for their lonesomeness Bella knew some little girls in the house but in
a ceremonious way Tom had formed no friendships among the boys at school
such as he had left in Boston as nearly as he could explain the New
York fellows carried canes at an age when they would have had them broken
for them by the other boys at Boston and they were both sissyish and
fast It was probably prejudice he never could say exactly what their
demerits were and neither he nor Bella was apparently so homesick as
they pretended though they answered inquirers the one that New York was
a hole and the other that it was horrid and that all they lived for was
to get back to Boston In the mean time they were thrown much upon each
other for society which March said was well for both of them he did not
mind their cultivating a little gloom and the sense of a common wrong it
made them better comrades and it was providing them with amusing
reminiscences for the future They really enjoyed Bohemianizing in that
harmless way though Tom had his doubts of its respectability he was
very punctilious about his sister and went round from his own school
every day to fetch her home from hers The whole family went to the
theatre a good deal and enjoyed themselves together in their desultory
explorations of the city

They lived near Greenwich Village and March liked strolling through its
quaintness toward the waterside on a Sunday when a hereditary
Sabbatarianism kept his wife at home he made her observe that it even
kept her at home from church He found a lingering quality of pure
Americanism in the region and he said the very bells called to worship
in a nasal tone He liked the streets of small brick houses with here
and there one painted red and the mortar lines picked out in white and
with now and then a fine wooden portal of fluted pillars and a bowed
transom The rear of the tenementhouses showed him the picturesqueness
of clotheslines fluttering far aloft as in Florence and the new
apartmenthouses breaking the old skyline with their towering stories
implied a life as alien to the American manner as anything in continental
Europe In fact foreign faces and foreign tongues prevailed in Greenwich
Village but no longer German or even Irish tongues or faces The eyes
and earrings of Italians twinkled in and out of the alleyways and
basements and they seemed to abound even in the streets where long
ranks of trucks drawn up in Sunday rest along the curbstones suggested
the presence of a race of sturdier strength than theirs March liked the
swarthy strange visages he found nothing menacing for the future in
them for wickedness he had to satisfy himself as he could with the
sneering insolent cleanshaven mug of some rare American of the bhoy
type now almost as extinct in New York as the dodo or the volunteer
fireman When he had found his way among the ashbarrels and the groups
of decently dressed churchgoers to the docks he experienced a
sufficient excitement in the recent arrival of a French steamer whose
sheds were thronged with hacks and expresswagons and in a tacit inquiry
into the emotions of the passengers fresh from the cleanliness of Paris
and now driving up through the filth of those streets

Some of the streets were filthier than others there was at least a
choice there were boxes and barrels of kitchen offal on all the
sidewalks but not everywhere manureheaps and in some places the stench
was mixed with the more savory smell of cooking One Sunday morning
before the winter was quite gone the sight of the frozen refuse melting
in heaps and particularly the loathsome edges of the rotting ice near
the gutters with the strata of wastepaper and straw litter and
eggshells and orange peel potatoskins and cigarstumps made him
unhappy He gave a whimsical shrug for the squalor of the neighboring
houses and said to himself rather than the boy who was with him Its
curious isnt it how fond the poor people are of these unpleasant
thoroughfares You always find them living in the worst streets

The burden of all the wrong in the world comes on the poor said the
boy Every sort of fraud and swindling hurts them the worst The city
wastes the money its paid to clean the streets with and the poor have
to suffer for they cant afford to pay twice like the rich

March stopped short Hallo Tom Is that your wisdom

Its what Mr Lindau says answered the boy doggedly as if not
pleased to have his ideas mocked at even if they were secondhand

And you didnt tell him that the poor lived in dirty streets because
they liked them and were too lazy and worthless to have them cleaned

No I didnt

Im surprised What do you think of Lindau generally speaking Tom

Well sir I dont like the way he talks about some things I dont
suppose this country is perfect but I think its about the best there
is and it dont do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time

Sound my son said March putting his hand on the boys shoulder and
beginning to walk on Well

Well then he says that it isnt the public frauds only that the poor
have to pay for but they have to pay for all the vices of the rich that
when a speculator fails or a bank cashier defaults or a firm suspends
or hard times come its the poor who have to give up necessaries where
the rich give up luxuries

Well well And then

Well then I think the crank comes in in Mr Lindau He says theres no
need of failures or frauds or hard times Its ridiculous There always
have been and there always will be But if you tell him that it seems to
make him perfectly furious

March repeated the substance of this talk to his wife Im glad to know
that Tom can see through such ravings He has lots of good common sense

It was the afternoon of the same Sunday and they were sauntering up
Fifth Avenue and admiring the wide old double houses at the lower end
at one corner they got a distinct pleasure out of the gnarled elbows that
a pollarded wistaria leaned upon the top of a garden wallfor its
convenience in looking into the street he said The line of these
comfortable dwellings once so fashionable was continually broken by the
facades of shops and March professed himself vulgarized by a want of
style in the people they met in their walk to Twentythird Street

Take me somewhere to meet my fellowexclusives Isabel he demanded I
pine for the society of my peers

He hailed a passing omnibus and made his wife get on the roof with him
Think of our doing such a thing in Boston she sighed with a little
shiver of satisfaction in her immunity from recognition and comment

You wouldnt be afraid to do it in London or Paris

No we should be strangers therejust as we are in New York I wonder
how long one could be a stranger here

Oh indefinitely in our way of living The place is really vast so
much larger than it used to seem and so heterogeneous

When they got down very far uptown and began to walk back by Madison
Avenue they found themselves in a different population from that they
dwelt among not heterogeneous at all very homogeneous and almost
purely American the only qualification was American Hebrew Such a
welldressed wellsatisfied wellfed looking crowd poured down the
broad sidewalks before the handsome stupid houses that March could
easily pretend he had got among his fellowplutocrats at last Still he
expressed his doubts whether this Sunday afternoon parade which seemed
to be a thing of custom represented the best form among the young people
of that region he wished he knew he blamed himself for becoming of a
fastidious conjecture he could not deny the fashion and the richness and
the indigeneity of the spectacle the promenaders looked NewYorky they
were the sort of people whom you would know for NewYorkers
elsewhereso well equipped and so perfectly kept at all points Their
silk hats shone and their boots their frocks had the right distension
behind and their bonnets perfect poise and distinction

The Marches talked of these and other facts of their appearance and
curiously questioned whether this were the best that a great material
civilization could come to it looked a little dull The mens faces were
shrewd and alert and yet they looked dull the womens were pretty and
knowing and yet dull It was probably the holiday expression of the
vast prosperous commercial class with unlimited money and no ideals
that money could not realize fashion and comfort were all that they
desired to compass and the culture that furnishes showily that
decorates and that tells the culture say of plays and operas rather
than books

Perhaps the observers did the promenaders injustice they might not have
been as commonminded as they looked But March said I understand
now why the poor people dont come up here and live in this clean
handsome respectable quarter of the town they would be bored to death
On the whole I think I should prefer Mott Street myself

In other walks the Marches tried to find some of the streets they had
wandered through the first day of their wedding journey in New York so
long ago They could not make sure of them but once they ran down to the
Battery and easily made sure of that though not in its old aspect They
recalled the hot morning when they sauntered over the trodden weed that
covered the sickly grassplots there and sentimentalized the sweltering
paupers who had crept out of the squalid tenements about for a breath of
air after a sleepless night Now the paupers were gone and where the old
mansions that had fallen to their use once stood there towered aloft and
abroad those heights and masses of manystoried brickwork for which
architecture has yet no proper form and aesthetics no name The trees and
shrubs all in their young spring green blew briskly over the guarded
turf in the south wind that came up over the water and in the wellpaved
alleys the ghosts of eighteenthcentury fashion might have met each other
in their old haunts and exchanged stately congratulations upon its
vastly bettered condition and perhaps puzzled a little over the colossal
lady on Bedloes Island with her lifted torch and still more over the
curving tracks and chaletstations of the Elevated road It is an outlook
of unrivalled beauty across the bay that smokes and flashes with the
innumerable stacks and sails of commerce to the hills beyond where the
moving forest of masts halts at the shore and roots itself in the groves
of the many villaged uplands The Marches paid the charming prospects a
willing duty and rejoiced in it as generously as if it had been their
own Perhaps it was they decided He said people owned more things in
common than they were apt to think and they drew the consolations of
proprietorship from the excellent management of Castle Garden which they
penetrated for a moments glimpse of the huge rotunda where the
immigrants first set foot on our continent It warmed their hearts so
easily moved to any cheap sympathy to see the friendly care the nation
took of these humble guests they found it even pathetic to hear the
proper authority calling out the names of such as had kin or acquaintance
waiting there to meet them No one appeared troubled or anxious the
officials had a conscientious civility the government seemed to manage
their welcome as well as a private company or corporation could have
done In fact it was after the simple strangers had left the government
care that March feared their woes might begin and he would have liked
the government to follow each of them to his home wherever he meant to
fix it within our borders He made note of the looks of the licensed
runners and touters waiting for the immigrants outside the government
premises he intended to work them up into a dramatic effect in some
sketch but they remained mere material in his memorandumbook together
with some quaint old houses on the Sixth Avenue road which he had
noticed on the way down On the way up these were superseded in his
regard by some hiproof structures on the Ninth Avenue which he thought
more Dutchlooking The perspectives of the crossstreets toward the
river were very lively with their turmoil of trucks and cars and carts
and hacks and foot passengers ending in the chimneys and masts of
shipping and final gleams of dancing water At a very noisy corner
clangorous with some sort of ironworking he made his wife enjoy with him
the quiet sarcasm of an inn that called itself the Homelike Hotel and
he speculated at fantastic length on the gentle associations of one who
should have passed his youth under its roof




III

First and last the Marches did a good deal of travel on the Elevated
roads which he said gave you such glimpses of material aspects in the
city as some violent invasion of others lives might afford in human
nature Once when the impulse of adventure was very strong in them they
went quite the length of the West Side lines and saw the city pushing
its way by irregular advances into the country Some spaces probably
held by the owners for that rise in value which the industry of others
providentially gives to the land of the wise and good it left vacant
comparatively far down the road and built up others at remoter points
It was a world of lofty apartment houses beyond the Park springing up in
isolated blocks with stretches of invaded rusticity between and here
and there an old countryseat standing dusty in its budding vines with
the ground before it in rocky upheaval for city foundations But wherever
it went or wherever it paused New York gave its peculiar stamp and the
adventurers were amused to find One Hundred and Twentyfifth Street
inchoately like Twentythird Street and Fourteenth Street in its shops
and shoppers The butchers shops and milliners shops on the avenue
might as well have been at Tenth as at One Hundredth Street

The adventurers were not often so adventurous They recognized that in
their willingness to let their fancy range for them and to let
speculation do the work of inquiry they were no longer young Their
point of view was singularly unchanged and their impressions of New York
remained the same that they had been fifteen years before huge noisy
ugly kindly it seemed to them now as it seemed then The main
difference was that they saw it more now as a life and then they only
regarded it as a spectacle and March could not release himself from a
sense of complicity with it no matter what whimsical or alien or
critical attitude he took A sense of the striving and the suffering
deeply possessed him and this grew the more intense as he gained some
knowledge of the forces at workforces of pity of destruction of
perdition of salvation He wandered about on Sunday not only through the
streets but into this tabernacle and that as the spirit moved him and
listened to those who dealt with Christianity as a system of economics as
well as a religion He could not get his wife to go with him she
listened to his report of what he heard and trembled it all seemed
fantastic and menacing She lamented the literary peace the intellectual
refinement of the life they had left behind them and he owned it was
very pretty but he said it was not lifeit was deathinlife She liked
to hear him talk in that strain of virtuous selfdenunciation but she
asked him Which of your prophets are you going to follow and he
answered Allall And a fresh one every Sunday And so they got their
laugh out of it at last but with some sadness at heart and with a dim
consciousness that they had got their laugh out of too many things in
life

What really occupied and compassed his activities in spite of his
strenuous reveries of work beyond it was his editorship On its social
side it had not fulfilled all the expectations which Fulkersons radiant
sketch of its duties and relations had caused him to form of it Most of
the contributions came from a distance even the articles written in New
York reached him through the post and so far from having his valuable
time as they called it consumed in interviews with his collaborators
he rarely saw any of them The boy on the stairs who was to fence him
from importunate visitors led a life of luxurious disoccupation and
whistled almost uninterruptedly When any one came March found himself
embarrassed and a little anxious The visitors were usually young men
terribly respectful but cherishing as he imagined ideals and opinions
chasmally different from his and he felt in their presence something
like an anachronism something like a fraud He tried to freshen up his
sympathies on them to get at what they were really thinking and feeling
and it was some time before he could understand that they were not really
thinking and feeling anything of their own concerning their art but were
necessarily in their quality of young inexperienced men mere
acceptants of older mens thoughts and feelings whether they were
tremendously conservative as some were or tremendously progressive as
others were Certain of them called themselves realists certain
romanticists but none of them seemed to know what realism was or what
romanticism they apparently supposed the difference a difference of
material March had imagined himself taking home to lunch or dinner the
aspirants for editorial favor whom he liked whether he liked their work
or not but this was not an easy matter Those who were at all
interesting seemed to have engagements and preoccupations after two or
three experiments with the bashfuller sortthose who had come up to the
metropolis with manuscripts in their hands in the good old literary
traditionhe wondered whether he was otherwise like them when he was
young like them He could not flatter himself that he was not and yet he
had a hope that the world had grown worse since his time which his wife
encouraged

Mrs March was not eager to pursue the hospitalities which she had at
first imagined essential to the literary prosperity of Every Other
Week her family sufficed her she would willingly have seen no one out
of it but the strangers at the weekly tabledhote dinner or the
audiences at the theatres Marchs devotion to his work made him
reluctant to delegate it to any one and as the summer advanced and the
question of where to go grew more vexed he showed a mans base
willingness to shirk it for himself by not going anywhere He asked his
wife why she did not go somewhere with the children and he joined her in
a search for nonmalarial regions on the map when she consented to
entertain this notion But when it came to the point she would not go he
offered to go with her then and then she would not let him She said she
knew he would be anxious about his work he protested that he could take
it with him to any distance within a few hours but she would not be
persuaded She would rather he stayed the effect would be better with
Mr Fulkerson they could make excursions and they could all get off a
week or two to the seashore near Bostonthe only real seashorein
August The excursions were practically confined to a single day at Coney
Island and once they got as far as Boston on the way to the seashore
near Boston that is Mrs March and the children went an editorial
exigency kept March at the last moment The Boston streets seemed very
queer and clean and empty to the children and the buildings little in
the horsecars the Boston faces seemed to arraign their mother with a
downdrawn severity that made her feel very guilty She knew that this
was merely the Puritan mask the cast of a dead civilization which
people of very amiable and tolerant minds were doomed to wear and she
sighed to think that less than a year of the heterogeneous gayety of New
York should have made her afraid of it The sky seemed cold and gray the
east wind which she had always thought so delicious in summer cut her
to the heart She took her children up to the South End and in the
pretty square where they used to live they stood before their alienated
home and looked up at its closeshuttered windows The tenants must have
been away but Mrs March had not the courage to ring and make sure
though she had always promised herself that she would go all over the
house when she came back and see how they had used it she could pretend
a desire for something she wished to take away She knew she could not
bear it now and the children did not seem eager She did not push on to
the seaside it would be forlorn there without their father she was glad
to go back to him in the immense friendly homelessness of New York and
hold him answerable for the change in her heart or her mind which made
its shapeless tumult a refuge and a consolation

She found that he had been giving the cook a holiday and dining about
hither and thither with Fulkerson Once he had dined with him at the
widows as they always called Mrs Leighton and then had spent the
evening there and smoked with Fulkerson and Colonel Woodburn on the
gallery overlooking the back yard They were all spending the summer in
New York The widow had got so good an offer for her house at St Barnaby
for the summer that she could not refuse it and the Woodburns found New
York a wateringplace of exemplary coolness after the burning Augusts and
Septembers of Charlottesburg

You can stand it well enough in our climate sir the colonel
explained till you come to the September heat that sometimes runs well
into October and then you begin to lose your temper sir Its never
quite so hot as it is in New York at times but its hot longer sir He
alleged as if something of the sort were necessary the example of a
famous Southwestern editor who spent all his summers in a New York hotel
as the most luxurious retreat on the continent consulting the weather
forecasts and running off on torrid days to the mountains or the sea
and then hurrying back at the promise of cooler weather The colonel had
not found it necessary to do this yet and he had been reluctant to leave
town where he was working up a branch of the inquiry which had so long
occupied him in the libraries and studying the great problem of labor
and poverty as it continually presented itself to him in the streets He
said that he talked with all sorts of people whom he found monstrously
civil if you took them in the right way and he went everywhere in the
city without fear and apparently without danger March could not find out
that he had ridden his hobby into the homes of want which he visited or
had proposed their enslavement to the inmates as a short and simple
solution of the great question of their lives he appeared to have
contented himself with the collection of facts for the persuasion of the
cultivated classes It seemed to March a confirmation of this impression
that the colonel should address his deductions from these facts so
unsparingly to him he listened with a respectful patience for which
Fulkerson afterward personally thanked him Fulkerson said it was not
often the colonel found such a good listener generally nobody listened
but Mrs Leighton who thought his ideas were shocking but honored him
for holding them so conscientiously Fulkerson was glad that March as
the literary department had treated the old gentleman so well because
there was an open feud between him and the art department Beaton was
outrageously rude Fulkerson must say though as for that the old
colonel seemed quite able to take care of himself and gave Beaton an
unqualified contempt in return for his unmannerliness The worst of it
was it distressed the old lady so she admired Beaton as much as she
respected the colonel and she admired Beaton Fulkerson thought rather
more than Miss Leighton did he asked March if he had noticed them
together March had noticed them but without any very definite
impression except that Beaton seemed to give the whole evening to the
girl Afterward he recollected that he had fancied her rather harassed by
his devotion and it was this point that he wished to present for his
wifes opinion

Girls often put on that air she said Its one of their ways of
teasing But then if the man was really very much in love and she was
only enough in love to be uncertain of herself she might very well seem
troubled It would be a very serious question Girls often dont know
what to do in such a case

Yes said March Ive often been glad that I was not a girl on that
account But I guess that on general principles Beaton is not more in
love than she is I couldnt imagine that young man being more in love
with anybody unless it was himself He might be more in love with
himself than any one else was

Well he doesnt interest me a great deal and I cant say Miss Leighton
does either I think she can take care of herself She has herself very
well in hand

Why so censorious pleaded March I dont defend her for having
herself in hand but is it a fault

Mrs March did not say She asked And how does Mr Fulkersons affair
get on

His affair You really think it is one Well Ive fancied so myself
and Ive had an idea of some time asking him Fulkerson strikes one as
truly domesticable conjugable at heart but Ive waited for him to
speak

I should think so

Yes Hes never opened on the subject yet Do you know I think
Fulkerson has his moments of delicacy

Moments Hes all delicacy in regard to women

Well perhaps so There is nothing in them to rouse his advertising
instincts




IV

The Dryfoos family stayed in town till August Then the father went West
again to look after his interests and Mrs Mandel took the two girls to
one of the great hotels in Saratoga Fulkerson said that he had never
seen anything like Saratoga for fashion and Mrs Mandel remembered that
in her own young ladyhood this was so for at least some weeks of the
year She had been too far withdrawn from fashion since her marriage to
know whether it was still so or not In this as in so many other
matters the Dryfoos family helplessly relied upon Fulkerson in spite of
Dryfooss angry determination that he should not run the family and in
spite of Christines doubt of his omniscience if he did not know
everything she was aware that he knew more than herself She thought
that they had a right to have him go with them to Saratoga or at least
go up and engage their rooms beforehand but Fulkerson did not offer to
do either and she did not quite see her way to commanding his services
The young ladies took what Mela called splendid dresses with them they
sat in the park of tall slim trees which the hotels quadrangle
enclosed and listened to the music in the morning or on the long piazza
in the afternoon and looked at the driving in the street or in the vast
parlors by night where all the other ladies were and they felt that
they were of the best there But they knew nobody and Mrs Mandel was so
particular that Mela was prevented from continuing the acquaintance even
of the few young men who danced with her at the Saturdaynight hops They
drove about but they went to places without knowing why except that the
carriage man took them and they had all the privileges of a proud
exclusivism without desiring them Once a motherly matron seemed to
perceive their isolation and made overtures to them but then desisted
as if repelled by Christines suspicion or by Melas too instant and
hilarious goodfellowship which expressed itself in hoarse laughter and
in a flow of talk full of topical and syntactical freedom From time to
time she offered to bet Christine that if Mr Fulkerson was only there
they would have a good time she wondered what they were all doing in New
York where she wished herself she rallied her sister about Beaton and
asked her why she did not write and tell him to come up there

Mela knew that Christine had expected Beaton to follow them Some banter
had passed between them to this effect he said he should take them in on
his way home to Syracuse Christine would not have hesitated to write to
him and remind him of his promise but she had learned to distrust her
literature with Beaton since he had laughed at the spelling in a scrap of
writing which dropped out of her musicbook one night She believed that
he would not have laughed if he had known it was hers but she felt that
she could hide better the deficiencies which were not committed to paper
she could manage with him in talking she was too ignorant of her
ignorance to recognize the mistakes she made then Through her own
passion she perceived that she had some kind of fascination for him she
was graceful and she thought it must be that she did not understand
that there was a kind of beauty in her small irregular features that
piqued and haunted his artistic sense and a look in her black eyes
beyond her intelligence and intention Once he sketched her as they sat
together and flattered the portrait without getting what he wanted in
it he said he must try her some time in color and he said things which
when she made Mela repeat them could only mean that he admired her more
than anybody else He came fitfully but he came often and she rested
content in a girls indefiniteness concerning the affair if her thought
went beyond lovemaking to marriage she believed that she could have him
if she wanted him Her fathers money counted in this she divined that
Beaton was poor but that made no difference she would have enough for
both the money would have counted as an irresistible attraction if there
had been no other

The affair had gone on in spite of the sidelong looks of restless dislike
with which Dryfoos regarded it but now when Beaton did not come to
Saratoga it necessarily dropped and Christines content with it She
bore the trial as long as she could she used pride and resentment
against it but at last she could not bear it and with Melas help she
wrote a letter bantering Beaton on his stay in New York and playfully
boasting of Saratoga It seemed to them both that it was a very bright
letter and would be sure to bring him they would have had no scruple
about sending it but for the doubt they had whether they had got some of
the words right Mela offered to bet Christine anything she dared that
they were right and she said Send it anyway it was no difference if
they were wrong But Christine could not endure to think of that laugh of
Beatons and there remained only Mrs Mandel as authority on the
spelling Christine dreaded her authority on other points but Mela said
she knew she would not interfere and she undertook to get round her
Mrs Mandel pronounced the spelling bad and the taste worse she forbade
them to send the letter and Mela failed to get round her though she
threatened if Mrs Mandel would not tell her how to spell the wrong
words that she would send the letter as it was then Mrs Mandel said
that if Mr Beaton appeared in Saratoga she would instantly take them
both home When Mela reported this result Christine accused her of
having mismanaged the whole business she quarrelled with her and they
called each other names Christine declared that she would not stay in
Saratoga and that if Mrs Mandel did not go back to New York with her
she should go alone They returned the first week in September but by
that time Beaton had gone to see his people in Syracuse

Conrad Dryfoos remained at home with his mother after his father went
West He had already taken such a vacation as he had been willing to
allow himself and had spent it on a charity farm near the city where
the fathers with whom he worked among the poor on the East Side in the
winter had sent some of their wards for the summer It was not possible
to keep his recreation a secret at the office and Fulkerson found a
pleasure in figuring the jolly time Brother Conrad must have teaching
farm work among those paupers and potential reprobates He invented
details of his experience among them and March could not always help
joining in the laugh at Conrads humorless helplessness under Fulkersons
burlesque denunciation of a summer outing spent in such dissipation

They had time for a great deal of joking at the office during the season
of leisure which penetrates in August to the very heart of business and
they all got on terms of greater intimacy if not greater friendliness
than before Fulkerson had not had so long to do with the advertising
side of human nature without developing a vein of cynicism of no great
depth perhaps but broad and underlying his whole point of view he
made light of Beatons solemnity as he made light of Conrads humanity
The art editor with abundant sarcasm had no more humor than the
publisher and was an easy prey in the managers hands but when he had
been led on by Fulkersons flatteries to make some betrayal of egotism
he brooded over it till he had thought how to revenge himself in
elaborate insult For Beatons talent Fulkerson never lost his
admiration but his joke was to encourage him to give himself airs of
being the sole source of the magazines prosperity No bait of this sort
was too obvious for Beaton to swallow he could be caught with it as
often as Fulkerson chose though he was ordinarily suspicious as to the
motives of people in saying things With March he got on no better than
at first He seemed to be lying in wait for some encroachment of the
literary department on the art department and he met it now and then
with anticipative reprisal After these rebuffs the editor delivered him
over to the manager who could turn Beatons contrarymindedness to
account by asking the reverse of what he really wanted done This was
what Fulkerson said the fact was that he did get on with Beaton and
March contented himself with musing upon the contradictions of a
character at once so vain and so offensive so fickle and so sullen so
conscious and so simple

After the first jarring contact with Dryfoos the editor ceased to feel
the disagreeable fact of the old mans mastery of the financial
situation None of the chances which might have made it painful occurred
the control of the whole affair remained in Fulkersons hands before he
went West again Dryfoos had ceased to come about the office as if
having once worn off the novelty of the sense of owning a literary
periodical he was no longer interested in it

Yet it was a relief somehow when he left town which he did not do
without coming to take a formal leave of the editor at his office He
seemed willing to leave March with a better impression than he had
hitherto troubled himself to make he even said some civil things about
the magazine as if its success pleased him and he spoke openly to March
of his hope that his son would finally become interested in it to the
exclusion of the hopes and purposes which divided them It seemed to
March that in the old mans warped and toughened heart he perceived a
disappointed love for his son greater than for his other children but
this might have been fancy Lindau came in with some copy while Dryfoos
was there and March introduced them When Lindau went out March
explained to Dryfoos that he had lost his hand in the war and he told
him something of Lindaus career as he had known it Dryfoos appeared
greatly pleased that Every Other Week was giving Lindau work He said
that he had helped to enlist a good many fellows for the war and had
paid money to fill up the Moffitt County quota under the later calls for
troops He had never been an Abolitionist but he had joined the
AntiNebraska party in 55 and he had voted for Fremont and for every
Republican President since then

At his own house March saw more of Lindau than of any other contributor
but the old man seemed to think that he must transact all his business
with March at his place of business The transaction had some
peculiarities which perhaps made this necessary Lindau always expected
to receive his money when he brought his copy as an acknowledgment of
the immediate right of the laborer to his hire and he would not take it
in a check because he did not approve of banks and regarded the whole
system of banking as the capitalistic manipulation of the peoples money
He would receive his pay only from Marchs hand because he wished to be
understood as working for him and honestly earning money honestly
earned and sometimes March inwardly winced a little at letting the old
man share the increase of capital won by such speculation as Dryfooss
but he shook off the feeling As the summer advanced and the artists and
classes that employed Lindau as a model left town one after another he
gave largely of his increasing leisure to the people in the office of
Every Other Week It was pleasant for March to see the respect with
which Conrad Dryfoos always used him for the sake of his hurt and his
gray beard There was something delicate and fine in it and there was
nothing unkindly on Fulkersons part in the hostilities which usually
passed between himself and Lindau Fulkerson bore himself reverently at
times too but it was not in him to keep that up especially when Lindau
appeared with more beer aboard than as Fulkerson said he could manage
shipshape On these occasions Fulkerson always tried to start him on the
theme of the unduly rich he made himself the champion of monopolies and
enjoyed the invectives which Lindau heaped upon him as a slave of
capital he said that it did him good

One day with the usual show of writhing under Lindaus scorn he said
Well I understand that although you despise me now Lindau

I tont desbise you the old man broke in his nostrils swelling and
his eyes flaming with excitement I bity you

Well it seems to come to the same thing in the end said Fulkerson
What I understand is that you pity me now as the slave of capital but
you would pity me a great deal more if I was the master of it

How you mean

If I was rich

That would tebendt said Lindau trying to control himself If you hat
inheritedt your money you might pe innocent but if you hat mate it
efery man that resbectedt himself would haf to ask how you mate it and
if you hat mate moch he would know

Hold on hold on now Lindau Aint that rather unAmerican doctrine
Were all brought up aint we to honor the man that made his money and
look downor try to look down sometimes its difficult on the fellow
that his father left it to

The old man rose and struck his breast On Amerigan he roared and as
he went on his accent grew more and more uncertain What iss Amerigan
Dere iss no Ameriga any more You start here free and brafe and you
glaim for efery man de right to life liperty and de bursuit of

Yes weve got a little arrangement of that sort with March here said
Fulkerson

Oh I am sawry said the old man contritely I meant noting bersonal
I tont tink we are all cuilty or gorrubt and efen among the rich there
are goodt men But gabidalhis passion rose againwhere you find
gabidal millions of money that a man hass cot togeder in fife ten
twenty years you findt the smell of tears and ploodt Dat iss what I
say And you cot to loog oudt for yourself when you meet a rich man
whether you meet an honest man

Well said Fulkerson I wish I was a subject of suspicion with you
Lindau Bytheway he added I understand that you think capital was
at the bottom of the veto of that pension of yours

What bension What fetoThe old man flamed up again No bension of
mine was efer fetoedt I renounce my bension begause I would sgorn to
dake money from a gofernment that I tont peliefe in any more Where you
hear that story

Well I dont know said Fulkerson rather embarrassed Its common
talk

Its a gommon lie then When the time gome dat dis iss a free gountry
again then I dake a bension again for my woundts but I would sdarfe
before I dake a bension now from a rebublic dat iss bought oap by
monobolies and ron by drusts and gompines and railroadts andt oil
gompanies

Look out Lindau said Fulkerson You bite yourself mit dat dog some
day But when the old man with a ferocious gesture of renunciation
whirled out of the place he added I guess I went a little too far that
time I touched him on a sore place I didnt mean to I heard some talk
about his pension being vetoed from Miss Leighton He addressed these
exculpations to Marchs grave face and to the pitying deprecation in the
eyes of Conrad Dryfoos whom Lindaus roaring wrath had summoned to the
door But Ill make it all right with him the next time he comes I
didnt know he was loaded or I wouldnt have monkeyed with him

Lindau does himself injustice when he gets to talking in that way said
March I hate to hear him Hes as good an American as any of us and
its only because he has too high an ideal of us

Oh go on Rub it inrub it in cried Fulkerson clutching his hair in
suffering which was not altogether burlesque How did I know he had
renounced his bension Why didnt you tell me

I didnt know it myself I only knew that he had none and I didnt ask
for I had a notion that it might be a painful subject

Fulkerson tried to turn it off lightly Well hes a noble old fellow
pity he drinks March would not smile and Fulkerson broke out Dog on
it Ill make it up to the old fool the next time he comes I dont like
that dynamite talk of his but any man thats given his hand to the
country has got mine in his grip for good Why March You dont suppose
I wanted to hurt his feelings do you

Why of course not Fulkerson

But they could not get away from a certain ruefulness for that time and
in the evening Fulkerson came round to Marchs to say that he had got
Lindaus address from Conrad and had looked him up at his lodgings

Well there isnt so much bricabrac there quite as Mrs Green left
you but Ive made it all right with Lindau as far as Im concerned I
told him I didnt know when I spoke that way and I honored him for
sticking to his brinciples I dont believe in his brincibles and we
wept on each others necksat least he did Dogged if he didnt kiss me
before I knew what he was up to He said I was his chenerous gong
friendt and he begged my barton if he had said anything to wound me I
tell you it was an affecting scene March and rats enough round in that
old barracks where he lives to fit out a firstclass case of delirium
tremens What does he stay there for Hes not obliged to

Lindaus reasons as March repeated them affected Fulkerson as
deliciously comical but after that he confined his pleasantries at the
office to Beaton and Conrad Dryfoos or as he said he spent the rest of
the summer in keeping Lindau smoothed up

It is doubtful if Lindau altogether liked this as well Perhaps he missed
the occasions Fulkerson used to give him of bursting out against the
millionaires and he could not well go on denouncing as the slafe of
gabidal a man who had behaved to him as Fulkerson had done though
Fulkersons servile relations to capital had been in nowise changed by
his nople gonduct

Their relations continued to wear this irksome character of mutual
forbearance and when Dryfoos returned in October and Fulkerson revived
the question of that dinner in celebration of the success of Every Other
Week he carried his complaisance to an extreme that alarmed March for
the consequences




V

You see Fulkerson explained I find that the old man has got an idea
of his own about that banquet and I guess theres some sense in it He
wants to have a preliminary little dinner where we can talk the thing up
firsthalf a dozen of us and he wants to give us the dinner at his
house Well thats no harm I dont believe the old man ever gave a
dinner and hed like to show off a little theres a good deal of human
nature in the old man after all He thought of you of course and
Colonel Woodburn and Beaton and me at the foot of the table and
Conrad and I suggested Kendricks hes such a nice little chap and the
old man himself brought up the idea of Lindau He said you told him
something about him and he asked why couldnt we have him too and I
jumped at it

Have Lindau to dinner asked March

Certainly why not Father Dryfoos has a notion of paying the old fellow
a compliment for what he done for the country There wont be any trouble
about it You can sit alongside of him and cut up his meat for him and
help him to things

Yes but it wont do Fulkerson I dont believe Lindau ever had on a
dresscoat in his life and I dont believe his brincibles would let
him wear one

Well neither had Dryfoos for the matter of that Hes as
highprincipled as old PanElectric himself when it comes to a
dresscoat said Fulkerson Were all going to go in business dress
the old man stipulated for that

It isnt the dresscoat alone March resumed Lindau and Dryfoos
wouldnt get on You know theyre opposite poles in everything You
mustnt do it Dryfoos will be sure to say something to outrage Lindaus
brincibles and therell be an explosion Its all well enough for
Dryfoos to feel grateful to Lindau and his wish to honor him does him
credit but to have Lindau to dinner isnt the way At the best the old
fellow would be very unhappy in such a house he would have a bad
conscience and I should be sorry to have him feel that hed been
recreant to his brincibles theyre about all hes got and whatever we
think of them were bound to respect his fidelity to them March warmed
toward Lindau in taking this view of him I should feel ashamed if I
didnt protest against his being put in a false position After all hes
my old friend and I shouldnt like to have him do himself injustice if
he is a crank

Of course said Fulkerson with some trouble in his face I appreciate
your feeling But there aint any danger he added buoyantly Anyhow
you spoke too late as the Irishman said to the chicken when he swallowed
him in a fresh egg Ive asked Lindau and hes accepted with blayzure
thats what he says

March made no other comment than a shrug

Youll see Fulkerson continued it ll go off all right Ill engage
to make it and I wont hold anybody else responsible

In the course of his married life March had learned not to censure the
irretrievable but this was just what his wife had not learned and she
poured out so much astonishment at what Fulkerson had done and so much
disapproval that March began to palliate the situation a little

After all it isnt a question of life and death and if it were I
dont see how its to be helped now

Oh its not to be helped now But I am surprised at Mr Fulkerson

Well Fulkerson has his moments of being merely human too

Mrs March would not deign a direct defence of her favorite Well Im
glad there are not to be ladies

I dont know Dryfoos thought of having ladies but it seems your
infallible Fulkerson overruled him Their presence might have kept Lindau
and our host in bounds

It had become part of the Marches conjugal joke for him to pretend that
she could allow nothing wrong in Fulkerson and he now laughed with a
mocking air of having expected it when she said Well then if Mr
Fulkerson says he will see that it all comes out right I suppose you
must trust his tact I wouldnt trust yours Basil The first wrong step
was taken when Mr Lindau was asked to help on the magazine

Well it was your infallible Fulkerson that took the step or at least
suggested it Im happy to say I had totally forgotten my early friend

Mrs March was daunted and silenced for a moment Then she said Oh
pshaw You know well enough he did it to please you

Im very glad he didnt do it to please you Isabel said her husband
with affected seriousness Though perhaps he did

He began to look at the humorous aspect of the affair which it certainly
had and to comment on the singular incongruities which Every Other
Week was destined to involve at every moment of its career I wonder if
Im mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was ever like it
Perhaps all periodicals are like it But I dont believe theres another
publication in New York that could bring together in honor of itself a
fraternity and equality crank like poor old Lindau and a belated
sociological crank like Woodburn and a truculent speculator like old
Dryfoos and a humanitarian dreamer like young Dryfoos and a
sentimentalist like me and a nondescript like Beaton and a pure
advertising essence like Fulkerson and a society spirit like Kendricks
If we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedly all the time
the dinner would be the greatest success in the world and we should come
home full of the highest mutual respect But I suspect we cant manage
thateven your infallible Fulkerson couldnt work itand Im afraid
that therell be some listening that ll spoil the pleasure of the time

March was so well pleased with this view of the case that he suggested
the idea involved to Fulkerson Fulkerson was too good a fellow not to
laugh at another mans joke but he laughed a little ruefully and he
seemed worn with more than one kind of care in the interval that passed
between the present time and the night of the dinner

Dryfoos necessarily depended upon him for advice concerning the scope and
nature of the dinner but he received the advice suspiciously and
contested points of obvious propriety with pertinacious stupidity
Fulkerson said that when it came to the point he would rather have had
the thing as he called it at Delmonicos or some other restaurant but
when he found that Dryfooss pride was bound up in having it at his own
house he gave way to him Dryfoos also wanted his womancook to prepare
the dinner but Fulkerson persuaded him that this would not do he must
have it from a caterer Then Dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at table
but Fulkerson convinced him that this would be incongruous at a mans
dinner It was decided that the dinner should be sent in from
Frescobaldis and Dryfoos went with Fulkerson to discuss it with the
caterer He insisted upon having everything explained to him and the
reason for having it and not something else in its place and he treated
Fulkerson and Frescobaldi as if they were in league to impose upon him
There were moments when Fulkerson saw the varnish of professional
politeness cracking on the Neapolitans volcanic surface and caught a
glimpse of the lava fires of the cooks nature beneath he trembled for
Dryfoos who was walking roughshod over him in the security of an
American who had known how to make his money and must know how to spend
it but he got him safely away at last and gave Frescobaldi a wink of
sympathy for his shrug of exhaustion as they turned to leave him

It was at first a relief and then an anxiety with Fulkerson that Lindau
did not come about after accepting the invitation to dinner until he
appeared at Dryfooss house prompt to the hour There was to be sure
nothing to bring him but Fulkerson was uneasily aware that Dryfoos
expected to meet him at the office and perhaps receive some verbal
acknowledgment of the honor done him Dryfoos he could see thought he
was doing all his invited guests a favor and while he stood in a certain
awe of them as people of much greater social experience than himself
regarded them with a kind of contempt as people who were going to have a
better dinner at his house than they could ever afford to have at their
own He had finally not spared expense upon it after pushing Frescobaldi
to the point of eruption with his misgivings and suspicions at the first
interview he had gone to him a second time alone and told him not to
let the money stand between him and anything he would like to do In the
absence of Frescobaldis fellowconspirator he restored himself in the
caterers esteem by adding whatever he suggested and Fulkerson after
trembling for the old mans niggardliness was now afraid of a fantastic
profusion in the feast Dryfoos had reduced the scale of the banquet as
regarded the number of guests but a confusing remembrance of what
Fulkerson had wished to do remained with him in part and up to the day
of the dinner he dropped in at Frescobaldis and ordered more dishes and
more of them He impressed the Italian as an American original of a novel
kind and when he asked Fulkerson how Dryfoos had made his money and
learned that it was primarily in natural gas he made note of some of his
eccentric tastes as peculiarities that were to be caressed in any future
naturalgas millionaire who might fall into his hands He did not
begrudge the time he had to give in explaining to Dryfoos the relation of
the different wines to the different dishes Dryfoos was apt to
substitute a costlier wine where he could for a cheaper one and he gave
Frescobaldi carte blanche for the decoration of the table with pieces of
artistic confectionery Among these the caterer designed one for a
surprise to his patron and a delicate recognition of the source of his
wealth which he found Dryfoos very willing to talk about when he
intimated that he knew what it was

Dryfoos left it to Fulkerson to invite the guests and he found ready
acceptance of his politeness from Kendricks who rightly regarded the
dinner as a part of the Every Other Week business and was too sweet
and kindhearted anyway not to seem very glad to come March was a
matter of course but in Colonel Woodburn Fulkerson encountered a
reluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious of
having for motives of his own rather strained a point in suggesting the
colonel to Dryfoos as a fit subject for invitation There had been only
one of the colonels articles printed as yet and though it had made a
sensation in its way and started the talk about that number still it
did not fairly constitute him a member of the staff or even entitle him
to recognition as a regular contributor Fulkerson felt so sure of
pleasing him with Dryfooss message that he delivered it in full family
council at the widows His daughter received it with all the enthusiasm
that Fulkerson had hoped for but the colonel said stiffly I have not
the pleasure of knowing Mr Dryfoos Miss Woodburn appeared ready to
fall upon him at this but controlled herself as if aware that filial
authority had its limits and pressed her lips together without saying
anything

Yes I know Fulkerson admitted But it isnt a usual case Mr
Dryfoos dont go in much for the conventionalities I reckon he dont
know much about em come to boil it down and he hopedhere Fulkerson
felt the necessity of inventing a littlethat you would excuse any want
of ceremony its to be such an informal affair anyway were all going
in business dress and there aint going to be any ladies Hed have come
himself to ask you but hes a kind of a bashful old fellow Its all
right Colonel Woodburn

I take it that it is sir said the colonel courteously but with
unabated state coming from you But in these matters we have no right
to burden our friends with our decisions

Of course of course said Fulkerson feeling that he had been
delicately told to mind his own business

I understand the colonel went on the relation that Mr Dryfoos bears
to the periodical in which you have done me the honor to print my papah
but this is a question of passing the bounds of a purely business
connection and of eating the salt of a man whom you do not definitely
know to be a gentleman

Mah goodness his daughter broke in If you bah your own salt with his
money

It is supposed that I earn his money before I buy my salt with it
returned her father severely And in these times when money is got in
heaps through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism it
behooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered him is
not the profusion of a thief with his booty I dont say that Mr
Dryfooss goodfortune is not honest I simply say that I know nothing
about it and that I should prefer to know something before I sat down at
his board

Youre all right colonel said Fulkerson and so is Mr Dryfoos I
give you my word that there are no flies on his personal integrity if
thats what you mean Hes hard and hed push an advantage but I dont
believe he would take an unfair one Hes speculated and made money every
time but I never heard of his wrecking a railroad or belonging to any
swindling company or any grinding monopoly He does chance it in stocks
but hes always played on the square if you call stocks gambling

May I think this over till morning asked the colonel

Oh certainly certainly said Fulkerson eagerly I dont know as
theres any hurry

Miss Woodburn found a chance to murmur to him before he went Hell
come And Ahm so much oblahged Mr Fulkerson Ah jost know its all
you doing and it will give papa a chance to toak to some new people
and get away from us evahlastin women for once

I dont see why any one should want to do that said Fulkerson with
grateful gallantry But Ill be dogged he said to March when he told
him about this odd experience if I ever expected to find Colonel
Woodburn on old Lindaus ground He did come round handsomely this
morning at breakfast and apologized for taking time to think the
invitation over before he accepted You understand he says that if
it had been to the table of some friend not so prosperous as Mr
Dryfoosyour friend Mr March for instanceit would have been
sufficient to know that he was your friend But in these days it is a
duty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to know
a rich man or not The chances of making money disreputably are so great
that the chances are against a man who has made money if hes made a
great deal of it

March listened with a face of ironical insinuation That was very good
and he seems to have had a good deal of confidence in your patience and
in your sense of his importance to the occasion

No no Fulkerson protested theres none of that kind of thing about
the colonel I told him to take time to think it over hes the
simplesthearted old fellow in the world

I should say so After all he didnt give any reason he had for
accepting But perhaps the young lady had the reason

Pshaw March said Fulkerson




VI

So far as the Dryfoos family was concerned the dinner might as well have
been given at Frescobaldis rooms None of the ladies appeared Mrs
Dryfoos was glad to escape to her own chamber where she sat before an
autumnal fire shaking her head and talking to herself at times with the
foreboding of evil which old women like her make part of their religion
The girls stood just out of sight at the head of the stairs and disputed
which guest it was at each arrival Mrs Mandel had gone to her room to
write letters after beseeching them not to stand there When Kendricks
came Christine gave Mela a little pinch equivalent to a little mocking
shriek for on the ground of his long talk with Mela at Mrs Horns in
the absence of any other admirer they based a superstition of his
interest in her when Beaton came Mela returned the pinch but
awkwardly so that it hurt and then Christine involuntarily struck her

Frescobaldis men were in possession everywhere they had turned the cook
out of her kitchen and the waitress out of her pantry the reluctant
Irishman at the door was supplemented by a vivid Italian who spoke
French with the guests and said Bien Monsieur and toute suite
and Merci to all as he took their hats and coats and effused a
hospitality that needed no language but the gleam of his eyes and teeth
and the play of his eloquent hands From his professional dresscoat
lustrous with the grease spotted on it at former dinners and parties
they passed to the frocks of the elder and younger Dryfoos in the
drawingroom which assumed informality for the affair but did not put
their wearers wholly at their ease The fathers coat was of black
broadcloth and he wore it unbuttoned the skirts were long and the
sleeves came down to his knuckles he shook hands with his guests and
the same dryness seemed to be in his palm and throat as he huskily asked
each to take a chair Conrads coat was of modern texture and cut and
was buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience within its
lapels he met March with his entreating smile and he seemed no more
capable of coping with the situation than his father They both waited
for Fulkerson who went about and did his best to keep life in the party
during the halfhour that passed before they sat down at dinner Beaton
stood gloomily aloof as if waiting to be approached on the right basis
before yielding an inch of his ground Colonel Woodburn awaiting the
moment when he could sally out on his hobby kept himself intrenched
within the dignity of a gentleman and examined askance the figure of old
Lindau as he stared about the room with his fine head up and his empty
sleeve dangling over his wrist March felt obliged to him for wearing a
new coat in the midst of that hostile luxury and he was glad to see
Dryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him as if he wished to
show him particular respect though it might have been because he was
less afraid of him than of the others He heard Lindau saying Boat the
name is Choarman and Dryfoos beginning to explain his Pennsylvania
Dutch origin and he suffered himself with a sigh of relief to fall
into talk with Kendricks who was always pleasant he was willing to talk
about something besides himself and had no opinions that he was not
ready to hold in abeyance for the time being out of kindness to others
In that group of impassioned individualities March felt him a refuge and
comfortwith his harmless dilettante intention of some day writing a
novel and his belief that he was meantime collecting material for it

Fulkerson while breaking the ice for the whole company was mainly
engaged in keeping Colonel Woodburn thawed out He took Kendricks away
from March and presented him to the colonel as a person who like
himself was looking into social conditions he put one hand on
Kendrickss shoulder and one on the colonels and made some flattering
joke apparently at the expense of the young fellow and then left them
March heard Kendricks protest in vain and the colonel say gravely I
do not wonder sir that these things interest you They constitute a
problem which society must solve or which will dissolve society and he
knew from that formula which the colonel had once used with him that
he was laying out a road for the exhibition of the hobbys paces later

Fulkerson came back to March who had turned toward Conrad Dryfoos and
said If we dont get this thing going pretty soon it ll be the death
of me and just then Frescobaldis butler came in and announced to
Dryfoos that dinner was served The old man looked toward Fulkerson with
a troubled glance as if he did not know what to do he made a gesture to
touch Lindaus elbow Fulkerson called out Heres Colonel Woodburn Mr
Dryfoos as if Dryfoos were looking for him and he set the example of
what he was to do by taking Lindaus arm himself Mr Lindau is going to
sit at my end of the table alongside of March Stand not upon the order
of your going gentlemen but fall in at once He contrived to get
Dryfoos and the colonel before him and he let March follow with
Kendricks Conrad came last with Beaton who had been turning over the
music at the piano and chafing inwardly at the whole affair At the
table Colonel Woodburn was placed on Dryfooss right and March on his
left March sat on Fulkersons right with Lindau next him and the young
men occupied the other seats

Put you next to March Mr Lindau said Fulkerson so you can begin to
put Apollinaris in his champagneglass at the right moment you know his
little weakness of old sorry to say its grown on him

March laughed with kindly acquiescence in Fulkersons wish to start the
gayety and Lindau patted him on the shoulder I know hiss veakness If
he liges a class of vine it iss begause his loaf ingludes efen hiss
enemy as Shakespeare galled it

Ah but Shakespeare couldnt have been thinking of champagne said
Kendricks

I suppose sir Colonel Woodburn interposed with lofty courtesy
champagne could hardly have been known in his day

I suppose not colonel returned the younger man deferentially He
seemed to think that sack and sugar might be a fault but he didnt
mention champagne

Perhaps he felt there was no question about that suggested Beaton who
then felt that he had not done himself justice in the sally

I wonder just when champagne did come in said March

I know when it ought to come in said Fulkerson Before the soup

They all laughed and gave themselves the air of drinking champagne out
of tumblers every day as men like to do Dryfoos listened uneasily he
did not quite understand the allusions though he knew what Shakespeare
was well enough Conrads face expressed a gentle deprecation of joking
on such a subject but he said nothing

The talk ran on briskly through the dinner The young men tossed the ball
back and forth they made some wild shots but they kept it going and
they laughed when they were hit The wine loosed Colonel Woodburns
tongue he became very companionable with the young fellows with the
feeling that a literary dinner ought to have a didactic scope he praised
Scott and Addison as the only authors fit to form the minds of gentlemen

Kendricks agreed with him but wished to add the name of Flaubert as a
master of style Style you know he added is the man

Very true sir you are quite right sir the colonel assented he
wondered who Flaubert was

Beaton praised Baudelaire and Maupassant he said these were the masters
He recited some lurid verses from Baudelaire Lindau pronounced them a
disgrace to human nature and gave a passage from Victor Hugo on Louis
Napoleon with his heavy German accent and then he quoted Schiller
Ach boat that is a peaudifool Not zo he demanded of March

Yes beautiful but of course you know I think theres nobody like
Heine

Lindau threw back his great old head and laughed showing a want of teeth
under his mustache He put his hand on Marchs back This poyhe was a
poy denwars so gracy to pekin reading Heine that he gommence with the
tictionary bevore he knows any Grammar and ve bick it out vort by vort
togeder

He was a pretty cay poy in those days heigh Lindau asked Fulkerson
burlesquing the old mans accent with an impudent wink that made Lindau
himself laugh But in the dark ages I mean there in Indianapolis Just
how long ago did you old codgers meet there anyway Fulkerson saw the
restiveness in Dryfooss eye at the purely literary course the talk had
taken he had intended it to lead up that way to business to Every
Other Week but he saw that it was leaving Dryfoos too far out and he
wished to get it on the personal ground where everybody is at home

Ledt me zee mused Lindau Wass it in fiftynine or zixty Passil Idt
wass a year or dwo pefore the war proke oudt anyway

Those were exciting times said Dryfoos making his first entry into
the general talk I went down to Indianapolis with the first company
from our place and I saw the redshirts pouring in everywhere They had
a song

 Oh never mind the weather but git over double trouble
 For were bound for the land of Canaan

The fellows locked arms and went singin it up and down four or five
abreast in the moonlight crowded everybody else off the sidewalk

I remember I remember said Lindau nodding his head slowly up and
down A coodt many off them nefer gome pack from that landt of Ganaan
Mr Dryfoos

Youre right Mr Lindau But I reckon it was worth itthe country
weve got now Here young man He caught the arm of the waiter who was
going round with the champagne bottle Fill up Mr Lindaus glass
there I want to drink the health of those old times with him Heres to
your empty sleeve Mr Lindau God bless it No offence to you Colonel
Woodburn said Dryfoos turning to him before he drank

Not at all sir not at all said the colonel I will drink with you
if you will permit me

Well all drinkstanding cried Fulkerson Help March to get up
somebody Fill high the bowl with Samian Apollinaris for Coonrod Now
then hurrah for Lindau

They cheered and hammered on the table with the butts of their
knifehandles Lindau remained seated The tears came into his eyes he
said I thank you chendlemen and hiccoughed

Id a went into the war myself said Dryfoos but I was raisin a
family of young children and I didnt see how I could leave my farm But
I helped to fill up the quota at every call and when the volunteering
stopped I went round with the subscription paper myself and we offered
as good bounties as any in the State My substitute was killed in one of
the last skirmishesin fact after Lees surrenderand Ive took care
of his family more or less ever since

Bytheway March said Fulkerson what sort of an idea would it be to
have a good war storymight be a serialin the magazine The war has
never fully panned out in fiction yet It was used a good deal just after
it was over and then it was dropped I think its time to take it up
again I believe it would be a card

It was running in Marchs mind that Dryfoos had an old rankling shame in
his heart for not having gone into the war and that he had often made
that explanation of his course without having ever been satisfied with
it He felt sorry for him the fact seemed pathetic it suggested a
dormant nobleness in the man

Beaton was saying to Fulkerson You might get a series of sketches by
substitutes the substitutes havent been much heard from in the war
literature How would The Autobiography of a Substitute do You might
follow him up to the moment he was killed in the other mans place and
inquire whether he had any right to the feelings of a hero when he was
only hired in the place of one Might call it The Career of a Deputy
Hero

I fancy said March that there was a great deal of mixed motive in
the men who went into the war as well as in those who kept out of it We
canonized all that died or suffered in it but some of them must have
been selfseeking and lowminded like men in other vocations He found
himself saying this in Dryfooss behalf the old man looked at him
gratefully at first he thought and then suspiciously

Lindau turned his head toward him and said You are righdt Passil you
are righdt I haf zeen on the fieldt of pattle the voarst eggsipitions of
human pasenesschelousy fanity ecodistic bridte I haf zeen men in the
face off death itself gofferned by motifes as low asas pusiness
motifes

Well said Fulkerson it would be a grand thing for Every Other Week
if we could get some of those ideas worked up into a series It would
make a lot of talk

Colonel Woodburn ignored him in saying I think Major Lindau

High brifate prefet gorporal the old man interrupted in rejection of
the title

Hendricks laughed and said with a glance of appreciation at Lindau
Brevet corporal is good

Colonel Woodburn frowned a little and passed over the joke I think Mr
Lindau is right Such exhibitions were common to both sides though if
you gentlemen will pardon me for saying so I think they were less
frequent on ours We were fighting more immediately for existence We
were fewer than you were and we knew it we felt more intensely that if
each were not for all then none was for any

The colonels words made their impression Dryfoos said with authority
That is so

Colonel Woodburn Fulkerson called out if youll work up those ideas
into a short papersay three thousand wordsIll engage to make March
take it

The colonel went on without replying But Mr Lindau is right in
characterizing some of the motives that led men to the cannons mouth as
no higher than business motives and his comparison is the most forcible
that he could have used I was very much struck by it

The hobby was out the colonel was in the saddle with so firm a seat that
no effort sufficed to dislodge him The dinner went on from course to
course with barbaric profusion and from time to time Fulkerson tried to
bring the talk back to Every Other Week But perhaps because that was
only the ostensible and not the real object of the dinner which was to
bring a number of men together under Dryfooss roof and make them the
witnesses of his splendor make them feel the power of his wealth
Fulkersons attempts failed The colonel showed how commercialism was the
poison at the heart of our national life how we began as a simple
agricultural people who had fled to these shores with the instinct
divinely implanted of building a state such as the sun never shone upon
before how we had conquered the wilderness and the savage how we had
flung off in our struggle with the mothercountry the trammels of
tradition and precedent and had settled down a free nation to the
practice of the arts of peace how the spirit of commercialism had stolen
insidiously upon us and the infernal impulse of competition had
embroiled us in a perpetual warfare of interests developing the worst
passions of our nature and teaching us to trick and betray and destroy
one another in the strife for money till now that impulse had exhausted
itself and we found competition gone and the whole economic problem in
the hands of monopoliesthe Standard Oil Company the Sugar Trust the
Rubber Trust and what not And now what was the next thing Affairs
could not remain as they were it was impossible and what was the next
thing

The company listened for the main part silently Dryfoos tried to grasp
the idea of commercialism as the colonel seemed to hold it he conceived
of it as something like the drygoods business on a vast scale and he
knew he had never been in that He did not like to hear competition
called infernal he had always supposed it was something sacred but he
approved of what Colonel Woodburn said of the Standard Oil Company it
was all true the Standard Oil has squeezed Dryfoos once and made him
sell it a lot of oilwells by putting down the price of oil so low in
that region that he lost money on every barrel he pumped

All the rest listened silently except Lindau at every point the colonel
made against the present condition of things he said more and more
fiercely You are righdt you are righdt His eyes glowed his hand
played with his knifehilt When the colonel demanded And what is the
next thing he threw himself forward and repeated Yes sir What is
the next thing

Natural gas by thunder shouted Fulkerson

One of the waiters had profited by Lindaus posture to lean over him and
put down in the middle of the table a structure in white sugar It
expressed Frescobaldis conception of a derrick and a touch of nature
had been added in the flame of brandy which burned luridly up from a
small pit in the centre of the base and represented the gas in
combustion as it issued from the ground Fulkerson burst into a roar of
laughter with the words that recognized Frescobaldis personal tribute to
Dryfoos Everybody rose and peered over at the thing while he explained
the work of sinking a gaswell as he had already explained it to
Frescobaldi In the midst of his lecture he caught sight of the caterer
himself where he stood in the pantry doorway smiling with an artists
anxiety for the effect of his masterpiece

Come in come in Frescobaldi We want to congratulate you Fulkerson
called to him Here gentlemen Heres Frescobaldis health

They all drank and Frescobaldi smiling brilliantly and rubbing his
hands as he bowed right and left permitted himself to say to Dryfoos
You are please no You like

Firstrate firstrate said the old man but when the Italian had
bowed himself out and his guests had sunk into their seats again he said
dryly to Fulkerson I reckon they didnt have to torpedo that well or
the derrick wouldnt look quite so nice and clean

Yes Fulkerson answered and that aint quite the stylethat little
wigglywaggly blue flamethat the gas acts when you touch off a good
vein of it This might do for weak gas and he went on to explain

They call it weak gas when they tap it two or three hundred feet down
and anybody can sink a well in his back yard and get enough gas to light
and heat his house I remember one fellow that had it blazing up from a
pipe through a flowerbed just like a jet of water from a fountain My
my my You felyou gentlemenought to go out and see that country all
of you Wish we could torpedo this well Mr Dryfoos and let em see how
it works Mind that one you torpedoed for me You know when they sink a
well he went on to the company they cant always most generally
sometimes tell whether theyre goin to get gas or oil or salt water
Why when they first began to bore for salt water out on the Kanawha
back about the beginning of the century they used to get gas now and
then and then they considered it a failure they called a gaswell a
blower and give it up in disgust the time wasnt ripe for gas yet Now
they bore away sometimes till they get halfway to China and dont seem
to strike anything worth speaking of Then they put a dynamite torpedo
down in the well and explode it They have a little bar of iron that they
call a Godevil and they just drop it down on the business end of the
torpedo and then stand from under if you please You hear a noise and
in about half a minute you begin to see one and it begins to rain oil
and mud and salt water and rocks and pitchforks and adoptive citizens
and when it clears up the derricks paintedgot a coat on that ll wear
in any climate Thats what our honored host meant Generally get some
visiting lady when theres one round to drop the Godevil But that day
we had to put up with Conrad here They offered to let me drop it but I
declined I told em I hadnt much practice with Godevils in the
newspaper syndicate business and I wasnt very well myself anyway
Astonishing Fulkerson continued with the air of relieving his
explanation by an anecdote how reckless they get using dynamite when
theyre torpedoing wells We stopped at one place where a fellow was
handling the cartridges pretty freely and Mr Dryfoos happened to
caution him a little and that ass came up with one of em in his hand
and began to pound it on the buggywheel to show us how safe it was I
turned green I was so scared but Mr Dryfoos kept his color and kind
of coaxed the fellow till he quit You could see he was the fool kind
that if you tried to stop him hed keep on hammering that cartridge just
to show that it wouldnt explode till he blew you into Kingdom Come
When we got him to go away Mr Dryfoos drove up to his foreman Pay
Sheney off and discharge him on the spot says he Hes too safe a man
to have round he knows too much about dynamite I never saw anybody so
cool

Dryfoos modestly dropped his head under Fulkersons flattery and without
lifting it turned his eyes toward Colonel Woodburn I had all sorts of
men to deal with in developing my property out there but I had very
little trouble with them generally speaking

Ah ah you foundt the laboringman reasonabledractabletocile
Lindau put in

Yes generally speaking Dryfoos answered They mostly knew which side
of their bread was buttered I did have one little difficulty at one
time It happened to be when Mr Fulkerson was out there Some of the men
tried to form a union

No no cried Fulkerson Let me tell that I know you wouldnt do
yourself justice Mr Dryfoos and I want em to know how a strike can be
managed if you take it in time You see some of those fellows got a
notion that there ought to be a union among the workingmen to keep up
wages and dictate to the employers and Mr Dryfooss foreman was the
ringleader in the business They understood pretty well that as soon as
he found it out that foreman would walk the plank and so they watched
out till they thought they had Mr Dryfoos just where they wanted
himeverything on the keen jump and every man worth his weight in
diamondsand then they came to him andtold him to sign a promise to
keep that foreman to the end of the season or till he was through with
the work on the Dryfoos and Hendry Addition under penalty of having them
all knock off Mr Dryfoos smelled a mouse but he couldnt tell where
the mouse was he saw that they did have him and he signed of course
There wasnt anything really against the fellow anyway he was a
firstrate man and he did his duty every time only hed got some of
those ideas into his head and they turned it Mr Dryfoos signed and
then he laid low

March saw Lindau listening with a mounting intensity and heard him
murmur in German Shameful shameful

Fulkerson went on Well it wasnt long before they began to show their
hand but Mr Dryfoos kept dark He agreed to everything there never was
such an obliging capitalist before there wasnt a thing they asked of
him that he didnt do with the greatest of pleasure and all went merry
as a marriagebell till one morning a whole gang of fresh men marched
into the Dryfoos and Hendry Addition under the escort of a dozen
Pinkertons with repeating rifles at halfcock and about fifty fellows
found themselves out of a job You never saw such a mad set

Pretty neat said Kendricks who looked at the affair purely from an
aesthetic point of view Such a coup as that would tell tremendously in
a play

That was vile treason said Lindau in German to March Hes an
infamous traitor I cannot stay here I must go

He struggled to rise while March held him by the coat and implored him
under his voice For Heavens sake dont Lindau You owe it to
yourself not to make a scene if you come here Something in it all
affected him comically he could not help laughing

The others were discussing the matter and seemed not to have noticed
Lindau who controlled himself and sighed You are right I must have
patience

Beaton was saying to Dryfoos Pity your Pinkertons couldnt have given
them a few shots before they left

No that wasnt necessary said Dryfoos I succeeded in breaking up
the union I entered into an agreement with other parties not to employ
any man who would not swear that he was nonunion If they had attempted
violence of course they could have been shot But there was no fear of
that Those fellows can always be depended upon to cut one anothers
throats in the long run

But sometimes said Colonel Woodburn who had been watching throughout
for a chance to mount his hobby again they make a good deal of trouble
first How was it in the great railroad strike of 77

Well I guess there was a little trouble that time colonel said
Fulkerson But the men that undertake to override the laws and paralyze
the industries of a country like this generally get left in the end

Yes sir generally and up to a certain point always But its the
exceptional that is apt to happen as well as the unexpected And a
little reflection will convince any gentleman here that there is always a
danger of the exceptional in your system The fact is those fellows have
the game in their own hands already A strike of the whole body of the
Brotherhood of Engineers alone would starve out the entire Atlantic
seaboard in a week labor insurrection could make head at a dozen given
points and your government couldnt move a man over the roads without
the help of the engineers

That is so said Kendrick struck by the dramatic character of the
conjecture He imagined a fiction dealing with the situation as something
already accomplished

Why dont some fellow do the Battle of Dorking act with that thing
said Fulkerson It would be a card

Exactly what I was thinking Mr Fulkerson said Kendricks

Fulkerson laughed Telepathyclear case of mind transference Better
see March here about it Id like to have it in Every Other Week It
would make talk

Perhaps it might set your people to thinking as well as talking said
the colonel

Well sir said Dryfoos setting his lips so tightly together that his
imperial stuck straight outward if I had my way there wouldnt be any
Brotherhood of Engineers nor any other kind of labor union in the whole
country

What shouted Lindau You would sobbress the unionss of the
voarkingmen

Yes I would

And what would you do with the unionss of the gabidaliststhe
drostsand gompines and boolss Would you dake the righdt from one and
gif it to the odder

Yes sir I would said Dryfoos with a wicked look at him

Lindau was about to roar back at him with some furious protest but March
put his hand on his shoulder imploringly and Lindau turned to him to say
in German But it is infamousinfamous What kind of man is this Who
is he He has the heart of a tyrant

Colonel Woodburn cut in You couldnt do that Mr Dryfoos under your
system And if you attempted it with your conspiracy laws and that kind
of thing it might bring the climax sooner than you expected Your
commercialized society has built its house on the sands It will have to
go But I should be sorry if it went before its time

You are righdt sir said Lindau It would be a bity I hobe it will
last till it feelss its rottenness like Herodt Boat when its hour
gomes when it trope to bieces with the veight off its own
gorrubtionwhat then

Its not to be supposed that a system of things like this can drop to
pieces of its own accord like the old Republic of Venice said the
colonel But when the last vestige of commercial society is gone then
we can begin to build anew and we shall build upon the central idea
not of the false liberty you now worship but of responsibility
responsibility The enlightened the moneyed the cultivated class shall
be responsible to the central authorityemperor duke president the
name does not matterfor the national expense and the national defence
and it shall be responsible to the workingclasses of all kinds for homes
and lands and implements and the opportunity to labor at all times

The workingclasses shall be responsible to the leisure class for the
support of its dignity in peace and shall be subject to its command in
war The rich shall warrant the poor against planless production and the
ruin that now follows against danger from without and famine from
within and the poor

No no no shouted Lindau The State shall do thatthe whole beople
The men who voark shall have and shall eat and the men that will not
voark they shall sdarfe But no man need sdarfe He will go to the
State and the State will see that he haf voark and that he haf foodt
All the roadts and mills and mines and landts shall be the beoples and
be ron by the beople for the beople There shall be no rich and no boor
and there shall not be war any more for what bower wouldt dare to addack
a beople bound togeder in a broderhood like that

Lion and lamb act said Fulkerson not well knowing after so much
champagne what words he was using

No one noticed him and Colonel Woodburn said coldly to Lindau You are
talking paternalism sir

And you are dalking feutalism retorted the old man

The colonel did not reply A silence ensued which no one broke till
Fulkerson said Well now look here If either one of these millenniums
was brought about by force of arms or otherwise what would become of
Every Other Week Who would want March for an editor How would Beaton
sell his pictures Who would print Mr Kendrickss little society verses
and short stories What would become of Conrad and his good works Those
named grinned in support of Fulkersons diversion but Lindau and the
colonel did not speak Dryfoos looked down at his plate frowning

A waiter came round with cigars and Fulkerson took one Ah he said
as he bit off the end and leaned over to the emblematic masterpiece
where the brandy was still feebly flickering I wonder if theres enough
natural gas left to light my cigar His effort put the flame out and
knocked the derrick over it broke in fragments on the table Fulkerson
cackled over the ruin I wonder if all Moffitt will look that way after
labor and capital have fought it out together I hope this aint ominous
of anything personal Dryfoos

Ill take the risk of it said the old man harshly

He rose mechanically and Fulkerson said to Frescobaldis man You can
bring us the coffee in the library

The talk did not recover itself there Landau would not sit down he
refused coffee and dismissed himself with a haughty bow to the company
Colonel Woodburn shook hands elaborately all round when he had smoked
his cigar the others followed him It seemed to March that his own
goodnight from Dryfoos was dry and cold




VII

March met Fulkerson on the steps of the office next morning when he
arrived rather later than his wont Fulkerson did not show any of the
signs of suffering from the last nights pleasure which painted
themselves in Marchs face He flirted his hand gayly in the air and
said Hows your poor head and broke into a knowing laugh You dont
seem to have got up with the lark this morning The old gentleman is in
there with Conrad as bright as a biscuit hes beat you down Well we
did have a good time didnt we And old Lindau and the colonel didnt
they have a good time I dont suppose they ever had a chance before to
give their theories quite so much air Oh my how they did ride over us
Im just going down to see Beaton about the cover of the Christmas
number I think we ought to try it in three or four colors if we are
going to observe the day at all He was off before March could pull
himself together to ask what Dryfoos wanted at the office at that hour of
the morning he always came in the afternoon on his way uptown

The fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with which March
had parted from him the night before but Fulkersons cheerfulness seemed
to gainsay them afterward March did not know whether to attribute this
mood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times in Fulkerson or
to a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving him alone to the old
man who mounted to his room shortly after March had reached it

A sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face his jaw was set so firmly
that he did not seem able at once to open it He asked without the
ceremonies of greeting What does that onearmed Dutchman do on this
book

What does he do March echoed as people are apt to do with a question
that is mandatory and offensive

Yes sir what does he do Does he write for it

I suppose you mean Lindau said March He saw no reason for refusing to
answer Dryfooss demand and he decided to ignore its terms No he
doesnt write for it in the usual way He translates for it he examines
the foreign magazines and draws my attention to anything he thinks of
interest But I told you about this before

I know what you told me well enough And I know what he is He is a
redmouthed labor agitator Hes one of those foreigners that come here
from places where theyve never had a decent meals victuals in their
lives and as soon as they get their stomachs full they begin to make
trouble between our people and their hands Theres where the strikes
come from and the unions and the secret societies They come here and
break our Sabbath and teach their atheism They ought to be hung Let
em go back if they dont like it over here They want to ruin the
country

March could not help smiling a little at the words which came fast
enough now in the hoarse staccato of Dryfooss passion I dont know
whom you mean by they generally speaking but I had the impression that
poor old Lindau had once done his best to save the country I dont
always like his way of talking but I know that he is one of the truest
and kindest souls in the world and he is no more an atheist than I am
He is my friend and I cant allow him to be misunderstood

I dont care what he is Dryfoos broke out I wont have him round He
cant have any more work from this office I want you to stop it I want
you to turn him off

March was standing at his desk as he had risen to receive Dryfoos when
he entered He now sat down and began to open his letters

Do you hear the old man roared at him I want you to turn him off

Excuse me Mr Dryfoos said March succeeding in an effort to speak
calmly I dont know you in such a matter as this My arrangements as
editor of Every Other Week were made with Mr Fulkerson I have always
listened to any suggestion he has had to make

I dont care for Mr Fulkerson He has nothing to do with it retorted
Dryfoos but he seemed a little daunted by Marchs position

He has everything to do with it as far as I am concerned March
answered with a steadiness that he did not feel I know that you are
the owner of the periodical but I cant receive any suggestion from you
for the reason that I have given Nobody but Mr Fulkerson has any right
to talk with me about its management

Dryfoos glared at him for a moment and demanded threateningly Then
you say you wont turn that old loafer off You say that I have got to
keep on paying my money out to buy beer for a man that would cut my
throat if he got the chance

I say nothing at all Mr Dryfoos March answered The blood came into
his face and he added But I will say that if you speak again of Mr
Lindau in those terms one of us must leave this room I will not hear
you

Dryfoos looked at him with astonishment then he struck his hat down on
his head and stamped out of the room and down the stairs and a vague
pity came into Marchs heart that was not altogether for himself He
might be the greater sufferer in the end but he was sorry to have got
the better of that old man for the moment and he felt ashamed of the
anger into which Dryfooss anger had surprised him He knew he could not
say too much in defence of Lindaus generosity and unselfishness and he
had not attempted to defend him as a political economist He could not
have taken any ground in relation to Dryfoos but that which he held and
he felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive instructions
or commands from him Yet somehow he was not satisfied with the whole
affair and not merely because his present triumph threatened his final
advantage but because he felt that in his heart he had hardly done
justice to Dryfooss rights in the matter it did not quite console him
to reflect that Dryfoos had himself made it impossible He was tempted to
go home and tell his wife what had happened and begin his preparations
for the future at once But he resisted this weakness and kept
mechanically about his work opening the letters and the manuscripts
before him with that curious double action of the mind common in men of
vivid imaginations It was a relief when Conrad Dryfoos having
apparently waited to make sure that his father would not return came up
from the countingroom and looked in on March with a troubled face

Mr March he began I hope father hasnt been saying anything to you
that you cant overlook I know he was very much excited and when he is
excited he is apt to say things that he is sorry for

The apologetic attitude taken for Dryfoos so different from any attitude
the peremptory old man would have conceivably taken for himself made
March smile Oh no I fancy the boot is on the other leg I suspect Ive
said some things your father cant overlook Conrad He called the young
man by his Christian name partly to distinguish him from his father
partly from the infection of Fulkersons habit and partly from a
kindness for him that seemed naturally to express itself in that way

I know he didnt sleep last night after you all went away Conrad
pursued and of course that made him more irritable and he was tried a
good deal by some of the things that Mr Lindau said

I was tried a good deal myself said March Lindau ought never to have
been there

No Conrad seemed only partially to assent

I told Mr Fulkerson so I warned him that Lindau would be apt to break
out in some way It wasnt just to him and it wasnt just to your
father to ask him

Mr Fulkerson had a good motive Conrad gently urged He did it
because he hurt his feelings that day about the pension

Yes but it was a mistake He knew that Lindau was inflexible about his
principles as he calls them and that one of his first principles is to
denounce the rich in season and out of season I dont remember just what
he said last night and I really thought Id kept him from breaking out
in the most offensive way But your father seems very much incensed

Yes I know said Conrad

Of course I dont agree with Lindau I think there are as many good
kind just people among the rich as there are among the poor and that
they are as generous and helpful But Lindau has got hold of one of those
partial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth and

Partial truth the young man interrupted Didnt the Saviour himself
say How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
God

Why bless my soul cried March Do you agree with Lindau

I agree with the Lord Jesus Christ said the young man solemnly and a
strange light of fanaticism of exaltation came into his wide blue eyes
And I believe He meant the kingdom of heaven upon this earth as well as
in the skies

March threw himself back in his chair and looked at him with a kind of
stupefaction in which his eye wandered to the doorway where he saw
Fulkerson standing it seemed to him a long time before he heard him
saying Hello hello Whats the row Conrad pitching into you on old
Lindaus account too

The young man turned and after a glance at Fulkersons light smiling
face went out as if in his present mood he could not bear the contact
of that persiflant spirit

March felt himself getting provisionally very angry again Excuse me
Fulkerson but did you know when you went out what Mr Dryfoos wanted to
see me for

Well no I didnt exactly said Fulkerson taking his usual seat on a
chair and looking over the back of it at March I saw he was on his car
about something and I thought Id better not monkey with him much I
supposed he was going to bring you to book about old Lindau somehow
Fulkerson broke into a laugh

March remained serious Mr Dryfoos he said willing to let the simple
statement have its own weight with Fulkerson and nothing more came in
here and ordered me to discharge Lindau from his employment on the
magazineto turn him off as he put it

Did he asked Fulkerson with unbroken cheerfulness The old man is
business every time Well I suppose you can easily get somebody else to
do Lindaus work for you This town is just running over with
halfstarved linguists What did you say

What did I say March echoed Look here Fulkerson you may regard
this as a joke but I dont Im not used to being spoken to as if I were
the foreman of a shop and told to discharge a sensitive and cultivated
man like Lindau as if he were a drunken mechanic and if thats your
idea of me

Oh hello now March You mustnt mind the old mans way He dont mean
anything by ithe dont know any better if you come to that

Then I know better said March I refused to receive any instructions
from Mr Dryfoos whom I dont know in my relations with Every Other
Week and I referred him to you

You did Fulkerson whistled He owns the thing

I dont care who owns the thing said March My negotiations were with
you alone from the beginning and I leave this matter with you What do
you wish done about Lindau

Oh better let the old fool drop said Fulkerson Hell light on his
feet somehow and it will save a lot of rumpus

And if I decline to let him drop

Oh come now March dont do that Fulkerson began

If I decline to let him drop March repeated what will you do

Ill be dogged if I know what Ill do said Fulkerson I hope you
wont take that stand If the old man went so far as to speak to you
about it his mind is made up and we might as well knock under first as
last

And do you mean to say that you would not stand by me in what I
considered my dutyin a matter of principle

Why of course March said Fulkerson coaxingly I mean to do the
right thing But Dryfoos owns the magazine

He doesnt own me said March rising He has made the little mistake
of speaking to me as if he did and whenMarch put on his hat and took
his overcoat down from its nailwhen you bring me his apologies or
come to say that having failed to make him understand they were
necessary you are prepared to stand by me I will come back to this
desk Otherwise my resignation is at your service

He started toward the door and Fulkerson intercepted him Ah now look
here March Dont do that Hang it all dont you see where it leaves
me Now you just sit down a minute and talk it over I can make you
seeI can show youWhy confound the old Dutch beerbuzzer Twenty of
him wouldnt be worth the trouble hes makin Let him go and the old
man ll come round in time

I dont think weve understood each other exactly Mr Fulkerson said
March very haughtily Perhaps we never can but Ill leave you to think
it out

He pushed on and Fulkerson stood aside to let him pass with a dazed
look and a mechanical movement There was something comic in his rueful
bewilderment to March who was tempted to smile but he said to himself
that he had as much reason to be unhappy as Fulkerson and he did not
smile His indignation kept him hot in his purpose to suffer any
consequence rather than submit to the dictation of a man like Dryfoos he
felt keenly the degradation of his connection with him and all his
resentment of Fulkersons original uncandor returned at the same time
his heart ached with foreboding It was not merely the work in which he
had constantly grown happier that he saw taken from him but he felt the
misery of the man who stakes the security and plenty and peace of home
upon some cast and knows that losing will sweep from him most that most
men find sweet and pleasant in life He faced the fact which no good man
can front without terror that he was risking the support of his family
and for a point of pride of honor which perhaps he had no right to
consider in view of the possible adversity He realized as every
hireling must no matter how skillfully or gracefully the tie is
contrived for his wearing that he belongs to another whose will is his
law His indignation was shot with abject impulses to go back and tell
Fulkerson that it was all right and that he gave up To end the anguish
of his struggle he quickened his steps so that he found he was reaching
home almost at a run




VIII

He must have made more clatter than he supposed with his key at the
apartment door for his wife had come to let him in when he flung it
open Why Basil she said whats brought you back Are you sick
Youre all pale Well no wonder This is the last of Mr Fulkersons
dinners you shall go to Youre not strong enough for it and your
stomach will be all out of order for a week How hot you are and in a
drip of perspiration Now youll be sick She took his hat away which
hung dangling in his hand and pushed him into a chair with tender
impatience What is the matter Has anything happened

Everything has happened he said getting his voice after one or two
husky endeavors for it and then he poured out a confused and huddled
statement of the case from which she only got at the situation by
prolonged crossquestioning

At the end she said I knew Lindau would get you into trouble

This cut March to the heart Isabel he cried reproachfully

Oh I know she retorted and the tears began to come I dont wonder
you didnt want to say much to me about that dinner at breakfast I
noticed it but I thought you were just dull and so I didnt insist I
wish I had now If you had told me what Lindau had said I should have
known what would have come of it and I could have advised you

Would you have advised me March demanded curiously to submit to
bullying like that and meekly consent to commit an act of cruelty
against a man who had once been such a friend to me

It was an unlucky day when you met him I suppose we shall have to go
And just when we had got used to New York and begun to like it I dont
know where we shall go now Boston isnt like home any more and we
couldnt live on two thousand there I should be ashamed to try Im sure
I dont know where we can live on it I suppose in some country village
where there are no schools or anything for the children I dont know
what theyll say when we tell them poor things

Every word was a stab in Marchs heart so weakly tender to his own his
wifes tears after so much experience of the comparative lightness of
the griefs that weep themselves out in women always seemed wrung from
his own soul if his children suffered in the least through him he felt
like a murderer It was far worse than he could have imagined the way
his wife took the affair though he had imagined certain words or
perhaps only looks from her that were bad enough He had allowed for
trouble but trouble on his account a svmpathy that might burden and
embarrass him but he had not dreamed of this merely domestic this
petty this sordid view of their potential calamity which left him
wholly out of the question and embraced only what was most crushing and
desolating in the prospect He could not bear it He caught up his hat
again and with some hope that his wife would try to keep him rushed
out of the house He wandered aimlessly about thinking the same
exhausting thoughts over and over till he found himself horribly hungry
then he went into a restaurant for his lunch and when he paid he tried
to imagine how he should feel if that were really his last dollar

He went home toward the middle of the afternoon basely hoping that
Fulkerson had sent him some conciliatory message or perhaps was waiting
there for him to talk it over March was quite willing to talk it over
now But it was his wife who again met him at the door though it seemed
another woman than the one he had left weeping in the morning

I told the children she said in smiling explanation of his absence
from lunch that perhaps you were detained by business I didnt know
but you had gone back to the office

Did you think I would go back there Isabel asked March with a
haggard look Well if you say so I will go back and do what Dryfoos
ordered me to do Im sufficiently cowed between him and you I can
assure you

Nonsense she said I approve of everything you did But sit down
now and dont keep walking that way and let me see if I understand it
perfectly Of course I had to have my say out

She made him go all over his talk with Dryfoos again and report his own
language precisely From time to time as she got his points she said
That was splendid Good enough for him and Oh Im so glad you said
that to him At the end she said

Well now lets look at it from his point of view Lets be perfectly
just to him before we take another step forward

Or backward March suggested ruefully The case is simply this he
owns the magazine

Of course

And he has a right to expect that I will consider his pecuniary
interests

Oh those detestable pecuniary interests Dont you wish there wasnt
any money in the world

Yes or else that there was a great deal more of it And I was perfectly
willing to do that I have always kept that in mind as one of my duties
to him ever since I understood what his relation to the magazine was

Yes I can bear witness to that in any court of justice Youve done it
a great deal more than I could Basil And it was just the same way with
those horrible insurance people

I know March went on trying to be proof against her flatteries or at
least to look as if he did not deserve praise I know that what Lindau
said was offensive to him and I can understand how he felt that he had a
right to punish it All I say is that he had no right to punish it
through me

Yes said Mrs March askingly

If it had been a question of making Every Other Week the vehicle of
Lindaus peculiar opinionsthough theyre not so very peculiar he might
have got the most of them out of RuskinI shouldnt have had any ground
to stand on or at least then I should have had to ask myself whether his
opinions would be injurious to the magazine or not

I dont see Mrs March interpolated how they could hurt it much
worse than Colonel Woodburns article crying up slavery

Well said March impartially we could print a dozen articles
praising the slavery its impossible to have back and it wouldnt hurt
us But if we printed one paper against the slavery which Lindau claims
still exists some people would call us bad names and the countingroom
would begin to feel it But that isnt the point Lindaus connection
with Every Other Week is almost purely mechanical hes merely a
translator of such stories and sketches as he first submits to me and it
isnt at all a question of his opinions hurting us but of my becoming an
agent to punish him for his opinions That is what I wouldnt do thats
what I never will do

If you did said his wife I should perfectly despise you I didnt
understand how it was before I thought you were just holding out against
Dryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone with you and because you
wouldnt recognize his authority But now Im with you Basil every
time as that horrid little Fulkerson says But who would ever have
supposed he would be so base as to side against you

I dont know said March thoughtfully that we had a right to expect
anything else Fulkersons standards are low theyre merely business
standards and the good thats in him is incidental and something quite
apart from his morals and methods Hes naturally a generous and
rightminded creature but life has taught him to truckle and trick like
the rest of us

It hasnt taught you that Basil

Dont be so sure Perhaps its only that Im a poor scholar But I dont
know really that I despise Fulkerson so much for his course this
morning as for his gross and fulsome flatteries of Dryfoos last night I
could hardly stomach it

His wife made him tell her what they were and then she said Yes that
was loathsome I couldnt have believed it of Mr Fulkerson

Perhaps he only did it to keep the talk going and to give the old man a
chance to say something March leniently suggested It was a worse
effect because he didnt or couldnt follow up Fulkersons lead

It was loathsome all the same his wife insisted Its the end of Mr
Fulkerson as far as Im concerned

I didnt tell you before March resumed after a moment of my little
interview with Conrad Dryfoos after his father left and now he went on
to repeat what had passed between him and the young man

I suspect that he and his father had been having some words before the
old man came up to talk with me and that it was that made him so
furious

Yes but what a strange position for the son of such a man to take Do
you suppose he says such things to his father

I dont know but I suspect that in his meek way Conrad would say what
he believed to anybody I suppose we must regard him as a kind of crank

Poor young fellow He always makes me feel sad somehow He has such a
pathetic face I dont believe I ever saw him look quite happy except
that night at Mrs Horns when he was talking with Miss Vance and then
he made me feel sadder than ever

I dont envy him the life he leads at home with those convictions of
his I dont see why it wouldnt be as tolerable there for old Lindau
himself

Well now said Mrs March let us put them all out of our minds and
see what we are going to do ourselves

They began to consider their ways and means and how and where they
should live in view of Marchs severance of his relations with Every
Other Week They had not saved anything from the first years salary
they had only prepared to save and they had nothing solid but their two
thousand to count upon But they built a future in which they easily
lived on that and on what March earned with his pen He became a free
lance and fought in whatever cause he thought just he had no ties no
chains They went back to Boston with the heroic will to do what was most
distasteful they would have returned to their own house if they had not
rented it again but any rate Mrs March helped out by taking boarders
or perhaps only letting rooms to lodgers They had some hard struggles
but they succeeded

The great thing she said is to be right Im ten times as happy as
if you had come home and told me that you had consented to do what
Dryfoos asked and he had doubled your salary

I dont think that would have happened in any event said March dryly

Well no matter I just used it for an example

They both experienced a buoyant relief such as seems to come to people
who begin life anew on whatever terms I hope we are young enough yet
Basil she said and she would not have it when he said they had once
been younger

They heard the childrens knock on the door they knocked when they came
home from school so that their mother might let them in Shall we tell
them at once she asked and ran to open for them before March could
answer

They were not alone Fulkerson smiling from ear to ear was with them
Is March in he asked

Mr March is at home yes she said very haughtily Hes in his
study and she led the way there while the children went to their
rooms

Well March Fulkerson called out at sight of him its all right The
old man has come down

I suppose if you gentlemen are going to talk business Mrs March
began

Oh we dont want you to go away said Fulkerson I reckon March has
told you anyway

Yes Ive told her said March Dont go Isabel What do you mean
Fulkerson

Hes just gone on up home and he sent me round with his apologies He
sees now that he had no business to speak to you as he did and he
withdraws everything Hed a come round himself if Id said so but I
told him I could make it all right

Fulkerson looked so happy in having the whole affair put right and the
Marches knew him to be so kindly affected toward them that they could
not refuse for the moment to share his mood They felt themselves
slipping down from the moral height which they had gained and March made
a clutch to stay himself with the question And Lindau

Well said Fulkerson hes going to leave Lindau to me You wont have
anything to do with it Ill let the old fellow down easy

Do you mean asked March that Mr Dryfoos insists on his being
dismissed

Why there isnt any dismissing about it Fulkerson argued If you
dont send him any more work he wont do any more thats all Or if he
comes round you canHes to be referred to me

March shook his head and his wife with a sigh felt herself plucked up
from the soft circumstance of their lives which she had sunk back into
so quickly and set beside him on that cold peak of principle again It
wont do Fulkerson Its very good of you and all that but it comes to
the same thing in the end I could have gone on without any apology from
Mr Dryfoos he transcended his authority but thats a minor matter I
could have excused it to his ignorance of life among gentlemen but I
cant consent to Lindaus dismissalit comes to that whether you do it
or I do it and whether its a positive or a negative thingbecause he
holds this opinion or that

But dont you see said Fulkerson that its just Lindaus opinions
the old man cant stand He hasnt got anything against him personally I
dont suppose theres anybody that appreciates Lindau in some ways more
than the old man does

I understand He wants to punish him for his opinions Well I cant
consent to that directly or indirectly We dont print his opinions and
he has a perfect right to hold them whether Mr Dryfoos agrees with them
or not

Mrs March had judged it decorous for her to say nothing but she now
went and sat down in the chair next her husband

Ah dog on it cried Fulkerson rumpling his hair with both his hands
What am I to do The old man says hes got to go

And I dont consent to his going said March

And you wont stay if he goes

Fulkerson rose Well well Ive got to see about it Im afraid the old
man wont stand it March I am indeed I wish youd reconsider IId
take it as a personal favor if you would It leaves me in a fix You see
Ive got to side with one or the other

March made no reply to this except to say Yes you must stand by him
or you must stand by me

Well well Hold on awhile Ill see you in the morning Dont take any
steps

Oh there are no steps to take said March with a melancholy smile
The steps are stopped thats all He sank back into his chair when
Fulkerson was gone and drew a long breath This is pretty rough I
thought we had got through it

No said his wife It seems as if I had to make the fight all over
again

Well its a good thing its a holy war

I cant bear the suspense Why didnt you tell him outright you wouldnt
go back on any terms

I might as well and got the glory Hell never move Dryfoos I suppose
we both would like to go back if we could

Oh I suppose so

They could not regain their lost exaltation their lost dignity At
dinner Mrs March asked the children how they would like to go back to
Boston to live

Why were not going are we asked Tom without enthusiasm

I was just wondering how you felt about it now she said with an
underlook at her husband

Well if we go back said Bella I want to live on the Back Bay Its
awfully Micky at the South End

I suppose I should go to Harvard said Tom and Id room out at
Cambridge It would be easier to get at you on the Back Bay

The parents smiled ruefully at each other and in view of these grand
expectations of his children March resolved to go as far as he could in
meeting Dryfooss wishes He proposed the theatre as a distraction from
the anxieties that he knew were pressing equally on his wife We might
go to the Old Homestead he suggested with a sad irony which only
his wife felt

Oh yes lets cried Bella

While they were getting ready someone rang and Bella went to the door
and then came to tell her father that it was Mr Lindau He says he
wants to see you just a moment Hes in the parlor and he wont sit
down or anything

What can he want groaned Mrs March from their common dismay

March apprehended a storm in the old mans face But he only stood in the
middle of the room looking very sad and grave You are Going oudt he
said I wont geep you long I haf gome to pring pack dose macassines
and dis mawney I cant do any more voark for you and I cant geep the
mawney you haf baid me aready It iss not hawnest mawneythat hass been
oarned py voark it iss mawney that hass peen mate py sbeculation and
the obbression off lapor and the necessity of the boor py a manHere
it is efery tollar efery zent Dake it I feel as if dere vas ploodt on
it

Why Lindau March began but the old man interrupted him

Tont dalk to me Passil I could not haf believedt it of you When you
know how I feel about dose tings why tidnt you dell me whose mawney you
bay oudt to me Ach I tont plame youI tont rebroach you You haf
nefer thought of it boat I have thought and I should be Guilty I must
share that mans Guilt if I gept hiss mawney If you hat toldt me at the
peginningif you hat peen frank with me boat it iss all righdt you can

to myself But I geep my handts glean voark or sdarfe Gif him hiss
mawney pack I am sawry for him I would not hoart hiss feelings boat I
could not pear to douch him and hiss mawney iss like boison

March tried to reason with Lindau to show him the folly the injustice
the absurdity of his course it ended in their both getting angry and in
Lindaus going away in a whirl of German that included Basil in the guilt
of the man whom Lindau called his master

Well said Mrs March He is a crank and I think youre well rid of
him Now you have no quarrel with that horrid old Dryfoos and you can
keep right on

Yes said March I wish it didnt make me feel so sneaking What a
long day its been It seems like a century since I got up

Yes a thousand years Is there anything else left to happen

I hope not Id like to go to bed

Why arent you going to the theatre wailed Bella coming in upon her
fathers desperate expression

The theatre Oh yes certainly I meant after we got home and March
amused himself at the puzzled countenance of the child Come on Is Tom
ready




IX

Fulkerson parted with the Marches in such trouble of mind that he did not
feel able to meet that night the people whom he usually kept so gay at
Mrs Leightons table He went to Maronis for his dinner for this
reason and for others more obscure He could not expect to do anything
more with Dryfoos at once he knew that Dryfoos must feel that he had
already made an extreme concession to March and he believed that if he
was to get anything more from him it must be after Dryfoos had dined But
he was not without the hope vague and indefinite as it might be that he
should find Lindau at Maronis and perhaps should get some concession
from him some word of regret or apology which he could report to
Dryfoos and at lest make the means of reopening the affair with him
perhaps Lindau when he knew how matters stood would back down
altogether and for Marchs sake would withdraw from all connection with
Every Other Week himself and so leave everything serene Fulkerson
felt capable in his desperation of delicately suggesting such a course
to Lindau or even of plainly advising it he did not care for Lindau a
great deal and he did care a great deal for the magazine

But he did not find Lindau at Maronis he only found Beaton He sat
looking at the doorway as Fulkerson entered and Fulkerson naturally came
and took a place at his table Something in Beatons largeeyed solemnity
of aspect invited Fulkerson to confidence and he said as he pulled his
napkin open and strung it still a little damp as the scanty
oftenwashed linen at Maronis was apt to be across his knees I was
looking for you this morning to talk with you about the Christmas
number and I was a good deal worked up because I couldnt find you but
I guess I might as well have spared myself my emotions

Why asked Beaton briefly

Well I dont know as theres going to be any Christmas number

Why Beaton asked again

Row between the financial angel and the literary editor about the chief
translator and polyglot smeller

Lindau

Lindau is his name

What does the literary editor expect after Lindaus expression of his
views last night

I dont know what he expected but the ground he took with the old man
was that as Lindaus opinions didnt characterize his work on the
magazine he would not be made the instrument of punishing him for them
the old man wanted him turned off as he calls it

Seems to be pretty good ground said Beaton impartially while he
speculated with a dull trouble at heart on the effect the row would
have on his own fortunes His late visit home had made him feel that the
claim of his family upon him for some repayment of help given could not
be much longer delayed with his mother sick and his father growing old
he must begin to do something for them but up to this time he had spent
his salary even faster than he had earned it When Fulkerson came in he
was wondering whether he could get him to increase it if he threatened
to give up his work and he wished that he was enough in love with
Margaret Vance or even Christine Dryfoos to marry her only to end in
the sorrowful conviction that he was really in love with Alma Leighton
who had no money and who had apparently no wish to be married for love
even And what are you going to do about it he asked listlessly

Be dogged if I know what Im going to do about it said Fulkerson
Ive been round all day trying to pick up the piecesrow began right
after breakfast this morningand one time I thought Id got the thing
all put together again I got the old man to say that he had spoken to
March a little too authoritatively about Lindau that in fact he ought
to have communicated his wishes through me and that he was willing to
have me get rid of Lindau and March neednt have anything to do with it
I thought that was pretty white but March says the apologies and regrets
are all well enough in their way but they leave the main question where
they found it

What is the main question Beaton asked pouring himself out some
Chianti As he set the flask down he made the reflection that if he would
drink water instead of Chianti he could send his father three dollars a
week on his back debts and he resolved to do it

The main question as March looks at it is the question of punishing
Lindau for his private opinions he says that if he consents to my
bouncing the old fellow its the same as if he bounced him

It might have that complexion in some lights said Beaton He drank off
his Chianti and thought he would have it twice a week or make Maroni
keep the halfbottles over for him and send his father two dollars And
what are you going to do now

Thats what I dont know said Fulkerson ruefully After a moment he
said desperately Beaton youve got a pretty good head why dont you
suggest something

Why dont you let March go Beaton suggested

Ah I couldnt said Fulkerson I got him to break up in Boston and
come here I like him nobody else could get the hang of the thing like
he has hesa friend Fulkerson said this with the nearest approach he
could make to seriousness which was a kind of unhappiness

Beaton shrugged Oh if you can afford to have ideals I congratulate
you Theyre too expensive for me Then suppose you get rid of Dryfoos

Fulkerson laughed forlornly Go on Bildad Like to sprinkle a few ashes
over my boils Dont mind me

They both sat silent a little while and then Beaton said I suppose you
havent seen Dryfoos the second time

No I came in here to gird up my loins with a little dinner before I
tackled him But something seems to be the matter with Maronis cook I
dont want anything to eat

The cookings about as bad as usual said Beaton After a moment he
added ironically for he found Fulkersons misery a kind of relief from
his own and was willing to protract it as long as it was amusing Why
not try an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary

What do you mean

Get that other old fool to go to Dryfoos for you

Which other old fool The old fools seem to be as thick as flies

That Southern one

Colonel Woodburn

Mmmmm

He did seem to rather take to the colonel Fulkerson mused aloud

Of course he did Woodburn with his idiotic talk about patriarchal
slavery is the man on horseback to Dryfooss muddy imagination Hed
listen to him abjectly and hed do whatever Woodburn told him to do
Beaton smiled cynically

Fulkerson got up and reached for his coat and hat Youve struck it old
man The waiter came up to help him on with his coat Fulkerson slipped
a dollar in his hand Never mind the coat you can give the rest of my
dinner to the poor Paolo Beaton shake Youve saved my life little
boy though I dont think you meant it He took Beatons hand and
solemnly pressed it and then almost ran out of the door

They had just reached coffee at Mrs Leightons when he arrived and sat
down with them and began to put some of the life of his new hope into
them His appetite revived and after protesting that he would not take
anything but coffee he went back and ate some of the earlier courses
But with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward he did not
conceal from Miss Woodburn at least that he was eager to get her apart
from the rest for some reason When he accomplished this it seemed as if
he had contrived it all himself but perhaps he had not wholly contrived
it

Im so glad to get a chance to speak to you alone he said at once and
while she waited for the next word he made a pause and then said
desperately I want you to help me and if you cant help me theres no
help for me

Mah goodness she said is the case so bad as that What in the woald
is the trouble

Yes its a bad case said Fulkerson I want your father to help me

Oh I thoat you said me

Yes I want you to help me with your father I suppose I ought to go to
him at once but Im a little afraid of him

And you awe not afraid of me I dont think thats very flattering Mr
Fulkerson You ought to think Ahm twahce as awful as papa

Oh I do You see Im quite paralyzed before you and so I dont feel
anything

Well its a pretty lahvely kyand of paralysis Butgo on

I willI will If I can only begin

Pohaps Ah maght begin fo you

No you cant Lord knows Id like to let you Well its like this

Fulkerson made a clutch at his hair and then after another hesitation
he abruptly laid the whole affair before her He did not think it
necessary to state the exact nature of the offence Lindau had given
Dryfoos for he doubted if she could grasp it and he was profuse of his
excuses for troubling her with the matter and of wonder at himself for
having done so In the rapture of his concern at having perhaps made a
fool of himself he forgot why he had told her but she seemed to like
having been confided in and she said Well Ah dont see what you can
do with you ahdeals of friendship except stand bah Mr Mawch

My ideals of friendship What do you mean

Oh dont you suppose we know Mr Beaton said you we a pofect Bahyard
in friendship and you would sacrifice anything to it

Is that so said Fulkerson thinking how easily he could sacrifice
Lindau in this case He had never supposed before that he was chivalrous
in such matters but he now began to see it in that light and he
wondered that he could ever have entertained for a moment the idea of
throwing March over

But Ah most say Miss Woodburn went on Ah dont envy you you next
interview with Mr Dryfoos Ah suppose youll have to see him at once
aboat it

The conjecture recalled Fulkerson to the object of his confidences Ah
theres where your help comes in Ive exhausted all the influence I have
with Dryfoos

Good gracious you dont expect Ah could have any

They both laughed at the comic dismay with which she conveyed the
preposterous notion and Fulkerson said If I judged from myself I
should expect you to bring him round instantly

Oh thank you Mr Fulkerson she said with mock meekness

Not at all But it isnt Dryfoos I want you to help me with its your
father I want your father to interview Dryfoos for me and IIm afraid
to ask him

Poo Mr Fulkerson she said and she insinuated something through her
burlesque compassion that lifted him to the skies He swore in his heart
that the woman never lived who was so witty so wise so beautiful and
so good Come raght with me this minute if the cyoasts clea She
went to the door of the diningroom and looked in across its gloom to the
little gallery where her father sat beside a lamp reading his evening
paper Mrs Leighton could be heard in colloquy with the cook below and
Alma had gone to her room She beckoned Fulkerson with the hand
outstretched behind her and said Go and ask him

Alone he palpitated

Oh what a cyowahd she cried and went with him Ah suppose youll
want me to tell him aboat it

Well I wish youd begin Miss Woodburn he said The fact is you
know Ive been over it so much Im kind of sick of the thing

Miss Woodburn advanced and put her hand on her fathers shoulder Look
heah papa Mr Fulkerson wants to ask you something and he wants me to
do it fo him

The colonel looked up through his glasses with the sort of ferocity
elderly men sometimes have to put on in order to keep their glasses from
falling off His daughter continued Hes got into an awful difficulty
with his edito and his proprieto and he wants you to pacify them

I do not know whethah I understand the case exactly said the colonel
but Mr Fulkerson may command me to the extent of my ability

You dont understand it aftah what Ahve said cried the girl Then Ah
dont see but what youll have to explain it youself Mr Fulkerson

Well Miss Woodburn has been so luminous about it colonel said
Fulkerson glad of the joking shape she had given the affair that I can
only throw in a little sidelight here and there

The colonel listened as Fulkerson went on with a grave diplomatic
satisfaction He felt gratified honored even he said by Mr
Fulkersons appeal to him and probably it gave him something of the high
joy that an affair of honor would have brought him in the days when he
had arranged for meetings between gentlemen Next to bearing a challenge
this work of composing a difficulty must have been grateful But he gave
no outward sign of his satisfaction in making a resume of the case so as
to get the points clearly in his mind

I was afraid sir he said with the state due to the serious nature of
the facts that Mr Lindau had given Mr Dryfoos offence by some of his
questions at the dinnertable last night

Perfect red rag to a bull Fulkerson put in and then he wanted to
withdraw his words at the colonels look of displeasure

I have no reflections to make upon Mr Landau Colonel Woodburn
continued and Fulkerson felt grateful to him for going on I do not
agree with Mr Lindau I totally disagree with him on sociological
points but the course of the conversation had invited him to the
expression of his convictions and he had a right to express them so far
as they had no personal bearing

Of course said Fulkerson while Miss Woodburn perched on the arm of
her fathers chair

At the same time sir I think that if Mr Dryfoos felt a personal
censure in Mr Lindaus questions concerning his suppression of the
strike among his workmen he had a right to resent it

Exactly Fulkerson assented

But it must be evident to you sir that a highspirited gentleman like
Mr MarchI confess that my feelings are with him very warmly in the
mattercould not submit to dictation of the nature you describe

Yes I see said Fulkerson and with that strange duplex action of the
human mind he wished that it was his hair and not her fathers that
Miss Woodburn was poking apart with the corner of her fan

Mr Lindau the colonel concluded was right from his point of view
and Mr Dryfoos was equally right The position of Mr March is perfectly
correct

His daughter dropped to her feet from his chairarm Mah goodness If
nobodys in the wrong ho awe you evah going to get the mattah
straight

Yes you see Fulkerson added nobody can give in

Pardon me said the colonel the case is one in which all can give
in

I dont know which ll begin said Fulkerson

The colonel rose Mr Lindau must begin sir We must begin by seeing
Mr Lindau and securing from him the assurance that in the expression of
his peculiar views he had no intention of offering any personal offence
to Mr Dryfoos If I have formed a correct estimate of Mr Lindau this
will be perfectly simple

Fulkerson shook his head But it wouldnt help Dryfoos dont care a rap
whether Lindau meant any personal offence or not As far as that is
concerned hes got a hide like a hippopotamus But what he hates is
Lindaus opinions and what he says is that no man who holds such
opinions shall have any work from him And what March says is that no man
shall be punished through him for his opinions he dont care what they
are

The colonel stood a moment in silence And what do you expect me to do
under the circumstances

I came to you for adviceI thought you might suggest

Do you wish me to see Mr Dryfoos

Well thats about the size of it Fulkerson admitted You see
colonel he hastened on I know that you have a great deal of influence
with him that article of yours is about the only thing hes ever read in
Every Other Week and hes proud of your acquaintance Well you
knowand here Fulkerson brought in the figure that struck him so much
in Beatons phrase and had been on his tongue ever sinceyoure the
man on horseback to him and hed be more apt to do what you say than if
anybody else said it

You are very good sir said the colonel trying to be proof against
the flattery but I am afraid you overrate my influence Fulkerson let
him ponder it silently and his daughter governed her impatience by
holding her fan against her lips Whatever the process was in the
colonels mind he said at last I see no good reason for declining to
act for you Mr Fulkerson and I shall be very happy if I can be of
service to you Buthe stopped Fulkerson from cutting in with
precipitate thanksI think I have a right sir to ask what your course
will be in the event of failure

Failure Fulkerson repeated in dismay

Yes sir I will not conceal from you that this mission is one not
wholly agreeable to my feelings

Oh I understand that colonel and I assure you that I appreciate I

There is no use trying to blink the fact sir that there are certain
aspects of Mr Dryfooss character in which he is not a gentleman We
have alluded to this fact before and I need not dwell upon it now I may
say however that my misgivings were not wholly removed last night

No Fulkerson assented though in his heart he thought the old man had
behaved very well

What I wish to say now is that I cannot consent to act for you in this
matter merely as an intermediary whose failure would leave the affair in
state quo

I see said Fulkerson

And I should like some intimation some assurance as to which party
your own feelings are with in the difference

The colonel bent his eyes sharply on Fulkerson Miss Woodburn let hers
fall Fulkerson felt that he was being tested and he said to gain time
As between Lindau and Dryfoos though he knew this was not the point

As between Mr Dryfoos and Mr March said the colonel

Fulkerson drew a long breath and took his courage in both hands There
cant be any choice for me in such a case Im for March every time

The colonel seized his hand and Miss Woodburn said If there had been
any choice fo you in such a case I should never have let papa stir a
step with you

Why in regard to that said the colonel with a literal application
of the idea was it your intention that we should both go

Well I dont know I suppose it was

I think it will be better for me to go alone said the colonel and
with a color from his experience in affairs of honor he added In these
matters a principal cannot appear without compromising his dignity I
believe I have all the points clearly in mind and I think I should act
more freely in meeting Mr Dryfoos alone

Fulkerson tried to hide the eagerness with which he met these agreeable
views He felt himself exalted in some sort to the level of the colonels
sentiments though it would not be easy to say whether this was through
the desperation bred of having committed himself to Marchs side or
through the buoyant hope he had that the colonel would succeed in his
mission

Im not afraid to talk with Dryfoos about it he said

There is no question of courage said the colonel It is a question of
dignityof personal dignity

Well dont let that delay you papa said his daughter following him
to the door where she found him his hat and Fulkerson helped him on
with his overcoat Ah shall be jost wald to know ho its toned oat

Wont you let me go up to the house with you Fulkerson began I
neednt go in

I prefer to go alone said the colonel I wish to turn the points over
in my mind and I am afraid you would find me rather dull company

He went out and Fulkerson returned with Miss Woodburn to the
drawingroom where she said the Leightons were They were not there
but she did not seem disappointed

Well Mr Fulkerson she said you have got an ahdeal of friendship
sure enough

Me said Fulkerson Oh my Lord Dont you see I couldnt do anything
else And Im scared half to death anyway If the colonel dont bring
the old man round I reckon its all up with me But hell fetch him And
Im just prostrated with gratitude to you Miss Woodburn

She waved his thanks aside with her fan What do you mean by its being
all up with you

Why if the old man sticks to his position and I stick to March weve
both got to go overboard together Dryfoos owns the magazine he can stop
it or he can stop us which amounts to the same thing as far as were
concerned

And then what the girl pursued

And then nothingtill we pick ourselves up

Do you mean that Mr Dryfoos will put you both oat of your places

He may

And Mr Mawch takes the risk of that jost fo a principle

I reckon

And you do it jost fo an ahdeal

It wont do to own it I must have my little axe to grind somewhere

Well men awe splendid sighed the girl Ah will say it

Oh theyre not so much better than women said Fulkerson with a
nervous jocosity I guess March would have backed down if it hadnt been
for his wife She was as hot as pepper about it and you could see that
she would have sacrificed all her husbands relations sooner than let him
back down an inch from the stand he had taken Its pretty easy for a man
to stick to a principle if he has a woman to stand by him But when you
come to play it alone

Mr Fulkerson said the girl solemnly Ah will stand bah you in this
if all the woald tones against you The tears came into her eyes and
she put out her hand to him

You will he shouted in a rapture In every wayand alwaysas long
as you live Do you mean it He had caught her hand to his breast and
was grappling it tight there and drawing her to him

The changing emotions chased one another through her heart and over her
face dismay shame pride tenderness You dont believe she said
hoarsely that Ah meant that

No but I hope you do mean it for if you dont nothing else means
anything

There was no space there was only a point of wavering Ah do mean it

When they lifted their eyes from each other again it was halfpast ten
No you most go she said

But the colonelour fate

The conel is often oat late and Ahm not afraid of ouah fate no that
weve taken it into ouah own hands She looked at him with dewy eyes of
trust of inspiration

Oh its going to come out all right he said It cant come out wrong
now no matter what happens But whod have thought it when I came into
this house in such a state of sin and misery half an hour ago

Three houahs and a half ago she said No you most jost go Ahm
tahed to death Goodnight You can come in the mawning to seepapa She
opened the door and pushed him out with enrapturing violence and he ran
laughing down the steps into her fathers arms

Why colonel I was just going up to meet you He had really thought he
would walk off his exultation in that direction

I am very sorry to say Mr Fulkerson the colonel began gravely
that Mr Dryfoos adheres to his position

Oh all right said Fulkerson with unabated joy Its what I
expected Well my course is clear I shall stand by March and I guess
the world wont come to an end if he bounces us both But Im
everlastingly obliged to you Colonel Woodburn and I dont know what to
say to you II wont detain you now its so late Ill see you in the
morning Goodni

Fulkerson did not realize that it takes two to part The colonel laid
hold of his arm and turned away with him I will walk toward your place
with you I can understand why you should be anxious to know the
particulars of my interview with Mr Dryfoos and in the statement which
followed he did not spare him the smallest It outlasted their walk and
detained them long on the steps of the Every Other Week building But
at the end Fulkerson let himself in with his key as light of heart as if
he had been listening to the gayest promises that fortune could make

By the tune he met March at the office next morning a little but only a
very little misgiving saddened his golden heaven He took Marchs hand
with high courage and said Well the old man sticks to his point
March He added with the sense of saying it before Miss Woodburn And
I stick by you Ive thought it all over and Id rather be right with
you than wrong with him

Well I appreciate your motive Fulkerson said March But
perhapsperhaps we can save over our heroics for another occasion
Lindau seems to have got in with his for the present

He told him of Lindaus last visit and they stood a moment looking at
each other rather queerly Fulkerson was the first to recover his
spirits Well he said cheerily that lets us out

Does it Im not sure it lets me out said March but he said this in
tribute to his crippled selfrespect rather than as a forecast of any
action in the matter

Why what are you going to do Fulkerson asked If Lindau wont work
for Dryfoos you cant make him

March sighed What are you going to do with this money He glanced at
the heap of bills he had flung on the table between them

Fulkerson scratched his head Ah dogged if I know Cant we give it to
the deserving poor somehow if we can find em

I suppose weve no right to use it in any way You must give it to
Dryfoos

To the deserving rich Well you can always find them I reckon you
dont want to appear in the transaction I dont either but I guess I
must Fulkerson gathered up the money and carried it to Conrad He
directed him to account for it in his books as consciencemoney and he
enjoyed the joke more than Conrad seemed to do when he was told where it
came from

Fulkerson was able to wear off the disagreeable impression the affair
left during the course of the forenoon and he met Miss Woodburn with
all a lovers buoyancy when he went to lunch She was as happy as he when
he told her how fortunately the whole thing had ended and he took her
view that it was a reward of his courage in having dared the worst They
both felt as the newly plighted always do that they were in the best
relations with the beneficent powers and that their felicity had been
especially looked to in the disposition of events They were in a glow of
rapturous content with themselves and radiant worship of each other she
was sure that he merited the bright future opening to them both as much
as if he owed it directly to some noble action of his own he felt that
he was indebted for the favor of Heaven entirely to the still incredible
accident of her preference of him over other men

Colonel Woodburn who was not yet in the secret of their love perhaps
failed for this reason to share their satisfaction with a result so
unexpectedly brought about The blessing on their hopes seemed to his
ignorance to involve certain sacrifices of personal feeling at which he
hinted in suggesting that Dryfoos should now be asked to make some
abstract concessions and acknowledgments his daughter hastened to deny
that these were at all necessary and Fulkerson easily explained why The
thing was over what was the use of opening it up again

Perhaps none the colonel admitted But he added I should like the
opportunity of taking Mr Lindaus hand in the presence of Mr Dryfoos
and assuring him that I considered him a man of principle and a man of
honora gentleman sir whom I was proud and happy to have known

Well Ahve no doabt said his daughter demurely that youll have
the chance some day and we would all lahke to join you But at the same
tahme Ah think Mr Fulkerson is well oat of it fo the present
