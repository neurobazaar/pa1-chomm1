Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The first Part of
Henry the Sixt




Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The first
Part of Henry the Sixt

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

The Comedie of Errors

Actus primus Scena prima

Enter the Duke of Ephesus with the Merchant of Siracusa Iaylor
and
other attendants

 Marchant Proceed Solinus to procure my fall
And by the doome of death end woes and all

 Duke Merchant of Siracusa plead no more
I am not partiall to infringe our Lawes
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke
To Merchants our welldealing Countrimen
Who wanting gilders to redeeme their liues
Haue seald his rigorous statutes with their blouds
Excludes all pitty from our threatning lookes
For since the mortall and intestine iarres
Twixt thy seditious Countrimen and vs
It hath in solemne Synodes beene decreed
Both by the Siracusians and our selues
To admit no trafficke to our aduerse townes
Nay more if any borne at Ephesus
Be seene at any Siracusian Marts and Fayres
Againe if any Siracusian borne
Come to the Bay of Ephesus he dies
His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose
Vnlesse a thousand markes be leuied
To quit the penalty and to ransome him
Thy substance valued at the highest rate
Cannot amount vnto a hundred Markes
Therefore by Law thou art condemnd to die

 Mer Yet this my comfort when your words are done
My woes end likewise with the euening Sonne

 Duk Well Siracusian say in briefe the cause
Why thou departedst from thy natiue home
And for what cause thou camst to Ephesus

 Mer A heauier taske could not haue beene imposd
Then I to speake my griefes vnspeakeable
Yet that the world may witnesse that my end
Was wrought by nature not by vile offence
Ile vtter what my sorrow giues me leaue
In Syracusa was I borne and wedde
Vnto a woman happy but for me
And by me had not our hap beene bad
With her I liud in ioy our wealth increast
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamium till my factors death
And he great care of goods at randone left
Drew me from kinde embracements of my spouse
From whom my absence was not sixe moneths olde
Before her selfe almost at fainting vnder
The pleasing punishment that women beare
Had made prouision for her following me
And soone and safe arriued where I was
There had she not beene long but she became
A ioyfull mother of two goodly sonnes
And which was strange the one so like the other
As could not be distinguishd but by names
That very howre and in the selfesame Inne
A meane woman was deliuered
Of such a burthen Male twins both alike
Those for their parents were exceeding poore
I bought and brought vp to attend my sonnes
My wife not meanely prowd of two such boyes
Made daily motions for our home returne
Vnwilling I agreed alas too soone wee came aboord
A league from Epidamium had we saild
Before the alwaies windeobeying deepe
Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme
But longer did we not retaine much hope
For what obscured light the heauens did grant
Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes
A doubtfull warrant of immediate death
Which though my selfe would gladly haue imbracd
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife
Weeping before for what she saw must come
And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes
That mournd for fashion ignorant what to feare
Forst me to seeke delayes for them and me
And this it was for other meanes was none
The Sailors sought for safety by our boate
And left the ship then sinking ripe to vs
My wife more carefull for the latter borne
Had fastned him vnto a small spare Mast
Such as seafaring men prouide for stormes
To him one of the other twins was bound
Whilst I had beene like heedfull of the other
The children thus disposd my wife and I
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt
Fastned our selues at eyther end the mast
And floating straight obedient to the streame
Was carried towards Corinth as we thought
At length the sonne gazing vpon the earth
Disperst those vapours that offended vs
And by the benefit of his wished light
The seas waxt calme and we discouered
Two shippes from farre making amaine to vs
Of Corinth that of Epidarus this
But ere they came oh let me say no more
Gather the sequell by that went before

 Duk Nay forward old man doe not breake off so
For we may pitty though not pardon thee

 Merch Oh had the gods done so I had not now
Worthily tearmd them mercilesse to vs
For ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues
We were encountred by a mighty rocke
Which being violently borne vp
Our helpefull ship was splitted in the midst
So that in this vniust diuorce of vs
Fortune had left to both of vs alike
What to delight in what to sorrow for
Her part poore soule seeming as burdened
With lesser waight but not with lesser woe
Was carried with more speed before the winde
And in our sight they three were taken vp
By Fishermen of Corinth as we thought
At length another ship had seizd on vs
And knowing whom it was their hap to saue
Gaue healthfull welcome to their shipwrackt guests
And would haue reft the Fishers of their prey
Had not their backe beene very slow of saile
And therefore homeward did they bend their course
Thus haue you heard me seuerd from my blisse
That by misfortunes was my life prolongd
To tell sad stories of my owne mishaps

 Duke And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
Doe me the fauour to dilate at full
What haue befalne of them and they till now

 Merch My yongest boy and yet my eldest care
At eighteene yeeres became inquisitiue
After his brother and importund me
That his attendant so his case was like
Reft of his brother but retaind his name
Might beare him company in the quest of him
Whom whilst I laboured of a loue to see
I hazarded the losse of whom I loud
Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest Greece
Roming cleane through the bounds of Asia
And coasting homeward came to Ephesus
Hopelesse to finde yet loth to leaue vnsought
Or that or any place that harbours men
But heere must end the story of my life
And happy were I in my timelie death
Could all my trauells warrant me they liue

 Duke Haplesse Egeon whom the fates haue markt
To beare the extremitie of dire mishap
Now trust me were it not against our Lawes
Against my Crowne my oath my dignity
Which Princes would they may not disanull
My soule should sue as aduocate for thee
But though thou art adiudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recald
But to our honours great disparagement
Yet will I fauour thee in what I can
Therefore Marchant Ile limit thee this day
To seeke thy helpe by beneficiall helpe
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus
Beg thou or borrow to make vp the summe
And liue if no then thou art doomd to die
Iaylor take him to thy custodie

 Iaylor I will my Lord

 Merch Hopelesse and helpelesse doth Egean wend
But to procrastinate his liuelesse end

Exeunt

Enter Antipholis Erotes a Marchant and Dromio

 Mer Therefore giue out you are of Epidamium
Lest that your goods too soone be confiscate
This very day a Syracusian Marchant
Is apprehended for a riuall here
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the towne
Dies ere the wearie sunne set in the West
There is your monie that I had to keepe

 Ant Goe beare it to the Centaure where we host
And stay there Dromio till I come to thee
Within this houre it will be dinner time
Till that Ile view the manners of the towne
Peruse the traders gaze vpon the buildings
And then returne and sleepe within mine Inne
For with long trauaile I am stiffe and wearie
Get thee away

 Dro Many a man would take you at your word
And goe indeede hauing so good a meane

Exit Dromio

 Ant A trustie villaine sir that very oft
When I am dull with care and melancholly
Lightens my humour with his merry iests
What will you walke with me about the towne
And then goe to my Inne and dine with me
 EMar I am inuited sir to certaine Marchants
Of whom I hope to make much benefit
I craue your pardon soone at fiue a clocke
Please you Ile meete with you vpon the Mart
And afterward consort you till bed time
My present businesse cals me from you now

 Ant Farewell till then I will goe loose my selfe
And wander vp and downe to view the Citie

 EMar Sir I commend you to your owne content

Exeunt

 Ant He that commends me to mine owne content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the Ocean seekes another drop
Who falling there to finde his fellow forth
Vnseene inquisitiue confounds himselfe
So I to finde a Mother and a Brother
In quest of them vnhappie a loose my selfe

Enter Dromio of Ephesus

Here comes the almanacke of my true date
What now How chance thou art returnd so soone

 EDro Returnd so soone rather approacht too late
The Capon burnes the Pig fals from the spit
The clocke hath strucken twelue vpon the bell
My Mistris made it one vpon my cheeke
She is so hot because the meate is colde
The meate is colde because you come not home
You come not home because you haue no stomacke
You haue no stomacke hauing broke your fast
But we that know what tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to day

 Ant Stop in your winde sir tell me this I pray
Where haue you left the mony that I gaue you

 EDro Oh sixe pence that I had a wensday last
To pay the Sadler for my Mistris crupper
The Sadler had it Sir I kept it not

 Ant I am not in a sportiue humor now
Tell me and dally not where is the monie
We being strangers here how darst thou trust
So great a charge from thine owne custodie

 EDro I pray you iest sir as you sit at dinner
I from my Mistris come to you in post
If I returne I shall be post indeede
For she will scoure your fault vpon my pate
Me thinkes your maw like mine should be your cooke
And strike you home without a messenger

 Ant Come Dromio come these iests are out of season
Reserue them till a merrier houre then this
Where is the gold I gaue in charge to thee
 EDro To me sir why you gaue no gold to me
 Ant Come on sir knaue haue done your foolishnes
And tell me how thou hast disposd thy charge

 EDro My charge was but to fetch you from the Mart
Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner
My Mistris and her sister staies for you

 Ant Now as I am a Christian answer me
In what safe place you haue bestowd my monie
Or I shall breake that merrie sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am vndisposd
Where is the thousand Markes thou hadst of me
 EDro I haue some markes of yours vpon my pate
Some of my Mistris markes vpon my shoulders
But not a thousand markes betweene you both
If I should pay your worship those againe
Perchance you will not beare them patiently

 Ant Thy Mistris markes what Mistris slaue hast thou
 EDro Your worships wife my Mistris at the Phoenix
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner
And praies that you will hie you home to dinner

 Ant What wilt thou flout me thus vnto my face
Being forbid There take you that sir knaue

 EDro What meane you sir for God sake hold your hands
Nay and you will not sir Ile take my heeles

Exeunt Dromio Ep

 Ant Vpon my life by some deuise or other
The villaine is orewrought of all my monie
They say this towne is full of cosenage
As nimble Iuglers that deceiue the eie
Darke working Sorcerers that change the minde
Soulekilling Witches that deforme the bodie
Disguised Cheaters prating Mountebankes
And manie such like liberties of sinne
If it proue so I will be gone the sooner
Ile to the Centaur to goe seeke this slaue
I greatly feare my monie is not safe

Enter


Actus Secundus

Enter Adriana wife to Antipholis Sereptus with Luciana her
Sister

 Adr Neither my husband nor the slaue returnd
That in such haste I sent to seeke his Master
Sure Luciana it is two a clocke

 Luc Perhaps some Merchant hath inuited him
And from the Mart hes somewhere gone to dinner
Good Sister let vs dine and neuer fret
A man is Master of his libertie
Time is their Master and when they see time
Theyll goe or come if so be patient Sister

 Adr Why should their libertie then ours be more
 Luc Because their businesse still lies out adore

 Adr Looke when I serue him so he takes it thus

 Luc Oh know he is the bridle of your will

 Adr Theres none but asses will be bridled so

 Luc Why headstrong liberty is lasht with woe
Theres nothing situate vnder heauens eye
But hath his bound in earth in sea in skie
The beasts the fishes and the winged fowles
Are their males subiects and at their controules
Man more diuine the Master of all these
Lord of the wide world and wilde watry seas
Indued with intellectuall sence and soules
Of more preheminence then fish and fowles
Are masters to their females and their Lords
Then let your will attend on their accords

 Adri This seruitude makes you to keepe vnwed

 Luci Not this but troubles of the marriage bed

 Adr But were you wedded you wold bear some sway
 Luc Ere I learne loue Ile practise to obey

 Adr How if your husband start some other where
 Luc Till he come home againe I would forbeare

 Adr Patience vnmoud no maruel though she pause
They can be meeke that haue no other cause
A wretched soule bruisd with aduersitie
We bid be quiet when we heare it crie
But were we burdned with like waight of paine
As much or more we should our selues complaine
So thou that hast no vnkinde mate to greeue thee
With vrging helpelesse patience would releeue me
But if thou liue to see like right bereft
This foolebegd patience in thee will be left

 Luci Well I will marry one day but to trie
Heere comes your man now is your husband nie

Enter Dromio Eph

 Adr Say is your tardie master now at hand
 EDro Nay hees at too hands with mee and that my
two eares can witnesse

 Adr Say didst thou speake with him knowst thou
his minde
 EDro I I he told his minde vpon mine eare
Beshrew his hand I scarce could vnderstand it

 Luc Spake hee so doubtfully thou couldst not feele
his meaning

 EDro Nay hee strooke so plainly I could too well
feele his blowes and withall so doubtfully that I could
scarce vnderstand them

 Adri But say I prethee is he comming home
It seemes he hath great care to please his wife

 EDro Why Mistresse sure my Master is horne mad

 Adri Horne mad thou villaine
 EDro I meane not Cuckold mad
But sure he is starke mad
When I desird him to come home to dinner
He askd me for a hundred markes in gold
Tis dinner time quoth I my gold quoth he
Your meat doth burne quoth I my gold quoth he
Will you come quoth I my gold quoth he
Where is the thousand markes I gaue thee villaine
The Pigge quoth I is burnd my gold quoth he
My mistresse sir quoth I hang vp thy Mistresse
I know not thy mistresse out on thy mistresse

 Luci Quoth who
 EDr Quoth my Master I know quoth he no house
no wife no mistresse so that my arrant due vnto my
tongue I thanke him I bare home vpon my shoulders
for in conclusion he did beat me there

 Adri Go back againe thou slaue  fetch him home

 Dro Goe backe againe and be new beaten home
For Gods sake send some other messenger

 Adri Backe slaue or I will breake thy pate acrosse

 Dro And he will blesse y crosse with other beating
Betweene you I shall haue a holy head

 Adri Hence prating pesant fetch thy Master home

 Dro Am I so round with you as you with me
That like a football you doe spurne me thus
You spurne me hence and he will spurne me hither
If I last in this seruice you must case me in leather

 Luci Fie how impatience lowreth in your face

 Adri His company must do his minions grace
Whilst I at home starue for a merrie looke
Hath homelie age th alluring beauty tooke
From my poore cheeke then he hath wasted it
Are my discourses dull Barren my wit
If voluble and sharpe discourse be mard
Vnkindnesse blunts it more then marble hard
Doe their gay vestments his affections baite
Thats not my fault hees master of my state
What ruines are in me that can be found
By him not ruind Then is he the ground
Of my defeatures My decayed faire
A sunnie looke of his would soone repaire
But too vnruly Deere he breakes the pale
And feedes from home poore I am but his stale

 Luci Selfeharming Iealousie fie beat it hence

 Ad Vnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispence
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
Or else what lets it but he would be here
Sister you know he promisd me a chaine
Would that alone a loue he would detaine
So he would keepe faire quarter with his bed
I see the Iewell best enamaled
Will loose his beautie yet the gold bides still
That others touch and often touching will

Enter Antipholis Errotis

 Ant The gold I gaue to Dromio is laid vp
Safe at the Centaur and the heedfull slaue

By computation and mine hosts report
I could not speake with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the Mart see here he comes

Enter Dromio Siracusia

How now sir is your merrie humor alterd

 SDro What answer sir when spake I such a word
 EAnt Euen now euen here not halfe an howre since

 SDro I did not see you since you sent me hence
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gaue me

 Ant Villaine thou didst denie the golds receit
And toldst me of a Mistresse and a dinner
For which I hope thou feltst I was displeasd

 SDro I am glad to see you in this merrie vaine
What meanes this iest I pray you Master tell me
 Ant Yea dost thou ieere  flowt me in the teeth
Thinkst y I iest hold take thou that  that

Beats Dro

 SDr Hold sir for Gods sake now your iest is earnest
Vpon what bargaine do you giue it me
 Antiph Because that I familiarlie sometimes
Doe vse you for my foole and chat with you
Your sawcinesse will iest vpon my loue
And make a Common of my serious howres
When the sunne shines let foolish gnats make sport
But creepe in crannies when he hides his beames
If you will iest with me know my aspect
And fashion your demeanor to my lookes
Or I will beat this method in your sconce

 SDro Sconce call you it so you would leaue battering
I had rather haue it a head and you vse these blows
long I must get a sconce for my head and Insconce it
to or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders but I pray
sir why am I beaten
 Ant Dost thou not know
 SDro Nothing sir but that I am beaten

 Ant Shall I tell you why
 SDro I sir and wherefore for they say euery why
hath a wherefore

 Ant Why first for flowting me and then wherefore
for vrging it the second time to me

 SDro Was there euer anie man thus beaten out of
season when in the why and the wherefore is neither
rime nor reason Well sir I thanke you

 Ant Thanke me sir for what
 SDro Marry sir for this something that you gaue me
for nothing

 Ant Ile make you amends next to giue you nothing

 SDro No sir I thinke the meat wants that I haue

 Ant In good time sir whats that
 SDro Basting

 Ant Well sir learne to iest in good time theres a
time for all things

 SDro I durst haue denied that before you were so
chollericke

 Anti By what rule sir
 SDro Marry sir by a rule as plaine as the plaine bald
pate of Father time himselfe

 Ant Lets heare it

 SDro Theres no time for a man to recouer his haire
that growes bald by nature

 Ant May he not doe it by fine and recouerie
 SDro Yes to pay a fine for a perewig and recouer
the lost haire of another man

 Ant Why is Time such a niggard of haire being as
it is so plentifull an excrement
 SDro Because it is a blessing that hee bestowes on
beasts and what he hath scanted them in haire hee hath
giuen them in wit

 Ant Why but theres manie a man hath more haire
then wit

 SDro Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose
his haire

 Ant Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers
without wit

 SDro The plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he looseth
it in a kinde of iollitie

 An For what reason

 SDro For two and sound ones to

 An Nay not sound I pray you

 SDro Sure ones then

 An Nay not sure in a thing falsing

 SDro Certaine ones then

 An Name them

 SDro The one to saue the money that he spends in
trying the other that at dinner they should not drop in
his porrage

 An You would all this time haue proud there is no
time for all things

 SDro Marry and did sir namely in no time to recouer
haire lost by Nature

 An But your reason was not substantiall why there
is no time to recouer

 SDro Thus I mend it Time himselfe is bald and
therefore to the worlds end will haue bald followers

 An I knew twould be a bald conclusion but soft
who wafts vs yonder

Enter Adriana and Luciana

 Adri I I Antipholus looke strange and frowne
Some other Mistresse hath thy sweet aspects
I am not Adriana nor thy wife
The time was once when thou vnvrgd wouldst vow
That neuer words were musicke to thine eare
That neuer obiect pleasing in thine eye
That neuer touch well welcome to thy hand
That neuer meat sweetsauourd in thy taste
Vnlesse I spake or lookd or touchd or carud to thee
How comes it now my Husband oh how comes it
That thou art then estranged from thy selfe
Thy selfe I call it being strange to me
That vndiuidable Incorporate
Am better then thy deere selfes better part
Ah doe not teare away thy selfe from me
For know my loue as easie maist thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulfe
And take vnmingled thence that drop againe
Without addition or diminishing
As take from me thy selfe and not me too
How deerely would it touch thee to the quicke
Shouldst thou but heare I were licencious
And that this body consecrate to thee
By Ruffian Lust should be contaminate
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurne at me
And hurle the name of husband in my face
And teare the staind skin of my Harlot brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding ring
And breake it with a deepediuorcing vow
I know thou canst and therefore see thou doe it
I am possest with an adulterate blot
My bloud is mingled with the crime of lust
For if we two be one and thou play false
I doe digest the poison of thy flesh
Being strumpeted by thy contagion
Keepe then faire league and truce with thy true bed
I liue distaind thou vndishonoured

 Antip Plead you to me faire dame I know you not
In Ephesus I am but two houres old
As strange vnto your towne as to your talke
Who euery word by all my wit being scand
Wants wit in all one word to vnderstand

 Luci Fie brother how the world is changd with you
When were you wont to vse my sister thus
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner

 Ant By Dromio

 Adr By thee and this thou didst returne from him
That he did buffet thee and in his blowes
Denied my house for his me for his wife

 Ant Did you conuerse sir with this gentlewoman
What is the course and drift of your compact
 SDro I sir I neuer saw her till this time

 Ant Villaine thou liest for euen her verie words
Didst thou deliuer to me on the Mart

 SDro I neuer spake with her in all my life

 Ant How can she thus then call vs by our names
Vnlesse it be by inspiration

 Adri How ill agrees it with your grauitie
To counterfeit thus grosely with your slaue
Abetting him to thwart me in my moode
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
Come I will fasten on this sleeue of thine
Thou art an Elme my husband I a Vine
Whose weaknesse married to thy stranger state
Makes me with thy strength to communicate
If ought possesse thee from me it is drosse
Vsurping Iuie Brier or idle Mosse
Who all for want of pruning with intrusion
Infect thy sap and liue on thy confusion

 Ant To mee shee speakes shee moues mee for her
theame
What was I married to her in my dreame
Or sleepe I now and thinke I heare all this
What error driues our eies and eares amisse
Vntill I know this sure vncertaintie
Ile entertaine the freed fallacie

 Luc Dromio goe bid the seruants spred for dinner

 SDro Oh for my beads I crosse me for a sinner

 SDro Tis true she rides me and I long for grasse
Tis so I am an Asse else it could neuer be

 Adr Come come no longer will I be a foole
To put the finger in the eie and weepe
Whilst man and Master laughes my woes to scorne
Come sir to dinner Dromio keepe the gate
Husband Ile dine aboue with you to day
And shriue you of a thousand idle prankes
Sirra if any aske you for your Master
Say he dines forth and let no creature enter
Come sister Dromio play the Porter well

 Ant Am I in earth in heauen or in hell
Sleeping or waking mad or well aduisde
Knowne vnto these and to my selfe disguisde

And that to morrow you will bring it home
But heres a villaine that would face me downe
He met me on the Mart and that I beat him
And chargd him with a thousand markes in gold
And that I did denie my wife and house
Thou drunkard thou what didst thou meane by this
 EDro Say what you wil sir but I know what I know
That you beat me at the Mart I haue your hand to show
If y skin were parchment  y blows you gaue were ink
Your owne handwriting would tell you what I thinke

 EAnt I thinke thou art an asse

 EDro Marry so it doth appeare
By the wrongs I suffer and the blowes I beare
I should kicke being kickt and being at that passe
You would keepe from my heeles and beware of an asse

 EAn Yare sad signior Balthazar pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcom here

 Bal I hold your dainties cheap sir  your welcom deer

 EAn Oh signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish

 Bal Good meat sir is common that euery churle affords

 Anti And welcome more common for thats nothing
but words

 Bal Small cheere and great welcome makes a merrie
feast

 Anti I to a niggardly Host and more sparing guest
But though my cates be meane take them in good part

 Anti There is something in the winde that we cannot

 Ant Go fetch me something Ile break ope the gate

 Balth Haue patience sir oh let it not be so
Heerein you warre against your reputation
And draw within the compasse of suspect
Th vnuiolated honor of your wife
Once this your long experience of your wisedome
Her sober vertue yeares and modestie
Plead on your part some cause to you vnknowne
And doubt not sir but she will well excuse
Why at this time the dores are made against you
Be ruld by me depart in patience
And let vs to the Tyger all to dinner
And about euening come your selfe alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint
If by strong hand you offer to breake in
Now in the stirring passage of the day
A vulgar comment will be made of it
And that supposed by the common rowt
Against your yet vngalled estimation
That may with foule intrusion enter in
And dwell vpon your graue when you are dead
For slander liues vpon succession
For euer howsd where it gets possession

 Anti You haue preuaild I will depart in quiet
And in despight of mirth meane to be merrie
I know a wench of excellent discourse
Prettie and wittie wilde and yet too gentle
There will we dine this woman that I meane
My wife but I protest without desert
Hath oftentimes vpbraided me withall
To her will we to dinner get you home
And fetch the chaine by this I know tis made
Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine
For theres the house That chaine will I bestow
Be it for nothing but to spight my wife
Vpon mine hostesse there good sir make haste
Since mine owne doores refuse to entertaine me
Ile knocke elsewhere to see if theyll disdaine me

 Ang Ile meet you at that place some houre hence

 Anti Do so this iest shall cost me some expence

Exeunt

Enter Iuliana with Antipholus of Siracusia

 Iulia And may it be that you haue quite forgot
A husbands office shall Antipholus
Euen in the spring of Loue thy Louesprings rot
Shall loue in buildings grow so ruinate
If you did wed my sister for her wealth
Then for her wealthssake vse her with more kindnesse
Or if you like elsewhere doe it by stealth
Muffle your false loue with some shew of blindnesse
Let not my sister read it in your eye
Be not thy tongue thy owne shames Orator
Looke sweet speake faire become disloyaltie
Apparell vice like vertues harbenger
Beare a faire presence though your heart be tainted
Teach sinne the carriage of a holy Saint
Be secret false what need she be acquainted
What simple thiefe brags of his owne attaine
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy lookes at boord
Shame hath a bastard fame well managed
Ill deeds is doubled with an euill word
Alas poore women make vs not beleeue
Being compact of credit that you loue vs
Though others haue the arme shew vs the sleeue
We in your motion turne and you may moue vs
Then gentle brother get you in againe
Comfort my sister cheere her call her wise
Tis holy sport to be a little vaine
When the sweet breath of flatterie conquers strife

 SAnti Sweete Mistris what your name is else I
know not
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
Lesse in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Then our earths wonder more then earth diuine
Teach me deere creature how to thinke and speake
Lay open to my earthie grosse conceit
Smothred in errors feeble shallow weake
The foulded meaning of your words deceit
Against my soules pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an vnknowne field
Are you a god would you create me new
Transforme me then and to your powre Ile yeeld
But if that I am I then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine
Nor to her bed no homage doe I owe
Farre more farre more to you doe I decline
Oh traine me not sweet Mermaide with thy note
To drowne me in thy sister floud of teares
Sing Siren for thy selfe and I will dote
Spread ore the siluer waues thy golden haires
And as a bud Ile take thee and there lie
And in that glorious supposition thinke
He gaines by death that hath such meanes to die
Let Loue being light be drowned if she sinke

 Luc What are you mad that you doe reason so
 Ant Not mad but mated how I doe not know

 Luc It is a fault that springeth from your eie

 Ant For gazing on your beames faire sun being by

 Luc Gaze when you should and that will cleere
your sight

 Ant As good to winke sweet loue as looke on night

 Luc Why call you me loue Call my sister so

 Ant Thy sisters sister

 Luc Thats my sister

 Ant No it is thy selfe mine owne selfes better part
Mine eies cleere eie my deere hearts deerer heart
My foode my fortune and my sweet hopes aime
My sole earths heauen and my heauens claime

 Luc All this my sister is or else should be

 Ant Call thy selfe sister sweet for I am thee
Thee will I loue and with thee lead my life
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife
Giue me thy hand

 Luc Oh soft sir hold you still

 Anti What is she
 Dro A very reuerent body I such a one as a man
may not speake of without he say sir reuerence I haue
but leane lucke in the match and yet is she a wondrous
fat marriage

 Anti How dost thou meane a fat marriage
 Dro Marry sir shes the Kitchin wench  al grease

Lampe of her and run from her by her owne light I
warrant her ragges and the Tallow in them will burne
a Poland Winter If she liues till doomesday shel burne
a weeke longer then the whole World

 Anti What complexion is she of
 Dro Swart like my shoo but her face nothing like
so cleane kept for why she sweats a man may goe ouershooes
in the grime of it

 Anti Thats a fault that water will mend

 Dro No sir tis in graine Noahs flood could not

Countries in her

 Ant Where Scotland

of the hand

 Ant Where France
 Dro In her forhead armd and reuerted making
warre against her heire

 Ant Where England
 Dro I lookd for the chalkle Cliffes but I could find
no whitenesse in them But I guesse it stood in her chin
by the salt rheume that ranne betweene France and it

 Ant Where Spaine
 Dro Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in her breth

 Ant Where America the Indies
 Dro Oh sir vpon her nose all ore embellished with
Rubies Carbuncles Saphires declining their rich Aspect
to the hot breath of Spaine who sent whole Armadoes
of Carrects to be ballast at her nose

 Anti Where stood Belgia the Netherlands
 Dro Oh sir I did not looke so low To conclude
this drudge or Diuiner layd claime to mee calld mee
Dromio swore I was assurd to her told me what priuie
markes I had about mee as the marke of my shoulder
the Mole in my necke the great Wart on my left arme
that I amazd ranne from her as a witch And I thinke if
my brest had not beene made of faith and my heart of
steele she had transformd me to a Curtull dog  made
me turne ith wheele

 Anti Go hie thee presently post to the rode
And if the winde blow any way from shore
I will not harbour in this Towne to night
If any Barke put forth come to the Mart
Where I will walke till thou returne to me
If euerie one knowes vs and we know none
Tis time I thinke to trudge packe and be gone

 Dro As from a Beare a man would run for life
So flie I from her that would be my wife

Exit

 Anti Theres none but Witches do inhabite heere
And therefore tis hie time that I were hence
She that doth call me husband euen my soule
Doth for a wife abhorre But her faire sister
Possest with such a gentle soueraigne grace
Of such inchanting presence and discourse
Hath almost made me Traitor to my selfe
But least my selfe be guilty to selfe wrong
Ile stop mine eares against the Mermaids song

 Adr Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so
Mightst thou perceiue austeerely in his eie
That he did plead in earnest yea or no
Lookd he or red or pale or sad or merrily
What obseruation madst thou in this case
Oh his hearts Meteors tilting in his face

 Luc First he denide you had in him no right

 Adr He meant he did me none the more my spight
 Luc Then swore he that he was a stranger heere

 Adr And true he swore though yet forsworne hee
were

 Luc Then pleaded I for you

 Adr And what said he
 Luc That loue I beggd for you he beggd of me

 Adr With what perswasion did he tempt thy loue
 Luc With words that in an honest suit might moue
First he did praise my beautie then my speech

 Adr Didst speake him faire
 Luc Haue patience I beseech

 Adr I cannot nor I will not hold me still
My tongue though not my heart shall haue his will
He is deformed crooked old and sere
Illfacd worse bodied shapelesse euery where
Vicious vngentle foolish blunt vnkinde
Stigmaticall in making worse in minde

 Luc Who would be iealous then of such a one
No euill lost is waild when it is gone

On whose hard heart is buttond vp with steele
A Feind a Fairie pittilesse and ruffe
A Wolfe nay worse a fellow all in buffe
A back friend a shoulderclapper one that countermands
The passages of allies creekes and narrow lands
A hound that runs Counter and yet draws drifoot well
One that before the Iudgment carries poore soules to hel

 Adr Why man what is the matter
 SDro I doe not know the matter hee is rested on
the case

 Adr What is he arrested tell me at whose suite

 Adri As if time were in debt how fondly dost thou

 SDro Time is a verie bankerout and owes more then

If I be in debt and theft and a Serieant in the way
Hath he not reason to turne backe an houre in a day

 Cur Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad
Else would he neuer so demeane himselfe
A Ring he hath of mine worth fortie Duckets
And for the same he promisd me a Chaine
Both one and other he denies me now
The reason that I gather he is mad
Besides this present instance of his rage
Is a mad tale he told to day at dinner
Of his owne doores being shut against his entrance
Belike his wife acquainted with his fits
On purpose shut the doores against his way
My way is now to hie home to his house
And tell his wife that being Lunaticke
He rushd into my house and tooke perforce
My Ring away This course I fittest choose
For fortie Duckets is too much to loose

And not without some scandall to your selfe
With circumstance and oaths so to denie
This Chaine which now you weare so openly
Beside the charge the shame imprisonment
You haue done wrong to this my honest friend
Who but for staying on our Controuersie
Had hoisted saile and put to sea to day
This Chaine you had of me can you deny it
 Ant I thinke I had I neuer did deny it

 Mar I am sorry now that I did draw on him

 Ab How long hath this possession held the man

 Adr This weeke he hath beene heauie sower sad
And much different from the man he was
But till this afternoone his passion
Nere brake into extremity of rage

 Ab Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea
Buried some deere friend hath not else his eye
Strayd his affection in vnlawfull loue
A sinne preuailing much in youthfull men
Who giue their eies the liberty of gazing
Which of these sorrowes is he subiect too
 Adr To none of these except it be the last
Namely some loue that drew him oft from home

 Ab You should for that haue reprehended him

 Adr Why so I did

 Ab I but not rough enough

 Adr As roughly as my modestie would let me

 Ab Haply in priuate

 Adr And in assemblies too

 Ab I but not enough

 Adr It was the copie of our Conference
In bed he slept not for my vrging it
At boord he fed not for my vrging it
Alone it was the subiect of my Theame
In company I often glanced it
Still did I tell him it was vilde and bad

 Ab And thereof came it that the man was mad
The venome clamors of a iealous woman
Poisons more deadly then a mad dogges tooth
It seemes his sleepes were hindred by thy railing
And thereof comes it that his head is light
Thou saist his meate was sawcd with thy vpbraidings
Vnquiet meales make ill digestions
Thereof the raging fire of feauer bred
And whats a Feauer but a fit of madnesse
Thou sayest his sports were hindred by thy bralles
Sweet recreation barrd what doth ensue
But moodie and dull melancholly
Kinsman to grim and comfortlesse dispaire
And at her heeles a huge infectious troope
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life
In food in sport and lifepreseruing rest
To be disturbd would mad or man or beast
The consequence is then thy iealous fits
Hath scard thy husband from the vse of wits

 Luc She neuer reprehended him but mildely
When he demeand himselfe rough rude and wildly
Why beare you these rebukes and answer not
 Adri She did betray me to my owne reproofe
Good people enter and lay hold on him

 Ab No not a creature enters in my house

 Ad Then let your seruants bring my husband forth
 Ab Neither he tooke this place for sanctuary
And it shall priuiledge him from your hands
Till I haue brought him to his wits againe
Or loose my labour in assaying it

 Adr I will attend my husband be his nurse
Diet his sicknesse for it is my Office
And will haue no atturney but my selfe
And therefore let me haue him home with me

 Ab Be patient for I will not let him stirre
Till I haue vsd the approoued meanes I haue
With wholsome sirrups drugges and holy prayers
To make of him a formall man againe
It is a branch and parcell of mine oath
A charitable dutie of my order
Therefore depart and leaue him heere with me

 Adr I will not hence and leaue my husband heere
And ill it doth beseeme your holinesse
To separate the husband and the wife

 Ab Be quiet and depart thou shalt not haue him

 Duke She is a vertuous and a reuerend Lady
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong

 Adr May it please your Grace Antipholus my husband
Who I made Lord of me and all I had
At your important Letters this ill day
A most outragious fit of madnesse tooke him
That desprately he hurried through the streete
With him his bondman all as mad as he
Doing displeasure to the Citizens
By rushing in their houses bearing thence
Rings Iewels any thing his rage did like
Once did I get him bound and sent him home
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
That heere and there his furie had committed
Anon I wot not by what strong escape
He broke from those that had the guard of him
And with his mad attendant and himselfe
Each one with irefull passion with drawne swords
Met vs againe and madly bent on vs
Chacd vs away till raising of more aide
We came againe to binde them then they fled
Into this Abbey whether we pursud them
And heere the Abbesse shuts the gates on vs
And will not suffer vs to fetch him out
Nor send him forth that we may beare him hence
Therefore most gracious Duke with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for helpe

 Duke Long since thy husband serud me in my wars
And I to thee ingagd a Princes word

To do him all the grace and good I could

Oh Mistris Mistris shift and saue your selfe

Beaten the Maids arow and bound the Doctor
Whose beard they haue sindgd off with brands of fire
And euer as it blazd they threw on him
Great pailes of puddled myre to quench the haire
My Mr preaches patience to him and the while
His man with Cizers nickes him like a foole
And sure vnlesse you send some present helpe
Betweene them they will kill the Coniurer

 Adr Peace foole thy Master and his man are here
And that is false thou dost report to vs

While she with Harlots feasted in my house

 Duke A greeuous fault say woman didst thou so

To day did dine together so befall my soule
As this is false he burthens me withall

 Luc Nere may I looke on day nor sleepe on night
But she tels to your Highnesse simple truth

 Gold O periurd woman They are both forsworne
In this the Madman iustly chargeth them

 EAnt My Liege I am aduised what I say
Neither disturbed with the effect of Wine
Nor headierash prouoakd with raging ire
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
This woman lockd me out this day from dinner
That Goldsmith there were he not packd with her
Could witnesse it for he was with me then
Who parted with me to go fetch a Chaine
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine
Where Balthasar and I did dine together
Our dinner done and he not comming thither
I went to seeke him In the street I met him
And in his companie that Gentleman
There did this periurd Goldsmith sweare me downe
That I this day of him receiud the Chaine
Which God he knowes I saw not For the which
He did arrest me with an Officer
I did obey and sent my Pesant home
For certaine Duckets he with none returnd
Then fairely I bespoke the Officer
To go in person with me to my house
Byth way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more
Of vilde Confederates Along with them
They brought one Pinch a hungry leanefacd Villaine
A meere Anatomie a Mountebanke
A thredbare Iugler and a Fortuneteller

Forsooth tooke on him as a Coniurer
And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
And with noface as twere outfacing me
Cries out I was possest Then altogether
They fell vpon me bound me bore me thence
And in a darke and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man both bound together
Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
I gaind my freedome and immediately
Ran hether to your Grace whom I beseech
To giue me ample satisfaction
For these deepe shames and great indignities

 Gold My Lord in truth thus far I witnes with him
That he dind not at home but was lockd out

 Duke But had he such a Chaine of thee or no
 Gold He had my Lord and when he ran in heere
These people saw the Chaine about his necke

 Mar Besides I will be sworne these eares of mine
Heard you confesse you had the Chaine of him
After you first forswore it on the Mart
And thereupon I drew my sword on you
And then you fled into this Abbey heere
From whence I thinke you are come by Miracle

 EAnt I neuer came within these Abbey wals
Nor euer didst thou draw thy sword on me
I neuer saw the Chaine so helpe me heauen
And this is false you burthen me withall

 Duke Why what an intricate impeach is this
I thinke you all haue drunke of Circes cup
If heere you housd him heere he would haue bin
If he were mad he would not pleade so coldly
You say he dind at home the Goldsmith heere
Denies that saying Sirra what say you

 Cur He did and from my finger snacht that Ring

 EAnti Tis true my Liege this Ring I had of her

Exit one to the Abbesse

 Fa Most mighty Duke vouchsafe me speak a word
Haply I see a friend will saue my life
And pay the sum that may deliuer me

 Duke Speake freely Siracusian what thou wilt

But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
 Ant Neither

 Dro No trust me sir nor I

 Fa I am sure thou dost
 EDromio I sir but I am sure I do not and whatsoeuer
a man denies you are now bound to beleeue him

 Fath Not know my voice oh times extremity
Hast thou so crackd and splitted my poore tongue
In seuen short yeares that heere my onely sonne
Knowes not my feeble key of vntund cares
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sapconsuming Winters drizled snow
And all the Conduits of my blood froze vp
Yet hath my night of life some memorie
My wasting lampes some fading glimmer left
My dull deafe eares a little vse to heare
All these old witnesses I cannot erre
Tell me thou art my sonne Antipholus

 Ant I neuer saw my Father in my life

 Fa But seuen yeares since in Siracusa boy
Thou knowst we parted but perhaps my sonne
Thou shamst to acknowledge me in miserie

 Ant The Duke and all that know me in the City
Can witnesse with me that it is not so
I nere saw Siracusa in my life

 Duke I tell thee Siracusian twentie yeares
Haue I bin Patron to Antipholus
During which time he nere saw Siracusa
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote

Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus Siracusa and Dromio Sir

 Abbesse Most mightie Duke behold a man much
wrongd

All gather to see them

 Adr I see two husbands or mine eyes deceiue me

 Duke One of these men is genius to the other
And so of these which is the naturall man
And which the spirit Who deciphers them
 SDromio I Sir am Dromio command him away

 EDro I Sir am Dromio pray let me stay

 SAnt Egeon art thou not or else his ghost

 SDrom Oh my olde Master who hath bound him
heere
 Abb Who euer bound him I will lose his bonds
And gaine a husband by his libertie
Speake olde Egeon if thou beest the man
That hadst a wife once calld Aemilia
That bore thee at a burthen two faire sonnes
Oh if thou beest the same Egeon speake
And speake vnto the same Aemilia

 Duke Why heere begins his Morning storie right
These two Antipholus these two so like
And these two Dromios one in semblance
Besides her vrging of her wracke at sea
These are the parents to these children
Which accidentally are met together

 Fa If I dreame not thou art Aemilia
If thou art she tell me where is that sonne
That floated with thee on the fatall rafte

 Abb By men of Epidamium he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken vp
But by and by rude Fishermen of Corinth
By force tooke Dromio and my sonne from them
And me they left with those of Epidamium
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see mee in

 Duke Antipholus thou camst from Corinth first

 SAnt No sir not I I came from Siracuse

 Duke Stay stand apart I know not which is which

 EAnt I came from Corinth my most gracious Lord
 EDro And I with him

 EAnt Brought to this Town by that most famous
Warriour
Duke Menaphon your most renowned Vnckle

 Adr Which of you two did dine with me to day
 SAnt I gentle Mistris

 Adr And are not you my husband
 EAnt No I say nay to that

 SAnt And so do I yet did she call me so
And this faire Gentlewoman her sister heere
Did call me brother What I told you then
I hope I shall haue leisure to make good
If this be not a dreame I see and heare

 Goldsmith That is the Chaine sir which you had of
mee

 SAnt I thinke it be sir I denie it not

 EAnt And you sir for this Chaine arrested me

 Gold I thinke I did sir I deny it not

 Adr I sent you monie sir to be your baile
By Dromio but I thinke he brought it not

 EDro No none by me

 SAnt This purse of Duckets I receiud from you
And Dromio my man did bring them me
I see we still did meete each others man
And I was tane for him and he for me
And thereupon these errors are arose

 EAnt These Duckets pawne I for my father heere

 Duke It shall not neede thy father hath his life

 Cur Sir I must haue that Diamond from you

 EAnt There take it and much thanks for my good
cheere

 Abb Renowned Duke vouchsafe to take the paines
To go with vs into the Abbey heere
And heare at large discoursed all our fortunes
And all that are assembled in this place
That by this simpathized one daies error
Haue sufferd wrong Goe keepe vs companie
And we shall make full satisfaction
Thirtie three yeares haue I but gone in trauaile
Of you my sonnes and till this present houre
My heauie burthen are deliuered
The Duke my husband and my children both
And you the Kalenders of their Natiuity
Go to a Gossips feast and go with mee
After so long greefe such Natiuitie

 Duke With all my heart Ile Gossip at this feast

Exeunt omnes Manet the two Dromios and two Brothers

 SDro Master shall I fetch your stuffe from shipbord
 EAn Dromio what stuffe of mine hast thou imbarkt
 SDro Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur

 SAnt He speakes to me I am your master Dromio
Come go with vs weel looke to that anon
Embrace thy brother there reioyce with him

Exit

 SDro There is a fat friend at your masters house
That kitchind me for you to day at dinner
She now shall be my sister not my wife
 ED Me thinks you are my glasse  not my brother
I see by you I am a sweetfacd youth
Will you walke in to see their gossipping
 SDro Not I sir you are my elder

 EDro Thats a question how shall we trie it

 SDro Weel draw Cuts for the Signior till then
lead thou first

 EDro Nay then thus
We came into the world like brother and brother
And now lets go hand in hand not one before another

Exeunt
