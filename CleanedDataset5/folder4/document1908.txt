HER PRAIRIE KNIGHT



CHAPTER 1 Stranded on the Prairie


By George look behind us I fancy we are going to have a storm Four
heads turned as if governed by one brain four pairs of eyes of varied
color and character swept the windblown wilderness of tender green
and gazed questioningly at the highpiled thunderheads above A
small boy with an abundance of yellow curls and white collar almost
precipitated himself into the prim lap of a lady on the rear seat

Auntie will God have fireworks Say auntie will He Can I say
prayers widout kneelin down Uncle Redmon crowds so I want to pray
for fireworks auntie Can I

Do sit down Dorman Youll fall under the wheel and then auntie would
not have any dear little boy Dorman do you hear me Redmond do
take that child down How I wish Parks were here I shall have nervous
prostration within a fortnight

Sir Redmond Hayes plucked at the white collar and the small boy retired
between two masculine forms of no mean proportions His voice however
rose higher

Youll get all the fireworks you want young man without all that
hullabaloo remarked the driver whom Dorman had been told at the
depot twenty miles back he must call his Uncle Richard

I love storms came cheerfully from the rear seatbut the voice was
not the prim voice of auntie Do you have thunder and lightning out
here Dick

We do assented Dick We dont ship it from the East in refrigerator
cars either It grows wild

The cheerful voice was heard to giggle

Richard came in tired reproachful accents from a third voice behind
him you were reared in the East I trust you have not formed the
pernicious habit of speaking slightingly of your birthplace

That Dick knew was his mother She had not changed appreciably since
she had nagged him through his teens Not having seen her since he was
certainly in a position to judge

Trix asked about the lightning he said placatingly just as he was
accustomed to do during the nagging period I was telling her

Beatrice has a naturally inquiring mind said the tired voice laying
reproving stress upon the name

Are you afraid of lightning Sir Redmond asked the cheerful
girlvoice

Sir Redmond twisted his neck to smile back at her No so long as it
doesnt actually chuck me over

After that there was silence so far as human voices went for a time

How much farther is it Dick came presently from the girl

Not more than tenwell maybe twelvemiles Youll think its twenty
though if the rain strikes Dobe Flat before we do Thats just what
its going to do or Im badly mistaken Hawk Get along there

We havent an umbrella with us complained the tired one Beatrice
where did you put my raglan

In the big wagon mama along with the trunks and guns and saddles and
Martha and Katherine and James

Dear me I certainly told you Beatrice

But mama you gave it to me the last thing after the maids were in
the wagon and said you wouldnt wear it There isnt room here for
another thing I feel like a slice of pressed chicken

Auntie I want some pessed chicken Im hungry auntie I want some
chicken and a cookieand I want some icecream

You wont get any said the young woman with the tone of finality
You cant eat me Dorman and Im the only thing that looks good enough
to eat

Beatrice This of course from her mother whose life seemed
principally made up of a succession of mental shocks brought on by her
youngest dearest and most irrepressible

I have Dicks word for it mama he said so at the depot

I want some chicken auntie

There is no chicken dear said the prim one You must be a patient
little man

I wont Im hungry Mens arent patient when deyre hungry A small
red face rose like a tiny harvest moon between the broad masculine
backs on the front seat

Dorman sit down Redmond

A large gloved hand appeared against the small moon and it set
ignominiously and prematurely in the place where it had risen Sir
Redmond further extinguished it with the lap robe for the storm
whooping malicious joy was upon them

First a blinding glare and a deafening crash Then rainsheets of it
that drenched where it struck The women huddled together under the
doubtful protection of the light robe and shivered After that wind
that threatened to overturn the light spring wagon then hail that
bounced and hopped like tiny white rubber balls upon the ground

The storm passed as suddenly as it came but the effect remained The
road was sodden with the water which had fallen and as they went down
the hill to Dobe Flat the horses strained at the collar and plodded
like a plow team The wheels collected masses of adobe which stuck like
glue and packed the spaces between the spokes Twice Dick got out and
poked the heavy mess from the wheels with Sir Redmonds stickwhich
was not good for the stick but which eased the drag upon the horses
wonderfullyuntil the wheels accumulated another load

Sorry to dirty your cane Dick apologized after the second halt You
can rinse it off though in the creek a few miles ahead

Dont mention it said Sir Redmond somewhat dubiously It was his
favorite stick and he had taken excellent care of it It was finely
polished and it had his name and regiment engraved upon the silver
knoband a date which the Boers will not soon forget nor the English
for that matter

Well soon be over the worst Dick told them after a time When we
climb that hill well have a hard gravelly trail straight to the ranch
Im sorry it had to storm I wanted you to enjoy this trip

I am enjoying it Beatrice assured him Its something new at any
rate and anything is better than the deadly monotony of Newport

Beatrice cried her mother Im ashamed of you

You neednt be mama Why wont you just be sorry for yourself and
let it end there I know you hated to come poor dear but you wouldnt
think of letting me come alone though Im sure I shouldnt have minded
This is going to be a delicious summerI feel it in my bones

Beatrice

Why mama Arent young ladies supposed to have bones

Young ladies are not supposed to make use of unrefined expressions
Your poor sister

There mama Dear Dolly didnt live upon stilts Im sure Even when
she married

Beatrice

Dear me mama I hope you are not growing peevish Peevish elderly
people

Auntie I want to go home the small boy wailed

You cannot go home now dear sighed his guardian angel Look at the
pretty She hesitated groping vaguely for some object to which she
might conscientiously apply the adjective

Mud suggested Beatrice promptly Look at the wheels Dorman theyre
playing pattycake See now they say Roll em and roll em and
now Toss in the oven to bake And now

Auntie I want to get out an play pattycake like de wheels I want
to awflly

Beatrice why did you put that into his head her mother demanded
fretfully

Never mind honey called Beatrice cheeringly You and I will make
hundreds of mud pies when we get to Uncle Dicks ranch Just think hon
oodles of beautiful yellow mud just beside the door

Look here Trix Seems to me youre promising a whole lot you cant
make good I dont live in a dobe patch

Hush Dick dont spoil everything You dont know Dorman

Beatrice What must Miss Hayes and Sir Redmond think of you Im sure
Dorman is a sweet child the image of poor dear Dorothea at his age

We all think Dorman bears a strong resemblance to his father said his
Aunt Mary

Beatrice scenting trouble hurried to change the subject Whats this
Dickthe Missouri River

Hardly This is the water that didnt fall in the buggy It isnt deep
it makes bad going worse thats all

Thinking to expedite matters he struck Hawk sharply across the flank
It was a foolish thing to do and Dick knew it when he did it ten
seconds later he knew it better

Hawk reared tired as he was and lunged viciously

The doubletrees snapped and splintered there was a brief interval
of plunging a shower of muddy water in that vicinity and then two
draggled disgusted brown horses splashed indignantly to shore and took
to the hills with straps flying

By George ejaculated Sir Redmond gazing helplessly after them But
this is a beastly bit of luck dont you know

Oh you Hawk Dick in consideration of his companions finished the
remark in the recesses of his troubled soul where the ladies could not
overhear

What comes next Dick The voice of Beatrice was frankly curious

Next Ill have to wade out and take after those This sentence
also was rounded out mentally

In the meantime what shall we do

Youll stay where you areand thank the good Lord you were not
upset Im sorryturning so that he could look deprecatingly at Miss
Hayesyour welcome to the West has been soerstrenuous Ill try
and make it up to you once you get to the ranch I hope you wont let
this give you a dislike of the country

Oh no said the spinster politely Im sure it is aa very nice
country Mr Lansell

Well theres nothing to be done sitting here Dick climbed down over
the dashboard into the mud and water

Sir Redmond was not the man to shirk duty because it happened to be
disagreeable as the regiment whose name was engraved upon his cane
could testify He glanced regretfully at his immaculate leggings and
followed

I fancy you ladies wont need any bodyguard he said Looking back he
caught the light of approval shining in the eyes of Beatrice and after
that he did not mind the mud but waded to shore and joined in the
chase quite contentedly The light of approval shining in the eyes of
Beatrice meant much to Sir Redmond



CHAPTER 2 A Handsome Cowboy to the Rescue


Beatrice took immediate possession of the front seat that she might
comfort her heartbroken young nephew

Never mind honey Theyll bring the horses back in a minute and well
make them run every step And when you get to Uncle Dicks ranch youll
see the nicest thingsbossy calves and chickens and maybe some
little pigs with curly tails

All this though alluring failed of its purpose the small boy
continued to weep and his weeping was earsplitting

Be still Dorman or youll certainly scare all the coyotes to death

Where are dey

Oh all around You keep watch hon and maybe youll see one put the
tip of his nose over a hill

What hill Dorman skipped a sob and scoured his eyes industriously
with both fists

Mmthat hill That little one over there Watch close or youll miss
him

The dove of peace hovered over them and seemed actually about to
alight Beatrice leaned back with a relieved breath

It is good of you my dear to take so much trouble sighed his Aunt
Mary How I am to manage without Parks Im sure I cannot tell

You are tired and you miss your tea soothed Beatrice optimistic as
to tone When we all have a good rest we will be all right Dorman will
find plenty to amuse him We are none of us exactly comfortable now

Comfortable sniffed her mother I am half dead Richard wrote such
glowing letters home that I was misled If I had dreamed of the true
conditions Miss Hayes I should never have sanctioned this wild idea of
Beatrices to come out and spend the summer with Richard

Its coming Betrice There it is Will it bite auntie Say will it
bite

Beatrice looked A horseman came over the hill and was galloping down
the long slope toward them His elbows were lifted contrary to the
mandates of the ridingschool his long legs were encased in something
brown and fringed down the sides His gray hat was tilted rakishly up
at the back and down in front and a handkerchief was knotted loosely
around his throat Even at that distance he struck her as different from
any one she had ever seen

Its a highwayman whispered Mrs Lansell Hide your purse my dear

IIwhere Miss Hayes was all aflutter with fear

Drop it down beside the wheel into the water Quick I shall drop my
watch

Hehe is coming on this side He can see Her whisper was full of
entreaty and despair

Give them here He cant see on both sides of the buggy at once Mrs
Lansell being an Americana Yankee at thatwas a woman of resource

Beatrice hand me your watch quick

Beatrice paid no attention and there was no time to insist upon
obedience The horseman had slowed at the waters edge and was
regarding them with some curiosity Possibly he was not accustomed to
such a sight as the one that met his eyes He came splashing toward
them however as though he intended to investigate the cause of their
presence alone upon the prairie in a vehicle which had no horses
attached in the place obviously intended for such attachment When he
was close upon them he stopped and lifted the rakishly tilted gray hat

You seem to be in trouble Is there anything I can do for you His
manner was grave and respectful but his eyes Beatrice observed were
having a quiet laugh of their own

You cant get aunties watch nor granmamas Granmama frowed em all
down in the mud She frowed her money down in the mud too announced
Dorman with much complacency Betrice says you is a coyote Is you

There was a stunned interval during which nothing was heard but the
wind whispering things to the grass The mans eyes stopped laughing
his jaw set squarely also his brows drew perceptibly closer together
It was Mrs Lansells opinion that he looked murderous

Then Beatrice put her head down upon the little blue velvet cap of
Dorman and laughed There was a rollicking note in her laughter that was
irresistible and the eyes of the man relented and joined in her mirth
His lips forgot they were angry and insulted and uncovered some very
nice teeth

We arent really crazy Beatrice told him sitting up straight and
drying her eyes daintily with her handkerchief We were on our way to
Mr Lansells ranch and the horses broke something and ran away and
DickMr Lansellhas gone to catch them Were waiting until he does

I see From the look in his eyes one might guess that what he saw
pleased him Which direction did they take

Beatrice waved a gloved hand vaguely to the left and without another
word the fellow touched his hat turned and waded to shore and galloped
over the ridge she indicated and the clucketycluck of his horses hoofs
came sharply across to them until he dipped out of sight

You see he wasnt a robber Beatrice remarked staring after him
speculatively How well he rides One can see at a glance that he
almost lives in the saddle I wonder who he is

For all you know Beatrice he may be going now to murder Richard and
Sir Redmond in cold blood He looks perfectly hardened

Oh do you think it possible cried Miss Hayes much alarmed

No cried Beatrice hotly One who did not know your horror of
novels mama might suspect you of feeding your imagination upon penny
dreadfuls Im sure he is only a cowboy and wont harm anybody

Cowboys are as bad as highwaymen contended her mother or worse I
have read how they shoot men for a pastime and without even the excuse
of robbery

Is it possible quavered Miss Hayes faintly

No it isnt Beatrice assured her indignantly

He has the look of a criminal declared Mrs Lansell in the positive
tone of one who speaks from intimate knowledge of the subject under
discussion I only hope he isnt going to murder

Theyre coming back mama interrupted Beatrice who had been watching
closely the hilltop No its that man and he is driving the horses

Hes chasing them corrected her mother testily A horse thief no
doubt Hes going to catch them with his snare

Lasso mama

Well lasso Where can Richard be To think the fellow should be
so bold But out here with miles upon miles of open and no police
protection anything is possible We might all be murdered and no one
be the wiser for daysperhaps weeks There he has caught them She
leaned back and clasped her hands ready to meet with fortitude whatever
fate might have in store

Hes bringing them out to us mama Cant you see the man is only
trying to help us

Mrs Lansell beginning herself to suspect him of honest intentions
sniffed dissentingly and let it go at that The fellow was certainly
leading the horses toward them and Sir Redmond and Dick appearing over
the hill just then proved beyond doubt that neither had been murdered
in cold blood or in any other unpleasant manner

Were all right now mother Dick called the minute he was near
enough

His mother remarked skeptically that she hoped possibly she had been in
too great haste to conceal her valuablesthat Miss Hayes might not feel
grateful for her presence of mind and was probably wondering if mud
baths were not injurious to fine jeweled timepieces Mrs Lansell
was uncomfortable mentally and physically and her manner was frankly
chilly when her son presented the stranger as his good friend and
neighbor Keith Cameron She was still privately convinced that he
looked a criminalthough if pressed she must surely have admitted
that he was an uncommonly goodlooking young outlaw It would seem
almost as if she regarded his being a decent lawabiding citizen as
pure effrontery

Miss Hayes greeted him with a smile of apprehension which plainly amused
him Beatrice was frankly impersonal in her attitude he represented a
new species of the genus man and she too evidently regarded him in
the light of a strange animal viewed unexpectedly at close range

While he was helping Dick mend the doubletree with a piece of rope she
studied him curiously He was talltaller even than Sir Redmond and
more slender Sir Redmond had the straight sturdy look of the soldier
who had borne the brunt of hard marches and desperate fighting Mr
Cameron the lithe unconscious grace and alertness of the man whose
work demands quick movement and quicker eye and brain His face was
tanned to a clear bronze which showed the blood darkly beneath Sir
Redmonds year of peace had gone far toward lightening his complexion
Beatrice glanced briefly at him and admired his healthy color and was
glad he did not have the look of an Indian At the same time she caught
herself wishing that Sir Redmonds eyes were hazel fringed with very
long dark lashes and topped with very straight dark browseyes which
seemed always to have some secret cause for mirth and to laugh quite
independent of the rest of the face Still Sir Redmond had very nice
eyesblue and kind and steadfast and altogether dependableand his
lashes were quite nice enough for any one In just four seconds Beatrice
decided that after all she did not like hazel eyes that twinkle
continually they make one feel that one is being laughed at which is
not comfortable In six seconds she was quite sure that this Mr Cameron
thought himself handsome and Beatrice detested a man who was proud of
his face or his figure such a man always tempted her to make faces
as she used to do over the back fence when she was little

She mentally accused him of trying to show off his skill with his rope
when he leaned and fastened it to the rig rode out ahead and helped
drag the vehicle to shore and it was with some resentment that she
observed the ease with which he did it and how horse and rope seemed to
know instinctively their masters will and to obey of their own accord

In all that he had doneand it really seemed as if he did everything
that needed to be done while Dick pottered around in the wayhe had
not found it necessary to descend into the mud and water to the ruin of
his picturesque fringed chaps and highheeled boots He had worked at
ease carelessly leaning from his leathern throne upon the big roan
horse he addressed occasionally as Redcloud Beatrice wondered where he
got the outlandish name But with all his imperfections she was glad
she had met him He really was handsome whether he knew it or not and
if he had a good opinion of himself and overrated his actionsall the
more fun for herself Beatrice I regret to say was not above amusing
herself with handsome young men who overrate their own charms in fact
she had the reputation among her women acquaintances of being a most
outrageous flirt

In the very middle of these troublebreeding meditations Mr Cameron
looked up unexpectedly and met keenly her eyes and for some reasonlet
us hope because of a guilty conscienceBeatrice grew hot and confused
an unusual experience surely for a girl who had been out three
seasons and has met calmly the eyes of many young men Until now it had
been the young men who grew hot and confused it had never been herself

Beatrice turned her shoulder toward him and looked at Sir Redmond who
was surreptitiously fishing for certain articles beside the rear wheel
at the whispered behest of Mrs Lansell and was certainly a sight to
behold He was mud to his knees and to his elbows and he had managed to
plaster his hat against the wheel and to dirty his face Altogether he
looked an abnormally large child who has been having a beautiful day of
it in somebodys duckpond but Beatrice was nearer at that moment
to loving him than she had been at any time during her six weeks
acquaintance with himand that is saying much for she had liked him
from the start

Mr Cameron followed her glance and his eyes did not have the laugh all
to themselves his voice joined them and Beatrice turned upon him and
frowned It was not kind of him to laugh at a man who is proving his
heart to be much larger than his vanity Beatrice was aware of Sir
Redmonds immaculateness of attire on most occasions

Well said Dick gathering up the reins youve helped us out of a
bad scrape Keith Come over and take dinner with us tomorrow night
I expect well be kept riding the rimrocks over at the Pool this
summer Unless this sister of mine has changed a lot she wont rest
till shes been over every foot of country for forty miles around It
will just about keep our strings rode down to a whisper keeping her in
sight

Dear me Richard said his mother What Jargon is this you speak

Thats good old Montana English mother Youll learn it yourself
before you leave here Ive clean forgot how they used the English
language at Yale havent you Keith

Just about Keith agreed Im afraid well shock the ladies terribly
Dick We ought to get out on a pinnacle with a good grammar and
practice

Well maybe Well look for you tomorrow sure I want you to help map
out a circle or two for Trix About next week shell want to get out and
scour the range

Dear me Richard Beatrice is not a charwoman This you will
understand was from his mother perhaps you will also understand that
she spoke with the rising inflection which conveys a reproof

When Keith Cameron left them he was laughing quietly to himself and
Beatrices chin was set rather more than usual



CHAPTER 3 A Tilt With Sir Redmond


Beatrice standing on the top of a steep grassy slope was engaged in
the conventional pastime of enjoying the view It was a fine view but
it was not half as good to look upon as was Beatrice herself in her
fresh white waist and brown skirt with her brown hair fluffing softly
in the breeze which would grow to a respectable wind later in the day
and with her cheeks pink from climbing

She was up where she could see the river a broad band of blue in the
surrounding green winding away for miles through the hills The far
bank stood a straight two hundred feet of gaycolored rock chiseled by
time and stress of changeful weather into fanciful turrets and towers
Above and beyond where the green began hundreds of moving dots told
where the cattle were feeding quietly Far away to the south heaps of
hazy blue and purple slept in the sunshine Dick had told her those
were the Highwoods And away to the west a jagged line of bluewhite
glimmered and stood upon tiptoes to touch the swimming cloudstouched
them and pushed above proudly those were the Rockies The Bear Paws
stood behind her nearer they wereso near they lost the glamour of
mysterious blue shadows and became merely a sprawling group of huge
pinecovered hills with ranches dotted here and there in sheltered
places with squares of fresh dark green that spoke of growing crops

Ten days and the metropolitan East had faded and become as hazy and
vague as the Highwoods Ten days and the witchery of the West leaped in
her blood and held her fast in its thralldom

A sound of scrambling behind her was immediately followed by a smothered
epithet Beatrice turned in time to see Sir Redmond pick himself up

These grass slopes are confounded slippery dont you know he
explained apologetically How did you manage that climb

I didnt Beatrice smiled I came around the end where the ascent is
gradual theres a good path

Oh Sir Redmond sat down upon a rock and puffed I saw you up
hereand a fellow doesnt think about taking a roundabout course to
reach his hearts

Isnt it lovely Beatrice made haste to inquire

Lovely isnt half expressive enough he told her You look

The river is so very blue and dignified Ive been wondering if it has
forgotten how it must have danced through those hills away off there
When it gets down to the citiesthis blue waterit will be muddy and
nasty looking The muddy Missouri certainly doesnt apply here And
that farther shore is simply magnificent I wish I might stay here
forever

The Lord forbid cried he with considerable fervor Theres a dear
nook in old England where I hope

You did get that mud off your leggings I see Beatrice remarked
inconsequentially James must have worked half the time weve been
here They certainly were in a mess the last time I saw them

Bother the leggings But I take it thats a good sign Miss
Lansellyour taking notice of such things

Beatrice returned to the landscape I wonder who originated that
phrase The cattle grazing on a thousand hills He must have stood
just here when he said it

Wasnt it one of your American poets Longfellow orer

Beatrice simply looked at him a minute and said Pshaw

Well he retorted you dont know yourself who it was

And to think Beatrice went on ignoring the subject some of those
grazing cows and bossy calves are minemy very own I never cared
before or thought much about it till I came out and saw where they
live and Dick pointed to a cow and the sweetest little red and white
calf and said Thats your cow and calf Trix They were dreadfully
afraid of me thoughIm afraid they didnt recognize me as their
mistress I wanted to get down and pet the calfit had the dearest
little snub nose but they bolted and wouldnt let me near them

I fancy they were not accustomed to meeting angels unawares

Sir Redmond I wish you wouldnt You are so much nicer when youre not
trying to be nice

Ill act a perfect brute he offered eagerly if that will make you
love me

Its hardly worth trying I think you would make a very poor sort of
villain Sir Redmond You wouldnt even be picturesque

Sir Redmond looked rather floored He was a good fighter was Sir
Redmond but he was clumsy at reparteeor perhaps he was too much in
earnest to fence gracefully Just now he looked particularly foolish

Dont you think my brand is pretty You know what it is dont you

Im afraid not he owned I fancy I need a good bit of coaching in
the matter of brands

Yes agreed Beatrice I fancy you do My brand is a Triangle
Barlike this With a sharp pointed bit of rock she drew a more or
less exact diagram in the yellow soil There are ever so many different
brands belonging to the Northern Pool Dick pointed them out to me but
I cant remember them But whenever you see a Triangle Bar youll be
looking at my individual property I think it was nice of Dick to give
me a brand all my own Mr Cameron has a pretty brand tooa Maltese
Cross The Maltese Cross was owned at one time by President Roosevelt
Mr Cameron bought it when he left college and went into the cattle
business He plays a lone hand as he calls it but his cattle range
with the Northern Pool and he and Dick work together a great deal I
think he has lovely eyes dont you The eyes of Beatrice were intent
upon the Bear Paws when she said itwhich brought her shoulder toward
Sir Redmond and hid her face from him

I cant say I ever observed Mr Camerons eyes said Sir Redmond
stiffly

Beatrice turned back to him and smiled demurely When Beatrice smiled
that very demure smile of which she was capable the weatherwise
generally edged toward their cyclonecellars Sir Redmond was not
weatherwisehe was too much in love with herand he did not possess a
cyclone cellar he therefore suffered much at the hands of Beatrice

But surely you must have noticed that deep deep dimple in his chin
she questioned innocently Keith Cameron I may say did not have a
dimple in his chin at all there was however a deep crease in it

I did not Sir Redmond rubbed his own chin which was so far from
dimpling that is was rounded like half an apricot

Dear me And you sat opposite to him at dinner yesterday too I
suppose then you did not observe that his teeth are the whitest
evenest

They make them cheaply over here Im told he retorted setting his
heel emphatically down and annihilating a red and black caterpillar

Now why did you do that I must say you English are rather brutal

I cant abide worms

Well neither can I And I think it would be foolish to quarrel about a
mans good looks Beatrice said with surprising sweetness

Sir Redmond hunched his shoulders and retreated to the comfort of
his pipe A bally lot of good looks he sneered A woman is never
convinced though

I am Beatrice sat down upon a rock and rested her elbows on her knees
and her chin in her handsand an adorable picture she made I assure
you Im thoroughly convinced of several things One is Mr Camerons
good looks another is that youre cross

Oh come now protested Sir Redmond feebly and sucked furiously at
his pipe

Yes reiterated Beatrice examining his perturbed face judicially
you are downright ugly

The face of Sir Redmond grew redder and more perturbed just as Beatrice
meant that it should she seemed to derive a keen pleasure from goading
this big goodlooking Englishman to the verge of apoplexy

Im sure I never meant to be rude but a fellow cant fall down and
worship every young farmer dont you knownot even to please you

Beatrice smiled and threw a pebble down the slope watching it bound and
skip to the bottom where it rolled away and hid in the grass

I love this wide country she observed abandoning her torture with
a suddenness that was a characteristic of her nature When Beatrice had
made a man look and act the fool she was ready to stop one cannot say
that of every woman One can draw long deep breaths without robbing
ones neighbor of oxygen Everything is so big and broad and generous
out here One can ride for miles and miles through the grandest wildest
placesandthere arent any cigar and bakingpowder and liverpill
signs plastered over the rocks thank goodness If man has traveled that
way before you do not have the evidence of his passing staring you
in the face You can make believe it is all your ownby right of
discovery Im afraid your England would seem rather little and crowded
after a month or two of this She swept her hand toward the river and
the grassland beyond and the mountains rimming the world

You should see the moors cried Sir Redmond brightening under this
peaceful mood of hers I fancy you would not find trouble in drawing
long breaths there Moor Cottage where your sister and Wiltmar lived
is surrounded by wide stretches of opennot like this to be sure but
not halfbad in its way either

Dolly grew to love that place though she did write homesick letters at
first I was going over after my coming outand then came that awful
accident when she and Wiltmar were both drownedand of course there
was nothing to go for I should have hated the place then I think But
I should like Her voice trailed off dreamily her eyes on the hazy
Highwoods

Sir Redmond watched her his eyes ashine Beatrice in this mood was
something to worship He was almost afraid to speak for fear she would
snuff out the tiny flame of hope which her halffinished sentence had
kindled He leaned forward his face eager

Beatrice only say you will gowith me dear

Beatrice started for the moment she had forgotten him Her eyes kept to
the hills Goto England One trip at a time Sir Redmond I have
been here only ten days and we came for three months Three months of
freedom in this big glorious place

And then His voice was husky

And thenfreckle lotions by the quart I expect

Sir Redmond got upon his feet and he was rather white around the mouth

We Englishmen are a stubborn lot Miss Beatrice We wont stop fighting
until we win

We Yankees retorted she airily value our freedom above everything
else We wont surrender it without fighting for it first

He caught eagerly at the lack of finality in her tones I dont want to
take your freedom Beatrice I only want the right to love you

Oh as for that I suppose you may love me as much as you pleaseonly
so you dont torment me to death talking about it

Beatrice not looking particularly tormented waved answer to Dick who
was shouting something up at her and went blithely down the hill with
Sir Redmond following gloomily several paces behind



CHAPTER 4 Beatrice Learns a New Language


Dyou want to see the boys work a bunch of cattle Trix Dick said
to her when she came down to where he was leaning against a high board
fence waiting for her

Deed I do Dickyonly Ive no idea what you mean

The boys are going to cut out some cattle weve contracted to the
governmentfor the Indians you know Theyre holding the bunch over in
Dry Coulee its only three or four miles Ive got to go over and see
the foreman and I thought maybe youd like to go along

Theres nothing I can think of that I would like better Wont it be
fine Sir Redmond

Sir Redmond did not say whether he thought it would be fine or not He
still had the white streak around his mouth and he went through the
gate and on to the house without a wordwhich was undoubtedly a
rude thing to do Sir Redmond was not often rude Dick watched him
speculatively until he was beyond hearing them Then What have you
done to milord Trix he wanted to know

Nothing said Beatrice

Well Dick said with decision he looks to me like a man that has
been turned downhard I can tell by the back of his neck

This struck Beatrice and she began to study the retreating neck of
her suitor I cant see any difference she announced after a brief
scrutiny

Its rather sunburned and thick

Ill gamble his mind is a jumble of good English oathswith maybe a
sprinkling of Boer maledictions What did you do

Nothingunless perhaps he objects to being disciplined a bit But I
also object to being badgered into matrimonyeven with Sir Redmond

Even with Sir Redmond Dick whistled Hes It then is he

Beatrice had nothing to say She walked beside Dick and looked at the
ground before her

He doesnt seem a bad sort sis and the title will be nice to have
in the family if one cares for such things Mother does She was
disappointed I take it that Wiltmar was a younger son

Yes she was She used to think that Sir Redmond might get killed down
there fighting the Boers and then Wiltmar would be next in line But he
didnt and it was Wiltmar who went first And now oh its humiliating
Dick To be thrown at a mans head Tears were not far from her voice
just then

I can see she wants you to nab the title Well sis if you dont care
for the man

I never said I didnt care for him But I just cant treat him
decently with mama dinning that title in my ears day and night I wish
there wasnt any title Oh its abominable Things have come to that
point where an American girl with money is not supposed to care for
an Englishman no matter how nice he may be if he has a title or the
prospect of one Every one laughs and thinks its the title she wants
theyd think it of me and theyd say it They would say Beatrice
Lansell took her halfmillion and bought her a lord And after a while
perhaps Sir Redmond himself would halfbelieve itand I couldnt bear
that And so I amunbearably flippant andI should think hed hate
me

So you reversed the natural order of things and refused him on account
of the title Dick grinned surreptitiously

No I didntnot quite Im afraid hes dreadfully angry with me
though I do wish he wasnt such a dear

Youre the same old Trix Youve got to be held back from the trail
youre supposed to take or you wont travel it youll bolt the other
way If everybody got together and fought the notion you would probably
elope with milord inside a week Mother means well but she isnt on to
her job a little bit She ought to turn up her nose at the title

No fear of that Ive had it before my eyes till I hate the very
thought of it II wish I could hate him Beatrice sighed deeply and
gave her hand to Dorman who scurried up to her

Ill have the horses saddled right away said Dick and left them

Where you going Betrice You going to ride a horse I want to
awflly

Im afraid you cant honey its too far Beatrice pushed a yellow
curl away from his eyes with tender womanly solicitude

Auntie wont care cause Im a bother Auntie says shes goin to send
for Parks I dont want Parks sides Parks is sick I want a pony and
some ledder towsers wis fringes down em and I want some little wheels
on my feet Mr Camron says I do need some little wheels Betrice

Yes he did I like Mr Camron Betrice he let me ride his big high
pony Hes a berry good pony He shaked hands wis me Betricehe truly
did

Did he hon Beatrice I am sorry to say was not listening She
was wondering if Sir Redmond was really angry with hertoo angry for
instance to go over where the cattle were He really ought to go for
he had come West in the interest of the Eastern stockholders in the
Northern Pool to investigate the actual details of the work He surely
would not miss this opportunity Beatrice thought And she hoped he was
not angry

Yes he truly did Mr Camron interduced us Betrice He said
Redcloud dis is Master Dorman Hayes Shake hands wis my frien
Dorman And he put up his front hand Betrice and nod his head and
I shaked his hand I dess love that big high pony Betrice Can I buy

Maybe

Mr Camron lives right over that hill Betrice He told me

Did he hon

Yes he did He vited me over Betrice Hes my friend and Ive got
to buy my big high pony Ill let you shake hands wis him Betrice
Ill interduce him to you And Ill let you ride on his back Betrice
Do you want to ride on his back

Yes honey

Before Beatrice had time to commit herself they reached the house and
she let go Dormans hand and hurried away to get into her ridinghabit

Dorman straightway went to find his six precious shiny pennies which
Beatrice had painstakingly scoured with silver polish one day to please
the little tyrant and which increased their value many timesso many
times in fact that he hid them every night in fear of burglars Since
he concealed them each time in a different place he was obliged to
ransack his aunties room every morning to the great disturbance of
Martha the maid who was an orderloving person

Martha appeared just when he had triumphantly pounced upon his treasure
rolled up in the strings of his aunts chiffon operabonnet

Mercy upon us Master Dorman Whatever have you been doing

I want my shiny pennies said the young gentleman composedly
unwinding the roll to buy my big high pony

Naughty naughty boy to muss my ladys fine bonnet like that Look at
things scattered over the floor and my ladys fine handkerchiefs and
gloves Martha stopped and meditated whether she might dare to shake
him

Dorman was laboriously counting his wealth with much wrinkling of
stubby nose and lifting of eyebrows Having satisfied himself that they
were really all there he deigned to look around with a fine masculine
disdain of womans finery

Oh dose old things he sniffed I always fordet where I put my shiny
pennies Robbers might find them if I put them easy places Im going to
buy my big high pony and you cant shake his hand a bit Martha

Well Im sure I dont want to Martha snapped back at him and went
down on all fours to gather up the things he had thrown down Whatever
Parks was thinking of to go and get fever when she was the only one
that could manage you I dont know And me picking up after you till
Im fair sick

Im glad you is sick he retorted unfeelingly and backed to the door
I hopes you get sicker so your stummit makes you hurt You cant ride
on my big high pony

Get along with you and your high pony cried the exasperated Martha
threatening with a hairbrush Dorman his six shiny pennies held fast in
his damp little fist fled down the stairs and out into the sunlight

Dick and Beatrice were just ready to ride away from the porch I want
to go wis you Uncle Dick Dorman had followed the lead of Beatrice
his divinity he refused to say Richard though grandmama did object to
nicknames

Up you go son Youll be a cowpuncher yourself one of these days
Ill not let him fall and this horse is gentle This last to satisfy
Dormans aunt who wavered between anxiety and relief

You may ride to the gate Dorman and then youll have to hop down
and run back to your auntie and grandma Were going too far for you
today Dick gave him the reins to hold and let the horse walk to
prolong the joy of it

Dorman held to the horn with one hand to the reins with the other and
let his small body swing forward and back with the motion of the horse
in exaggerated imitation of his friend Mr Cameron At the gate he
allowed himself to be set down without protest smiled importantly
through the bars and thrust his arm through as far as it would reach
that he might wave goodby And his divinity smiled back at him and
threw him a kiss which pleased him mightily

You must have hurt milords feelings pretty bad Dick remarked I
couldnt get him to come He had to write a letter first he said

I wish Dick Beatrice answered a bit petulantly you would stop
calling him milord

Milords a good name Dick contended Its bad enough to Sir him to
his face I cant do it behind his back Trix Were not used to fancy
titles out here and they dont fit the country anyhow Im like
youId think a lot more of him if he was just a plain everyday
American so I could get acquainted enough to call him Red Hayes Id
like him a whole lot better

Beatrice was in no mood for an argumenton that subject at least
She let Rex out and raced over the prairie at a gait which would have
greatly shocked her mother who could not understand why Beatrice was
not content to drive sedately about in the carriage with the rest of
them

When they reached the roundup Keith Cameron left the bunch and rode out
to meet them and Dick promptly shuffled responsibility for his sisters
entertainment to the square shoulders of his neighbor

Trix wants to wise up on the cattle business Keith Ill just turn her
over to you for awhile and let you answer her questions I cant half
the time I want to look through the bunch a little

Keiths face spoke gratitude and spoke it plainly The face of Beatrice
was frankly inattentive She was watching the restless moving mass of
red backs and glistening horns with horsemen weaving in and out among
them in what looked to her a perfectly aimless fashionuntil one would
wheel and dart out into the open always with a fleeing animal lumbering
before Other horsemen would meet him and take up the chase and he
would turn and ride leisurely back into the haze and confusion It was
like a kaleidoscope for the scene shifted constantly and was never
quite the same

Keith secure in her absorption slid sidewise in the saddle and studied
her face knowing all the while that he was simply storing up trouble
for himself But it is not given a man to flee human nature and the
fellow who could sit calmly beside Beatrice and not stare at her if
the opportunity offered must certainly have the blood of a fish in his
veins I will tell you why

Beatrice was tall and she was slim and round and tempting with the
most tantalizing curves ever built to torment a man Her hair was soft
and brown and it waved up from the nape of her neck without those
short straggling locks and thin growth at the edge which mar so many
feminine heads and the sharp contrast of shimmery brown against ivory
white was simply irresistible Had her face been less full of charm
Keith might have been content to gaze and gaze at that lovely hair line
As it was his eyes wandered to her brows also distinctly marked as
though outlined first with a pencil in the fingers of an artist who
understood And there were her lashes dark and long and curled up at
the ends and her cheek with its changing comeandgo coloring her
mouth with its upper lip creased deeply in the middleso deeply that a
bit more would have been a defectand with an odd little dimple at one
corner luckily it was on the side toward him so that he might look
at it all he wanted to for once for it was always there only growing
deeper and wickeder when she spoke or laughed He could not see her
eyes for they were turned away but he knew quite well the color he
had settled that point when he looked up from coiling his rope the day
she came They were big baffling bluebrown eyes the like of which he
had never seen before in his lifeand he had thought he had seen
every color and every shade under the sun Thinking of them and their
wonderful deeps and shadows he got hungry for a sight of them And
suddenly she turned to ask a question and found him staring at her and
surprised a look in his eyes he did not know was there

For ten pulsebeats they stared and the cheeks of Beatrice grew red as
healthy young blood could paint them Keiths were the same only that
his blood showed darkly through the tan What question had been on her
tongue she forgot to ask Indeed for the time I think she forgot
the whole English language and every otherbut the strange wordless
language of Keiths clear eyes

And then it was gone and Keith was looking away and chewing a
corner of his lip till it hurt His horse backed restlessly from the
tightgripped rein and Keith was guilty of kicking him with his spur
which did not better matters Redcloud snorted and shook his outraged
head and Keith came to himself and eased the rein and spoke
remorseful soothing words that somehow clung long in the memory of
Beatrice

Just after that Dick galloped up his elbows flapping like the wings of
a frightened hen

Well I suppose you could run a cow outfit all by yourself with the
knowledge youve got from Keith he greeted and two people became even
more embarrassed than before If Dick noticed anything he must have
been a wise young man for he gave no sign

But Beatrice had not queened it in her set three seasons for nothing
even if she was capable of being confused by a sweet new language in a
mans eyes She answered Dick quietly

Ive been so busy watching it all that I havent had time to ask many
questions as Mr Cameron can testify Its like a game and its very
fascinatingand dusty I wonder if I might ride in among them Dick

Better not sis It isnt as much fun as it looks and you can see more
out here There comes milord he must have changed his mind about the
letter

Beatrice did not look around To see her you would swear she had set
herself the task of making an accurate count of noses in that seething
mass of raw beef below her After a minute she ventured to glance
furtively at Keith and finding his eyes turned her way blushed again
and called herself an idiot After that she straightened in the saddle
and became the selfpoised Miss Lansell of New York

Keith rode away to the far side of the herd out of temptation queer
a man never runs from a woman until it is too late to be a particle of
use Keith simply changed his point of view and watched his Hearts
Desire from afar



CHAPTER 5 The Search for Dorman


Oh I say began Sir Redmond an hour after when he happened to stand
close to Beatrice for a few minutes where is Dorman I fancied you
brought him along

We didnt Beatrice told him He only rode as far as the gate where
Dick left him and started him back to the house

Mary told me he came along She and your mother were congratulating
each other upon a quiet halfday with you and Dorman off the place
together Ill wager their felicitations fell rather flat

Beatrice laughed Very likely I know they were mourning because their
lacemaking had been neglected lately What with that trip to Lost
Canyon tomorrow and to the mountains Friday Im afraid the lace will
continue to suffer What do you think of a roundup Sir Redmond

Its deuced nasty said he Such a lot of dust and noise I fancy the
workmen dont find it pleasant

Yes they do they like it she declared Dick says a cowboy is never
satisfied off the range And you mustnt call them workmen Sir Redmond
Theyd resent it if they knew Theyre cowboys and proud of it They
seem rather a pleasant lot of fellows on the whole I have been talking
to one or two

Well were all through here Dick announced riding up Im going
to ride around by Keiths place to see a horse Im thinking of buying
Want to go along Trix Or are you tired

Im never tired averred his sister readjusting a hatpin and
gathering up her reins I always want to go everywhere that youll take
me Dick Consider that point settled for the summer Are you coming
Sir Redmond

I think not thank you he said not quite risen above his rebuff of
the morning I told Mary I would be back for lunch

I was wiser I refused even to venture an opinion as to when I should
be back Well solong

Youre learning the lingo pretty fast Trix Dick chuckled when they
were well away from Sir Redmond Milord almost fell out of the saddle
when you fired that at him Where did you pick it up

Ive heard you say it a dozen times since I came And I dont care if
he is shockedI wanted him to be He neednt be such a perfect bear
and I know mama and Miss Hayes dont expect him to lunch without us He
just did it to be spiteful

Jerusalem Trix A little while ago you said he was a dear You
shouldnt snub him if you want him to be nice to you

I dont want him to be nice flared Beatrice I dont care how
he acts Only I must say ill humor doesnt become him Not that it
matters however

Well I guess we can get along without him if he wont honor us with
his company Here comes Keith Brace up sis and be pleasant

Beatrice glanced casually at the galloping figure of Dicks neighbor
and frowned

You mustnt flirt with Keith Dick admonished gravely Hes a good
fellow and as square a man as I know but you ought to know hes got
the reputation of being a hard man to know Lots of girls have tried
to flirt and make a fool of him and wound up with their feelings hurt
worse than his were

Is that a dare Beatrice threw up her chin with a motion Dick knew of
old

Not on your life You better leave him alone one or the other of you
would get the worst of it and Id hate to see either of you feeling
bad As I said before hes a bad man to fool with

I dont consider him particularly dangerousor interesting Hes not
half as nice as Sir Redmond Beatrice spoke as though she meant what
she said and Dick had no chance to argue the point for Keith pulled up
beside them at that moment

Beatrice seemed inclined to silence and paid more attention to the
landscape than she did to the conversation which was mostly about range
conditions and the scanty water supply and the drought

She was politely interested in Keiths ranch and if she clung
persistently to her society manner why her society manner was very
pleasing if somewhat unsatisfying to a fellow fairly drunk with her
winsomeness Keith showed her where she might look straight up the
coulee to her brothers ranch two miles away and when she wished
she might see what they were doing up there he went in and got his
fieldglass She thanked him prettily and impersonally and focused the
glass upon Dicks housewhich gave Keith another chance to look at her
without being caught in the act

How plain everything is I can see mama out on the porch and Miss
Hayes She could also see Sir Redmond who had just ridden up and was
talking to the ladies but she did not think it necessary to mention
him for some reason she kept her eyes to the glass however and
appeared much absorbed Dick rolled himself a cigarette and watched the
two and there was a twinkle in his eyes

I wonderDick I do thinkIm afraid Beatrice hadnt her society
manner now she was her unaffected girlish self and she was growing
excited

Whats the matter Dick got up and came and stood at her elbow

Theyre acting queerly The maids are running about and the cook is
out waving a large spoon and mama has her arm around Miss Hayes and
Sir Redmond

Lets see Dick took the glass and raised it to his eyes for a minute
Thats right he said Theyre making medicine over something See
what you make of it Keith

Keith took the glass and looked through it It was like a moving
picture one could see but one wanted the interpretation of sound

Wed better ride over he said quietly Dont worry Miss Lansell
it probably isnt anything serious We can take the short cut up the
coulee and find out He put the glass into its leathern case and
started to the gate where the horses were standing He did not tell
Beatrice that Miss Hayes had just been carried into the house in
a faint or that her mother was behaving in an undignified fashion
strongly suggesting hysterics But Dick knew from the look on his face
that it was serious He hurried before them with long strides leaving
Beatrice for the second time that morning to the care of his neighbor

So it was Keith who held his hand down for the delicious pressure of
her foot and arranged her habit with painstaking care considering the
hurry they were in Dick was in the saddle and gone before Keith had
finished and Keith was not a slow young man as a rule They ran the
two miles without a break except twice where there were gates to
close Dick speeding a furlong before had obligingly left them open
and a stockman is hard pressed indeedor very drunkwhen he fails to
close his gates behind him It is an unwritten law which becomes second
nature

Almost within sound of the place Dick raced back and met them and his
face was white

Its Dorman he cried Hes lost They havent seen him since we
left You know Trix he was standing at the gate

Beatrice went white as Dick whiter for she was untanned An
overwhelming sense of blame squeezed her heart tight Keith seeing her
shoulders droop limply reined close to catch her in his arms if there
was the slightest excuse However Beatrice was a healthy young woman
with splendid command of her nerves and she had no intention of
fainting The sickening weakness passed in a moment

Its my fault she said speaking rapidly her eyes seeking Dicks for
comfort I said yes to everything he asked me because I was thinking
of something else and not paying attention He was going to buy your
horse Mr Cameron and now hes lost

This though effective was not particularly illuminating Dick wanted
details and he got themfor Beatrice having remorse to stir the dregs
of memory repeated nearly everything Dorman had said even telling
how the big high pony put up his front hand and he shaked it and how
Dorman truly needed some little wheels on his feet

Poor little devil Keith muttered with wet eyes

Hehe said you lived over there Beatrice finished pointing as
Dorman had pointedwhich was not toward the Cross ranch at all but
straight toward the river

Keith wheeled Redcloud there was no need to hear more He took the hill
at a pace which would have killed any horse but one bred to race over
this rough country Near the top the forced breathing of another horse
at his heels made him look behind It was Beatrice following her eyes
like black stars I do not know if Keith was astonished but I do know
that he was pleased

Wheres Dick was all he said then

Dicks going to meet the menthe cowboys Sir Redmond went after them
when they found Dorman wasnt anywhere about the place

Keith nodded understandingly and slowed to let her come alongside

Its no use riding in bunches he remarked after a little On circle
we always go in pairs Well find him all right

We must said Beatrice simply and shaded her eyes with her hand For
they had reached the top and the prairie land lay all about them and
below lazily asleep in the sunshine

Keith halted and reached for his glass Its lucky I brought it along
he said I wasnt thinking at the time I just slung it over my
shoulder from habit

Its a good habit I think she answered trying to smile but her
lips would only quiver for the thought of her blame tortured her Can
you seeanything she ventured wistfully

Keith shook his head and continued his search There are so many
little washouts and coulees down there you know Thats the trouble
with a glassit looks only on a level But well find him Dont you
worry about that He couldnt go far

There isnt any real danger is there

Oh no Keith said Except He bit his lip angrily

Except what she demanded Im not silly Mr Camerontell me

Keith took the glass from his eyes looked at her and paid her the
compliment of deciding to tell her just as if she were a man

Nothing onlyhe might run across a snake he said Rattlers

Beatrice drew her breath hard but she was plucky Keith thought he
had never seen a pluckier girl and the West can rightfully boast brave
women

She touched Rex with the whip Come she commanded We must not stand
here It has been more than three hours

Keith put away the glass and shot ahead to guide her

We must have missed him somewhere The eyes of Beatrice were heavy
with the weariness born of anxiety and suspense They stood at the very
edge of the steep bluff which rimmed the river You dont think he
could have Her eyes shuddering down at the mocking bluegray
ripples finished the thought

He couldnt have got this far said Keith His legs would give out
climbing up and down Well go back by a little different way and
look

Theres something moving off there Beatrice pointed with her whip

Thats a coyote Keith told her and then seeing the look on her
face They wont hurt any one Theyre the rankest cowards on the
range

But the snakes

Oh well he might wander around for a week and not run across one We
wont borrow trouble anyway

No she agreed languidly The sun was hot and she had not had
anything to eat since early breakfast and the river mocked her parched
throat with its cool glimmer below She looked down at it wistfully
and Keith watchful of every passing change in her face led her back
to where a cold little spring crept from beneath a rock there lifting
her down he taught her how to drink from her hand

For himself he threw himself down pushed back his hat and drank
long and leisurely A brown lock of hair clinging softly together with
moisture fell from his forehead and trailed in the clear water and
Beatrice felt oddly tempted to push it back where it belonged Standing
quietly watching his picturesque figure she forgot for the moment
that a little boy was lost among these peaceful sunbathed hills she
remembered only the man at her feet drinking long satisfying drafts
while the lock of hair floated in the spring

Now well go on He stood up and pushed back the wet lock which
trickled a tiny stream down his cheek and settled his gray hat in
place

Again that day he felt her foot in his palm and the touch went over him
in thrills She was tired he knew her foot pressed heavier than it had
before He would have liked to take her in his arms and lift her
bodily into the saddle but he hardly dared think of such a blissful
proceeding

He set the pace slower however and avoided the steepest places and he
halted often on the higher ground to scan sharply the coulees And so
they searched these two together and grew to know each other better
than in a month of casual meetings And the grass nodded and the winds
laughed and the stern hills looked on quizzically silent If they knew
aught of a small boy with a wealth of yellow curls and white collar
they gave no sign and the two rode on always seeking hopefully

A snake buzzed sharply on a gravelly slope and Keith sending Beatrice
back a safe distance took down his rope and gave battle beating the
sinister grayspotted coil with the loop until it straightened and
was still He dismounted then and pinched off the rattlesnine
there were and a buttonand gave them to Beatrice who handled them
gingerly and begged Keith to carry them for her He slipped them into
his pocket and they went on saying little

Back near the ranch they met Dick and Sir Redmond They exchanged sharp
looks and Dick shook his head

We havent found himyet The boys are riding circle around the ranch
theyre bound to find him some of them if we dont

You had better go home Sir Redmond told her with a note of authority
in his voice which set Keiths teeth on edge You look done to death
this is mens work

Beatrice bit her lip and barely glanced at him Ill gowhen Dorman
is found What shall we do now Dick

Go down to the house and get some hot coffee you two We all snatched
a bite to eat and you need it After that you can look along the south
side of the coulee if you like

Beatrice obediently turned Rex toward home and Keith followed The
ranch seemed very still and lonesome Some chickens were rolling in the
dust by the gate and scattered cackling indignantly when they rode
up Off to the left a colt whinnied wistfully in a corral Beatrice
riding listlessly to the house stopped her horse with a jerk

I heardwhere is he

Keith stopped Redcloud and listened Came a thumping noise and a wail
not loud but unmistakable

Auntie

Beatrice was on the ground as soon as Keith and together they ran to
the placethe bunkhouse The thumping continued vigorously evidently
a small boy was kicking with all his might upon a closed door it was
not a new sound to the ears of Beatrice since the arrival in America
of her young nephew Keith flung the door wide open upsetting the small
boy who howled

Beatrice swooped down upon him and gathered him so close she came near
choking him You darling Oh Dorman

Dorman squirmed away from her I los one shiny penny Betriceand I
couldnt open de door Help me find my shiny penny

Keith picked him up and set him upon one square shoulder Well take
you up to your auntie first thing young man

I want my one shiny penny I want it Dorman showed symptoms of
howling again

Well come back and find it Your auntie wants you now and grandmama

Beatrice following after was treated to a rather unusual spectacle
that of a tall sunbrowned fellow with fringed chaps and brightly
gleaming spurs racing down the path upon his shoulder the wriggling
form of an extremely disreputable small boy with cobwebs in his curls
and his once white collar a dirty rag streaming out behind



CHAPTER 6 Mrs Lansells Lecture


When the excitement had somewhat abated and Miss Hayes was convinced
that her idol was really there safe and with his usual healthy
appetite and when a messenger had been started out to recall the
searchers Dorman was placed upon a chair before a select and attentive
audience and invited to explain which he did

He had decided to borrow some little wheels from the bunkhouse so he
could ride his big high pony home Mr Cameron had little wheels on
his feet and so did Uncle Dick and all the mens The audience gravely
nodded assent Well and the knob wasnt too high when he went in but
when he tried to open the door to go out it was away up there Dorman
measured with his arm And he fell down and all his shiny pennies
rolled and rolled And he looked and looked where they rolled and when
he counted one was gone So he looked and looked for the one shiny
penny till he was tired to death And so he climbed up high into a
funny bed on a shelf and rested And when he was rested he couldnt
open the door and he kicked and kicked and then Betrice came and Mr
Camron

And you said youd help me find my one penny he reminded Keith
blinking solemnly at him from the chair And I want to shake hands wis
your big high pony Im going to buy him wis my six pennies Betrice
said I could

Beatrice blushed and Keith forgot where he was for a minute looking
at her

Come and find my one shiny penny Dorman commanded climbing down
And I want Betrice to come Betrice can always find things

Beatrice cannot go said his grandmother who didnt much like the
way Keith hovered near Beatrice nor the look in his eyes Beatrice is
tired

I want Betrice Dorman set up his everyday howl which started the
dogs barking outside His guardian angel attempted to soothe him but he
would have none of her he only howled the louder and kicked

There there honey Ill go Wheres your hat

Beatrice you had better stay in the house you have done quite enough
for one day The tone of the mother suggested things

It is imperative said Beatrice for the peace and the wellbeing of
this household that Dorman find his penny without delay When
Beatrice adopted that lofty tone her mother was in the habit of saying
nothingand biding her time Beatrice was so apt if mere loftiness did
not carry the day to go a step further and flatly refuse to obey Mrs
Lansell preferred to yield rather than be openly defied

So the three went off to find the shiny pennyand in exactly
thirtyfive minutes they found it I will not say that they could not
have found it sooner but at any rate they didnt and they reached
the house about two minutes behind Dick and Sir Redmond which did not
improve Sir Redmonds temper to speak of

After that Keith did not need much urging from Dick to spend the rest
of the afternoon at the Pool ranch When he wanted to Keith could be
very nice indeed to people he went a long way that afternoon toward
making a friend of Miss Hayes but Mrs Lansell who was one of those
women who adhere to the theory of First Impressions in capitals
continued to regard him as an incipient outlaw who would in time and
under favorable conditions reveal his true character and vindicate her
keen insight into human nature There was one thing which Mrs Lansell
never forgave Keith Cameron and that was the ruin of her watch which
refused to run while she was in Montana

That night when Beatrice was just snuggling down into the delicious
coolness of her pillow she heard someone rap softly but none the less
imperatively on her door She opened one eye stealthily to see her
mothers pudgy form outlined in the feeble moonlight

Beatrice are you asleep

Beatrice did not say yes but she let her breath out carefully in a
slumbrous sigh It certainly sounded as if she were asleep

Beatrice The tone though guarded was insistent

The head of Beatrice moved slightly and settled back into its little
nest for all the world like a dreaming innocent baby

If she had not been the mother of Beatrice Mrs Lansell would probably
have gone back to her room and continued to bide her time but the
mother of Beatrice had learned a few things about the ways of a wilful
girl She went in and closed the door carefully behind her She did not
wish to keep the whole house awake Then she went straight to the bed
laid hand upon a white shoulder that gleamed in the moonlight and gave
a shake

Beatrice I want you to answer me when I speak

Mmdid yoummspeak mama Beatrice opened her eyes and closed
them opened them again for a minute longer yawned daintily and by
these signs and tokens wandered back from dreamland obediently

Her mother sat down upon the edge of the bed and the bed creaked Also
Beatrice groaned inwardly the time of reckoning was verily drawing
near She promptly closed her eyes again and gave a sleepy sigh

Beatrice did you refuse Sir Redmond again

Mmwere you speakingmama

Mrs Lansell endeavoring to keep her temper repeated the question

Beatrice began to feel that she was an abused girl She lifted herself
to her elbow and thumped the pillow spitefully

Again Dear me mama Ive never refused him once

You havent accepted him once either her mother retorted and
Beatrice lay down again

I do wish Beatrice you would look at the matter in a sensible light
Im sure I never would ask you to marry a man you could not care for
But Sir Redmond is young and goodlooking and has birth and breeding
and moneyno one can accuse him of being a fortunehunter Im sure
I was asking Richard today and he says Sir Redmond holds a large
interest in the Northern Pool and other English investors pay him a
salary besides to look after their interests I wouldnt be surprised
if the holdings of both of you would be sufficient to control the
business

Beatrice not caring anything for business anyway said nothing

Any one can see the mans crazy for you His sister says he never cared
for a woman before in his life

Of course put in Beatrice sarcastically His sister followed him
down to South Africa and all around and is in a position to know

Any one can see he isnt a ladys man

No Beatrice smiled reminiscently he certainly isnt

And so hes in deadly earnest And Im positive he will make you a
model husband

Only think of having to live all ones life with a model husband
shuddered Beatrice hypocritically

Beatrice And then its something to marry a title

Thats the worst of it remarked Beatrice

Any other girl in America would jump at the chance I do believe
Beatrice you are hanging back just to be aggravating And theres
another thing Beatrice I dont approve of the way this Keith Cameron
hangs around you

He doesnt denied Beatrice in an altogether different tone Why
mama

I dont approve of flirting Beatrice and you know it The way
you gadded around over the hills with hima perfect strangerwas
disgraceful perfectly disgraceful You dont know any thing about the
fellow whether hes a fit companion or nota wild uncouth cowboy

He graduated from Yale a year after Dick And he was halfback too

That doesnt signify said her mother a particle I know Miss Hayes
was dreadfully shocked to see you come riding up with him and Sir
Redmond forced to go with Richard or ride alone

Dick is good company said Beatrice And it was his own fault
I asked him to go with us when Dick and I left the cattle and he
wouldnt Dick will tell you the same And after that I did not see
him until just before weI came home Really mama I cant have a
leadingstring on Sir Redmond If he refuses to come with me I can
hardly insist

Well you must have done something You said something or did
something to make him very angry He has not been himself all day What
did you say

Dear me mama I am not responsible for all Sir Redmonds illhumor

I did not ask you that Beatrice

Beatrice thumped her pillow again I dont remember anything very
dreadful mama II think he has indigestion

Beatrice I do wish you would try to conquer that habit of flippancy
It is not ladylike And I warn you Sir Redmond is not the man to dangle
after you forever He will lose patience and go back to England without
youand serve you right I am only talking for your own good Beatrice
I am not at all sure that you want him to leave you alone

Beatrice was not at all sure either She lay still and wished her
mother would stop talking for her good Talking for her good had meant
as far back as Beatrice could remember saying disagreeable things in a
disagreeable manner

And remember Beatrice I want this flirting stopped

Flirting mama To hear the girl you would think she had never heard
the word before

Thats what I said Beatrice I shall speak to Richard in the morning
about this fellow Cameron He must put a stop to his being here
twothirds of the time It is unendurable

He and Dick are chums mama and have been for years And tomorrow we
are going to Lost Canyon you know and Mr Cameron is to go along And
there are several other trips mama to which he is already invited
Dick cannot recall those invitations

Well it must end there Richard must do something I cannot see
what he finds about the fellow to likeor you either Beatrice Just
because he rides like aa wild Indian and has a certain daredevil
way

I never said I liked him mama Beatrice protested somewhat hastily
Iof course I try to treat him well

I should say you did exploded her mother angrily You would be
much better employed in trying to treat Sir Redmond half as well It is
positively disgraceful the way you behave toward himas fine a man as
I ever met in my life I warn you Beatrice you must have more regard
for propriety or I shall take you back to New York at once I certainly
shall

With that threat which she shrewdly guessed would go far toward
bringing this wayward girl to time Mrs Lansell got up off the bed
which creaked its relief and groped her way to her own room

The pillow of Beatrice received considerable thumping during the next
houra great deal more in fact than it needed Two thoughts troubled
her more than she liked What if her mother was right and Sir Redmond
lost patience with her and went home That possibility was unpleasant
to say the least Again would he give her up altogether if she showed
Dick she was not afraid of Keith Cameron for all his good looks and at
the same time taught that young man a muchneeded lesson The way he had
stared at her was nothing less than a challenge and Beatrice was sorely
tempted



CHAPTER 7 Beatrices Wild Ride


Well are we all ready Dick gathered up his reins and took critical
inventory of the load His mother peered under the front seat to be
doubly sure that there were at least four umbrellas and her waterproof
raglan in the rig Mrs Lansell did not propose to be caught unawares in
a storm another time Miss Hayes straightened Dormans cap and told
him to sit down dear and then called upon Sir Redmond to enforce the
command Sir Redmond repeated her command minus the dear and then rode
on ahead to overtake Beatrice and Keith who had started Dick climbed
up over the front wheel released the brake chirped at the horses and
they were off for Lost Canyon

Beatrice was behaving beautifully and her mother only hoped to heaven
it would last the day out perhaps Sir Redmond would be able to extract
some sort of a promise from her in that mood Mrs Lansell reflected
as she watched Beatrice chatting to her two cavaliers with the most
decorous impartiality Sir Redmond seemed in high spirits which argued
well Mrs Lansell gave herself up to the pleasure of the drive with
a heart free from anxiety Not only was Beatrice at her best Dormans
mood was nothing short of angelic and as the weather was simply
perfect the day surely promised well

For a mile Keith had showed signs of a mind not at ease and at last he
made bold to speak

I thought Rex was to be your saddlehorse he said abruptly to
Beatrice

He was but when Dick brought Goldie home last night I fell in love
with him on sight and just teased Dick till he told me I might have him
to ride

I thought Dick had some sense Keith said gloomily

He has He knew there would be no peace till he surrendered

I didnt know you were going to ride him when I sold him to Dick Hes
not safe for a woman

Does he buck Mr Cameron Dick said he was gentle Beatrice had seen
a horse buck one day and had a wholesome fear of that form of equine
amusement

Oh no I never knew him to

Then I dont mind anything else Im accustomed to horses said
Beatrice and smiled welcome to Sir Redmond who came up with them at
that moment

You want to ride him with a light rein Keith cautioned clinging to
the subject Hes tenderbitted and nervous He wont stand for any
jerking you see

I never jerk Mr Cameron Keith discovered that big baffling
bluebrown eyes can if they wish rival liquid air for coldness I
rode horses before I came to Montana

Of course when a man gets frozen with a girls eyes and scorched
with a girls sarcasm the thing for him to do is to retreat until the
atmosphere becomes normal Keith fell behind just as soon as he could
do so with some show of dignity and for several miles tried to convince
himself that he would rather talk to Dick and the old maid than not

Dont you know Sir Redmond remarked sympathetically some of these
Western fellows are inclined to be deuced officious and impertinent

Sir Redmond got a taste of the freezing process that made him change the
subject abruptly

The way was rough and lonely the trail wound over sharpnosed hills and
through deep narrow coulees with occasional tantalizing glimpses of
the river and the open land beyond that kept Beatrice in a fever of
enthusiasm From riding blithely ahead she took to lagging far behind
with her kodak getting snapshots of the choicest bits of scenery

Another cartridge please Sir Redmond she said and wound
industriously on the finished roll

Its a jolly good thing I brought my pockets full Sir Redmond fished
one out for her Was that a dozen

No that had only six films I want a larger one this time It is a
perfect nuisance to stop and change Be still Goldie

Were getting rather a long way behindbut I fancy the road is plain

Well hurry and overtake them I wont take any more pictures

Until you chance upon something you cant resist I understand all
that you know Sir Redmond while he teased was pondering whether
this was an auspicious time and place to ask Beatrice to marry him He
had tried so many times and places that seemed auspicious that the man
was growing fearful It is not pleasant to have a girl smile indulgently
upon you and deftly turn your avowals aside so that they fall flat

Im ready she announced blind to what his eyes were saying

Shall we trek Sir Redmond sighed a bit He was not anxious to
overtake the others

We will Only out here people never trek Sir Redmond They hit the
trail

So they do And the way these cowboys do it one would think they were
couriers by Jove with the lives of a whole army at stake So I fancy
we had better hit the trail eh

Youre learning Beatrice assured him as they started on A year out
here and you would be a real American Sir Redmond

Sir Redmond came near saying The Lord forbid but he thought better
of it Beatrice was intensely loyal to her countrymen unfortunately
and would certainly resent such a remark but for all that he thought
it

For a mile or two she held to her resolve and then at the top of a
long hill overlooking the canyon where they were to eat their lunch out
came her kodak again

This must be Lost Canyon for Dick has stopped by those trees I want
to get just one view from here Steady Goldie Dear me this horse does
detest standing still

I fancy he is anxious to get down with the others Let me hold him for
you Whoa there He put a hand upon the bridle a familiarity Goldie
resented He snorted and dodged backward to the ruin of the picture
Beatrice was endeavoring to get

Now youve frightened him Whoa pet Its of no use to try he wont
stand

Let me have your camera Hes getting rather an ugly temper I think
Sir Redmond put out his hand again and again Goldie dodged backward

I can do better alone Sir Redmond The cheeks of Beatrice were red
She managed to hold the horse in until her kodak was put safely in its
case but her temper as well as Goldies was roughened She hated
spoiling a film which she was perfectly sure she had done

Goldie felt the sting of her whip when she brought him back into the
road and from merely fretting he took to plunging angrily Then when
Beatrice pulled him up sharply he thrust out his nose grabbed the bit
in his teeth and bolted down the hill past all control

Good God hold him shouted Sir Redmond putting his horse to a run

The advice was good and Beatrice heard it plainly enough but she
neither answered nor looked back How she thought resentfully was one
to hold a yellow streak of rage with legs like wire springs and a neck
of iron Besides she was angrily alive to the fact that Keith Cameron
watching down below was having his revenge She wondered if he was
enjoying it

He was not Goldie when he ran ran blindly in a straight line and
Keith knew it He also knew that the Englishman couldnt keep within
gunshot of Goldie with the mount he had and half a mile awayKeith
shut his teeth hard together and went out to meet her Redcloud lay
along the ground in great leaps but Keith bending low over his neck
urged him faster and faster until the horse his ears laid close
against his neck did the best there was in him From the tail of his
eye Keith saw Sir Redmonds horse go down upon his knees and get up
limpingand the sight filled him with ungenerous gladness Sir Redmond
was out of the race It was Keith and Redcloudthey two and Keith
could smile over it

He saw Beatrices hat loosen and lift in front flop uncertainly and
then go sailing away into the sagebrush and he noted where it fell
that he might find it later Then he was close enough to see her face
and wondered that there was so little fear written there Beatrice was
plucky and she rode well her weight upon the bit but her weight was
nothing to the clinched teeth of the horse and though she had known
it from the start she was scarcely frightened There was a good deal of
the daredevil in Beatrice she trusted a great deal to blind luck

Just there the land was level and she hoped to check him on the slope
of the hill before them She did not know it was moated like a castle
with a washout ten feet deep and twice that in width and that what
looked to her quite easy was utterly impossible

Keith gained every leap In a moment he was close behind

Take your foot out of the stirrup he commanded harshly and though
Beatrice wondered why something in his voice made her obey

Now Redclouds nose was even with her elbow the breath from his
wideflaring nostrils rose hotly in her face Another bound and he had
forged ahead neck and neck with Goldie and it was Keith by her side
keeneyed and calm

Let go all hold he said Reaching suddenly he caught her around the
waist and pulled her from the saddle just as Redcloud scenting danger
plowed his front feet deeply into the loose soil and stopped dead still

It was neatly done and quickly so quickly that before Beatrice had
more than gasped her surprise Keith lowered her to the ground and slid
out of the saddle Beatrice looked at him and wondered at his face and
at the way he was shaking He leaned weakly against the horse and hid
his face on his arm and trembled at what had come so close to the
girlthe girl who stood there panting a little with her wonderful
waving hair cloaking her almost to her knees and her bluebrown eyes
wide and bright and full of a deep amazement She forgot Goldie and
did not even look to see what had become of him she forgot nearly
everything just then in wonder at this tall cleanbuilt young fellow
who never had seemed to care what happened leaning there with his face
hidden his hat far hack on his head and little drops standing thickly
upon his forehead She waited a moment and when he did not move her
thoughts drifted to other things

I wonder she said abstractedly if I broke my kodak

Keith lifted his head and looked at her Your kodakgood Lord He
looked hard into her eyes and she returned the stare

Come here he commanded hoarsely catching her arm Your kodak Look
down there He led her to the brink which was close enough to set him
shuddering anew Look Theres Goldie damn him Its a wonder hes
on his feet I thought hed be deadand serve him right And youyou
wonder if you broke your kodak

Beatrice drew back from him and from the sight below and if she were
frightened she tried not to let him see Should I have fainted
She was proud of the steadiness of her voice Really I am very much
obliged to you Mr Cameron for saving me from an ugly fall You did it
very neatly I imagine and I am grateful Still I really hope I didnt
break my kodak Are you very disappointed because I cant faint away
There doesnt seem to be any brook close by you seeand I havent my
erlovers arms to fall into Those are the regulation stage settings
I believe and

Dont worry Miss Lansell I didnt expect you to faint or to show any
human feelings whatever I do pity your horse though

You didnt a minute ago she reminded him You indulged in a bit of
profanity if I remember

For which I beg Goldies pardon he retorted his eyes unsmiling

And mine I hope

Certainly

I think its rather absurd to stand here sparring Mr Cameron Youll
begin to accuse me of ingratitude and Im as grateful as possible for
what you did Sir Redmonds horse was too slow to keep up or he would
have been at hand no doubt

And could have supplied part of the stage setting Too bad he was
behind Keith turned and readjusted the cinch on his saddle though it
was not loose enough to matter and before he had finished Sir Redmond
rode up

Are you hurt Beatrice His face was pale and his eyes anxious

Not at all Mr Cameron kindly helped me from the saddle in time to
prevent an accident I wish youd thank him Sir Redmond I havent the
words

You neednt trouble said Keith hastily getting into the saddle
Ill go down after Goldie You can easily find the camp I guess
without a pilot Then he galloped away and left them and would
not look back if he had done so he would have seen Beatrices eyes
following him remorsefully Also he would have seen Sir Redmond glare
after him jealously for Sir Redmond was not in a position to know that
their teteatete had not been a pleasant one and no man likes to have
another fellow save the life of a woman he loves while he himself is
limping painfully up from the rear

However the woman he loved was very gracious to him that day and for
many days and Keith Cameron held himself aloof during the rest of the
trip which should have contented Sir Redmond



CHAPTER 8 Dorman Plays Cupid


Dorman toiled up the steps his straw hat perilously near to slipping
down his back his face like a large red beet and his hands vainly
trying to reach around a bakingpowder can which the Chinaman cook had
given him

He marched straight to where Beatrice was lying in the hammock If she
had been older or younger or a plain young woman one might say that
Beatrice was sulking in the hammock for she had not spoken anything but
yes and no to her mother for an hour and she had only spoken
those two words occasionally when duty demanded it For one thing
Sir Redmond was absent and had been for two weeks and Beatrice was
beginning to miss him dreadfully To beguile the time she had ridden
every day long miles into the hills Three times she had met Keith
Cameron also riding alone in the hills and she had endeavored to amuse
herself with him after her own inimitable fashion and with more or
less success The trouble was that sometimes Keith seemed to be amusing
himself with her which was not pleasing to a girl like Beatrice At any
rate he proved himself quite able to play the game of Give and Take
so that the conscience of Beatrice was at ease no one could call her
pastime a slaughter of the innocents surely when the fellow stood his
ground like that It was more a fencingbout and Beatrice enjoyed it
very much she told herself that the reason she enjoyed talking with
Keith was because he was not always getting hurt like Sir Redmondor
if he did he kept his feelings to himself and went boldly on with
the game Item Beatrice had reversed her decision that Keith was
vain though she still felt tempted at times to resort to making
faceswhen she was worsted that was

To return to this particular day of sulking Rex had cast a shoe and
lamed himself just enough to prevent her riding and so Beatrice was
having a dull day of it in the house Besides her mother had just
finished talking to her for her good which was enough to send an angel
into the sulksand Beatrice lacked a good deal of being an angel

Dorman laid his bakingpowder can confidingly in his divinitys lap
Betrice I did get some grasshoppers you said I couldnt And
you wouldnt go fishin cause you didnt like to take Uncle Dicks
makemlieve flies so I got some really ones Betrice thatll wiggle
dere own self

Oh dear me Its too hot Dorman

Tisnt Betrice Its dest as cooland by de brook its awflly
cold Come Betrice He pulled at the smart little pink ruffles on her
skirt

Im too sleepy hon

You can sleep by de brook Betrice Ill let you he promised
generously cept when I need anudder grasshopper nen Ill wake you
up

Wait till tomorrow I dont believe the fish are hungry today Dont
tear my skirt to pieces Dorman

Dorman began to whine He had never found his divinity in so unlovely
a mood I want to go now Dey are too hungry Betrice Looey Sam is
goin to fry my fishes for dinner to sprise auntie Come Betrice

Why dont you go with the child Beatrice You grow more selfish every
day Mrs Lansell could not endure selfishnessin others You know he
will not give us any peace until you do

Dorman instantly proceeded to make good his grandmothers prophecy and
wept so that one could hear him a mile

Oh dear me Be still Dormanyour auntie has a headache Well get
your rod if you know where it iswhich I doubt Beatrice flounced
out of the hammock and got her hat one of those floppy white things
fluffed with thin white stuff till they look like nothing so much as
a wisp of cloud with ribbons to moor it to her head and keep it from
sailing off to join its brothers in the sky

Down by the creek where the willows nodded to their own reflections in
the still places it was cool and sweet scented and Beatrice forgot her
grievances and was not sorry she had come

It was at about this time that a tall young fellow two miles down the
coulee put away his field glass and went off to saddle his horse

Dont run ahead so Dorman Beatrice cautioned To her had been given
the doubtful honor of carrying the bakingpowder can of grasshoppers
Even divinities must make themselves useful to man

Why Betrice Dorman swished his rod in unpleasant proximity to his
divinitys head

Because honeyBeatrice dodgedyou might step on a snake a
rattlesnake that would bite you

How would it bite Betrice

With its teeth of course long wicked teeth with poison on them

I saw one when I was ridin on a horse wis Uncle Dick It kept windin
up till it was round and it growled wis its tail Betrice And Uncle
Dick chased it and nen it unwinded itself and creeped under a big rock
It didnt bite onceand I didnt see any teeth to it

Carry your rod still Dorman Are you trying to knock my hat off my
head Rattlesnakes have teeth hon whether you saw them or not I saw a
great long one that day we thought you were lost Mr Cameron killed it
with his rope Im sure it had teeth

Did it growl Betrice Tell me how it went

Like this hon Beatrice parted her lips ever so little and a
snake buzzed at Dormans feet He gave a yell of terror and backed
ingloriously

You see honey if that had been really a snake it would have bitten
you Never mind dearit was only I

Dorman was some time believing this astonishing statement How did you
growl by my feet Betrice Show me again

Beatrice who had learned some things at school which were not included
in the curriculum repeated the performance while Dorman watched her
with eyes and mouth at their widest Like some older members of his sex
he was discovering new witcheries about his divinity every day

Well Betrice He gave a long gasp of ecstasy I dont see how can
you do it Cant I do it Betrice

Im afraid not honeyyoud have to learn There was a queer French
girl at school who could do the strangest things Dormanlike fairy
tales almost And she taught me to throw my voice different places and
mimic sounds when we should have been at our lessons Listen hon
This is how a little lamb cries when he is lost And this is what a
hungry kittie says when she is away up in a tree and is afraid to come
down

Dorman danced all around his divinity and forgot about the fishuntil
Beatrice found it in her heart to regret her rash revelation of hitherto
undreamedof powers of entertainment

Not another sound Dorman she declared at length with the firmness
of despair No I will not be a lost lamb another once No nor a
hungry kittie eithernor a snake or anything If you are not going to
fish I shall go straight back to the house

Dorman sighed heavily and permitted his divinity to fasten a small
grasshopper to his hook

Well go a bit farther dear down under those great trees And you
must not speak a word remember or the fish will all run away

When she had settled him in a likely place and the rapt patience of the
born angler had folded him close she disposed herself comfortably in
the thick grass her back against a tree and took up the shuttle of
fancy to weave a wonderful daydream as beautiful intangible as the
lacy summer clouds over her head

A man rode quietly over the grass and stopped two rods away that he
might fill his hungry eyes with the delicious loveliness of his Hearts
Desire

Got a bite yet

Dorman turned and wrinkled his nose by way of welcome and shook his
head vaguely as though he might tell of several unimportant nibbles if
it were worth the effort

Beatrice sat a bit straighter and dexterously whisked some pink ruffles
down over two distracting ankles and hoped Keith had not taken notice
of them He had though trust a man for that

Keith dismounted dropped the reins to the ground and came and laid
himself down in the grass beside his Hearts Desire and Beatrice
noticed how tall he was and slim and strong

How did you know we were here she wanted to know with lifted
eyebrows

Keith wondered if there was a welcome behind that sweet indifferent
face He never could be sure of anything in Beatrices face because it
never was alike twice it seemed to himand if it spoke welcome for
a second the next there was only raillery or something equally
unsatisfying

I saw you from the trail he answered promptly evidently not thinking
it wise to mention the fieldglass And then Is Dick at home Not
that he wanted Dickbut a fellow even when he is in the last stages of
love feels need of an excuse sometimes

Nowe women are alone today There isnt a man on the place except
Looey Sam and he doesnt count

Dorman squirmed around till he could look at the two and his eyebrows
were tied in a knot I wish Betrice you wouldnt talk less you
whisper De fishes wont bite a bit

All right honeywe wont

Dorman turned back to his fishing with a long breath of relief His
divinity never broke a promise if she could help it

If Dorman Hayes had been Cupid himself he could not have hit upon a
more impish arrangement than that To place a girl like Beatrice beside
a fellow like Keitha fellow who is tall and browned and extremely
goodlooking and who has hazel eyes with a laugh in them alwaysa
fellow moreover who is very much in love and very much in earnest
about itand condemn him to silence or to whispers

Keith took advantage of the edict and moved closer so that he could
whisper in comfortand be nearer his Hearts Desire He lay with his
head propped upon his hand and his elbow digging into the sod and
getting grassstains on his shirt sleeve for the day was too warm for a
coat Beatrice looking down at him observed that his forearm between
his glove and wristband was as white and smooth as her own It is
characteristic of a cowboy to have a face brown as an Indian and hands
girlishly white and soft

I havent had a glimpse of you for a weeknot since I met you down by
the river Where have you been he whispered

Here Rex went lame and Dick wouldnt let me ride any other horse
since that day Goldie boltedand so the hills have called in vain Ive
stayed at home and made quantities of Duchesse laceI almost finished
a love of a center pieceand mama thinks I have reformed But Rex is
better and tomorrow Im going somewhere

Better help me hunt some horses that have been running down Lost Canyon
way Im going to look for them tomorrow Keith suggested as calmly
as was compatible with his eagerness and his method of speech I doubt
if any man can whisper things to a girl he loves and do it calmly I
know Keiths heart was pounding

I shall probably ride in the opposite direction Beatrice told him
wickedly She wondered if he thought she would run at his beck

I never saw you in this dress before Keith murmured his eyes
caressing

No You may never again she said I have so many things to wear out
you know

I like it he declared as emphatically as he could and whisper It
is just the color of your cheeks after the wind has been kissing them a
while

Fancy a cowboy saying pretty things like that

Beatrices cheeks did not wait for the wind to kiss them pink

Yaas only fawncy ye knaw His eyes were daringly mocking

For shame Mr Cameron Sir Redmond would not mimic your speech

Good reason why he couldnt not if he tried a thousand years

Beatrice knew this was the truth so she fell back upon dignity

We will not discuss that subject I think

I dont want to anyway I know another subject a million times more
interesting than Sir Redmond

Indeed Beatrices eyebrows were at their highest And what is it
then

You Keith caught her hand his eyes compelled her

I think said Beatrice drawing her hand away we will not discuss
that subject either

Why Keiths eyes continued to woo

Because

It occurred to Beatrice that an unsophisticated girl might easily think
Keith in earnest with that look in his eyes

Dorman scowling at them over his shoulder unconsciously did his
divinity a service Beatrice pursed her lips in a way that drove Keith
nearly wild and took up the weapon of silence

You said you women are alonewhere is milord Keith began again
after two minutes of lying there watching her

Sir Redmond is in Helena on business Hes been making arrangements to
lease a lot of land

Ahh Keith snapped a twig off a dead willow

We look for him home today and Dick drove in to meet the train

So the Pool has gone to leasing land The laugh had gone out of
Keiths eyes they were clear and keen

Yesthe plan is to lease the Pine Ridge country and fence it I
suppose you know where that is

I ought to Keith said quietly Its funny Dick never mentioned it

It isnt Dicks idea Beatrice told him It was Sir Redmonds Dick
is rather angry I think and came near quarreling with Sir Redmond
about it But English capital controls the Pool you know and Sir
Redmond controls the English capital so he can adopt whatever policy
he chooses The way he explained the thing to me it seems a splendid
plandont you think so

Yes Keiths tone was not quite what he meant it to be he did not
intend it to be ironical as it was Its a snap for the Pool all
right It gives them a cinch on the best of the range and all the
water I didnt give milord credit for such business sagacity

Beatrice leaned over that she might read his eyes but Keith turned
his face away In the shock of what he had just learned he was at the
moment not the lover he was the small cattleman who is being forced
out of the business by the octopus of combined capital It was not less
bitter that the woman he loved was one of the tentacles reaching out to
crush him And they could do it theythe whole affair resolved itself
into a very simple scheme to Keith The gauntlet had been thrown
downbecause of this girl beside him It was not so much business
acumen as it was the antagonism of a rival that had prompted the move
Keith squared his shoulders and mentally took up the gauntlet He might
lose in the range fight but he would win the girl if it were in the
power of love to do it

Why that tone I hope it isntwill it inconvenience you

Oh no No not at all No Keith seemed to forget that a
superabundance of negatives breeds suspicion of sincerity

Im afraid that means that it will And Im sure Sir Redmond never
meant

I believe that kid has got a bite at last Keith interrupted getting
up Let me take hold there Dorman youll be in the creek yourself in
a second He landed a fourinch fish carefully rebaited the hook cast
the line into a promising eddy gave the rod over to Dorman and went
back to Beatrice who had been watching him with troubled eyes

Mr Cameron if I had known Beatrice was goodhearted if she was
fond of playing with a mans heart

I hope youre not letting that business worry you Miss Lansell You
remind me of a painting I saw once in Boston It was called June

But this is August so I dont apply Isnt there some way you

Did you hear about that trainrobbery up the line last week Keith
settled himself luxuriously upon his back with his hands clasped under
his head and his hat tipped down over his eyesbut not enough
to prevent him from watching his Hearts Desire And in his eyes
laughterand something sweeterlurked If Sir Redmond had wealth to
fight with Keiths weapon was far and away more dangerous for it was
the irresistible love of a masterful manthe love that sweeps obstacles
away like straws

I am not interested in trainrobberies Beatrice told him her eyes
still clouded with trouble I want to talk about this lease

They got one fellow the next day and another got rattled and gave
himself up but the leader of the gang one of Montanas pet outlaws
is still ranging somewhere in the hills You want to be careful about
riding off alone you ought to let some oneme for instancego along
to look after you

Pshaw said his Hearts Desire smiling reluctantly Im not afraid
Do you suppose if Sir Redmond had known

Those fellows made quite a haulalmost enough to lease the whole
country if they wanted to Something over fifty thousand dollarsand a
strong box full of sand that the messenger was going to fool them with
He did all right but they werent so slow They hustled around and got
the money and he lost his sand into the bargain

Was that meant for a pun Beatrice blinked her big eyes at him If
youre quite through with the trainrobbers perhaps you will tell me
how

Im glad old Mother Nature didnt give every woman an odd dimple beside
the mouth Keith observed reaching for her hat and running a ribbon
caressingly through his fingers

Why Beatrice smoothed the dimple complacently with her fingertips

Why Oh it would get kind of monotonous wouldnt it

This from a man known chiefly for his pretty speeches Beatrices
laugh had a faint tinge of chagrin

Wouldnt pretty speeches get monotonous too Keiths eyes were
laughing at her

Yours wouldnt she retorted spitefully and immediately bit her lip
and hoped he would not consider that a bid for more pretty speeches

Betrice dis hopper is awflly wilted came a sepulchral whisper from
Dorman

Keith sighed and went and baited the hook again When he returned to
Beatrice his mood had changed

I want you to promise

I never make promises of any sort Mr Cameron Beatrice had
fallen back upon her airy tone which was her strongest weapon of
defenseunless one except her liquidair smile

I wasnt thinking of asking much Keith went on coolly I only wanted
to ask you not to worry about that leasing business

Are you worrying about it Mr Cameron

That isnt the point No I cant say I expect to lose sleep over it I
hope you will dismiss anything I may have said from your mind

But I dont understand I feel that you blame Sir Redmond when Im
sure he

I did not say I blamed anybody I think well not discuss it

Yes I think we shall Youll tell me all about it if I want to know
Beatrice adopted her coaxing tone which never had failed her

Oh no Keith laughed a little A girl cant always have her own way
just because she wants it even if she

Ive got a fish Mr Camron Dorman squealed and Keith was obliged
to devote another five minutes to diplomacy

I think you have fished long enough honey Beatrice told Dorman
decidedly Its nearly dinner time and Looey Sam wont have time to
fry your fish if you dont hurry home Shall I tell Dick you wished to
see him Mr Cameron

Its nothing important so I wont trouble you Keith replied in
a tone that matched hers for cool courtesy Ill see him tomorrow
probably He helped Dorman reel in his line cut a willowwand and
strung the three fish upon it by the gills washed his hands leisurely
in the creek and dried them on his handkerchief just as if nothing
bothered him in the slightest degree Then he went over and smoothed
Redclouds mane and pulled a wisp of forelock from under the browband
and commanded him to shake hands which the horse did promptly

I want to shake hands wis your pony too Dorman cried and dropped
pole and fish heedlessly into the grass

All right kid

Dorman went up gravely and clasped Redclouds raised fetlock solemnly
while the tall cowpuncher smiled down at him

Kiss him Redcloud he said softly and then when the horses nose
was thrust in his face No not mekiss the kid He lifted the child
up in his arms and when Redcloud touched his soft nose to Dormans
cheek and lifted his lip for a dainty toothless nibble Dorman was
speechless with fright and rapture thrillingly combined

Now run home with your fish it lacks only two hours and forty minutes
to dinner time and it will take at least twenty minutes for the fish to
fryso you see youll have to hike

Beatrice flushed and looked at him sharply but Keith was getting into
the saddle and did not appear to remember she was there The fingers
that were tying her hatribbons under her chin fumbled awkwardly and
trembled Beatrice would have given a good deal at that moment to know
just what Keith Cameron was thinking and she was in a blind rage with
herself to think that it mattered to her what he thought

When he lifted his hat she only nodded curtly She mimicked every beast
and bird she could think of on the way home to wipe him and his horse
from the memory of Dorman whose capacity for telling things best left
untold was simply marvelous

It is saying much for Beatrices powers of entertainment that Dorman
quite forgot to say anything about Mr Cameron and his pony and
chattered to his auntie and grandmama about kitties up in a tree and
lost lambs and sleepy birds until he was tucked into bed that night
It was not until then that Beatrice felt justified in drawing a long
breath Not that she cared whether any one knew of her meeting Keith
Cameron only that her mother would instantly take alarm and preach to
her about the wickedness of flirting and Beatrice was not in the mood
for sermons



CHAPTER 9 What It Meant to Keith


Dick I wish youd tell me about this leasing business There are
points which I dont understand Beatrice leaned over and smoothed
Rexs sleek shoulder with her hand

What do you want to understand it for The thing is done now Weve got
the fenceposts strung and a crew hired to set them

You neednt snap your words like that Dick It doesnt matteronly I
was wondering why Mr Cameron acted so queer yesterday when I told him
about it

You told Keith What did he say

He didnt say anything He just looked things

Where did you see him Dick wanted to know

Well dear me I dont see that it matters where I saw him Youre
getting as inquisitive as mama If you think it concerns you why I met
him accidentally when I was fishing with Dorman He was coming to see
you but you were gone so he stopped and talked for a few minutes Was
there anything so strange about that And I told him you were leasing
the Pine Ridge country and he lookedwell peculiar But he wouldnt
say anything

Well he had good reason for looking peculiar But you neednt have
told him I did it Trix Lay that at milords door where it belongs I
dont want Keith to blame me

But why should he blame anybody It isnt his land is it

No it isnt Butyou see Trix its this way A man goes somewhere
and buys a ranchor locates on a claimand starts into the cattle
business He may not own more than a few hundred acres of land but if
he has much stock he needs miles of prairie country with water for
them to range on Its an absolute necessity you see He takes care to
locate where there is plenty of public land that is free to anybodys
cattle

Take the Pool outfit for instance We dont own land enough to feed
onethird of our cattle We depend on government land for range for
them The Cross outfit is the same only Keiths is on a smaller scale
Hes got to have range outside his own land which is mostly hay land
This part of the State is getting pretty well settled up with small
ranchers and then the sheep men keep crowding in wherever they can get
a showand sheep will starve cattle to death they leave a range as
bare as a prairiedog town So theres only one good bit of range left
around here and thats the Pine Ridge country as its called Thats
our main dependence for winter range and now when this drought has
struck us and everything is drying up weve had to turn all our cattle
down there on account of water

Ever since I took charge of the Pool Keith and I threw in together and
used the same range worked our crews together and fought the sheepmen
together There was a time when they tried to gobble the Pine Ridge
range but it didnt go Keith and I made up our minds that we needed it
worse than they didand we got it Our punchers had every sheep herder
bluffed out till there wasnt a muttonchewer could keep a bunch of
sheep on that range overnight

Now this lease law was made by stockmen for stockmen They can lease
land from the government fence itand theyve got a cinch on it as
long as the lease lasts A cow outfit can corral a heap of range that
way Theres the trick of leasing every other section or so and then
running a fence around the whole chunk and thats what the Pool has
done to the Pine Ridge But you mustnt repeat that Trix

Milord wasnt long getting on to the leasing graft in fact it turns
out the company got wind of it over in England and sent him over here
to see what could be done in that line Hes done it all right enough

And theres the Cross outfit frozen out completely The Lord only
knows what Keith will do with his cattle now for well have every drop
of water under fence inside of a month Hes in a hole for sure I
expect he feels pretty sore with me too but I couldnt help it I
explained how it was to milord butyou cant persuade an Englishman
any more than you can a

I think put in Beatrice firmly Sir Redmond did quite right It
isnt his fault that Mr Cameron owns more cattle than he can feed
If he was sent over here to lease the land it was his duty to do so
Still I really am sorry for Mr Cameron

Keith wont sit down and take his medicine if he can help it Dick
said moodily He could sell out but I dont believe he will Hes more
apt to fight

I cant see how fighting will help him Beatrice returned spiritedly

Well theres one thing retorted Dick If milord wants that fence to
stand hed better stay and watch it Ill bet money he wont more than
strike Liverpool till about forty miles more or less of Pool fence
will need repairs mighty badwhich it wont get so far as Im
concerned

Do you mean that Keith Cameron would destroy our fencing

Dick grinned Hell be a fool if he dont Trix You can tell milord
hed better send for all his traps and camp right here till that lease
runs out My punchers will have something to do beside ride fence

I shall certainly tell Sir Redmond Beatrice threatened You and
Mr Cameron hate him just because hes English You wont see what a
splendid fellow he is Its your duty to stand by him in this business
instead of taking sides with Keith Cameron Why didnt he lease that
land himself if he wanted to

Because he plays fair

Meaning I suppose that Sir Redmond doesnt I didnt think you would
be so unjust Sir Redmond is a perfect gentleman

Well youve got a chance to marry your perfect gentleman Dick
retorted savagely Its a wonder you dont take him if you think so
highly of him

I probably shall At any rate he isnt a male flirt

You dont seem to fancy a fellow that can give you as good as you
send Dick rejoined I thought you wouldnt find Keith such easy game
even if he does live on a cattle ranch You cant rope him into making a
fool of himself for your amusement and Im glad of it

Dont do your shouting too soon If you could overhear some of the
things he says you wouldnt be so sure

I suppose you take them all for their face value grinned Dick
ironically

No I dont Im not a simple country girl let me remind you Since
you are so sure of him Ill have the pleasure of saying No thank
you sir to your Keith Cameronjust to convince you I can

Oh you will Well you just tell me when you do Trix and Ill give
you your pick of all the saddle horses on the ranch

Ill take Rex and you may as well consider him mine Oh you men
A few smiles judiciously dispensed and Beatrice smiled most
exasperatingly at her brother and Dick went moody and was very poor
company the rest of the way home



CHAPTER 10 Pine Ridge Range Ablaze


At dusk that night a glow was in the southern sky and the wind carried
the pungent odor of burning grass Dick went out on the porch after
dinner and sniffed the air uneasily

I dont much like the look of it he admitted to Sir Redmond It
smells pretty strong to be across the river I sent a couple of the
boys out to look a while ago If its this side of the river well have
to get a move on

It will be the range land I take it if its on this side Sir
Redmond remarked

Just then a man thundered through the lane and up to the very steps of
the porch and when he stopped the horse he was riding leaned forward
and his legs shook with exhaustion

The Pine Ridge Range is afire Mr Lansell the man announced quietly

Dick took a long pull at his cigar and threw it away Have the boys
throw some barrels and sacks into a wagonand git He went inside and
grabbed his hat and when he turned Sir Redmond was at his elbow

Im going too Dick cried Beatrice who always seemed to hear
anything that promised excitement I never saw a prairiefire in my
life

Its ten miles off said Dick shortly taking the steps at a jump

I dont care if its twentyIm going Sir Redmond wait for me

Beatrice cried her mother detainingly but Beatrice was gone to get
ready A quick job she made of it she threw a dark skirt over her
thin white one slipped into the nearest jacket snatched her
ridinggauntlets off a chair where she had thrown them and then
couldnt find her hat That however did not trouble her Down in the
hall she appropriated one of Dicks off the hall tree and announced
herself ready Sir Redmond laughed caught her hand and they raced
together down to the stables before her mother had fully grasped the
situation

Isnt Rex saddled Dick

Dick his foot in the stirrup stopped long enough to glance over his
shoulder at her You ready so soon Jim saddle Rex for Miss Lansell
He swung up into the saddle

Arent you going to wait Dick

Cant Milord can bring you And Dick was away on the run

Men were hurrying here and there every move counting something done
While she stood there a wagon rattled out from the shadow of a haystack
with empty waterbarrels dancing a mad jig behind the high seat where
the driver perched with feet braced and a whip in his hand After him
dashed four or five riders silent and businesslike In a moment they
were mere fantastic shadows galloping up the hill through the smothery
gloom

Then came Jim leading Rex and a horse for himself Sir Redmond had
saddled his gray and was waiting Beatrice sprang into the saddle and
took the lead with nerves atingle The wind that rushed against her
face was hot and reeking with smoke Her nostrils drank greedily the
tang it carried

You gipsy cried Sir Redmond peering at her through the murky gloom

Thisis living she laughed and urged Rex faster

So they raced recklessly over the hills toward where the night was
aglow Before them the wagon pounded over untrailed prairie sod with
shadowy figures fleeing always before

Here wild cattle rushed off at either side to stop and eye them
curiously as they whirled past There a coyote squatting unseen upon
a distant pinnacle howled longdrawn and quavering his weird protest
against the solitudes in which he wandered

The dusk deepened to dark and they could no longer see the racing
shadows The rattle of the wagon came mysteriously back to them through
the black

Once Rex stumbled over a rock and came near falling but Beatrice only
laughed and urged him on unheeding Sir Redmonds call to ride slower

They splashed through a shallow creek and came upon the wagon halted
that the cowboys might fill the barrels with water Then they passed by
and when they heard them following the wagon no longer rattled glibly
along but chuckled heavily under its load

The dull red glow brightened to orange Then breasting at last a long
hill they came to the top and Beatrice caught her breath at what lay
below

A jagged line of leaping flame cut clean through the dark of the coulee
The smoke piled rosily above and before and the sullen roar of it
clutched the senseschallenging sinister Creeping stealthily
relentlessly here a thin gash of yellow hugging close to the earth
there a bold bright wall of fire it swept the coulee from rim to rim

The wind is carrying it from us Sir Redmond was saying in her ear
Are you afraid to stop here alone I ought to go down and lend a hand

Beatrice drew a long gasp Oh no Im not afraid Go there is Dick
down there

Youre sure you wont mind He hesitated dreading to leave her

No no Go onthey need you

Sir Redmond turned and rode down the ridge toward the flames His
straight figure was silhouetted sharply against the glow

Beatrice slipped off her horse and sat down upon a rock dead to
everything but the fiendish beauty of the scene spread out below her
Millions of sparks danced in and out among the smoke wreaths which
curled upwardnow black now red now a dainty rose Off to the left a
coyote yapped shrilly ending with his mournful howl

Beatrice shivered from sheer ecstasy This was a world she had never
before seena world of hot smokesodden wind of deadblack shadows
and flamebright light of roar and hoarse bellowing and sharp crackles
of calm starsprinkled sky aboveand in the distance the uncanny
howling of a coyote

Time had no reckoning there She saw men running to and fro in the
glare disappearing in a downward swirl of smoke coming to view again
in the open beyond Always their arms waved rhythmically downward
beating the ragged line of yellow with watersoaked sacks The trail
they left was a wavering smoketraced rim of sullen black where before
had been gay dancing orange light In places the smolder fanned to new
life behind them and licked greedily at the ripe grass like hungry red
tongues One of these Beatrice watched curiously It crept slyly into an
unburned hollow and the wind veering suddenly pushed it out of sight
from the fighters and sent it racing merrily to the south The main line
of fire beat doggedly up against the wind that a minute before had been
friendly and fought bravely two foes instead of one It dodged ducked
and leaped high and the men beat upon it mercilessly

But the little new flame broadened and stood on tiptoes defiantly
proud of the wide black trail that kept stretching away behind it and
Beatrice watched it fascinated by its miraculous growth It began
to crackle and send up smoke wreaths of its own with sparks dancing
through then its voice deepened and coarsened till it roared quite
like its mother around the hill

The smoke from the larger fire rolled back with the wind and Beatrice
felt her eyes sting Flakes of blackened grass and ashes rained upon
the hilltop and Rex moved uneasily and pawed at the dry sod To him a
prairiefire was not beautifulit was an enemy to run from He twitched
his reins from Beatrices heedless fingers and decamped toward home
paying no attention whatever to the command of his mistress to stop

Still Beatrice sat and watched the new fire and was glad she chanced to
be upon the south end of a sharpnosed hill so that she could see
both ways The blaze dove into a deep hollow climbed the slope beyond
leaped exultantly and bellowed its challenge And of a sudden dark
forms sprang upon it and beat it cruelly and it went black where they
struck and only thin streamers of smoke told where it had been Still
they beat and struck and struck again till the fire died ingloriously
and the hillside to the south lay dark and still as it had been at the
beginning

Beatrice wondered who had done it Then she came back to her
surroundings and realized that Rex had left her and she was alone She
shiveredthis time not in ecstasy but partly from lonelinessand
went down the hill toward where Dick and Sir Redmond and the others were
fighting steadily the larger fire unconscious of the younger new one
that had stolen away from them and was beaten to death around the hill

Once in the coulee she was compelled to take to the burnt ground which
crisped hotly under her feet and sent up a rank suffocating smell of
burned grass into her nostrils The whole country was alight and down
there the world seemed on fire At times the smoke swooped blindingly
and half strangled her Her skirts in passing swept the black ashes
from grass roots which showed red in the night

Picking her way carefully around the spots that glowed warningly
shielding her face as well as she could from the smoke she kept on
until she was close upon the fighters Dick and Sir Redmond were working
side by side the sacks they held rising and falling with the regularity
of a machine for minutes at a time A group of strange horsemen galloped
up from the way she had come followed by a wagon of waterbarrels
careering recklessly over the uneven ground The horsemen stopped just
inside the burned rim the horses sidestepping gingerly upon the hot
turf

I guess you want some help here Where shall we start in Beatrice
recognized the voice It was Keith Cameron

Sure we do Dick answered gratefully Start in any old place

Im not sure we want your help spoke the angry voice of Sir Redmond
I take it youve already done a devilish sight too much

What do you mean by that Keith demanded and then by the silence it
seemed that every one knew Beatrice caught her breath Was this one of
the ways Dick meant that Keith could fight

Climb down boys and get busy Keith called to his men after a few
breaths This is for Dick Wait a minute Pete drive the wagon ahead
there I guess wed better begin on the other end and work this way
Come ontheres too much hot air here They clattered on across the
coulee kicking hot ashes up for the wind to seize upon Beatrice went
slowly up to Dick feeling all at once very tired and out of heart with
it all

Dick she called in an anxious little voice Rex has run away from
me What shall I do

Dick straightened stiffly his hands upon his aching loins and peered
through the smoke at her

I guess the only thing to do then is to get into the wagon over
there You can drive Trix if you want to and that will give us
another man here I was just going to have some one take you home
nowthe Lord only knowsyoure liable to have to stay till morning
Rex will go home all right you neednt worry about him

He bent to the work again and she could hear the wet sack thud thud
upon the ground Other sacks and blankets went thud thud and down here
at close range the fire was not so beautiful as it had been from the
hilltop Down here the glamour was gone She climbed up to the high
wagon seat and took the reins from the man who immediately seized upon
a sack and went off to the fight She felt that she was out of touch
She was out on the prairie at night miles away from any house driving
a waterwagon for the men to put out a prairie fire She had driven a
coachingparty once on a wager but she had never driven a lumberwagon
with barrels of water before She could not think of any girl she knew
who had

It was a new experience certainly but she found no pleasure in it she
was tired and sleepy and her eyes and throat smarted cruelly with the
smoke She looked back to the hill she had just left and it seemed
a long long time since she sat upon a rock up there and watched the
little new fire grow and grow and the strange shadows spring up from
nowhere and beat it vindictively till it died

Again she wondered vaguely who had done it not Keith Cameron surely
for Sir Redmond had all but accused him openly of setting the range
afire Would he stamp out a blaze that was just reaching a size to do
mischief if left a little longer No one would have seen it for hours
probably He would undoubtedly have let it run unlessBut who else
could have set the fire Who else would want to see the Pine Ridge
country black and barren Dick said Keith Cameron would not sit down and
take his medicineperhaps Dick knew he would do this thing

As the fighters moved on across the coulee she drove the wagon to keep
pace with them Often a man would run up to the wagon climb upon a
wheel and dip a frayed gunny sack into a barrel lift it out and run
with it all dripping to the nearest point of the fire Her part was
to keep the wagon at the most convenient place She began to feel the
importance of her position and to take pride in being always at the
right spot From the calm appreciation of the picturesque side she
drifted to the keen interest of the one who battles against heavy odds
The wind had veered again and the flames rushed up the long coulee
like an express train But the path it left was growing narrower every
moment Keith Cameron was doing grand work with his crew upon the other
side and the space between them was shortening perceptibly

Beatrice found herself watching the work of the Cross men If they were
doing it for effect they certainly were acting well their part She
wondered what would happen when the two crews met and the danger was
over Would Sir Redmond call Keith Cameron to account for what he had
done If he did what would Keith say And which side would Dick take
Very likely she thought he would defend Keith Cameron and shield him
if he could

Beatrice found herself crying quietly and shivering though the air was
sultry with the fire For the life of her she could not tell why she
cried but she tried to believe it was the smoke in her eyes Perhaps it
was

The sky was growing gray when the two crews met The orange lights were
gone and Dick with a spiteful flop of the black rag which had been a
good new sack stamped out the last tiny red tongue of the fire The
men stood about in awkward silence panting with heat and weariness Sir
Redmond was ostentatiously filling his pipe Beatrice knew him by his
straight soldierly pose In the drab halflight they were all mere
black outlines of men and for the most part she could not distinguish
one from another Keith Cameron she knew instinctively by his slim
height and by the way he carried his head Unconsciously she leaned
down from the high seat and listened for what would come next

Keith seemed to be making a cigarette A match flared and lighted his
face for an instant then was pinched out and he was again only a black
shape in the halfdarkness

Well Im waiting for what youve got to say Sir Redmond His voice
cut sharply through the silence If he had known Beatrice was out there
in the wagon he would have spoken lower perhaps

I fancy I said all that is necessary just now Sir Redmond answered
calmly You know what I think From now on I shall act

And what are you going to do then Keiths voice was clear and
unperturbed as though he asked for the sake of being polite

That retorted Sir Redmond is my own affair However since the
matter concerns you rather closely I will say that when I have the
evidence I am confident I shall find I shall seek the proper channels
for retribution There are laws in this country aimed to protect
a mans property I take it I warn you that I shall not sparethe
guilty

Dick its up to you next I want to know where you stand

At your back Keith right up to the finish I know you you fight
fair

All right then I didnt think youd go back on a fellow And I tell
you straight up Sir Redmond Hayes Im not out touching matches to
range landnot if it belonged to the devil himself Ive got some
feeling for the dumb brutes that would have to suffer You can get right
to work hunting evidence and be damned Youre dead welcome to all you
can find and in this part of the country you wont be able to buy much
You know very well you deserve to get your rope crossed or you wouldnt
be on the lookout for trouble Come boys lets hit the trail So long
Dick

Beatrice watched them troop off to their horses heard them mount and
go tearing off across the burned coulee bottom toward home Dick came
slowly over to her

I expect youre good and tired sis Youve made a hand all right and
helped us a whole lot I can tell you Ill drive now and well hit the
high places

Beatrice smiled wanly Not one of her Eastern acquaintances would
have recognized Beatrice Lansell the society beauty in this
remarkablelooking young woman attired in a most haphazard fashion
with a face grimed like a chimney sweep red eyelids drooping over
tired smarting eyes and disheveled ashfilled hair topped by a
mans gray felt hat When she smiled her teeth shone dead white like a
negros

Dick regarded her critically one foot on the wheel hub Where did you
get hold of Keith Camerons hat he inquired

Beatrice snatched the hat from her head with childish petulance and
looked as if she were going to throw it viciously upon the ground If
her face had been clean Dick might have seen how the blood had rushed
into her cheeks as it was she was safe behind a mask of soot She
placed the hat back upon her head feeling privately a bit foolish

I supposed it was yours I took it off the halltree The dignity of
her tone was superb but unfortunately it did not match her appearance
of rakish vagabondage

Dick grinned through a deep layer of soot Well it happens to be
Keiths He lost it in the wind the other day and I found it and took
it home Its too bad youve worn his hat all night and didnt know it
You ought to see yourself Your own mother wont know you Trix

I cant look any worse than you do A negro would be white by
comparison Do get in so we can start Im tired to death and
halfstarved After these unamiable remarks she refused to open her
lips

They drove silently in the gray of early morning and the empty barrels
danced monotonously their fantastic jig in the back of the wagon
Sootyfaced cowboys galloped wearily over the prairie before them and
Sir Redmond rode moodily alongside

Of a truth the glamour was gone



CHAPTER 11 Sir Redmond Waits His Answer


Beatrice felt distinctly out of sorts the next day and chose an hour
for her ride when she felt reasonably secure from unwelcome company But
when she went out into the sunshine there was Sir Redmond waiting with
Rex and his big gray Beatrice was not exactly elated at the sight but
she saw nothing to do but smile and make the best of it She wanted
to be alone so that she could dream along through the hills she had
learned to love and think out some things which troubled her and
decide just how she had best go about winning Rex for herself it had
become quite necessary to her peace of mind that she should teach Dick
and Keith Cameron a muchneeded lesson

It has been so long since we rode together he apologized I hope you
dont mind my coming along

Oh no Why should I mind Beatrice smiled upon him in friendly
fashion She liked Sir Redmond very muchonly she hoped he was
not going to make love Somehow she did not feel in the mood for
lovemaking just then

I dont know why Im sure But you seem rather fond of riding about
these hills by yourself One should never ask why women do things I
fancy It seems always to invite disaster

Does it Beatrice was not halflistening They were passing just
then the suburbs of a dog town and she was never tired of watching
the prairiedogs stand upon their burrows chipchip defiance until fear
overtook their impertinence and then dive headlong deep into the earth
I do think a prairiedog is the most impudent creature alive and the
most shrewish I never pass but I am scolded by these little scoundrels
till my ears burn What do you think they say

Theyre probably inviting you to stop with them and be their queen and
are scolding because your heart is hard and you only laugh and ride on

Queen of a prairiedog town Dear me Why this plaintive mood

Am I plaintive I do not mean to be Im sure

You dont appear exactly hilarious she told him I cant see what is
getting the matter with us all Mama and your sister are poor company
even for each other and Dick is like a bear One cant get a civil word
out of him Im not exactly amiable myself either but I relied upon
you to keep the mental temperature up to normal Sir Redmond

Perhaps its a good thing we shall not stop here much longer I must
confess I dont fancy the countryand Mary is downright homesick She
wants to get back to her parish affairs shes afraid some rheumatic old
woman needs coddling with jelly and wine and that sort of thing Ive
promised to hurry through the business here and take her home But I
mean to see that Pine Ridge fence in place before I go or at least
see it well under way

Im sure Dick will attend to it properly Beatrice remarked with pink
cheeks If she remembered what she had threatened to tell Sir Redmond
she certainly could not have asked for a better opportunity She was
reminding herself at that moment that she always detested a tale bearer

Your brother Dick is a fine fellow and I have every confidence in
him but you must see yourself that he is swayed more or less by
his friendship forhis neighbors It is only a kindness to take the
responsibility off his shoulders till the thing is done Im sure he
will feel better to have it so

Yes she agreed I think youre right Dick always was very
softhearted and right or wrong he clings to his friends
Then rather hastily as though anxious to change the trend of the
conversation Of course your sister will insist on keeping Dorman with
her I shall miss that little scamp dreadfully Im afraid The next
minute she saw that she had only opened a subject she dreaded even more

It is something to know that there is even one of us that you will
miss Sir Redmond observed Something in his tone hurt

I shall miss you all she said hastily It has been a delightful
summer

I wish I might know just what element made it delightful I wish

I scarcely think it has been any particular element she broke in
trying desperately to stave off what she felt in his tone I love the
wild where I can ride and ride and never meet a human beingwhere
I can dream and dally and feast my eyes on a landscape man has not
touched I have lived most of my life in New York and I love nature
so well that Im inclined to be jealous of her I want her left free to
work out all her whims in her own way She has a keen sense of humor I
think The way she modeled some of these hills proves that she loves
her little jokes I have seen where she cut deep fearsome gashes with
sides precipitous as though she had some priceless treasure hidden away
in the deep where man cannot despoil it And if you plot and plan
and try very hard you may reach the bottom at last and find the
treasurenothing Or perhaps a tiny little stream as jealously
guarded as though each drop were priceless

Sir Richmond rode for a few minutes in silence When he spoke it was
abruptly

And is that all Is there nothing to this delightful summer after all
but your hills

Oh of course Iit has all been delightful I shall hate to go back
home I think Beatrice was a bit startled to find just how much she
would hate to go back and wrap herself once more in the conventions of
society life For the first time since she could remember she wanted
her world to stand still

Sir Redmond went doggedly to the point he had in mind and heart

I hoped Beatrice you would count me too Ive tried to be patient
You know dont you that I love you

Youve certainly told me often enough she retorted in a miserable
attempt at her old manner

And youve put me off and laughed at me and did everything under
heaven but answer me fairly And Ive acted the fool no doubt I know
it Ive no courage before a woman A curl of your lip and I was ready
to cut and run But I cant go on this way foreverIve got to know
I wish I could talk as easy as I can fight Id have settled the thing
long ago Where other men can plead their cause I can say just the one
thingI love you Beatrice When I saw you first in the carriage I
loved you then You had some furbrown fursnuggled under your chin
and the pink of your cheeks and your dear brown eyes shining and
smiling aboveGood God Ive always loved you From the beginning of
the world I think Id be good to you Beatrice and I believe I could
make you happyif you give me the chance

Something in Beatrices throat ached cruelly It was the truth and she
knew it He did love her and the love of a brave man is not a thing
to be thrust lightly aside But it demanded such a lot in return
More perhaps than she could give A love like thata love that gives
everythingdemands everything in return Anything less insults it

She stole a glance at him Sir Redmond was looking straight before him
with the fixed gaze that sees nothing There was the white line around
his mouth which Beatrice had seen once before Again that griping ache
was in her throat till she could have cried out with the pain of it
She wanted to speak to say somethinganythingwhich would drive that
look from his face

While her mind groped among the jumble of words that danced upon her
tongue and that seemed all of them so pitifully weak and inadequate
she heard the galloping hoofs of a horse pounding close behind A
choking cloud of dust swept down upon them and Keith riding in the
midst reined out to pass He lifted his hat His eyes challenged
Beatrice swept coldly the face of her companion and turned again to
the trail He swung his heels backward and Redcloud broke again into
the tireless lope that carried him far ahead until there was only a
brown dot speeding over the prairie

Sir Redmond waited until Keith was far beyond hearing then he filled
his lungs deeply and looked at Beatrice Dont you feel you could trust
meand love me a little

Beatrice was deadly afraid she was going to cry and she hated weeping
women above all things A little wouldnt do she said with what
firmness she could muster I should want to love you as muchquite as
much as you deserve Sir Redmond or not at all Im afraid I cant I
wish I could though II think I should like to love you but perhaps
I havent much heart I like you very muchbetter than I ever liked
any one before but oh I wish you wouldnt insist on an answer I dont
know myself how I feel I wish you had not asked meyet I tried not
to let you

A man can keep his heart still for a certain time Beatrice but not
for always Some time he will say what his heart commands if the
chance is given him the woman cant hold him back I did wait and wait
because I thought you werent ready for me to speak Andyou dont care
for anybody else

Of course I dont But I hate to give up my freedom to any one Sir
Redmond I want to be freefree as the wind that blows here always
and changes and changes and blows from any point that suits its whim
without being bound to any rule

Do you think Im an ogre that will lock you in a dungeon Beatrice
Cant you see that I am not threatening your freedom I only want the
right to love you and make you happy I should not ask you to go or
stay where you did not please and Id be good to you Beatrice

I dont think it would matter cried Beatrice if you werent I
should love you because I couldnt help myself I hate doing things by
rule I tell you I couldnt care for you because you were good to me
and I ought to care it must be because I cant help myself And I
She stopped and shut her teeth hard together she felt sure she should
cry in another minute if this went on

I believe you do love me Beatrice and your rebellious young American
nature dreads surrender He tried to look into her eyes and smile
but she kept her eyes looking straight ahead Then Sir Redmond made
the biggest blunder of his life out of the goodness of his heart and
because he hated to tease her into promising anything

I wont ask you to tell me now Beatrice he said gently I want you
to be sure I never could forgive myself if you ever felt you had made a
mistake A week from tonight I shall ask you once moreand it will be
for the last time After thatBut I wont thinkI darent think what
it would be like if you say no Will you tell me then Beatrice

The heart of Beatrice jumped into her throat At that minute she was
very near to saying yes and having done with it She was quite sure she
knew then what her answer would be in a week The smile she gave him
started Sir Redmonds blood to racing exultantly Her lips parted a
little as if a word were there ready to be spoken but she caught
herself back from the decision Sir Redmond had voluntarily given her a
week well then she would take it to the last minute

Yes Ill tell you a week from tonight after dinner Ill race you
home Sir Redmondthe first one through the big gate by the stable
wins She struck Rex a blow that made him jump and darted off down
the trail that led home and her teasing laugh was the last Sir Redmond
heard of her that day for she whipped into a narrow gulch when the
first turn hid her from him and waited until he had thundered by After
that she rode complacently deep into the hills wickedly pleased at the
trick she had played him

Every day during the week that followed she slipped away from him and
rode away by herself resolved to enjoy her freedom to the full while
she had it for after that she felt things would never be quite the
same

Every day when Dick had chance for a quiet word with her he wanted
to know who owned Rextill at last she lost her temper and told him
plainly that in her opinion Keith Cameron had left the country for
two reasons instead of one For Keith be it known had not been seen
since the day he passed her and Sir Redmond on the trail Beatrice
averred that she had a poor opinion of a man who would not stay and face
whatever was coming

There was just one day left in her week of freedom and Dick still owned
Rex with the chances all in his favor for continuing to do so Still
Beatrice was vindictively determined upon one point Let Keith Cameron
cross her path and she would do something she had never done before
she would deliberately lead him on to proposeif the fellow had nerve
enough to do so which she told Dick she doubted




CHAPTER 12 Held Up by Mr Kelly


Traveler what lies over the hill questioned a mischievous voice

Keith dreaming along a winding rockstrewn trail in the canyon looked
up quickly and beheld his Hearts Desire sitting calmly upon her horse
ten feet before Redclouds nose watching him amusedly Redcloud must
have been dreaming also or he would have whinnied warning and welcome
with the same breath

Traveler tell to me she went on seeing Keith only stared

Keith not to be outdone searched his memory hurriedly for the reply
which should rightly follow secretly he was amazed at her sudden
friendliness

Child theres a valley over therebut it isnt pretty and wooded
and shynot what you can notice And there isnt any little town
either unless you go a long way Why Keith rested his gloved hands
one above the other on the saddle horn and let his eyes riot with the
love that was in him He had not seen his Hearts Desire for a week A
week It seemed a thousand years And here she was before him unusually
gracious

Why I discovered that hill two hours ago it seems to me and it
wasnt more than a mile off I want to see what lies on the other side
I feel sure no man ever stood upon the top and looked down It is my
hillmine by the right of discovery But Ive been going and going
and I think its rather farther away if anything than it was before

Good thing I met you Keith declared and he looked as if he meant it
Youre probably lost right now and dont know it Which way is home

Beatrice smiled a superior smile and pointed

I thought so grinned Keith joyously Youre pointing straight toward
Claggett

It doesnt matter said Beatrice since you know and youre here
The important thing is to get to the top of that hill

What for Keith questioned

Why to be there Beatrice opened her big eyes at him That she
declared whimsically is the top of the world and it is mine I found
it I want to go up there and look down

Its an unmerciful climb Keith demurred hypocritically to strengthen
her resolution

All the better I dont value what comes easily

You wont see anything except more hills

I love hillsand more hills

Youre a long way from home and its after one oclock

I have a lunch with me and I often stay out until dinner time

Keith gave a sigh that shook the saddle making up in volume what
it lacked in sincerity The blood in him was ajump at the prospect of
leading his Hearts Desire up next the cloudsup where the world was
yet young A man in love is fond of selftorture

I have not said you must go Beatrice answered with the sigh

You dont have to he retorted It is a self evident fact Who wants
to go prowling around these hills by night with a lantern that smokes
an has an evil smell losing sleep and yowling like a bunch of coyotes
hunting a misguided young woman who thinks north is south and cant
point straight up

You draw a flattering picture Mr Cameron

Its realistic Do you still insist upon getting up there for the
doubtful pleasure of looking down Secretly he hoped so

Certainly

Then I shall go with you

You need not I can go very well by myself Mr Cameron

Beatrice was something of a hypocrite herself

I shall go where duty points the way

I hope it points toward home then

It doesnt though It takes the trail you take

I never yet allowed my wishes to masquerade as Disagreeable Duty with
two big Ds she told him tartly and started off

Say If youre going up that hill this is the trail Youll bump up
against a straight cliff if you follow that path

Beatrice turned with seeming reluctance and allowed him to guide her
just as she had intended he should do

Dick tells me you have been away she began suavely

Yes Ive just got back from Fort Belknap he explained quietly
though he must have known his absence had been construed differently
Ive rented pasturage on the reservation for every hoof I own Great
grass over therethe whole prairie like a hay meadow almost and
little streams everywhere

You are very fortunate Beatrice remarked politely

Luck ought to come my way once in a while I dont seem to get more
than my share though

Dick will be glad to know you have a good range for your cattle Mr
Cameron

I expect he will You may tell him for me that Jim Worthingtonhes
the agent over there and was in college with ussays I can have my
cattle there as long as hes running the place

Why not tell him yourself Beatrice asked

I dont expect to be over to the Pool ranch for a while Keiths tone
was significant and Beatrice dropped the subject

Been fishing lately he asked easily as though he had not left her
that day in a miff No Dorman is fickle like all male creatures
Dick brought him two little brown puppies the other day and now he can
hardly be dragged from the woodshed to his meals I believe he would eat
and sleep with them if his auntie would allow him to

The trail narrowed there and they were obliged to ride single file
which was not favorable to conversation Thus far Beatrice thought she
was a long way from winning her wager but she did not worryshe looked
up to where the hill towered above them and smiled

Well have to get off and lead our horses over this spur he told her
at last Once on the other side we can begin to climb Still in the
humor to tackle it

To be sure I am After all this trouble I shall not turn back

All right said Keith inwardly shouting If his Hearts Desire wished
to take a climb that would last a good two hours he was not there to
object He led her up a steep rockstrewn ridge and into a hollow From
there the hill sloped smoothly upward

Ill just anchor these cayuses to a rock to make deadsure of them
Keith remarked It wouldnt be fun to be set afoot out here now would
it How would you like the job of walking home eh

I dont think Id enjoy it much Beatrice said showing her one dimple
conspicuously Id rather ride

Throw up your hands growled a voice from somewhere

Keith wheeled toward the sound and a bullet spatted into the yellow
clay two inches from the toe of his boot Also a rifle cracked
sharply He took the hint and put his hands immediately on a level with
his hat crown

No use he called out ruefully I havent anything to return the
compliment with

Well Ive got t have the papers fur that mister retorted the
voice and a man appeared from the shelter of a rock and came slowly
down to thema man longlegged and lank with haggard unshaven face
and eyes that had hunger and dogged endurance looking out He picked his
way carefully with his feet his eyes and the rifle fixed unswervingly
at the two Beatrice was too astonished to make a sound

What sort of a holdup do you call this demanded Keith hotly his
hands itching to be down and busy We dont carry rolls of money around
in the hills you fool

Oh damn your money the man said roughly Ive got money t burn
I want t trade horses with yuh That roan there looks like a stayer
Ill take him

Well seeing you seem to be head push here I guess its a trade
Keith answered But Ill thank you for my own saddle

Beatrice whose hands were up beside her ears and not an inch higher
changed from amazed curiosity to concern Oh you mustnt take Redcloud
away from Mr Cameron she protested You dont knowhes so fond
of that horse You may take mine hes a good horsehes a perfectly
splendid horse but IIm not so attached to him

The fellow stopped and looked at hernot however forgetting Keith
who was growing restive Beatrices cheeks were very pink and her eyes
were bright and big and earnest He could not look into them without
letting some of the sternness drop out of his own

I wish youd please take RexId rather trade than not she coaxed
When Beatrice coaxed mere man must yield or run The fellow was but
human and he was not in a position to run so he grinned and wavered

Its fair to say youll get done he remarked his eyes upon the
odd little dimple at the corner of her mouth as if he had never seen
anything quite so fetching

Your horse wont crbuck will he she ventured doubtfully This was
her first horse trade and it behooved her to be cautious even at the
point of a rifle

Well no said the man laconically he wont Hes dead

Oh Beatrice gasped and blushed She might have known she thought
that the fellow would not take all this trouble if his horse was in a
condition to buck Then My elbows hurt II think I should like to
sit down

Sure said the man politely Make yourself comfortable I aint used
t dealin with ladies But you got t set still yuh know and not try
any tricks I can put up a mighty swift gun play when I need toand
your bein a lady wouldnt cut no ice in a case uh that kind

Thank you Beatrice sat down upon the nearest rock folded her hands
meekly and looked from him to Keith who seethed to claim a good deal of
the mans attention She observed that at a long breath from Keith his
captor was instantly alert

Maybe your elbows ache too he remarked dryly Theyll git over it
though Ive knowed a man t grab at the clouds upwards of an hour an
no harm done

Thats encouraging Im sure Keith shifted to the other foot

Hows that sorrel demanded the man Can he go

Keith hesitated a second

Indeed he can go put in Beatrice eagerly Hes every bit as good as
Redcloud

Is that sorrel yours The mans eyes shifted briefly to her face

Noo Beatrice thinking how she had meant to own him blushed

That accounts for it He laughed unpleasantly I wondered why you was
so dead anxious t have me take him

The eyes of Beatrice snapped sparks at him but her manner was demure
not to say meek He belongs to my brother she explained and my
brother has dozens of good saddlehorses Mr Camerons horse is a pet
Its different when a horse follows you all over the place and fairly
talks to you Hell shake hands and

Uhhuh I see the point I guess What dyuh say kid

Keith might seem boyish but he did not enjoy being addressed as kid
He was twentyeight years old whether he looked it or not

I say this If you take my horse Ill kill you Ill have twentyfive
cowpunchers camping on your trail before sundown If you take this
girls horse Ill do the same

The man shut his lips in a thin line

No he wont cried Beatrice leaning forward Dont mind a thing he
says You cant expect a man to keep his temper with his hands up in the
air like that You take Rex and Ill promise for Mr Cameron

TrixMiss Lansellsternly

I promise you he wont do a thing she went on firmly Hehe isnt
half as fierce really asas he looks

Keiths face got red

The man laughed a little Evidently the situation amused him whether
the others could see the humor of it or not So Im to have your
cayuse eh

Keith saw two big tears tipping over her lower lids and gritted his
teeth

Well it aint often I git a chance t please a lady the fellow
decided I guess Rexll do all right Go over and change saddles
youngsterand dont git gay Ive got the drop and yuh notice Im
keeping it

Are you going to take his saddle Beatrice stood up and clenched her
hands looking very much as if she would like to pull his hair Keith in
trouble appealed to her strangely

Sure thing Its a peach from the look of it Mines over the hill a
piece Step along there kid I want t be movin

Youll need to go some flared Keith over his shoulder

I expect t go some retorted the man A fellow with three sheriffs
posses campin on his trail aint apt t loiter none

Oh Beatrice sat down and stared Then you must be

Yep the fellow laughed recklessly You ca tell your maw yuh met up
with Kelly the darin trainrobber I wouldnt be sprised if she close
herded yuh fer a spell till her scare wears off Bu Ive hung around
these parts long enough I fooled them sheriffs aplenty stayin here
Gee your swiftI dont think This last sentence was directed at
Keith who was putting a snail to shame and making it appear he was in
a hurry

Git a move on commanded Kelly threatening with his eyes

Keith wisely made no replynor did he show any symptoms of haste
despite the menacing tone Slowly he pulled his saddle off Redcloud
and carefully he placed it upon the ground When a fellow lives in
his saddle almost he comes to think a great deal of it and he is
reluctant under any circumstances to surrender it to another to have
a man deliberately confiscate it with the authority which lies in a lump
of lead the size of a child thumb is not pleasant

Through Keiths brain flashed a dozen impracticable plans and one that
offered a slendervery slenderchance of success If he could get
a little closer He moved over beside Rex an unbuckling the cinch of
Beatrices saddle pulled it sullenly off

Now put your saddle on that there Rex horse and cinch it tight

Keith picked up the saddlehis saddle and threw it across Rexs back
raging inwardly at his helplessness To lose his saddle worse to let
Beatrice lose her horse Lord a pretty figure he must cut in her eyes

Dry weather were havin Kelly remarked politely to Beatrice
without however looking in her direction Prairie fires are gittin
t be the regular thing I notice

Beatrice studied his face and found no ulterior purpose for the words

Yes she agreed as pleasantly as she could in view of the
disquieting circumstances I helped fight a prairiefire last week over
this way We were out all night

Prairiefires is mean things t handle oncet they git started I
always hate t see em git hold of the grass What fire was that you
mention

Beatrice glanced toward Keith and was thankful his back was turned to
her But a quick suspicion had come to her and she went steadily on
with the subject

It was the Pine Ridge country It started very mysteriously

It wasnt no mystery t me Kelly laughed grimly I started that
there blaze myself accidentally I throwed a cigarette down thinkin
it had gone out After a while I seen a blaze where Id jest left but
I didnt have no license t go back an put it outmy orders was to git
out uh that I seen the sky all lit up that night Kid are yuh goin t
sleep

Keith started He had been listening and thanking his lucky star that
Beatrice was listening also If she had suspected him of setting the
range afire she knew better now A weight lifted off Keiths shoulders
and he stood a bit straighter those chance words meant a great deal
to him and he felt that he would not grudge his saddle in payment But
Rexthat was another matter Beatrice should not lose him if he could
prevent it still what could he do

He might turn and spring upon Kelly but in the meantime Kelly would
not be idle he would probably be pumping bullets out of the rifle into
Keiths bodyand he would still have the horse He stole a glance at
Beatrice and went hot all over at what he thought he read in her eyes
For once he was not glad to be near his Hearts Desire he wished her
elsewhereanywhere but sitting on that rock over there with her
little gloved hands folded quietly in her lap and that adorable
demure look on her facethe look which would have put her mother
instantly upon the defensiveand a gleam in her eyes Keith read for
scorn

Surely he might do something Barely six feet now separated him from
Kelly If one of those lumps of rock that strewed the ground was in
his handhe stooped to reach under Rexs body for the cinch and could
almost feel Kellys eyes boring into his back A false movewell Keith
had heard of Kelly a good many times if this fellow was really the
man he claimed to be Keith did not need to guess what would follow a
suspicious move he knew He looked stealthily toward him and Kellys
eyes met his with a gleam sinister

Kelly grinned I wouldnt kid he said softly

Keith swore in a whisper and his fingers closed upon the cinch It was
no use to fight the devil with cunning he thought bitterly

Just then Beatrice gave an unearthly screech that made the horses
knees bend under them When Keith whirled to see what it was she was
standing upon the rock with her skirts held tightly around her like
the pictures of women when a mouse gets into the room

Oh Mr Cameron A snaake

Came a metallic brrr the unmistakable war cry of the rattler Into
Kellys eyes came a look of fear and he sidled gingerly The buzz had
sounded unpleasantly close to his heels For one brief instant the cold
eye of his rifle regarded harmlessly the hillside During that instant a
goodly piece of sandstone whinged under his jaw and he went down with
Keith upon him like a mountain lion The latter snatched the rifle
and got up hurriedly for he had not forgotten the rattler Kelly lay
looking up at him in a dazed way that might have been funny at any other
time

I wondered if you were good at grasping opportunities said Beatrice
When he looked there she was sitting down on the rock with her
little gloved hands folded in her lap and that adorable demure look on
her face and a gleam in her eyes he knew was not scorn though he could
not rightly tell what it really did mean

Keith wondered at her vaguely but a man cant have his mind on a dozen
things at once It was important that he keep a sharp watch on Kelly
and his eyes were searching for a gleaming gray spotted coil which he
felt to be near

You neednt look Mr Cameron There isnt any snake Itit was I

You Keiths jaw dropped

Look out Mr Cameron It wouldnt work a second time Im afraid

Keith turned back before Kelly had more than got to his elbow plainly
Kelly was not feeling well just then He looked unhappy and rather
sick

If youll hand me the gun Mr Cameron I think I can hold it steady
while you fix the saddles And then well go home II dont think I
really care to climb the hill

What Keith wanted to do was to take her in his arms and kiss her till
he was tired What he did do was back toward her and let her take the
rifle quickly and deftly from his hands She rested the gun upon
her knee and brought it to bear upon Mr Kelly with a composure not
assuring to that gentleman and she tried to look as if she really and
truly would shoot a manand managed to look only the more kissable

Dont squirm Mr Kelly I wont bite if I do buzz sometimes

Kelly stared at her meditatively a minute and said Well Ill be
damned

Keith looked at her also but he did not say anything

The way he slapped his saddle back upon Redcloud and cinched it and
saddled Rex was a pretty exhibition of precision and speed learned in
roundup camps Kelly watched him grimly

I knowed you wasnt as swift as yuh knew how t be a while back
he commented Ive got this t say fur you two Youre a little the
toughest proposition I ever run up aginstand Ive been up aginst it
good and plenty

Thanks Keith said cheerfully Youd better take Rex now and go
ahead Miss Lansell Ill take that gun and look after this fellow Get
up Kelly

What are you going to do with him

Kelly got unsteadily upon his feet Beatrice looked at him and then at
Keith She asked a question

March him home and send him in to the nearest sheriff Keith was
businesslike and his tone was crisp

Beatrices eyes turned again to Kelly He did not whine or beg or
even curse He stood looking straight before him at something only his
memory could see and in his face was weariness and a deep loneliness
and a certain grim despair There was an ugly bruise where the rock had
struck but the rest of his face was drawn and white

If you do that cried Beatrice in a voice hardly more than a fierce
whisper I shall hate you always You are not a manhunter Let him
stay here and take his chance in the hills

Keith was not a hard man to persuade into being merciful Its easy
enough to say yes Miss Lansell I always was chickenhearted when a
fellow seemed down on his luck You can stay here KellyI dont want
you anyway He laughed boyishly and irresponsibly for he felt that
Kelly had done him a service that day

Beatrice flashed him a smile that went to his head and made him dizzy
and took up Rexs bridle rein She hesitated looked doubtfully at
Kelly who stood waiting stoically and turned to her saddle She untied
a bundle and went quickly over to him

YouI dont want my lunch after all Im going home now II want
you to take it please There are some sandwicheswith veal loaf that
Looey Sam makes deliciouslyand some cake II wish it was more I
know youll like the veal loaf

Kelly looked down at her and God knows what thoughts were in his mind
He did not answer her with words he just swallowed hard

Poor devil was what Keith said to himself and the gun he was holding
threatened for a minute to wing a cloud

Beatrice laid the package in Kellys unresisting hand looked up into
his averted face and said simply Goodby Mr Kelly

After that she hurried Rex up the steep ridge much faster than she
had gone down it endangering his bones and putting herself very empty
lunged

At the top of the ridge Keith stopped and looked down

Hi Kelly

Kelly showed that he heard

Heres your gun on this rock You can come up and get it if you want
to Andsay Ive got a few broke horses ranging down here somewhere
VN brand on left shoulder I wont scour the hills very bad if I
should happen to miss a cayuse So long

Kelly waved his hand for farewell



CHAPTER 13 Keiths Masterful Wooing


Keith faced toward home with Redcloud following at his heels like a pet
dog For some reason which he did not try to analyze he was feeling
light of heartas though something very nice had happened to him
It might have been the unexpected clearing up of the mystery of the
prairiefire though he was not dwelling particularly upon that He
was thinking a great deal more of Beatrices bluebrown eyes which had
never been more baffling so far as he knew And his blood was still
dancing with the smile she had given him it hardly seemed possible that
a girl could smile just like that and not mean anything

When he reached the level where she was waiting for him he saw that
she had her arms around the neck of her horse and that she was crying
dismally heartbrokenly with an abandon that took no thought of his
presence Keith had never seen a girl cry like that before He had
seen them dab at their eyes with their handkerchief and smile the next
breathbut this was different For a minute he didnt quite know what
to do he could hear the blood hammering against his temples while he
stood dumbly watching her He went hesitatingly up and laid a gloved
hand deprecatingly upon her shoulder

Dont do that Miss Lansell The fellow isnt worth it Hes only
living the life he chose for himself and he doesnt mind not half
as much as you imagine I know how you feelI felt sorry for him
myselfbut he doesnt deserve it you know He stopped not being
able just at the moment to think of anything more to say about Kelly
Beatrice who had not been thinking of Kelly at all but remorsefully of
a fellow she had persisted in misjudging only cried the harder

Dontdont cry like that IMiss LansellTrixdarling Keiths
selfcontrol snapped suddenly like a rope when the strain becomes too
great He caught her fiercely in his arms and crushed her close against
him

Beatrice stopped crying and gasped

Trixie if you must cry I wish youd cry for me Im about as
miserable a manI want you so God made you for me and Im starving
for the feel of your lips on mine Then Keith who was nothing if not
daring once he was roused bent and kissed her without waiting to see
if he mightand not only once but several times

Beatrice made a halfhearted attempt to get free of his arms but Keith
was not a foolhe held her closer and laughed from pure primitive
joy

Mr Cameron It was Beatrices voice but it had never been like that
before

I think you might call me Keith he cut in Youve got to begin some
time and now is as good a time as any

Youyoure taking a good deal for granted she said wriggling
unavailingly in his arms

A mans got to with a girl like you Youre so used to turning a
fellow down I believe youd do it just from habit

Indeed She was trying to be sarcastic and got kissed for her pains

Yes indeed He mimicked her tone I want you I want you I wanted
you long before I ever saw you And so Im not taking any chancesI
didnt dare you see I just had to take you first and ask you
afterward

Beatrice laughed a little with tears very close to her lashes and
gave up What was the use of trying to resist this masterful fellow who
would not even give her a chance to refuse him She did not know quite
how to say no to a man who did not ask her to say yes But the queer
part to her was the feeling that she would have hated to say no
anyway It never occurred to her till afterward that she might
have stood upon a pedestal of offended dignity and cried Unhand me
villainand that if she had Keith would undoubtedly have complied
instantly As it was she just laughed softly and blushed a good deal

I believe mama is right about you after all she said wickedly At
heart youre a bold highwayman

Maybe I know Id not stand and see some other fellow walk off with my
Hearts Desire without putting up a fight It did look pretty blue
for me though and I was afraidbut its all right now isnt it
Possession is nine points in law they say and Ive got you now Im
going to keep you too When are you going to come over and take charge
of the Cross ranch

Dear me said Beatrice snuggling against his shoulder and finding
it the best place in the world to be I never said I was going to take
charge at all Then the impulse of confession seized her Will you
hate me if I tell you something

I expect I will Keith assented his eyes positively idolatrous What
is it girlie

Well Iit was Dicks fault I never would have thought of such a
thing if he hadnt goaded me into itbutwell I was going to make
you propose on a wager The brown head of Beatrice went down out of
sight on his arm I was going to refuse youand get Rex

I know Keith held her closer than ever Dick rode over and told me
that day And I wasnt going to give you a chance missy If you hadnt
started to cry here Oh whats the use You didnt refuse meand
youre not going to either are you girlie

Beatrice intimated that there was no immediate danger of such a thing
happening

You see Dick and I felt that you belonged to me by rights I fell in
love with a picture of you that you sent himthat one taken in your
graduation gownand I told Dick I was going to take the next train
East and carry you off by force if I couldnt get you any other way
But Dick thought Id stand a better show to wait till hed coaxed you
out here We had it all fixed that youd come and find a prairie knight
that was ready to fight for you and hed make you like him whether
you wanted to or not and then hed keep you here and wed all be happy
ever after And Dick would pull out of the Northern Pooland of course
you wouldand wed have a company of our own Oh we had some great
castles built out here on the prairie let me tell you And then when
you finally came here you had milord tagging alongand you thinking
you were in love with him Maybe you think I wasnt shaky girlie The
air castles got awfully wobbly and it looked like they were going to
cave in on us But I was bound to stay in the game if I could and Dick
did all he could to get you to looking my wayand its all right isnt
it Trixie Keith kept recurring to the ecstatic realization that it
was all right

Beatrice meditated for a minute

I never dreamedDick never even mentioned you in any of his letters
she said in a rather dazed tone And when I came he made me believe
you were a horrible flirt and I never can resist the temptation to
measure lances

And take a fall out of a male flirt Keith supplemented Dick he
went on sententiously and slangily was dead onto his job After that
he helped her into the saddle and they rode blissfully homeward

Near the ranch they met Dick who pulled up and eyed them anxiously at
first and then with a broad smile

Say Trix he queried slyly who does Rex belong to

Keith came to the rescue promptly just as a brave knight should You
he retorted But I tell you right now he wont very long Youre going
to do the decent thing and give him to Trixiefor a wedding present

Dick looked as though Trix was welcome to any thing he possessed



CHAPTER 14 Sir Redmond Gets His answer


Before long dear we shall get on the great ship and ride across the
large large ocean and be at home You will be delighted to see Peggy
and Rupert and the dogs wont you dear Miss Hayes her cheeks
actually getting some color into them at the thought of going home
buttered a fluffy biscuit for her idol

Dorman took two bites while he considered Rupertll want my little
wheels for my feet what Mr Camron gave mebut he cant have em
dough I spect hell be mad I wonder whatll Peggy say bout my two
puppies Ive got to take my two puppies wis me Will dey get sick
riding on de water auntie Say will dey

II think not dear ventured his auntie cautiously His auntie was a
conscientious woman and she knew very little about puppies

Betrice will help me take care of dem if deyre sick he remarked
comfortably

Then something in his divinitys face startled his assurance Yous
going wis us isnt you Betrice I want you to help take care of my
two puppies Martha cant cause she slaps dere ears Is you going wis
us Betrice

This at the dinner table was to say the least
embarrassingespecially on this especial evening when Beatrice was
trying to muster courage to give Sir Redmond the only answer it was
possible to give him now It was an open secret that in case she had
accepted him the homegoing of Miss Hayes would be delayed a bit when
they would all go together Beatrice had overheard her mother and Miss
Hayes discussing this possibility only the day before She undertook the
impossible and attempted to head Dorman off

Perhaps youll see a whale honey The puppies never saw a whale Im
sure What do you suppose theyd think

Is you going

Youd have to hold them up high you know so they could see and show
them just where to look and

Is you going Betrice

Beatrice sent a quick despairing glance around the table Four pairs of
eyes were fixed upon her with varying degrees of interest and anxiety
The fifth pairDickswere trying to hide their unrighteous glee by
glaring down at the chicken wing on his plate Beatrice felt a strong
impulse to throw something at him She gulped and faced the inevitable
It must come some time she thought and it might as well be nowthough
it did seem a pity to spoil a good dinner for every one but Dick who
was eating his with relish

No honeyher voice was clear and had the note of finalityIm not
goingever

Sir Redmonds teeth went together with a click and he picked up the
pepper shaker mechanically and peppered his salad until it was perfectly
black and Beatrice wondered how he ever expected to eat it Mrs
Lansell dropped her fork on the floor and had to have a clean one
brought Miss Hayes sent a frightened glance at her brother Dick sat
and ate fried chicken

Why Betrice I wants you toand de puppiesll need youand auntie
and Dorman gathered himself for the last crushing argumentand
Uncle Redmon wants you awflly

Beatrice took a sip of ice water for she needed it

Why Betrice Granmamall let you go guess Cant she go
granmama

It was Mrs Lansells turn to test the exquisite torture of that prickly
chill along the spine Like Beatrice she dodged

Little boys she announced weakly should not speak until theyre
spoken to

Dick came near strangling on a shred of chicken

Cant she go granmama Say cant she Tell Betrice to go home wis
us granmama

BeatriceMrs Lansell swallowedis not a little child any longer
Dorman She is a woman and can do as she likes Ishe was speaking to
the whole groupI can only advise her

Dorman gave a squeal of triumph See You can go Betrice Granmama
says you can go You will go wont you Betrice Say yes

No said Beatrice with desperate emphasis I wont

I wantBetriceto goo Dorman slid down upon his shoulder blades
gave a squeal which was not triumph but temper and kicked the table
till every dish on it danced

Dorman sit up commanded his auntie Dorman stop this instant Im
ashamed of you where is my good little man Redmond

Sir Redmond seemed glad of the chance to do something besides sit
quietly in his place and look calm He got up deliberately and in two
minutes or less Dorman was in the woodshed with him making sounds
that frightened his puppies dreadfully and put the coyotes to shame

Beatrice left the table hurriedly to escape the angry eyes of her
mother The sounds in the woodshed had died to a subdued sniffling and
she retreated to the front porch hoping to escape observation There
she nearly ran against Sir Redmond who was staring off into the dusk to
where the moon was peering redly over a black pinnacle of the Bear Paws

She would have slipped back into the house but he did not give her the
chance He turned and faced her steadily as he had more than once faced
the Boers when he knew that before him was nothing but defeat

So youre not going to England ever

Pride had squeezed every shade of emotion from his voice

No Beatrice gripped her fingers together tightly

Are you sure you wont be sorryafterward

Yes Im sure Beatrice had never done anything she hated more

Sir Redmond looking into her eyes wondered why those muchvaunted
sharpshooters the Boers had blundered and passed him by

I dont suppose it matters much nowbut will you tell me why I
believed you would decide differently He was holding his voice down to
a dead level and it was not easy

Because Beatrice faced the moon which threw a soft glow upon her
face and into her wonderful deep eyes a golden light Oh Im sorry
Sir Redmond But you see I didnt know II just learned today what
it means toto love II am going to stay here A new companyis
about to be formed Sir Redmond The Maltese Cross and theTriangle
Barare going to cast their lot together The golden glow deepened and
darkened and blended with the red blood which flushed cheek and brow
and throat

It took Sir Redmond a full minute to comprehend When he did he
breathed deep shut his lips upon words that would have frightened her
and went down the steps into the gloom

Beatrice watched him stride away into the dusky silence and her heart
ached with sympathy for him Then she looked beyond to where the lights
of the Cross ranch twinkled joyously far down the coulee and the sweet
egotism of happiness enfolded her shutting him out After that she
forgot him utterly She looked up at the moon sailing off to meet the
stars smiled goodfellowship and then went in to face her mother
