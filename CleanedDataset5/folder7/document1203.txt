A LIBERAL EDUCATION

Theres ingratitude for you Miss Dolly Foster exclaimed suddenly

Where I asked rousing myself from meditation

She pointed to a young man who had just passed where we sat He was
dressed very smartly and was walking with a lady attired in the height
of the fashion

I made that man said Dolly and now he cuts me dead before the whole
of the Row Its atrocious Why but for me do you suppose hed be at
this moment engaged to three thousand a year andand the plainest girl
in London

Not that I pleaded think of

Well very plain anyhow I was quite ready to bow to him I almost
did

In fact you did

I didnt I declare I didnt

Oh well you didnt then It only looked like it

I met him said Miss Dolly three years ago At that time he wasoh
quite unpresentable He was everything he shouldnt be He was a
teetotaler you know and he didnt smoke and he was always going to
concerts Oh and he wore his hair long and his trousers short and his
hat on the back of his head And his umbrella

Where did he wear that

He carried that Mr Carter Dont be silly Carried it unrolled
you know and generally a paper parcel in the other hand and he had
spectacles too

He has certainly changed outwardly at least

Yes I know well I did that I took him in hand and I just taught
him and now

Yes I know that But how did you teach him Give him Saturday evening
lectures or what

Oh everyevening lectures and mostmorning walks And I taught him to
dance and broke his wretched fiddle with my own hands

What very arbitrary distinctions you draw

I dont know that you mean I do like a man to be smart anyhow Dont
you Mr Carter Youre not so smart as you might be Now shall I take
you in hand And she smiled upon me

Lets hear your method What did you do to him

To Phil Meadows Oh nothing I just slipped in a remark here and
there whenever he talked nonsense I used to speak just at the right
time you know

But how had your words such influence Miss Foster

Oh well you know Mr Carter I made it a condition that he should do
just what I wanted in little things like that Did he think I was going
to walk about with a man carrying a brown paper parcelas if we had
been to the shop for a pound of tea

Still I dont see why he should alter all his

Oh you are stupid Of course he liked me you know

Oh did he I see

You seem to think that very funny

Not that he didbut that apparently he doesnt

Well you got out of that rather neatlyfor you No he doesnt now
You see he misunderstood my motive He thoughtwell I do believe he
thought I cared for him you know Of course I didnt

Not a bit

Just as a friendand a pupil you know And when hed had his hair
cut and bought a frock coat fancy hed never had one he looked quite
nice He has nice eyes Did you notice them

Lord no

Well youre so unobservant

Oh not always Ive observed that your

Please dont Its no use is it

I looked very unhappy There is an understanding that I am very unhappy
since Miss Fosters engagement to the Earl of Mickleham was announced

What was I saying beforebefore youyou knowoh about Phil Meadows
of course I did like him very much you know or I shouldnt have taken
all that trouble Why his own mother thanked me

I have no more to say said I

But she wrote me a horrid letter afterward

Youre so very elliptical

So very what Mr Carter

You leave so much out I mean After what

Why after I sent him away Didnt I tell you Oh we had the most
awful scene He raved Mr Carter He called me the most horrid names
and

Tore his hair

It wasnt long enough to get hold of she tittered But dont laugh
It was really dreadful And so unjust And then next day when I
thought it was comfortably over you know he came back andand
apologized and called himself the most awful names andwell that was
really worse

What did the fellow complain of I asked in wondering tones

Oh he said Id destroyed his faith in women you know and that Id
led him on and that I waswell he was very rude indeed And he went
on writing me letters like that for a whole year It made me quite
uncomfortable

But he didnt go back to short trousers and a fiddle did he I asked
anxiously

Oh no But he forgot all he owed me and he told me that his heart was
dead and that he should never love any one again

But hes going to marry that girl

Oh he doesnt care about her said Miss Dolly reassuringly Its the
money you know He hadnt a farthing of his own Now hell be set up
for life

And its all due to you said I admiringly

Well it is really

I dont call her such a badlooking girl though I hadnt seen her
face

Mr Carter Shes hideous

I dropped that subject

And now said Miss Dolly again he cuts me dead

It is the height of ingratitude Why to love you was a liberal
education

Yes wasnt it How nicely you put that A liberal education I shall
tell Archie Archie is Lord Mickleham

What about Phil Meadows

Goodness me no Mr Carter Just what you said you know

But why not tell Mickleham about Phil Meadows I urged Its all to
your credit you know

I know but men are so foolish You see Archie thinks

Of course he does

You might let me finish

Archie thinks you were never in love before

Yes he does Well of course I wasnt in love with Phil

Not a little bit

Oh well

Nor with any one else

Miss Dolly looked for an instant in my direction

Nor with any one else said I

Miss Dolly looked straight in front of her

Nor with I began

Hullo old chappie where did you spring from

Why Archie cried Miss Dolly

Oh how are you Mickleham old man Take this seat Im just offjust
off Yes I was upon my honorgot to meet a man at the club Goodbye
Miss Foster Jove Im late

And as I went I heard Miss Dolly say I thought you were never coming
Archie dear Well she didnt think he was coming just then No more
did I




CORDIAL RELATIONS

The other day I paid a call on Miss Dolly Foster for the purpose of
presenting to her my small offering on the occasion of her marriage to
Lord Mickleham It was a pretty little bit of jewelrya pearl heart
broken rubies played the part of blood and held together by a gold
pin set with diamonds the whole surmounted by an earls coronet I had
taken some trouble about it and was grateful when Miss Dolly asked me
to explain the symbolism

It is my heart I observed The fracture is your making the pin

Here Miss Dolly interrupted to tell the truth I was not sorry for I
was fairly graveled for the meaning of the pin

What nonsense Mr Carter she said but its awfully pretty Thanks
so very very much Arent relations funny people

If you wish to change the subject pray do said I Ill change
anything except my affections

Look here she pursued holding out a bundle of letters Here are the
congratulatory epistles from relations Shall I read you a few

It will be a most agreeable mode of passing the time said I

This is from Aunt Georgianashes a widowlives at Cheltenham My
dearest Dorothea

Who

Dorotheas my name Mr Carter It means the gift of heaven you know

My dearest Dorothea I have heard the news of your engagement to Lord
Mickleham with deep thankfulness To obtain the love of an honest man is
a great prize I hope you will prove worthy of it Marriage is a trial
and an opportunity

Hear hear said I A trial for the husband and

Be quiet Mr Carter A trial and an opportunity It searches the
heart and affords a sphere of usefulness which So she goes on you
know I dont see why I need be lectured just because Im going to be
married do you Mr Carter

Lets try another said I Whos that on pink paper

Oh thats Georgy Vane Shes awful fun Dear old DollySo youve
brought it off Hearty congrats I thought you were going to be silly
and throw away Theres nothing else there Mr Carter Look here
Listen to this Its from Uncle William Hes a clergyman you know My
dear NieceI have heard with great gratification of your engagement
Your aunt and I unite in all good wishes I recollect Lord Micklehams
father when I had a curacy near Worcester He was a regular attendant at
church and a supporter of all good works in the diocese If only his
son takes after him fancy Archie You have secured a prize I hope
you have a proper sense of the responsibilities you are undertaking
Marriage affords no small opportunities it also entails certain
trials

Why youre reading Aunt Georgiana again

Am I No its Uncle William

Then lets try a fresh castunless youll finish Georgy Vanes

Well heres Cousin Susans Shes an old maid you know Its very
long Heres a bit Woman has it in her power to exercise a sacred
influence I have not the pleasure of knowing Lord Mickleham but I
hope my dear that you will use your power over him for good It is
useless for me to deny that when you stayed with me I thought you were
addicted to frivolity Doubtless marriage will sober you Try to make a
good use of its lessons I am sending you a biscuit tinand so on

A very proper letter said I

Miss Dolly indulged in a slight grimace and took up another letter

This she said is from my sisterinlaw Mrs Algernon Foster

A daughter of Lord Doldrums wasnt she

Yes My dear DorotheaI have heard your news I do hope it will turn
out happily I believe that any woman who conscientiously does her duty
can find happiness in married life Her husband and children occupy
all her time and all her thoughts and if she can look for few of the
lighter pleasures of life she has at least the knowledge that she is of
use in the world Please accept the accompanying volumes its Browning
as a small I say Mr Carter do you think its really like that

There is still time to draw back I observed

Oh dont be silly Here this is my brother Toms Dear DolI
thought Mickleham rather an ass when I met him but I dare say you know
best Whats his place like Does he take a moor I thought I read that
he kept a yacht Does he Give him my love and a kiss Good luck old
girl Tom PSIm glad its not me you know

A disgusting letter I observed

Not at all said Miss Dolly dimpling Its just like dear old Tom
Listen to grandpapas My dear GranddaughterThe alliance I rather
like its being called an alliance Mr Carter It sounds like the Royal
Family doesnt it you are about to contract is in all respects a
suitable one I send you my blessing and a small check to help towards
your trousseauYours affectionately Jno Wm Foster

That said I is the best up to now

Yes its 500 said she smiling Heres old Lady Ms

Whose I exclaimed

Archies mothers you know My dear Dorothea as I suppose I must
call you nowArchibald has informed us of his engagement and I and
the girls there are five girls Mr Carter hasten to welcome his
bride I am sure Archie will make his wife very happy He is rather
particular like his dear father but he has a good heart and is not
fidgety about his meals Of course we shall be delighted to move out of
The Towers at once I hope we shall see a great deal of you soon Archie
is full of your praises and we thoroughly trust his taste Archie
Its all about Archie you see

Naturally said I

Well I dont know I suppose I count a little too Oh look here
Heres Cousin Freds but hes always so silly I shant read you his

O just a bit of it I pleaded

Well heres one bit I suppose I cant murder him so I must wish him
joy All I can say is Dolly that hes the luckiest something I cant
readeither fellow ordevil I ever heard of I wonder if youve
forgotten that evening

Well go on For she stopped

Oh theres nothing else

In fact you have forgotten the evening

Entirely said Miss Dolly tossing her head

But he sends me a love of a bracelet He cant possibly pay for it
poor boy

Young knave said I severely I had paid for my pearl heart

Then comes a lot from girls Oh theres one from Maud Tottenhamshes
a second cousin you knowits rather amusing I used to know your
FIANCE slightly He seemed very nice but its a long while ago and I
never saw much of him I hope he is really fond of you and that it is
not a mere fancy Since you love him so much it would be a pity if he
did not care deeply for you

Interpret Miss Dolly said I

She tried to catch him herself said Miss Dolly

Ah I see Is that all

The others arent very interesting

Then lets finish Georgy Vanes

Really she asked smiling

Yes Really

Oh if you dont mind I dont said she laughing and she hunted
out the pink note and spread it before her

Let me see Where was I Oh here I thought you were going to be
silly and throw away your chances on some of the men who used to flirt
with you Archie Mickleham may not be a genius but hes a good fellow
and a swell and rich and hes not a pauper like Phil Meadows or a
snob like Charlie Dawson or shall I go on Mr Carter No I wont
I didnt see what it was

Yes you shall go on

O no I cant and she folded up the letter Then I will and Im
ashamed to say I snatched the letter Miss Dolly jumped to her feet I
fled behind the table She ran round I dodged

Or I began to read

Stop cried she

Or a young spendthrift like that manI forget his namewho you used
to go on with at such a pace at Monte Carlo last winter

Stop she cried You must stop Mr Carter

So then I stopped I folded the letter and handed it back to her Her
cheeks flushed red as she took it

I thought you were a gentleman said she biting her lip

I was at Monte Carlo last winter myself said I

Lord Mickleham said the butler throwing open the door




RETRIBUTION

In future I am going to be careful what I do I am alsoand this is by
no means less importantgoing to be very careful what Miss Dolly Foster
does Everybody knows if I may quote her particular friend Nellie
Phaeton that dear Dolly means no harm but she is just a little
harumscarum I thanked Miss Phaeton for the expression

The fact is that old lady M Here I quote Miss Dolly sent for me the
other day I have not the honor of knowing the Countess and I went
in some trepidation When I was ushered in Lady Mickleham put up her
starers You know those abominations Pincenez with long tortureI
mean tortoiseshell handles

MrerCarter said she

I bowed I would have denied it if I could

My dears said Lady Mickleham

Upon this five young ladies who had been sitting in five straightbacked
chairs doing five pieces of embroidery rose bowed and filed out of
the room I felt very nervous

A pause followed Then the Countess observedand it seemed at first
rather irrelevant

Ive been reading an unpleasant story

In these days of French influence I began apologetically not that
I write such stories or any stories but Lady Mickleham invites an
apologetic attitude and my eye wandered to the table I saw nothing
worse or better than the morning paper there

Contained in a friends letter she continued focusing the starers
full on my face

I did not know what to do so I bowed again

It must have been as painful for her to write as for me to read Lady
Mickleham went on And that is saying much Be seated pray

I bowed and sat down in one of the straightback chairs I also began
in my fright to play with one of the pieces of embroidery

Is Lady Janes work in your way Lady Jane is named after Jane the
famous Countess LadyinWaiting to Caroline of Anspach

I dropped the embroidery and put my foot on my hat

I believe Mr Carter that you are acquainted with Miss Dorothea
Foster

I have that pleasure said I

Who is about to be married to my son the Earl of Mickleham

That I believe is so said I I was beginning to pull myself
together

My son Mr Carter is of a simple and trusting disposition Perhaps
I had better come to the point I am informed by this letter that in
conversation with the writer the other day Archibald mentioned quite
incidentally some very startling facts Those facts concern you Mr
Carter

May I ask the name of the writer

I do not think that is necessary said she She is a lady in whom I
have the utmost confidence

That is of course enough said I

It appears Mr Carterand you will excuse me if I speak plainlyI
set my teeth that you have in the first place given to my sons bride
a wedding present which I can only describe as

A pearl ornament I interposed with a ruby or two and

A pearl heart she corrected erfractured and that you explained
that this absurd article represented your heart

Mere badinage said I

In execrably bad taste said she

I bowed

In fact most offensive But that is not the worst From my sons
further statements it appears that on one occasion at least he found
you and Miss Foster engaged in what I can only call

I raised my hand in protest The Countess took no notice

What I can only call romping

Romping I cried

A thing not only atrociously vulgar at all times but under the
circumstancesneed I say more Mr Carter you were engaged in chasing
my sons future bride round a table

Pardon me Lady Mickleham Your sons future bride was engaged in
chasing me round a table

It is the same thing said Lady Mickleham

I should have thought there was a distinction said I

None at all

I fell back on a second line of defense

I didnt let her catch me Lady Mickleham I pleaded

Lady Mickleham grew quite red This made me feel more at my ease

No sir If you had

Goodness knows I murmured shaking my head

As it happened however my son entered in the middle of this
disgraceful

It was at the beginning said I with a regretful sigh

Upon thisand I have really never been so pleased at anything in all my
lifethe Countess the violence of her emotions penetrating to her very
fingers gripped the handle of her starers with such force that she
broke it in two She was a woman of the world and in a moment she
looked as if nothing had happened With me it was different and that
I am not now on Lady Micklehams visiting list is due to inter alia et
enormia the fact that I laughed It was out before I could help it In
a second I was as grave as a mute The mischief was done The Countess
rose I imitated her example

You are amused said she and her tones banished the last of my mirth
I stumbled on my hat and it rolled to her feet

It is not probable she observed that after Miss Fosters marriage
you will meet her often You will move inersomewhat different
circles

I may catch a glimpse of her in her carriage from the top of my bus
said I

Lady Mickleham rang the bell I stooped for my hat To tell the truth
I was rather afraid to expose myself in such a defenseless attitude but
the Countess preserved her self control The butler opened the door I
bowed and left the Countess regarding me through the maimed starers
Then I found the butler smiling He probably knew the signs of the
weather I wouldnt be Lady Micklehams butler if you made me a duke

As I walked home through the Park I met Miss Dolly and Mickleham They
stopped

I walked on Mickleham seized me by the coat tails

Do you mean to cut us he cried

Yes said I

Why what the deuce he began

Ive seen your mother said I I wish Mickleham that when you do
happen to intrude as you did the other day you wouldnt repeat what you
see

Lord he cried Shes not heard of that I only told Aunt Cynthia

I said something about Aunt Cynthia

Doesdoes she know it all asked Miss Dolly

More than allmuch more

Didnt you smooth it over said Miss Dolly reproachfully

On reflection said I I dont know that I didmuch I hadnt you
know

Suddenly Mickleham burst out laughing

What a game he exclaimed

Thats all very well for you said Dolly But do you happen to
remember that we dine there tonight Archie grew grave

I hope youll enjoy yourselves said I I always cling to the belief
that the wicked are punished And I looked at Miss Dolly

Never you mind little woman said Archie drawing Miss Dollys arm
through his Ill see you through After all everybody knows that old
Carters an ass

That piece of universal knowledge may help matters but I do not quite
see how I walked on for Miss Dolly had quite forgotten me and was
looking up at Archie Mickleham likewell hang it in the way they do
you know So I just walked on

I believe Miss Dolly has got a husband who is let us say good enough
for her And for one reason and another I am glad of it And I also
believe that she knows it And I amI supposeglad of that too Oh
yes of course I am Of course




THE PERVERSENESS OF IT

I tell you what Mr Carter said Miss Nellie Phaeton touching up
Rhino with her whip love in a cottage is

Lord forgive us cinders ashes dust I quoted

We were spanking round the Park behind Ready and Rhino Miss Phaetons
horses are very large her groom is very small and her courage is
indomitable I am no great hand at driving myself and I am not always
quite comfortable Moreover the stricter part of my acquaintance
consider I believe that Miss Phaetons attentions to me are somewhat
pronounced and that I ought not to drive with her in the Park

Youre right she went on What a girl wants is a good house and lots
of cash and some ridin and a little huntin and

A few gs I cried in shuddering entreaty If you love me a g or
two

Well I suppose so said she You cant go ridin without gees can
you

Apparently one could go driving without any but I did not pursue the
subject

Its only in stories that people are in love when they marry observed
Miss Phaeton reflectively

Yes and then its generally with somebody else said I

Oh if you count that said she hitting Ready rather viciously We
bounded forward and I heard the little groom bumping on the back seat
I am always glad not to be a groomits a cupandball sort of life
which must be very wearying

Were you ever in love she asked just avoiding a brougham which
contained the Duchess of Dexminster If by the way I have to run into
anyone I like it to be a Duchess you get a much handsomer paragraph

Yes said I

Often

Oh not too often and I always take great care you know

What of

That it shall be quite out of the question you know Its not at all
difficult I only have to avoid persons of moderate means

But arent you a person of

Exactly Thats why So I choose either a pauperwhen its
impossibleor an heiresswhen its preposterous See

But dont you ever want to get began Miss Phaeton

Lets talk about something else said I

I believe youre humbuggin me said Miss Phaeton

I am offering a veiled apology said I

Stuff said she You know you told Dolly Foster that I should make an
excellent wife for a trainer

Oh these women A man had better talk to a phonograph

Or anybody else said I politely

Miss Phaeton whipped up her horses

Look out Theres the mounted policeman I cried

No he isnt Are you afraid she retorted

Im not fit to die I pleaded

I dont care a pin for your opinion you know she continued I had
never supposed that she did but what did you mean by it

I never said it

Oh

All rightI never did

Then Dolly invented it

Of course said I steadily

On your honor

Oh come Miss Phaeton

Wouldwould other people think so she asked with a highly
surprising touch of timidity

Nobody would I said Only a snarling old wretch would say so just
because he thought it smart

There was a long pause Then Miss Phaeton asked me abruptly

You never met him did you

No

A pause ensued We passed the Duchess again and scratched the nose of
her poodle which was looking out of the carriage window Miss Phaeton
flicked Rhino and the groom behind went plopplop on the seat

He lives in town you know remarked Miss Phaeton

They mostly doand write about the country said I

Why shouldnt they she asked fiercely

My dear Miss Phaeton by all means let them said I

Hes awfully clever you know she continued but he wouldnt always
talk Sometimes he just sat and said nothin or read a book

A sudden intuition discovered Mr Gays feelings to me

You were talking about the run or something I suppose

Yes or the bag you know

As she spoke she pulled up Ready and Rhino The little groom jumped
down and stood under not at their heads I leant back and surveyed the
crowd sitting and walking Miss Phaeton flicked a fly off Rhinos ear
put her whip in the socket and leant back also

Then I suppose you didnt care much about him I asked

Oh I liked him pretty well she answered very carelessly

At this moment looking along the walk I saw a man coming toward us He
was a handsome fellow with just a touch of softness in his face He
was dressed in correct fashion save that his hair was a trifle longer
his coat a trifle fuller his hat a trifle larger his tie a trifle
looser than they were worn by most He caught my attention and I
went on looking at him for a little while till a light movement of my
companions made me turn my head

Miss Phaeton was sitting bolt upright she fidgeted with the reins
she took her whip out of the socket and put it back again and to my
amazement her cheeks were very red

Presently the man came opposite the carriage Miss Phaeton bowed He
lifted his hat smiled and made as if to pass on Miss Phaeton held
out her hand I could see a momentary gleam of surprise in his eyes
as though he thought her cordiality more than he might have looked
forpossibly even more than he cared about But he stopped and shook
hands

How are you Mr Gay she said not introducing me

Still with your inseparables he said gayly with a wave of his hand
towards the horses I hope Miss Phaeton that in the next world your
faithful steeds will be allowed to bear you company or what will you
do

O you think I care for nothin but horses said she petulantly but
she leant towards him and gave me her shoulder

O no he laughed Dogs also and Im afraid one day it was
ferrets wasnt it

Havehave you written any poetry lately she asked

How conscientious of you to inquire he exclaimed his eyes twinkling
O yes a hundred things Have youkilledanything lately

I could swear she flushed again Her voice trembled as she answered

No not lately

I caught sight of his face behind her back and I thought I saw a trace
of puzzlenothing more He held out his hand

Well so glad to have seen you Miss Phaeton said he but I must run
on Goodbye

Goodbye Mr Gay said she

And lifting his hat again smiling again gayly he was gone For a
moment or two I said nothing Then I remarked

So thats your friend Gay is it Hes not a badlooking fellow

Yes thats him said she and as she spoke she sank back in her
seat for a moment I did not look at her face Then she sat up straight
again and took the whip

Want to stay any longer she asked

No said I

The little groom sprang away Rhino and Ready dashed ahead

Shall I drop you at the club she asked Im goin home

Ill get out here said I

We came to a stand again and I got down

Goodbye I said

She nodded at me but said nothing A second later the carriage was
tearing down the road and the little groom hanging on for dear life

Of course its all nonsense Shes not the least suited to him shed
make him miserable and then be miserable herself But it seems a little
perverse doesnt it In fact twice at least between the courses at
dinner I caught myself being sorry for her It is when you think of it
so remarkably perverse




A MATTER OF DUTY

Lady Mickleham is back from her honeymoon I mean young Lady
MicklehamDolly Foster well of course I do Fancy the Dowager on a
honeymoon She signified the fact to me by ordering me to call on her
at teatime she had she said something which she wished to consult me
about confidentially I went

I didnt know you were back I observed

Oh weve been back a fortnight but we went down to The Towers They
were all there Mr Carter

All who

All Archies people The dowager said we must get really to know one
another as soon as possible Im not sure I like really knowing people
It means that they say whatever they like to you and dont get up out
of your favorite chair when you come in

I agree said I that a soupcon of unfamiliarity is not amiss

Of course its nice to be one of the family she continued

The cat is that said I I would not give a fig for it

And the Dowager taught me the ways of the house

Ah she taught me the way out of it

And showed me how to be most disagreeable to the servants

It is the first lesson of a housekeeper

And told me what Archie particularly liked and how bad it was for him
poor boy

What should we do without our mothers I do not however see how I can
help in all this Lady Mickleham

How funny that sounds

Arent you accustomed to your dignity yet

I meant from you Mr Carter

I smiled That is Dollys way As Miss Phaeton says she means no harm
and it is admirably conducive to the pleasure of a teteatete

It wasnt that I wanted to ask you about she continued after she had
indulged in a pensive sigh with a dutifully bright smile and a glance
at Archies photograph to follow Her behavior always reminds me of
a varied and well assorted menu It was about something much more
difficult You wont tell Archie will you

This becomes interesting I remarked putting my hat down

You know Mr Carter that before I was marriedoh how long ago it
seems

Not at all

Dont interrupt That before I was married I had severalthat is to
say severalwell several

Start quite afresh I suggested encouragingly

Well then several men were silly enough to think themselvesyou
know

No one better I assented cheerfully

Oh if you wont be sensibleWell you see many of them are Archies
friends as well as mine and of course theyve been to call

It is but good manners said I

One of them waited to be sent for though

Leave that fellow out said I

What I want to ask you is thisand I believe youre not silly really
you know except when you choose to be

Walk in the Row any afternoon said I and you wont find ten wiser
men

Its this Ought I to tell Archie

Good gracious Heres a problem

Of course pursued Lady Mickleham opening her fan its in some ways
more comfortable that he shouldnt know

For him

Yesand for me But then it doesnt seem quite fair

To him

Yesand to me Because if he came to know from anybody else he might
exaggerate the things you know

Impossible

Mr Carter

Iermean he knows you too well to do such a thing

Oh I see Thank you Yes What do you think

What does the Dowager say

I havent mentioned it to the Dowager

But surely on such a point her experience

She cant have any said Lady Mickleham decisively I believe in
her husband because I must But nobody else Youre not giving me your
opinion

I reflected for a moment

Havent we left out one point to view I ventured to suggest

Ive thought it all over very carefully said she both as it would
affect me and as it would affect Archie

Quite so Now suppose you think how it would affect them

Who

Why the men

Lady Mickleham put down her cup of tea What a very curious idea she
exclaimed

Give it time to sink in said I helping myself to another piece of
toast She sat silent for a few momentspresumably to allow of the
permeation I suggested I finished my tea and leant back comfortably
Then I said

Let me take my own case Shouldnt I feel rather awkward

Oh its no good taking your case she interrupted

Why not mine as well as another

Because I told him about you long ago

I was not surprised But I could not permit Lady Mickleham to laugh
at me in the unconscionable manner in which she proceeded to laugh I
spread out my hands and observed blandly

Why not be guidedas to the others I meanby your husbands
example

Archies example Whats that

I dont know but you do I suppose

What do you mean Mr Carter she asked sitting upright

Well has he ever told you about Maggie Adeane

I never heard of her

Or Lilly Courtenay

That girl

Or Alice Layton

The redhaired Layton

Or Florence Cunliffe

Who was she

Or Millie Trehearne

She squints Mr Carter

Or

Stop stop What do you mean What should he tell me

Oh I see he hasnt Nor I suppose about Sylvia Fenton or that
little Delancy girl or handsome Misswhat was her name

Hold your tongueand tell me what you mean

Lady Mickleham said I gravely if your husband has not thought fit
to mention these ladiesand others whom I could nameto you how could
I presume

Do you mean to tell me that Archie

Hed only known you three years you see

Then it was before

Some of them were before said I

Lady Mickleham drew a long breath

Archie will be in soon said she

I took my hat

It seems to me I observed that what is saucethat I should say
husband and wife ought to stand on an equal footing in these matters
Since he hasno doubt for good reasonsnot mentioned to you

Alice Layton was a positive fright

She came last said I Just before you you know However as I was
saying

And that horrible Sylvia Fenton

Oh he couldnt have known you long then As I was saying I should if
I were you treat him as he has treated you In my case it seems to be
too late

Im sorry I told him that

Oh pray dont mind its of no consequence As to the others

I should never have thought it of Archie

One never knows said I with an apologetic smile I dont suppose he
thinks it of you

I wont tell him a single word He may find out if he likes Who was
the last girl you mentioned

Is it any use trying to remember all their names I asked in a
soothing tone No doubt hes forgotten them by nowjust as youve
forgotten the others

And the Dowager told me that he had never had an attachment before

Oh if the Dowager said that Of course the Dowager would know

Dont be so silly for goodness sake Are you going

Certainly I am It might annoy Archie to find me here when he wants to
talk to you

Well I want to talk to him

Of course you wont repeat what Ive

I shall find out for myself she said

Goodbye I hope Ive removed all your troubles

O yes thank you I know what to do now Mr Carter

Always send for me if youre in any trouble I have some exp

Goodbye Mr Carter

Goodbye Lady Mickleham And remember that Archie like you

Yes yes I know Must you go

Im afraid I must Ive enjoyed our talk so

Theres Archies step

I left the room On the stairs I met Archie I shook hands
sympathetically I was sorry for Archie But in great causes the
individual cannot be considered I had done my duty to my sex




MY LAST CHANCE

Now mind said Mrs Hilary Musgrave impressively this is the last
time I shall take any trouble about you Shes a very nice girl quite
pretty and shell have a lot of money You can be very pleasant when
you like

This unsolicited testimonial

Which isnt oftenand if you dont do it this time I wash my hands of
you Why how old are you

Hush Mrs Hilary

You must be nearly

Its falsefalsefalse

Come along said Mrs Hilary and she added over her shoulder she
has a slight northcountry accent

It might have been Scotch said I

She plays the piano a good deal

It might have been the fiddle said I

Shes very fond of Browning

It might have been Ibsen said I

Mrs Hilary seeing that I was determined to look on the bright side
smiled graciously on me and introduced me to the young lady She
was decidedly goodlooking fresh and sincere of aspect with large
inquiring eyeseyes which I felt would demand a little too much of me
at breakfastbut then a large teaurn puts that all right

Miss Sophia MiltonMr Carter said Mrs Hilary and left us

Well we tried the theaters first but as she had only been to the
Lyceum and I had only been to the Gaioety we soon got to the end of
that Then we tried Art she asked me what I thought of Degas I
evaded the question by criticizing a drawing of a horse in last weeks
Punchwhich she hadnt seen Upon this she started literature She said
Some Qualms and a Shiver was the book of the season I put my money on
The Queen of the Quorn Dead stop again And I saw Mrs Hilarys
eye upon me there was wrath in her face Something must be done A
brilliant idea seized me I had read that fourfifths of the culture of
England were Conservative I also was a Conservative It was four to
one on I started politics I could have whooped for joy when I elicited
something particularly incisive about the ignorance of the masses

I do hope you agree with me said Miss Milton The more one reads
and thinks the more one sees how fatally false a theory it is that the
ignorant massespeople such as I have describedcan ever rule a great
Empire

The Empire wants gentlemen thats what it wants said I nodding my
head and glancing triumphantly at Mrs Hilary

Men and women said she who are acquainted with the best that has
been said and thought on all important subjects

At the time I believed this observation to be original but I have since
been told that it was borrowed I was delighted with it

Yes said I and have got a stake in the country you know and know
how to behave emselves in the House dont you know

What we have to do pursued Miss Milton is to guide the voters
These poor rustics need to be informed

Just so I broke in They have to be told

Of the real nature of the questions

And which candidate to support

Or they must infalliblyshe exclaimed

Get their marching orders I cried in rapture It was exactly what I
always did on my small property

Oh I didnt quite mean that she said reproachfully

Oh well neither did Iquite I responded adroitly What was wrong
with the girl now

But with the help of the League she went on

Do you belong I cried more delighted than ever

O yes said she I think its a duty I worked very hard at the last
election I spent days distributing packages of

Then I made Im sorry to say a false step I observed interrupting

But its ticklish work now eh Six months hard wouldnt be
pleasant would it

What do you mean Mrer Carter she asked

I was still blind I believe I winked and Im sure I whispered Tea

Miss Milton drew herself up very straight

I do not bribe she said What I distribute is pamphlets

Now I suppose that pamphlets and blankets dont really sound much
alike but I was agitated

Quite right said I Poor old things They cant afford proper fuel

She rose to her feet

I was not joking she said with horrible severity

Neither was I I declared in humble apology Didnt you say
blankets

Pamphlets

Oh

There was a long pause I glanced at Mrs Hilary Things had not fallen
out as happily as they might but I did not mean to give up yet

I see youre right I said still humbly To descend to such means as
I had in my mind is

To throw away our true weapons said she earnestly She sat down
againgood sign

What we really need I began

Is a reform of the upper classes said she

Let them give an example of duty of selfdenial of frugality

I was not to be caught out again

Just what I always say I observed impressively

Let them put away their horse racing their betting their luxurious
living their

Youre right Miss Milton said I

Let them set an example of morality

They should I assented

Miss Milton smiled

I thought we agreed really said she

Im sure we do cried I and I winked with my off eye at Mrs Hilary
as I sat down beside Miss Milton

Now I heard of a man the other day said she whos nearly 40 Hes
got an estate in the country He never goes there except for a few
days shooting He lives in town He spends too much He passes an
absolutely vacant existence in a round of empty gaiety He has by no
means a good reputation He dangles about wasting his time and his
money Is that the sort of example

Hes a traitor to his class said I warmly

If you want him you must look on a race course or at a tailors or
in some fashionable womans boudoir And his estate looks after itself
Hes too selfish to marry too idle to work too silly to think

I began to be sorry for this man in spite of his peccadilloes

I wonder if Ive met him said I Im occasionally in town when I
can get time to run up Whats his name

I dont think I heardor Ive forgotten But hes got the place next
to a friend of mine in the country and she told me all about him Shes
exactly the opposite sort of personor she wouldnt be my friend

I should think not Miss Milton said I admiringly

Oh I should like to meet that man and tell him what I think of
him said she Such men as he do more harm than a dozen agitators So
contemptible too

Its revolting to think of said I

Im so glad you began Miss Milton quite confidentially I pulled
my chair a trifle closer and cast an apparently careless glance towards
Mrs Hilary Suddenly I heard a voice behind me

Eh what Upon my honor it is Why Carter my boy how are you Eh
what Miss Milton too I declare Well now what a pity Annie didnt
come

I disagreed I hate Annie But I was very glad to see my friend and
neighbor Robert Dinnerly Hes a sensible manhis wifes a little
prig

Oh Mr Dinnerly cried Miss Milton how funny that you should come
just now I was just trying to remember the name of a man Mrs Dinnerly
told me about I was telling Mr Carter about him You know him

Well Miss Milton perhaps I do Describe him

I dont believe Annie ever told me his name but she was talking about
him at our house yesterday

But I wasnt there Miss Milton

No said Miss Milton but hes got the next place to yours in the
country

I positively leaped from my seat

Why good gracious Carter himself you mean cried Dinnerly
laughing Well that is a good unhahaha

She turned a stony glare on me

Do you live next to Mr Dinnerly in the country she asked

I would have denied it if Dinnerly had not been there As it was I blew
my nose

I wonder said Miss Milton what has become of Aunt Emily

Miss Milton said I by a happy chance you have enjoyed a luxury You
have told the man what you think of him

Yes said she and I have only to add that he is also a hypocrite

Pleasant wasnt it Yet Mrs Hilary says it was my fault Thats a
woman all over




THE LITTLE WRETCH

Seeing that little Johnny Tompkins was safely out of the country under
injunctions to make a new man of himself and to keep that new man when
made at the Antipodes I could not see anything indiscreet in touching
on the matter in the course of conversation with Mrs Hilary Musgrave
In point of fact I was curious to find out what she knew and supposing
she knew what she thought So I mentioned little Johnny Tompkins

Oh the little wretch cried Mrs Hilary You know he came here two
or three times Anybody can impose on Hilary

Happy woman II mean unhappy man Mrs Hilary

And how much was it he stole

Hard on a thousand said I For a time you know he was quite a man
of fashion

Oh I know He came here in his own hansom perfectly dressed and

Behaved all right didnt he

Yes Of course there was a something

Or you wouldnt have been deceived said I with a smile

I wasnt deceived said Mrs Hilary an admirable flush appearing on
her cheeks

That is to say Hilary wouldnt

Oh Hilary Why didnt his employers prosecute him Mr Carter

In the first place he had that inestimable advantage in a career of
dishonestyrespectable relations

Well but still

His widowed mother was a trump you know

Do you mean a good woman

Doubtless she was but I mean a good card However there was another
reason

I cant see any declared Mrs Hilary

Im going to surprise you said I Hilary interceded for him

Hilary

You didnt know it I thought not Well he did

Why he always pretended to want him to be convicted

Cunning Hilary said I

He used to speak most strongly against him

That was his guile said I

Oh but why in the world she began then she paused and went on
again It was nothing to do with Hilary

Hilary went with me to see him you know while they had him under lock
and key at the firms offices

Did he I never heard that

And he was much impressed with his bearing

Well I suppose Mr Carter that if he was really penitent

Never saw a man less penitent I interrupted He gloried in his
crime if I remember his exact expression it was that the jam was jolly
well worth the powder and if they liked to send him to chokee they
could and beand suffer accordingly you know

And after that Hilary

Oh anybody can impose on Hilary you know Hilary only asked what the
jam was

Its a horrid expression but I suppose it meant acting the part of a
gentleman didnt it

Not entirely According to what he told Hilary Johnny was in love

Oh and he stole for some wretched

Now do be careful What do you know about the lady

The lady I can imagine Johnny Tompkinss ideal

So can I if you come to that

And she must have known his money wasnt his own

Why must she I asked According to what he told Hilary she didnt

I dont believe it said Mrs Hilary with decision

Hilary believed it

Oh Hilary

But then Hilary knew the girl

Hilary knew You mean to say Hilary knew

No one better said I composedly

Mrs Hilary rose to her feet Who was the creature she asked sharply

Come I expostulated how would you like it if your young man had
taken to theft and

Oh nonsense Tell me her name please Mr Carter

Johnny told Hilary that just to see her and talk to her and sit by her
side was worth all the moneybut then to be sure it was somebody
elses moneyand that hed do it again to get what he had got over
again Then Im sorry to say he swore

And Hilary believed that stuff

Hilary agreed with him said I Hilary you see knows the lady

Whats her name Mr Carter

Didnt you notice his attentions to any one

I notice You dont mean that Ive seen her

Certainly you have

Was she ever here

Yes Mrs Hilary Hilary takes care of that

I shall be angry in a minute Mr Carter Oh Ill have this out of
Hilary

I should

Who was she

According to what he told Hilary she was the most fascinating woman in
the world Hilary thought so too

Mrs Hilary began to walk up and down

Oh so Hilary helped to let him go because they both

Precisely said I

And you dare to come and tell me

Well I thought you ought to know said I Hilarys just as mad about
her as Johnnyin fact he said hed be hanged if he wouldnt have done
the same himself

I have once seen Madame Ristori play Lady Macbeth Her performance was
recalled to me by the tones in which Mrs Hilary asked

Who is this woman if you please Mr Carter

So Hilary got him offgave him fifty pounds too

Glad to get him away perhaps she burst out in angry scorn

Who knows said I Perhaps

Her name demanded Lady MacbethI mean Mrs Hilaryagain

I shant tell you unless you promise to say nothing to Hilary

To say nothing Well really

Oh all right and I took up my hat

But I can watch them cant I

As much as you like

Wont you tell me

If you promise

Well then I promise

Look in the glass

What for

To see your face to be sure

She started blushed red and moved a step towards me

You dont mean she cried

Thou art the woman said I

Oh but he never said a word

Johnny had his code said I And in some ways it was better than some
peoplesin some alas worse

And Hilary

Really you know better than I do whether Ive told the truth about
Hilary

A pause ensued Then Mrs Hilary made three short remarks which I give
in their order

1 The little wretch 2 Dear old Hilary 3 Poor little man

I took my hat I knew that Hilary was due from the city in a few
minutes Mrs Hilary sat down by the fire

How dare you torment me so she asked but not in the least like Lady
Macbeth

I must have my little amusements said I

What an audacious little creature said Mrs Hilary Fancy his
daringArent you astounded

Oh yes I am But Hilary you see

Its nearly his time said Mrs Hilary

I buttoned my left glove and held out my right hand

Ive a good mind not to shake hands with you said she Wasnt it
absurd of Hilary

Horribly

He ought to have been all the more angry

Of course he ought

The presumption of it And Mrs Hilary smiled I also smiled

That poor old mother of his reflected Mrs Hilary Where did you say
she lived

Hilary knows the address said I

Silly little wretch mused Mrs Hilary still smiling

Goodbye said I

Goodbye said Mrs Hilary

I turned toward the door and had laid my hand on the knob when Mrs
Hilary called softly

Mr Carter

Yes said I turning

Do you know where the little wretch has gone

Oh yes said I

II suppose you dont ever write to him

Dear me no said I

But youcould suggested Mrs Hilary

Of course said I

She jumped up and ran towards me Her purse was in one hand and a bit
of paper fluttered in the other

Send him thatdont tell him she whispered and her voice had a
little catch in it Poor little wretch said she

As for me I smiled cynicallyquite cynically you know for it was
very absurd

Please do said Mrs Hilary

And I went

Supposing it had been another woman Well I wonder




AN EXPENSIVE PRIVILEGE

A rather uncomfortable thing happened the other day which threatened a
schism in my acquaintance and put me in a decidedly awkward position It
was no other than this Mrs Hilary Musgrave had definitely informed me
that she did not approve of Lady Mickleham The attitude is no doubt a
conceivable one but I was surprised that a woman of Mrs Hilarys large
sympathies should adopt it Besides Mrs Hilary is quite goodlooking
herself

The history of the affair is much as follows I called on Mrs Hilary
to see whether I could do anything and she told me all about it It
appears that Mrs Hilary had a bad cold and a cousin up from the country
about the same time she was justly aggrieved at the double event and
being unable to go to the Duchess of Dexminsters squash she asked
Dolly Mickleham to chaperon little Miss Phyllis Little Miss Phyllis of
course knew no one therethe Duchess least of allbut then very few
of usyes I was thereknew the Duchess and the Duchess didnt know
any of us I saw her shake hands with a waiter myself just to be on
the safe side and an hour after the party began she was discovered
wandering about in a most desolate condition Dolly had told her that
she would be in a certain place and when Miss Phyllis came Dolly was
not there The poor little lady wandered about for another hour looking
so lost that one was inclined to send for a policeman and then she sat
down on a seat by the wall and in desperation asked her nextdoor
neighbor if he knew Lady Mickleham by sight and had he seen her lately
The nextdoor neighbor by way of reply called out to a quiet elderly
gentleman who was sidling unobtrusively about Duke are there any
particularly snug corners in your house The Duke stopped searched
his memory and said that at the end of the Red Corridor there was
a passage and that a few yards down the passage if you turned very
suddenly to the right you would come on a little nook under the stairs
The little nook just held a settee and the settee the Duke thought
might just hold two people The nextdoor neighbor thanked the Duke and
observed to Miss Phyllis

It will give me great pleasure to take you to Lady Mickleham So
they went it being then according to Miss Phyllis sworn statement
precisely two hours and five minutes since Dolly had disappeared and
pursuing the route indicated by the Duke they found Lady Mickleham And
Lady Mickleham exclaimed Good gracious my dear Id quite forgotten
you Have you had an ice Do take her to have an ice Sir John Sir
John Berry was the nextdoor neighbor And with that Lady Mickleham is
said to have resumed her conversation

Did you ever hear anything more atrocious concluded Mrs Hilary I
really cannot think what Lord Mickleham is doing

You surely mean what Lady Mickleham

No I dont said Mrs Hilary with extraordinary decision Anything
might have happened to that poor child

Oh there were not many of the aristocracy present said I soothingly

But its not that so much as the thing itself Shes the most
disgraceful flirt in London

How do you know she was flirting I inquired with a smile

How do I know echoed Mrs Hilary

It is a very hasty conclusion I persisted Sometimes I stay talking
with you for an hour or more Are you therefore flirting with me

With you exclaimed Mrs Hilary with a little laugh

Absurd as the supposition is I remarked it yet serves to point the
argument Lady Mickleham might have been talking with a friend just in
the quiet rational way in which we are talking now

I dont think thats likely said Mrs Hilary andwell I do not
like to say that she sniffedit would convey too strong an idea but
she did make an odd little sound something like a much etherealized
sniff

I smiled again and more broadly I was enjoying beforehand the little
victory which I was to enjoy over Mrs Hilary Yet it happens to be
true said I

Mrs Hilary was magnificently contemptuous

Lord Mickleham told you so I suppose she asked And I suppose Lady
Mickleham told himpoor man

Why do you call him poor man

Oh never mind Did he tell you

Certainly not The fact is Mrs Hilaryand really you must excuse me
for having kept you in the dark a littleit amused me so much to hear
your suspicions

Mrs Hilary rose to her feet

Well what are you going to say she asked

I laughed as I answered Why I was the man with Lady Mickleham when
your friend and Berry interwhen they arrived you know

Well I should have thoughtI should still thinkthat she would have
been pleasedrelieved you know to find her uncharitable opinion
erroneous and pleased to have it altered on the best authority Im
sure that is how I should have felt It was not however how Mrs
Hilary felt

I am deeply pained she observed after a long pause and then she held
out her hand

I was sure youd forgive my little deception said I grasping it I
thought still that she meant to bury all unkindness

I should never have thought it of you she went on

I didnt know your friend was there at all I pleaded for by now I
was alarmed

Oh please dont shuffle like that said Mrs Hilary

She continued to stand and I rose to my feet Mrs Hilary held out her
hand again

Do you mean that Im to go said I

I hope we shall see you again some day said Mrs Hilary the tone
suggested that she was looking forward to some future existence when
my earthly sins should have been sufficiently purged It reminded me for
the moment of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere

But I protest I began that my only object in telling you was to
show you how absurd

Is it any good talking about it now asked Mrs Hilary A discussion
might possibly be fruitful in the dim futurity before mentionedbut not
nowthat was what she seemed to say

Lady Mickleham and I on the occasion in question I began with
dignity

Pray spare me quote Mrs Hilary with much greater dignity

I took my hat

Shall you be at home as usual on Thursday I asked

I have a great many people coming already she remarked

I can take a hint said I

I wish youd take warning said Mrs Hilary

I will take my leave said Iand I did leaving Mrs Hilary in a
tragic attitude in the middle of the room Never again shall I go out of
my way to lull Mrs Hilarys suspicions

A day or two after this very trying interview Lady Micklehams victoria
happened to stop opposite where I was seated in the park I went to pay
my respects

Do you mean to leave me nothing in the world I asked just by way
of introducing the subject of Mrs Hilary One of my best friends has
turned me out of her house on your account

Oh do tell me said Dolly dimpling all over her face

So I told her I made the story as long as I could for reasons connected
with the dimples

What fun exclaimed Dolly I told you at the time that a young
unmarried person like you ought to be more careful

I am just debating I observed whether to sacrifice you

To sacrifice me Mr Carter

Of course I explained if I dropped you Mrs Hilary would let me
come again

How charming that would be cried Dolly You would enjoy her nice
serious conversationall about Hilary

She is apt I conceded to touch on Hilary But she is very
picturesque

Oh yes shes handsome said Dolly

There was a pause Then Dolly said Well

Well said I in return

It is goodbye asked Dolly drawing down the corners of her mouth

It comes to this I remarked Supposing I forgive you

As if it was my fault

And risk Mrs Hilarys wrathdid you speak

No I laughed Mr Carter

What shall I get out of it

The sun was shining brightly it shone on Dolly she had raised her
parasol but she blinked a little beneath it She was smiling slightly
still and the dimple stuck to its postlike a sentinel ready to
rouse the rest from their brief repose Dolly lay back in the victoria
nestling luxuriously against the soft cushions She turned her eyes for
a moment on me

Why are you looking at me she asked

Because said I there is nothing better to look at

Do you like doing it asked Dolly

It is a privilege said I politely

Well then said Dolly

But I ventured to observe its rather an expensive one

Then you mustnt have it very often

And it is shared by so many people

Then said Dolly smiling indulgently you must have ita little
oftener Home Roberts please

I am not yet allowed at Mrs Hilary Musgraves




A VERY DULL AFFAIR

To hear you talk remarked Mrs Hilary Musgraveand if any one is
surprised to find me at her house I can only say that Hilary when
he asked me to take a potluck was quite ignorant of any ground of
difference between his wife and myself and that Mrs Hilary could not
very well eject me on my arrival in evening dress at ten minutes to
eightto hear you talk one would think that there was no such thing as
real love

She paused I smiled

Now she continued turning a fine but scornful eye upon me I have
never cared for any man in the world except my husband

I smiled again Poor Hilary looked very uncomfortable With an
apologetic air he began to stammer something about Parish Councils I
was not to be diverted by any such maneuver It was impossible that he
could really wish to talk on that subject

Would a person who had never eaten anything but beef make a boast of
it I asked

Hilary grinned covertly Mrs Hilary pulled the lamp nearer and took up
her embroidery

Do you always work the same pattern said I

Hilary kicked me gently Mrs Hilary made no direct reply but presently
she began to talk

I was just about Phylliss ageby the way little Miss Phyllis was
therewhen I first saw Hilary You remember Hilary At Bournemouth

Oherwas it Bournemouth said Hilary with much carelessness

I was on the pier pursued Mrs Hilary I had a red frock on I
remember and one of those big hats they wore that year Hilary wore

Blue serge I interpolated encouragingly

Yes blue serge said she fondly He had been yachting and he was
beautifully burnt I was horribly burntwasnt I Hilary

Hilary began to pat the dog

Then we got to know one another

Stop a minute said I How did that happen Mrs Hilary blushed

Well we were both always on the pier she explained Andand
somehow Hilary got to know father andand father introduced him to
me

Im glad it was no worse said I I was considering Miss Phyllis who
sat listening openeyed

And then you know father wasnt always there and once or twice we met
on the cliff Do you remember that morning Hilary

What morning asked Hilary patting the dog with immense assiduity

Why the morning I had my white serge on Id been bathing and my hair
was down to dry and you said I looked like a mermaid

Do mermaids wear white serge I asked but nobody took the least
notice of mequite properly

And you told me such a lot about yourself and then we found we were
late for lunch

Yes said Hilary suddenly forgetting the dog and your mother gave
me an awful glance

Yes and then you told me that you were very poor but that you
couldnt help it and you said you supposed I couldnt possibly

Well I didnt think

And I said you were a silly old thing and then Mrs Hilary stopped
abruptly

How lovely remarked little Miss Phyllis in a wistful voice

And do you remember pursued Mrs Hilary laying down her embroidery
and clasping her hands on her knees the morning you went to see
father

What a row there was said Hilary

And what an awful week it was after that I was never so miserable in
all my life I cried till my eyes were quite red and then I bathed
them for an hour and then I went to the pier and you were thereand I
mightnt speak to you

I remember said Hilary nodding gently

And then Hilary father sent for me and told me it was no use and I
said Id never marry any one else And father said There there dont
cry Well see what mother says

Your mother was a brick said Hilary poking the fire

And that night they never told me anything about it and I didnt even
change my frock but came down looking horrible just as I was in an
old black ragno Hilary dont say it was pretty

Hilary unconvinced shook his head

And when I walked into the drawing room there was nobody there but
just you and we neither of us said anything for ever so long And then
father and mother came in anddo you remember after dinner Hilary

I remember said Hilary

There was a long pause Mrs Hilary was looking into the fire little
Miss Phylliss eyes were fixed in rapt gaze on the ceiling Hilary was
looking at his wifeI thinking it safest was regarding my own boots

At last Miss Phyllis broke the silence

How perfectly lovely she said

Yes said Mrs Hilary reflectively And we were married three months
afterwards

Tenth of June said Hilary reflectively

And we had the most charming little rooms in the world Do you remember
those first rooms dear So tiny

Not bad little rooms said Hilary

How awfully lovely cried little Miss Phyllis

I felt that it was time to interfere

And is that all I asked

All How do you mean said Mrs Hilary with a slight start

Well I mean did nothing else happen Werent there any complications
Werent there any more troubles or any more opposition or any
misunderstandings or anything

No said Mrs Hilary

You never quarreled or broke it off

No

Nobody came between you

No It all went just perfectly Why of course it did

Hilarys people made themselves nasty perhaps I suggested with a
ray of hope

They fell in love with her on the spot said Hilary

Then I rose and stood with my back to the fire

I do not know I observed what Miss Phyllis thinks about it

I think it was just perfect Mr Carter

But for my part I can only say that I never heard of such a dull
affair in all my life

Dull gasped Miss Phyllis

Dull murmured Mrs Hilary

Dull chuckled Hilary

It was said I severely without a spark of interest from beginning
to end Such things happen by thousands Its commonplaceness itself I
had some hopes when you father assumed a firm attitude but

Mother was such a dear interrupted Mrs Hilary

Just so She gave away the whole situation Then I did trust that
Hilary would lose his place or develop an old flame or do something
just a little interesting

It was a perfect time said Mrs Hilary

I wonder why in the world you told me about it I pursued

I dont know why I did said Mrs Hilary dreamily

The only possible excuse for an engagement like that I observed is
to be found in intense postnuptial unhappiness

Hilary rose and advanced towards his wife

Your embroiderys falling on the floor said he

Not a bit of it said I

Yes it is he persisted and he picked it up and gave it to her Miss
Phyllis smiled delightedly Hilary had squeezed his wifes hand

Then we dont excuse it said he

I took out my watch I was not finding much entertainment

Surely its quite early old man said Hilary

Its nearly eleven Weve spent halfanhour on the thing said I
peevishly holding out my hand to my hostess

Oh are you going Good night Mr Carter

I turned to Miss Phyllis

I hope you wont think all love affairs are like that I said but I
saw her lips begin to shape into lovely and I hastily left the room

Hilary came to help me on with my coat He looked extremely apologetic
and very much ashamed of himself

Awfully sorry old chap said he that we bored you with our
reminiscences I know of course that they cant be very interesting to
other people Women are so confoundedly romantic

Dont try that on me said I much disgusted You were just as bad
yourself

He laughed as he leant against the door

She did look ripping in that white frock he said with her hair

Stop said I firmly She looked just like a lot of other girls

Im hanged if she did said Hilary

Then he glanced at me with a puzzled sort of expression

I say old man werent you ever that way yourself he asked

I hailed a hansom cab

Because if you were you know youd understand how a fellow remembers
every

Good night said I At least I suppose youre not coming to the
club

Well I think not said Hilary Tata old fellow Sorry we bored
you Of course if a man has never

Never I groaned A score of times

Well then doesnt it

No said I Its just that that makes stories like yours so
infernally

What asked Hilary for I had paused to light a cigarette

Uninteresting said I getting into my cab




STRANGE BUT TRUE

The other day my young cousin George lunched with me He is a cheery
youth and a member of the University of Oxford He refreshes me very
much and I believe that I have the pleasure of affording him some
matter for thought On this occasion however he was extremely silent
and depressed I said little but made an extremely good luncheon
Afterwards we proceeded to take a stroll in the Park

Sam old boy said George suddenly Im the most miserable devil
alive

I dont know what else you expect at your age I observed lighting a
cigar He walked on in silence for a few moments

I say Sam old boy when you were young were you ever he paused
arranged his neckcloth it was more like a bedquiltoh the fashion
of course I know that and blushed a fine crimson

Was I ever what George I had the curiosity to ask

Oh well hard hit you knowa girl you know

In love you mean George No I never was

Never

No Are you

Yes Hang it Then he looked at me with a puzzled air and continued

I say though Sam its awfully funny you shouldnt havedont you
know what its like then

How should I I inquired apologetically What is it like George

George took my arm

Its just Hades he informed me confidentially

Then I remarked I have no reason to regret

Still you know interrupted George its not half bad

That appears to me to be a paradox I observed

Its precious hard to explain it to you if youve never felt it said
George in rather an injured tone But what I say is quite true

I shouldnt think of contradicting you my dear fellow I hastened to
say

Lets sit down said he and watch the people driving We may see
somebodysomebody we know you know Sam

So we may said I and we sat down

A fellow pursued George with knitted brows is all turned upside
down dont you know

How very peculiar I exclaimed

One moment hes the happiest dog in the world and the nextwell the
next its the deuce

But I objected not surely without good reason for such a change

Reason Bosh The least thing does it

I flicked the ash from my cigar

It may I remarked affect you in this extraordinary way but surely
it is not so with most people

Perhaps not George conceded Most people are coldblooded asses

Very likely the explanation lies in that fact said I

I didnt mean you old chap said George with a penitence which
showed that he had meant me

Oh all right all right said I

But when a mans really far gone theres nothing else in the world but
it

That seems to me not to be a healthy condition said I

Healthy Oh you old idiot Sam Whos talking of health Now only
last night I met her at a dance I had five dances with hertalked to
her half the evening in fact Well youd think that would last some
time wouldnt you

I should certainly have supposed so I assented

So it would with most chaps I dare say but with meconfound it I
feel as if I hadnt seen her for six months

But my dear George thats surely rather absurd As you tell me you
spent a long while with the young person

Theyoung person

Youve not told me her name you see

No and I shant I wonder if shell be at the Musgraves tonight

Youre sure said I soothingly to meet her somewhere in the course
of the next few weeks

George looked at me Then he observed with a bitter laugh

Its pretty evident youve never had it Youre as bad as those chaps
who write books

Well but surely they often describe with sufficient warmth
andercolor

Oh I dare say but its all wrong At least its not what I feel
Then look at the girls in books All beasts

George spoke with much vehemence so that I was led to say

The lady you are preoccupied with is I suppose handsome

George turned swiftly round on me

Look here can you hold your tongue Sam

I nodded

Then Im hanged if I wont point her out to you

Thats uncommon good of you George said I

Then youll see continued George But its not only her looks you
know shes the most

He stopped Looking round to see why I observed that his face was red
he clutched his walking stick tightly in his left hand his right hand
was trembling as if it wanted to jump up to his hat Here she comes
Look look he whispered

Directing my eyes towards the lines of carriages which rolled past us
I observed a girl in a victoria by her side sat a portly lady of middle
age The girl was decidedly like the lady a description of the lady
would not I imagine be interesting The girl blushed slightly and
bowed George and I lifted our hats The victoria and its occupants were
gone George leant back with a sigh After a moment he said

Well that was her

There was expectancy in his tone

She has an extremely prepossessing appearance I observed

There isnt said George a girl in London to touch her Sam old
boy I believeI believe she likes me a bit

Im sure she must George said I and indeed I thought so

The Governors infernally unreasonable said George fretfully

Oh youve mentioned it to him

I sounded him Oh you may be sure he didnt see what I was up to I
put it quite generally He talked rot about getting on in the world Who
wants to get on

Who indeed said I It is only changing what you are for something
no better

And about waiting till I know my own mind Isnt it enough to look at
her

Ample in my opinion said I

George rose to his feet

Theyve gone to a party they wont come round again said he We may
as well go maynt we

I was very comfortable so I said timidly

We might see somebody else we know

Oh somebody else be hanged Who wants to see em

Im sure I dont said I hastily as I rose from my armchair which
was at once snapped up

We were about to return to the club when I observed Lady Micklehams
barouche standing under the trees I invited George to come and be
introduced

He displayed great indifference

She gives a good many parties said I and perhaps

By Jove Yes I may as well said George Glad you had the sense to
think of that old man

So I took him up to Dolly and presented him Dolly was very gracious
George is an evidently presentable boy We fell into conversation

My cousin Lady Mickleham said I has been telling me

Oh shut up Sam said George not however appearing very angry

About a subject on which you can assist him more than I can inasmuch
as you are married He is in love

Dolly glanced at George

Oh what fun said she

Fun cried George

I mean how awfully interesting said Dolly suddenly transforming her
expression

And he wanted to be introduced to you because you might ask her and him
to

George became red and began to stammer an apology

Oh I dont believe him said Dolly kindly he always makes people
uncomfortable if he can What were you telling him Mr George

Its no use telling him anything He cant understand said George

Is she very asked Dolly fixing doubtfully grave eyes on my young
cousin

Sams seen her said he in an excess of shyness

Dolly turned to me for an opinion and I gave one

She is just said I as charming as he thinks her

Dolly leant over to my cousin and whispered Tell me her name And he
whispered something back to Dolly

Its awfully kind of you Lady Mickleham he said

I am a kind old thing said Dolly all over dimples I can easily get
to know them

Oh you really are awfully kind Lady Mickleham

Dolly smiled upon him waved her hand to me and drove off crying

Do try to make Mr Carter understand

We were left along George wore a meditative smile Presently he roused
himself to say

Shes really a very kind woman Shes so sympathetic Shes not like
you I expect she felt it once herself you know

One can never tell said I carelessly Perhaps she didonce

George fell to brooding again I thought I would try an experiment

Not altogether badlooking either is she I asked lighting a
cigarette

George started

What Oh well I dont know I suppose some people might think so

He paused and added with a bashful knowing smile

You can hardly expect me to go into raptures about her can you old
man

I turned my head away but he caught me

Oh you neednt smile in that infernally patronizing way he cried
angrily

Upon my word George said I I dont know that I need




THE VERY LATEST THING

Its the very latest thing said Lady Mickleham standing by the table
in the smoking room and holding an album in her hand

I wish it had been a little later still said I for I felt
embarrassed

You promise on your honor to be absolutely sincere you know and
then you write what you think of me See what a lot of opinions Ive got
already and she held up the thick album

It would be extremely interesting to read them I observed

Oh but theyre quite confidential said Dolly Thats part of the
fun

I dont appreciate that part said I

Perhaps you will when youve written yours suggested Lady Mickleham

Meanwhile maynt I see the Dowagers

Well Ill show you a little bit of the Dowagers Look here Our dear
Dorothea is still perhaps just a thought wanting in seriousness but the
sense of her position is having a sobering effect

I hope not I exclaimed apprehensively Whose is this

Archies

May I see a bit

Not a bit said Dolly Archies isis rather foolish Mr Carter

So I suppose said I

Dear boy said Dolly reflectively

I hate sentiment said I Heres a long one Who wrote

Oh you mustnt look at thatnot at that above all

Why above all I asked with some severity

Dolly smiled then she observed in a soothing tone

Perhaps it wont be above all when youve written yours Mr Carter

By the way I said carelessly I suppose Archie sees all of them

He has never asked to see them answered Lady Mickleham

The reply seemed satisfactory of course Archie had only to ask I took
a clean quill and prepared to write

You promise to be sincere you know Dolly reminded me

I laid down my pen

Impossible said I firmly

O but why Mr Carter

There would be an end of our friendship

Do you think as badly of me as all that asked Dolly with a rueful
air

I leant back in my chair and looked at Dolly She looked at me She
smiled I may have smiled

Yes said I

Then you neednt write it quite all down said Dolly

I am obliged said I taking up my pen

You mustnt say what isnt true but you neednt say everything that
isthat might betrue explained Dolly

This again seemed satisfactory I began to write Dolly sitting
opposite me with her elbows on the table and watching me

After ten minutes steady work which included several pauses for
reflection I threw down the pen leant back in my chair and lit a
cigarette

Now read it said Dolly her chin in her hands and her eyes fixed on
me

It is on the whole I observed complimentary

No really said Dolly Yet you promised to be sincere

You would not have had me disagreeable I asked

Thats a different thing said Dolly Read it please

Lady Mickleham I read is usually accounted a person of considerable
attractions She is widely popular and more than one woman has been
known to like her

I dont quite understand that interrupted Dolly

It is surely simple said I and I read on without delay She is
kind even to her husband and takes the utmost pains to conceal from her
motherinlaw anything calculated to distress that lady

I suppose you mean that to be nice said Dolly

Of course I answered and I proceeded She never gives pain to any
one except with the object of giving pleasure to somebody else and her
kindness is no less widely diffused than it is hearty and sincere

That really is nice said Dolly smiling

Thank you said I smiling also She is very charitable she takes a
pleasure in encouraging the shy and bashful

How do you know that asked Dolly

While I pursued suffering without impatience a considerable amount
of selfassurance

You cant know whether Im patient or not remarked Dolly Im
polite

She thinks I read on no evil of the most attractive of women and
has a smile for the most unattractive of men

You put that very nicely said Dolly nodding

The former may constantly be seen in her houseand the latter at least
as often as many people would think desirable Here for some reason
Dolly laughed Her intellectual powers are not despicable

Thank you Mr Carter

She can say what she means on the occasions on which she wishes to do
so and she is at other times equally capable of meaning much more
than she would be likely to say

How do you mean that Mr Carter please

It explains itself said I and I proceeded The fact of her
receiving a remark with disapprobation does not necessarily mean that it
causes her displeasure nor must it be assumed that she did not expect a
visitor merely on the ground that she greets him with surprise

Here I observed Lady Mickleham looking at me rather suspiciously

I dont think thats quite nice of you Mr Carter she said
pathetically

Lady Mickleham is in short I went on coming to my peroration
equally deserving of esteem and affection

Esteem and affection That sounds just right said Dolly approvingly

And those who have been admitted to the enjoyment of her friendship are
unanimous in discouraging all others from seeking a similar privilege

I beg your pardon cried Lady Mickleham

Are unanimous I repeated slowly and distinctly in discouraging all
others from seeking a similar privilege

Dolly looked at me with her brow slightly puckered I leant back
puffing at my cigarette Presentlyfor there was quite a long
pauseDollys lips curved

My mental powers are not despicable she observed

I have said so said I

I think I see she remarked

Is there anything wrong I asked anxiously

Nno said Dolly not exactly wrong In fact I rather think I like
that last bit best Still dont you think

She rose came round the table took up the pen and put it back in my
hand Whats this for I asked

To correct the mistake said Dolly

Do you really think so said I

Im afraid so said Dolly

I took the pen and made a certain alteration Dolly took up the album

Are unanimous she read in encouraging all others to seek a
similar privilege Yes you meant that you know Mr Carter

I suppose I must have said I rather sulkily

The other was nonsense urged Dolly

Oh utter nonsense said I

And you had to write the truth

Yes I had to write some of it

And nonsense cant be the truth can it Mr Carter

Of course it cant Lady Mickleham

Where are you going Mr Carter she asked for I rose from my chair

To have a quiet smoke said I

Alone asked Dolly

Yes alone said I

I walked towards the door Dolly stood by the table fingering the album
I had almost reached the door then I happened to look round

Mr Carter said Dolly as though a new idea had struck her

What is it Lady Mickleham

Well you know Mr Carter II shall try to forget that mistake of
yours

Youre very kind Lady Mickleham

But said Dolly with a troubled smile IIm quite afraid I shant
succeed Mr Carter

After all the smoking room is meant for smoking




AN UNCOUNTED HOUR

We were standing Lady Mickleham and I at a door which led from the
morning room to the terrace at The Towers I was on a visit to the
historic pile by Vanbrughout of the money accumulated by the third
EarlPaymaster to the Forcestemp Queen Anne The morning room is
a large room Archie was somewhere in it Lady Mickleham held a jar
containing pate de foie gras from time to time she dug a piece out with
a fork and flung the morsel to a big retriever which was sitting on the
terrace The morning was fine but cloudy Lady Mickleham wore blue The
dog swallowed the pate with greediness

Its so bad for him sighed she but the dear likes it so much

How human the creatures are said I

Do you know pursued Lady Mickleham that the Dowager says Im
extravagant She thinks dogs ought not to be fed on pate de foie gras

Your extravagance I observed is probably due to your having been
brought up on a moderate income I have felt the effect myself

Of course said Dolly we are hit by the agricultural depression

The Carters also I murmured are landed gentry

After all I dont see much point in economy do you Mr Carter

Economy I remarked putting my hands in my pockets is going without
something you do want in case you should some day want something which
you probably wont want

Isnt that clever asked Dolly in an apprehensive tone

Oh dear no I answered reassuringly Anybody can do thatif they
care to try you know

Dolly tossed a piece of pate to the retriever

I have made a discovery lately I observed

What are you two talking about called Archie

Youre not meant to hear said Dolly without turning round

Yet if its a discovery he ought to hear it

Hes made a good many lately said Dolly

She dug out the last bit of pate flung it to the dog and handed the
empty pot to me

Dont be so allegorical I implored Besides its really not just to
Archie No doubt the dog is a nice one but

How foolish you are this morning Whats the discovery

An entirely surprising one

Oh but let me hear Its nothing about Archie is it

No Ive told you all Archies sins

Nor Mrs Hilary I wish it was Mrs Hilary

Shall we walk on the terrace I suggested

Oh yes lets said Dolly stepping out and putting on a
broadbrimmed lowcrowned hat which she caught up from a chair hard
by It isnt Mrs Hilary she added sitting down on a garden seat

No said I leaning on a sundial which stood by the seat

Well what is it

It is simple said I and serious It is not therefore like you
Lady Mickleham

Its like Mrs Hilary said Dolly

No because it isnt pleasant By the way you are jealous of Mrs
Hilary

Dolly said nothing at all She took off her hat roughened her hair a
little and assumed an effective pose Still it is a fact for what it
is worth that she doesnt care much about Mrs Hilary

The discovery I continued is that Im growing middleaged

You are middleaged said Dolly spearing her hat with its long pin

I was very naturally nettled at this

So will you be soon I retorted

Not soon said Dolly

Some day I insisted

After a pause of about half a minute Dolly said I suppose so

You will become I pursued idly drawing patterns with my finger on
the sundial wrinkled rough fatand perhaps good

Youre very disagreeable today said Dolly

She rose and stood by me

What do the mottoes mean she asked

There were two I will not say they contradicted one another but they
looked at life from different points of view

Pereunt et imputantur I read

Well whats that Mr Carter

A trite but offensive assertion said I lighting a cigarette

But what does it mean she asked a pucker on her forehead

What does it matter said I Lets try the other

The other is longer

And better Horas non numero nisi serenas

And whats that

I translated literally Dolly clapped her hands and her face gleamed
with smiles

I like that one she cried

Stop said I imperatively Youll set it moving

Its very sensible said she

More freely rendered it means I live only when you

By Jove remarked Archie coming up behind us pipe in mouth there
was a lot of rain last night Ive just measured it in the gauge

Some people measure everything said I with a displeased air It is
a detestable habit

Archie what does Pereunt et imputantur mean

Eh Oh I see Well I say CarterOh well you know I suppose it
means youve got to pay for your fun doesnt it

Oh is that all I was afraid it was something horrid Why did you
frighten me Mr Carter

I think it is rather horrid said I

Why it isnt even true said Dolly scornfully

Now when I heard this ancient and respectable legend thus cavalierly
challenged I fell to studying it again and presently I exclaimed

Yes youre right If it said that it wouldnt be true but Archie
translated it wrong

Well you have a shot suggested Archie

The oysters are eaten and put down in the bill said I And you will
observe Archie that it does not say in whose bill

Ah said Dolly

Well somebodys got to pay persisted Archie

Oh yes somebody laughed Dolly

Well I dont know said Archie I suppose the chap that has the
fun

Its not always a chap observed Dolly

Well then the individual amended Archie I suppose hed have to
pay

It doesnt say so I remarked mildly And according to my small
experience

Im quite sure your meaning is right Mr Carter said Dolly in an
authoritative tone

As for the other motto Archie said I it merely means that a woman
considers all hours wasted which she does not spend in the society of
her husband

Oh come you dont gammon me said Archie It means that the sun
dont shine unless its fine you know

Archie delivered this remarkable discovery in a tone of great self
satisfaction

Oh you dear old thing said Dolly

Well it does you know said he

There was a pause Archie kissed his wife I am not complaining he has
of course a perfect right to kiss his wife and strolled away toward
the hothouses

I lit another cigarette Then Dolly pointing to the stem of the dial
cried

Why heres another inscriptionoh and in English

She was right There was anothercarelessly scratched on the old
battered columnnearly effaced for the characters had been but lightly
markedand yet not as I conceived from the tenor of the words very
old

What is it asked Dolly peering over my shoulder as I bent down to
read the letters and shading her eyes with her hand Why didnt she
put on her hat We touch the Incomprehensible

It is said I a singularly poor shallow feeble and undesirable
little verse

Read it out said Dolly

So I read it The silly fellow had written

Life is Love the poets tell us In the little books they sell us But
pray maamwhats of Life the Use If Life be Love For Loves the
Deuce

Dolly began to laugh gently digging the pin again into her hat

I wonder she said whether they used to come and sit by this old
dial just as we did this morning

I shouldnt be at all surprised said I And another point occurs to
me Lady Mickleham

Oh does it Whats that Mr Carter

Do you think that anybody measured the rain gauge

Dolly looked at me very gravely

Im so sorry when you do that said she pathetically

I smiled

I really am said dolly But you dont mean it do you

Certainly not said I

Dolly smiled

No more than he did said I pointing to the sun dial

And then we both smiled

Will this hour count Mr Carter asked Dolly as she turned away

That would be rather strict said I




A REMINISCENCE

I know exactly what your mother wants Phyllis observed Mrs Hilary

Its just to teach them the ordinary things said little Miss Phyllis

What are the ordinary things I ventured to ask

What all girls are taught of course Mr Carter said Mrs Hilary
Ill write about it at once And she looked at me as if she thought
that I might be about to go

It is a comprehensive curriculum I remarked crossing my legs if
one may judge from the results How old are your younger sisters Miss
Phyllis

Fourteen and sixteen she answered

It is a pity said I that this didnt happen a little while back I
knew a governess who would have suited the place to a t

Mrs Hilary smiled scornfully

We used to meet I continued

Who used to meet asked Miss Phyllis

The governess and myself to be sure said I under the old apple
tree in the garden at the back of the house

What house Mr Carter

My fathers house of course Miss Phyllis And

Oh but that must be ages ago cried she

Mrs Hilary rose cast one glance at me and turned to the writing
table Her pen began to scratch almost immediately

And under the apple tree I pursued we had many pleasant
conversations

What about asked Miss Phyllis

One thing and another I returned The schoolroom windows looked
out that waya circumstance which made matters more comfortable for
everybody

I should have thought began Miss Phyllis smiling slightly but
keeping an apprehensive eye on Mrs Hilarys back

Not at all I interrupted My sisters saw us you see Well of
course they entertained an increased respect for me which was all
right and a decreased respect for the governess which was also all
right We met in the hour allotted to French lessonsby an undesigned
but appropriate coincidence

I shall say about thirtyfive Phyllis called Mrs Hilary from the
writing table

Yes Cousin Mary called Miss Phyllis Did you meet often Mr
Carter

Every evening in the French hour said I

Shell have got over any nonsense by then called Mrs Hilary They
are often full of it

She had remarkably pretty hair I continued very soft it was Dear
me I was just twenty

How old was she asked Miss Phyllis

Ones first love said I is never any age Everything went very
well Happiness was impossible I was heartbroken and the governess was
far from happy Ah happy happy times

But you dont seem to have been happy objected Miss Phyllis

Then came a terrible evening

She ought to be a person of active habits called Mrs Hilary

I think so yes Cousin Mary oh what happened Mr Carter

And an early riser added Mrs Hilary

Yes Cousin Mary What did happen Mr Carter

My mother came in during the French hour I dont know whether you
have observed Miss Phyllis how easy it is to slip into the habit of
entering rooms when you had better remain outside Now even my friend
ArchHowever thats neither here nor there My mother as I say came
in

Church of England of course Phyllis called Mrs Hilary

Oh of course cousin Mary cried little Miss Phyllis

The sect makes no difference I observed Well my sisters like good
girls began to repeat the irregular verbs But it was no use We were
discovered That night Miss Phyllis I nearly drowned myself

You must have beenOh how awful Mr Carter

That is to say I thought how effective it would be if I drowned
myself Ah well it couldnt last

And the governess

She left next morning

There was a pause Miss Phyllis looked sad and thoughtful I smiled
pensively and beat my cane against my leg

Have you ever seen her since asked Miss Phyllis

No

Shouldntshouldnt you like to Mr Carter

Heaven forbid said I

Suddenly Mrs Hilary pushed back her chair and turned round to us

Well I declare said she I must be growing stupid Here have I
been writing to the Agency when I know of the very thing myself The
Polwheedles governess is just leaving them shes been there over
fifteen years Lady Polwheedle told me she was a treasure I wonder if
shed go

Is she what mamma wants

My dear youll be most lucky to get her Ill write at once and ask
her to come to lunch tomorrow I met her there Shes an admirable
person

Mrs Hilary wheeled round again I shook my head at Miss Phyllis

Poor children said I Manage a bit of fun for them sometimes

Miss Phyllis assumed a staid and virtuous air

They must be properly brought up Mr Carter said she

Is there a House Opposite I asked and Miss Phyllis blushed

Mrs Hilary advanced holding out a letter

You may as well post this for me said she Oh and would you like to
come to lunch tomorrow

To meet the Paragon

No Shell be there of course but you see its Saturday and Hilary
will be here and I thought you might take him off somewhere and leave
Phyllis and me to have a quiet talk with her

That wont amuse her much I ventured to remark

Shes not coming to be amused said Mrs Hilary severely

All right Ill come said I taking my hat

Heres the note for Miss Bannerman said Mrs Hilary

That sort of thing never surprises me I looked at the letter and read
Miss M E Bannerman M E stood for Maud Elizabeth I put my hat
back on the table

What sort of a looking person is this Miss Bannerman I asked

Oh a spare upright womanhair a little gray andI dont know
how to describe ither face looks a little weatherbeaten She wears
glasses

Thank you said I And what sort of a looking person am I

Mrs Hilary looked scornful Miss Phyllis opened her eyes

How old do I look Miss Phyllis I asked

I dont know she said uncomfortably

Guess said I sternly

Ffortythreeoh or fortytwo she asked with a timid upward
glance

When youve done your nonsense began Mrs Hilary but I laid a hand
on her arm

Should you call me fat I asked

Oh no not fat said Mrs Hilary with a smile which she strove to
render reassuring

I am undoubtedly bald I observed

Youre certainly bald said Mrs Hilary with regretful candor

I took my hat and remarked A man has a right to think of himself but
I am not thinking mainly of myself I shall not come to lunch

You said you would cried Mrs Hilary indignantly

I poised the letter in my hand reading again Miss Maud Elizabeth
Bannerman Miss Phyllis looked at me curiously Mrs Hilary
impatiently

Who knows said I that I may not be a Romancea Vanished Dreama
Green Memoryan Oasis A person who has the fortune to be an Oasis
Miss Phyllis should be very careful I will not come to lunch

Do you mean that you used to know Miss Bannerman asked Mrs Hilary in
her pleasant prosaic way

It was a sin seventeen years old it would hardly count against the
blameless Miss Bannerman now You may tell her when Im gone said I
to Miss Phyllis

Miss Phyllis whispered in Mrs Hilarys ear

Another cried Mrs Hilary aghast

It was the very first said I defending myself

Mrs Hilary began to laugh I smoothed my hat

Tell her said I that I remembered her very well

I shall do no such thing said Mrs Hilary

And tell her I continued that I am still handsome

I shant say a word about you said Mrs Hilary

Ah well that will be better still said I

Shell have forgotten your very name remarked Mrs Hilary

I opened the door but a thought struck me I turned round and observed

I dare say her hairs just as soft as ever StillIll lunch some
other day




A VERY FINE DAY

I see nothing whatever to laugh at said Mrs Hilary coldly when I
had finished

I did not ask you to laugh I observed mildly I mentioned it merely
as a typical case

Its not typical she said and took up her embroidery But a moment
later she added

Poor boy Im not surprised

Im not surprised either I remarked It is however extremely
deplorable

Its your own fault Why did you introduce him

A book I observed might be written on the Injustice of the Just
How could I suppose that he would

By the way I might as well state what hethat is my young cousin
Georgehad done Unless one is a genius it is best to aim at being
intelligible

Well he was in love and with a view of providing him with another
house at which he might be likely to meet the adored object I presented
him to my friend Lady Mickleham That was on a Tuesday A fortnight
later as I was sitting in Hyde Park as I sometimes do George came
up and took the chair next to me I gave him a cigarette but made no
remark George beat his cane restlessly against the leg of his trousers

Ive got to go up tomorrow he remarked

Ah well Oxford is a delightful town said I

Dd hole observed George

I was about to contest this opinion when a victoria drove by

A girl sat in it side by side with a portly lady

George George I cried There she isLook

George looked raised his hat with sufficient politeness and remarked
to me

Hang it one sees those people everywhere

I am not easily surprised but I confess I turned to George with an
expression of wonder

A fortnight ago I began

Dont be an ass Sam said George rather sharply Shes not a bad
girl but He broke off and began to whistle There was a long pause
I lit a cigar and looked at the people

I lunched at the Micklehams today said George drawing a figure on
the gravel with his cane Micklehams not a bad fellow

One of the best fellows alive I agreed

I wonder why she married him though mused George and he added with
apparent irrelevance Its a dashed bore going up And then a smile
spread over his face a blush accompanied it and proclaimed Georges
sense of delicious wickedness I turned on him

Out with it I said

Its nothing Dont be a fool said George

Where did you get that rose I asked

This rose he repeated fondling the blossom It was given to me

Upon this I groanedand I still consider that I had good reason for my
action It was the groan of a moralist

Theyve asked me to stay at The Towers next vac said George
glancing at me out of the corner of an immoral eye Perhaps he thought
it too immoral for he added Its all right Sam I believe that I
have as much self control as most people but at this point I chuckled

What the deuce are you laughing at asked George

I made no answer and he went on

You never told me what awhat she was like Sam Wanted to keep it to
yourself you old dog

GeorgeGeorgeGeorge said I You go up tomorrow

Yes confound it

And term lasts two months

Yes hang it

All is well said I crossing my legs There is more virtue in two
months than in Ten Commandments

George regarded me with a dispassionate air

Youre an awful ass sometimes he observed critically and he rose
from his seat

Must you go said I

Yesgot a lot of things to do Look here Sam dont go and talk
about

Talk about what

Anything you old idiot said George with a pleased smile and he dug
me in the ribs with his cane and departed

I sat on admiring the simple elements which constitute the happiness of
the young Alas With advancing years Wrong loses half its flavor To
be improper ceases by itself to satisfy

Immersed in these reflections I failed to notice that a barouche had
stopped opposite to me and suddenly I found a footman addressing me

Beg your pardon sir he said Her ladyship wishes to speak to you

It is a blessed thing to be young Martin I observed

Yes sir said Martin Its a fine day sir

But very short said I Martin is respectful and said nothingto me
at least What he said to the coachman I dont know

And then I went up to Dolly

Get in and drive round suggested Dolly

I cant said I I have a bad nose

Whats the matter with your nose asked Dolly smiling

The joint is injured said I getting into the barouche And I added
severely I suppose Id better sit with my back to the horses

Oh no youre not my husband said Dolly Sit here and she made
room by her as she continued I rather like Mr George

Im ashamed of you I observed Considering your age

Mr Carter

Considering I say his age your conduct is scandalous I shall never
introduce any nice boys to you again

Oh please do said Dolly clasping her hands

You give them roses said I accusingly You make them false to their
earliest loves

She was a puddingfaced thing observed Dolly

I frowned Dolly by an accident allowed the tip of her finger to touch
my arm for an instant

Hes a nice boy said she How like he is to you Mr Carter

I am a long way past that said I I am thirtysix

If you mean to be disagreeable said she turning away I beg your
pardon for touching you Mr Carter

I did not notice it Lady Mickleham

Would you like to get out

Its miles from my club said I discontentedly

Hes such fun said Dolly with a sudden smile He told Archie that I
was the most charming woman in London Youve never done that

He said the same about the puddingfaced girl I observed

There was a pause Then Dolly asked

How is your nose

The carriage exercise is doing it good said I

If observed Dolly he is so silly now what will he be at your
age

A wise man said I

He suggested that I might write to him bubbled Dolly

Now when Dolly bubblesan operation which includes a sudden turn
towards me a dancing of eyes a dart of a small hand a hurried rush of
words checked and confused by a speedier gust of gurgling soundI am
in the habit of ceasing to argue the question Bubbling is not to be met
by arguing I could only say

Hell have forgotten by the end of the term

Hell remember two days later retorted Dolly

Stop the carriage said I I shall tell Mrs Hilary all about it

I wont stop the carriage said Dolly Im going to take you home with
me

I am at a premium today I said sardonically

One must have something said Dolly How is your nose now Mr
Carter

I looked at Dolly I had better not have done that

Would afternoon tea hurt it she inquired anxiously

It would do it good said I decisively

And that is absolutely the whole story And what in the world Mrs
Hilary found to disapprove of I dont knowespecially as I didnt tell
her half of it But she did disapprove However she looks very well
when she disapproves




THE HOUSE OPPOSITE

We were talking over the sad case of young Algy Groom I was explaining
to Mrs Hilary exactly what had happened

His father gave him said I a hundred pounds to keep him for three
months in Paris while he learnt French

And very liberal too said Mrs Hilary

It depends where you dine said I However that question did not
arise for Algy went to the Grand Prix the day after he arrived

A horse race asked Mrs Hilary with great contempt

Certainly the competitors are horses I rejoined And there he most
unfortunately lost the whole sum without learning any French to speak
of

How disgusting exclaimed Mrs Hilary and little Miss Phyllis gasped
in horror

Oh well said Hilary with much bravery as it struck me his
fathers very well off

That doesnt make it a bit better declared his wife

Theres no mortal sin in a little betting my dear Boys will be
boys

And even that I interposed wouldnt matter if we could only prevent
girls from being girls

Mrs Hilary taking no notice whatever of me pronounced sentence He
grossly deceived his father she said and took up her embroidery

Most of us have grossly deceived our parents before now said I We
should all have to confess to something of the sort

I hope youre speaking for your own sex observed Mrs Hilary

Not more than yours said I You used to meet Hilary on the pier when
your father wasnt thereyou told me so

Father had authorized my acquaintance with Hilary

I hate quibbles said I

There was a pause Mrs Hilary stitched Hilary observed that the day
was fine

Now I pursued carelessly even Miss Phyllis here has been known to
deceive her parents

Oh let the poor child alone anyhow said Mrs Hilary

Havent you said I to Miss Phyllis

I expected an indignant denial So did Mrs Hilary for she remarked
with a sympathetic air

Never mind his folly Phyllis dear

Havent you Miss Phyllis said I

Miss Phyllis grew very red Fearing that I was causing her pain I was
about to observe on the prospects of a Dissolution when a shy smile
spread over Miss Phylliss face

Yes once said she with a timid glance at Mrs Hilary who
immediately laid down her embroidery

Out with it I cried triumphantly Come along Miss Phyllis We
wont tell honor bright

Miss Phyllis looked again at Mrs Hilary Mrs Hilary is human

Well Phyllis dear said she after all this time I shouldnt think
it my duty

It only happened last summer said Miss Phyllis

Mrs Hilary looked rather put out

Still she began

We must have the story said I

Little Miss Phyllis put down the sock she had been knitting

I was very naughty she remarked It was my last term at school

I know that age said I to Hilary

My window looked out towards the street Youre sure you wont tell
Well there was a house opposite

And a young man in it said I

How did you know that asked Miss Phyllis blushing immensely

No girls school can keep up its numbers without one I explained

Well there was anyhow said Miss Phyllis And I and two other girls
went to a course of lectures at the Town Hall on literature or something
of that kind We used to have a shilling given us for our tickets

Precisely said I A hundred pounds

No a shilling corrected Miss Phyllis A hundred pounds How absurd
Mr Carter Well one day II

Youre sure you wish to go on Phyllis asked Mrs Hilary

Youre afraid Mrs Hilary said I severely

Nonsense Mr Carter I thought Phyllis might

I dont mind going on said Miss Phyllis smiling One day II lost
the other girls

The other girls are always easy to lose I observed

And on the way thereoh you know he went to the lectures

The young dog said I nudging Hilary I should think he did

On the way there it became ratherrather foggy

Blessings on it I cried for little Miss Phylliss demure but roguish
expression delighted me

And hehe found me in the fog

What are you doing Mr Carter cried Mrs Hilary angrily

Nothing nothing said I I believe I had winked at Hilary

Andwe couldnt find the Town Hall

Oh Phyllis groaned Mrs Hilary

Little Miss Phyllis looked alarmed for a moment Then she smiled

But we found the confectioners said she

The Grand Prix said I pointing my forefinger at Hilary

He had no money at all said Miss Phyllis

Its ideal said I

Andand we had tea onon

The shilling I cried in rapture

Yes said little Miss Phyllis on the shilling And he saw me home

Details please said I

Little Miss Phyllis shook her head

And left me at the door

Was it still foggy I asked

Yes Or he wouldnt have

Now what did he

Come to the door Mr Carter said Miss Phyllis with obvious
wariness Oh and it was such fun

Im sure it was

No I mean when we were examined in the lectures I bought the local
paper you know and read it up and I got top marks easily and Miss
Green wrote to mother to say how well I had done

It all ends most satisfactorily I observed

Yes didnt it said little Miss Phyllis

Mrs Hilary was grave again

And you never told your mother Phyllis she asked

Nno Cousin Mary said Miss Phyllis

I rose and stood with my back to the fire Little Miss Phyllis took up
her sock again but a smile still played about the corners of her mouth

I wonder said I looking up at the ceiling what happened at the
door Then as no one spoke I added

Pooh I know what happened at the door

Im not going to tell you anything more said Miss Phyllis

But I should like to hear it in your own

Miss Phyllis was gone She had suddenly risen and run from the room

It did happen at the door said I

Fancy Phyllis mused Mrs Hilary

I hope said I that it will be a lesson to you

I shall have to keep my eye on her said Mrs Hilary

You cant do it said I in easy confidence I had no fear of little
Miss Phyllis being done out of her recreations Meanwhile I pursued
the important thing is this my parallel is obvious and complete

Theres not the least likeness said Mrs Hilary sharply

As a hundred pounds are to a shilling so is the Grand Prix to the
young man opposite I observed taking my hat and holding out my hand
to Mrs Hilary

I am very angry with you she said Youve made the child think there
was nothing wrong in it

Oh Nonsense said I Look how she enjoyed telling it

Then not heeding Mrs Hilary I launched into an apostrophe

O divine House Opposite I cried Charming House Opposite If only
I might dwell forever in the House Opposite

I havent the least notion of what you mean remarked Mrs Hilary
stiffly I suppose its something sillyor worse

I looked at her in some puzzle

Have you no longing for the House Opposite I asked

Mrs Hilary looked at me Her eyes ceased to be absolutely blank She
put her arm through Hilarys and answered gently

I dont want the House Opposite

Ah said I giving my hat a brush but maybe you remember the
Housewhen it was Opposite

Mrs Hilary one arm still in Hilarys gave me her hand She blushed
and smiled

Well said she it was your fault so I wont scold Phyllis

No dont my dear said Hilary with a laugh

As for me I went downstairs and in absence of mind bade my cabman
drive to the House Opposite But I have never got there




A QUICK CHANGE

Why not go with Archie I asked spreading out my hands

It will be dull enough anyhow said Dolly fretfully Besides its
awfully bourgeois to go to the theater with ones husband

Bourgeois I observed is an epithet which the riffraff apply to what
is respectable and the aristocracy to what is decent

But its not a nice thing to be all the same said Dolly who is
impervious to the most penetrating remark

Youre in no danger of it I hastened to assure her

How should you describe me then she asked leaning forward with a
smile

I should describe you Lady Mickleham I replied discreetly as being
a little lower than the angels

Dollys smile was almost a laugh as she asked

How much lower please Mr Carter

Just by the depth of your dimples said I thoughtlessly

Dolly became immensely grave

I thought said she that we never mentioned them now Mr Carter

Did we ever I asked innocently

I seemed to remember once do you recollect being in very low spirits
one evening at Monte

I remember being in very low water more than one evening there

Yes you told me you were terribly hardup

There was an election in our division that year I remarked and I
remitted 30 percent of my rents

You didto M Blanc said Dolly Oh and you were very dreary You
said youd wasted your life and your time and your opportunities

Oh you mustnt suppose I never have any proper feelings said I
complacently

I think you were hardly yourself

Do be more charitable

And you said that your only chance was in gaining the affection of

Surely I was not such anso foolish I implored

Yes you were You were sitting close by me

Oh then it doesnt count said I rallying a little

On a bench You remember the bench

No I dont said I with a kind but firm smile

Not the bench

No

Dolly looked at me then she asked in an insinuating tone

When did you forget it Mr Carter

The day you were buried I rejoined

I see Well you said then what you couldnt possibly have meant

I dare say I often did

That they were

That what were

Why thethewhat were talking about

What we were Oh to be sure thethe blemishes

Yes the blemishes You said they were the most

Oh well it was a facon de parler

I was afraid you werent a bit sincere said Dolly humbly

Well judge by yourself said I with a candid air

But I said nothing cried Dolly

It was incomparably the most artistic thing to do said I

Im sometimes afraid you dont do me justice Mr Carter remarked
Dolly with some pathos

I did not care to enter upon that discussion and a pause followed Then
Dolly in a timid manner asked me

Do you remember the dreadful thing that happened the same evening

That chances to remain in my memory I admitted

Ive always thought it kind of you never to speak of it said she

It is best forgotten said I smiling

We should have said the same about anybody protested Dolly

Certainly We were only trying to be smart said I

And it was horribly unjust

I quite agree with you Lady Mickleham

Besides I didnt know anything about him then He had only arrived
that day you see

Really we were not to blame I urged

Oh but doesnt it seem funny

A strange whirligig no doubt I mused

There was a pause Then the faintest of smiles appeared on Dollys face

He shouldnt have worn such clothes she said as though in self
defense Anybody would have looked absurd in them

It was all the clothes I agreed Besides when a man doesnt know a
place he always moons about and looks

Yes Rather awkward doesnt he Mr Carter

And the mere fact of his looking at you

At us please

Is nothing although we made a grievance of it at the time

That was very absurd of you said Dolly

It was certainly unreasonable of us said I

We ought have known he was a gentleman

But we scouted the idea of it said I

It was a most curious mistake to make said Dolly

O well its put right now said I

Oh Mr Carter do you remember mammas face when we described him

That was a terrible moment said I with a shudder

I said he wasugly whispered Dolly

And I saidsomething worse murmured I

And mamma knew at once from our description that it was

She saw it in a minute said I

And then you went away

Well I rather suppose I did said I

Mamma is just a little like the Dowager sometimes said Dolly

There is a touch now and then I conceded

And when I was introduced to him the next day I absolutely blushed

I dont altogether wonder at that I observed

But it wasnt as if hed heard what we were saying

No but hed seen what we were doing

Well what were we doing cried Dolly defiantly

Conversing confidentially said I

And a week later you went home

Just one week later said I

There was a long pause

Well youll take me to the theater asked Dolly with something
which if I were so disposed I might consider a sigh

Ive seen the piece twice said I

How tiresome of you Youve seen everything twice

Ive seen some things much oftener I observed

Ill get a nice girl for you to talk to and Ill have a young man

I dont want my girl to be too nice I observed

She shall be pretty said Dolly generously

I dont mind if I do come with you said I What becomes of Archie

Hes going to take his mother and his sisters to the Albert Hall

My face brightened

I am unreasonable I admitted

Sometimes you are said Dolly

I have much to be thankful for Have you ever observed a small boy eat
a penny ice

Of course I have said Dolly

What does he do when hes finished it

Stop I suppose

On the contrary said I he licks the glass

Yes he does said Dolly meditatively

Its not so badlicking the glass said I

Dolly stood opposite me smiling At this moment Archie entered He had
been working at his lathe He is very fond of making things which he
doesnt want and then giving them to people who have no use for them

How are you old chap he began Ive just finished an uncommon
pretty

He stopped paralyzed by a cry from Dolly

Archie what in the world are you wearing

I turned a startled gaze upon Archie

Its just an old suit I routed out said he apologetically

I looked at Dolly her eyes were closed shut and she gasped

My dear dear boy go and change it

I dont see why its not

Go and change it if you love me besought Dolly

Oh all right

You look hideous in it she said her eyes still shut

Archie who is very docile withdrew A guilty silence reigned for some
moments Then Dolly opened her eyes It was the suit she said with a
shudder Oh how it all came back to me

I could wish I observed taking my hat that it would all come back
to me

I wonder if you mean that

As much as I ever did said I earnestly

And that is

Quite enough

How tiresome you are she said turning away with a smile

Outside I met Archie in another suit

A quick change eh my boy said he

It took just a week I remarked absently

Archie stared




A SLIGHT MISTAKE

I dont ask you for more than a guinea said Mrs Hilary with a
parade of forbearance

It would be the same I replied politely if you asked me for a
thousand with which I handed her halfacrown She held it in her open
hand regarding it scornfully

Yes I continued taking a seat I feel that pecuniary gifts

Halfacrown

Are you a poor substitute for personal service May not I accompany you
to the ceremony

I dare say you spent as much as this on wine with your lunch

I was in a mad mood today I answered apologetically What are they
taught at the school

Above all to be good girls said Mrs Hilary earnestly What are you
sneering at Mr Carter

Nothing said I hastily and I added with a sigh I suppose its all
right

I should like said Mrs Hilary meditatively if I had not other
duties to dedicate my life to the service of girls

I should think twice about that if I were you said I shaking my
head

By the way Mr Carter I dont know if Ive ever spoken unkindly of
Lady Mickleham I hope not

Hope said I is not yet taxed

If I have Im very sorry Shes been most kind in undertaking to give
away the prizes today There must be some good in her

Oh dont be hasty I implored

I always wanted to think well of her

Ah Now I never did

And Lord Mickleham is coming too Hell be most useful

That settles it I exclaimed I may not be an earl but I have a
perfect right to be useful Ill go too

I wonder if youll behave properly said Mrs Hilary doubtfully

I held out a halfsovereign three halfcrowns and a shilling

Oh well you may come since Hilary cant said Mrs Hilary

You mean he wont I observed

He has always been prevented hitherto said she with dignity

So I went and it proved a most agreeable expedition There were 200
girls in blue frocks and white aprons the girl three from the end of
the fifth row was decidedly prettya nice lot of prize booksthe
Micklehams Dolly in demure black ourselves and the matron All went
well Dolly gave away the prizes Mrs Hilary and Archie made little
speeches Then the matron came to me I was sitting modestly at the back
of the platform a little distance behind the others

Mr Musgrave said the matron to me were so glad to see you here at
last Wont you say a few words

It would be a privilege I responded cordially but unhappily I have
a sore throat

The matron who was a most respectable woman said Dear dear but
did not press the point Evidently however she liked me for when we
went to have a cup of tea she got me in a corner and began to tell
me all about the work It was extremely interesting Then the matron
observed

And what an angel Mrs Musgrave is

Well I should hardly call her that said I with a smile

Oh you mustnt depreciate heryou of all men cried the matron
with a somewhat ponderous archness Really I envy you her constant
society

I assure you said I I see very little of her

I beg your pardon

I only go to the house about once a fortnightOh its not my fault
She wont have me there oftener

What do you mean I beg your pardon Perhaps Ive touched on a
painful

Not at all not at all said I suavely It is very natural I am
neither young nor handsome Mrs Wiggins I am not complaining

The matron gazed at me

Only seeing her here I pursued you have no idea of what she is at
home She has chosen to forbid me to come to her house

Her house

It happens to be more hers than mine I explained To forbid me I
say more than once to come to her house No doubt she had her reasons

Nothing could justify it said the matron directing a wondering
glance at Mrs Hilary

Do not let us blame her said I It is just an unfortunate accident
She is not as fond of me as I could wish Mrs Wiggins and she is a
great deal fonder than I could wish of

I broke off Mrs Hilary was walking toward us I think she was pleased
to see me getting on so well with the matron for she was smiling
pleasantly The matron wore a bewildered expression

I suppose said Mrs Hilary that youll drive back with the
Micklehams

Unless you want me said I keeping a watchful eye on the matron

Oh I dont want you said Mrs Hilary lightly

You wont be alone this evening I asked anxiously

Mrs Hilary stared a little

O no she said We shall have our usual party

May I come one day next week I asked humbly

Mrs Hilary thought for a moment

Im so busy next weekcome the week after said she giving me her
hand

Thats very unkind said I

Nonsense said Mrs Hilary and she added Mind you let me know when
youre coming

I wont surprise you I assured her with a covert glance at the
matron

The excellent woman was quite red in the face and could gasp out
nothing but Goodbye as Mrs Hilary affectionately pressed her hand

At this moment Dolly came up She was alone

Wheres Archie I asked

Hes run away hes got to meet somebody I knew youd see me home
Mrs Hilary didnt want you of course

Of course not said I plaintively

Besides youd rather come with me wouldnt you pursued Dolly and
she added pleasantly to the matron Mrs Hilarys so down on him you
know

Id much rather come with you said I

Well have a cozy drive all to ourselves said Dolly without
husbands or wives or anything horrid Isnt it nice to get rid of ones
husband sometimes Mrs Wiggins

I have the misfortune to be a widow Lady Mickleham said Mrs
Wiggins

Dollys eyes rested upon her with an interesting expression I knew that
she was about to ask Mrs Wiggins whether she liked the condition of
life and I interposed hastily with a sigh

But you can look back on a happy marriage Mrs Wiggins

I did my best to make it so said she stiffly

You are right said I Even in the face of unkindness we should
strive

My husbands not unkind said Dolly

I didnt mean your husband said I

What your poor wife would do if she cared a button for you I dont
know observed Dolly

If I had a wife who cared for me I should be a better man said I
solemnly

But youd probably be very dull said Dolly And you wouldnt be
allowed to drive with me

Perhaps its all for the best said I brightening up Goodbye Mrs
Wiggins

Dolly walked on Mrs Wiggins held my hand for a moment

Young man said she sternly are you sure its not your own fault

Im not at all sure Mrs Wiggins said I But dont be distressed
about it Its of no consequence I dont let it make me unhappy
Goodbye so many thanks Charming girls you have hereespecially that
one in the fifthI mean charming all of them Goodbye

I hastened to the carriage Mrs Wiggins stood and watched I got in and
sat down by Dolly

Oh Mrs Wiggins said Dolly dimpling dont tell Mrs Hilary that
Archie wasnt with us or we shall get into trouble And she added to
me Are you all right

Rather said I appreciatively and we drove off leaving Mrs Wiggins
on her doorstep

A fortnight later I went to call on Mrs Hilary After some conversation
she remarked

Im going to the school again tomorrow

Really said I

And Im so delightedIve persuaded Hilary to come

She paused and then added

You really seemed interested last time

Oh I was

Would you like to come again tomorrow

No I think not thanks said I carelessly

Thats just like you she said severely You never do any real good
because you never stick to anything

There are some things one cant stick to said I

Oh nonsense said Mrs Hilary

But there areand I didnt go




THE OTHER LADY

By the merest chance I observed meditatively I attended a reception
last night

I went to three said Lady Mickleham selecting a sardine sandwich
with care

I might not have gone I mused I might easily not have gone

I cant see what difference it would have made if you hadnt said
she

I thought three times about going Its a curious world

What happened You may smoke you know

I fell in love said I lighting a cigarette

Lady Mickleham placed her feet on the fenderit was a chilly
afternoonand turned her face to me shielding it from the fire with
her handkerchief

Men of your age she remarked have no business to be thinking of
such things

I was not thinking of it said I I was thinking of going home Then
I was introduced to her

And you stayed a little I suppose

I stayed two hoursor two minutesI forget which and I added
nodding my head at Lady Mickleham There was something irresistible
about me last night

Lady Mickleham laughed

You seem very pleased with yourself she said reaching for a fan to
replace the handkerchief

Yes take care of your complexion said I approvingly She has a
lovely complexion

Lady Mickleham laid down the fan

I am very pleased with myself I continued She was delighted with
me

I suppose you talked nonsense to her

I have not the least idea what I talked to her It was quite
immaterial The language of the eyes

Oh you might be a boy

I was said I nodding again

There was a long silence Dolly looked at me I looked at the fire I
did not however see the fire I saw something quite different

She liked me very much I observed stretching my hands out toward the
blaze

You absurd old man said Dolly Was she very charming

She was perfect

How Clever

I waved my hand impatiently

Pretty Mr Carter

Why of course the prettiest picture I everbut that goes without
saying

It would have gone better without saying remarked Dolly
Considering

To have asked Considering what would have been the acme of bad taste

I merely smiled and waved my hand again

Youre quite serious about it arent you said Dolly

I should think I was said I indignantly Not to be serious in such a
matter is to waste it utterly

Ill come to the wedding said Dolly

There wont be a wedding said I There are Reasons

Oh Youre very unlucky Mr Carter

That I observed is as it may be Lady Mickleham

Were the Reasons at the reception

They were It made no difference

Its very curious remarked Dolly with a compassionate air that you
always manage to admire people whom somebody else has married

It would be very curious I rejoined if somebody had not married the
people whom I admire Last night though I made nothing of his sudden
removal my fancy rioted in accidental deaths for him

He wont die said Dolly

I hate that sort of superstition said I irritably Hes just as
likely to die as any other man is

He certainly wont die said Dolly

Well I know he wont Do let it alone said I much exasperated It
was probably only kindness but Dolly suddenly turned her eyes away from
me and fixed them on the fire she took the fan up again and twirled it
in her hand a queer little smile bent her lips

I hope the poor man wont die said Dolly in a low voice

If he had died last night I cried longingly Then with a regretful
shrug of my shoulders I added Let him live now to the crack of doom

Somehow this restored my good humor I rose and stood with my back to
the fire stretching myself and sighing luxuriously Dolly leant back in
her chair and laughed at me

Do you expect to be forgiven she asked

No no said I I had too good an excuse

I wish Id been thereat the reception I mean

Im extremely glad you werent Lady Mickleham As it was I forgot all
my troubles

Dolly is not resentful she did not mind the implied description She
leant back smiling still I sighed again smiled at Dolly and took
my hat Then I turned to the mirror over the mantelpiece arranged my
necktie and gave my hair a touch

No one I observed can afford to neglect the niceties of the toilet
Those dainty little curls on the forehead

Youve had none there for ten years cried Lady Mickleham

I did not mean my forehead said I

Sighing once again I held out my hand to Dolly

Are you doing anything this evening she asked

That depends on what Im asked to do said I cautiously

Well Archies going to be at the House and I thought you might take
me to the Phaetons party Its quite a long drive a horrible long
drive Mr Carter

I stood for a moment considering this proposal

I dont think said I that it would be proper

Why Archie suggested it Youre making an excuse You know you are
and Lady Mickleham looked very indignant As if she added scornfully
you cared about what was proper

I dropped into a chair and said in a confidential tone I dont care
a pin It was a mere excuse I dont want to come

Youre very rude indeed Many women would never speak to you again

They would said I all do just as you will

And whats that Mr Carter

Ask me again on the first opportunity

Why wont you come said Dolly waiving this question

I bent forward holding my hat in my left hand and sawing the air with
my right forefinger

You fail to allow said I impressively for the rejuvenescence which
recent events have produced in me If I came with you this evening I
should be quite capable I paused

Of anything dreadful asked Dolly

Of paying you pronounced attentions said I gravely

That said Dolly with equal gravity would be very regrettable It
would be unjust to meand very insulting to her Mr Carter

It would be the finest testimonial to her I cried

And youll spend the evening thinking of her asked Dolly

I shall go through the evening said I in the best way I can And I
smiled contentedly

Whats her husband asked Dolly suddenly

Her husband I rejoined is nothing at all

Dolly receiving this answer looked at me with a pathetic air

Its not quite fair she observed Do you know what Im thinking
about Mr Carter

Certainly I do Lady Mickleham You are thinking that you would like to
meet me for the first time

Not at all I was thinking that it would be amusing if you met me for
the first time

I said nothing Dolly rose and walked to the window She swung the
tassel of the blind and it bumped against the window The failing sun
caught her ruddy brown hair There were curls on her forehead too

Its a grand world said I And after all one can grow old very
gradually

Youre not really old said Dolly with the fleetest glance at me A
glance should not be overlong

Gradually and disgracefully I murmured

If you met me for the first time said Dolly swinging the tassel

By Heaven it should be the last I cried and I rose to my feet

Dolly let the tassel go and made me a very pretty curtsey

I am going to another party tonight said I nodding my head
significantly

Ah said Dolly

And I shall again I pursued spend my time with the prettiest woman
in the room

Shall you asked Dolly smiling

I am a very fortunate fellow I observed And as for Mrs Hilary she
may say what she likes

Oh does Mrs Hilary know the Other Lady

I walked toward the door

There is said I laying my hand on the door no Other Lady

I shall get there about eleven said Dolly




WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

Unfortunately it was Sunday therefore the gardeners could not be
ordered to shift the long row of flower pots from the side of the
terrace next the house where Dolly had ordered them to be put to the
side remote from the house where Dolly now wished them to stand Yet
Dolly could not think of living with the pots where they were till
Monday It would kill her she said So Archie left the cool shade of
the great trees where Dolly sat doing nothing and Nellie Phaeton sat
splicing the gig whip and I lay in a deck chair with something iced
beside me Outside the sun was broiling hot and poor Archie mopped his
brow at every weary journey across the broad terrace

Its a burning shame Dolly said Miss Phaeton I wouldnt do it if
I were him

Oh yes you would dear said Dolly The pots looked atrocious on
that side

I took a long sip from my glass and observed in a meditative tone

There but for the grace of woman goes Samuel Travers Carter

Dollys lazy lids half lifted Miss Phaeton mumbled Her mouth was full
of twine

What DO you mean

Nemo omnibus horis sapit said I apologetically

I dont know what that means either

Nemoeverybody I translated sapithas been in
loveomnibusoncehorisat least

Oh and you mean she wouldnt have you asked Nellie with blunt
directness

Not quite that said I They

THEY murmured Dolly with halflifted lids

THEY I pursued regretfully recognized my impossibility Hence I am
not carrying pots across a broad terrace under a hot sun

Why did they think you impossible asked Miss Phaeton who takes much
interest in this sort of question

A variety of reasons for one I was too clever for another too
stupid for others too goodor too bad too seriousor too frivolous
too poor or

Well no one objected to your money I suppose interrupted Nellie

Pardon me I was about to say or not rich enough

But thats the same thing

The antithesis is certainly imperfect I admitted

Mr Gay said Nellie introducing the name with some timidity you
know who I meanthe poetonce said to me that man was essentially
imperfect until he was married

It is true I agreed And woman until she is dead

I dont think he meant it quite in that sense said Nellie rather
puzzled

I dont think he meant it in any sense murmured Dolly a little
unkindly

We might have gone on talking in this way for ever so long had not
Archie at this point dropped a large flower pot and smashed it to bits
He stood looking at the bits for a moment and then came towards us and
sank into a chair

Im off he announced

And half are on one side and half on the other said Dolly
regretfully

A sudden impulse seized me I got up put on my straw hat took off my
coat walked out into the sun and began to move flower pots across the
broad terrace I heard a laugh from Archie a little cry from Dolly
and from Nellie Phaeton Goodness whats he doing that for I was not
turned from my purpose The luncheon bell rang Miss Phaeton whip and
twine in hand walked into the house Archie followed her saying as he
passed that he hoped I shouldnt find it warm I went on shifting the
flower pots They were very heavy I broke two but I went on Presently
Dolly put up her parasol and came out from the shade to watch me She
stood there for a moment or two Then she said

Well do you think youd like it Mr Carter

Wait till Ive finished said I waving my hand

Another ten minutes saw the end of my task Panting and hot I sought
the shade and flung myself onto my deck chair again I also lit a
cigarette

I think they looked better on the other side after all said Dolly
meditatively

Of course you do said I urbanely You neednt tell me that

Perhaps youd like to move them back she suggested

No said I Ive done enough to create the impression

And how did you like it

It was said I in its way a pleasant enough illusion And I
shrugged my shoulders and blew a ring of smoke

To my very considerable gratification Dollys tone manifested some
annoyance as she asked

Why do you say in its way

Because in spite of the momentary pleasure I gained from feeling
myself a married man I could not banish the idea that we should not
permanently suit one another

Oh you thought that said Dolly smiling again

I must confess it said I The fault I know would be mine

Im sure of that said Dolly

But the fact is that I cant exist in too high altitudes The
rarefaction of the moral atmosphere

Please dont use all those long words

Well then to put it plainly said I with a pleasant smile I felt
all the time that Mrs Hilary would be too good for me

It is not very often that it falls to my humble lot to startle Lady
Mickleham out of her composure But at this point she sat up quite
straight in her chair her cheek flushed and her eyelids ceased to
droop in indolent insouciance

Mrs Hilary she said What has Mrs Hilary

I really thought you understood said I the object of my
experiment

Dolly glanced at me I believe that my expression was absolutely
innocentand I am of course sure that hers expressed mere surprise

I thought she said after a pause that you were thinking of Nellie
Phaeton

Oh I see cried I smiling A natural mistake to be sure

She thought so too pursued Dolly biting her lip

Did she though

And Im sure shed be quite annoyed if she thought you were thinking of
Mrs Hilary

As a matter of fact I observed she didnt understand what I was
doing at all

Dolly leant back The relics of a frown still dwelt on her brow
presently however she began to swing her hat on her forefinger and
she threw a look at me I immediately looked up toward the branches
above my head

We might as well go in to lunch said Dolly

By all means I acquiesced with alacrity

We went out into the sunshine and came where the pots were Suddenly
Dolly said

Go back and sit down again Mr Carter

I want my lunch I ventured to observe

Do as I tell you said Dolly stamping her foot whereat much
intimidated I went back and stretched myself once more on the deck
chair

Dolly approached a flower pot She stooped down exerting her strength
lifted it and carried it not without effort across the terrace

Again she did the like I sat smoking and watching She lifted a third
pot but dropped it half way Then dusting her hands against one
another she came back slowly into the shade and sat down I made no
remark

Dolly glanced at me

Well she said

Womanwomanwoman said I sadly

Must I carry some more asked Dolly in a humble yet protesting
tone

Mrs Hilary I began is an exceedingly attractive

Dolly rose with a sigh

Where are you going I asked

More pots said Dolly standing opposite me I must go on you see

Till when Lady Mickleham

Till you tell the truth said Dolly and she suddenly burst into a
little laugh

Womanwomanwoman said I again Lets go in to lunch

Im going to carry the pots said Dolly Its awfully hot Mr
Carterand look at my poor hands

She held them out to me

Lunch said I

Pots said Dolly with infinite firmness

The window of the dining room opened and Archie put his head out

Come along you two he called Everythings getting cold

Dolly turned an appealing glance on me

How obstinate you are she said You know perfectly well

I began to walk towards the house

Im going in to lunch said I

Ask them to keep some for me said Dolly and she turned up the
sleeves of her gown till her wrists were free

Its most unfair said I indignantly

I dont care if it is said Dolly stooping down to lift a pot

I watched her strain to lift it She had chosen the largest and
heaviest she sighed delicately and delicately she panted She also
looked at her hands and held them up for me to see the lines of brown
on the pink I put my hands in my pockets and said most sulkily as I
turned away towards the house

All right It wasnt Mrs Hilary then

Dolly rose up seized me by the arm and made me run to the house

Mr Carter she cried would stop for those wretched pots Hes moved
all except two but hes broken three Isnt he stupid

You are an old ass Carter said Archie

I believe youre right Archie said I




ONE WAY IN

I had a very curious dream the other night In fact I dreamt that I was
dead I passed through a green baize door and found myself in a small
square room Opposite me was another door inscribed Elysian Fields
and in front of it at a large table with a raised ledge sat
Rhadamanthus As I entered I saw a graceful figure vanish through the
door opposite

Its no use trying to deceive me I observed That was Mrs Hilary I
think if you dont mind Ill join her

Im afraid I must trouble you to take a seat for a few moments Mr
Carter said Rhadamanthus while I run over your little account

Any formalities which are usual I murmured politely as I sat down

Rhadamanthus turned over the leaves of a large book

CarterSamuel Travers isnt it he asked

Yes For goodness sake dont confuse me with Vincent Carter He only
paid five shillings in the pound

Your case presents some peculiar features Mr Carter said
Rhadamanthus I hope I am not censorious butwell that fine at
Bowstreet

I was a mere boy said I with some warmth and my solicitor grossly
mismanaged the case

Well well said he soothingly But havent you spent a great deal of
time at Monte Carlo

A man must be somewhere said I

Rhadamanthus scratched his nose

I should have wasted the money anyhow I added

I suppose you would he conceded But what of this caveat lodged by
the Dowager Lady Mickleham Thats rather serious you know isnt it
nowjoking apart

I am disappointed I remarked to find a man of your experience
paying any attention to such an illnatured old woman

We have our rules he replied and Im afraid Mr Carter that until
that caveat is removed

You dont mean that

Really Im afraid so

Then I may as well go back said I taking my hat

At this moment there was a knock at the door

Although I cant oblige you with an order of admission said
Rhadamanthus very civilly perhaps it would amuse you to listen to a
case or two Theres no hurry you know Youve got lots of time before
you

It will be an extremely interesting experience said I sitting down
again

The door opened and as I expected I dont know why but it happens
like that in dreams Dolly Mickleham came in She did not seem to see
me She bowed to Rhadamanthus smiled and took a chair immediately
opposite the table

MicklehamDorotheaCountess of she said

Formerly I think Dolly Foster asked Rhadamanthus

I dont see what thats got to do with it said Dolly

The account runs on he explained and began to consult his big
book Dolly leant back in her chair slowly peeling off her gloves
Rhadamanthus shut the book with a bang

Its not the least use he said decisively It wouldnt be kind to
pretend that it was Lady Mickleham

Dear dear said Dolly Whats the matter

Half the women in London have petitioned against you

Have they really cried Dolly to all appearance rather delighted
What do they say Mr Rhadamanthus Is it in that book Let me look
And she held out her hand

The books too heavy for you to hold said he

Ill come round said Dolly So she went round and leant over his
shoulder and read the book

Whats that scent youve got on asked Rhadamanthus

Bouquet du diable said she I had never heard of the perfume
before Isnt it sweet

I havent smelt it since I was a boy sighed Rhadamanthus

Poor old thing said Dolly Im not going to read all this you
know And with a somewhat contemptuous smile she walked back to her
chair They ought to be ashamed of themselves she added as she sat
down Its just because Im not a fright

Arent you a fright asked Rhadamanthus Where are my spectacles

He put them on and looked at Dolly

I must go in you know said Dolly smiling at Rhadamanthus My
husband has gone in

I shouldnt have thought youd consider that conclusive said he with
a touch of satire in his tone

Dont be horrid said Dolly pouting

There was a pause Rhadamanthus examined Dolly through his spectacles

This is a very painful duty said he at last I have sat here for a
great many years and I have seldom had a more painful duty

Its very absurd of you said Dolly

I cant help it though said he

Do you really mean that Im not to go in

I do indeed said Rhadamanthus

Dolly rose She leant her arms on the raised ledge which ran along the
table and she leant her chin on her hands

Really she said

Really said he looking the other way

A sudden change came over Dollys face Her dimples vanished her
eyes grew pathetic and began to shine rather than to sparkle her lip
quivered just a little

Youre very unkind she said in an extremely low tone I had no idea
you would be so unkind

Rhadamanthus seemed very uncomfortable

Dont do that he said quite sharply fidgeting with the blotting
paper

Dolly began to move slowly round the table Rhadamanthus sat still When
she was standing close by him she put her hand lightly on his arm and
said

Please do Mr Rhadamanthus

Its as much as my place is worth he grumbled

Dollys eyes shone still but the faintest little smile began to play
about her mouth

Some day she said with total inappropriateness now I come to think
of it though it did not strike me so at the time youll be glad to
remember having done a kind thing When youre oldbecause you are
not really old nowyou will say Im glad I didnt send poor Dolly
Mickleham away crying

Rhadamanthus uttered an inarticulate soundhalf impatience half I
fancy something else

We are none of us perfect I dare say If I asked your wife

I havent got a wife said Rhadamanthus

Thats why youre so hardhearted said Dolly A man whos got a wife
is never hard on other women

There was another pause Then Rhadamanthus looking straight at the
blotting paper said

Oh well dont bother me Be off with you and as he spoke the door
behind him opened

Oh you old dear she cried and stooping swiftly she kissed
Rhadamanthus Youre horribly bristly she laughed and then before
he could move she ran through the door

I rose from my seat taking my hat and stick in my hand I felt as
you may suppose that I had been there long enough When I moved
Rhadamanthus looked up and with an attempt at unconsciousness observed

We will proceed with your case now if you please Mr Carter

I looked him full in the face Rhadamanthus blushed I pursued my way
towards the door

Stop he said in a blustering tone You cant go there you know

I smiled significantly

Isnt it rather too late for that sort of thing I asked You seem to
forget that I have been here for the last quarter of an hour

I didnt know she was going to do it he protested

Oh of course said I that will be your story Mine however I
shall tell in my own way

Rhadamanthus blushed again Evidently he felt that he was in a delicate
position We were standing thus facing one another when the door began
to open again and Dolly put her head out

Oh its you is it she said I thought I heard your voice Come
along and help me to find Archie

This gentleman says Im not to come in said I

Oh what nonsense Now you really mustnt be silly Mr
Rhadamanthusor I shall have toMr Carter you werent there were
you

I wasand a more interesting piece of scandal it has seldom been

Hush I didnt do anything Now you know I didnt Mr Carter

No said I you didnt But Rhadamanthus taking you unawares

Oh be off with youboth of you cried Rhadamanthus

Thats sensible said Dolly Because you know there really isnt any
harm in poor Mr Carter

Rhadamanthus vanished Dolly and I went inside

I suppose everything will be very different here said Dolly and I
think she sighed

Whether it were or not I dont know for just then I awoke and found
myself saying aloud in answer to the dream voice and the dream face
which had not gone altogether with the dream

Not everythinga speech that I agree I ought not to have made even
though it were only in a dream
