ON THE DECAY OF THE ART OF LYING

by Mark Twain Sameul Clemens




ESSAY FOR DISCUSSION READ AT A MEETING OF THE HISTORICAL
AND ANTIQUARIAN CLUB OF HARTFORD AND OFFERED FOR THE
THIRTYDOLLAR PRIZE

 Did not take the prize



Observe I do not mean to suggest that the _custom_ of lying has
suffered any decay or interruptionno for the Lie as a Virtue A
Principle is eternal the Lie as a recreation a solace a refuge in
time of need the fourth Grace the tenth Muse mans best and surest
friend is immortal and cannot perish from the earth while this club
remains My complaint simply concerns the decay of the _art_ of lying
No highminded man no man of right feeling can contemplate the
lumbering and slovenly lying of the present day without grieving to see
a noble art so prostituted In this veteran presence I naturally enter
upon this theme with diffidence it is like an old maid trying to teach
nursery matters to the mothers in Israel It would not become to me to
criticise you gentlemenwho are nearly all my eldersand my
superiors in this thingif I should here and there _seem_ to do it I
trust it will in most cases be more in a spirit of admiration than
faultfinding indeed if this finest of the fine arts had everywhere
received the attention the encouragement and conscientious practice
and development which this club has devoted to it I should not need to
utter this lament or shed a single tear I do not say this to flatter
I say it in a spirit of just and appreciative recognition It had been
my intention at this point to mention names and to give illustrative
specimens but indications observable about me admonished me to beware
of the particulars and confine myself to generalities

No fact is more firmly established than that lying is a necessity of our
circumstancesthe deduction that it is then a Virtue goes without
saying No virtue can reach its highest usefulness without careful and
diligent cultivationtherefore it goes without saying that this one
ought to be taught in the public schoolseven in the newspapers What
chance has the ignorant uncultivated liar against the educated expert
What chance have I against Mr Peragainst a lawyer _Judicious_ lying
is what the world needs I sometimes think it were even better and safer
not to lie at all than to lie injudiciously An awkward unscientific
lie is often as ineffectual as the truth

Now let us see what the philosophers say Note that venerable proverb
Children and fools _always_ speak the truth The deduction is plain
adults and wise persons _never_ speak it Parkman the historian says
The principle of truth may itself be carried into an absurdity In
another place in the same chapters he says The saying is old that
truth should not be spoken at all times and those whom a sick
conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles
and nuisances It is strong language but true None of us could _live_
with an habitual truthteller but thank goodness none of us has to An
habitual truthteller is simply an impossible creature he does not
exist he never has existed Of course there are people who _think_ they
never lie but it is not soand this ignorance is one of the very
things that shame our socalled civilization Everybody liesevery day
every hour awake asleep in his dreams in his joy in his mourning
if he keeps his tongue still his hands his feet his eyes his
attitude will convey deceptionand purposely Even in sermonsbut
that is a platitude

In a far country where I once lived the ladies used to go around paying
calls under the humane and kindly pretence of wanting to see each
other and when they returned home they would cry out with a glad
voice saying We made sixteen calls and found fourteen of them out
not meaning that they found out anything important against the
fourteenno that was only a colloquial phrase to signify that they
were not at homeand their manner of saying it expressed their lively
satisfaction in that fact Now their pretence of wanting to see the
fourteenand the other two whom they had been less lucky withwas that
commonest and mildest form of lying which is sufficiently described as a
deflection from the truth Is it justifiable Most certainly It is
beautiful it is noble for its object is _not_ to reap profit but to
convey a pleasure to the sixteen The ironsouled truthmonger would
plainly manifest or even utter the fact that he didnt want to see
those peopleand he would be an ass and inflict totally unnecessary
pain And next those ladies in that far countrybut never mind they
had a thousand pleasant ways of lying that grew out of gentle impulses
and were a credit to their intelligence and an honor to their hearts
Let the particulars go

The men in that far country were liars every one Their mere howdydo
was a lie because _they_ didnt care how you did except they were
undertakers To the ordinary inquirer you lied in return for you made
no conscientious diagnostic of your case but answered at random and
usually missed it considerably You lied to the undertaker and said
your health was failinga wholly commendable lie since it cost you
nothing and pleased the other man If a stranger called and interrupted
you you said with your hearty tongue Im glad to see you and said
with your heartier soul I wish you were with the cannibals and it was
dinnertime When he went you said regretfully _Must_ you go and
followed it with a Call again but you did no harm for you did not
deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt whereas the truth would have made
you both unhappy

I think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art and
should be cultivated The highest perfection of politeness is only a
beautiful edifice built from the base to the dome of graceful and
gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying

What I bemoan is the growing prevalence of the brutal truth Let us do
what we can to eradicate it An injurious truth has no merit over an
injurious lie Neither should ever be uttered The man who speaks an
injurious truth lest his soul be not saved if he do otherwise should
reflect that that sort of a soul is not strictly worth saving The man
who tells a lie to help a poor devil out of trouble is one of whom the
angels doubtless say Lo here is an heroic soul who casts his own
welfare in jeopardy to succor his neighbors let us exalt this
magnanimous liar

An injurious lie is an uncommendable thing and so also and in the
same degree is an injurious trutha fact that is recognized by the law
of libel

Among other common lies we have the _silent_ liethe deception which
one conveys by simply keeping still and concealing the truth Many
obstinate truthmongers indulge in this dissipation imagining that if
they _speak_ no lie they lie not at all In that far country where I
once lived there was a lovely spirit a lady whose impulses were always
high and pure and whose character answered to them One day I was there
at dinner and remarked in a general way that we are all liars She
was amazed and said Not _all_ It was before Pinafores time so I
did not make the response which would naturally follow in our day but
frankly said Yes _all_we are all liars There are no exceptions
She looked almost offended Why do you include _me_ Certainly I
said I think you even rank as an expert She said Shsh the
children So the subject was changed in deference to the childrens
presence and we went on talking about other things But as soon as the
young people were out of the way the lady came warmly back to the
matter and said I have made a rule of my life to never tell a lie and
I have never departed from it in a single instance I said I dont
mean the least harm or disrespect but really you have been lying like
smoke ever since Ive been sitting here It has caused me a good deal of
pain because Im not used to it She required of me an instancejust
a single instance So I said

Well here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank which the Oakland
hospital people sent to you by the hand of the sicknurse when she came
here to nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness This
blank asks all manners of questions as to the conduct of that
sicknurse Did she ever sleep on her watch Did she ever forget to
give the medicine and so forth and so on You are warned to be very
careful and explicit in your answers for the welfare of the service
requires that the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise punished for
derelictions You told me you were perfectly delighted with this nurse
that she had a thousand perfections and only one fault you found you
never could depend on her wrapping Johnny up half sufficiently while he
waited in a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed You filled
up the duplicate of this paper and sent it back to the hospital by the
hand of the nurse How did you answer this questionWas the nurse at
any time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the
patients taking cold Comeeverything is decided by a bet here in
California ten dollars to ten cents you lied when you answered that
question She said I didnt _I left it blank_ Just soyou have
told a _silent_ lie you have left it to be inferred that you had no
fault to find in that matter She said Oh was that a lie And _how_
could I mention her one single fault and she is so goodIt would have
been cruel I said One ought always to lie when one can do good by
it your impulse was right but your judgment was crude this comes of
unintelligent practice Now observe the results of this inexpert
deflection of yours You know Mr Joness Willie is lying very low with
scarletfever well your recommendation was so enthusiastic that that
girl is there nursing him and the wornout family have all been
trustingly sound asleep for the last fourteen hours leaving their
darling with full confidence in those fatal hands because you like
young George Washington have a reputaHowever if you are not going to
have anything to do I will come around tomorrow and well attend the
funeral together for of course youll naturally feel a peculiar
interest in Willies caseas personal a one in fact as the
undertaker

But that was not all lost Before I was halfway through she was in a
carriage and making thirty miles an hour toward the Jones mansion to
save what was left of Willie and tell all she knew about the deadly
nurse All of which was unnecessary as Willie wasnt sick I had been
lying myself But that same day all the same she sent a line to the
hospital which filled up the neglected blank and stated the _facts_
too in the squarest possible manner

Now you see this ladys fault was _not_ in lying but in lying
injudiciously She should have told the truth _there_ and made it up
to the nurse with a fraudulent compliment further along in the paper
She could have said In one respect this sicknurse is perfectionwhen
she is on the watch she never snores Almost any little pleasant lie
would have taken the sting out of that troublesome but necessary
expression of the truth

Lying is universalwe _all_ do it Therefore the wise thing is for us
diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully judiciously to lie
with a good object and not an evil one to lie for others advantage
and not our own to lie healingly charitably humanely not cruelly
hurtfully maliciously to lie gracefully and graciously not awkwardly
and clumsily to lie firmly frankly squarely with head erect not
haltingly tortuously with pusillanimous mien as being ashamed of our
high calling Then shall we be rid of the rank and pestilent truth that
is rotting the land then shall we be great and good and beautiful and
worthy dwellers in a world where even benign Nature habitually lies
except when she promises execrable weather ThenBut I am but a new and
feeble student in this gracious art I cannot instruct _this_ club

Joking aside I think there is much need of wise examination into what
sorts of lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged seeing we _must_
all lie and we _do_ all lie and what sorts it may be best to avoidand
this is a thing which I feel I can confidently put into the hands of
this experienced Cluba ripe body who may be termed in this regard
and without undue flattery Old Masters
