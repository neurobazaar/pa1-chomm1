STALKY  CO

By Rudyard Kipling




 Let us now praise famous men
 Men of little showing
 For their work continueth
 And their work continueth
 Greater than their knowing

 Western wind and open surge
 Tore us from our mothers
 Flung us on a naked shore
 Twelve bleak houses by the shore
 Seven summers by the shore
 Mid two hundred brothers

 There we met with famous men
 Set in office oer us
 And they beat on us with rods
 Faithfully with many rods
 Daily beat us on with rods
 For the love they bore us

 Out of Egypt unto Troy
 Over Himalaya
 Far and sure our bands have gone
 HyBrasil or Babylon
 Islands of the Southern Run
 And cities of Cathaia

 And we all praise famous men
 Ancients of the College
 For they taught us common sense
 Tried to teach us common sense
 Truth and Gods Own Common Sense
 Which is more than knowledge

 Each degree of Latitude
 Strung about Creation
 Seeth one or more of us
 Of one muster all of us
 Of one master all of us
 Keen in his vocation

 This we learned from famous men
 Knowing not its uses
 When they showed in daily work
 Man must finish off his work
 Right or wrong his daily work
 And without excuses

 Servants of the staff and chain
 Mine and fuse and grapnel
 Some before the face of Kings
 Stand before the face of Kings
 Bearing gifts to divers Kings
 Gifts of Case and Shrapnel

 This we learned from famous men
 Teaching in our borders
 Who declared it was best
 Safest easiest and best
 Expeditious wise and best
 To obey your orders

 Some beneath the further stars
 Bear the greater burden
 Set to serve the lands they rule
 Save he serve no man may rule
 Serve and love the lands they rule
 Seeking praise nor guerdon

 This we learned from famous men
 Knowing not we learned it
 Only as the years went by
 Lonely as the years went by
 Far from help as years went by
 Plainer we discerned it

 Wherefore praise we famous men
 From whose bays we borrow
 They that put aside Today
 All the joys of their Today
 And with toil of their Today
 Bought for us Tomorrow

 Bless and praise we famous men
 Men of little showing
 For their work continueth
 And their work continueth
 Broad and deep continueth
 Great beyond their knowing

IN AMBUSH


In summer all rightminded boys built huts in the furzehill behind the
Collegelittle lairs whittled out of the heart of the prickly bushes
full of stumps odd rootends and spikes but since they were strictly
forbidden palaces of delight And for the fifth summer in succession
Stalky McTurk and Beetle this was before they reached the dignity of
a study had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation where
they smoked

Now there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr Prout
their housemaster at all commanding respect nor did Foxy the
subtle redhaired school Sergeant trust them His business was to wear
tennisshoes carry binoculars and swoop hawklike upon evil boys Had
he taken the field alone that hut would have been raided for Foxy
knew the manners of his quarry but Providence moved Mr Prout
whose schoolname derived from the size of his feet was Hoofer to
investigate on his own account and it was the cautious Stalky who
found the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful
afternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten Prout and his works in
a volume of Surtees and a new briarwood pipe Crusoe at sight of the
footprint did not act more swiftly than Stalky He removed the pipes
swept up all loose matchends and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk

But it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies
till he had met and conferred with little Hartopp President of the
Natural History Society an institution which Stalky held in contempt
Hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly as he knew how
begged to propose himself Beetle and McTurk as candidates confessed
to a longsmothered interest in firstflowerings early butterflies and
new arrivals and volunteered if Mr Hartopp saw fit to enter on the
new life at once Being a master Hartopp was suspicious but he was
also an enthusiast and his gentle little soul had been galled by
chanceheard remarks from the three and specially Beetle So he was
gracious to that repentant sinner and entered the three names in his
book

Then and not till then did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their
house formroom They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in
the furze which they called the wuzzy

All up said Stalky serenely I spotted Heffys fairy feet round our
hut after dinner Blessing theyre so big

Confound Did you hide our pipes said Beetle

Oh no Left em in the middle of the hut of course What a blind ass
you are Beetle Dyou think nobody thinks but yourself Well we cant
use the hut any more Hoofer will be watchin it

Bother Likewise blow said McTurk thoughtfully unpacking the
volumes with which his chest was cased The boys carried their libraries
between their belt and their collar Nice job This means were under
suspicion for the rest of the term

Why All that Heffy has found is a hut He and Foxy will watch it Its
nothing to do with us only we mustnt be seen that way for a bit

Yes and where else are we to go said Beetle You chose that place
tooanan I wanted to read this afternoon

Stalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form

Youre a despondin brute Beetle Sometimes I think I shall have to
drop you altogether Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet
_His rebus infectis_after Id seen Heffys mantracks marchin
round our hut I found little Hartopp_destricto ense_wavin a
butterflynet I conciliated Hartopp Told him that youd read papers
to the Bughunters if hed let you join Beetle Told him you liked
butterflies Turkey Anyhow I soothed the Hartoffles and were
Bughunters now

Whats the good of that said Beetle

Oh Turkey kick him

In the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members
of the Natural History Society They could wander if they kept clear
of all houses practically where they chose Mr Hartopp holding himself
responsible for their good conduct

Beetle began to see this as McTurk began the kicking

Im an ass Stalky he said guarding the afflicted part _Pax_
Turkey Im an ass

Dont stop Turkey Isnt your Uncle Stalky a great man

Great man said Beetle

All the same bughuntins a filthy business said McTurk How the
deuce does one begin

This way said Stalky turning to some fags lockers behind him Fags
are dabs at Natural History Heres young Braybrookes botanycase He
flung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide Gives one
no end of a professional air I think Heres Clay Minors geological
hammer Beetle can carry that Turkey youd better covet a
butterflynet from somewhere

Im blowed if I do said McTurk simply with immense feeling
Beetle give me the hammer

All right Im not proud Chuck us down that net on top of the lockers
Stalky

Thats all right Its a collapsible jamboree too Beastly luxurious
dogs these fags are Built like a fishinrod Pon my sainted Sam
but we look the complete Bughunters Now listen to your Uncle Stalky
Were goin along the cliffs after butterflies Very few chaps come
there Were goin to leg it too Youd better leave your book behind

Not much said Beetle firmly Im not goin to be done out of my fun
for a lot of filthy butterflies

Then youll sweat horrid Youd better carry my Jorrocks Twont make
you any hotter

They all sweated for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along
the cliffs under the furzehills crossing combe after gorzy combe They
took no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries and all that
Turkey said of geology was utterly unquotable

Are we going to Clovelly he puffed at last and they flung themselves
down on the short springy turf between the drone of the sea below and
the light summer wind among the inland trees They were looking into a
combe half full of old high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe
of brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies It was as
though onehalf the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliffs
edge The side nearest to them was open grass and fairly bristled with
noticeboards

Feerocious old cove this said Stalky reading the nearest
_Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law_ G M Dabney Col
JP an all the rest of it Dont seem to me that any chap in his
senses would trespass here does it

Youve got to prove damage fore you can prosecute for anything Cant
prosecute for trespass said McTurk whose father held many acres in
Ireland Thats all rot

Glad of that cause this looks like what we wanted Not straight
across Beetle you blind lunatic Anyone could spot us half a mile off
This way and furl up your beastly butterflynet

Beetle disconnected the ring thrust the net into a pocket shut up
the handle to a twofoot stave and slid the canering round his waist
Stalky led inland to the wood which was perhaps a quarter of a mile
from the sea and reached the fringe of the brambles

_Now_ we can get straight down through the furze and never show up
at all said the tactician Beetle go ahead and explore Snf Snf
Beastly stink of fox somewhere

On all fours save when he clung to his spectacles Beetle wormed into
the gorse and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had
found a very fair foxtrack This was well for Beetle since Stalky
pinched him _a tergo_ Down that tunnel they crawled It was evidently
a highway for the inhabitants of the combe and to their inexpressible
joy ended at the very edge of the cliff in a few square feet of dry
turf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse

By gum There isnt a single thing to do except lie down said Stalky
returning a knife to his pocket Look here

He parted the tough stems before him and it was as a window opened on
a far view of Lundy and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a
couple of hundred feet below They could hear young jackdaws squawking
on the ledges the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of
sight and with great deliberation Stalky spat on to the back of a
young rabbit sunning himself far down where only a cliffrabbit could
have found foothold Great gray and black gulls screamed against the
jackdaws the heavyscented acres of bloom round them were alive with
lownesting birds singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks
passed and returned and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits
thumped and frolicked

Whew What a place Talk of natural history this is it said Stalky
filling himself a pipe Isnt it scrumptious Good old sea He spat
again approvingly and was silent

McTurk and Beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their
stomachs chin in hand The sea snored and gurgled the birds scattered
for the moment by these new animals returned to their businesses and
the boys read on in the rich warm sleepy silence

Hullo heres a keeper said Stalky shutting Handley Cross
 cautiously and peering through the jungle A man with a gun appeared on
the skyline to the east Confound him hes going to sit down

Hed swear we were poachin too said Beetle Whats the good of
pheasants eggs Theyre always addled too

Might as well get up to the wood I think said Stalky We dont want
G M Dabney Col JP to be bothered about us so soon Up the wuzzy
and keep quiet He may have followed us you know

Beetle was already far up the tunnel They heard him gasp indescribably
there was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze

Aie yeou little red rascal I see yeou The keeper threw the gun to
his shoulder and fired both barrels in their direction The pellets
dusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between Stalkys
legs and ran over the cliffedge

They said nothing till they reached the wood torn disheveled hot but
unseen

Narrow squeak said Stalky Ill swear some of the pellets went
through my hair

Did you see him said Beetle I almost put my hand on him Wasnt
he a wopper Didnt he stink Hullo Turkey whats the matter Are you
hit

McTurks lean face had turned pearly white his mouth generally half
open was tight shut and his eyes blazed They had never seen him like
this save once in a sad time of civil war

Do you know that that was just as bad as murder he said in a grating
voice as he brushed prickles from his head

Well he didnt hit us said Stalky I think it was rather a lark
Here where are you going

Im going up to the house if there is one said McTurk pushing
through the hollies I am going to tell this Colonel Dabney

Are you crazy Hell swear it served us jolly well right Hell report
us Itll be a public lickin Oh Turkey dont be an ass Think of
us

You fool said McTurk turning savagely Dyou suppose Im thinkin
of _us_ Its the keeper

Hes cracked said Beetle miserably as they followed Indeed this
was a new Turkeya haughty angular noselifted Turkeywhom they
accompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn where a whitewhiskered
old gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming
vigorously

Are you Colonel Dabney McTurk began in this new creaking voice of
his

II am and his eyes traveled up and down the boywhowhat the
devil dyou want Yeve been disturbing my pheasants Dont attempt to
deny it Ye neednt laugh at it McTurks not too lovely features had
twisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant Youve
been birdsnesting You neednt hide your hat I can see that you
belong to the College Dont attempt to deny it Ye do Your name
and number at once sir Ye want to speak to meEh You saw my
noticeboards Must have Dont attempt to deny it Ye did Damnable oh
damnable

He choked with emotion McTurks heel tapped the lawn and he stuttered a
littletwo sure signs that he was losing his temper But why should he
the offender be angry

Lolook here sir Dodo you shoot foxes Because if you dont your
keeper does Weve seen him I dodont care what you call usbut its
an awful thing Its the ruin of good feelin among neighbors A maman
ought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin Its
worse than murder because theres no legal remedy McTurk was quoting
confusedly from his father while the old gentleman made noises in his
throat

Do you know who I am he gurgled at last Stalky and Beetle quaking

No sorr nor do I care if ye belonged to the Castle itself Answer me
now as one gentleman to another Do ye shoot foxes or do ye not

And four years before Stalky and Beetle had carefully kicked McTurk out
of his Irish dialect Assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke
and as assuredly he would be slainonce by the old gentleman and once
by the Head A public licking for the three was the least they could
expect Yetif their eyes and ears were to be trustedthe old
gentleman had collapsed It might be a lull before the storm but

I do not He was still gurgling

Then you must sack your keeper Hes not fit to live in the same county
with a Godfearin fox An a vixen tooat this time o year

Did ye come up on purpose to tell me this

Of course I did ye silly man with a stamp of the foot Would you
not have done as much for me if youd seen that thing happen on my land
now

Forgottenforgotten was the College and the decency due to elders
McTurk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy
West coast where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked
acres only son of a threehundredyearold house lord of a crazy
fishingboat and the idol of his fathers shiftless tenantry It was
the landed man speaking to his equaldeep calling to deepand the old
gentleman acknowledged the cry

I apologize said he I apologize unreservedlyto you and to the
Old Country Now will you be good enough to tell me your story

We were in your combe McTurk began and he told his tale alternately
as a schoolboy and when the iniquity of the thing overcame him as an
indignant squire concluding So you see he must be in the habit of
it Iweone never wants to accuse a neighbors man but I took the
liberty in this case

I see Quite so For a reason ye had Infamousoh infamous

The two had fallen into step beside each other on the lawn and Colonel
Dabney was talking as one man to another This comes of promoting a
fishermana fishermanfrom his lobsterpots Its enough to ruin the
reputation of an archangel Dont attempt to deny it It is Your father
has brought you up well He has Id much like the pleasure of his
acquaintance Very much indeed And these young gentlemen English
they are Dont attempt to deny it They came up with you too
Extraordinary Extraordinary now In the present state of education I
shouldnt have thought any three boys would be well enough grounded
But out of the mouths ofNono Not that by any odds Dont attempt to
deny it Yere not Sherry always catches me under the liver butbeer
now Eh What dyou say to beer and something to eat Its long since
I was a boyabominable nuisances but exceptions prove the rule And a
vixen too They were fed on the terrace by a grayhaired housekeeper
Stalky and Beetle merely ate but McTurk with bright eyes continued a
free and lofty discourse and ever the old gentleman treated him as a
brother

My dear man of course ye can come again Did I not say exceptions
prove the rule The lower combe Man dear anywhere ye please so long
as you do not disturb my pheasants The two are not incompatible Dont
attempt to deny it Theyre not Ill never allow another gun though
Come and go as ye please Ill not see you and ye neednt see me Yeve
been well brought up Another glass of beer now I tell you a fisherman
he was and a fisherman he shall be tonight again He shall Wish
I could drown him Ill convoy you to the Lodge My people are not
preciselyahbroke to boy but theyll know you again

He dismissed them with many compliments by the high Lodgegate in the
splitoak park palings and they stood still even Stalky who had played
second not to say a dumb fiddle regarding McTurk as one from another
world The two glasses of strong homebrewed had brought a melancholy
upon the boy for slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets he
croonedOh Paddy dear and did ye hear the news thats goin round

Under other circumstances Stalky and Beetle would have fallen upon him
for that song was barred utterlyanathemathe sin of witchcraft But
seeing what he had wrought they danced round him in silence waiting
till it pleased him to touch earth

The teabell rang when they were still half a mile from College McTurk
shivered and came out of dreams The glory of his holiday estate had
left him He was a Colleger of the College speaking English once more

Turkey it was immense said Stalky generously I didnt know you
had it in you Youve got us a hut for the rest of the term where
we simply _cant_ be collared Fids Fids Oh Fids I gloat Hear me
gloat

They spun wildly on their heels jodeling after the accepted manner of
a gloat which is not unremotely allied to the primitive mans song of
triumph and dropped down the hill by the path from the gasometer just
in time to meet their housemaster who had spent the afternoon watching
their abandoned hut in the wuzzy

Unluckily all Mr Prouts imagination leaned to the darker side of
life and he looked on those youngeyed cherubims most sourly Boys that
he understood attended housematches and could be accounted for at
any moment But he had heard McTurk openly deride cricketeven
housematches Beetles views on the honor of the house he knew were
incendiary and he could never tell when the soft and smiling Stalky was
laughing at him Consequentlysince human nature is what it isthose
boys had been doing wrong somewhere He hoped it was nothing very
serious but

_Tiraralaitu_ I gloat Hear me Stalky still on his heels
whirled like a dancing dervish to the dininghall

_Tiralalaitu_ I gloat Hear me Beetle spun behind him with
outstretched arms

_Tiralalaitu_ I gloat Hear me McTurks voice cracked

Now was there or was there not a distinct flavor of beer as they shot
past Mr Prout

He was unlucky in that his conscience as a housemaster impelled him to
consult his associates Had he taken his pipe and his troubles to
little Hartopps rooms he would perhaps have been saved confusion for
Hartopp believed in boys and knew something about them His fate led
him to King a fellow housemaster no friend of his but a zealous
hater of Stalky  Co

Ahhaa said King rubbing his hands when the tale was told Curious
Now _my_ house never dream of doing these things

But you see Ive no proof exactly

Proof With the egregious Beetle As if one wanted it I suppose it
is not impossible for the Sergeant to supply it Foxy is considered
at least a match for any evasive boy in my house Of course they were
smoking and drinking somewhere That type of boy always does They think
it manly

But theyve no following in the school and they are distinctlyer
brutal to their juniors said Prout who had from a distance seen
Beetle return with interest his butterflynet to a tearful fag

Ah They consider themselves superior to ordinary delights
Selfsufficient little animals Theres something in McTurks Hibernian
sneer that would make me a little annoyed And they are so careful
to avoid all overt acts too Its sheer calculated insolence I am
strongly opposed as you know to interfering with another mans house
but they need a lesson Prout They need a sharp lesson if only to
bring down their overweening selfconceit Were I you I should devote
myself for a week to their little performances Boys of that orderand
I may flatter myself but I think I know boysdont join the
Bughunters for love Tell the Sergeant to keep his eye open and of
course in my peregrinations I may casually keep mine open too

_Tiralalaitu_ I gloat Hear me far down the corridor

Disgusting said King Where do they pick up these obscene noises
One sharp lesson is what they want

The boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days
They had all Colonel Dabneys estate to play with and they explored it
with the stealth of Red Indians and the accuracy of burglars They could
enter either by the Lodgegates on the upper roadthey were careful to
ingratiate themselves with the Lodgekeeper and his wifedrop down into
the combe and return along the cliffs or they could begin at the combe
and climb up into the road

They were careful not to cross the Colonels pathhe had served his
turn and they would not outwear their welcomenor did they show up on
the skyline when they could move in cover The shelter of the gorze
by the cliffedge was their chosen retreat Beetle christened it the
Pleasant Isle of Aves for the peace and the shelter of it and here
the pipes and tobacco once cached in a convenient ledge an arms length
down the cliff their position was legally unassailable

For observe Colonel Dabney had not invited them to enter his house
Therefore they did not need to ask specific leave to go visiting and
school rules were strict on that point He had merely thrown open his
grounds to them and since they were lawful Bughunters their extended
bounds ran up to his noticeboards in the combe and his Lodgegates on
the hill

They were amazed at their own virtue

And even if it wasnt said Stalky flat on his back staring into the
blue Even suppose we were miles out of bounds no one could get at us
through this wuzzy unless he knew the tunnel Isnt this better than
lyin up just behind the Collin a blue funk every time we had a
smoke Isnt your Uncle Stalky

No said Beetlehe was stretched at the edge of the cliff spitting
thoughtfully Weve got to thank Turkey for this Turkey is the Great
Man Turkey dear youre distressing Heffles

Gloomy old ass said McTurk deep in a book

Theyve got us under suspicion said Stalky Hoophats _is_ so
suspicious somehow and Foxy always makes every stalk he does a sort
ofsort of

Scalp said Beetle Foxys a giddy Chingangook

Poor Foxy said Stalky Hes goin to catch us one of these days
Said to me in the Gym last night Ive got my eye on you Mister
Corkran Im only warning you for your good Then I said Well you
jolly well take it off again or youll get into trouble Im only
warnin you for your good Foxy was wrath

Yes but its only fair sport for Foxy said Beetle Its Hefflelinga
that has the evil mind Shouldnt wonder if he thought we got tight

I never got squiffy but oncethat was in the holidays said Stalky
reflectively an it made me horrid sick Pon my sacred Sam though
its enough to drive a man to drink havin an animal like Hoof for
housemaster

If we attended the matches an yelled Well hit sir an stood on
one leg an grinned every time Heffy said So ho my sons Is it thus
an said Yes sir an No sir an O sir an Please sir
like a lot o filthy faags Heffy ud think no end of us said McTurk
with a sneer

Too late to begin that

Its all right The Hefflelinga means well _But_ he is an ass _And_
we show him that we think hes an ass An _so_ Heffy dont love us
Told me last night after prayers that he was _in loco parentis_
 Beetle grunted

The deuce he did cried Stalky That means hes maturin something
unusual dam mean Last time he told me that he gave me three hundred
lines for dancin the cachuca in Number Ten dormitory _Loco parentis_
by gum But whats the odds as long as youre appy _Were_ all right

They were and their very rightness puzzled Prout King and the
Sergeant Boys with bad consciences show it They slink out past the
Fives Court in haste and smile nervously when questioned They return
disordered in bare time to save a callover They nod and wink and
giggle one to the other scattering at the approach of a master But
Stalky and his allies had long outlived these manifestations of youth
They strolled forth unconcernedly and returned in excellent shape after
a light refreshment of strawberries and cream at the Lodge

The Lodgekeeper had been promoted to keeper _vice_ the murderous
fisherman and his wife made much of the boys The man too gave them
a squirrel which they presented to the Natural History Society thereby
checkmating little Hartopp who wished to know what they were doing for
Science Foxy faithfully worked some deep Devon lanes behind a lonely
crossroads inn and it was curious that Prout and King members of
Commonroom seldom friendly walked together in the same directionthat
is to say northeast

Now the Pleasant Isle of Aves lay due southwest Theyre
deepdayvilish deep said Stalky Why are they drawin those
covers

Me said Beetle sweetly I asked Foxy if he had ever tasted the beer
there That was enough for Foxy and it cheered him up a little He and
Heffy were sniffin round our old hut so long I thought theyd like a
change

Well it cant last forever said Stalky Heffys bankin up like
a thundercloud an King goes rubbin his beastly hands an grinnin
like a hyena Its shockin demoralizin for King Hell burst some
day

That day came a little sooner than they expectedcame when the
Sergeant whose duty it was to collect defaulters did not attend an
afternoon callover

Tired of pubs eh Hes gone up to the top of the bill with his
binoculars to spot us said Stalky Wonder he didnt think of that
before Did you see old Heffy cock his eye at us when we answered our
names Heffys in it too _Tiralalaitu_ I gloat Hear me Come
on

Aves said Beetle

Of course but Im not smokin _aujourdhui_ _Parceque je_ jolly well
_pense_ that well be _suivi_ Well go along the cliffs slow an give
Foxy lots of time to parallel us up above

They strolled towards the swimmingbaths and presently overtook King
Oh dont let _me_ interrupt you he said Engaged in scientific
pursuits of course I trust you will enjoy yourselves my young
friends

You see said Stalky when they were out of earshot He _cant_ keep
a secret Hes followin to cut off our line of retreat Hell wait
at the baths till Heffy comes along Theyve tried every blessed place
except along the cliffs and now they think theyve bottled us No need
to hurry

They walked leisurely over the combes till they reached the line of
noticeboards

Listen a shake Foxys up wind comin down hill like beans When you
hear him move in the bushes go straight across to Aves They want to
catch us _flagrante delicto_

They dived into the gorse at right angles to the tunnel openly crossing
the grass and lay still in Aves

What did I tell you Stalky carefully put away the pipes and tobacco
The Sergeant out of breath was leaning against the fence raking
the furze with his binoculars but he might as well have tried to see
through a sandbag Anon Prout and King appeared behind him They
conferred

Aha Foxy dont like the noticeboards and he dont like the prickles
either Now well cut up the tunnel and go to the Lodge Hullo Theyve
sent Foxy into cover

The Sergeant was waistdeep in crackling swaying furze his ears filled
with the noise of his own progress The boys reached the shelter of the
wood and looked down through a belt of hollies

Hellish noise said Stalky critically Dont think Colonel Dabney
will like it I move we go into the Lodge and get something to eat We
might as well see the fun out

Suddenly the keeper passed them at a trot Whom they to combebottom
for Lards sake Masterll be crazy he said

Poachers simly Stalky replied in the broad Devon that was the boys
_langue de guerre_

Ill poach em to raights He dropped into the funnellike combe
which presently began to fill with noises notably Kings voice crying
Go on Sergeant Leave him alone you sir He is executing my orders

Whom yeou to give arders here gingy whiskers Yeou come up to the
master Come out o that wuzzy This is to the Sergeant Yiss I
reckon us knows the boys yeoum after Theyve tu long ears an vuzzy
bellies an you nippies they in yeour pockets when theym dead Come on
up to master Hell boy yeou all youre a mind to Yeou other folk bide
your side fence

Explain to the proprietor You can explain Sergeant shouted King
Evidently the Sergeant had surrendered to the major force

Beetle lay at full length on the turf behind the Lodge literally biting
the earth in spasms of joy Stalky kicked him upright There was nothing
of levity about Stalky or McTurk save a stray muscle twitching on the
cheek

They tapped at the Lodge door where they were always welcome Come
yeou right in an set down my little dearrs said the woman Theyll
niver touch my man Hell poach em to rights Iss fai Fresh berries
an cream Us Dartymoor folk niver forgit their friends But them
Bidevor poachers theyve no hem to their garments Sugar My man heve
digged a badger for yeou my dearrs Tis in the linhay in a box

Usll take un with us when were finished here I reckon yeoum busy
Well bide here antis washin day with yeou simly said Stalky
Wem no company to make all vitty for Never yeou mind us Yiss
Theres plenty cream

The woman withdrew wiping her pink hands on her apron and left them
in the parlor There was a scuffle of feet on the gravel outside the
heavilyleaded diamond panes and then the voice of Colonel Dabney
something clearer than a bugle

Ye can read Youve eyes in your head Dont attempt to deny it Ye
have

Beetle snatched a crochetwork antimacassar from the shiny horsehair
sofa stuffed it into his mouth and rolled out of sight

You saw my noticeboards Your duty Curse your impudence sir Your
duty was to keep off my grounds Talk of duty to _me_ Whywhywhy ye
misbegotten poacher yell be teaching me my A B C next Roarin like a
bull in the bushes down there Boys Boys Boys Keep your boys at home
then Im not responsible for your boys But I dont believe itI
dont believe a word of it Yeve a furtive look in your eyea furtive
sneakin poachin look in your eye that ud ruin the reputation of an
archangel Dont attempt to deny it Ye have A sergeant More shame to

run about the country poachinon your pension Damnable Oh damnable
But Ill be considerate Ill be merciful By gad Ill be the very
essence o humanity Did ye or did ye not see my noticeboards Dont

Twentyone years in the army had left their mark on Foxy He obeyed

Now March The high Lodge gate shut with a clang My duty A
sergeant to tell me my duty puffed Colonel Dabney Good Lard more
sergeants

Its King Its King gulped Stalky his head on the horsehair pillow
McTurk was eating the ragcarpet before the speckless hearth and the
sofa heaved to the emotions of Beetle Through the thick glass the
figures without showed blue distorted and menacing

II protest against this outrage King had evidently been running
up hill The man was entirely within his duty Letlet me give you my
card

Hes in flannels Stalky buried his head again

Unfortunatelymost unfortunatelyI have not one with me but my
name is King sir a housemaster of the College and you will find me
preparedfully preparedto answer for this mans action Weve seen
three

Did ye see my noticeboards

I admit we did but under the circumstances

I stand _in loco parentis_ Prouts deep voice was added to the
discussion They could hear him pant

Fwhat Colonel Dabney was growing more and more Irish

Im responsible for the boys under my charge

Ye are are ye Then all I can say is that ye set them a very bad
examplea dam bad example if I may say so I do not own your boys
Ive not seen your boys an I tell you that if there was a boy grinnin
in every bush on the place _still_ yeve no shadow of a right here
comin up from the combe that way an frightenin everything in it
Dont attempt to deny it Ye did Ye should have come to the Lodge an
seen me like Christians instead of chasin your dam boys through the
length and breadth of my covers _In loco parentis_ ye are Well
Ive not forgotten my Latin either an Ill say to you
_Quis custodiet ipsos custodes_ If the masters trespass how can we
blame the boys

But if I could speak to you privately said Prout

Ill have nothing private with you Ye can be as private as ye please
on the other side o that gate anI wish ye a very good afternoon

A second time the gate clanged They waited till Colonel Dabney had
returned to the house and fell into one anothers arms crowing for
breath

Oh my Soul Oh my King Oh my Heffy Oh my Foxy Zeal all zeal
Mr Simple Stalky wiped his eyes Oh Oh I OhI _did_ boil the
exciseman We must get out of this or well be late for tea

GeGeget the badger and make little Hartopp happy Mamamake
em all happy sobbed McTurk groping for the door and kicking the
prostrate Beetle before him

They found the beast in an evilsmelling box left two halfcrowns for
payment and staggered home Only the badger grunted most marvelous like
Colonel Dabney and they dropped him twice or thrice with shrieks of
helpless laughter They were but imperfectly recovered when Foxy met
them by the Fives Court with word that they were to go up to their
dormitory and wait till sent for

Well take this box to Mr Hartopps rooms then Weve done something
for the Natural History Society at any rate said Beetle

Fraid that wont save you young genelmen Foxy answered in an
awful voice He was sorely ruffled in his mind

All sereno Foxibus Stalky had reached the extreme stage of hiccups
Wewell never desert you Foxy Hounds choppin foxes in cover is
more a proof of vice aint it No youre right ImIm not quite
well

Theyve gone a bit too far this time Foxy thought to himself Very
far gone _Id_ say excep there was no smell of liquor An yet it
isnt like emsomehow King and Prout they ad their dressindown
same as me Thats one comfort

Now we must pull up said Stalky rising from the bed on which he had
thrown himself Were injured innocenceas usual We dont know what
weve been sent up here for do we

No explanation Deprived of tea Public disgrace before the house
 said McTurk whose eyes were running over Its dam serious

Well hold on till King loses his temper said Beetle Hes a
libelous old rip an hell be in a ravin paddywack Prouts too
beastly cautious Keep your eye on King and if he gives us a chance
appeal to the Head That always makes em sick

They were summoned to their housemasters study King and Foxy
supporting Prout and Foxy had three canes under his arm King leered
triumphantly for there were tears undried tears of mirth on the boys
cheeks Then the examination began

Yes they had walked along the cliffs Yes they had entered Colonel
Dabneys grounds Yes they had seen the noticeboards at this point
Beetle sputtered hysterically For what purpose had they entered
Colonel Dabneys grounds Well sir there was a badger

Here King who loathed the Natural History Society because he did not
like Hartopp could no longer be restrained He begged them not to add
mendacity to open insolence But the badger was in Mr Hartopps rooms
sir The Sergeant had kindly taken it up for them That disposed of the
badger and the temporary check brought Kings temper to boilingpoint
They could hear his foot on the floor while Prout prepared his lumbering
inquiries They had settled into their stride now Their eyes ceased to
sparkle their faces were blank their hands hung beside them without a
twitch They were learning at the expense of a fellowcountryman the
lesson of their race which is to put away all emotion and entrap the
alien at the proper time

So far good King was importing himself more freely into the trial
being vengeful where Prout was grieved They knew the penalties of
trespassing With a fine show of irresolution Stalky admitted that
he had gathered some information vaguely bearing on this head but he
thoughtThe sentence was dragged out to the uttermost Stalky did not
wish to play his trump with such an opponent Mr King desired no buts
nor was he interested in Stalkys evasions They on the other hand
might be interested in his poor views Boys who creptwho sneakedwho
lurkedout of bounds even the generous bounds of the Natural
History Society which they had falsely joined as a cloak for their
misdeedstheir vicestheir villainiestheir immoralities

Hell break cover in a minute said Stalky to himself Then well run
into him before he gets away

Such boys scabrous boys moral lepersthe current of his words was
carrying King off his feetevilspeakers liars slowbelliesyea
incipient drunkards

He was merely working up to a peroration and the boys knew it but
McTurk cut through the frothing sentence the others echoing

I appeal to the Head sir

I appeal to the head sir

I appeal to the Head sir

It was their unquestioned right Drunkenness meant expulsion after a
public flogging They had been accused of it The case was the Heads
and the Heads alone

Thou hast appealed unto Caesar unto Caesar shalt thou go They had
heard that sentence once or twice before in their careers None the
less said King uneasily you would be better advised to abide by our
decision my young friends

Are we allowed to associate with the rest of the school till we see the
Head sir said McTurk to his housemaster disregarding King This at
once lifted the situation to its loftiest plane Moreover it meant no
work for moral leprosy was strictly quarantined and the Head never
executed judgment till twentyfour cold hours later

Wellerif you persist in your defiant attitude said King with a
loving look at the canes under Foxys arm There is no alternative

Ten minutes later the news was over the whole school Stalky and Co
had fallen at lastfallen by drink They had been drinking They had
returned blinddrunk from a hut They were even now lying hopelessly
intoxicated on the dormitory floor A few bold spirits crept up to look
and received boots about the head from the criminals

Weve got himgot him on the Caudine Toastingfork said Stalky
after those hints were taken Kingll have to prove his charges up to
the giddy hilt

Too much ticklee him bust Beetle quoted from a book of his reading
Didnt I say hed go pop if we lat un bide

No prep either O ye incipient drunkards said McTurk and its
trig night too Hullo Heres our dear friend Foxy More tortures
Foxibus

Ive brought you something to eat young gentlemen said the Sergeant
from behind a crowded tray Their wars had ever been waged without
malice and a suspicion floated in Foxys mind that boys who allowed
themselves to be tracked so easily might perhaps hold something in
reserve Foxy had served through the Mutiny when early and accurate
information was worth much

II noticed you adnt ad anything to eat an I spoke to Gumbly an
he said you wasnt exactly cut off from supplies So I brought up this
Its your potted am tin aint it Mr Corkran

Why Foxibus youre a brick said Stalky I didnt think you had
this muchwhats the word Beetle

Bowels Beetle replied promptly Thank you Sergeant Thats young
Carters potted ham though

There was a C on it I thought it was Mr Corkrans This is a very
serious business young gentlemen Thats what it is I didnt know
perhaps but there might be something on your side which you hadnt said
to Mr King or Mr Prout maybe

There is Heaps Foxibus This from Stalky through a full mouth

Then you see if that was the case it seemed to me I might represent
it quiet so to say to the Ead when he asks me about it Ive got to
take im the charges tonight anit looks bad on the face of it

Trocious bad Foxy Twentyseven cuts in the Gym before all the
school and public expulsion Wine is a mocker strong drink is
ragin quoth Beetle

Its nothin to make fun of young gentlemen I ave to go to the Ead
with the charges Anan you maynt be aware peraps that I was
followin you this afternoon havin my suspicions

Did ye see the noticeboards croaked McTurk in the very brogue of
Colonel Dabney

Yeve eyes in your head Dont attempt to deny it Ye did said
Beetle

A sergeant To run about poachin on your pension Damnable O
damnable said Stalky without pity

Good Lord said the Sergeant sitting heavily upon a bed
Wherewhere the devil _was_ you I might ha known it was a
dosomewhere

Oh you clever maniac Stalky resumed We maynt be aware you were
followin us this afternoon maynt we Thought you were stalkin us
eh Why we led you bung into it of course Colonel Dabneydont
you think hes a nice man FoxyColonel Dabneys our pet particular
friend Weve been goin there for weeks and weeks he invited us
You and your duty Curse your duty sir Your duty was to keep off his
covers

Youll never be able to hold up your head again Foxy The fags ll
hoot at you said Beetle

Think of your giddy prestige The Sergeant was thinkinghard

Look ere young gentlemen he said earnestly You arent surely
ever goin to tell are you Wasnt Mr Prout and Mr King inin it
too

Foxibusculus they _was_ They wassingular horrid Caught it worse
than you We heard every word of it You got off easy considerin If
Id been Dabney I swear Id ha quodded you I think Ill suggest it to
him tomorrow

An its all goin up to the Ead Oh Good Lord

Every giddy word of it my Chingangook said Beetle dancing Why
shouldnt it _Weve_ done nothing wrong _We_ aint poachers _We_
didnt cut about blastin the characters of poor innocent boyssaying
they were drunk

That I didnt said Foxy II only said that you beaved uncommon
odd when you come back with that badger Mr King may have taken the
wrong hint from that

Course he did an hell jolly well shove all the blame on you when
he finds out hes wrong We know King if you dont Im ashamed of you
You aint fit to be a sergeant said McTurk

Not with three thoroughgoin young devils like you I aint Ive
been had Ive been ambuscaded Horse foot an guns Ive been had
anan therell be no holdin the junior forms after this Mrover
the Ead will send me with a note to Colonel Dabney to ask if what you
say about bein invited was true

Then youd better go in by the Lodgegates this time instead of
chasin your dam boysoh that was the Epistle to Kingso it was
Weel Foxy Stalky put his chin on his hands and regarded the victim
with deep delight

_Tiralalaitu_ I gloat Hear me said McTurk Foxy brought us
tea when we were moral lepers Foxy has a heart Foxy has been in the
Army too

I wish Id ha had you in my company young gentlemen said the
Sergeant from the depths of his heart Id ha given you something

Silence at drumhead courtmartial McTurk went on Im advocate for
the prisoner and besides this is much too good to tell all the other
brutes in the Coll Theyd _never_ understand They play cricket and
say Yes sir and O sir and No sir

Never mind that Go ahead said Stalky

Well Foxys a good little chap when he does not esteem himself so as
to be clever

Take not out your ounds on a werry windy day Stalky struck in
_I_ dont care if you let him off

Nor me said Beetle Heffy is my only joyHeffy and King

I ad to do it said the Sergeant plaintively

Right O Led away by bad companions in the execution of his duty
oror words to that effect Youre dismissed with a reprimand Foxy
_We_ wont tell about _you_ I swear we wont McTurk concluded Bad
for the discipline of the school Horrid bad

Well said the Sergeant gathering up the teathings knowin what I
know o the young devgentlemen of the College Im very glad to ear
it But what am I to tell the Ead

Anything you jolly well please Foxy We arent the criminals

To say that the Head was annoyed when the Sergeant appeared after dinner
with the days crimesheet would be putting it mildly

Corkran McTurk and Co I see Bounds as usual Hullo What the deuce
is this Suspicion of drinking Whose charge

Mr Kings sir I caught em out of bounds sir at least that was ow
it looked But theres a lot beind sir The Sergeant was evidently
troubled

Go on said the Head Let us have your version He and the Sergeant
had dealt with one another for some seven years and the Head knew that
Mr Kings statements depended very largely on Mr Kings temper

I thought they were out of bounds along the cliffs But it come out
they wasnt sir I saw them go into Colonel Dabneys woods andMr
King and Mr Prout come alongand the fact was sir we was mistook
for poachers by Colonel Dabneys peopleMr King and Mr Prout and me
There were some words sir on both sides The young gentlemen slipped
ome somehow and they seemed ighly humorous sir Mr King was mistook
by Colonel Dabney himselfColonel Dabney bein strict Then they
preferred to come straight to you sir on account of whatwhat Mr
King may ave said about their abits afterwards in Mr Prouts study
I only said they was ighly humorous laughin an gigglin an a bit
above emselves Theyve since told me sir in a humorous way that
they was invited by Colonel Dabney to go into is woods

I see They didnt tell their housemaster that of course

They took up Mr King on appeal just as soon as he spoke about
theirabits Put in the appeal at once sir an asked to be sent
to the dormitory waitin for you Ive since gathered sir in their
humorous way sir that someow or other theyve eard about every word
Colonel Dabney said to Mr King and Mr Prout when he mistook em for
poachers II might ha known when they led me on so that they eld the
inner line of communications Itsits a plain do sir if you ask me
an theyre gloatin over it in the dormitory

The Head sawsaw even to the uttermost farthingand his mouth twitched
a little under his mustache

Send them to me at once Sergeant This case neednt wait over

Good evening said he when the three appeared under escort I want
your undivided attention for a few minutes Youve known me for five
years and Ive known you fortwentyfive I think we understand one
another perfectly I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment
the brown one please Sergeant Thanks You neednt wait Im going
to execute you without rhyme Beetle or reason I know you went to
Colonel Dabneys covers because you were invited Im not even going to
send the Sergeant with a note to ask if your statement is true because
I am convinced that on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the
truth I know too that you were not drinking You can take off
that virtuous expression McTurk or I shall begin to fear you dont
understand me There is not a flaw in any of your characters And that
is why I am going to perpetrate a howling injustice Your reputations
have been injured havent they You have been disgraced before the
house havent you You have a peculiarly keen regard for the honor of
your house havent you Well now I am going to lick you

Six apiece was their portion upon that word

And this I thinkthe Head replaced the cane and flung the written
charge into the wastepaper basketcovers the situation When you
find a variation from the normalthis will be useful to you in later
lifealways meet him in an abnormal way And that reminds me There are
a pile of paperbacks on that shelf You can borrow them if you put them
back I dont think theyll take any harm from being read in the open
They smell of tobacco rather You will go to prep this evening as
usual Goodnight said that amazing man

Goodnight and thank you sir

I swear Ill pray for the Head tonight said Beetle Those last two
cuts were just flicks on my collar Theres a Monte Cristo in that
lower shelf I saw it Bags I next time we go to Aves

Dearr man said McTurk No gating No impots No beastly questions
All settled Hullo whats King goin in to him forKing and Prout

Whatever the nature of that interview it did not improve either Kings
or Prouts ruffled plumes for when they came out of the Heads house
eyes noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose
and that the other was sweating profusely That sight compensated them
amply for the Imperial Jaw with which they were favored by the two It
seemsand who so astonished as theythat they had held back material
facts were guilty both of _suppressio veri_ and _suggestio falsi_
wellknown gods against whom they often offended further that they
were malignant in their dispositions untrustworthy in their characters
pernicious and revolutionary in their influences abandoned to the
devils of wilfulness pride and a most intolerable conceit Ninthly
and lastly they were to have a care and to be very careful

They were careful as only boys can be when there is a hurt to be
inflicted They waited through one suffocating week till Prout and
King were their royal selves again waited till there was a
housematchtheir own house tooin which Prout was taking part
waited further till he had his pads in the pavilion and stood ready to
go forth King was scoring at the window and the three sat on a bench
without

Said Stalky to Beetle I say Beetle _quis custodet ipsos custodes_

Dont ask me said Beetle Ill have nothin private with you Ye can
be as private as ye please the other end of the bench and I wish ye a
very good afternoon

McTurk yawned

Well ye should ha come up to the lodge like Christians instead o
chasin yourahemboys through the length an breadth of my covers
_I_ think these housematches are all rot Lets go over to Colonel
Dabneys an see if hes collared any more poachers

That afternoon there was joy in Aves




SLAVES OF THE LAMP


The musicroom on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the
Aladdin company at rehearsal Dickson Quartus commonly known as Dick
Four was Aladdin stagemanager balletmaster half the orchestra and
largely librettist for the book had been rewritten and filled
with local allusions The pantomime was to be given next week in the
downstairs study occupied by Aladdin Abanazar and the Emperor of
China The Slave of the Lamp with the Princess Badroulbadour and the
Widow Twankay owned Number Five study across the same landing so
that the company could be easily assembled The floor shook to the
stampandgo of the ballet while Aladdin in pink cotton tights a blue
and tinsel jacket and a plumed hat banged alternately on the piano and
his banjo He was the moving spirit of the game as befitted a senior
who had passed his Army Preliminary and hoped to enter Sandhurst next
spring

Aladdin came to his own at last Abanazar lay poisoned on the floor the
Widow Twankay danced her dance and the company decided it would come
all right on the night

What about the last song though said the Emperor a tallish
fairheaded boy with a ghost of a mustache at which he pulled manfully
We need a rousing old tune

John Peel Drink Puppy Drink suggested Abanazar smoothing his
baggy lilac pajamas Pussy Abanazar never looked more than onehalf
awake but he owned a soft slow smile which well suited the part of the
Wicked Uncle

Stale said Aladdin Might as well have Grandfathers Clock Whats
that thing you were humming at prep last night Stalky

Stalky The Slave of the Lamp in black tights and doublet a black silk
halfmask on his forehead whistled lazily where he lay on the top of
the piano It was a catchy musichall tune

Dick Four cocked his head critically and squinted down a large red
nose

Once more and I can pick it up he said strumming Sing the words

Arrah Patsy mind the baby Arrah Patsy mind the child Wrap him in
an overcoat hes surely going wild Arrah Patsy mind the baby just
you mind the child awhile Hell kick and bite and cry all night Arrah
Patsy mind the child

Rippin Oh rippin said Dick Four Only we shant have any piano
on the night We must work it with the banjoesplay an dance at the
same time You try Tertius

The Emperor pushed aside his peagreen sleeves of state and followed
Dick Four on a heavy nickel plated banjo

Yes but Im dead all this time Bung in the middle of the stage too
 said Abanazar

Oh thats Beetles biznai said Dick Four Vamp it up Beetle Dont
keep us waiting all night Youve got to get Pussy out of the light
somehow and bring us all in dancin at the end

All right You two play it again said Beetle who in a gray skirt
and a wig of chestnut sausagecurls set slantwise above a pair of
spectacles mended with an old bootlace represented the Widow Twankay
He waved one leg in time to the hammered refrain and the banjoes grew
louder

Um Ah ErAladdin now has won his wife he sang and Dick Four
repeated it

Your Emperor is appeased Tertius flung out his chest as he
delivered his line

Now jump up Pussy Say I think Id better come to life Then we
all take hands and come forward We hope youve all been pleased
_Twiggezvous_

_Nous twiggons_ Good enough Whats the chorus for the final ballet
Its four kicks and a turn said Dick Four

Oh Er

 John Short will ring the curtain down
 And ring the prompters bell
 We hope you know before you go
 That we all wish you well

Rippin Rippin Now for the Widows scene with the Princess Hurry
up Turkey

McTurk in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban slouched
forward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself The Slave of the Lamp
climbed down from the piano and dispassionately kicked him Play up
Turkey he said this is serious But there fell on the door the
knock of authority It happened to be King in gown and mortarboard
enjoying a Saturday evening prowl before dinner

Locked doors Locked doors he snapped with a scowl Whats the
meaning of this and what may I ask is the intention of thisthis
epicene attire

Pantomime sir The Head gave us leave said Abanazar as the only
member of the Sixth concerned Dick Four stood firm in the confidence
born of wellfitting tights but Beetle strove to efface himself behind
the piano A gray princessskirt borrowed from a dayboys mother and a
spotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with impositionpaper make
one ridiculous And in other regards Beetle had a bad conscience

As usual sneered King Futile foolery just when your careers such
as they may be are hanging in the balance I see Ah I see The old
gang of criminalsallied forces of disorderCorkranthe Slave of the
Lamp smiled politelyMcTurkthe Irishman scowledand of course
the unspeakable Beetle our friend Gigadibs Abanazar the Emperor and
Aladdin had more or less of characters and King passed them over Come
forth my inky buffoon from behind yonder instrument of music You
supply I presume the doggerel for this entertainment Esteem yourself
to be as it were a poet

Hes found one of em thought Beetle noting the flush on Kings
cheekbone

I have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to my
address I believean effusion intended to rhyme Soso you despise
me Master Gigadibs do you I am quite awareyou need not
explainthat it was ostensibly not intended for my edification I read
it with laughteryes with laughter These paper pellets of inky
boysstill a boy we are Master Gigadibsdo not disturb my equanimity

Wonder which it was thought Beetle He had launched many lampoons on
an appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was possible to
convey reproof in rhyme

In sign of his unruffled calm King proceeded to tear Beetle whom he
called Gigadibs slowly asunder From his untied shoestrings to his
mended spectacles the life of a poet at a big school is hard he held
him up to the derision of his associateswith the usual result His
wild flowers of speechKing had an unpleasant tonguerestored him to
good humor at the last He drew a lurid picture of Beetles latter
end as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic scattered a few
compliments over McTurk and Corkran and reminding Beetle that he must
come up for judgment when called upon went to Commonroom where he
triumphed anew over his victims

And the worst of it he explained in a loud voice over his soup is
that I waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads Its miles above
them Im certain

Weell said the school chaplain slowly I dont know what Corkrans
appreciation of your style may be but young McTurk reads Ruskin for his
amusement

Nonsense He does it to show off I mistrust the dark Celt

He does nothing of the kind I went into their study the other night
unofficially and McTurk was gluing up the back of four odd numbers of
Fors Clavigera

I dont know anything about their private lives said a mathematical
master hotly but Ive learned by bitter experience that Number Five
study are best left alone They are utterly soulless young devils

He blushed as the others laughed

But in the musicroom there were wrath and bad language Only Stalky
Slave of the Lamp lay on the piano unmoved

That little swine Manders miner must have shown him your stuff Hes
always suckin up to King Go and kill him he drawled Which one was
it Beetle

Dunno said Beetle struggling out of the skirt There was one about
his hunting for popularity with the small boys and the other one was
one about him in hell tellin the Devil he was a Balliol man I swear
both of em rhymed all right By gum Praps Manders minor showed him
both _Ill_ correct his caesuras for him

He disappeared down two flights of stairs flushed a small pink and
white boy in a formroom next door to Kings study which again
was immediately below his own and chased him up the corridor into a
formroom sacred to the revels of the Lower Third Thence he came
back greatly disordered to find McTurk Stalky and the others of the
company in his study enjoying an unlimited brewcoffee cocoa buns
new bread hot and steaming sardine sausage hamandtongue paste
pilchards three jams and at least as many pounds of Devonshire cream

My hat said he throwing himself upon the banquet Who stumped
up for this Stalky It was within a month of term end and blank
starvation had reigned in the studies for weeks

You said Stalky serenely

Confound you You havent been popping my Sunday bags then

Keep your hair on Its only your watch

Watch I lost itweeks ago Out on the Burrows when we tried to shoot
the old ramthe day our pistol burst

It dropped out of your pocket youre so beastly careless Beetle and
McTurk and I kept it for you Ive been wearing it for a week and you
never noticed Took it into Bideford after dinner today Got thirteen
and sevenpence Heres the ticket

Well thats pretty average cool said Abanazar behind a slab of cream
and jam as Beetle reassured upon the safety of his Sunday trousers
showed not even surprise much less resentment Indeed it was McTurk
who grew angry saying

You gave him the ticket Stalky You pawned it You unmitigated beast
Why last month you and Beetle sold mine Never got a sniff of any
ticket

Ah that was because you locked your trunk and we wasted half the
afternoon hammering it open We might have pawned it if youd behaved
like a Christian Turkey

My Aunt said Abanazar you chaps are communists Vote of thanks to
Beetle though

Thats beastly unfair said Stalky when I took all the trouble to
pawn it Beetle never knew he had a watch Oh I say RabbitsEggs gave
me a lift into Bideford this afternoon

RabbitsEggs was the local carrieran outcrop of the early Devonian
formation It was Stalky who had invented his unlovely name He was
pretty average drunk or he wouldnt have done it RabbitsEggs is a
little shy of me somehow But I swore it was _pax_ between us and gave
him a bob He stopped at two pubs on the way in so hell be howling
drunk tonight Oh dont begin reading Beetle theres a council of
war on What the deuce is the matter with your collar

Chivied Manders minor into the Lower Third boxroom Had all his
beastly little friends on top of me said Beetle from behind a jar of
pilchards and a book

You ass Any fool could have told you where Manders would bunk to
 said McTurk

I didnt think said Beetle meekly scooping out pilchards with a
spoon

Course you didnt You never do McTurk adjusted Beetles collar with
a savage tug Dont drop oil all over my Fors or Ill scrag you

Shut up youyou Irish Biddy Tisnt your beastly Fors Its one of
mine

The book was a fat brownbacked volume of the later Sixties which King
had once thrown at Beetles head that Beetle might see whence the
name Gigadibs came Beetle had quietly annexed the book and had
seenseveral things The quartercomprehended verses lived and ate with
him as the bedropped pages showed He removed himself from all that
world drifting at large with wondrous Men and Women till McTurk
hammered the pilchard spoon on his head and he snarled

Beetle Youre oppressed and insulted and bullied by King Dont you
feel it

Let me alone I can write some more poetry about him if I am I
suppose

Mad Quite mad said Stalky to the visitors as one exhibiting strange
beasts Beetle reads an ass called Brownin and McTurk reads an ass
called Ruskin and

Ruskin isnt an ass said McTurk Hes almost as good as the Opium
Eater He says were children of noble races trained by surrounding
art That means _me_ and the way I decorated the study when you two
badgers would have stuck up brackets and Christmas cards Child of a
noble race trained by surrounding art stop reading or Ill shove a
pilchard down your neck

Its two to one said Stalky warningly and Beetle closed the book
in obedience to the law under which he and his companions had lived for
six checkered years

The visitors looked on delighted Number Five study had a reputation for
more variegated insanity than the rest of the school put together and
so far as its code allowed friendship with outsiders it was polite and
openhearted to its neighbors on the same landing

What rot do you want now said Beetle

King War said McTurk jerking his head toward the wall where hung a
small wooden WestAfrican wardrum a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle

Then we shall be turned out of the study again said Beetle who loved
his fleshpots Mason turned us out forjust warbling on it Mason
was the mathematical master who had testified in Commonroom

WarblingO Lord said Abanazar We couldnt hear ourselves speak in
our study when you played the infernal thing Whats the good of getting
turned out of your study anyhow

We lived in the formrooms for a week too said Beetle tragically
And it was beastly cold

Yees but Masons rooms were filled with rats every day we were out
It took him a week to draw the inference said McTurk He loathes
rats Minute he let us go back the rats stopped Masons a little shy
of us now but there was no evidence

Jolly well there wasnt said Stalky when I got out on the roof and
dropped the beastly things down his chimney But look herequestion
is are our characters good enough just now to stand a study row

Never mind mine said Beetle King swears I havent any

Im not thinking of you Stalky returned scornfully You arent
going up for the Army you old bat I dont want to be expelledand the
Heads getting rather shy of us too

Rot said McTurk The Head never expels except for beastliness or
stealing But I forgot you and Stalky _are_ thievesregular burglars

The visitors gasped but Stalky interpreted the parable with large
grins

Well you know that little beast Manders minor saw Beetle and me
hammerin McTurks trunk open in the dormitory when we took his watch
last month Of course Manders sneaked to Mason and Mason solemnly took
it up as a case of theft to get even with us about the rats

That just put Mason into our giddy hands said McTurk blandly We
were nice to him because he was a new master and wanted to win the
confidence of the boys Pity he draws inferences though Stalky went
to his study and pretended to blub and told Mason hed lead a new life
if Mason would let him off this time but Mason wouldnt Said it was
his duty to report him to the Head

Vindictive swine said Beetle It was all those rats Then _I_
blubbed too and Stalky confessed that hed been a thief in regular
practice for six years ever since he came to the school and that Id
taught him_a la_ Fagin Mason turned white with joy He thought he had
us on toast

Gorgeous Gorgeous said Dick Four We never heard of this

Course not Mason kept it jolly quiet He wrote down all our
statements on impotpaper There wasnt anything he wouldnt believe
 said Stalky

And handed it all up to the Head _with_ an extempore prayer It took
about forty pages said Beetle I helped him a lot

And then you crazy idiots said Abanazar

Oh we were sent for and Stalky asked to have the depositions read
out and the Head knocked him spinning into a wastepaper basket Then
he gave us eight cuts apieceweltersforfortakin unheardof
liberties with a new master I saw his shoulders shaking when we went
out Do you know said Beetle pensively that Mason cant look at us
now in second lesson without blushing We three stare at him sometimes
till he regularly trickles Hes an awfully sensitive beast

He read Eric or Little by Little said McTurk so we gave him St
Winifreds or the World of School They spent all their spare time
stealing at St Winifreds when they werent praying or getting drunk
at pubs Well that was only a week ago and the Heads a little bit shy
of us He called it constructive deviltry Stalky invented it all

Not the least good having a row with a master unless you can make an
ass of him said Stalky extended at ease on the hearthrug If Mason
didnt know Number Fivewell hes learnt thats all Now my dearly
beloved earersStalky curled his legs under him and addressed the
companyweve got that strong perseverin man King on our hands He
went miles out of his way to provoke a conflict Here Stalky snapped
down the black silk domino and assumed the air of a judge He has
oppressed Beetle McTurk and me _privatim et seriatim_ one by one
as he could catch us But now he has insulted Number Five up in
the musicroom and in the presence of thesethese ossifers of the
Ninetythird wot look like hairdressers Binjimin we must make him cry
Capivi

Stalkys reading did not include Browning or Ruskin

And besides said McTurk hes a Philistine a baskethanger He
wears a tartan tie Ruskin says that any man who wears a tartan tie
will without doubt be damned everlastingly

Bravo McTurk said Tertius I thought he was only a beast

Hes that too of course but hes worse He has a china basket with
blue ribbons and a pink kitten on it hung up in his window to grow musk
in You know when I got all that old oak carvin out of Bideford Church
when they were restoring it Ruskin says that any man wholl restore a
church is an unmitigated sweep and stuck it up here with glue Well
King came in and wanted to know whether wed done it with a fretsaw
Yah He is the King of baskethangers

Down went McTurks inky thumb over an imaginary arena full of bleeding
Kings _Placete_ child of a generous race he cried to Beetle

Well began Beetle doubtfully he comes from Balliol but Im going
to give the beast a chance You see I can always make him hop with
some more poetry He cant report me to the Head because it makes him
ridiculous Stalkys quite right But he shall have his chance

Beetle opened the book on the table ran his finger down a page and
began at random

 Or who in Moscow toward the Czar
 With the demurest of footfalls
 Over the Kremlins pavement white
 With serpentine and syenite
 Steps with five other generals

Thats no good Try another said Stalky

Hold on a shake I know whats coming McTurk was reading over
Beetles shoulder

 That simultaneously take snuff
 For each to have pretext enough
 And kerchiefwise unfold his sash
 Whichsoftness selfis yet the stuff

Gummy What a sentence

 To hold fast where a steel chain snaps
 And leave the grand white neck no gash

Full stop

Dont understand a word of it said Stalky

More fool you Construe said McTurk Those six bargees scragged the
Czar and left no evidence _Actum est_ with King

He gave me that book too said Beetle licking his lips

 Theres a great text in Galatians
 Once you trip on it entails
 Twentynine distinct damnations
 One sure if another fails

Then irrelevantly

 Setebos Setebos and Setebos
 Thinketh he liveth in the cold of the moon

Hes just come in from dinner said Dick Four looking through the
window Manders minor is with him

Safest place for Manders minor just now said Beetle

Then you chaps had better clear out said Stalky politely to the
visitors Tisnt fair to mix you up in a study row Besides we cant
afford to have evidence

Are you going to begin at once said Aladdin

Immediately if not sooner said Stalky and turned out the gas
Strong perseverin manKing Make him cry Capivi Gway Binjimin

The company retreated to their own neat and spacious study with
expectant souls

When Stalky blows out his nostrils like a horse said Aladdin to the
Emperor of China hes on the warpath Wonder what King will get

Beans said the Emperor Number Five generally pays in full

Wonder if I ought to take any notice of it officially said Abanazar
who had just remembered he was a prefect

Its none of your business Pussy Besides if you did wed have them
hostile to us and we shouldnt be able to do any work said Aladdin
Theyve begun already

Now that WestAfrican wardrum had been made to signal across estuaries
and deltas Number Five was forbidden to wake the engine within earshot
of the school But a deep devastating drone filled the passages as
McTurk and Beetle scientifically rubbed its top Anon it changed to the
blare of trumpetsof savage pursuing trumpets Then as McTurk slapped
one side smooth with the blood of ancient sacrifice the roar broke
into short coughing howls such as the wounded gorilla throws in his
native forest These were followed by the wrath of Kingthree steps
at a time up the staircase with a dry whir of the gown Aladdin and
company listening squeaked with excitement as the door crashed open
King stumbled into the darkness and cursed those performers by the gods
of Balliol and quiet repose

Turned out for a week said Aladdin holding the study door on the
crack Key to be brought down to his study in five minutes Brutes
Barbarians Savages Children Hes rather agitated Arrah Patsy
mind the baby he sang in a whisper as he clung to the doorknob
dancing a noiseless wardance

King went downstairs again and Beetle and McTurk lit the gas to confer
with Stalky But Stalky had vanished

Looks like no end of a mess said Beetle collecting his books and
mathematical instrument case A week in the formrooms isnt any
advantage to us

Yes but dont you see that Stalky isnt here you owl said McTurk
Take down the key and look sorrowful Kingll only jaw you for half an
hour Im going to read in the lower formroom

But its always me mourned Beetle

Wait till we see said McTurk hopefully I dont know any more than
you do what Stalky means but its something Go down and draw Kings
fire Youre used to it

No sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coalbox
which was also the windowseat lifted cautiously It had been a tight
fit even for the lithe Stalky his head between his knees and his
stomach under his right ear From a drawer in the table he took a
wellworn catapult a handful of buckshot and a duplicate key of the
study noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it his face
turned to the road the windsloped trees the dark levels of the
Burrows and the white line of breakers falling ninedeep along the
Pebbleridge Far down the steepbanked Devonshire lane he heard the
husky hoot of the carriers horn There was a ghost of melody in it as
it might have been the wind in a ginbottle essaying to sing Its a
way we have in the Army

Stalky smiled a tightlipped smile and at extreme range opened fire
the old horse half wheeled in the shafts

Where he gwaine tu hiccoughed RabbitsEggs Another buckshot tore
through the rotten canvas tilt with a vicious zipp

_Habet_ murmured Stalky as RabbitsEggs swore into the patient
night protesting that he saw the dommed colleger who was assaulting
him

And so King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle whom he had
kept to play with before Manders minor well knowing that it hurts
a Fifthform boy to be held up to a fags derision and so Master
Beetle in spite of all our verses which we are so proud of when
we presume to come into direct conflict with even so humble a
representative of authority as myself for instance we are turned out
of our studies are we not

Yes sir said Beetle with a sheepish grin on his lips and murder in
his heart Hope had nearly left him but he clung to a wellestablished
faith that never was Stalky so dangerous as when he was invisible

You are _not_ required to criticise thank you Turned out of our
studies we are just as if we were no better than little Manders minor
Only inky schoolboys we are and must be treated as such

Beetle pricked up his ears for RabbitsEggs was swearing savagely
on the road and some of the language entered at the upper sash King
believed in ventilation He strode to the window gowned and majestic
very visible in the gaslight

I zee un I zee un roared RabbitsEggs now that he had found a
visible foeanother shot from the darkness above Yiss yeou yeou
longnosed fowereyed gingywhiskered beggar Yeum tu old for such
goins on Aie Poultice yeour nose I tall ee Poultice yeour long
nose

Beetles heart leaped up within him Somewhere somehow he knew Stalky
moved behind these manifestations There were hope and the prospect
of revenge He would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless
verse King threw up the window and sternly rebuked RabbitsEggs But
the carrier was beyond fear or fawning He had descended from the cart
and was stooping by the roadside

It all fell swiftly as a dream Manders minor raised his hand to his
head with a cry as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich treecalf
bindings in the bookshelf Another quoited along the writingtable
Beetle made zealous feint to stop it and in that endeavor overturned
a students lamp which dripped _via_ Kings papers and some choice
books greasily on to a Persian rug There was much broken glass on the
windowseat the china basketMcTurks aversioncracked to flinders
had dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep cushions
Manders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the cheekbone and
King using strange words every one of which Beetle treasured ran
forth to find the schoolsergeant that RabbitsEggs might be instantly
cast into jail

Poor chap said Beetle with a false feigned sympathy Let it
bleed a little Thatll prevent apoplexy and he held the blind head
skilfully over the table and the papers on the table as he guided the
howling Manders to the door

Then did Beetle alone with the wreckage return good for evil How in
that office a complete set of Gibbon was scarred all along the back
as by a flint how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with
Manderss gore on the tablecloth why the big gumbottle unstoppered
had rolled semicircularly across the floor and in what manner the white
china doorknob grew to be painted with yet more of Manderss young
blood were matters which Beetle did not explain when the rabid King
returned to find him standing politely over the reeking hearthrug

You never told me to go sir he said with the air of Casabianca and
King consigned him to the outer darkness

But it was to a bootcupboard under the staircase on the ground floor
that he hastened to loose the mirth that was destroying him He had
not drawn breath for a first whoop of triumph when two hands choked him
dumb

Go to the dormitory and get me my things Bring em to Number Five
lavatory Im still in tights hissed Stalky sitting on his head
Dont run Walk

But Beetle staggered into the formroom next door and delegated his
duty to the yet unenlightened McTurk with an hysterical precis of the
campaign thus far So it was McTurk of the wooden visage who brought
the clothes from the dormitory while Beetle panted on a form Then the
three buried themselves in Number Five lavatory turned on all the taps
filled the place with steam and dropped weeping into the baths where
they pieced out the war

_Moi_ _Je_ _Ich_ _Ego_ gasped Stalky I waited till I
couldnt hear myself think while you played the drum Hid in the
coallockerand tweaked RabbitsEggsand RabbitsEggs rocked King
Wasnt it beautiful Did you hear the glass

Why hehehe shrieked McTurk one trembling finger pointed at
Beetle

Why III was through it all Beetle howled in his study being
jawed

Oh my soul said Stalky with a yell disappearing under water

Thethe glass was nothing Manders minors heads cut open
Lalalamp upset all over the rug Blood on the books and papers The
gum The gum The gum The ink The ink The ink Oh Lord

Then Stalky leaped out all pink as he was and shook Beetle into some
sort of coherence but his tale prostrated them afresh

I bunked for the bootcupboard the second I heard King go downstairs
Beetle tumbled in on top of me The spare keys hid behind the loose
board There isnt a shadow of evidence said Stalky They were all
chanting together

And he turned us out himselfhimselfhimself This from McTurk He
cant begin to suspect us Oh Stalky its the loveliest thing weve
ever done

Gum Gum Dollops of gum shouted Beetle his spectacles gleaming
through a sea of lather Ink and blood all mixed I held the little
beasts head all over the Latin proses for Monday Golly how the oil
stunk And RabbitsEggs told King to poultice his nose Did you hit
RabbitsEggs Stalky

Did I jolly well not Tweaked him all over Did you hear him curse Oh
I shall be sick in a minute if I dont stop

But dressing was a slow process because McTurk was obliged to dance
when he heard that the musk basket was broken and moreover Beetle
retailed all Kings language with emendations and purple insets

Shockin said Stalky collapsing in a helpless welter of halfhitched
trousers So dam bad too for innocent boys like us Wonder what
theyd say at St Winifreds or the World of SchoolBy gum That
reminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin Beetle when he
chivied Manders minor Come on Its an alibi Samivel and besides if
we let em off theyll be worse next time

The Lower Third had set a guard upon their formroom for the space of a
full hour which to a boy is a lifetime Now they were busy with their
Saturday evening businessescooking sparrows over the gas with
rusty nibs brewing unholy drinks in gallipots skinning moles with
pocketknives attending to paper trays full of silkworms or discussing
the iniquities of their elders with a freedom fluency and point that
would have amazed their parents The blow fell without warning Stalky
upset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils
McTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbithole
while Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with
a Smiths Classical Dictionary Three brisk minutes accounted for many
silkworms pet larvae French exercises school caps halfprepared
bones and skulls and a dozen pots of homemade sloe jam It was a great
wreckage and the formroom looked as though three conflicting tempests
had smitten it

Phew said Stalky drawing breath outside the door amid groans of
Oh you beastly caads You think yourselves awful funny and so
forth _Thats_ all right Never let the sun go down upon your wrath
Rummy little devils fags Got no notion o combinin

Six of em sat on my head when I went in after Manders minor said
Beetle I warned em what theyd get though

Everybody paid in fullbeautiful feelin said McTurk absently as
they strolled along the corridor Dont think wed better say much
about King though do you Stalky

Not _much_ Our line is injured innocence of coursesame as when the
Sergeant reported us on suspicion of smoking in the bunkers If I hadnt
thought of buyin the pepper and spillin it all over our clothes
hed have smelt us King was ghaastly facetious about that Called us
birdstuffers in form for a week

Ah King hates the Natural History Society because little Hartopp is
president Mustnt do anything in the Coll without glorifyin King
 said McTurk But he must be a putrid ass know to suppose at our time
o life wed go and stuff birds like fags

Poor old King said Beetle Hes unpopular in Commonroom and
theyll chaff his head off about RabbitsEggs Golly How lovely How
beautiful How holy But you should have seen his face when the first
rock came in _And_ the earth from the basket

So they were all stricken helpless for five minutes

They repaired at last to Abanazars study and were received reverently

Whats the matter said Stalky quick to realize new atmospheres

You know jolly well said Abanazar Youll be expelled if you get
caught King is a gibbering maniac

Who Which What Expelled for how We only played the wardrum Weve
got turned out for that already

Do you chaps mean to say you didnt make RabbitsEggs drunk and bribe
him to rock Kings rooms

Bribe him No that Ill swear we didnt said Stalky with a relieved
heart for he loved not to tell lies What a low mind youve got
Pussy Weve been down having a bath Did RabbitsEggs rock King
Strong perseverin man King Shockin

Awfly Kings frothing at the mouth Theres bell for prayers Come
on

Wait a sec said Stalky continuing the conversation in a loud and
cheerful voice as they descended the stairs What did RabbitsEggs
rock King for

I know said Beetle as they passed Kings open door I was in his
study

Hush you ass hissed the Emperor of China Oh hes gone down to
prayers said Beetle watching the shadow of the housemaster on the
wall RabbitsEggs was only a bit drunk swearin at his horse and
King jawed him through the window and then of course he rocked King

Do you mean to say said Stalky that King began it

King was behind them and every wellweighed word went up the staircase
like an arrow I can only swear said Beetle that King cursed like a
bargee Simply disgustin Im goin to write to my father about it

Better report it to Mason suggested Stalky He knows our tender
consciences Hold on a shake Ive got to tie my bootlace

The other study hurried forward They did not wish to be dragged into
stage asides of this nature So it was left to McTurk to sum up the
situation beneath the guns of the enemy

You see said the Irishman hanging on the banister he begins by
bullying little chaps then he bullies the big chaps then he bullies
some one who isnt connected with the College and then catches it
Serves him jolly well right I beg your pardon sir I didnt see you
were coming down the staircase

The black gown tore past like a thunderstorm and in its wake three
abreast arms linked the Aladdin company rolled up the big corridor to
prayers singing with most innocent intention

 Arrah Patsy mind the baby Arrah Patsy mind the child
 Wrap him up in an overcoat hes surely goin wild
 Arrah Patsy mind the baby just ye mind the child awhile
 Hell kick an bite an cry all night Arrah Patsy mind
 the child




AN UNSAVORY INTERLUDE


It was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books with the
inscription To dearest Artie on his sixteenth birthday it was
McTurk who ordered their hypothecation and it was Beetle returned from
Bideford who flung them on the windowsill of Number Five study with
news that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two Eric or
Little by Little being almost as great a drug as St Winifreds
 An I dont think much of your aunt Were nearly out of cartridges
tooArtie dear

Whereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him but McTurk sat on Stalkys
head calling him a pureminded boy till peace was declared As they
were grievously in arrears with a Latin prose as it was a blazing July
afternoon and as they ought to have been at a house cricketmatch
they began to renew their acquaintance intimate and unholy with the
volumes

Here we are said McTurk Corporal punishment produced on Eric the
worst effects He burned _not_ with remorse or regretmake a note o
that Beetle but with shame and violent indignation He glaredoh
naughty Eric Lets get to where he goes in for drink

Hold on half a shake Heres another sample The Sixth he says is
the palladium of all public schools But this lot Stalky rapped the
gilded bookcant prevent fellows drinkin and stealin an lettin
fags out of window at night anan doin what they please Golly
what weve missednot goin to St Winifreds

Im sorry to see any boys of my house taking so little interest in
their matches

Mr Prout could move very silently if he pleased though that is
no merit in a boys eyes He had flung open the studydoor without
knockinganother sinand looked at them suspiciously Very sorry
indeed I am to see you frowsting in your studies

Weve been out ever since dinner sir said McTurk wearily One
housematch is just like another and their ploy of that week happened
to be rabbitshooting with saloonpistols

I cant see a ball when its coming sir said Beetle Ive had my
giglamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused I wasnt any good even
as a fag then sir

Tuck is probably your form Tuck and brewing Why cant you three take
any interest in the honor of your house

They had heard that phrase till they were wearied The honor of the
house was Prouts weak point and they knew well how to flick him on
the raw

If you order us to go down sir of course well go said Stalky with
maddening politeness But Prout knew better than that He had tried the
experiment once at a big match when the three selfisolated stood
to attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors to whom
fags subsidized for that end pointed them out as victims of Prouts
tyranny And Prout was a sensitive man

In the infinitely petty confederacies of the Commonroom King and
Macrea fellow housemasters had borne it in upon him that by games
and games alone was salvation wrought Boys neglected were boys lost
They must be disciplined Left to himself Prout would have made
a sympathetic housemaster but he was never so left and with the
devilish insight of youth the boys knew to whom they were indebted for
his zeal

Must we go down sir said McTurk

I dont want to order you to do what a rightthinking boy should do
gladly Im sorry And he lurched out with some hazy impression that he
had sown good seed on poor ground

Now what does he suppose is the use of that said Beetle

Oh hes cracked King jaws him in Commonroom about not keepin us up
to the mark an Macrea burbles about dithcipline an old Heffy sits
between em sweatin big drops I heard Oke the Commonroom butler
talking to Richards Prouts houseservant about it down in the
basement the other day when I went down to bag some bread said Stalky

What did Oke say demanded McTurk throwing Eric into a corner

Oh he said They make more nise nor a nest full o jackdaws an half
of it like wed no ears to our heads that waited on em They talks over
old Proutwhat heve done an left undone about his boys An how their
boys be fine boys an hisn be dom bad Well Oke talked like that
you know and Richards got awfly wrathy He has a down on King for
something or other Wonder why

Why King talks about Prout in formroommakes allusions an all
thatonly half the chaps are such asses they cant see what hes
drivin at And dyou remember what he said about the Casual House
last Tuesday He meant us They say he says perfectly beastly things to
his own house making fun of Prouts said Beetle

Well we didnt come here to mix up in their rows McTurk said
wrathfully Wholl bathe after callover Kings takin it in the
cricketfield Come on Turkey seized his straw and led the way

They reached the sunblistered pavilion over against the gray
Pebbleridge just before rollcall and asking no questions gathered
from Kings voice and manner that his house was on the road to victory

Ah ha said he turning to show the light of his countenance Here
we have the ornaments of the Casual House at last You consider cricket
beneath you I believe the crowd flannelled sniggered and from
what I have seen this afternoon I fancy many others of your house hold
the same view And may I ask what you purpose to do with your noble
selves till teatime

Going down to bathe sir said Stalky

And whence this sudden zeal for cleanliness There is nothing about you
that particularly suggests it Indeed so far as I rememberI may be at
faultbut a short time ago

Five years sir said Beetle hotly

King scowled _One_ of you was that thing called a waterfunk Yes
a waterfunk So now you wish to wash It is well Cleanliness never
injured a boy ora house We will proceed to business and he
addressed himself to the callover board

What the deuce did you say anything to him for Beetle said McTurk
angrily as they strolled towards the big open seabaths

Twasnt fairremindin one of bein a waterfunk My first term too
Heaps of chaps arewhen they cant swim

Yes you ass but he saw hed fetched you You ought never to answer
King

But it wasnt fair Stalky

My Hat Youve been here six years and you expect fairness Well you
are a dithering idiot

A knot of Kings boys also bound for the baths hailed them beseeching
them to washfor the honor of their house

Thats what comes of Kings jawin and messin Those young animals
wouldnt have thought of it unless hed put it into their heads Now
theyll be funny about it for weeks said Stalky Dont take any
notice

The boys came nearer shouting an opprobrious word At last they moved
to windward ostentatiously holding their noses

Thats pretty said Beetle Theyll be sayin our house stinks next

When they returned from the baths dampheaded languid at peace with
the world Beetles forecast came only too true They were met in the
corridor by a faga common LowerSecond fagwho at arms length
handed them a carefully wrapped piece of soap with the compliments of
Kings House

Hold on said Stalky checking immediate attack Who put you up
to this Nixon Rattray and White Those were two leaders in Kings
house Thank you Theres no answer

Oh its too sickening to have this kind o rot shoved on to a chap
Whats the sense of it Whats the fun of it said McTurk

It will go on to the end of the term though Beetle wagged his head
sorrowfully He had worn many jests threadbare on his own account

In a few days it became an established legend of the school that Prouts
house did not wash and were therefore noisome Mr King was pleased to
smile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from Beetle
with certain gestures

There seems to be some disability attaching to you my Beetle or else
why should Burton major withdraw so to speak the hem of his garments
I confess I am still in the dark Will some one be good enough to
enlighten me

Naturally he was enlightened by half the form

Extraordinary Most extraordinary However each house has its
traditions with which I would not for the world interfere
_We_ have a prejudice in favor of washing Go on Beetlefrom
_jugurtha tamen_and if you can avoid the more flagrant forms of
guessing

Prouts house was furious because Macreas and Hartopps houses joined
Kings to insult them They called a housemeeting after dinneran
excited and angry meeting of all save the prefects whose dignity
though they sympathized did not allow them to attend They read
ungrammatical resolutions and made speeches beginning Gentlemen we
have met on this occasion and ending with Its a beastly shame
 precisely as houses have done since time and schools began

Number Five study attended with its usual air of bland patronage At
last McTurk of the lanthorn jaws delivered himself

You jabber and jaw and burble and thats about all you can do Whats
the good of it Kings housell only gloat because theyve drawn
you and King will gloat too Besides that resolution of Orrins is
chockfull of bad grammar and Kingll gloat over that

I thought you an Beetle would put it right anan wed post it in
the corridor said the composer meekly

_Par si je le connai_ Im not goin to meddle with the biznai said
Beetle Its a gloat for Kings house Turkeys quite right

Well wont Stalky then

But Stalky puffed out his cheeks and squinted down his nose in the style
of Panurge and all he said was Oh you abject burblers

Youre three beastly scabs was the instant retort of the democracy
and they went out amid execrations

This is piffling said McTurk Lets get our sallies and go and
shoot bunnies

Three saloonpistols with a supply of bulleted breechcaps were stored
in Stalkys trunk and this trunk was in their dormitory and
their dormitory was a threebed attic one opening out of a tenbed
establishment which in turn communicated with the great range of
dormitories that ran practically from one end of the College to the
other Macreas house lay next to Prouts Kings next to Macreas and
Hartopps beyond that again Carefully locked doors divided house from
house but each house in its internal arrangementsthe College had
originally been a terrace of twelve large houseswas a replica of the
next one straight roof covering all

They found Stalkys bed drawn out from the wall to the left of the
dormer window and the latter end of Richards protruding from a
twofootsquare cupboard in the wall

Whats all this Ive never noticed it before What are you tryin to
do Fatty

Fillin basins Muster Corkran Richardss voice was hollow and
muffled Theyve been savin me trouble Yiss

Looks like it said McTurk Hi Youll stick if you dont take
care

Richards backed puffing

I cant rache un Yiss tess a turncock Muster McTurk Theyve took
an runned all the watterpipes a storey higher in the housesrunned
em all along under the ang of the heaves like Runned em in last
holidays _I_ cant rache the turncock

Let me try said Stalky diving into the aperture

Slip ee to the left then Muster Corkran Slip ee to the left an
feel in the dark

To the left Stalky wriggled and saw a long line of lead pipe
disappearing up a triangular tunnel whose roof was the rafters and
boarding of the college roof whose floor was sharpedged joists and
whose side was the rough studding of the lath and plaster wall under the
dormer

Rummy show How far does it go

Right along Muster Corkranright along from end to end Her runs
under the ang of the heaves Have ee rached the stopcock yet Mr King
got un put in to save us carryin watter from downstairs to fill the
basins No place for a lusty man like old Richards Im tu thickabout to
go ferritin Thank ee Muster Corkran

The water squirted through the tap just inside the cupboard and having
filled the basins the grateful Richards waddled away

The boys sat roundeyed on their beds considering the possibilities of
this trove Two floors below them they could hear the hum of the angry
house for nothing is so still as a dormitory in midafternoon of a
midsummer term

It has been papered over till now McTurk examined the little door
If wed only known before

I vote we go down and explore No one will come up this time o day We
neednt keep _cave_

They crawled in Stalky leading drew the door behind them and on all
fours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster odd shavings
and all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house
The passage was perhaps three feet wide and except for the struggling
light round the edges of the cupboards there was one to each dormer
almost pitchy dark

Heres Macreas house said Stalky his eye at the crack of the third
cupboard I can see Barness name on his trunk Dont make such a row
Beetle We can get right to the end of the Coll Come on Were in
Kings house nowI can see a bit of Rattrays trunk How these beastly
boards hurt ones knees They heard his nails scraping on plaster

Thats the ceiling below Look out If we smashed that the plaster ud
fall down in the lower dormitory said Beetle

Lets whispered McTurk

An be collared first thing Not much Why I can shove my hand ever so
far up between these boards

Stalky thrust an arm to the elbow between the joists

No good stayin here I vote we go back and talk it over Its a crummy
place Must say Im grateful to King for his waterworks

They crawled out brushed one another clean slid the saloonpistols
down a trouserleg and hurried forth to a deep and solitary Devonshire
lane in whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit They
threw themselves down under the rank elder bushes and began to think
aloud

You know said Stalky at last sighting at a distant sparrow we
could hide our sallies in there like anything

Huh Beetle snorted choked and gurgled He had been silent since
they left the dormitory Did you ever read a book called The History
of a House or something I got it out of the library the other day A
French woman wrote itViolet somebody But its translated you know
and its very interestin Tells you how a house is built

Well if youre in a sweat to find out that you can go down to the new
cottages theyre building for the coastguard

My Hat I will He felt in his pockets Give me tuppence some one

Rot Stay here and dont mess about in the sun

Gi me tuppence

I say Beetle you arent stuffy about anything are you said McTurk
handing over the coppers His tone was serious for though Stalky often
and McTurk occasionally manoeuvred on his own account Beetle had never
been known to do so in all the history of the confederacy

No Im not Im thinking

Well well come too said Stalky with a generals suspicion of his
aides

Dont want you

Oh leave him alone Hes been taken worse with a poem said McTurk
Hell go burbling down to the Pebbleridge and spit it all up in the
study when he comes back

Then why did he want the tuppence Turkey Hes gettin too beastly
independent Hi Theres a bunny No it aint Its a cat by Jove You
plug first

Twenty minutes later a boy with a straw hat at the back of his head and
his hands in his pockets was staring at workmen as they moved about
a halffinished cottage He produced some ferocious tobacco and
was passed from the forecourt into the interior where he asked many
questions

Well lets have your beastly epic said Turkey as they burst into
the study to find Beetle deep in ViolletleDuc and some drawings
Weve had no end of a lark

Epic What epic Ive been down to the coastguard

No epic Then we will slay you O Beetle said Stalky moving to the
attack Youve got something up your sleeve _I_ know when you talk in
that tone

Your Uncle Beetlewith an attempt to imitate Stalkys warvoiceis
a great man

Oh no he jolly well isnt anything of the kind You deceive yourself
Beetle Scrag him Turkey

A great man Beetle gurgled from the floor _You_ are futilelook
out for my tiefutile burblers I am the Great Man I gloat Ouch
Hear me

Beetle deahStalky dropped unreservedly on Beetles chestwe love
you an youre a poet If I ever said you were a doggaroo I apologize
but you know as well as we do that you cant do anything by yourself
without mucking it

Ive got a notion

And youll spoil the whole show if you dont tell your Uncle Stalky
Cough it up ducky and well see what we can do Notion you fat
impostorI knew you had a notion when you went away Turkey said it was
a poem

Ive found out how houses are built Le me get up The floorjoists of
one room are the ceilingjoists of the room below

Dont be so filthy technical

Well the man told me The floor is laid on top of those joiststhose
boards on edge that we crawled overbut the floor stops at a partition
Well if you get behind a partition same as you did in the attic dont
you see that you can shove anything you please under the floor between
the floorboards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below Look
here Ive drawn it

He produced a rude sketch sufficient to enlighten the allies There is
no part of the modern school curriculum that deals with architecture
and none of them had yet reflected whether floors and ceilings were
hollow or solid Outside his own immediate interests the boy is as
ignorant as the savage he so admires but he has also the savages
resource

I see said Stalky I shoved my hand there An then

An then Theyve been calling us stinkers you know We might shove
somethin undersulphur or something that stunk pretty badan stink
em out I know it can be done somehow Beetles eyes turned to Stalky
handling the diagrams

Stinks said Stalky interrogatively Then his face grew luminous with
delight By gum Ive got it Horrid stinks Turkey He leaped at the
Irishman This afternoonjust after Beetle went away _Shes_ the very
thing

Come to my arms my beamish boy caroled McTurk and they fell into
each others arms dancing Oh frabjous day Calloo callay She will
She will

Hold on said Beetle I dont understand

Dearr man It shall though Oh Artie my puresouled youth let us
tell our darling Reggie about Pestiferous Stinkadores

Not until after callover Come on

I say said Orrin stiffly as they fell into their places along the
walls of the gymnasium The house are goin to hold another meeting

Hold away then Stalkys mind was elsewhere

Its about you three this time

All right give em my love _Here sir_ and he tore down the
corridor

Gamboling like kids at play with bounds and sidestarts with caperings
and curvetings they led the almost bursting Beetle to the rabbitlane
and from under a pile of stones drew forth the newslain corpse of a
cat Then did Beetle see the inner meaning of what had gone before and
lifted up his voice in thanksgiving for that the world held warriors so
wise as Stalky and McTurk

Wellnourished old lady aint she said Stalky How long dyou
suppose itll take her to get a bit whiff in a confined space

Bit whiff What a coarse brute you are said McTurk Cant a poor
pussycat get under Kings dormitory floor to die without your pursuin
her with your foul innuendoes

What did she die under the floor for said Beetle looking to the
future

Oh they wont worry about that when they find her said Stalky

A cat may look at a king McTurk rolled down the bank at his own
jest Pussy you dont know how useful youre goin to be to three
puresouled highminded boys

Theyll have to take up the floor for her same as they did in Number
Nine when the rat croaked Big medicineheap big medicine Phew Oh
Lord I wish I could stop laughin said Beetle

Stinks Hi stinks Clammy ones McTurk gasped as he regained his
place Andthe exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down
together in a tangleits all for the honor of the house too

An theyre holdin another meetingon us Stalky panted his knees
in the ditch and his face in the long grass Well lets get the bullet
out of her and hurry up The sooner shes bedded out the better

Between them they did some grisly work with a penknife between them
ask not who buttoned her to his bosom they took up the corpse and
hastened back Stalky arranging their plan of action at the full trot

The afternoon sun lying in broad patches on the bedrugs saw three
boys and an umbrella disappear into a dormitory wall In five minutes
they emerged brushed themselves all over washed their hands combed
their hair and descended

Are you sure you shoved her far enough under said McTurk suddenly

Hang it man I shoved her the full length of my arm and Beetles
brolly That must be about six feet Shes bung in the middle of Kings
big upper tenbedder Eligible central situation _I_ call it Shell
stink out his chaps and Hartopps and Macreas when she really begins
to fume I swear your Uncle Stalky is a great man Do you realize what a
great man he is Beetle

Well I had the notion first hadnt I only

You couldnt do it without your Uncle Stalky could you

Theyve been calling us stinkers for a week now said McTurk Oh
_wont_ they catch it

Stinker Yah Stinkah rang down the corridor

And shes there said Stalky a hand on either boys shoulder
Sheisthere gettin ready to surprise em Presently shell begin
to whisper to em in their dreams Then shell whiff Golly how shell
whiff Oblige me by thinkin of it for two minutes

They went to their study in more or less of silence There they began to
laughlaugh as only boys can They laughed with their foreheads on the
tables or on the floor laughed at length curled over the backs of
chairs or clinging to a bookshelf laughed themselves limp

And in the middle of it Orrin entered on behalf of the house Dont
mind us Orrin sit down You dont know how we respect and admire you
Theres something about your pure high young forehead full of the
dreams of innocent boyhood thats no end fetchin It is indeed

The house sent me to give you this He laid a folded sheet of paper on
the table and retired with an awful front

Its the resolution Oh read it some one Im too sillysick
with laughin to see said Beetle Stalky jerked it open with a
precautionary sniff Phew Phew Listen _The house notices with pain
and contempt the attitude of indiference_ how many fs in
indifference Beetle

Two for choice

Only one hereadopted by the occupants of Number Five study in
relation to the insults offered to Mr Prouts house at the recent
meeting in Number Twelve formroom and the House hereby pass a
vote of censure on the said study Thats all

And she bled all down my shirt too said Beetle

An Im catty all over said McTurk though I washed twice

An I nearly broke Beetles brolly plantin her where she would
blossom

The situation was beyond speech but not laughter There was some
attempt that night to demonstrate against the three in their dormitory
so they came forth

You see Beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces the trouble
with you is that youre a set of unthinkin asses Youve no more brains
than spidgers Weve told you that heaps of times havent we

Well give the three of you a dormitory lickin You always jaw at us
as if you were prefects cried one

Oh no you wont said Stalky because you know that if you did
youd get the worst of it sooner or later _We_ arent in any hurry We
can afford to wait for our little revenges Youve made howlin asses
of yourselves and just as soon as King gets hold of your precious
resolutions tomorrow youll find that out If you arent sick an sorry
by tomorrow night IllIll eat my hat

But or ever the dinnerbell rang the next day Prouts were sadly aware
of their error King received stray members of that house with an
exaggerated attitude of fear Did they purpose to cause him to be
dismissed from the College by unanimous resolution What were their
views concerning the government of the school that he might hasten
to give effect to them he would not offend them for worlds but
he fearedhe sadly fearedthat his own house who did not pass
resolutions but washed might somewhat deride

King was a happy man and his house basking in the favor of his smile
made that afternoon a long penance to the misled Prouts And Prout
himself with a dull and lowering visage tried to think out the rights
and wrongs of it all only plunging deeper into bewilderment Why should
his house be called Stinkers Truly it was a small thing but he had
been trained to believe that straws show which way the wind blows and
that there is no smoke without fire He approached King in Commonroom
with a sense of injustice but King was pleased to be full of airy
persiflage that tide and brilliantly danced dialectical rings round
Prout

Now said Stalky at bedtime making pilgrimage through the dormitories
before the prefects came by _now_ what have you got to say for
yourselves Foster Carton Finch Longbridge Marlin Brett I heard
you chaps catchin it from Kinghe made hay of youan all you could
do was to wriggle an grin an say Yes sir an No sir an Oh
sir an Please sir You an your resolution Urh

Oh shut up Stalky

Not a bit of it Youre a gaudy lot of resolutionists you are Youve
made a sweet mess of it Perhaps youll have the decency to leave us
alone next time

Here the house grew angry and in many voices pointed out how this
blunder would never have come to pass if Number Five study had helped
them from the first

But you chaps are so beastly conceited anan you swaggered into the
meetin as if we were a lot of idiots growled Orrin of the resolution

Thats precisely what you are Thats what weve been tryin to hammer
into your thick heads all this time said Stalky Never mind well
forgive you Cheer up You cant help bein asses you know and the
enemys flank deftly turned Stalky hopped into bed

That night was the first of sorrow among the jubilant Kings By some
accident of underfloor drafts the cat did not vex the dormitory beneath
which she lay but the next one to the right stealing on the air rather
as a paleblue sensation than as any poignant offense But the mere
adumbration of an odor is enough for the sensitive nose and clean tongue
of youth Decency demands that we draw several carbolized sheets over
what the dormitory said to Mr King and what Mr King replied He was
genuinely proud of his house and fastidious in all that concerned their
wellbeing He came he sniffed he said things Next morning a boy in
that dormitory confided to his bosom friend a fag of Macreas that
there was trouble in their midst which King would fain keep secret

But Macreas boy had also a bosom friend in Prouts a shockheaded
fag of malignant disposition who when he had wormed out the secret
toldtold it in a highpitched treble that rang along the corridor like
a bats squeak

Anan theyve been calling us stinkers all this week Why Harland
minor says they simply cant sleep in his dormitory for the stink Come
on

With one shout and with one cry Prouts juniors hurled themselves into
the war and through the interval between first and second lesson some
fifty twelveyearolds were embroiled on the gravel outside Kings
windows to a tune whose _leitmotif_ was the word stinker

Hark to the minutegun at sea said Stalky They were in their study
collecting books for second lessonLatin with King I thought his
azure brow was a bit cloudy at prayers She is comin sister Mary She
is

If they make such a row now what will they do when she really begins
to look up an take notice

Well no vulgar repartee Beetle All we want is to keep out of this
row like gentlemen

Tis but a little faded flower Wheres my Horace Look here I dont
understand what she means by stinkin out Rattrays dormitory first We
holed in under Whites didnt we asked McTurk with a wrinkled brow

Skittish little thing Shes rompin about all over the place I
suppose

My Aunt Kingll be a cheerful customer at second lesson I havent
prepared my Horace one little bit either said Beetle Come on

They were outside the formroom door now It was within five minutes of
the bell and King might arrive at any moment

Turkey elbowed into a cohort of scuffling fags cut out Thornton tertius
he that had been Harlands bosom friend and bade him tell his tale

It was a simple one interrupted by tears Many of Kings house had
already battered him for libel

Oh its nothing McTurk cried He says that Kings house stinks
Thats all

Stale Stalky shouted We knew that years ago only we didnt
choose to run about shoutin stinker Weve got some manners ir they
havent Catch a fag Turkey and make sure of it

Turkeys long arm closed on a hurried and anxious ornament of the Lower
Second

Oh McTurk please let me go I dont stinkI swear I dont

Guilty conscience cried Beetle Who said you did

What dyou make of it Stalky punted the small boy into Beetles arms

Snf Snf He does though I think its leprosyor thrush Praps its
both Take it away

Indeed Master BeetleKing generally came to the housedoor for a
minute or two as the bell rangwe are vastly indebted to you for your
diagnosis which seems to reflect almost as much credit on the natural
unwholesomeness of your mind as it does upon your pitiful ignorance of
the diseases of which you discourse so glibly We will however test
your knowledge in other directions

That was a merry lesson but in his haste to scarify Beetle King
clean neglected to give him an imposition and since at the same time
he supplied him with many priceless adjectives for later use Beetle was
well content and applied himself most seriously throughout third
lesson algebra with little Hartopp to composing a poem entitled The
Lazarhouse

After dinner King took his house to bathe in the sea off the
Pebbleridge It was an old promise but he wished he could have evaded
it for all Prouts lined up by the Fives Court and cheered with
intention In his absence not less than half the school invaded the
infected dormitory to draw their own conclusions The cat had gained in
the last twelve hours but a battlefield of the fifth day could not have
been so flamboyant as the spies reported

My word she _is_ doin herself proud said Stalky Did you ever
smell anything like it Ah an she isnt under Whites dormitory at all
yet

But she will be Give her time said Beetle Shell twine like
a giddy honeysuckle What howlin Lazarites they are No house is
justified in makin itself a stench in the nostrils of decent

Highminded puresouled boys Do you burn with remorse and regret
 said McTurk as they hastened to meet the house coming up from the sea
King had deserted it so speech was unfettered Round its front played
a crowd of skirmishersall houses mixedflying reforming shrieking
insults On its tortured flanks marched the Hoplites seniors hurling
jests one after anothersimple and primitive jests of the Stone Age
To these the three added themselves dispassionately with an air of
aloofness almost sadly

And they look all right too said Stalky It cant be Rattray can
it Rattray

No answer

Rattray dear He seems stuffy about something or other Look here old
man we dont bear any malice about your sending that soap to us last
week do we Be cheerful Rat You can live this down all right I dare
say its only a few fags Your house is so beastly slack though

You arent going back to the house are you said McTurk The victims
desired nothing better Youve simply no conception of the reek up
there Of course frowzin as you do you wouldnt notice it but after
this nice wash and the clean fresh air even youd be upset Much
better camp on the Burrows Well get you some straw Shall we The
house hurried in to the tune of John Browns body sung by loving
schoolmates and barricaded themselves in their formroom Straightway
Stalky chalked a large cross with Lord have mercy upon us on the
door and left King to find it

The wind shifted that night and wafted a carrionreek into Macreas
dormitories so that boys in nightgowns pounded on the locked door
between the houses entreating Kings to wash Number Five study went to
second lesson with not more than half a pound of camphor apiece in their
clothing and King too wary to ask for explanations gibbered a while
and hurled them forth So Beetle finished yet another poem at peace in
the study

Theyre usin carbolic now Malpas told me said Stalky King thinks
its the drains

Shell need a lot o carbolic said McTurk No harm tryin I
suppose It keeps King out of mischief

I swear I thought he was goin to kill me when I sniffed just now He
didnt mind Burton major sniffin at me the other day though He never
stopped Alexander howlin Stinker into our formroom beforebefore
we doctored em He just grinned said Stalky What was he frothing
over you for Beetle

Aha That was my subtle jape I had him on toast You know he always
jaws about the learned Lipsius

Who at the age of fourthat chap said McTurk

Yes Whenever he hears Ive written a poem Well just as I was sittin
down I whispered How is our learned Lepsius to Burton major Old
Butt grinned like an owl _He_ didnt know what I was drivin at but
King jolly well did That was really why he hove us out Aint you
grateful Now shut up Im goin to write the Ballad of the Learned
Lipsius

Keep clear of anything coarse then said Stalky I shouldnt like to
be coarse on this happy occasion

Not for woorlds What rhymes to stenches someone

In Commonroom at lunch King discoursed acridly to Prout of boys with
prurient minds who perverted their few and baleful talents to sap
discipline and corrupt their equals to deal in foul imagery and destroy
reverence

But you didnt seem to consider this when your house called
usahstinkers If you hadnt assured me that you never interfere with
another mans house I should almost believe that it was a few casual
remarks of yours that started all this nonsense

Prout had endured much for King always took his temper to meals

You spoke to Beetle yourself didnt you Something about not bathing
and being a waterfunk the school chaplain put in I was scoring in
the pavilion that day

I may havejestingly I really dont pretend to remember every remark
I let fall among small boys and full well I know the Beetle has no
feelings to be hurt

May be but he or theyit comes to to same thinghave the fiends
own knack of discovering a mans weak place I confess I rather go out
of my way to conciliate Number Five study It may be soft but so far
I believe I am the only man here whom they havent maddened by
theirwellattentions

That is all beside the point I flatter myself I can deal with them
alone as occasion arises But if they feel themselves morally supported
by those who should wield an absolute and openhanded justice then I
say that my lot is indeed a hard one Of all things I detest I admit
that anything verging on disloyalty among ourselves is the first

The Commonroom looked at one another out of the corners of their eyes
and Prout blushed

I deny it absolutely he said Erin fact I own that I personally
object to all three of them It is not fair therefore to

How long do you propose to allow it said King

But surely said Macrea deserting his usual ally the blame if
there be any rests with you King You cant hold them responsible
for theyou prefer the good old AngloSaxon I believestink in your
house My boys are complaining of it now

What can you expect You know what boys are Naturally they take
advantage of what to them is a heavensent opportunity said little
Hartopp What _is_ the trouble in your dormitories King

Mr King explained that as he had made it the one rule of his life never
to interfere with another mans house so he expected not to be too
patently interfered with They might be interested to learnhere the
chaplain heaved a weary sighthat he had taken all steps that in his
poor judgment would meet the needs of the case Nay further he had
himself expended with no thought of reimbursement sums the amount of
which he would not specify on disinfectants This he had done because
he knew by bitterby most bitterexperience that the management of the
college was slack dilatory and inefficient He might even add almost
as slack as the administration of certain houses which now thought
fit to sit in judgment on his actions With a short summary of his
scholastic career and a precis of his qualifications including his
degrees he withdrew slamming the door

Heigho said the chaplain Ours is a dwarfing lifea belittling
life my brethren God help all schoolmasters They need it

I dont like the boys I ownProut dug viciously with his fork into
the tableclothand I dont pretend to be a strong man as you know
But I confess I cant see any reason why I should take steps against
Stalky and the others because King happens to be annoyed byby

Falling into the pit he has digged said little Hartopp Certainly
not Prout No one accuses you of setting one house against another
through sheer idleness

A belittling lifea belittling life The chaplain rose I go to
correct French exercises By dinner King will have scored off some
unlucky child of thirteen he will repeat to us every word of his
brilliant repartees and all will be well

But about those three Are they so prurientminded

Nonsense said little Hartopp If you thought for a minute Prout
you would see that the precocious flow of fetid imagery that King
complains of is borrowed wholesale from King He nursed the pinion
that impelled the steel Naturally he does not approve Come into the
smokingroom for a minute It isnt fair to listen to boys but they
should be now rubbing it into Kings house outside Little things please
little minds

The dingy den off the Commonroom was never used for anything except
gowns Its windows were ground glass one could not see out of it but
one could hear almost every word on the gravel outside A light and wary
footstep came up from Number Five

Rattray in a subdued voiceRattrays study fronted that way Dyou
know if Mr Kings anywhere about Ive got a McTurk discreetly left
the end of the sentence open

No hes gone out said Rattray unguardedly

Ah The learned Lipsius is airing himself is he His Royal Highness
has gone to fumigate McTurk climbed on the railings where he held
forth like the neverwearied rook

Now in all the Coll there was no stink like the stink of Kings house
for it stank vehemently and none knew what to make of it Save King And
he washed the fags _privatim et seriatim_ In the fishpools of Hesbon
washed he them with an apron about his loins

Shut up you mad Irishman There was the sound of a golfball spurting
up gravel

Its no good getting wrathy Rattray Weve come to jape with you Come
on Beetle Theyre all at home You can wind em

Wheres the Pomposo Stinkadore Tisnt safe for a puresouled
highminded boy to be seen round his house these days Gone out has he
Never mind Ill do the best I can Rattray Im _in loco parentis_ just
now

One for you Prout whispered Macrea for this was Mr Prouts pet
phrase

I have a few words to impart to you my young friend We will discourse
together a while

Here the listening Prout sputtered Beetle in a strained voice had
chosen a favorite gambit of Kings

I repeat Master Rattray we will confer and the matter of our
discourse shall not be stinks for that is a loathsome and obscene
word We will with your good leavegranted I trust Master Rattray
granted I truststudy thisthis scabrous upheaval of latent
demoralization What impresses me most is not so much the blatant
indecency with which you swagger abroad under your load of putrescence
 you must imagine this discourse punctuated with golfballs but old
Rattray was ever a bad shot as the cynical immorality with which you
revel in your abhorrent aromas Far be it from me to interfere with
anothers house

Good Lord said Prout but this is King

Line for line letter for letter listen said little Hartopp

But to say that you stink as certain lewd fellows of the baser sort
aver is to say nothingless than nothing In the absence of your
beloved housemaster for whom no one has a higher regard than myself
I will if you will allow me explain the grossnessthe unparalleled
enormitythe appalling fetor of the stenches I believe in the good old
AngloSaxon word stenches sir with which you have seen fit to infect
your house Oh bother Ive forgotten the rest but it was very
beautiful Arent you grateful to us for laborin with you this way
Rattray Lots of chaps ud never have taken the trouble but were
grateful Rattray

Yes were horrid grateful grunted McTurk We dont forget that
soap Were polite Why aint you polite Rat

Hallo Stalky cantered up his cap over one eye Exhortin the
Whiffers eh Im afraid theyre too far gone to repent Rattray
White Perowne Malpas No answer This is distressin This is truly
distressin Bring out your dead you glandered lepers

You think yourself funny dont you said Rattray stung from his
dignity by this last Its only a rat or something under the floor
Were going to have it up tomorrow

Dont try to shuffle it off on a poor dumb animal and dead too I
loathe prevarication Pon my soul Rattray

Hold on The Hartoffles never said Pon my soul in all his little
life said Beetle critically

Ah said Prout to little Hartopp

Upon my word sir upon my word sir I expected better things of you
Rattray Why can you not own up to your misdeeds like a man Have _I_
ever shown any lack of confidence in _you_

Its not brutality murmured little Hartopp as though answering a
question no one had asked Its boy only boy

And this was the house Stalky changed from a pecking fluttering
voice to tragic earnestness This was thetheopen cesspit that dared
to call us stinkers And nowand now it tries to shelter itself
behind a dead rat You annoy me Rattray You disgust me You irritate
me unspeakably Thank Heaven I am a man of equable temper

This is to your address Macrea said Prout

I fear so I fear so

Or I should scarcely be able to contain myself before your mocking
visage

_Cave_ in an undertone Beetle had spied King sailing down the
corridor

And what may you be doing here my little friends the housemaster
began I had a fleeting notioncorrect me if I am wrong the
listeners with one accord chokedthat if I found you outside my house
I should visit you with dire pains and penalties

We were just goin for a walk sir said Beetle

And you stopped to speak to Rattray _en route_

Yes sir Weve been throwing golfballs said Rattray coming out of
the study

Old Rat is more of a diplomat than I thought So far he is strictly
within the truth said little Hartopp Observe the ethics of it
Prout

Oh you were sporting with them were you I must say I do not envy
you your choice of associates I fancied they might have been engaged in
some of the prurient discourse with which they have been so disgustingly
free of late I should strongly advise you to direct your steps most
carefully in the future Pick up those golfballs He passed on


Next day Richards who had been a carpenter in the Navy and to whom odd
jobs were confided was ordered to take up a dormitory floor for Mr
King held that something must have died there

We need not neglect all our work for a trumpery incident of this
nature though I am quite aware that little things please little
minds Yes I have decreed the boards to be taken up after lunch under
Richardss auspices I have no doubt it will be vastly interesting to
a certain type of socalled intellect but any boy of my house or
anothers found on the dormitory stairs will _ipso facto_ render himself
liable to three hundred lines

The boys did not collect on the stairs but most of them waited outside
Kings Richards had been bound to cry the news from the attic window
and if possible to exhibit the corpse

Tis a cat a dead cat Richardss face showed purple at the window
He had been in the chamber of death and on his knees for some time

Cat be blowed cried McTurk Its a dead fag left over from last
term Three cheers for Kings dead fag

They cheered lustily

Show it show it Lets have a squint at it yelled the juniors Give
her to the Bughunters This was the Natural History Society The
cat looked at the Kingand died of it Hoosh Yai Yaow Maiow Ftzz
 were some of the cries that followed

Again Richards appeared

Sheve beenhe checked himself suddenlydead a long taime

The school roared

Well come on out for a walk said Stalky in a wellchosen pause
Its all very disgustin and I do hope the Lazarhouse wont do it
again

Do what a Kings boy cried furiously

Kill a poor innocent cat every time you want to get off washing Its
awfully hard to distinguish between you as it is I prefer the cat I
must say She isnt quite so whiff What are you goin to do Beetle

_Je vais gloater Je vais gloater tout le blessed afternoon Jamais
jai gloate comme je gloaterai aujourdhui Nous bunkerons aux_
bunkers

And it seemed good to them so to do


Down in the basement where the gas flickers and the boots stand in
racks Richards amid his blackingbrushes held forth to Oke of the
Commonroom Gumbly of the dininghalls and fair Lena of the laundry

Yiss Her were in a shockin staate an condition Her nigh made me
sick I tal ee But I rowted un out and I rowted un out an I made
all shipshape though her smelt like to bilges

Her died mousin I reckon poor thing said Lena

Then her moused different to any made cat o Gods world Lena I up
with the topboard an she were lying on her back an I turned un
ovver with the brumehandle an twas her back was all covered with
the plaster from twixt the lathin Yiss I tal ee An under her
head there lay like sos to say a little pillow o plaster druv up
in front of her by raison of her slidin along on her back No cat niver
went mousin on her back Lena Some one had shoved her along right
underneath so far as they could shove un Cats dont make theyselves
pillows for to die on Shoved along she were when she was settin for
to be cold laike

Oh yeoum too clever to live Fatty Yeou go get wed an taught some
sense said Lena the affianced of Gumbly

Larned a little fore iver some maidens was born Sarved in the Queens
Navy I have where yeoum taught to use your eyes Yeou go tend your
own business Lena

Do ee mean what youm been tellin us said Oke

Ask me no questions Ill give ee no lies Bullethole clane thru from
side to side an tu heartribs broke like withies I seed un when I
turned un ovver Theyre clever oh theym clever but theym not too
clever for old Richards Twas on the born tip o my tongue to tell
tu but he said us niver washed he did Let his dom boys call us
stinkers he did Sarve un dom well raight I say

Richards spat on a fresh boot and fell to his work chuckling




THE IMPRESSIONISTS


They had dropped into the chaplains study for a Saturday night
smokeall four housemastersand the three briars and the one cigar
reeking in amity proved the Rev John Gilletts good generalship Since
the discovery of the cat King had been too ready to see affront
where none was meant and the Reverend John bufferstate and general
confidant had worked for a week to bring about a good understanding
He was fat cleanshaven except for a big mustache of an imperturbable
good temper and those who loved him least said a guileful Jesuit
He smiled benignantly upon his handiworkfour sorely tried men talking
without very much malice

Now remember he said when the conversation turned that way I
impute nothing But every time that any one has taken direct steps
against Number Five study the issue has been more or less humiliating
to the taker

I cant admit that I pulverize the egregious Beetle daily for his
souls good and the others with him said King

Well take your own case King and go back a couple of years Do
you remember when Prout and you were on their track for hutting and
trespass wasnt it Have you forgotten Colonel Dabney

The others laughed King did not care to be reminded of his career as a
poacher

That was one instance Again when you had rooms below themI always
said that that was entering the lions denyou turned them out

For making disgusting noises Surely Gillett you dont excuse

All I say is that you turned them out That same evening your study was
wrecked

By RabbitsEggsmost beastly drunkfrom the road said King What
has that

The Reverend John went on

Lastly they conceive that aspersions are cast upon their personal
cleanlinessa most delicate matter with all boys Very good Observe
how in each case the punishment fits the crime A week after your
house calls them stinkers King your house is not to put too fine a
point on it stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to die in the one
spot where she can annoy you most Again the long arm of coincidence
_Summa_ You accuse them of trespass Through some absurd chain of
circumstancesthey may or may not be at the other end of ityou and
Prout are made to appear as trespassers You evict them For a time your
study is made untenable I have drawn the parallel in the last case
Well

She was under the centre of Whites dormitory said King There are
double floorboards there to deaden noise No boy even in my own house
could possibly have pried up the boards without leaving some traceand
RabbitsEggs was phenomenally drunk that other night

They are singularly favored by fortune That is all I ever said
Personally I like them immensely and I believe I have a little of
their confidence I confess I like being called Padre They are at
peace with me consequently I am not treated to bogus confessions of
theft

You mean Masons case said Prout heavily That always struck me
as peculiarly scandalous I thought the Head should have taken up the
matter more thoroughly Mason may be misguided but at least he is
thoroughly sincere and means well

I confess I cannot agree with you Prout said the Reverend John He
jumped at some silly tale of theft on their part accepted another boys
evidence without so far as I can see any inquiry andfrankly I
think he deserved all he got

They deliberately outraged Masons best feelings said Prout A word
to me on their part would have saved the whole thing But they preferred
to lure him on to play on his ignorance of their characters

That may be said King but I dont like Mason I dislike him for the
very reason that Prout advances to his credit He means well

Our criminal tradition is not theftamong ourselves at least said
little Hartopp

For the head of a house that raided seven head of cattle from the
innocent potwallopers of Northam isnt that rather a sweeping
statement said Macrea

Precisely so said Hartopp unabashed That with gatelifting and a
little poaching and hawkhunting on the cliffs is our salvation

It does us far more harm as a school Prout began

Than any hushedup scandal could Quite so Our reputation among the
farmers is most unsavory But I would much sooner deal with any amount
of ingenious crime of that nature thansome other offenses

They may be all right but they are unboylike abnormal and in
my opinion unsound Prout insisted The moral effect of their
performances must pave the way for greater harm It makes me doubtful
how to deal with them I might separate them

You might of course but they have gone up the school together for six
years _I_ shouldnt care to do it said Macrea

They use the editorial we said King irrelevantly It annoys me
Wheres your prose Corkran Well sir we havent quite done it
yet Well bring it in a minute and so on And the same with the
others

Theres great virtue in that we said little Hartopp You know I
take them for trig McTurk may have some conception of the meaning of
it but Beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines He
copies serenely from Stalky who positively rejoices in mathematics

Why dont you stop it said Prout

It rights itself at the exams Then Beetle shows up blank sheets and
trusts to his English to save him from a fall I fancy he spends most
of his time with me in writing verse

I wish to Heaven he would transfer a little of his energy in that
direction to Elegiaes King jerked himself upright He is with the
single exception of Stalky the very vilest manufacturer of barbarous
hexameters that I have ever dealt with

The work is combined in that study said the chaplain Stalky does
the mathematics McTurk the Latin and Beetle attends to their English
and French At least when he was in the sickhouse last month

Malingering Prout interjected

Quite possibly I found a very distinct falling off in their Roman
dun Jeune Homme Pauvre translations

I think it is profoundly immoral said Prout Ive always been
opposed to the study system

It would be hard to find any study where the boys dont help each
other but in Number Five the thing has probably been reduced to a
system said little Hartopp They have a system in most things

They confess as much said the Reverend John Ive seen McTurk being
hounded up the stairs to elegise the Elegy in a Churchyard while
Beetle and Stalky went to puntabout

It amounts to systematic cribbing said Prout his voice growing
deeper and deeper

No such thing little Hartopp returned You cant teach a cow the
violin

In intention it is cribbing

But we spoke under the seal of the confessional didnt we said the
Reverend John

You say youve heard them arranging their work in this way Gillett
 Prout persisted

Good Heavens Dont make me Queens evidence my dear fellow Hartopp
is equally incriminated If they ever found out that I had sneaked our
relations would sufferand I value them

I think your attitude in this matter is weak said Prout looking
round for support It would be really better to break up the studyfor
a whilewouldnt it

Oh break it up by all means said Macrea We shall see then if
Gilletts theory holds water

Be wise Prout Leave them alone or calamity will overtake you and
what is much more important they will be annoyed with me I am too fat
alas to be worried by bad boys Where are you going

Nonsense They would not darebut I am going to think this out said
Prout It needs thought In intention they cribbed and I must think
out my duty

Hes perfectly capable of putting the boys on their honor Its _I_
that am a fool The Reverend John looked round remorsefully Never
again will I forget that a master is not a man Mark my words said the
Reverend John There will be trouble


 But by the yellow Tiber
 Was tumult and affright

Out of the blue sky they were still rejoicing over the cat war Mr
Prout had dropped into Number Five read them a lecture on the enormity
of cribbing and bidden them return to the formrooms on Monday They
had raged solo and chorus all through the peaceful Sabbath for their
sin was more or less the daily practice of all the studies

Whats the good of cursing said Stalky at last Were all in the
same boat Weve got to go back and consort with the house A locker
in the formroom and a seat at prep in Number Twelve He looked
regretfully round the cozy study which McTurk their leader in matters
of Art had decorated with a dado a stencil and cretonne hangings

Yes Heffy lurchin into the formrooms like a frowzy old retriever
to see if we arent up to something You know he never leaves his house
alone these days said McTurk Oh it will be giddy

Why arent you down watchin cricket I like a robust healthy boy You
mustnt frowst in a formroom Why dont you take an interest in your
house Yah quoted Beetle

Yes why dont we Lets Well take an interest in the house Well
take no end of interest in the house He hasnt had us in the formrooms
for a year Weve learned a lot since then Oh well make it a
beautiful house before weve done Member that chap in Eric or St
WinifredsBelial somebody Im goin to be Belial said Stalky with
an ensnaring grin

Right O said Beetle and Ill be Mammon Ill lend money at
usurythats what they do at all schools accordin to the BOP Penny
a week on a shillin Thatll startle Heffys weak intellect You can be
Lucifer Turkey

What have I got to do McTurk also smiled

Head conspiraciesand cabalsand boycotts Go in for that stealthy
intrigue that Heffy is always talkin about Come on

The house received them on their fall with the mixture of jest and
sympathy always extended to boys turned out of their study The known
aloofness of the three made them more interesting

Quite like old times aint it Stalky selected a locker and flung in
his books Weve come to sport with you my young friends for a while
because our beloved housemaster has hove us out of our diggins

Serve you jolly well right said Orrin you cribbers

This will never do said Stalky We cant maintain our giddy
prestige Orrin deah if you make these remarks

They wrapped themselves lovingly about the boy thrust him to the opened
window and drew down the sash to the nape of his neck With an equal
swiftness they tied his thumbs together behind his back with a piece of
twine and then because he kicked furiously removed his shoes There
Mr Prout happened to find him a few minutes later guillotined and
helpless surrounded by a convulsed crowd who would not assist

Stalky in an upper formroom had gathered himself allies against
vengeance Orrin presently tore up at the head of a boarding party and
the formroom grew one fog of dust through which boys wrestled stamped
shouted and yelled A desk was carried away in the tumult a knot of
warriors reeled into and split a doorpanel a window was broken and
a gasjet fell Under cover of the confusion the three escaped to the
corridor whence they called in and sent up passersby to the fray

Rescue Kings Kings Kings Number Twelve formroom Rescue
ProutsProuts Rescue Macreas Rescue Hartopps

The juniors hurried out like bees aswarm asking no questions clattered
up the staircase and added themselves to the embroilment

Not bad for the first evenings work said Stalky rearranging his
collar I fancy Proutll be somewhat annoyed Wed better establish an
alibi So they sat on Mr Kings railings till prep

You see quoth Stalky as they strolled up to prep with the ignoble
herd if you get the houses well mixed up an scufflin its even
bettin that some ass will start a real row Hullo Orrin you look
rather metagrobolized

It was all your fault you beast You started it Weve got two hundred
lines apiece and Heffys lookin for you Just see what that swine
Malpas did to my eye

I like your saying we started it Who called us cribbers Cant your
infant mind connect cause and effect yet Some day youll find out that
it dont pay to jest with Number Five

Wheres that shillin you owe me said Beetle suddenly

Stalky could not see Prout behind him but returned the lead without a
quaver I only owed you ninepence you old usurer

Youve forgotten the interest said McTurk A halfpenny a week per
bob is Beetles charge You must be beastly rich Beetle

Well Beetle lent me sixpence Stalky came to a full stop and made as
to work it out on his fingers Sixpence on the nineteenth didnt he

Yes but youve forgotten you paid no interest on the other bobthe
one I lent you before

But you took my watch as security The game was developing itself
almost automatically

Never mind Pay me my interest or Ill charge you interest on
interest Remember Ive got your noteofhand shouted Beetle

You are a coldblooded Jew Stalky groaned

Hush said McTurk very loudly indeed and started as Prout came upon
them

I didnt see you in that disgraceful affair in the formroom just now
 said he

What sir Were just come up from Mr Kings said Stalky Please
sir what am I to do about prep Theyve broken the desk you told me to
sit at and the forms just swimming with ink

Find another seatfind another seat Dyou expect me to drynurse you
I wish to know whether you are in the habit of advancing money to your
associates Beetle

No sir not as a general rule sir

It is a most reprehensible habit I thought that my house at least
would be free from it Even with my opinion of you I hardly thought it
was one of your vices

Theres no harm in lending money sir is there

I am not going to bandy words with you on your notions of morality How
much have you lent Corkran

II dont quite know said Beetle It is difficult to improvise a
going concern on the spur of the minute

You seemed certain enough just now

I think its two and fourpence said McTurk with a glance of cold
scorn at Beetle In the hopelessly involved finances of the study there
was just that sum to which both McTurk and Beetle laid claim as their
share in the pledging of Stalkys secondbest Sunday trousers But
Stalky had maintained for two terms that the money was his commission
 for effecting the pawn and had of course spent it on a study brew

Understand this then You are not to continue your operations as a
moneylender Two and fourpence you said Corkran

Stalky had said nothing and continued so to do

Your influence for evil is quite strong enough without buying a hold
over your companions He felt in his pockets and oh joy produced
a florin and fourpence Bring me what you call Corkrans noteofhand
and be thankful that I do not carry the matter any further The money
is stopped from your pocketmoney Corkran The receipt to my study at
once

Little they cared Two and fourpence in a lump is worth six weekly
sixpences any hungry day of the week

But what the dooce is a noteofhand said Beetle I only read about
it in a book

Now youve jolly well got to make one said Stalky

Yesbut our ink dont turn black till next day Spose hell spot
that

Not him Hes too worried said McTurk Sign your name on a bit of
impotpaper Stalky and write I O U two and fourpence Arent
you grateful to me for getting that out of Prout Stalkyd never have
paid Why you ass

Mechanically Beetle had handed over the money to Stalky as treasurer of
the study The custom of years is not lightly broken In return for
the document Prout expounded to Beetle the enormity of moneylending
which like everything except compulsory cricket corrupted houses and
destroyed good feeling among boys made youth cold and calculating
and opened the door to all evil Finally did Beetle know of any
other cases If so it was his duty as proof of repentance to let his
housemaster know No names need be mentioned

Beetle did not knowat least he was not quite sure sir How could he
give evidence against his friends The house might of coursehere he
feigned an anguished delicacybe full of it He was not in a position
to say He had not met with any open competition in his trade but if
Mr Prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of
the house Mr Prout did consider it precisely that perhaps the
houseprefects would be better

He spun it out till halfway through prep

And said the amateur Shylock returning to the formroom and dropping
at Stalkys side if he dont think the house is putrid with it Im
several Dutchmenthats all Ive been to Mr Prouts study sir
 This to the prepmaster He said I could sit where I liked sir Oh
he is just tricklin with emotion Yes sir Im only askin Corkran
to let me have a dip in his ink

After prayers on the road to the dormitories Harrison and Craye
senior houseprefects zealous in their office waylaid them with great
anger What have you been doing to Heffy this time Beetle Hes been
jawing us all the evening

What has His Serene Transparency been vexin you for said McTurk

About Beetle lendin money to Stalky began Harrison and then Beetle
went and told him that there was any amount of moneylendin in the
house

No you dont said Beetle sitting on a bootbasket Thats just
what I didnt tell him I spoke the giddy truth He asked me if there
was much of it in the house and I said I didnt know

He thinks youre a set of filthy Shylocks said McTurk Its just as
well for you he dont think youre burglars You know he never gets a
notion out of his conscientious old head

Wellmeanin man Did it all for the best Stalky curled gracefully
round the stairrail Head in a drainpipe Full confession in the left
boot Bad for the honor of the housevery

Shut up said Harrison You chaps always behave as if you were jawin
us when we come to jaw you

Youre a lot too cheeky said Craye

I dont quite see where the cheek comes in except on your part in
interferin with a private matter between me an Beetle after it has
been settled by Prout Stalky winked cheerfully at the others

Thats the worst of clever little swots said McTurk addressing the
gas They get made prefects before they have any tact and then they
annoy chaps who could really help em to look after the honor of the
house

We wont trouble you to do that said Craye hotly

Then what are you badgerin us for said Beetle On your own showing
youve been so beastly slack looking after the house that Prout
believes its a nest of moneylenders Ive told him that Ive lent
money to Stalky and no one else I dont know whether he believes me
but that finishes my case The rest is your business

Now we find out Stalkys voice rose that there is apparently an
organized conspiracy throughout the house For aught we know the
fags may be lendin and borrowin far beyond their means We arent
responsible for it Were only the rank and file

Are you surprised we dont wish to associate with the house said
McTurk with dignity Weve kept ourselves to ourselves in our study
till we were turned out and now we find ourselves let in for for this
sort of thing Its simply disgraceful

Then you hector and bullyrag us on the stairs said Stalky about
matters that are your business entirely You know we arent prefects

You threatened us with a prefects lickin just now said Beetle
boldly inventing as he saw the bewilderment in the faces of the
enemy And if you expect youll gain anything from us by your way of
approachin us youre jolly well mistaken Thats all Goodnight

They clattered upstairs injured virtue on every inch of their backs

Butbut what the dickens have we done said Harrison amazedly to
Craye

I dont know Onlyit always happens that way when one has anything to
do with them Theyre so beastly plausible

And Mr Prout called the good boys into his study anew and succeeded
in sinking both his and their innocent minds ten fathoms deeper in
blindfolded bedazement He spoke of steps and measures of tone and
loyalty in the house and to the house and urged them to take up the
matter tactfully

So they demanded of Beetle whether he had any connection with any other
establishment Beetle promptly went to his housemaster and wished
to know by what right Harrison and Craye had reopened a matter already
settled between him and his housemaster In injured innocence no boy
excelled Beetle

Then it occurred to Prout that he might have been unfair to the culprit
who had not striven to deny or palliate his offense He sent for
Harrison and Craye reprehending them very gently for the tone they had
adopted to a repentant sinner and when they returned to their study
they used the language of despair They then made headlong inquisition
through the house driving the fags to the edge of hysterics and
unearthing with tremendous pomp and parade the natural and inevitable
system of small loans that prevails among small boys

You see Harrison Thornton minor lent me a penny last Saturday
because I was fined for breaking the window and I spent it at Keytes
I didnt know there was any harm in it And Wray major borrowed twopence
from me when my uncle sent me a postoffice orderI cashed it at
Keytesfor five bob but hell pay me back before the holidays We
didnt know there was anything wrong in it

They waded through hours of this kind of thing but found no usury
or anything approaching to Beetles gorgeous scale of interest The
seniorsfor the school had no tradition of deference to prefects
outside compulsory gamestold them succinctly to go about their
business They would not give evidence on any terms Harrison was one
idiot and Craye was another but the greatest of all they said was
their housemaster

When a house is thoroughly upset however good its conscience it breaks
into knots and coteriessmall gatherings in the twilight boxroom
committees and groups in the corridor And when from group to group
with an immense affectation of secrecy three wicked boys steal crying
_Cave_ when there is no need of caution and whispering Dont tell
 on the heels of trumpery confidences that instant invented a very fine
air of plot and intrigue can be woven round such a house

At the end of a few days it dawned on Prout that he moved in an
atmosphere of perpetual ambush Mysteries hedged him on all sides
warnings ran before his heavy feet and countersigns were muttered
behind his attentive back McTurk and Stalky invented many absurd and
idle phrasescatchwords that swept through the house as fire through
stubble It was a rare jest and the only practical outcome of the Usury
Commission that one boy should say to a friend with awful gravity
Do you think theres much of it going on in the house The other
would reply Well one cant be too careful you know The effect on
a housemaster of humane conscience and good intent may be imagined
Again a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining the esteem of
his charges does not like to hear himself described even at a distance
as Popularity Prout by a dark and scowling Celt with a fluent tongue
A rumor that storiesunusual storiesare told in the formrooms
between the lights by a boy who does not command his confidence
agitates such a man and even elaborate and tender politenessfor the
courtesy wisegrown men offer to a bewildered child was the courtesy
that Stalky wrapped round Proutrestores not his peace of mind

The tone of the house seems changedchanged for the worse said Prout
to Harrison and Craye Have you noticed it I dont for an instant
impute

He never imputed anything but on the other hand he never did anything
else and with the best intentions in the world he had reduced the
houseprefects to a state as nearly bordering on nervous irritation
as healthy boys can know Worst of all they began at times to wonder
whether Stalky  Co had not some truth in their oftenrepeated
assertions that Prout was a gloomy ass

As you know I am not the kind of man who puts himself out for every
little thing he hears I believe in letting the house work out their own
salvationwith a light guiding hand on the reins of course But there
is a perceptible lack of reverencea lower tone in matters that touch
the honor of the house a sort of hardness

 Oh Prout he is a nobleman a nobleman a nobleman
 Our Heffy is a nobleman
 He does an awful lot
 Because his popularity
 Oh popupopularity
 His giddy popularity
 Would suffer did he not

The study door stood ajar and the song borne by twenty clear voices
came faint from a formroom The fags rather liked the tune the words
were Beetles

Thats a thing no sensible man objects to said Prout with a lopsided
smile but you know straws show which way the wind blows Can you trace
it to any direct influence I am speaking to you now as heads of the
house

There isnt the least doubt of it said Harrison angrily I know
what you mean sir It all began when Number Five study came to the
formrooms Theres no use blinkin it Craye You know that too

They make things rather difficult for us sometimes said Craye Its
more their manner than anything else that Harrison means

Do they hamper you in the discharge of your duties then

Well no sir They only look on and grinand turn up their noses
generally

Ah said Prout sympathetically

I think sir said Craye plunging into the business boldly it would
be a great deal better if they were sent back to their studybetter for
the house They are rather old to be knocking about the formrooms

They are younger than Orrin or Flint and a dozen others that I can
think of

Yes sir but thats different somehow Theyre rather influential
They have a knack of upsettin things in a quiet way that one cant take
hold of At least if one does

And you think they would be better in their own study again

Emphatically Harrison and Craye were of that opinion As Harrison said
to Craye afterwards Theyve weakened our authority Theyre too big
to lick theyve made an exhibition of us over this usury business
and were a laughingstock to the rest of the school Im going up for
Sandhurst understood next term Theyve managed to knock me out of
half my work already with theirtheir lunacy If they go back to their
study we may have a little peace

Hullo Harrison McTurk ambled round the corner with a roving eye on
all possible horizons Bearin up old man Thats right Live it down
Live it down

What dyou mean

You look a little pensive said McTurk Exhaustin job superintendin
the honor of the house aint it By the way how are you off for
maresnests

Look here said Harrison hoping for instant reward Weve
recommended Prout to let you go back to your study

The dooce you have And who under the sun are _you_ to interfere
between us and our housemaster Upon my Sam you two try us very
hardyou do indeed Of course we dont know how far you abuse your
position to prejudice us with Mr Prout but when you deliberately
stop me to tell me youve been makin arrangements behind our backin
secretwith ProutII dont know really what we ought to do

Thats beastly unfair cried Craye

It is McTurk had adopted a ghastly solemnity that sat well on his
long lean face Hang it all A prefects one thing and an ushers
another but you seem to combine em You recommend thisyou recommend
that _You_ say how and when we go back to our study

Butbutwe thought youd like it Turkey We did indeed You know
youll be ever so much more comfortable there Harrisons voice was
almost tearful

McTurk turned away as though to hide his emotions

Theyre broke He hunted up Stalky and Beetle in a boxroom Theyre
sick Theyve been beggin Heffy to let us go back to Number Five Poor
devils Poor little devils

Its the olive branch was Stalkys comment Its the giddy white
flag by gum Come to think of it we _have_ metagrobolized em

Just after tea that day Mr Prout sent for them to say that if they
chose to ruin their future by neglecting their work it was entirely
their own affair He wished them however to understand that their
presence in the formrooms could not be tolerated one hour longer
He personally did not care to think of the time he must spend in
eliminating the traces of their evil influences How far Beetle had
pandered to the baser side of youthful imagination he would ascertain
later and Beetle might be sure that if Mr Prout came across any
soulcorrupting consequences

Consequences of what sir said Beetle genuinely bewildered this
time and McTurk quietly kicked him on the ankle for being fetched
 by Prout Beetle the housemaster continued knew very well what was
intended Evil and brief had been their careers under his eye and as
one standing _in loco parentis_ to their yet uncontaminated associates
he was bound to take his precautions The return of the study key closed
the sermon

But what was the basersideofimagination business said Beetle on
the stairs

I never knew such an ass as you are for justifyin yourself said
McTurk I hope I jolly well skinned your ankle Why do you let yourself
be drawn by everybody

Draws be blowed I must have tickled him up in some way I didnt know
about If Id had a notion of that before of course I could have rubbed
it in better Its too late now What a pity Baser side What _was_
he drivin at

Never mind said Stalky I knew we could make it a happy little
house I said so rememberbut I swear I didnt think wed do it so
soon


No said Prout most firmly in Commonroom I maintain that Gillett is
wrong True I let them return to their study

With your known views on cribbing too purred little Hartopp What
an immoral compromise

One moment said the Reverend John Iweall of us have exercised
an absolutely heartbreaking discretion for the last ten days Now we
want to know Confesshave you known a happy minute since

As regards my house I have not said Prout But you are entirely
wrong in your estimate of those boys In justice to the othersin
selfdefence

Ha I said it would come to that murmured the Reverend John

I was forced to send them back Their moral influence was
unspeakablesimply unspeakable

And bit by bit he told his tale beginning with Beetles usury and
ending with the houseprefects appeal

 Beetle in the _role_ of Shylock is new to me said King with
twitching lips I heard rumors of it

Before said Prout

No after you had dealt with them but I was careful not to inquire I
never interfere with

I myself said Hartopp would cheerfully give him five shillings
if he could work out one simple sum in compound interest without three
gross errors

Whywhywhy Mason the mathematical master stuttered a fierce joy
on his face youve been hadprecisely the same as me

And so you held an inquiry Little Hartopps voice drowned Masons ere
Prout caught the import of the sentence

The boy himself hinted at the existence of a deal of it in the house
 said Prout

He is past master in that line said the chaplain But as regards
the honor of the house

They lowered it in a week I have striven to build it up for years
My own houseprefectsand boys do not willingly complain of each
otherbesought me to get rid of them You say you have their
confidence Gillett they may tell you another tale As far as I am
concerned they may go to the devil in their own way Im sick and tired
of them said Prout bitterly

But it was the Reverend John with a smiling countenance who went to
the devil just after Number Five had cleared away a very pleasant little
brew it cost them two and fourpence and was settling down to prep

Come in Padre come in said Stalky thrusting forward the best
chair Weve only met you officiallike these last ten days

You were under sentence said the Reverend John I do not consort
with malefactors

Ah but were restored again said McTurk Mr Prout has relented

Without a stain on our characters said Beetle It was a painful
episode Padre most painful

Now consider for a while and perpend _mes enfants_ It is about
your characters that Ive called tonight In the language of the
schools what the dooce _have_ you been up to in Mr Prouts house It
isnt anything to laugh over He says that you so lowered the tone of
the house he had to pack you back to your studies Is that true

Every word of it Padre

Dont be flippant Turkey Listen to me Ive told you very often that
no boys in the school have a greater influence for good or evil than
you have You know I dont talk about ethics and moral codes because I
dont believe that the young of the human animal realizes what they mean
for some years to come All the same I dont want to think youve been
perverting the juniors Dont interrupt Beetle Listen to me Mr Prout
has a notion that you have been corrupting your associates somehow or
other

Mr Prout has so many notions Padre said Beetle wearily Which one
is this

Well he tells me that he heard you telling a story in the twilight in
the formroom in a whisper And Orrin said just as he opened the door
Shut up Beetle its too beastly Now then

You remember Mrs Oliphants Beleaguered City that you lent me last
term said Beetle

The Padre nodded

I got the notion out of that Only instead of a city I made it the
Coll in a fogbesieged by ghosts of dead boys who hauled chaps out of
their beds in the dormitory All the names are quite real You tell it
in a whisper you know with the names Orrin didnt like it one little
bit None of em have ever let me finish it It gets just awful at the
end part

But why in the world didnt you explain to Mr Prout instead of
leaving him under the impression

Padre Sahib said McTurk it isnt the least good explainin to Mr
Prout If he hasnt one impression hes bound to have another

Hed do it with the best o motives Hes _in loco parentis_ purred
Stalky

You young demons the Reverend John replied And am I to understand
that thethe usury business was another of your housemasters
impressions

Wellwe helped a little in that said Stalky I did owe Beetle two
and fourpence at least Beetle says I did but I never intended to pay
him Then we started a bit of an argument on the stairs andand Mr
Prout dropped into it accidental That was how it was Padre He paid me
cash down like a giddy Dook stopped it out of my pocketmoney just the
same and Beetle gave him my noteofhand all correct I dont know
what happened after that

I was too truthful said Beetle I always am You see he was under
an impression Padre and I suppose I ought to have corrected that
impression but of course I couldnt be _quite_ certain that his
house wasnt given over to moneylendin could I I thought the
houseprefects might know more about it than I did They ought to
Theyre giddy palladiums of public schools

They did tooby the time theyd finished said McTurk As nice a
pair of conscientious wellmeanin upright puresouled boys as youd
ever want to meet Padre They turned the house upside downHarrison
and Crayewith the best motives in the world

They said so They said it very loud and clear They went and shouted
in our ear said Stalky

My own private impression is that all three of you will infallibly be
hanged said the Reverend John

Why we didnt do anything McTurk replied It was all Mr Prout Did
you ever read a book about Japanese wrestlers My unclehes in the
Navygave me a beauty once

Dont try to change the subject Turkey

Im not sir Im givin an illustrationsame as a sermon These
wrestlerchaps have got sort sort of trick that lets the other chap do
all the work Than they give a little wriggle and he upsets himself
Its called _shibbuwichee_ or _tokonoma_ or somethin Mr Prouts a
_shibbuwicher_ It isnt our fault

Did you suppose we went round corruptin the minds of the fags said
Beetle They havent any to begin with and if they had theyre
corrupted long ago Ive been a fag Padre

Well I fancied I knew the normal range of your iniquities but if
you take so much trouble to pile up circumstantial evidence against
yourselves you cant blame any one if

We dont blame any one Padre We havent said a word against Mr
Prout have we Stalky looked at the others We love him He hasnt a
notion how we love him

Hm You dissemble your love very well Have you ever thought who got
you turned out of your study in the first place

It was Mr Prout turned us out said Stalky with significance

Well I was that man I didnt mean it but some words of mine Im
afraid gave Mr Prout the impression

Number Five laughed aloud

You see its just the same thing with you Padre said McTurk He
is quick to get an impression aint he But you mustnt think we dont
love him cause we do There isnt an ounce of vice about him

A double knock fell on the door

The Head to see Number Five study in his study at once said the voice
of Foxy the school sergeant

Whew said the Reverend John It seems to me that there is a great
deal of trouble coming for some people

My word Mr Prouts gone and told the Head said Stalky Hes a
moral doubleender Not fair luggin the Head into a houserow

I should recommend a copybook on ahmsafe and certain part said
the Reverend John disinterestedly

Huh He licks across the shoulders an it would slam like a beastly
barndoor said Beetle Goodnight Padre Were in for it

Once more they stood in the presence of the HeadBelial Mammon and
Lucifer But they had to deal with a man more subtle than them all Mr
Prout had talked to him heavily and sadly for half an hour and the
Head had seen all that was hidden from the housemaster

Youve been bothering Mr Prout he said pensively Housemasters
arent here to be bothered by boys more than is necessary I dont like
being bothered by these things You are bothering _me_ That is a very
serious offense You see it

Yes sir

Well now I purpose to bother you on personal and private grounds
because you have broken into my time You are much too big to lick so
I suppose I shall have to mark my displeasure in some other way Say a
thousand lines apiece a weeks gating and a few things of that kind
Much too big to lick arent you

Oh no sir said Stalky cheerfully for a weeks gating in the summer
term is serious

Very good Then we will do what we can I wish you wouldnt bother
me

It was a fair sustained equable stroke with a little draw to it
but what they felt most was his unfairness in stopping to talk between
executions Thus Among thelower classes this would lay me open to
a charge ofassault You should be more grateful for yourprivileges
than you are There is a limitone finds it by experience
Beetlebeyond which it is never safe to pursue private vendettas
becausedont movesooner or later one comesinto collision with
thehigher authority who has studied the animal _Et ego_McTurk
please_in Arcadia vixi_ Theres a certain flagrant injustice about
this that ought to appeal toyour temperament And thats all You will
tell your housemaster that you have been formally caned by me

My word said McTurk wriggling his shoulderblades all down the
corridor That was business The Prooshan Bates has an infernal
straight eye

Wasnt it wily of me to ask for the lickin said Stalky instead of
those impots

Rot We were in for it from the first I knew the look of his old eye
 said Beetle I was within an inch of blubbing

Well I didnt exactly smile Stalky confessed

Lets go down to the lavatory and have a look at the damage One of us
can hold the glass and tothers can squint

They proceeded on these lines for some ten minutes The wales were very
red and very level There was not a penny to choose between any of them
for thoroughness efficiency and a certain clarity of outline that
stamps the work of the artist

What are you doing down there Mr Prout was at the head of the
lavatory stairs attracted by the noise of splashing

Weve only been caned by the Head sir and were washing off the
blood The Head said we were to tell you We were coming to report
ourselves in a minute sir _Sotto voce_ Thats a score for Heffy

Well he deserves to score something poor devil said McTurk putting
on his shirt Weve sweated a stone and a half off him since we began

But look here why arent we wrathy with the Head He said it was a
flagrant injustice So it is said Beetle

Dear man said McTurk and vouchsafed no further answer

It was Stalky who laughed till he had to hold on by the edge of a basin

You _are_ a funny ass Whats that for said Beetle

ImIm thinking of the flagrant injustice of it




THE MORAL REFORMERS


There was no disguising the defeat The victory was to Prout but they
grudged it not If he had broken the rules of the game by calling in the
Head they had had a good run for their money

The Reverend John sought the earliest opportunity of talking things
over Members of a bachelor Commonroom of a school where masters
studies are designedly dotted among studies and formrooms can if they
choose see a great deal of their charges Number Five had spent some
cautious years in testing the Reverend John He was emphatically a
gentleman He knocked at a study door before entering he comported
himself as a visitor and not a strayed lictor he never prosed and he
never carried over into official life the confidences of idle hours
Prout was ever an unmitigated nuisance King came solely as an avenger
of blood even little Hartopp talking natural history seldom forgot
his office but the Reverend John was a guest desired and beloved by
Number Five

Behold him then in their only armchair a bent briar between his
teeth chin down in three folds on his clerical collar and blowing like
an amiable whale while Number Five discoursed of life as it appeared to
them and specially of that last interview with the Headin the matter
of usury

One licking once a week would do you an immense amount of good
 he said twinkling and shaking all over and as you say you were
entirely in the right

Raather Padre We could have proved it if hed let us talk said
Stalky but he didnt The Heads a downy bird

He understands you perfectly Ho ho Well you worked hard enough for
it

But hes awfully fair He doesnt lick a chap in the morning an preach
at him in the afternoon said Beetle

He cant he aint in Orders thank goodness said McTurk Number Five
held the very strongest views on clerical headmasters and were ever
ready to meet their pastor in argument

Almost all other schools have clerical Heads said the Reverend John
gently

It isnt fair on the chaps Stalky replied Makes em sulky Of
course its different with you sir You belong to the schoolsame as
we do I mean ordinary clergymen

Well I am a most ordinary clergyman and Mr Hartopps in Orders
too

Yees but he took em after he came to the Coll We saw him go up for
his exam Thats all right said Beetle But just think if the Head
went and got ordained

What would happen Beetle

Oh the Coll ud go to pieces in a year sir Theres no doubt o
that

How dyou know The Reverend John was smiling

Weve been here nearly six years now There are precious few things
about the Coll we dont know Stalky replied Why even you came the
term after I did sir I remember your asking our names in form your
first lesson Mr King Mr Prout and the Head of course are the only
masters senior to usin that way

Yes weve changed a good dealin Commonroom

Huh said Beetle with a grunt They came here an they went away to
get married Jolly good riddance too

Doesnt our Beetle hold with matrimony

No Padre dont make fun of me Ive met chaps in the holidays whove
got married housemasters Its perfectly awful They have babies and
teething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung _in_
the school and the masters wives give teapartiesteaparties
Padreand ask the chaps to breakfast

That dont matter so much said Stalky But the housemasters let
their houses alone and they leave everything to the prefects Why in
one school a chap told me there were big baize doors and a passage
about a mile long between the house and the masters house They could
do just what they pleased

Satan rebuking sin with a vengeance

Oh larks are right enough but you know what we mean Padre After a
bit it gets worse an worse Then theres a big bustup and a row that
gets into the papers and a lot of chaps are expelled you know

Always the wrong uns dont forget that Have a cup of cocoa Padre
 said McTurk with the kettle

No thanks Im smoking Always the wrong uns Proceed my Stalky

And thenStalky warmed to the workeverybody says Whod ha
thought it Shockin boys Wicked little kids It all comes of havin
married housemasters _I_ think

A Daniel come to judgment

But it does McTurk interrupted Ive met chaps in the holidays an
theyve told me the same thing It looks awfully pretty for ones people
to seea nice separate house with a nice lady in charge an all that
But it isnt It takes the housemasters off their work and it gives
the prefects a heap too much power ananit rots up everything You
see it isnt as if we were just an ordinary school We take crammers
rejections as well as good little boys like Stalky Weve got to do that
to make our name of course and we get em into Sandhurst somehow or
other dont we

True O Turk Like a book thou talkest Turkey

And so we want rather different masters dont you think so to other
places We arent like the rest of the schools

It leads to all sorts of bullyin too a chap told me said Beetle

Well you _do_ need most of a single mans time I must say The
Reverend John considered his hosts critically But do you never feel
that the worldthe Commonroomis too much with you sometimes

Not exactlyin summer anyhow Stalkys eye roved contentedly to the
window Our bounds are pretty big too and they leave us to ourselves
a good deal

For example here am I sitting in your study very much in your way
eh

Indeed you arent Padre Sit down Dont go sir You know were glad
whenever you come

There was no doubting the sincerity of the voices The Reverend John
flushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar

And we generally know where the Commonroom are said Beetle
triumphantly Didnt you come through our lower dormitories last night
after ten sir

I went to smoke a pipe with your housemaster No I didnt give him
any impressions I took a short cut through your dormitories

I sniffed a whiff of baccy this mornin Yours is stronger than Mr
Prouts _I_ knew said Beetle wagging his head

Good heavens said the Reverend John absently It was some years
before Beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence than
observation The long light blindless dormitories devoid of inner
doors were crossed at all hours of the night by masters visiting one
another for bachelors sit up later than married folk Beetle had never
dreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady policing

Talking about bullying the Reverend John resumed you all caught it
pretty hot when you were fags didnt you

Well we must have been rather awful little beasts said Beetle
looking serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen My Hat what
bullies they were thenFairburn Gobby Maunsell and all that gang

Member when Gobby called us the Three Blind Mice and we had to get
up on the lockers and sing while he buzzed inkpots at us said Stalky
They _were_ bullies if you like

But there isnt any of it now said McTurk soothingly

Thats where you make a mistake Were all inclined to say that
everything is all right as long we arent ourselves hurt I sometimes
wonder if it is extinctbullying

Fags bully each other horrid but the upper forms are supposed to be
swottin for exams Theyve got something else to think about said
Beetle

Why What do you think Stalky was watching the chaplains face

I have my doubts Then explosively On my word for three moderately
intelligent boys you arent very observant I suppose you were too busy
making things warm for your housemaster to see what lay under your
noses when you were in the formrooms last week

What sir II swear we didnt see anything said Beetle

Then Id advise you to look When a little chap is whimpering in a
corner and wears his clothes like rags and never does any work and
is notoriously the dirtiest little corridorcaution in the Coll
somethings wrong somewhere

Thats Clewer said McTurk under his breath

Yes Clewer He comes to me for his French Its his first term and
hes almost as complete a wreck as you were Beetle Hes not naturally
clever but he has been hammered till hes nearly an idiot

Oh no They sham silly to get off more tickings said Beetle _I_
know that

Ive never actually seen him knocked about said the Reverend John

The genuine article dont do that in public said Beetle Fairburn
never touched me when any one was looking on

You neednt swagger about it Beetle said McTurk We all caught it
in our time

But I got it worse than any one said Beetle If you want an
authority on bullyin Padre come to me Corkscrewsbrushdrill
keysheadknucklinarmtwistinrockinAg Agsand all the rest
of it

Yes I do want you as an authority or rather I want your authority to
stop itall of you

What about Abana and Pharpar PadreHarrison and Craye They are
Mr Prouts pets said McTurk a little bitterly We arent even
subprefects

Ive considered that but on the other hand since most bullying is
mere thoughtlessness

Not one little bit of it Padre said McTurk Bullies like bullyin
They mean it They think it up in lesson and practise it in the
quarters

Never mind If the thing goes up to the prefects it may make another
houserow Youve had one already Dont laugh Listen to me I ask
youmy own Tenth Legionto take the thing up quietly I want little
Clewer made to look fairly clean and decent

Blowed if _I_ wash him whispered Stalky

Decent and selfrespecting As for the other boy whoever he is
you can use your influencea purely secular light flickered in the
chaplains eyein any way you please toto dissuade him Thats all
Ill leave it to you Goodnight _mes enfants_

Well what are we goin to do Number Five stared at each other

Young Clewer would give his eyes for a place to be quiet in _I_ know
that said Beetle If we made him a studyfag eh

No said McTurk firmly Hes a dirty little brute and hed mess up
everything Besides we aint goin to have any beastly Erickin Dyou
want to walk about with your arm round his neck

Hed clean out the jampots anyhow an the burntporridge
saucepanits filthy now

Not good enough said Stalky bringing up both heels with a crash on
the table If we find the merry jester whos been bullyin him an make
him happy thatll be all right Why didnt we spot him when we were in
the formrooms though

Maybe a lot of fags have made a dead set at Clewer They do that
sometimes

Then well have to kick the whole of the lower school in our houseon
spec Come on said McTurk

Keep your hair on We mustnt make a fuss about the biznai Whoever
it is hes kept quiet or wed have seen him said Stalky Well walk
round and sniff about till were sure

They drew the house formrooms accounting for every junior and senior
against whom they had suspicions investigated at Beetles suggestion
the lavatories and boxrooms but without result Everybody seemed to be
present save Clewer

Rum said Stalky pausing outside a study door Golly

A thin piping mixed with tears came muffled through the panels

 As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping

Louder you young devil or Ill buzz a book at you

 With a pitcher of milk
 Oh Campbell _please_ dont
 To the fair of

A book crashed on something soft and squeals arose

Well I never thought it was a studychap anyhow That accounts for
our not spotting him said Beetle Sefton and Campbell are rather
hefty chaps to tackle Besides one cant go into their study like a
formroom

What swine McTurk listened Wheres the fun of it I suppose
Clewers faggin for them

They arent prefects Thats one good job said Stalky with his
wargrin Sefton and Campbell Um Campbell and Sefton Ah One of
ems a crammers pup

The two were precocious hairy youths between seventeen and eighteen
sent to the school in despair by parents who hoped that six months
steady cram might perhaps jockey them into Sandhurst Nominally they
were in Mr Prouts house actually they were under the Heads eye
and since he was very careful never to promote strange new boys to
prefectships they considered they had a grievance against the school
Sefton had spent three months with a London crammer and the tale of his
adventures there lost nothing in the telling Campbell who had a fine
taste in clothes and a fluent vocabulary followed his lead in looking
down loftily on the rest of the world This was only their second term
and the school used to what it profanely called crammers pups had
treated them with rather galling reserve But their whiskersSefton
owned a real razorand their mustaches were beyond question impressive

Shall we go in an dissuade em McTurk asked Ive never had much to
do with em but Ill bet my hat Campbells a funk

Noo Thats _oratio directa_ said Stalky shaking his head I like
_oratio obliqua_ Sides whered our moral influence be then Think o
that

Rot What are you goin to do Beetle turned into Lower Number Nine
formroom next door to the study

Me The lights of war flickered over Stalkys face Oh I want to
jape with em Shut up a bit

He drove his hands into his pockets and stared out of window at the sea
whistling between his teeth Then a foot tapped the floor one shoulder
lifted he wheeled and began the short quick doubleshufflethe
wardance of Stalky in meditation Thrice he crossed the empty
formroom with compressed lips and expanded nostrils swaying to the
quickstep Then he halted before the dumb Beetle and softly knuckled
his head Beetle bowing to the strokes McTurk nursed one knee and
rocked to and fro They could hear Clewer howling as though his heart
would break

Beetle is the sacrifice Stalky said at last Im sorry for you
Beetle Member Galtons Art of Travel one of the forms had been
studying that pleasant work an the kid whose bleatin excited the
tiger

Oh curse said Beetle uneasily It was not his first season as a
sacrifice Cant you get on without me

Fraid not Beetle dear Youve got to be bullied by Turkey an me
The more you howl o course the better itll be Turkey go an
covet a stump and a boxrope from somewhere Well tie him up for a
kill_a la_ Galton Member when Molly Fairburn made us cockfight
with our shoes off an tied up our knees

But that hurt like sin

Course it did What a clever chap you are Beetle Turkeyll knock
you all over the place Member weve had a big row all round an Ive
trapped you into doin this Lend us your wipe Beetle was trussed for
cockfighting but in addition to the transverse stump between elbow
and knee His knees were bound with a boxrope In this posture at a
push from Stalky he rolled over sideways covering himself with dust

Ruffle his hair Turkey Now you get down too The bleatin of the
kid excites the tiger You two are in such a sweatin wax with me that
you only curse Member that Ill tickle you up with a stump Youll
have to blub Beetle

Right O Ill work up to it in half a shake said Beetle

Now beginand remember the bleatin o the kid

Shut up you brutes Let me up Youve nearly cut my knees off Oh you
_are_ beastly cads _Do_ shut up Tisnt a joke Beetles protest was
in tone a work of art

Give it to him Turkey Kick him Roll him over Kill him Dont funk
Beetle you brute Kick him again Turkey

Hes not blubbin really Roll up Beetle or Ill kick you into the
fender roared McTurk They made a hideous noise among them and the
bait allured their quarry

Hullo Whats the giddy jest Sefton and Campbell entered to find
Beetle on his side his head against the fender weeping copiously
while McTurk prodded him in the back with his toes

Its only Beetle Stalky explained Hes shammin hurt I cant get
Turkey to go for him properly Sefton promptly kicked both boys and
his face lighted All right Ill attend to em Get up an cockfight
you two Give me the stump Ill tickle em Heres a giddy jest Come
on Campbell Lets cook em

Then McTurk turned on Stalky and called him very evil names

You said you were goin to cockfight too Stalky Come on

More ass you for believin me then shrieked Stalky

Have you chaps had a row said Campbell Row said Stalky Huh Im
only educatin them Dyou know anythin about cockfighting Seffy

Do I know Why at Maclagans where I was crammin in town we used
to cockfight in his drawingroom and little Maclagan darent say
anything But we were just the same as men there of course Do I know
_I_ll show you

Cant I get up moaned Beetle as Stalky sat on his shoulder

Dont jaw you fat piffler Youre going to fight Seffy

Hell slay me

Oh lug em into our study said Campbell Its nice an quiet in
there Ill cockfight Turkey This is an improvement on young Clewer

Right O I move its shoesoff for them an shoeson for us said
Sefton joyously and the two were flung down on the study floor Stalky
rolled them behind an armchair Now Ill tie you two up an direct the
bullfight Golly what wrists you have Seffy Theyre too thick for a
wipe got a boxrope said he

Lots in the corner Sefton replied Hurry up Stop blubbin you
brute Beetle Were goin to have a giddy campaign Losers have to sing
for the winnerssing odes in honor of the conqueror You call yourself
a beastly poet dont you Beetle Ill poet you

He wriggled into position by Campbells side Swiftly and scientifically
the stumps were thrust through the natural crooks and the wrists
tied with wellstretched boxropes to an accompaniment of insults from
McTurk bound betrayed and voluble behind the chair Stalky set away
Campbell and Sefton and strode over to his allies locking the door on
the way

And thats all right said he in a changed voice

What the devil Sefton began Beetles false tears had ceased
McTurk smiling was on his feet Together they bound the knees and
ankles of the enemy even more straitly

Stalky took the armchair and contemplated the scene with his blandest
smile A man trussed for cockfighting is perhaps the most helpless
thing in the world

The bleatin of the kid excites the tiger Oh you frabjous asses
 He lay back and laughed till he could no more The victims took in the
situation but slowly Well give you the finest lickin you ever had
in your young lives when we get up thundered Sefton from the floor
Youll laugh the other side of your mouth before youve done What the
deuce dyou mean by this

Youll see in two shakes said McTurk Dont swear like that What we
want to know is why you two hulkin swine have been bullyin Clewer

Its none of your business

What did you bully Clewer for The question was repeated with
maddening iteration by each in turn They knew their work

Because we jolly well chose was the answer at last Lets get up
 Even then they could not realize the game

Well now were goin to bully you because we jolly well choose Were
goin to be just as fair to you as you were to Clewer He couldnt do
anything against you You cant do anything to us Odd aint it

Cant we You wait an see

Ah said Beetle reflectively that shows youve never been properly
jested with A public lickin aint in it with a gentle jape Bet a bob
youll weep an promise anything

Look here young Beetle well half kill you when we get up Ill
promise you that at any rate

Youre going to be half killed first though Did you give Clewer
Headknuckles

Did you give Clewer Headknuckles McTurk echoed At the twentieth
repetitionno boy can stand the torture of one unvarying query which
is the essence of bullyingcame confession

We did confound you

Then youll be knuckled and knuckled they were according to ancient
experience Headknuckling is no trifle Molly Fairburn of the old
days could not have done better

Did you give Clewer Brushdrill This time the question was answered
sooner and Brushdrill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by
Stalkys watch They could not even writhe in their bonds No brush is
employed in Brushdrill

Did you give Clewer the Key

No we didnt I swear we didnt from Campbell rolling in agony

Then well give it to you so you can see what it would be like if you
had

The torture of the Keywhich has no key at allhurts excessively They
endured several minutes of it and their language necessitated the gag

Did you give Clewer Corkscrews

Yes Oh curse your silly souls Let us alone you cads

They were corkscrewed and the torture of the Corkscrewthis has
nothing to do with corkscrewsis keener than the torture of the Key

The method and silence of the attacks was breaking their nerves Between
each new torture came the pitiless dazing rain of questions and when
they did not answer to the point Isabellacolored handkerchiefs were
thrust into their mouths

Now are those all the things you did to Clewer Take out the gag
Turkey and let em answer

Yes I swear that was all Oh youre killing us Stalky cried
Campbell

Precisely what Clewer said to you I heard him Now were goin to
show you what real bullyin is What I dont like about you Sefton
is you come to the Coll with your stickup collars an patentleather
boots an you think you can teach us something about bullying Do you
think you can teach us anything about bullying Take out the gag and let
him answer

Noferociously

He says no Rock him to sleep Campbell can watch

It needs three boys and two boxinggloves to rock a boy to sleep Again
the operation has nothing to do with its name Sefton was rocked till
his eyes set in his head and he gasped and crowed for breath sick and
dizzy

My Aunt said Campbell appalled from his corner and turned white

Put him away said Stalky Bring on Campbell Now this _is_ bullyin
Oh I forgot I say Campbell what did you bully Clewer for Take out
his gag and let him answer

II dont know Oh let me off I swear Ill make it _pax_ Dont
rock me

The bleatin of the kid excites the tiger He says he dont know Set
him up Beetle Give me the glove an put in the gag

In silence Campbell was rocked sixtyfour times

I believe Im goin to die he gasped He says he is goin to die
Put him away Now Sefton Oh I forgot Sefton what did you bully
Clewer for

The answer is unprintable but it brought not the faintest flush to
Stalkys downy cheek

Make him an Ag Ag Turkey

And an Ag Ag was he made forthwith The hardbought experience of
nearly eighteen years was at his disposal but he did not seem to
appreciate it

He says we are sweeps Put him away Now Campbell Oh I forgot I
say Campbell what did you bully Clewer for

Then came the tearsscalding tears appeals for mercy and abject
promises of peace Let them cease the tortures and Campbell would never
lift hand against them The questions began againto an accompaniment
of small persuasions

You seem hurt Campbell Are you hurt

Yes Awfully

He says he is hurt Are you broke

Yes yes I swear I am Oh stop

He says he is broke Are you humble

Yes

He says he is humble Are you devilish humble

Yes

He says he is devilish humble Will you bully Clewer any more

No Noooh

He says he wont bully Clewer Or any one else

No I swear I wont

Or any one else What about that lickin you and Sefton were goin to
give us

I wont I wont I swear I wont

He says he wont lick us Do you esteem yourself to know anything about
bullyin

No I dont

He says he doesnt know anything about bullyin Havent we taught you
a lot

Yesyes

He says weve taught him a lot Arent you grateful

Yes

He says he is grateful Put him away Oh I forgot I say Campbell
what did you bully Clewer for

He wept anew his nerves being raw Because I was a bully I suppose
thats what you want me to say

He says he is a bully Right he is Put him in the corner No more
japes for Campbell Now Sefton

You devils You young devils This and much more as Sefton was punted
across the carpet by skilful knees

The bleatin of the kid excites the tiger Were goin to make you
beautiful Where does he keep his shaving things Campbell told
Beetle get some water Turkey make the lather Were goin to shave
you Seffy so youd better lie jolly still or youll get cut Ive
never shaved any one before

Dont Oh dont Please dont

Gettin polite eh Im only goin to take off one ducky little
whisker

IllIll make it _pax_ if you dont I swear Ill let you off your
lickin when I get up

_And_ half that mustache were so proud of He says hell let us off
our lickin Isnt he kind

McTurk laughed into the nickelplated shavingcup and settled Seftons
head between Stalkys viselike knees

Hold on a shake said Beetle you cant shave long hairs Youve got
to cut all that mustache short first an then scrape him

Well Im not goin to hunt about for scissors Wont a match do Chuck
us the matchbox He _is_ a hog you know we might as well singe him
Lie still He lit a vesta but checked his hand I only want to take
off half though

Thats all right Beetle waved the brush Ill lather up to the
middlesee and you can burn off the rest

The thinhaired first mustache of youth fluffed off in flame to the
latherline in the centre of the lip and Stalky rubbed away the
burnt stumpage with his thumb It was not a very gentle shave but it
abundantly accomplished its purpose

Now the whisker on the other side Turn him over Between match and
razor this too was removed Give him his shavingglass Take the gag
out I want to hear what hell say

But there were no words Sefton gazed at the lopsided wreck in horror
and despair Two fat tears rolled down his cheek

Oh I forgot I say Sefton what did you bully Clewer for

Leave me alone Oh you infernal bullies leave me alone Havent I had
enough

He says we must leave him alone said McTurk

He says we are bullies an we havent even begun yet said Beetle
Youre ungrateful Seffy Golly You do look an atrocity and a half

He says he has had enough said Stalky He errs

Well to work to work chanted McTurk waving a stump Come on my
giddy Narcissus Dont fall in love with your own reflection

Oh let him off said Campbell from his corner hes blubbing too

Sefton cried like a twelveyearold with pain shame wounded vanity
and utter helplessness

Youll make it _pax_ Sefton wont you You cant stand up to those
young devils

Dont be rude Campbell deah said McTurk or youll catch it
again

You _are_ devils you know said Campbell

What for a little bullyinsame as youve been givin Clewer How
long have you been jestin with him said Stalky All this term

We didnt always knock him about though

You did when you could catch him said Beetle crosslegged on the
floor dropping a stump from time to time across Seftons instep Dont
I know it

Iperhaps we did

And you went out of your way to catch him Dont I know it Because he
was an awful little beast eh Dont I know it Now you see _you_re
awful beasts and youre gettin what he gotfor bein a beast Just
because we choose

We never really bullied himlike youve done us

Yah said Beetle They never really bullyMolly Fairburn didnt
Only knock em about a little bit Thats what they say Only kick their
souls out of em and they go and blub in the boxrooms Shove their
heads into the ulsters an blub Write home three times a dayyes
you brute Ive done thataskin to be taken away Youve never been
bullied properly Campbell Im sorry you made _pax_

Im not said Campbell who was a humorist in a way Look out youre
slaying Sefton

In his excitement Beetle had used the stump unreflectingly and Sefton
was now shouting for mercy

An you he cried wheeling where he sat Youve never been bullied
either Where were you before you came here

II had a tutor

Yah You would You never blubbed in your life But youre blubbin
now by gum Arent you blubbin

Cant you see you blind beast Sefton fell over sideways teartracks
furrowing the dried lather Crack came the cricketstump on the curved
latterend of him

Blind am I said Beetle and a beast Shut up Stalky Im goin to
jape a bit with our friend _a la_ Molly Fairburn _I_ think I can
see Cant I see Sefton

The point is well taken said McTurk watching the strap at work
Youd better say that he sees Seffy

You doyou can I swear you do yelled Sefton for strong arguments
were coercing him

Arent my eyes lovely The stump rose and fell steadily throughout
this catechism

Yes

A gentle hazel arent they

Yesoh yes

What a liar you are Theyre skyblue Aint they skyblue

Yesoh yes

You dont know your mind from one minute to another You must
learnyou must learn

What a bait youre in said Stalky Keep your hair on Beetle

Ive had it done to me said Beetle Nowabout my being a beast

_Pax_oh _pax_ cried Sefton make it _pax_ Ill give up Let me
off Im broke I cant stand it

Ugh Just when we were gettin our hand in grunted McTurk

They didnt let Clewer off Ill swear

Confessapologizequick said Stalky

From the floor Sefton made unconditional surrender more abjectly even
than Campbell He would never touch any one again He would go softly all
the days of his life

Weve got to take it I suppose said Stalky All right Sefton
Youre broke Very good Shut up Beetle But before we let you up you
an Campbell will kindly oblige us with Kitty of Coleraine_a la_
Clewer

Thats not fair said Campbell weve surrendered

Course you have Now youre goin to do what we tell yousame as
Clewer would If you hadnt surrendered youd ha been really bullied
Havin surrendereddo you follow Seffyyou sing odes in honor of the
conquerors Hurry up

They dropped into chairs luxuriously Campbell and Sefton looked at each
other and neither taking comfort from that view struck up Kitty of
Coleraine

Vile bad said Stalky as the miserable wailing ended If you hadnt
surrendered it would have been our painful duty to buzz books at you for
singin out o tune Now then

He freed them from their bonds but for several minutes they could not
rise Campbell was first on his feet smiling uneasily Sefton staggered
to the table buried his head in his arms and shook with sobs There
was no shadow of fight in eitheronly amazement distress and shame

Cacant he shave clean before tea please said Campbell Its ten
minutes to bell

Stalky shook his head He meant to escort the halfshaved one to the
meal

McTurk yawned in his chair and Beetle mopped his face They were all
dripping with excitement and exertion

If I knew anything about it I swear Id give you a moral lecture
 said Stalky severely

Dont jaw theyve surrendered said McTurk This moral suasion
biznai takes it out of a chap

Dont you see how gentle weve been We might have called Clewer in to
look at you said Stalky The bleatin of the tiger excites the kid
But we didnt Weve only got to tell a few chaps in Coll about this
and youd be hooted all over the shop Your life wouldnt be worth
havin But we arent goin to do that either Were strictly moral
suasers Campbell so unless you or Seffy split about this no one
will

I swear youre a brick said Campbell I suppose I was rather a brute
to Clewer

It looked like it said Stalky But I dont think Seffy need come
into hall with cockeye whiskers Horrid bad for the fags if they saw
him He can shave Aint you grateful Sefton

The head did not lift Sefton was deeply asleep

Thats rummy said McTurk as a snore mixed with a sob Cheek _I_
think or else hes shammin

No tisnt said Beetle When Molly Fairburn had attended to me
for an hour or so I used to go bung off to sleep on a form sometimes
Poor devil But he called me a beastly poet though

Well come on Stalky lowered his voice Goodby Campbell Member
if you dont talk nobody will

There should have been a wardance but that all three were so utterly
tired that they almost went to sleep above the teacups in their study
and slept till prep


A most extraordinary letter Are all parents incurably mad What do you
make of it said the Head handing a closely written eight pages to the
Reverend John

The only son of his mother and she a widow That is the least
reasonable sort The chaplain read with pursed lips If half
those charges are true he should be in the sickhouse whereas he is
disgustingly well Certainly he has shaved I noticed that

Under compulsion as his mother points out How delicious How
salutary

You havent to answer her It isnt often I dont know what has
happened in the school but this is beyond me

If you asked me I should say seek not to propitiate When one is forced
to take crammers pups

He was perfectly well at extratuitionwith methis morning said
the Head absently Unusually well behaved too

they either educate the school or the school as in this case
educates them I prefer our own methods the chaplain concluded

You think it was that A lift of the Heads eyebrow

Im sure of it And nothing excuses his trying to give the College a
bad name

Thats the line I mean to take with him the Head answered

The Augurs winked


A few days later the Reverend John called on Number Five Why havent
we seen you before Padre said they

Ive been watching times and seasons and events and menand boys he
replied I am pleased with my Tenth Legion I make them my compliments
Clewer was throwing inkballs in form this morning instead of doing his
work He is now doing fifty lines forunheardof audacity

You cant blame us sir said Beetle You told us to remove
theerpressure Thats the worst of a fag

Ive known boys five years his senior throw inkballs Beetle To such
an one have I given two hundred linesnot so long ago And now I come
to think of it were those lines ever shown up

Were they Turkey said Beetle unblushingly

Dont you think Clewer looks a little cleaner Padre Stalky
interrupted

Were no end of moral reformers said McTurk

It was all Stalky but it was a lark said Beetle

I have noticed the moral reform in several quarters Didnt I tell you
you had more influence than any boys in the Coll if you cared to use
it

Its a trifle exhaustin to use frequentour kind of moral suasion
Besides you see it only makes Clewer cheeky

I wasnt thinking of Clewer I was thinking ofthe other people
Stalky

Oh we didnt bother much about the other people said McTurk Did
we

But _I_ didfrom the beginning

Then you knew sir

A downward puff of smoke Boys educate each other they say more than
we can or dare If I had used one half of the moral suasion you may or
may not have employed

With the best motives in the world Dont forget our pious motives
Padre said McTurk

I suppose I should be now languishing in Bideford jail shouldnt I
Well to quote the Head in a little business which we have agreed to
forget that strikes me as flagrant injustice What are you laughing
at you young sinners Isnt it true I will not stay to be shouted at
What I looked into this den of iniquity for was to find out if any one
cared to come down for a bathe off the Ridge But I see you wont

Wont we though Half a shake Padre Sahib till we get our towels
and _nous sommes avec vous_




A LITTLE PREP


Easter term was but a month old when Stettson major a dayboy
contracted diphtheria and the Head was very angry He decreed a new and
narrower set of boundsthe infection had been traced to an outlying
farmhouseurged the prefects severely to lick all trespassers and
promised extra attentions from his own hand There were no words bad
enough for Stettson major quarantined at his mothers house who had
lowered the schoolaverage of health This he said in the gymnasium
after prayers Then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious
parents and guardians and bade the school carry on The trouble did not
spread but one night a dogcart drove to the Heads door and in the
morning the Head had gone leaving all things in charge of Mr King
senior housemaster The Head often ran up to town where the school
devoutly believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the Army
Examination papers but this absence was unusually prolonged

Downy old bird said Stalky to the allies one wet afternoon in the
study He must have gone on a bend and been locked up under a false
name

What for Beetle entered joyously into the libel

Forty shillins or a month for hackin the chuckerout of the Pavvy on
the shins Bates always has a spree when he goes to town Wish he
was back though Im about sick o Kings whips an scorpions an
lectures on publicschool spirityahand scholarship

Crass an materialized brutality of the middleclassesreadin solely
for marks Not a scholar in the whole school McTurk quoted pensively
boring holes in the mantelpiece with a hot poker

Thats rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon Stinks too
Lets come out an smoke Heres a treat Stalky held up a long Indian
cheroot Bagged it from my pater last holidays Im a bit shy of it
though its heftier than a pipe Well smoke it palaverfashion Hand
it round eh Lets lie up behind the old harrow on the Monkeyfarm
Road

Out of bounds Bounds beastly strict these days too Besides we shall
cat Beetle sniffed the cheroot critically Its a regular Pomposo
Stinkadore

You can I shant What dyou say Turkey

Oh mays well I spose

Chuck on your cap then Its two to one Beetle out you come

They saw a group of boys by the noticeboard in the corridor little
Foxy the school sergeant among them

More bounds I expect said Stalky Hullo Foxibus who are you in
mournin for There was a broad band of crape round Foxys arm

He was in my old regiment said Foxy jerking his head towards the
notices where a newspaper cutting was thumbtacked between callover
lists

By gum quoth Stalky uncovering as he read Its old
DuncanFatSow Duncankilled on duty at something or other Kotal
_Rallyin his men with conspicuous gallantry_ He would of course
_The body was recovered_ Thats all right They cut em up sometimes
dont they Foxy

Horrid said the sergeant briefly

Poor old FatSow I was a fag when he left How many does that make to
us Foxy

Mr Duncan he is the ninth He come here when he was no bigger
than little Grey tertius My old regiment too Yiss nine to us Mr
Corkran up to date

The boys went out into the wet walking swiftly

Wonder how it feelsto be shot and all that said Stalky as they
splashed down a lane Where did it happen Beetle

Oh out in India somewhere Were always rowin there But look here
Stalky what _is_ the good o sittin under a hedge an cattin Its
beeastly cold Its beeastly wet and well be collared as sure as a
gun

Shut up Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky get you into a mess yet
 Like many other leaders Stalky did not dwell on past defeats They
pushed through a dripping hedge landed among waterlogged clods and
sat down on a rustcoated harrow The cheroot burned with sputterings
of saltpetre They smoked it gingerly each passing to the other between
closed forefinger and thumb

Good job we hadnt one apiece aint it said Stalky shivering
through set teeth To prove his words he immediately laid all before
them and they followed his example

I told you moaned Beetle sweating clammy drops Oh Stalky you are
a fool

_Je cat_ _tu cat_ _il cat_ _Nous cattons_ McTurk handed up his
contribution and lay hopelessly on the cold iron

Somethings wrong with the beastly thing I say Beetle have you been
droppin ink on it

But Beetle was in no case to answer Limp and empty they sprawled
across the harrow the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the
abandoned cherootend reeking under their very cold noses Thenthey
had heard nothingthe Head himself stood before themthe Head who
should have been in town bribing examinersthe Head fantastically
attired in old tweeds and a deerstalker

Ah he said fingering his mustache Very good I might have guessed
who it was You will go back to the College and give my compliments to
Mr King and ask him to give you an extraspecial licking You will then
do me five hundred lines I shall be back tomorrow Five hundred lines
by five oclock tomorrow You are also gated for a week This is not
exactly the time for breaking bounds Extraspecial please

He disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come There was a
murmur of womens voices in the deep lane

Oh you Prooshan brute said McTurk as the voices died away Stalky
its all your silly fault

Kill him Kill him gasped Beetle

I caant Im going to cat again I dont mind that but Kingll
gloat over us horrid Extraspecial ooh

Stalky made no answernot even a soft one They went to College and
received that for which they had been sent King enjoyed himself most
thoroughly for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt from
his hand save under special order Luckily he was no expert in the
gentle art

Strange how desire doth outrun performance said Beetle
irreverently quoting from some Shakespeare play that they were cramming
that term They regained their study and settled down to the imposition

Youre quite right Beetle Stalky spoke in silky and propitiating
tones Now if the Head had sent us up to a prefect wed have got
something to remember

Look here McTurk began with cold venom we arent goin to row you
about this business because its too bad for a row but we want you
to understand youre jolly well excommunicated Stalky Youre a plain
ass

How was I to know that the Head ud collar us What was he doin in
those ghastly clothes too

Dont try to raise a sideissue Beetle grunted severely

Well it was all Stettson majors fault If he hadnt gone an got
diphtheria twouldnt have happened But dont you think it rather
rummythe Head droppin on us that way

Shut up Youre dead said Beetle Weve chopped your spurs off your
beastly heels Weve cocked your shield upside down andand I dont
think you ought to be allowed to brew for a month

Oh stop jawin at me I want

Stop Whywhy were gated for a week McTurk almost howled as the
agony of the situation overcame him A lickin from King five hundred
lines _and_ a gatin Dyou expect us to kiss you Stalky you beast

Drop rottin for a minute I want to find out about the Head bein
where he was

Well you have You found him quite well and fit Found him makin love
to Stettson majors mother That was her in the laneI heard her And
so we were ordered a lickin before a dayboys mother Bony old widow
too said McTurk Anything else youd like to find out

I dont care I swear Ill get even with him some day Stalky growled

Looks like it said McTurk Extraspecial weeks gatin and five
hundred and now youre goin to row about it Help scrag him
Beetle Stalky had thrown his Virgil at them

The Head returned next day without explanation to find the lines
waiting for him and the school a little relaxed under Mr Kings
viceroyalty Mr King had been talking at and round and over the boys
heads in a lofty and promiscuous style of publicschool spirit and the
traditions of ancient seats for he always improved an occasion Beyond
waking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all
other foundations he accomplished littleso little indeed that when
two days after the Heads return he chanced to come across Stalky 
Co gated but ever resourceful playing marbles in the corridor he
said that he was not surprisednot in the least surprised This was
what he had expected from persons of their _morale_

But there isnt any rule against marbles sir Very interestin game
 said Beetle his knees white with chalk and dust Then he received
two hundred lines for insolence besides an order to go to the nearest
prefect for judgment and slaughter

This is what happened behind the closed doors of Flints study and
Flint was then Head of the Games

Oh I say Flint King has sent me to you for playin marbles in the
corridor an shoutin alley tor an knuckle down

What does he suppose I have to do with that was the answer

Dunno Well Beetle grinned wickedly What am I to tell him Hes
rather wrathy about it

If the Head chooses to put a notice in the corridor forbiddin marbles
I can do something but I cant move on a housemasters report He
knows that as well as I do

The sense of this oracle Beetle conveyed all unsweetened to King who
hastened to interview Flint

Now Flint had been seven and a half years at the College counting six
months with a London crammer from whose roof he had returned homesick
to the Head for the final Army polish There were four or five other
seniors who had gone through much the same mill not to mention
boys rejected by other establishments on account of a certain
overwhelmingness whom the Head had wrought into very fair shape It was
not a Sixth to be handled without gloves as King found

Am I to understand it is your intention to allow boardschool games
under your study windows Flint If so I can only say He said much
and Flint listened politely

Well sir if the Head sees fit to call a prefects meeting we are
bound to take the matter up But the tradition of the school is that the
prefects cant move in any matter affecting the whole school without the
Heads direct order

Much more was then delivered both sides a little losing their temper

After tea at an informal gathering of prefects in his study Flint
related the adventure

Hes been playin for this for a week and now hes got it You know as
well as I do that if he hadnt been gassing at us the way he has that
young devil Beetle wouldnt have dreamed of marbles

We know that said Perowne but that isnt the question On
Flints showin King has called the prefects names enough to justify
a firstclass row Crammers rejections illregulated hobbledehoys
wasnt it Now its impossible for prefects

Rot said Flint Kings the best classical cram weve got and
tisnt fair to bother the Head with a row Hes up to his eyes with
extratu and Army work as it is Besides as I told King we _arent_ a
public school Were a limited liability company payin four per cent
My fathers a shareholder too

Whats that got to do with it said Venner a redheaded boy of
nineteen

Well seems to me that we should be interferin with ourselves Weve
got to get into the Army orget out havent we Kings hired by the
Council to teach us All the rests gumdiddle Cant you see

It might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that
the Head took his afterdinner cheroot to Flints study but he so
often began an evening in a prefects room that nobody suspected when he
drifted in pensively after the knocks that etiquette demanded

Prefects meeting A cock of one wise eyebrow

Not exactly sir were just talking things over Wont you take the
easy chair

Thanks Luxurious infants you are He dropped into Flints big
halfcouch and puffed for a while in silence Well since youre all
here I may confess that Im the mute with the bowstring

The young faces grew serious The phrase meant that certain of their
number would be withdrawn from all further games for extratuition It
might also mean future success at Sandhurst but it was present ruin for
the First Fifteen

Yes Ive come for my pound of flesh I ought to have had you out
before the Exeter match but its our sacred duty to beat Exeter

Isnt the Old Boys match sacred too sir said Perowne The Old
Boys match was the event of the Easter term

Well hope they arent in training Now for the list First I want
Flint Its the Euclid that does it You must work deductions with me
Perowne extra mechanical drawing Dawson goes to Mr King for extra
Latin and Venner to me for German Have I damaged the First Fifteen
much He smiled sweetly

Ruined it Im afraid sir said Flint Cant you let us off till the
end of the term

Impossible It will be a tight squeeze for Sandhurst this year

And all to be cut up by those vile Afghans too said Dawson
Wouldnt think thered be so much competition would you

Oh that reminds me Crandall is coming down with the Old BoysIve
asked twenty of them but we shant get more than a weak team I dont
know whether hell be much use though He was rather knocked about
recovering poor old Duncans body

Crandall majorthe Gunner Perowne asked

No the minorToffee Crandallin a native infantry regiment He was
almost before your time Perowne

The papers didnt say anything about him We read about FatSow of
course Whats Crandall done sir

Ive brought over an Indian paper that his mother sent me It was
rather ahefty I think you saypiece of work Shall I read it The
Head knew how to read When he had finished the quartercolumn of close
type everybody thanked him politely

Good for the old Coll said Perowne Pity he wasnt in time to save
FatSow though Thats nine to us isnt it in the last three years

Yes And I took old Duncan off all games for extratu five years ago
this term said the Head By the way who do you hand over the Games
to Flint

Havent thought yet Whod you recommend sir

No thank you Ive heard it casually hinted behind my back that the
Prooshan Bates is a downy bird but he isnt going to make himself
responsible for a new Head of the Games Settle it among yourselves
Goodnight

And thats the man said Flint when the door shut that you want to
bother with a dames school row

I was only pullin your fat leg Perowne returned hastily Youre so
easy to draw Flint

Well never mind that The Heads knocked the First Fifteen to bits
and weve got to pick up the pieces or the Old Boys will have a
walkover Lets promote all the Second Fifteen and make Big Side play
up Theres heaps of talent somewhere that we can polish up between now
and the match

The case was represented so urgently to the school that even Stalky
and McTurk who affected to despise football played one BigSide game
seriously They were forthwith promoted ere their ardor had time to
cool and the dignity of their Caps demanded that they should keep some
show of virtue The matchteam was worked at least four days out of
seven and the school saw hope ahead

With the last week of the term the Old Boys began to arrive and their
welcome was nicely proportioned to their worth Gentlemen cadets from
Sandhurst and Woolwich who had only left a year ago but who carried
enormous side were greeted with a cheerful Hullo Whats the Shop
like from those who had shared their studies Militia subalterns had
more consideration but it was understood they were not precisely of the
true metal Recreants who failing for the Army had gone into business
or banks were received for old sakes sake but in no way made too much
of But when the real subalterns officers and gentlemen fullblownwho
had been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no
sidecame on the scene strolling about with the Head the school
divided right and left in admiring silence And when one laid hands on
Flint even upon the Head of the Games crying Good Heavens What do
you mean by growing in this way You were a beastly little fag when I
left visible haloes encircled Flint They would walk to and fro in
the corridor with the little red schoolsergeant telling news of old
regiments they would burst into formrooms sniffing the wellremembered
smells of ink and whitewash they would find nephews and cousins in the
lower forms and present them with enormous wealth or they would invade
the gymnasium and make Foxy show off the new stock on the bars

Chiefly though they talked with the Head who was fatherconfessor
and agentgeneral to them all for what they shouted in their unthinking
youth they proved in their thoughtless manhoodto wit that the
Prooshan Bates was a downy bird Young blood who had stumbled into an
entanglement with a pastrycooks daughter at Plymouth experience who
had come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers ambition halting
at crossroads anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest
extravagance pursued by the moneylender arrogance in the thick of a
regimental roweach carried his trouble to the Head and Chiron showed
him in language quite unfit for little boys a quiet and safe way
round out or under So they overflowed his house smoked his cigars
and drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or
three of the old school had foregathered

Dont stop smoking for a minute said the Head The more youre out
of training the better for us Ive demoralized the First Fifteen with
extratu

Ah but were a scratch lot Have you told em we shall need a
substitute even if Crandall can play said a Lieutenant of Engineers
with a DSO to his credit

He wrote me hed play so he cant have been much hurt Hes coming
down tomorrow morning

Crandall minor that was and brought off poor Duncans body The Head
nodded Where are you going to put him Weve turned you out of house
and home already Head Sahib This was a Squadron Commander of Bengal
Lancers home on leave

Im afraid hell have to go up to his old dormitory You know old boys
can claim that privilege Yes I think little Crandall minor must bed
down there once more

Bates Sahib a Gunner flung a heavy arm round the Heads
neckyouve got something up your sleeve Confess I know that
twinkle

Cant you see you cuckoo a Submarine Miner interrupted Crandall
goes up to the dormitory as an objectlesson for moral effect and so
forth Isnt that true Head Sahib

It is You know too much Purvis I licked you for that in 79

You did sir and its my private belief you chalked the cane

Nno But Ive a very straight eye Perhaps that misled you

That opened the floodgates of fresh memories and they all told tales
out of school

When Crandall minor that wasLieutenant R Crandall of an ordinary
Indian regimentarrived from Exeter on the morning of the match he
was cheered along the whole front of the College for the prefects
had repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in Flints
study When Prouts house understood that he would claim his Old Boys
right to a bed for one night Beetle ran into Kings house next door
and executed a public gloat up and down the enemys big formroom
departing in a haze of inkpots

What dyou take any notice of those rotters for said Stalky
playing substitute for the Old Boys magnificent in black jersey white
knickers and black stockings I talked to _him_ up in the dormitory
when he was changin Pulled his sweater down for him Hes cut about
all over the armshorrid purply ones Hes goin to tell us about it
tonight I asked him to when I was lacin his boots

Well you _have_ got cheek said Beetle enviously

Slipped out before I thought But he wasnt a bit angry Hes no end of
a chap I swear Im goin to play up like beans Tell Turkey

The technique of that match belongs to a bygone age Scrimmages were
tight and enduring hacking was direct and to the purpose and around
the scrimmage stood the school crying Put down your heads and shove
 Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency and mothers of
dayboys too close to the touchline heard language not included in the
bills No one was actually carried off the field but both sides felt
happier when time was called and Beetle helped Stalky and McTurk into
their overcoats The two had met in the manylegged heart of things
and as Stalky said had done each other proud As they swaggered
woodenly behind the teamssubstitutes do not rank as equals of hairy
menthey passed a ponycarriage near the wall and a husky voice cried
Well played Oh played indeed It was Stettson major whitechecked
and holloweyed who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an
impatient coachman

Hullo Stettson said Stalky checking Is it safe to come near you
yet

Oh yes Im all right They wouldnt let me out before but I had to
come to the match Your mouth looks pretty plummy

Turkey trod on it accidentaldoneapurpose Well Im glad youre
better because we owe you something You and your membranes got us into
a sweet mess young man

I heard of that said the boy giggling The Head told me

Dooce he did When

Oh come on up to Coll My shinll stiffen if we stay jawin here

Shut up Turkey I want to find out about this Well

He was stayin at our house all the time I was ill

What for Neglectin the Coll that way Thought he was in town

I was off my head you know and they said I kept on callin for him

Cheek Youre only a dayboy

He came just the same and he about saved my life I was all bunged up
one nightjust goin to croak the doctor saidand they stuck a tube
or somethin in my throat and the Head sucked out the stuff

Ugh Shot if _I_ would

He ought to have got diphtheria himself the doctor said So he stayed
on at our house instead of going back Id ha croaked in another twenty
minutes the doctor says

Here the coachman being under orders whipped up and nearly ran over
the three

My Hat said Beetle Thats pretty average heroic

Pretty average McTurks knee in the small of his back cannoned him
into Stalky who punted him back You ought to be hung

And the Head ought to get the VC said Stalky Why he might have
been dead _and_ buried by now But he wasnt But he didnt Ho ho He
just nipped through the hedge like a lusty old blackbird Extraspecial
five hundred lines an gated for a weekall sereno

Ive read o somethin like that in a book said Beetle Gummy what
a chap Just think of it

Im thinking said McTurk and he delivered a wild Irish yell that
made the team turn round

Shut your fat mouth said Stalky dancing with impatience Leave it
to your Uncle Stalky and hell have the Head on toast If you say
a word Beetle till I give you leave I swear Ill slay you
_Habeo Capitem crinibus minimis_ Ive got him by the short hairs Now
look as if nothing had happened

There was no need of guile The school was too busy cheering the drawn
match It hung round the lavatories regardless of muddy boots while the
team washed It cheered Crandall minor whenever it caught sight of him
and it cheered more wildly than ever after prayers because the Old Boys
in evening dress openly twirling their mustaches attended and
instead of standing with the masters ranged themselves along the
wall immediately before the prefects and the Head called them over
toomajors minors and tertiuses after their old names

Yes its all very fine he said to his guests after dinner but the
boys are getting a little out of hand There will be trouble and sorrow
later Im afraid Youd better turn in early Crandall The dormitory
will be sitting up for you I dont know to what dizzy heights you may
climb in your profession but I do know youll never get such absolute
adoration as youre getting now

Confound the adoration I want to finish my cigar sir

Its all pure gold Go where glory waits Crandallminor

The setting of that apotheosis was a tenbed attic dormitory
communicating through doorless openings with three others The gas
flickered over the raw pine washstands There was an incessant
whistling of drafts and outside the naked windows the sea beat on the
Pebbleridge

Same old bedsame old mattress I believe said Crandall yawning
Same old everything Oh but Im lame Id no notion you chaps could
play like this He caressed a battered shin Youve given us all
something to remember you by

It needed a few minutes to put them at their ease and in some way they
could not understand they were more easy when Crandall turned round and
said his prayersa ceremony he had neglected for some years

Oh I _am_ sorry Ive forgotten to put out the gas

Please dont bother said the prefect of the dormitory Worthington
does that

A nightgowned twelveyearold who had been waiting to show off leaped
from his bed to the bracket and back again by way of a washstand

How dyou manage when hes asleep said Crandall chuckling

Shove a cold cleek down his neck

It was a wet sponge when I was junior in the dormitory Hullo Whats
happening

The darkness had filled with whispers the sound of trailing rugs bare
feet on bare boards protests giggles and threats such as

Be quiet you ass Squattezvous on the floor then I swear you
arent going to sit on _my_ bed Mind the toothglass etc

StaCorkran said the prefect began his tone showing his sense of
Stalkys insolence that perhaps youd tell us about that business with
Duncans body

Yesyesyes ran the keen whispers Tell us

Theres nothing to tell What on earth are you chaps hoppin about in
the cold for

Never mind us said the voices Tell about FatSow

So Crandall turned on his pillow and spoke to the generation he could
not see

Well about three months ago he was commanding a treasureguarda cart
full of rupees to pay troops withfive thousand rupees in silver He
was comin to a place called Fort Pearson near Kalabagh

I was born there squeaked a small fag It was called after my
uncle

Shut upyou and your uncle Never mind him Crandall

Well neer mind The Afridis found out that this treasure was on the
move and they ambushed the whole show a couple of miles before he got
to the fort and cut up the escort Duncan was wounded and the escort
hooked it There werent more than twenty Sepoys all told and there
were any amount of Afridis As things turned out I was in charge at
Fort Pearson Fact was Id heard the firing and was just going to see
about it when Duncans men came up So we all turned back together
They told me something about an officer but I couldnt get the hang of
things till I saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open
propped up on one arm blazing away with a revolver You see the escort
had abandoned the cart and the Afridistheyre an awfully suspicious
gangthought the retreat was a trapsort of draw you knowand the
cart was the bait So they had left poor old Duncan alone Minute they
spotted how few we were it was a race across the flat who should reach
old Duncan first We ran and they ran and we won and after a little
hackin about they pulled off I never knew it was one of us till I was
right on top of him There are heaps of Duncans in the service and of
course the name didnt remind me He wasnt changed at all hardly Hed
been shot through the lungs poor old man and he was pretty thirsty
I gave him a drink and sat down beside him andfunny thing toohe
said Hullo Toffee and I said Hullo FatSow hope you arent
hurt or something of the kind But he died in a minute or twonever
lifted his head off my knees I say you chaps out there will get your
death of cold Better go to bed

All right In a minute But your cutsyour cuts How did you get
wounded

That was when we were taking the body back to the Fort They came on
again and there was a bit of a scrimmage

Did you kill any one

Yes Shouldnt wonder Goodnight

Goodnight Thank you Crandall Thanks awfly Crandall Goodnight

The unseen crowds withdrew His own dormitory rustled into bed and lay
silent for a while

I say CrandallStalkys voice was tuned to a wholly foreign
reverence

Well what

Suppose a chap found another chap croaking with diphtheriaall bunged
up with itand they stuck a tube in his throat and the chap sucked the
stuff out what would you say

Um said Crandall reflectively Ive only heard of one case and
that was a doctor He did it for a woman

Oh this wasnt a woman It was just a boy

Makes it all the finer then Its about the bravest thing a man can
do Why

Oh I heard of a chap doin it Thats all

Then hes a brave man

Would _you_ funk it

Raather Anybody would Fancy dying of diphtheria in cold blood

Wellah Er Look here The sentence ended in a grunt for Stalky had
leaped out of bed and with McTurk was sitting on the head of Beetle who
would have sprung the mine there and then

Next day which was the last of the term and given up to a few wholly
unimportant examinations began with wrath and war Mr King had
discovered that nearly all his houseit lay as you know next door but
one to Prouts in the long range of buildingshad unlocked the doors
between the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story told by
Crandall He went to the Head clamorous injured appealing for
he never approved of allowing socalled young men of the world to
contaminate the morals of boyhood Very good said the Head he would
attend to it

Well Im awfly sorry said Crandall guiltily I dont think I told
em anything they oughtnt to hear Dont let them get into trouble on
my account

Tck the Head answered with the ghost of a wink It isnt the boys
that make trouble its the masters However Prout and King dont
approve of dormitory gatherings on this scale and one must back up the
housemasters Moreover its hopeless to punish two houses only so
late in the term We must be fair and include everybody Lets see They
have a holiday task for the Easters which of course none of them
will ever look at We will give the whole school except prefects and
studyboys regular prep tonight and the Commonroom will have to
supply a master to take it We must be fair to all

Prep on the last night of the term Whew said Crandall thinking of
his own wild youth I fancy there will be larks

The school frolicking among packed trunks whooping down the corridor
and gloating in formrooms received the news with amazement and rage
No school in the world did prep on the last night of the term This
thing was monstrous tyrannical subversive of law religion and
morality They would go into the formrooms and they would take their
degraded holiday task with them buthere they smiled and speculated
what manner of man the Commonroom would send up against them The lot
fell on Mason credulous and enthusiastic who loved youth No other
master was anxious to take that prep for the school lacked the
steadying influence of tradition and men accustomed to the ordered
routine of ancient foundations found it occasionally insubordinate The
four long formrooms in which all below the rank of studyboys worked
received him with thunders of applause Ere he had coughed twice they
favored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great
Britain as recorded by the High Priest of the Israelites and commented
on by the leader of the host The lower forms reminded him that it was
the last day and that therefore he must take it all in play When he
dashed off to rebuke them the Lower Fourth and Upper Third began with
one accord to be sick loudly and realistically Mr Mason tried of all
vain things under heaven to argue with them and a bold soul at a
back desk bade him take fifty lines for not olding up is and before
speaking As one who prided himself upon the perfection of his English
this cut Mason to the quick and while he was trying to discover the
offender the Upper and Lower Second three formrooms away turned out
the gas and threw inkpots It was a pleasant and stimulating prep
 The studyboys and prefects heard the echoes of it far off and the
Commonroom at dessert smiled

Stalky waited watch in hand till halfpast eight If it goes on much
longer the Head will come up said he Well tell the studies first
and then the dormrooms Look sharp

He allowed no time for Beetle to be dramatic or McTurk to drawl They
poured into study after study told their tale and went again so soon
as they saw they were understood waiting for no comment while the
noise of that unholy prep grew and deepened By the door of Flints
study they met Mason flying towards the corridorHes gone to fetch
the Head Hurry up Come on They broke into Number Twelve formroom
abreast and panting

The Head The Head The Head That call stilled the tumult for a
minute and Stalky leaping to a desk shouted He went and sucked the
diphtheria stuff out of Stettson majors throat when we thought he was
in town Stop rotting you asses Stettson major would have croaked if
the Head hadnt done it The Head might have died himself Crandall
says its the bravest thing any livin man can do and Ihis voice
crackedthe Head dont know we know

McTurk and Beetle jumping from desk to desk drove the news home among
the junior forms There was a pause and then Mason behind him the
Head entered It was in the established order of things that no boy
should speak or move under his eye He expected the hush of awe He was
received with cheerssteady ceaseless cheering Being a wise man he
went away and the forms were silent and a little frightened

Its all right said Stalky He cant do much Tisnt as if youd
pulled the desks up like we did when old Carleton took prep once Keep
it up Hear em cheering in the studies He rocketed out with a yell
to find Flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor

When the Head of a limited liability company paying four per cent is
cheered on his saintly way to prayers not only by four formrooms of
boys waiting punishment but by his trusted prefects he can either
ask for an explanation or go his road with dignity while the senior
housemaster glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and
trembling mathematical master that certain methodsnot his thank
Godusually produce certain results Out of delicacy the Old Boys
did not attend that callover and it was to the school drawn up in the
gymnasium that the Head spoke icily

It is not often that I do not understand you but I confess I do not
tonight Some of you after your idiotic performances at prep seem to
think me a fit person to cheer I am going to show you that I am not

Crashcrashcrashcame the triple cheer that disproved it and the
Head glowered under the gas That is enough You will gain nothing The
little boys the Lower School did not like that form of address will do
me three hundred lines apiece in the holidays I shall take no further
notice of them The Upper School will do me one thousand lines apiece in
the holidays to be shown up the evening of the day they come back And
further

Gummy what a glutton Stalky whispered

For your behavior towards Mr Mason I intend to lick the whole of the
Upper School tomorrow when I give you your journeymoney This will
include the three studyboys I found dancing on the formroom desks when
I came up Prefects will stay after callover

The school filed out in silence but gathered in groups by the gymnasium
door waiting what might befall

And now Flint said the Head will you be good enough to give me
some explanation of your conduct

Well sir said Flint desperately if you save a chaps life at the
risk of your own when hes dyin of diphtheria and the Coll finds it
out whawhat can you expect sir

Um I see Then that noise was not meant forah cheek I can connive
at immorality but I cannot stand impudence However it does not excuse
their insolence to Mr Mason Ill forego the lines this once remember
but the lickings hold good

When this news was made public the school lost in wonder and
admiration gasped at the Head as he went to his house Here was a man
to be reverenced On the rare occasions when he caned he did it
very scientifically and the execution of a hundred boys would be
epicimmense

Its all right Head Sahib _We_ know said Crandall as the Head
slipped off his gown with a grunt in his smokingroom I found out just
now from our substitute He was gettin my opinion of your performance
last night in the dormitory I didnt know then that it was you he was
talkin about Crafty young animal Freckled chap with eyesCorkran I
think his name is

Oh I know _him_ thank you said the Head and reflectively Yees
I should have included them even if I hadnt seen em

If the old Coll werent a little above themselves already wed chair
you down the corridor said the Engineer Oh Bates how could you
You might have caught it yourself and where would we have been then

I always knew you were worth twenty of us any day Now Im sure of it
 said the Squadron Commander looking round for contradictions

He isnt fit to manage a school though Promise youll never do it
again Bates Sahib Wewe cant go away comfy in our minds if you take
these risks said the Gunner

Bates Sahib you arent ever goin to cane the whole Upper School are
you said Crandall

I can connive at immorality as I said but I cant stand impudence
Masons lot is quite hard enough even when I back him Besides the
men at the golfclub heard them singing Aaron and Moses I shall have
complaints about that from the parents of dayboys Decency must be
preserved

Were coming to help said all the guests


The Upper School were caned one after the other their overcoats over
their arms the brakes waiting in the road below to take them to the
station their journeymoney on the table The Head began with Stalky
McTurk and Beetle He dealt faithfully by them

And heres your journeymoney Goodby and pleasant holidays

Goodby Thank you sir Goodby

They shook hands Desire dont outrun performancemuchthis mornin
We got the cream of it said Stalky Now wait till a few chaps come
out and well really cheer him

Dont wait on our account please said Crandall speaking for the Old
Boys Were going to begin now

It was very well so long as the cheering was confined to the corridor
but when it spread to the gymnasium when the boys awaiting their
turn cheered the Head gave it up in despair and the remnant flung
themselves upon him to shake hands Then they seriously devoted
themselves to cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises in
dumbshow

Didnt I say Id get even with him said Stalky on the boxseat as
they swung into the narrow Northam street Now all togethertakin
time from your Uncle Stalky

 Its a way we have in the Army
 Its a way we have in the Navy
 Its a way we have at the Public Schools
 Which nobody can deny




THE FLAG OF THEIR COUNTRY


It was winter and bitter cold of mornings Consequently Stalky and
BeetleMcTurk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet
under all circumstancesdrowsed till the last moment before turning out
to callover in the gaslit gymnasium It followed that they were often
late and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark and since
three black marks a week meant defaulters drill equally it followed
that they spent hours under the Sergeants hand Foxy drilled the
defaulters with all the pomp of his old paradeground Dont think its
any pleasure to me his introduction never varied Id much sooner
be smoking a quiet pipe in my own quartersbut I see we ave the Old
Brigade on our ands this afternoon If I only ad you regular Muster
Corkran said he dressing the line

Youve had me for nearly six weeks you old glutton Number off from
the right

Not _quite_ so previous please Im taking this drill Left
halfturn Slowmarch Twentyfive sluggards all old offenders
filed into the gymnasium Quietly provide yourselves with the requisite
dumbbells returnin quietly to your place Number off from the right
in a low voice Odd numbers one pace to the front Even numbers stand
fast Now leanin forward from the ips takin your time from me

The dumbbells rose and fell clashed and were returned as one The boys
were experts at the weary game

Very good I shall be sorry when any of you resume your abits of
punctuality Quietly return dumbbells We will now try some simple
drill

Ugh I know that simple drill

It would he ighly to your discredit if you did not Muster Corkran
_At_ the same time it is not so easy as it looks

Bet you a bob I can drill as well as you Foxy

Well see later Now try to imagine you aint defaulters at all but
an arf company on parade me bein your commandin officer Theres
no call to laugh If youre lucky most of you will ave to take drills
arf your life Do me a little credit Youve been at it long enough
goodness knows

They were formed into fours marched wheeled and countermarched the
spell of ordered motion strong on them As Foxy said they had been at
it a long time

The gymnasium door opened revealing McTurk in charge of an old
gentleman

The Sergeant leading a wheel did not see Not so bad he murmured
Not arf so bad The pivotman of the wheel _honly_ marks time Muster
Swayne Now Muster Corkran you say you know the drill Oblige me by
takin over the command and reversin my words step by step relegate
them to their previous formation

Whats this Whats this cried the visitor authoritatively

Aa little drill sir stammered Foxy saying nothing of first
causes

Excellentexcellent I only wish there were more of it he chirruped
Dont let me interrupt You were just going to hand over to someone
werent you

He sat down breathing frostily in the chill air I shall muck it I
know I shall whispered Stalky uneasily and his discomfort was not
lightened by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was
General Collinson a member of the College Board of Council

Ehwhat said Foxy

Collinson KCBHe commanded the Pompadoursmy fathers old
regiment hissed Swayne major

Take your time said the visitor _I_ know how it feels Your first
drilleh

Yes sir He drew an unhappy breath Tention Dress The echo of
his own voice restored his confidence

The wheel was faced about flung back broken into fours and restored
to line without a falter The official hour of punishment was long
passed but no one thought of that They were backing up StalkyStalky
in deadly fear lest his voice should crack

He does you credit Sergeant was the visitors comment A good
drilland good material to drill Now its an extraordinary thing
Ive been lunching with your headmaster and he never told me you had a
cadetcorps in the College

We avent sir This is only a little drill said the Sergeant

But arent they keen on it said McTurk speaking for the first time
with a twinkle in his deepset eyes

Why arent you in it though Willy

Oh Im not punctual enough said McTurk The Sergeant only takes the
pick of us

Dismiss Break off cried Foxy fearing an explosion in the ranks
II ought to have told you sir that

But you should have a cadetcorps The General pursued his own line of
thought You _shall_ have a cadetcorps too if my recommendation
in Council is any use I dont know when Ive been so pleased Boys
animated by a spirit like yours should set an example to the whole
school

They do said McTurk

Bless my soul Can it be so late Ive kept my fly waiting half an
hour Well I must run away Nothing like seeing things for ones self
Which end of the buildings does one get out at Will you show me Willy
Who was that boy who took the drill

Corkran I think his name is

You ought to know him Thats the kind of boy you should cultivate
Evidently an unusual sort A wonderful sight Five and twenty boys who
I dare say would much sooner be playing cricketit was the depth
of winter but grown people especially those who have lived long in
foreign parts make these little errors and McTurk did not correct
himdrilling for the sheer love of it A shame to waste so much good
stuff but I think I can carry my point

An whos your friend with the white whiskers demanded Stalky on
McTurks return to the study

General Collinson He comes over to shoot with my father sometimes
Rather a decent old bargee too He said I ought to cultivate your
acquaintance Stalky

Did he tip you McTurk exhibited a blessed whole sovereign

Ah said Stalky annexing it for he was treasurer Well have a
hefty brew Youd pretty average cool cheek Turkey to jaw about our
keenness an punctuality

Didnt the old boy know we were defaulters said Beetle

Not him He came down to lunch with the Head I found him pokin about
the place on his own hook afterwards an I thought Id show him the
giddy drill When I found he was so pleased I wasnt goin to damp his
giddy ardor He mightnt ha given me the quid if I had

Wasnt old Foxy pleased Did you see him get pink behind the ears
 said Beetle It was an awful score for him Didnt we back him
up beautifully Lets go down to Keytes and get some cocoa and
sassingers

They overtook Foxy speeding down to retail the adventure to Keyte who
in his time had been Troop SergeantMajor in a cavalry regiment and
now warworn veteran was local postmaster and confectioner

You owe us something said Stalky with meaning

Im ighly grateful Muster Corkran Ive ad to run against you pretty
hard in the way o business now and then but I will say that outside
o businessbounds an smokin an such likeI dont wish to have a
more trustworthy young gentleman to elp me out of a hole The way
you andled the drill was beautiful though I say it Now if you come
regular henceforward

But hell have to be late three times a week said Beetle You cant
expect a chap to do thatjust to please you Foxy

Ah thats true Still if you could manage itand you Muster
Beetleit would give you a big start when the cadetcorps is formed I
expect the General will recommend it

They raided Keytes very much at their own sweet will for the old man
who knew them well was deep in talk with Foxy I make what weve
taken seven and six Stalky called at last over the counter but youd
better count for yourself

Nono Id take your word any day Muster CorkranIn the Pompadours
was he Sergeant We lay with them once at Umballa I think it was

I dont know whether this hamandtongue tin is eighteen pence or one
an four

Say one an fourpence Muster Corkran Of course Sergeant if it was
any use to give my time Id be pleased to do it but Im too old Id
like to see a drill again

Oh come on Stalky cried McTurk He isnt listenin to you Chuck
over the money

I want the quid changed you ass Keyte Private Keyte Corporal Keyte
TerroopSergeantMajor Keyte will you give me change for a quid

Yesyes of course Seven an six He stared abstractedly pushed the
silver over and melted away into the darkness of the back room

Now those twoll jaw about the Mutiny till teatime said Beetle

Old Keyte was at Sobraon said Stalky Hear him talk about that
sometimes Beats Foxy hollow


The Heads face inscrutable as ever was bent over a pile of letters

What do you think he said at last to the Reverend John Gillett

Its a good idea Theres no denying thatan estimable idea

We concede that much Well

I have my doubts about itthats all The more I know of boys the less
do I profess myself capable of following their moods but I own I shall
be very much surprised if the scheme takes Itit isnt the temper of
the school We prepare for the Army

My businessin _this_ matteris to carry out the wishes of the
Council They demand a volunteer cadetcorps A volunteer cadetcorps
will be furnished I have suggested however that we need not embark
upon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled General Collinson is
sending us fifty lethal weaponscutdown Sniders he calls themall
carefully plugged

Yes that is necessary in a school that uses loaded saloonpistols to
the extent we do The Reverend John smiled

Therefore there will be no outlay except the Sergeants time

But if he fails you will be blamed

Oh assuredly I shall post a notice in the corridor this afternoon
and

I shall watch the result


Kindly keep your ands off the new armrack Foxy wrestled with a
turbulent crowd in the gymnasium Nor it wont do even a condemned
Snider any good to be continual snappin the lock Mr SwayneYiss
the uniforms will come later when were more proficient at present we
will confine ourselves to drill I am ere for the purpose o takin the
names o those willin to joinPut down that Snider Muster Hogan

What are you goin to do Beetle said a voice

Ive had all the drill _I_ want thank you

What After all youve learned Come on Dont be a scab Theyll make
you corporal in a week cried Stalky

Im not goin up for the Army Beetle touched his spectacles

Hold on a shake Foxy said Hogan Where are you goin to drill us

Herein the gymtill you are fit an capable to be taken out on the
road The Sergeant threw a chest

For all the Northam cads to look at Not good enough Foxibus

Well we wont make a point of it You learn your drill first an
later well see

Hullo said Ansell of Macreas shouldering through the mob Whats
all this about a giddy cadetcorps

It will save you a lot o time at Sandburst the Sergeant replied
promptly Youll be dismissed your drills early if you go up with a
good groundin beforeand

Hm Dont mind learnin my drill but Im not goin to ass about the
country with a toy Snider Perowne what are you goin to do Hogans
joinin

Dont know whether Ive the time said Perowne Ive got no end of
extratu as it is

Well call this extratu said Ansell Twont take us long to mug up
the drill

Oh thats right enough but what about marchin in public said
Hogan not foreseeing that three years later he should die in the
Burmese sunlight outside Minhla Fort

Afraid the uniform wont suit your creamy complexion McTurk asked
with a villainous sneer

Shut up Turkey You arent goin up for the Army

No but Im goin to send a substitute Hi Morrell an Wake You two
fags by the armrack youve got to volunteer

Blushing deeplythey had been too shy to apply beforethe youngsters
sidled towards the Sergeant

But I dont want the little chapsnot at first said the
Sergeant disgustedly I wantId like some of the Old Brigade the
defaultersto stiffen em a bit

Dont be ungrateful Sergeant Theyre nearly as big as you get em
in the Army now McTurk read the papers of those years and could be
trusted for general information which he used as he used his tweaker
 Yet he did not know that Wake minor would be a bimbashi of the Egyptian
Army ere his thirtieth year

Hogan Swayne Stalky Perowne and Ansell were deep in consultation by
the vaultinghorse Stalky as usual laying down the law The Sergeant
watched them uneasily knowing that many waited on their lead

Foxy dont like my recruits said McTurk in a pained tone to Beetle
You get him some

Nothing loath Beetle pinioned two more fagseach no taller than a
carbine Here you are Foxy Heres food for powder Strike for your
hearths an homes you young brutesan be jolly quick about it

Still he isnt happy said McTurk

 For the way we have with our Army
 Is the way we have with our Navy

Here Beetle joined in They had found the poem in an old volume of
Punch and it seemed to cover the situation

 An both of em led to adversity
 Which nobody can deny

You be quiet young gentlemen If you cant elpdont inder Foxys
eye was still on the council by the horse Carter White and Tyrrell
all boys of influence had joined it The rest fingered the rifles
irresolutely Wait a shake cried Stalky Cant we turn out those
rotters before we get to work

Certainly said Foxy Any one wishful to join will stay ere Those
who do not so intend will go out quietly closin the door beind em

Half a dozen of the earnestminded rushed at them and they had just
time to escape into the corridor

Well why dont you join Beetle asked resettling his collar

Why didnt you

Whats the good We arent goin up for the Army Besides I know the
drillall except the manual of course Wonder what theyre doin
inside

Makin a treaty with Foxy Didnt you hear Stalky say Thats what
well doan if he dont like it he can lump it Theyll use Foxy for
a cram Cant you see you idiot Theyre goin up for Sandhurst or the
Shop in less than a year Theyll learn their drill an then theyll
drop it like a shot Dyou suppose chaps with their amount of extratu
are takin up volunteerin for fun

Well I dont know I thought of doin a poem about itrottin em
you knowThe Ballad of the Dogshooterseh

I dont think you can because Kingll be down on the corps like a
cartload o bricks He hasnt been consulted hes sniffin round the
noticeboard now Lets lure him They strolled up carelessly towards
the honsemastera most meek couple

Hows this said King with a start of feigned surprise Methought you
would be learning to fight for your country

I think the companys full sir said McTurk

Its a great pity sighed Beetle

Forty valiant defenders have we then How noble What devotion
I presume that it is possible that a desire to evade their normal
responsibilities may be at the bottom of this zeal Doubtless they will
be accorded special privileges like the Choir and the Natural History
Societyone must not say Bughunters

Oh I suppose so sir said McTurk cheerily The Head hasnt said
anything about it yet but he will of course

Oh sure to

It is just possible my Beetle King wheeled on the last speaker
that the housemastersa necessary but somewhat neglected factor in
our humble scheme of existencemay have a word to say on the matter
Life for the young at least is not all weapons and munitions of war
Education is incidentally one of our aims

What a consistent pig he is cooed McTurk when they were out of
earshot One always knows where to have him Did you see how he rose to
that draw about the Head and special privileges

Confound him he might have had the decency to have backed the scheme
I could do such a lovely ballad rottin it and now Ill have to be a
giddy enthusiast It dont bar our pulling Stalkys leg in the study
does it

Oh no but in the Coll we must be procadetcorps like anything
Cant you make up a giddy epigram _a la Catullus_ about King
objectin to it Beetle was at this noble task when Stalky returned all
hot from his first drill

Hullo my ramrodbunger began McTurk Wheres your dead dog Is it
Defence or Defiance

Defiance said Stalky and leaped on him at that word Look here
Turkey you mustnt rot the corps Weve arranged it beautifully Foxy
swears he wont take us out into the open till we say we want to go

_Dis_gustin exhibition of immature infants apin the idiosyncrasies
of their elders Snff

Have you drawn King Beetle Stalky asked in a pause of the scuffle

Not exactly but thats his genial style

Well listen to your Uncle Stalkywho is a great man Moreover
and subsequently Foxys goin to let us drill the corps in
turn_privatim et seriatim_so that well all know how to handle a
half company anyhow _Ergo_ an _propter hoc_ when we go to the Shop
we shall be dismissed drill early thus my beloved earers combinin
education with wholesome amusement

I knew youd make a sort of extratu of it you coldblooded brute
 said McTurk Dont you want to die for your giddy country

Not if I can jolly well avoid it So you mustnt rot the corps

Wed decided on that years ago said Beetle scornfully Kingll do
the rottin

Then youve got to rot King my giddy poet Make up a good catchy
Limerick and let the fags sing it

Look here you stick to volunteerin and dont jog the table

He wont have anything to take hold of said Stalky with dark
significance

They did not know what that meant till a few days later they proposed
to watch the corps at drill They found the gymnasium door locked and a
fag on guard This is sweet cheek said McTurk stooping

Mustnt look through the keyhole said the sentry

I like that Why Wake you little beast I made you a volunteer

Cant help it My orders are not to allow any one to look

Spose we do said McTurk Spose we jolly well slay you

My orders are I am to give the name of anybody who interfered with
me on my post to the corps an theyd deal with him after drill
accordin to martial law

What a brute Stalky is said Beetle They never doubted for a moment
who had devised that scheme

You esteem yourself a giddy centurion dont you said Beetle
listening to the crash and rattle of grounded arms within

My orders are not to talk except to explain my orderstheyll lick me
if I do

McTurk looked at Beetle The two shook their heads and turned away

I swear Stalky _is_ a great man said Beetle after a long pause One
consolation is that this sort of secretsociety biznai will drive King
wild

It troubled many more than King but the members of the corps were muter
than oysters Foxy being bound by no vow carried his woes to Keyte

I never come across such nonsense in my life Theyve tiled the lodge
inner and outer guard all complete and then they get to work keen as
mustard

But whats it all for asked the exTroop SergeantMajor

To learn their drill You never saw anything like it They begin after
Ive dismissed empractisin tricks but out into the open they will
_not_ comenot for ever so The ole thing is preposterous If youre
a cadetcorps _I_ say be a cadetcorps instead o hidin beind
locked doors

And what do the authorities say about it

That beats me again The Sergeant spoke fretfully I go to the Ead
an e gives me no help Theres times when I think hes makin fun o
me Ive never been a Volunteersergeant thank Godbut Ive always had
the consideration to pity em Im glad o that

Id like to see em said Keyte From your statements Sergeant I
cant get at what theyre after

Dont ask me Major Ask that frecklefaced young Corkran Hes their
generalissimo

One does not refuse a warrior of Sobraon or deny the only pastrycook
within bounds So Keyte came by invitation leaning upon a stick
tremulous with old age to sit in a corner and watch

They shape well They shape uncommon well he whispered between
evolutions

Oh this isnt what theyre after Wait till I dismiss em

At the breakoff the ranks stood fast Perowne fell out faced them
and refreshing his memory by glimpses at a redbound metalclasped
book drilled them for ten minutes This is that Perowne who was shot
in Equatorial Africa by his own men Ansell followed him and Hogan
followed Ansell All three were implicitly obeyed Then Stalky laid
aside his Snider and drawing a long breath favored the company with a
blast of withering invective

Old ard Muster Corkran That aint in any drill cried Foxy

All right Sergeant You never know what you may have to say to your
menFor pitys sake try to stand up without leanin against each
other you bleareyed herringutted guttersnipes Its no pleasure to
me to comb you out That ought to have been done before you came here
youyou militia broomstealers

The old touchthe old touch _We_ know it said Keyte wiping his
rheumy eyes But where did he pick it up

From his fatheror his uncle Dont ask me Half of em must have been
born within earshot o the barracks Foxy was not far wrong in his
guess Ive heard more backtalk since this volunteerin nonsense
began than Ive heard in a year in the service

Theres a rearrank man lookin as though his belly were in the
pawnshop Yes you Private Ansell and Stalky tonguelashed the
victim for three minutes in gross and in detail

Hullo He returned to his normal tone First blood to me You
flushed Ansell You wriggled

Couldnt help flushing was the answer Dont think I wriggled
though

Well its your turn now Stalky resumed his place in the ranks

Lord Lord Its as good as a play chuckled the attentive Keyte
Ansell too had been blessed with relatives in the service and slowly
in a lazy drawlhis style was more reflective than Stalkysdescended
the abysmal depths of personality

Blood to me he shouted triumphantly You couldnt stand it either
 Stalky was a rich red and his Snider shook visibly

I didnt think I would he said struggling for composure but after
a bit I got in no end of a bait Curious aint it

Good for the temper said the slowmoving Hogan as they returned arms
to the rack

Did you ever said Foxy hopelessly to Keyte

I dont know much about volunteers but its the rummiest show I ever
saw I can see what theyre gettin at though Lord how often Ive
been told off an dressed down in my day They shape wellextremely
well they shape

If I could get em out into the open theres nothing I couldnt do
with em Major Perhaps when the uniforms come down theyll change
their mind

Indeed it was time that the corps made some concession to the curiosity
of the school Thrice had the guard been maltreated and thrice had the
corps dealt out martial law to the offender The school raged What was
the use they asked of a cadetcorps which none might see Mr King
congratulated them on their invisible defenders and they could not
parry his thrusts Foxy was growing sullen and restive A few of the
corps expressed openly doubts as to the wisdom of their course and the
question of uniforms loomed on the near horizon If these were issued
they would be forced to wear them

But as so often happens in this life the matter was suddenly settled
from without

The Head had duly informed the Council that their recommendation had
been acted upon and that so far as he could learn the boys were
drilling He said nothing of the terms on which they drilled Naturally
General Collinson was delighted and told his friends One of his friends
rejoiced in a friend a Member of Parliamenta zealous an intelligent
and above all a patriotic person anxious to do the most good in the
shortest possible time But we cannot answer alas for the friends of
our friends If Collinsons friend had introduced him to the General
the latter would have taken his measure and saved much But the friend
merely spoke of his friend and since no two people in the world see eye
to eye the picture conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate Moreover the
man was an MP an impeccable Conservative and the General had the
English soldiers lurking respect for any member of the Court of Last
Appeal He was going down into the West country to spread light in
somebodys benighted constituency Wouldnt it be a good idea if armed
with the Generals recommendation he taking the admirable and newly
established cadetcorps for his text spoke a few wordsJust talked
to the boys a littleeh You know the kind of thing that would be
acceptable and hed be the very man to do it The sort of talk that
boys understand you know

They didnt talk to em much in my time said the General
suspiciously

Ah but times changewith the spread of education and so on The boys
of today are the men of tomorrow An impression in youth is likely to
be permanent And in these times you know with the country going to
the dogs

Youre quite right The island was then entering on five years of Mr
Gladstones rule and the General did not like what he had seen of it
He would certainly write to the Head for it was beyond question that
the boys of today made the men of tomorrow That if he might say so
was uncommonly well put

In reply the Head stated that he should be delighted to welcome Mr
Raymond Martin MP of whom he had heard so much to put him up for
the night and to allow him to address the school on any subject that
he conceived would interest them If Mr Martin had not yet faced an
audience of this particular class of British youth the Head had no
doubt that he would find it an interesting experience

And I dont think I am very far wrong in that last he confided to the
Reverend John Do you happen to know anything of one Raymond Martin

I was at College with a man of that name the chaplain replied
He was without form and void so far as I remember but desperately
earnest

He will address the Coll on Patriotism next Saturday

If there is one thing our boys detest more than another it is having
their Saturday evenings broken into Patriotism has no chance beside
brewing

Nor art either Dyou remember our Evening with Shakespeare
 The Heads eyes twinkled Or the humorous gentleman with the magic
lantern


An who the dooce is this Raymond Martin MP demanded Beetle when
he read the notice of the lecture in the corridor Why do the brutes
always turn up on a Saturday

Ouh Reomeo Reomeo Wherefore art thou Reomeo said McTurk over his
shoulder quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term Well he wont
be as bad as _her_ I hope Stalky are you properly patriotic Because
if you aint this chaps goin to make you

Hope he wont take up the whole of the evening I suppose weve got to
listen to him

Wouldnt miss him for the world said McTurk A lot of chaps thought
that RomeoRomeo woman was a bore _I_ didnt I liked her Member
when she began to hiccough in the middle of it Praps hell hiccough
Whoever gets into the Gym first bags seats for the other two


There was no nervousness but a brisk and cheery affability about Mr
Raymond Martin MP as he drove up watched by many eyes to the
Heads house

Looks a bit of a bargee was McTurks comment Shouldnt be surprised
if he was a Radical He rowed the driver about the fare I heard him

That was his giddy patriotism Beetle explained After tea they joined
the rush for seats secured a private and invisible corner and began
to criticise Every gasjet was lit On the little dais at the far end
stood the Heads official desk whence Mr Martin would discourse and a
ring of chairs for the masters

Entered then Foxy with official port and leaned something like a
cloth rolled round a stick against the desk No one in authority was yet
present so the school applauded crying Whats that Foxy What are
you stealin the gentlemans brolly forWe dont birch here We cane
Take away that baubleNumber off from the rightand so forth till
the entry of the Head and the masters ended all demonstrations

One good jobthe Commonroom hate this as much as we do Watch King
wrigglin to get out of the draft

Wheres the Raymondiferous Martin Punctuality my beloved earers is
the image o war

Shut up Heres the giddy Dook Golly what a dewlap Mr Martin
in evening dress was undeniably throatya tall generously designed
pinkandwhite man Still Beetle need not have been coarse

Look at his back while hes talkin to the Head Vile bad form to turn
your back on the audience Hes a Philistinea Boppera Jebusitean
a Hivite McTurk leaned back and sniffed contemptuously

In a few colorless words the Head introduced the speaker and sat
down amid applause When Mr Martin took the applause to himself they
naturally applauded more than ever It was some time before he could
begin He had no knowledge of the schoolits tradition or heritage He
did not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent of the
boys had been born abroadin camp cantonment or upon the high seas
or that seventyfive per cent were sons of officers in one or other of
the servicesWilloughbys Paulets De Castros Maynes Randalls after
their kindlooking to follow their fathers profession The Head might
have told him this and much more but after an hourlong dinner in his
company the Head decided to say nothing whatever Mr Raymond Martin
seemed to know so much already

He plunged into his speech with a longdrawn rasping Well boys
 that though they were not conscious of it set every young nerve ajar
He supposed they knewheywhat he had come down for It was not often
that he had an opportunity to talk to boys He supposed that boys were
very much the same kind of personssome people thought them rather
funny personsas they had been in his youth

This man said McTurk with conviction is _the_ Gadarene Swine

But they must remember that they would not always be boys They would
grow up into men because the boys of today made the men of tomorrow
and upon the men of tomorrow the fair fame of their glorious native
land depended

If this goes on my beloved earers it will be my painful duty to rot
this bargee Stalky drew a long breath through his nose

Cant do that said McTurk He aint chargin anything for his
Romeo

And so they ought to think of the duties and responsibilities of the
life that was opening before them Life was not allhe enumerated a few
games and that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact of his
fall added marbles Yes life was not he said all marbles

There was one tense gaspamong the juniors almost a shriekof
quivering horror he was a heathenan outcastbeyond the extremest
pale of tolerationselfdamned before all men Stalky bowed his head in
his hands McTurk with a bright and cheerful eye drank in every word
and Beetle nodded solemn approval

Some of them doubtless expected in a few years to have the honor of a
commission from the Queen and to wear a sword Now he himself had had
some experience of these duties as a Major in a volunteer regiment
and he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in
their midst The establishment of such an establishment conduced to a
proper and healthy spirit which if fostered would be of great benefit
to the land they loved and were so proud to belong to Some of those now
present expected he had no doubtsome of them anxiously looked
forward to leading their men against the bullets of Englands foes
to confronting the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful
manhood

Now the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid
she being made for one end only by blind Nature but man for several
With a large and healthy hand he tore down these veils and trampled
them under the wellintentioned feet of eloquence In a raucous voice
he cried aloud little matters like the hope of Honor and the dream of
Glory that boys do not discuss even with their most intimate equals
cheerfully assuming that till he spoke they had never considered these
possibilities He pointed them to shining goals with fingers which
smudged out all radiance on all horizons He profaned the most secret
places of their souls with outcries and gesticulations he bade them
consider the deeds of their ancestors in such a fashion that they were
flushed to their tingling ears Some of themthe rending voice cut a
frozen stillnessmight have had relatives who perished in defence of
their country They thought not a few of them of an old sword in a
passage or above a breakfastroom table seen and fingered by stealth
since they could walk He adjured them to emulate those illustrious
examples and they looked all ways in their extreme discomfort

Their years forbade them even to shape their thoughts clearly to
themselves They felt savagely that they were being outraged by a fat
man who considered marbles a game

And so he worked towards his perorationwhich by the way he used
later with overwhelming success at a meeting of electorswhile they
sat flushed and uneasy in sour disgust After many many words he
reached for the clothwrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom
Thisthis was the concrete symbol of their landworthy of all honor
and reverence Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to
worthily add to its imperishable lustre He shook it before thema
large calico Union Jack staring in all three colors and waited for the
thunder of applause that should crown his effort

They looked in silence They had certainly seen the thing beforedown
at the coastguard station or through a telescope halfmast high when a
brig went ashore on Braunton Sands above the roof of the Golfclub and
in Keytes window where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in
paper on each box But the College never displayed it it was no part
of the scheme of their lives the Head had never alluded to it their
fathers had not declared it unto them It was a matter shut up sacred
and apart What in the name of everything caddish was he driving at
who waved that horror before their eyes Happy thought Perhaps he was
drunk

The Head saved the situation by rising swiftly to propose a vote of
thanks and at his first motion the school clapped furiously from a
sense of relief

And I am sure he concluded the gaslight full on his face that you
will all join me in a very hearty vote of thanks to Mr Raymond Martin
for the most enjoyable address he has given us

To this day we shall never know the rights of the case The Head
vows that he did no such thing or that if he did it must have been
something in his eye but those who were present are persuaded that
he winked once openly and solemnly after the word enjoyable Mr
Raymond Martin got his applause full tale As he said Without vanity
I think my few words went to their hearts I never knew boys could cheer
like that

He left as the prayerbell rang and the boys lined up against the wall
The flag lay still unrolled on the desk Foxy regarding it with pride
for he had been touched to the quick by Mr Martins eloquence The
Head and the Commonroom standing back on the dais could not see the
glaring offence but a prefect left the line rolled it up swiftly and
as swiftly tossed it into a glove and foil locker

Then as though he had touched a spring broke out the low murmur of
content changing to quickvolleyed handclapping

They discussed the speech in the dormitories There was not one
dissentient voice Mr Raymond Martin beyond question was born in a
gutter and bred in a boardschool where they played marbles He was
further I give the barest handful from great store a Flopshus Cad
an Outrageous Stinker a Jellybellied Flagflapper this was Stalkys
contribution and several other things which it is not seemly to put
down

The volunteer cadetcorps fell in next Monday depressedly with a face
of shame Even then judicious silence might have turned the corner

Said Foxy After a fine speech like what you eard night before last
you ought to take old of your drill with _re_newed activity I dont
see how you can avoid comin out an marchin in the open now

Cant we get out of it then Foxy Stalkys fine old silky tone
should have warned him

No not with his giving the flag so generously He told me before he
left this morning that there was no objection to the corps usin it as
their own Its a handsome flag

Stalky returned his rifle to the rack in dead silence and fell out His
example was followed by Hogan and Ansell Perowne hesitated Look here
oughtnt we he began

Ill get it out of the locker in a minute said the Sergeant his back
turned Then we can

Come on shouted Stalky What the devil are you waiting for Dismiss
Break off

Whywhat thewhere the

The rattle of Sniders slammed into the rack drowned his voice as boy
after boy fell out

II dont know that I shant have to report this to the Head he
stammered

Report then and be damned to you cried Stalky white to the lips
and ran out


Rummy thing said Beetle to McTurk I was in the study doin a
simply lovely poem about the JellyBellied FlagFlapper an Stalky
came in an I said Hullo an he cursed me like a bargee and then
he began to blub like anything Shoved his head on the table and howled
Hadnt we better do something

McTurk was troubled Praps hes smashed himself up somehow

They found him with very bright eyes whistling between his teeth

Did I take you in Beetle I thought I would Wasnt it a good draw
Didnt you think I was blubbin Didnt I do it well Oh you fat old
ass And he began to pull Beetles ears and checks in the fashion that
was called milking

I knew you were blubbin Beetle replied composedly Why arent you
at drill

Drill What drill

Dont try to be a clever fool Drill in the Gym

Cause there isnt any The volunteer cadetcorps is broke
updisbandeddeadputridcorruptstinkin An if you look at me
like that Beetle Ill slay you too Oh yes an Im goin to be
reported to the Head for swearin




THE LAST TERM


It was within a few days of the holidays the termend examinations
and more important still the issue of the College paper which Beetle
edited He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of
Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law Once installed he
discovered as others have done before him that his duty was to do
the work while his friends criticized Stalky christened it the
Swillingford Patriot in pious memory of Spongeand McTurk compared
the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey Only the Head took
an interest in the publication and his methods were peculiar He gave
Beetle the run of his brownbound tobaccoscented library prohibiting
nothing recommending nothing There Beetle found a fat armchair a
silver inkstand and unlimited pens and paper There were scores and
scores of ancient dramatists there were Hakluyt his voyages French
translations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff little
tales of a heady and bewildering nature interspersed with unusual
songsPeacock was that writers name there was Borrows Lavengro
an odd theme purporting to be a translation of something called a
Rubaiyat which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own
there were hundreds of volumes of verseCrashaw Dryden Alexander
Smith L E L Lydia Sigourney Fletcher and a purple island Donne
Marlowes Faust  andthis made McTurk to whom Beetle conveyed it
sheer drunk for three daysOssian The Earthly Paradise Atalanta in
Calydon and Rossettito name only a few Then the Head drifting in
under pretense of playing censor to the paper would read here a
verse and here another of these poets opening up avenues And slow
breathing with halfshut eyes above his cigar would he speak of great
men living and journals long dead founded in their riotous youth
of years when all the planets were little newlit stars trying to find
their places in the uncaring void and he the Head knew them as young
men know one another So the regular work went to the dogs Beetle being
full of other matters and meters hoarded in secret and only told to
McTurk of an afternoon on the sands walking high and disposedly round
the wreck of the Armada galleons shouting and declaiming against the
longridged seas

Thanks in large part to their housemasters experienced distrust the
three for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to
the rank of prefectan office that went by merit and carried with it
the honor of the groundash and liberty under restrictions to use it

_But_ said Stalky come to think of it weve done more giddy
jesting with the Sixth since weve been passed over than any one else in
the last seven years

He touched his neck proudly It was encircled by the stiffest of
stickup collars which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth
And the Sixth saw those collars and said no word Pussy Abanazar or
Dick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes
or But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but
brilliantly clever boys pets of the housemasters too anxious for
their dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three
So they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads
instead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should and rejoiced
in patentleather boots on weekdays and marvellous madeup ties on
Sundaysno man rebuking McTurk was going up for Coopers Hill and
Stalky for Sandhurst in the spring and the Head had told them both
that unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays they were
safe As a trainer of colts the Head seldom erred in an estimate of
form

He had taken Beetle aside that day and given him much good advice not
one word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study
white with excitement and poured out the wondrous tale It demanded a
great belief

You begin on a hundred a year said McTurk unsympathetically Rot

And my passage out Its all settled The Head says hes been breaking
me in for this for ever so long and I never knewI never knew One
dont begin with writing straight off yknow Begin by filling in
telegrams and cutting things out o papers with scissors

Oh Scissors What an ungodly mess youll make of it said Stalky
But anyhow this will be your last term too Seven years my dearly
beloved earersthough not prefects

Not half bad years either said McTurk I shall be sorry to leave
the old Coll shant you

They looked out over the sea creaming along the Pebbleridge in the clear
winter light Wonder where we shall all be this time next year said
Stalky absently

This time five years said McTurk

Oh said Beetle my leavins between ourselves The Head hasnt told
any one I know he hasnt because Prout grunted at me today that if
I were more reasonableyahI might be a prefect next term I sppose
hes hard up for his prefects

Lets finish up with a row with the Sixth suggested McTurk

Dirty little schoolboys said Stalky who already saw himself a
Sandhurst cadet Whats the use

Moral effect quoth McTurk Leave an imperishable tradition and all
the rest of it

Better go into Bideford an pay up our debts said Stalky Ive got
three quid out of my father_ad hoc_ Dont owe more than thirty bob
either Cut along Beetle and ask the Head for leave Say you want to
correct the Swillingford Patriot

Well I do said Beetle Itll be my last issue and Id like it to
look decent Ill catch him before he goes to his lunch

Ten minutes later they wheeled out in line by grace released from
five oclock callover and all the afternoon lay before them So also
unluckily did King who never passed without witticisms But brigades of
Kings could not have ruffled Beetle that day

Aha Enjoying the study of light literature my friends said he
rubbing his hands Common mathematics are not for such soaring minds as
yours are they

One hundred a year thought Beetle smiling into vacancy

Our open incompetence takes refuge in the flowery paths of inaccurate
fiction But a day of reckoning approaches Beetle mine I myself have
prepared a few trifling foolish questions in Latin prose which can
hardly be evaded even by your practised acts of deception Yees Latin
prose I think if I may say sobut we shall see when the papers are
setUlpian serves your need Aha _Elucescebat_ quoth our friend
We shall see We shall see

Still no sign from Beetle He was on a steamer his passage paid into
the wide and wonderful worlda thousand leagues beyond Lundy Island

King dropped him with a snarl

He doesnt know Hell go on correctin exercises an jawin an
showin off before the little boys next termand next Beetle hurried
after his companions up the steep path of the furzeclad hill behind the
College

They were throwing pebbles on the top of the gasometer and the grimy
gasman in change bade them desist They watched him oil a turncock sunk
in the ground between two furzebushes

Cokey whats that for said Stalky

To turn the gas on to the kitchens said Cokey If so be I
didnt turn her on yeou young genlemen ud be larnin your book by
candlelight

Um said Stalky and was silent for at least a minute

Hullo Where are you chaps going A bend of the lane brought them
face to face with Tulke senior prefect of Kings housea smallish
whitehaired boy of the type that must be promoted on account of
its intellect and ever afterwards appeals to the Head to support its
authority when zeal has outrun discretion

The three took no sort of notice They were on lawful pass Tulke
repeated his question hotly for he had suffered many slights from
Number Five study and fancied that he had at last caught them tripping

What the devil is that to you Stalky replied with his sweetest smile

Look here Im not goinIm not goin to be sworn at by the Fifth
 sputtered Tulke

Then cut along and call a prefects meeting said McTurk knowing
Tulkes weakness

The prefect became inarticulate with rage

Mustnt yell at the Fifth that way said Stalky Its vile bad form

Cough it up ducky McTurk said calmly

II want to know what you chaps are doing out of bounds This with an
important flourish of his groundash

Ah said Stalky Now were gettin at it Why didnt you ask that
before

Well I ask it now What are you doing

Were admiring you Tulke said Stalky We think youre no end of a
fine chap dont we

We do We do A dogcart with some girls in it swept round the corner
and Stalky promptly kneeled before Tulke in the attitude of prayer so
Tulke turned a color

Ive reason to believe he began

Oyez Oyez Oyez shouted Beetle after the manner of Bidefords town
crier Tulke has reason to believe Three cheers for Tulke

They were given Its all our giddy admiration said Stalky You know
how we love you Tulke We love you so much we think you ought to go
home and die Youre too good to live Tulke

Yes said McTurk Do oblige us by dyin Think how lovely youd look
stuffed

Tulke swept up the road with an unpleasant glare in his eye

That means a prefects meetingsure pop said Stalky Honor of the
Sixth involved and all the rest of it Tulkell write notes all this
afternoon and Carson will call us up after tea They darent overlook
that

Bet you a bob he follows us said McTurk Hes Kings pet and its
scalps to both of em if were caught out We must be virtuous

Then I move we go to Mother Yeos for a last gorge We owe her about
ten bob and Maryll weep sore when she knows were leaving said
Beetle

She gave me an awful wipe on the head last timeMary said Stalky

She does if you dont duck said McTurk But she generally kisses one
back Lets try Mother Yeo

They sought a little bottlewindowed half dairy half restaurant a
darkbrewed twohundredyearold house at the head of a narrow side
street They had patronized it from the days of their fagdom and were
very much friends at home

Weve come to pay our debts mother said Stalky sliding his arm
round the fiftysixinch waist of the mistress of the establishment To
pay our debts and say goodbyandand were awfly hungry

Aie said Mother Yeo makkin love to me Im shaamed of ee

Rackon us wouldnt du no such thing if Mary was here said McTurk
lapsing into the broad North Devon that the boys used on their
campaigns

Whom takin my name in vain The inner door opened and Mary
fairhaired blueeyed and applechecked entered with a bowl of cream
in her hands McTurk kissed her Beetle followed suit with exemplary
calm Both boys were promptly cuffed

Niver kiss the maid when e can kiss the mistress said Stalky
shamelessly winking at Mother Yeo as he investigated a shelf of jams

Glad to see one of ee dont want his head slapped no more said Mary
invitingly in that direction

Neu Reckon I can get em give me said Stalky his back turned

Not by meyeou little masterpiece

Niver asked ee Theres maids to Northam Yissan Appledore An
unreproducible sniff half contempt half reminiscence rounded the
retort

Aie Yeou wont niver come to no good end Whutt be baout smellin
the cream

Tees bad said Stalky Zmell un

Incautiously Mary did as she was bid

Bidevoor kiss

Niver amiss said Stalky taking it without injury

Yeouyeouyeou Mary began bubbling with mirth

Theym better to Northammore rich laike an us gets them give back
again he said while McTurk solemnly waltzed Mother Yeo out of breath
and Beetle told Mary the sad news as they sat down to clotted cream
jam and hot bread

Yiss Yeoull niver zee us no more Mary Were goin to be passons an
missioners

Steady the Buffs said McTurk looking through the blind Tulke has
followed us Hes comin up the street now

Theyve niver put us out o bounds said Mother Yeo Bide yeou still
my little dearrs She rolled into the inner room to make the score

Mary said Stalky suddenly with tragic intensity Do ee lov me
Mary

Issfai Talled ee zo since yeou was zo high the damsel replied

Zee un comin up street then Stalky pointed to the unconscious
Tulke Heve niver been kissed by no sort or manner o maid in hees
borned laife Mary Oh tees shaamful

Whutts to do with me Twill come to un in the way o nature I
rackon She nodded her head sagaciously You niver want me to kiss
unsure_ly_

Give ee halfacrown if ee will said Stalky exhibiting the coin

Halfacrown was much to Mary Yeo and a jest was more but

Yeum afraid said McTurk at the psychological moment

Aie Beetle echoed knowing her weak point Theres not a maid to
Northam ud think twice An yeou such a fine maid tu

McTurk planted one foot firmly against the inner door lest Mother Yeo
should return inopportunely for Marys face was set It was then that
Tulke found his way blocked by a tall daughter of Devonthat county of
easy kisses the pleasantest under the sun He dodged aside politely
She reflected a moment and laid a vast hand upon his shoulder

Where be ee gwaine tu my dearr said she

Over the handkerchief he had crammed into his mouth Stalky could see the
boy turn scarlet

Gie I a kiss Dont they larn ee manners to College

Tulke gasped and wheeled Solemnly and conscientiously Mary kissed him
twice and the luckless prefect fled

She stepped into the shop her eyes full of simple wonder Kissed un
 said Stalky handing over the money

Iss fai But oh my little body hem no Colleger Zeemed tuminded
to cry like

Well we wont Yell couldnt make us cry that way said McTurk
Try

Whereupon Mary cuffed them all round

As they went out with tingling ears said Stalky generally Dont think
therell be much of a prefects meeting

Wont there just said Beetle Look here If he kissed herwhich
is our tackhe is a cynically immoral hog and his conduct is blatant
indecency _Confer orationes Regis furiosissimi_ when he collared me
readin Don Juan

Course he kissed her said McTurk In the middle of the street With
his housecap on

Time 357 pm Make a note o that What dyou mean Beetle said
Stalky

Well Hes a truthful little beast He may say he was kissed

And then

Why then Beetle capered at the mere thought of it Dont you see
The corollary to the giddy proposition is that the Sixth cant protect
emselves from outrages an ravishins Want nursemaids to look after
em Weve only got to whisper that to the Coll Jam for the Sixth Jam
for us Either way its jammy

By Gum said Stalky Our last terms endin well Now you cut along
an finish up your old rag and Turkey and me will help Well go in the
back way No need to bother Randall

Dont play the giddy gardengoat then Beetle knew what help meant
though he was by no means averse to showing his importance before his
allies The little loft behind Randalls printing office was his own
territory where he saw himself already controlling the Times Here
under the guidance of the inky apprentice he had learned to find his
way more or less circuitously about the case and considered himself an
expert compositor

The school paper in its locked formes lay on a stonetopped table a
proof by the side but not for worlds would Beetle have corrected from
the mere proof With a mallet and a pair of tweezers he knocked out
mysterious wedges of wood that released the forme picked a letter here
and inserted a letter there reading as he went along and stopping much
to chuckle over his own contributions

You wont show off like that said McTurk when youve got to do it
for your living Upside down and backwards isnt it Lets see if I can
read it

Get out said Beetle Go and read those formes in the rack there if
you think you know so much

Formes in a rack Whats that Dont be so beastly professional

McTurk drew off with Stalky to prowl about the office They left little
unturned

Come here a shake Beetle Whats this thing aid Stalky in a few
minutes Looks familiar

Said Beetle after a glance Its Kings Latin prose exam paper
_InIn Varrem actio prima_ What a lark

Think o the puresouled highminded boys whod give their eyes for a
squint at it said McTurk

No Willie dear said Stalky that would be wrong and painful to our
kind teachers You wouldnt crib Willie would you

Cant read the beastly stuff anyhow was the reply Besides were
leavin at the end o the term so it makes no difference to us

Member what the Considerate Bloomer did to Spraggons account of the
Puffinton Hounds We must sugar Mr Kings milk for him said Stalky
all lighted from within by a devilish joy Lets see what Beetle can do
with those forceps hes so proud of

Dont see now you can make Latin prose much more cockeye than it is
but well try said Beetle transposing an _aliud_ and _Asiae_ from two
sentences Lets see Well put that fullstop a little further on
and begin the sentence with the next capital Hurrah Heres three lines
that can move up all in a lump

One of those scientific rests for which this eminent huntsman is so
justly celebrated Stalky knew the Puffington run by heart

Hold on Heres a _vol__voluntate quidnam_ all by itself said
McTurk

Ill attend to her in a shake _Quidnam_ goes after _Dolabella_

Good old Dolabella murmured Stalky Dont break him Vile prose
Cicero wrote didnt he He ought to be grateful for

Hullo said McTurk over another forme What price a giddy ode
_Qui__quis_oh its _Quis multa gracilis_ o course

Bring it along Weve sugared the milk here said Stalky after a few
minutes zealous toil Never thrash your hounds unnecessarily

_Quis munditiis_ I swear thats not bad began Beetle plying the
tweezers Dont that interrogation look pretty _Heu quoties fidem_
That sounds as if the chap were anxious an excited _Cui flavam religas
in rosa_Whose flavor is relegated to a rose _Mutatosque Deos flebit
in antro_

Mute gods weepin in a cave suggested Stalky Pon my Sam Horace
needs as much lookin after asTulke

They edited him faithfully till it was too dark to see


Aha Elucescebat quoth our friend Ulpian serves my need does it
If King can make anything out of _that_ Im a blueeyed squatteroo
 said Beetle as they slid out of the loft window into a back alley of
old acquaintance and started on a threemile trot to the College But
the revision of the classics had detained them too long They halted
blown and breathless in the furze at the back of the gasometer the
College lights twinkling below ten minutes at least late for tea and
lockup

Its no good puffed McTurk Bet a bob Foxy is waiting for defaulters
under the lamp by the Fives Court Its a nuisance too because the
Head gave us long leave and one doesnt like to break it

Let me now from the bonded wareouse of my knowledge began Stalky

Oh rot Dont Jorrock Can we make a run for it snapped McTurk

Bishops boots Mr Radcliffe also condemned an spoke ighly in favor
of tops cleaned with champagne an abricot jam Wheres that thing
Cokey was twiddlin this afternoon

They heard him groping in the wet and presently beheld a great miracle
The lights of the Coastguard cottages near the sea went out the
brilliantly illuminated windows of the Golfclub disappeared and were
followed by the frontages of the two hotels Scattered villas dulled
twinkled and vanished Last of all the College lights died also They
were left in the pitchy darkness of a windy winters night

Blister my kidneys It _is_ a frost The dahlias are dead said
Stalky Bunk

They squattered through the dripping gorse as the College hummed like
an angry hive and the diningrooms chorused Gas gas gas till they
came to the edge of the sunk path that divided them from their study
Dropping that haha like bullets and rebounding like boys they dashed
to their study in less than two minutes had changed into dry trousers
and coat and ostentatiously slippered joined the mob in the
dininghall which resembled the stormcentre of a South American
revolution

Hellish dark and smells of cheese Stalky elbowed his way into
the press howling lustily for gas Cokey must have gone for a walk
Foxyll have to find him

Prout as the nearest housemaster was trying to restore order for
rude boys were flicking butterpats across chaos and McTurk had turned
on the fags teaurn so that many were parboiled and wept with an
unfeigned dolor The Fourth and Upper Third broke into the school song
the Vive la Compagnie to the accompaniment of drumming knifehandles
and the junior forms shrilled batlike shrieks and raided one anothers
victuals Two hundred and fifty boys in high condition seeking for more
light are truly earnest inquirers

When a most vile smell of gas told them that supplies had been renewed
Stalky waistcoat unbuttoned sat gorgedly over what might have been
his fourth cup of tea And thats all right he said Hullo Eres
Pomponius Ego

It was Carson the head of the school a simple straightminded soul
and a pillar of the First Fifteen who crossed over from the prefects
table and in a husky official voice invited the three to attend in his
study in half an hour Prefects meetin Prefects meetin hissed
the tables and they imitated barbarically the actions and effects of
the groundash

How are we goin to jest with em said Stalky turning halfface to
Beetle Its your play this time

Look here was the answer all I want you to do is not to laugh Im
goin to take charge o young Tulkes immorality_a la_ King and its
goin to be serious If you cant help laughin dont look at me or
Ill go pop

I see All right said Stalky

McTurks lank frame stiffened in every muscle and his eyelids dropped
half over his eyes That last was a warsignal

The eight or nine seniors their faces very set and sober were ranged
in chairs round Carsons severely Philistine study Tulke was not
popular among them and a few who had had experience of Stalky and
Company doubted that he might perhaps have made an ass of himself But
the dignity of the Sixth was to be upheld So Carson began hurriedly
Look here you chaps Iveweve sent for you to tell you youre a
good deal too cheeky to the Sixthhave been for some timeandand
weve stood about as much as were goin to and it seems youve been
cursin and swearin at Tulke on the Bideford road this afternoon and
were goin to show you you cant do it Thats all

Well thats awfully good of you said Stalky but we happen to have
a few rights of our own too You cant just because you happen to
be made prefects haul up seniors and jaw em on spec like a
housemaster We arent fags Carson This kind of thing may do for
Davies Tertius but it wont do for us

Its only old Prouts lunacy that we werent prefects long ago You
know that said McTurk You havent any tact

Hold on said Beetle A prefects meetin has to be reported to the
Head I want to know if the Head backs Tulke in this business

Wellwell it isnt exactly a prefects meeting said Carson We
only called you in to warn you

But all the prefects are here Beetle insisted Wheres the
difference

My Gum said Stalky Do you mean to say youve just called us in for
a jawafter comin to us before the whole school at tea an givin em
the impression it was a prefects meeting Pon my Sam Carson youll
get into trouble you will

Holeancorner businessholeancorner business said McTurk
wagging his head Beastly suspicious

The Sixth looked at each other uneasily Tulke had called three
prefects meetings in two terms till the Head had informed the Sixth
that they were expected to maintain discipline without the recurrent
menace of his authority Now it seemed that they had made a blunder at
the outset but any rightminded boy would have sunk the legality and
been properly impressed by the Court Beetles protest was distinct
cheek

Well you chaps deserve a lickin cried one Naughten incautiously
Then was Beetle filled with a noble inspiration

For interferin with Tulkes amours eh Tulke turned a rich sloe
color Oh no you dont Beetle went on Youve had your innings
Weve been sent up for cursing and swearing at you and were goin to
be let off with a warning _Are_ we Now then youre going to catch
it

III Tulke began Dont let that young devil start jawing

If youve anything to say you must say it decently said Carson

Decently I will Now look here When we went into Bideford we met this
ornament of the Sixthis that decent enoughhanging about on the
road with a nasty look in his eye We didnt know _then_ why he was so
anxious to stop us _but_ at five minutes to four when we were in Yeos
shop we saw Tulke in broad daylight with his housecap on kissin an
huggin a woman on the pavement Is that decent enough for you

I didntI wasnt

We saw you said Beetle And nowIll be decent Carsonyou sneak
back with her kisses not for nothing had Beetle perused the later
poets hot on your lips and call prefects meetings which arent
prefects meetings to uphold the honor of the Sixth A new and
heavencleft path opened before him that instant And how do we know
 he shoutedhow do we know how many of the Sixth are mixed up in this
abominable affair

Yes thats what we want to know said McTurk with simple dignity

We meant to come to you about it quietly Carson but you would have
the meeting said Stalky sympathetically

The Sixth were too taken aback to reply So carefully modelling
his rhetoric on King Beetle followed up the attack surpassing and
surprising himself Itit isnt so much the cynical immorality of the
biznai as the blatant indecency of it thats so awful As far as we
can see its impossible for us to go into Bideford without runnin up
against some prefects unwholesome amours Theres nothing to snigger
over Naughten I dont pretend to know much about these thingsbut it
seems to me a chap must be pretty far dead in sin that was a quotation
from the school chaplain when he takes to embracing his paramours
 that was Hakluyt before all the city a reminiscence of Milton
He might at least have the decencyyoure authorities on decency
I believeto wait till dark But he didnt You didnt Oh Tulke
Youyou incontinent little animal

Here shut up a minute Whats all this about Tulke said Carson

Ilook here Im awfully sorry I never thought Beetle would take this
line

Becauseyouveno decencyyouthoughtI hadnt cried Beetle all
in one breath

Tried to cover it all up with a conspiracy did you said Stalky

Direct insult to all three of us said McTurk A most filthy mind you
have Tulke

Ill shove you fellows outside the door if you go on like this said
Carson angrily

That proves its a conspiracy said Stalky with the air of a virgin
martyr

II was goin along the streetI swear I was cried Tulke andand
Im awfully sorry about ita woman came up and kissed me I swear I
didnt kiss her

There was a pause filled by Stalkys long liquid whistle of contempt
amazement and derision

On my honor gulped the persecuted one Oh do stop him jawing

Very good McTurk interjected We are compelled of course to accept
your statement

Confound it roared Naughten You arent headprefect here McTurk

Oh well returned the Irishman you know Tulke better than we do I
am only speaking for ourselves _We_ accept Tulkes word But all I can
say is that if Id been collared in a similarly disgustin situation
and had offered the same explanation Tulke has II wonder what youd
have said However it seems on Tulkes word of honor

And Tulkusbeg pardon_kiss_ of courseTulkiss is an honorable
man put in Stalky

that the Sixth cant protect emselves from bein kissed when they
go for a walk cried Beetle taking up the running with a rush Sweet
business isnt it Cheerful thing to tell the fags aint it We arent
prefects of course but we arent kissed very much Dont think that
sort of thing ever enters our heads does it Stalky

Oh no said Stalky turning aside to hide his emotions McTurks face
merely expressed lofty contempt and a little weariness

Well you seem to know a lot about it interposed a prefect

Cant help itwhen you chaps shove it under our noses Beetle dropped
into a drawling parody of Kings most biting colloquial stylethe
gentle rain after the thunderstorm Well its all very sufficiently
vile and disgraceful isnt it I dont know who comes out of it
worst Tulke who happens to have been caught or the other fellows who
havent And we here he wheeled fiercely on the other twoweve
got to stand up and be jawed by them because weve disturbed their
intrigues

Hang it I only wanted to give you a word of warning said Carson
thereby handing himself bound to the enemy

Warn You This with the air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his
locker Carson would you be good enough to tell us what conceivable
thing there is that you are entitled to warn us about after this
exposure Warn Oh its a little too much Lets go somewhere where
its clean

The door banged behind their outraged innocence

Oh Beetle Beetle Beetle Golden Beetle sobbed Stalky hurling
himself on Beetles panting bosom as soon as they reached the study
However did you do it

Dearr man said McTurk embracing Beetles head with both arms while
he swayed it to and fro on the neck in time to this ancient burden

 Pretty lipssweeter thancherry or plum
 Always lookjolly andnever look glum
 Seem to sayCome away Kissycome come
 Yummyyum Yummyyum Yummyyumyum

Look out Youll smash my giglamps puffed Beetle emerging Wasnt
it glorious Didnt I Eric em splendidly Did you spot my cribs
from King Oh blow His countenance clouded Theres one adjective
I didnt useobscene Dont know how I forgot that Its one of Kings
pet ones too

Never mind Theyll be sendin ambassadors round in half a shake to
beg us not to tell the school Its a deuced serious business for them
 said McTurk Poor Sixthpoor old Sixth

Immoral young rips Stalky snorted What an example to puresouled
boys like you and me

And the Sixth in Carsons study sat aghast glowering at Tulke who was
on the edge of tears Well said the headprefect acidly Youve made
a pretty average ghastly mess of it Tulke

Whywhy didnt you lick that young devil Beetle before he began
jawing Tulke wailed

I knew thered be a row said a prefect of Prouts house But you
would insist on the meeting Tulke

Yes and a fat lot of good its done us said Naughten They come in
here and jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin them Beetle talks
to us as if we were a lot of blackguards andand all that And
when theyve hung us up to dry they go out and slam the door like a
housemaster All your fault Tulke

But I didnt kiss her

You ass If youd said you _had_ and stuck to it it would have been
ten times better than what you did Naughten retorted Now theyll
tell the whole schooland Beetlell make up a lot of beastly rhymes and
nicknames

But hang it she kissed me Outside of his work Tulkes mind moved
slowly

Im not thinking of you Im thinking of us Ill go up to their study
and see if I can make em keep quiet

Tulkes awfly cut up about this business Naughten began
ingratiatingly when he found Beetle

Whos kissed him this time

and Ive come to ask you chaps and especially you Beetle not to
let the thing be known all over the school Of course fellows as senior
as you are can easily see why

Um said Beetle with the cold reluctance of one who foresees an
unpleasant public duty I suppose I must go and talk to the Sixth
again

Not the least need my dear chap I assure you said Naughten hastily
Ill take any message you care to send

But the chance of supplying the missing adjective was too tempting So
Naughten returned to that still undissolved meeting Beetle white icy
and aloof at his heels

There seems he began with laboriously crisp articulation there
seems to be a certain amount of uneasiness among you as to the steps
we may think fit to take in regard to this last revelation of
theahobscene If it is any consolation to you to know that we have
decidedfor the honor of the school you understandto keep our mouths
shut as to theseahobscenities youahhave it

He wheeled his head among the stars and strode statelily back to his
study where Stalky and McTurk lay side by side upon the table wiping
their tearful eyestoo weak to move


The Latin prose paper was a success beyond their wildest dreams
Stalky and McTurk were of course out of all examinations they did
extratuition with the Head but Beetle attended with zeal

This I presume is a parergon on your part said King as he dealt
out the papers One final exhibition ere you are translated to loftier
spheres A last attack on the classics It seems to confound you
already

Beetle studied the print with knit brows I cant make head or tail of
it he murmured What does it mean

No no said King with scholastic coquetry We depend upon you
to give us the meaning This is an examination Beetle mine not a
guessingcompetition You will find your associates have no difficulty
in

Tulke left his place and laid the paper on the desk King looked read
and turned a ghastly green

Stalkys missing a heap thought Beetle Wonder how Kingll get out
of it

There seems King began with a gulp a certain modicum of truth
in our Beetles remark I amerinclined to believe that the worthy
Randall must have dropped this in feruleif you know what that means
Beetle you purport to be an editor Perhaps you can enlighten the form
as to formes

What sir Whose form I dont see that theres any verb in this
sentence at all ananthe Ode is all different somehow

I was about to say before you volunteered your criticism that an
accident must have befallen the paper in type and that the printer
reset it by the light of nature No he held the thing at arms
lengthour Randall is not an authority on Cicero or Horace

Rather mean to shove it off on Randall whispered Beetle to his
neighbor King must ha been as screwed as an owl when he wrote it
out

But we can amend the error by dictating it

No sir The answer came pat from a dozen throats at once That cuts
the time for the exam Only two hours allowed sir Tisnt fair Its
a printedpaper exam Howre we goin to be marked for it Its all
Randalls fault It isnt our fault anyhow An exams an exam etc
etc

Naturally Mr King considered this was an attempt to undermine his
authority and instead of beginning dictation at once delivered a
lecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached As the
storm subsided Beetle fanned it afresh

Eh What What was that you were saying to MacLagan

I only said I thought the papers ought to have been looked at before
they were given out sir

Hear hear from a back bench Mr King wished to know whether Beetle
took it upon himself personally to conduct the traditions of the school
His zeal for knowledge ate up another fifteen minutes during which the
prefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom

Oh it was a giddy time said Beetle afterwards in dismantled Number
Five He gibbered a bit and I kept him on the gibber and then he
dictated about a half of Dolabella  Co

Good old Dolabella Friend of mine Yes said Stalky pensively

Then we had to ask him how every other word was spelt of course and
he gibbered a lot more He cursed me and MacLagan Mac played up like a
trump and Randall and the materialized ignorance of the unscholarly
middle classes lust for mere marks and all the rest It was what
you might call a final exhibitiona last attacka giddy parergon

But o course he was blind squiffy when he wrote the paper I hope you
explained that said Stalky

Oh yes I told Tulke so I said an immoral prefect an a drunken
housemaster were legitimate inferences Tulke nearly blubbed Hes
awfully shy of us since Marys time

Tulke preserved that modesty till the last momenttill the
journeymoney had been paid and the boys were filling the brakes that
took them to the station Then the three tenderly constrained him to
wait a while

You see Tulke you may be a prefect said Stalky but Ive left the
Coll Do you see Tulke dear

Yes I see Dont bear malice Stalky

Stalky Curse your impudence you young cub shouted Stalky
magnificent in tophat stiff collar spats and highwaisted
snuffcolored ulster I want you to understand that _Im_ Mister
Corkran an youre a dirty little schoolboy

Besides bein frabjously immoral said McTurk Wonder you arent
ashamed to foist your company on pureminded boys like us

Come on Tulke cried Naughten from the prefects brake

Yes were comin Shove up and make room you Collegers Youve all
got to be back next term with your Yes sir and Oh sir an No
sir an Please sir but before we say goodby were going to tell you
a little story Go on Dickie this to the driver were quite ready
Kick that hatbox under the seat an dont crowd your Uncle Stalky

As nice a lot of highminded youngsters as youd wish to see said
McTurk gazing round with bland patronage A trifle immoral but
thenboys will be boys Its no good tryin to look stuffy Carson
_Mister_ Corkran will now oblige with the story of Tulke an Mary Yeo




SLAVES OF THE LAMP

Part II


That very Infant who told the story of the capture of Boh Na Ghee
_A Conference_ _of the Powers_ Many Inventions to Eustace Cleaver
novelist inherited an estateful baronetcy with vast revenues resigned
the service and became a landholder while his mother stood guard over
him to see that he married the right girl But new to his position he
presented the local volunteers with a fullsized magazinerifle range
two miles long across the heart of his estate and the surrounding
families who lived in savage seclusion among woods full of pheasants
regarded him as an erring maniac The noise of the firing disturbed
their poultry and Infant was cast out from the society of JPs and
decent men till such time as a daughter of the county might lure him
back to right thinking He took his revenge by filling the house
with choice selections of old schoolmates home on leaveaffable
detrimentals at whom the bicycleriding maidens of the surrounding
families were allowed to look from afar I knew when a troopship was in
port by the Infants invitations Sometimes he would produce old friends
of equal seniority at others young and blushing giants whom I had left
small fags far down in the Lower Second and to these Infant and the
elders expounded the whole duty of man in the Army

Ive had to cut the service said the Infant but thats no reason
why my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity He was
just thirty and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his
baronial castle Got good haul ex _Tamar_ Come along

It was an unusually good haul arranged with a single eye to my benefit
There was a baldish brokendown captain of Native Infantry shivering
with ague behind an indomitable red noseand they called him Captain
Dickson There was another captain also of Native Infantry with a fair
mustache his face was like white glass and his hands were fragile but
he answered joyfully to the cry of Tertius There was an enormously
big and wellkept man who had evidently not campaigned for years
cleanshaved softvoiced and catlike but still Abanazar for all that
he adorned the Indian Political Service and there was a lean Irishman
his face tanned blueblack with the suns of the Telegraph Department
Luckily the baize doors of the bachelors wing fitted tight for we
dressed promiscuously in the corridor or in each others rooms talking
calling shouting and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of Dick Fours
own devising

There were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us
and since we had met one another from time to time in the quick
sceneshifting of Indiaa dinner camp or a racemeeting here a
dakbungalow or railway station up country somewhere elsewe had never
quite lost touch Infant sat on the banisters hungrily and enviously
drinking it in He enjoyed his baronetcy but his heart yearned for the
old days

It was a cheerful babel of matters personal provincial and imperial
pieces of old callover lists and new policies cut short by the roar
of a Burmese gong and we went down not less than a quarter of a mile of
stairs to meet Infants mother who had known us all in our schooldays
and greeted us as if those had ended a week ago But it was
fifteen years since with tears of laughter she had lent me a gray
princessskirt for amateur theatricals

That was a dinner from the Arabian Nights served in an eightyfoot
hall full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses and what was more
impressive heated by steam When it was ended and the little mother had
gone awayYou boys want to talk so I shall say goodnight nowwe
gathered about an applewood fire in a gigantic polished steel grate
under a mantelpiece ten feet high and the Infant compassed us about
with curious liqueurs and that kind of cigarette which serves best to
introduce your own pipe

Oh bliss grunted Dick Four from a sofa where he had been packed
with a rug over him First time Ive been warm since I came home

We were all nearly on top of the fire except Infant who had been long
enough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled This is a grisly
diversion but much affected by the English of the Island

If you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks drawled McTurk
Ill kill you Infant Ive got a liver too Member when we used
to think it a treat to turn out of our beds on a Sunday
morningthermometer fiftyseven degrees if it was summerand bathe off
the Pebbleridge Ugh

Thing I dont understand said Tertius was the way we chaps used to
go down into the lavatories boil ourselves pink and then come up with
all our pores open into a young snowstorm or a black frost Yet none of
our chaps died that I can remember

Talkin of baths said McTurk with a chuckle member our bath in
Number Five Beetle the night RabbitsEggs rocked King What wouldnt
I give to see old Stalky now He is the only one of the two Studies not
here

Stalky is the great man of his Century said Dick Four

How dyou know I asked

How do I know said Dick Four scornfully If youve ever been in a
tight place with Stalky you wouldnt ask

I havent seen him since the camp at Pindi in 87 I said He was
goin strong thenabout seven feet high and four feet through

Adequate chap Infernally adequate said Tertius pulling his mustache
and staring into the fire

Got dam near courtmartialed and broke in Egypt in 84 the Infant
volunteered I went out in the same trooper with himas raw as he was
Only _I_ showed it and Stalky didnt

What was the trouble said McTurk reaching forward absently to twitch
my dresstie into position

Oh nothing His colonel trusted him to take twenty Tommies out to
wash or groom camels or something at the back of Suakin and Stalky
got embroiled with Fuzzies five miles in the interior He conducted a
masterly retreat and wiped up eight of em He knew jolly well hed
no right to go out so far so he took the initiative and pitched in a
letter to his colonel who was frothing at the mouth complaining of the
paucity of support accorded to him in his operations Gad it might
have been one fat brigadier slangin another Then he went into the
Staff Corps

ThatisentirelyStalky said Abanazar from his armchair

Youve come across him too I said

Oh yes he replied in his softest tones I was at the tail of
thatthat epic Dont you chaps know

We did notInfant McTurk and I and we called for information very
politely

Twasnt anything said Tertius We got into a mess up in the
KhyeKheen Hills a couple o years ago and Stalky pulled us through
Thats all

McTurk gazed at Tertius with all an Irishmans contempt for the
tonguetied Saxon

Heavens he said And its you and your likes govern Ireland
Tertius arent you ashamed

Well I cant tell a yarn I can chip in when the other fellow starts
_bukhing_ Ask him He pointed to Dick Four whose nose gleamed
scornfully over the rug

I knew you wouldnt said Dick Four Give me a whiskey and soda Ive
been drinking lemonsquash and ammoniated quinine while you chaps were
bathin in champagne and my heads singin like a top

He wiped his ragged mustache above the drink and his teeth chattering
in his head began You know the KhyeKheenMalot expedition when
we scared the souls out of em with a field force they darent fight
against Well both tribesthere was a coalition against uscame in
without firing a shot and a lot of hairy villains who had no more
power over their men than I had promised and vowed all sorts of things
On that very slender evidence Pussy dear

I was at Simla said Abanazar hastily

Never mind youre tarred with the same brush On the strength of
those tuppennyhapenny treaties your asses of Politicals reported the
country as pacified and the Government being a fool as usual began
roadmakindependin on local supply for labor Member _that_ Pussy
Rest of our chaps whod had no lookin during the campaign didnt think
thered be any more of it and were anxious to get back to India But
Id been in two of these little rows before and I had my suspicions
I engineered myself _summa ingenio_ into command of a roadpatrolno
shovellin only marching up and down genteelly with a guard Theyd
withdrawn all the troops they could but I nucleused about forty
Pathans recruits chiefly of my regiment and sat tight at the
basecamp while the roadparties went to work as per Political survey

Had some rippin singsongs in camp too said Tertius

My pupthus did Dick Four refer to his subalternwas a pious
little beast He didnt like the singsongs and so he went down with
pneumonia I rootled round the camp and found Tertius gassing about as
a DAQMG which God knows he isnt cut out for There were six
or eight of the old Coll at basecamp were always in force for a
frontier row but Id heard of Tertius as a steady old hack and I told
him he had to shake off his DAQMG breeches and help _me_ Tertius
volunteered like a shot and we settled it with the authorities and out
we wentforty Pathans Tertius and me looking up the roadparties
Macnamarasmember old Mac the Sapper who played the fiddle so
damnably at UmballaMacs party was the last but one The last was
Stalkys He was at the head of the road with some of his pet Sikhs Mac
said he believed he was all right

Stalky _is_ a Sikh said Tertius He takes his men to pray at the
Durbar Sahib at Amritzar regularly as clockwork when he can

Dont interrupt Tertius It was about forty miles beyond Macs before
I found him and my men pointed out gently but firmly that the country
was risin What kind o country Beetle Well _I_m no wordpainter
thank goodness but _you_ might call it a hellish country When we
werent up to our necks in snow we were rolling down the khud The
welldisposed inhabitants who were to supply labor for the roadmaking
dont forget that Pussy dear sat behind rocks and took potshots
at us Old old story We all legged it in search of Stalky I had a
feeling that hed be in good cover and about dusk we found him and his
roadparty as snug as a bug in a rug in an old Malot stone fort with
a watchtower at one corner It overhung the road they had blasted
out of the cliff fifty feet below and under the road things went down
pretty sheer for five or six hundred feet into a gorge about half a
mile wide and two or three miles long There were chaps on the other
side of the gorge scientifically gettin our range So I hammered on
the gate and nipped in and tripped over Stalky in a greasy bloody old
poshteen squatting on the ground eating with his men Id only seen
him for half a minute about three months before but I might have met
him yesterday He waved his hand all sereno

Hullo Aladdin Hullo Emperor he said Youre just in time for the
performance

I saw his Sikhs looked a bit battered Wheres your command Wheres
your subaltern I said

Hereall there is of it said Stalky If you want young Everett
hes dead and his bodys in the watchtower They rushed our roadparty
last week and got him and seven men Weve been besieged for five days
I suppose they let you through to make sure of you The whole countrys
up Strikes me youve walked into a firstclass trap He grinned but
neither Tertius nor I could see where the deuce the fun was We hadnt
any grub for our men and Stalky had only four days whack for his That
came of dependin upon your asinine Politicals Pussy dear who told us
that the inhabitants were friendly

To make us _quite_ comfy Stalky took us up to the watchtower to see
poor Everetts body lyin in a foot o drifted snow It looked like a
girl of fifteennot a hair on the little fellows face Hed been shot
through the temple but the Malots had left their mark on him Stalky
unbuttoned the tunic and showed it to usa rummy sickleshaped cut on
the chest Member the snow all white on his eyebrows Tertius Member
when Stalky moved the lamp and it looked as if he was alive

Yees said Tertius with a shudder Member the beastly look on
Stalkys face though with his nostrils all blown out same as he used
to look when he was bullyin a fag That was a lovely evening

We held a council of war up there over Everetts body Stalky said the
Malots and KhyeKheens were up together havin sunk their blood feuds
to settle us The chaps wed seen across the gorge were KhyeKheens It
was about half a mile from them to us as a bullet flies and theyd made
a line of sungars under the brow of the hill to sleep in and starve us
out The Malots he said were in front of us promiscuous There wasnt
good cover behind the fort or theyd have been there too Stalky
didnt mind the Malots half as much as he did the KhyeKheens He said
the Malots were treacherous curs What I couldnt understand was why
in the world the two gangs didnt join in and rush us There must have
been at least five hundred of em Stalky said they didnt trust each
other very well because they were ancestral enemies when they were
at home and the only time theyd tried a rush hed hove a couple of
blastingcharges among em and that had sickened em a bit

It was dark by the time we finished and Stalky always serene said
You command now I dont suppose you mind my taking any action I may
consider necessary to reprovision the fort I said Of course not
and then the lamp blew out So Tertius and I had to climb down the tower
steps we didnt want to stay with Everett and got back to our men
Stalky had gone offto count the stores I supposed Anyhow Tertius
and I sat up in case of a rush they were plugging at us pretty
generally you know relieving each other till the mornin

Mornin came No Stalky Not a sign of him I took counsel with his
senior native officera grand whitewhiskered old chapRutton Singh
from Jullunderway He only grinned and said it was all right Stalky
had been out of the fort twice before somewhere or other accordin to
him He said Stalky ud come back unchipped and gave me to understand
that Stalky was an invulnerable _Guru_ of sorts All the same I put the
whole command on half rations and set em to pickin out loopholes

About noon there was no end of a snowstorm and the enemy stopped
firing We replied gingerly because we were awfully short of
ammunition Dont suppose we fired five shots an hour but we generally
got our man Well while I was talking with Rutton Singh I saw Stalky
coming down from the watchtower rather puffy about the eyes his
poshteen coated with claretcolored ice

No trustin these snowstorms he said Nip out quick and snaffle
what you can get Theres a certain amount of friction between the
KhyeKheens and the Malots just now

I turned Tertius out with twenty Pathans and they bucked about in the
snow for a bit till they came on to a sort of camp about eight hundred
yards away with only a few men in charge and half a dozen sheep by
the fire They finished off the men and snaffled the sheep and as much
grain as they could carry and came back No one fired a shot at em
There didnt seem to be anybody about but the snow was falling pretty
thick

Thats good enough said Stalky when we got dinner ready and he was
chewin muttonkababs off a cleanin rod Theres no sense riskin men
Theyre holding a powwow between the KhyeKheens and the Malots at
the head of the gorge I dont think these socalled coalitions are much
good

Do you know what that maniac had done Tertius and I shook it out of
him by instalments There was an underground granary cellarroom below
the watchtower and in blasting the road Stalky had blown a hole into
one side of it Being no one else _but_ Stalky hed kept the hole open
for his own ends and laid poor Everetts body slap over the well of the
stairs that led down to it from the watchtower Hed had to move and
replace the corpse every time he used the passage The Sikhs wouldnt go
near the place of course Well hed got out of this hole and dropped
on to the road Then in the night _and_ a howling snowstorm hed
dropped over the edge of the khud made his way down to the bottom of
the gorge forded the nullah which was half frozen climbed up on the
other side along a track hed discovered and come out on the right
flank of the KhyeKheens He had thenlisten to thiscrossed over a
ridge that paralleled their rear walked half a mile behind that and
come out on the left of their line where the gorge gets shallow and
where there was a regular track between the Malot and the KhyeKheen
camps That was about two in the morning and as it turned out a man
spotted hima KhyeKheen So Stalky abolished him quietly and left
him_with_ the Malot mark on his chest same as Everett had

I was just as economical as I could be Stalky said to us If hed
shouted I should have been slain Id never had to do that kind of thing
but once before and that was the first time I tried that path Its
perfectly practicable for infantry you know

What about your first man I said

Oh that was the night after they killed Everett and I went out
lookin for a line of retreat for my men A man found me I abolished
him_privatim_scragged him But on thinkin it over it occurred to
me that if I could find the body Id hove it down some rocks I might
decorate it with the Malot mark and leave it to the KhyeKheens to draw
inferences So I went out again the next night and did The KhyeKheens
are shocked at the Malots perpetratin these two dastardly outrages
after theyd sworn to sink all bleed feuds I lay up behind their
sungars early this morning and watched em They all went to confer
about it at the head of the gorge Awfly annoyed they are Dont
wonder You know the way Stalky drops out his words one by one

My God said the Infant explosively as the full depth of the
strategy dawned on him

Dearr man said McTurk purring rapturously

Stalky stalked said Tertius Thats all there is to it

No he didnt said Dick Four Dont you remember how he insisted
that he had only applied his luck Dont you remember how Rutton Singh
grabbed his boots and grovelled in the snow and how our men shouted

None of our Pathans believed that was luck said Tertius They swore
Stalky ought to have been born a Pathan andmember we nearly had a
row in the fort when Rutton Singh said Stalky was a Pathan Gad how
furious the old chap was with my Jemadar But Stalky just waggled his
finger and they shut up

Old Rutton Singhs sword was half out though and he swore hed
cremate every KhyeKheen and Malot he killed That made the Jemadar
pretty wild because he didnt mind fighting against his own creed but
he wasnt going to crab a fellow Mussulmans chances of Paradise Then
Stalky jabbered Pushtu and Punjabi in alternate streaks Where the deuce
did he pick up his Pushtu from Beetle

Never mind his language Dick said I Give us the gist of it

I flatter myself I can address the wily Pathan on occasion but hang
it all I cant make puns in Pushtu or top off my arguments with a
smutty story as he did He played on those two old dogs o war like
alike a concertina Stalky saidand the other two backed up his
knowledge of Oriental naturethat the KhyeKheens and the Malots
between em would organize a combined attack on us that night as
a proof of good faith They wouldnt drive it home though because
neither side would trust the other on account as Rutton Singh put it
of the little accidents Stalkys notion was to crawl out at dusk with
his Sikhs manoeuvre em along this ungodly goattrack that hed found
to the back of the KhyeKheen position and then lob in a few long shots
at the Malots when the attack was well on Thatll divert their minds
and help to agitate em he said Then you chaps can come out and
sweep up the pieces and well rendezvous at the head of the gorge
After that I move we get back to Macs camp and have something to eat

_You_ were commandin the Infant suggested

I was about three months senior to Stalky and two months Tertiuss
senior Dick Four replied _But_ we were all from the same old Coll
I should say ours was the only little affair on record where some one
wasnt jealous of some one else

_We_ werent Tertius broke in but there was another row between Gul
Sher Khan and Rutton Singh Our Jemadar saidhe was quite rightthat
no Sikh living could stalk worth a damn and that Koran Sahib had better
take out the Pathans who understood that kind of mountain work Rutton
Singh said that Koran Sahib jolly well knew every Pathan was a born
deserter and every Sikh was a gentleman even if he couldnt crawl on
his belly Stalky struck in with some womans proverb or other that had
the effect of doublin both men up with a grin He said the Sikhs and
the Pathans could settle their claims on the KhyeKheens and
Malots later on but he was going to take his Sikhs along for this
mountainclimbing job because Sikhs could shoot They can too Give
em a muleload of ammunition apiece and theyre perfectly happy

And out he gat said Dick Four As soon as it was dark and hed had
a bit of a snooze him and thirty Sikhs went down through the staircase
in the tower every mothers son of em salutin little Everett where
It stood propped up against the wall The last I heard him say was
Kubbadar tumbleinga Look out youll fall and they tumbleingaed
over the black edge of nothing Close upon 9 pm the combined attack
developed KhyeKheens across the valley and Malots in front of us
pluggin at long range and yellin to each other to come along and cut
our infidel throats Then they skirmished up to the gate and began the
old game of calling our Pathans renegades and invitin em to join the
holy war One of our men a young fellow from Dera Ismail jumped on
the wall to slang em back and jumped down blubbing like a child Hed
been hit smack in the middle of the hand Never saw a man yet who could
stand a hit in the hand without weepin bitterly It tickles up all the
nerves So Tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to
keep them quiet at the loopholes The dear children wanted to open the
gate and go in at em generally but that didnt suit our book

At last near midnight I heard the wop wop wop of Stalkys Martinis
across the valley and some general cursing among the Malots whose
main body was hid from us by a fold in the hillside Stalky was brownin
em at a great rate and very naturally they turned half right and began
to blaze at their faithless allies the KhyeKheensregular volley
firin In less than ten minutes after Stalky opened the diversion they
were going it hammer and tongs both sides the valley When we could
see the valley was rather a mixedup affair The KhyeKheens had
streamed out of their sungars above the gorge to chastise the Malots
and StalkyI was watching him through my glasseshad slipped in behind
em Very good The KhyeKheens had to leg it along the hillside up to
where the gorge got shallow and they could cross over to the Malots
who were awfully cheered to see the KhyeKheens taken in the rear

Then it occurred to me to comfort the KhyeKheens So I turned out the
whole command and we advanced _a la pas de charge_ doublin up what
for the sake of argument well call the Malots left flank Even then
if theyd sunk their differences they could have eaten us alive
but theyd been firin at each other half the night and they went on
firin Queerest thing you ever saw in your born days As soon as our
men doubled up to the Malots theyd blaze at the KhyeKheens more
zealously than ever to show they were on our side run up the valley
a few hundred yards and halt to fire again The moment Stalky saw our
game he duplicated it his side the gorge and by Jove the KhyeKheens
did just the same thing

Yes but said Tertius youve forgot him playin Arrah Patsy mind
the baby on the bugle to hurry us up

Did he roared McTurk Somehow we all began to sing it and there was
an interruption

Rather said Tertius when we were quiet No one of the Aladdin
company could forget that tune Yes he played Patsy Go on Dick

Finally said Dick Four we drove both mobs into each others arms on
a bit of level ground at the head of the valley and saw the whole crew
whirl off fightin and stabbin and swearin in a blindin snowstorm
They were a heavy hairy lot and we didnt follow em

Stalky had captured one prisoneran old pensioned Sepoy of twentyfive
years service who produced his dischargean awfly sportin old card
He had been tryin to make his men rush us early in the day He was
sulkyangry with his own side for their cowardice and Rutton Singh
wanted to bayonet himSikhs dont understand fightin against the
Government after youve served it honestlybut Stalky rescued him and
froze on to him tightwith ulterior motives I believe When we got
back to the fort we buried young EverettStalky wouldnt hear of
blowin up the placeand bunked Wed only lost ten men all told

Only ten out of seventy How did you lose em I asked

Oh there was a rush on the fort early in the night and a few Malots
got over the gate It was rather a tight thing for a minute or two but
the recruits took it beautifully Lucky job we hadnt any badly wounded
men to carry because we had forty miles to Macnamaras camp By Jove
how we legged it Half way in old Rutton Singh collapsed so we slung
him across four rifles and Stalkys overcoat and Stalky his prisoner
and a couple of Sikhs were his bearers After that I went to sleep You
can you know on the march when your legs get properly numbed Mac
swears we all marched into his camp snoring and dropped where we halted
His men lugged us into the tents like grambags I remember wakin up
and seeing Stalky asleep with his head on old Rutton Singhs chest _He_
slept twentyfour hours I only slept seventeen but then I was coming
down with dysentery

Coming down What rot He had it on him before we joined Stalky in the
fort said Tertius

Well _you_ neednt talk You hove your sword at Macnamara and demanded
a drumhead courtmartial every time you saw him The only thing that
soothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour You were off
your head for three days

Dont remember a word of it said Tertius placidly I remember my
orderly giving me milk though

How did Stalky come out McTurk demanded purling hard over his pipe

Stalky Like a serene Brahmini bull Poor old Mac was at his Royal
Engineers wits end to know what to do You see I was putrid with
dysentery Tertius was ravin half the men had frostbite and
Macnamaras orders were to break camp and come in before winter So
Stalky who hadnt turned a hair took half his supplies to save him
the bother o luggin em back to the plains and all the ammunition he
could get at and _consilio et auxilio_ Rutton Singhi tramped back
to his fort with all his Sikhs and his precious prisoners and a lot of
dissolute hangerson that he and the prisoner had seduced into service
He had sixty men of sortsand his brazen cheek Mac nearly wept with
joy when he went You see there werent any explicit orders to Stalky to
come in before the passes were blocked Mac is a great man for orders
and Stalkys a great man for orderswhen they suit his book

He told me he was goin to the Engadine said Tertius Sat on my cot
smokin a cigarette and makin me laugh till I cried Macnamara bundled
the whole lot of us down to the plains next day We were a walkin
hospital

Stalky told me that Macnamara was a simple godsend to him said Dick
Four I used to see him in Macs tent listenin to Mac playin the
fiddle and between the pieces wheedlin Mac out of picks and shovels
and dynamite cartridges handoverfist Well that was the last we saw
of Stalky A week or so later the passes were shut with snow and I
dont think Stalky wanted to be found particularly just then

He didnt said the fair and fat Abanazar He didnt Ho ho

Dick Four threw up his thin dry hand with the blue veins at the back of
it Hold on a minute Pussy Ill let you in at the proper time I went
down to my regiment and that spring five mouths later I got off
with a couple of companies on detachment nominally to look after some
friends of ours across the border actually of course to recruit
It was a bit unfortunate because an ass of a young Naick carried a
frivolous bloodfeud hed inherited from his aunt into those hills and
the local gentry wouldnt volunteer into my corps Of course the Naick
had taken short leave to manage the business that was all regular
enough _but_ hed stalked my pet orderlys uncle It was an infernal
shame because I knew Harris of the Ghuznees would be covering that
ground three months later and hed snaffle all the chaps I had my eyes
on Everybody was down on the Naick because they felt he ought to
have had the decency to postpone hishis disgustful amours till our
companies were full strength

Still the beast had a certain amount of professional feeling left
He sent one of his aunts clan by night to tell me that if Id take
safeguard hed put me on to a batch of beauties I nipped over the
border like a shot and about ten miles the other side in a nullah
my rappareeincharge showed me about seventy men variously armed but
standing up like a Queens company Then one of em stepped out and
lugged round an old bugle just likewhos the manBancroft aint
itfeeling for his eyeglass in a farce and played Arrah Patsy
mind the baby Arrah Patsy mindthat was as for as he could get

That also was as far as Dick Four could get because we had to sing
the old song through twice again and once more and subsequently in
order to repeat it

He explained that if I knew the rest of the song he had a note for me
from the man the song belonged to Whereupon my children I finished
that old tune on that bugle and _this_ is what I got I knew youd like
to look at it Dont grab We were all struggling for a sight of the
wellknown unformed handwriting Ill read it aloud

 Fort Everett February 19

Dear Dick or Tertius The bearer of this is in charge of seventyfive
recruits all pukka devils but desirous of leading new lives They have
been slightly polished and after being boiled may shape well I want
you to give thirty of them to my adjutant who though Gods own ass
will need men this spring The rest you can keep You will be interested
to learn that I have extended my road to the end of the Malot country
All headmen and priests concerned in last Septembers affair worked one
month each supplying road metal from their own houses Everetts grave
is covered by a fortyfoot mound which should serve well as a base for
future triangulations Rutton Singh sends his best salaams I am
making some treaties and have given my prisonerwho also sends his
salaamslocal rank of Khan Bahadur A L Cockran

Well that was all said Dick Four when the roaring the shouting
the laughter and I think the tears had subsided I chaperoned the
gang across the border as quick as I could They were rather homesick
but they cheered up when they recognized some of my chaps who had been
in the KhyeKheen row and they made a rippin good lot Its rather
more than three hundred miles from Fort Everett to where I picked em
up Now Pussy tell em the latter end o Stalky as you saw it

Abanazar laughed a little nervous misleading official laugh

Oh it wasnt much I was at Simla in the spring when our Stalky out
of his snows began corresponding direct with the Government

After the manner of a king suggested Dick Four My turn now
Dick Hed done a whole let of things he shouldnt have done and
constructively pledged the Government to all sorts of action

Pledged the States ticker eh said McTurk with a nod to me

About that but the embarrassin part was that it was all so thunderin
convenient so well reasoned dont you know Came in as pat as if hed
had access to all sorts of informationwhich he couldnt of course

Pooh said Tertius I back Stalky against the Foreign Office any
day

Hed done pretty nearly everything he could think of except strikin
coins in his own image and superscription all under cover of buildin
this infernal road and bein blocked by the snow His report was simply
amazin Von Lennaert tore his hair over it at first and then he
gasped Who the dooce is this unknown Warren Hastings He must be
slain He must be slain officially The Viceroyll never stand it Its
unheard of He must be slain by his Excellency in person Order him up
here and pitch in a stinger Well I sent him no end of an official
stinger and I pitched in an unofficial telegram at the same time

You This with amazement from the Infant for Abanazar resembled
nothing so much as a fluffy Persian cat

Yesme said Abanazar Twasnt much but after what youve said
Dicky it was rather a coincidence because I wired

 Aladdin now has got his wife
 Your Emperor is appeased
 I think youd better come to life
 We hope youve all been pleased

Funny how that old song came up in my head That was fairly
noncommittal and encouragin The only flaw was that his Emperor
wasnt appeased by very long chalks Stalky extricated himself from his
mountain fastnesses and leafed up to Simla at his leisure to be offered
up on the horns of the altar

But I began surely the CommanderinChief is the proper

His Excellency had an idea that if he blew up one single junior
captainsame as King used to blow us uphe was holdin the reins
of empire and of course as long as he had that idea Von Lennaert
encouraged him Im not sure Von Lennaert didnt put that notion into
his head

Theyve changed the breed then since my time I said

Praps Stalky was sent up for his wiggin like a bad little boy Ive
reason to believe that His Excellencys hair stood on end He walked
into Stalky for one hourStalky at attention in the middle of the
floor and so he vowed Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His
Excellencys topknot in dumb show in the background Stalky didnt dare
to look up or hed have laughed

Now wherefore was Stalky not broken publicly said the Infant with a
large and luminous leer

Ah wherefore said Abanazar To give him a chance to retrieve his
blasted career and not to break his fathers heart Stalky hadnt a
father but that didnt matter He behaved like alike the Sanawar
Orphan Asylum and His Excellency graciously spared him Then he came
round to my office and sat opposite me for ten minutes puffing out his
nostrils Then he said Pussy if I thought that baskethanger

Hah He remembered that said McTurk

That twoanna baskethanger governed India I swear Id become a
naturalized Muscovite tomorrow Im a _femme incomprise_ This things
broken my heart Itll take six months shootinleave in India to mend
it Do you think I can get it Pussy

He got it in about three minutes and a half and seventeen days later
he was back in the arms of Rutton Singhhorrid disgracedwith orders
to hand over his command etc to Cathcart MacMonnie

Observe said Dick Four One colonel of the Political Department in
charge of thirty Sikhs on a hilltop Observe my children

Naturally Cathcart not being a fool even if he _is_ a Political let
Stalky do his shooting within fifteen miles of Fort Everett for the
next six months and I always understood they and Rutton Singh and
the prisoner were as thick as thieves Then Stalky loafed back to his
regiment I believe Ive never seen him since

I have though said McTurk swelling with pride

We all turned as one man It was at the beginning of this hot weather
I was in camp in the Jullunder doab and stumbled slap on Stalky in
a Sikh village sitting on the one chair of state with half the
population grovellin before him a dozen Sikh babies on his knees
an old harridan clappin him on the shoulder and a garland o flowers
round his neck Told me he was recruitin We dined together that night
but he never said a word of the business at the Fort Told me though
that if I wanted any supplies Id better say I was Koran Sahibs _bhai_
and I did and the Sikhs wouldnt take my money

Ah That must have been one of Rutton Singhs villages said Dick
Four and we smoked for some time in silence

I say said McTurk casting back through the years did Stalky ever
tell you _how_ RabbitsEggs came to rock King that night

No said Dick Four Then McTurk told I see said Dick Four
nodding Practically he duplicated that trick over again Theres
nobody like Stalky

Thats just where you make the mistake I said Indias full of
StalkiesCheltenham and Haileybury and Marlborough chapsthat we dont
know anything about and the surprises will begin when there is really a
big row on

Who will be surprised said Dick Four

The other side The gentlemen who go to the front in firstclass
carriages Just imagine Stalky let loose on the south side of Europe
with a sufficiency of Sikhs and a reasonable prospect of loot Consider
it quietly

Theres something in that but youre too much of an optimist Beetle
 said the Infant

Well Ive a right to be Aint I responsible for the whole thing You
neednt laugh Who wrote Aladdin now has got his wifeeh

Whats that got to do with it said Tertius

Everything said I

Prove it said the Infant

And I have

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
