CHAPTER I IN WHICH MY KING AND COUNTRY NEED ME


I left the office of The Scout 28 Maiden Lane WC on September 8th
1914 took leave of the editor and the staff said farewell to my little
camp in the beechwoods of Buckinghamshire and to my woodcraft scouts
bade goodbye to my father and went off to enlist in the Royal Army
Medical Corps

I made my way to the Marylebone recruiting office and after waiting
about for hours I went at last upstairs and stripped out with a lot
of other men for the medical examination

The smell of human sweat was overpowering in the little anteroom Some
of the men had hearts and anchors and ships and dancinggirls tattooed
in blue on their chests and arms Some were skinny and others too
fat Very few looked fit I remarked upon the shyness they suffered in
walking about naked

Did yer pass

No e spotted it said the dejected rejected

Wot

Rupture

Got through Alf

No eyesight aint good enough

So it went on for halfanhour

Then came my turn

Ha said the little doctor this is the sort we want and he
rubbed his goldrimmed glasses on his handkerchief Chest
thirtyfourthirtyseven said the doctor tapping with his
tapemeasure How did yer do that

What sir said I gasping for I was trying to blow my chest out or
burst

Had breathing exercises

No sirIm a scout

Ha said he and noticed my knees were brown with sunburn because I
always wore shorts

I passed the eyesight test and they took my name down and my address
occupation and age

Ever bin in the army before

No sir

Married

No sir

Ever bin in prison

No sir

Whats yer religion

Nothing sir

What

Nothing at all

Ah but youve got to ave one in the army

Got to

Yes you must Wots it to beC of E

What dyou mean

Church of England Most of em do

Awful thoughts of church parade flashed through my mind

Right you areQuaker said I

Quaker Is that a religion he asked doubtfully

Yes

I watched him write it down

Right thatll do Report at Munster Road recruiting station Fulham
tomorrow

We were all dressed by this time After a lot more waiting about outside
in a yard a sergeant came and took about eight of us into a room where
there was a table and some papers and an officer in khaki

I spotted a Bible on the table We had to stand in a row while he read
a long list of regulations in which we were made to promise to obey
all orders of officers and noncommissioned officers of His Majestys
Service After that he told us he would swear us in We had to hold up
the right hand above the head and say all together Swhelpmegod

I immediately realised that I had taken an oath which was not in
accordance with my regimental religion

No sooner were we let out than I began to feel the evertightening
tangle of red tape

What the dickens had I enlisted for I asked myself I had lost all
my oldtime freedom I could no longer go on in my old camping and
sketching life I was now a soldiera tommya private I loathed
the army What a fool I was

The next day I reported at Fulham More hours of waiting I discovered
an old postman who had also enlisted in the RAMC and as he
knew the ropes I stuck to him like a leech In the afternoon an old
recruiting sergeant with a husky voice fell us in and we marched a
mob of civilians through the London streets to the railway station
Although this was quite a short distance the sergeant fell us out near
a publichouse and he and a lot more disappeared inside

What a motley crowd we were clerks in bowler hats knuts in brown
suits brown ties brown shoes and a horseshoe tiepin tramplike
looking men in rags and tatters and smelling of dirt and beer and rank
twist

Old soldiers trying to chuck a chest lanky lads from the country
gaping at the houses shops and people

Rough broadspeaking broadshouldered men from the Lancashire
cottonmills shop assistants with polished boots and some even with
kid gloves and a silverbanded cane Here and there was a farmhand in
corduroys and hobnailed cowdungspattered boots puffing at a broken
old clay pipe and speaking in the Darset dialect At the station they
had to have another wet in the refreshment room and by the time the
train was due to start a good many were canned up

Boozy voices yelled out

S long way Tipperairy

Goodbye Bill ave nother swig

Dont ferget ter write Bill

Awright Liz Goodbye Albert

We were locked in the carriage There was much shouting and
laughing And so to Aldershot




CHAPTER II A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY


Aldershot was a seething swarm of civilians who had enlisted Every
class and every type was to be seen We found out the RAMC depot and
reported A man sat at an old soapbox with a lot of papers and we had
to file past him This was in the middle of a field with row upon row of
belltents

Name he snapped

I told him

Age

Religion

Quaker

RightQuaker OatsSection E over there

But my old postman knew better and having found out where Section E
was camped we went off up the town to look for lodging for the night
knowing that in such a crowd of civilians we could not be missed

At last we found a pokey little house where the woman agreed to let us
stay the night and get some breakfast next day

That night was fearful We had to sleep in a double bed and it was
full of fleas The moonlight shone through the window The shadow of a
barrackroom chimneypot slid slowly across my face as the hours dragged
on

We got up about 530 AM so as to get down to the paradeground in
time for the fall in

We washed in a tiny scullery sink downstairs There was a Pears Annual
print of an old fisherman telling a story to a little girl stuck over
the mantelpiece

We had eggs and breadandbutter and tea for breakfast and I think the
woman only charged us three shillings all told

Once down at the paradeground we looked about for Section E and found
their lines in the hundreds of rows of belltents

Life for the next few days was indeed hand to mouth We had to go on
a tentpitching fatigue under a sergeant who kept up a continual flow of
astoundingly profane oaths

Food came down our lines but seldom When it did come you had to fetch
it in a huge dixie and grope with your hands at the bits of gristle
and bone which floated in a lot of greasy water Some one bought a box
of sardines in the next tent

Goin ter share em round said a hungry voice

Nah blooming fear I aintwot yer tike me foreh

Every one was starving I had managed to fish a lump of bone with a
scrag of tough meat on it from the lukewarm slosh in our dixie But
some one who was very hungry and very big came along and snatched it
away before I could get my teeth in it

We had continually to fall in in long rows and answer our names This
was rollcall and rollcall went on morning noon and night Even
when your own particular rollcall was not being called you could hear
some other corporal or sergeant shouting

Jones FWiggins TSimons G Harrison I and so on all day
long

There were no groundsheets to the tents We squatted in the mud and we
had one blanket each which was simply crawling

We were indeed in a far worse condition than many savages Then came the
rain We huddled into the tents There were twentytwo in mine and
as a belltent is full up with eighteen you may imagine how thick the
atmosphere became One old man would smoke his claypipe with
choking twist tobacco Most of the others smoked rank and often damp
woodbines The language was thick with grumbling and much swearing At
first it was not so bad But some one touched the side of the tent and
the rain began to dribble through Then we found a tiny stream of wet
slowly trickling along underneath the tentwalls towards the tentpole
and by night time we were lying and sitting in a pool of mud

About a week later when the sergeantmajor told us on parade that we
were going to Tipperary we all laughed and no one believed it

But the next day they marched us down to the Government siding and
locked us all in a train which took us right away to Fishguard

Some of the men got some breadandcheese before starting but I in
company with a good many others did not

The boat was waiting when they bundled us out on the quay

It was a cattleboat and very small and very smelly There were no
cabins or accommodation of any sort only the cattlestalls down below
Six hundred of us got aboard Out of the six hundred five hundred
were sick It was a very rough crossing and we were all starving and
shivering I had nothing but what I stood up inshirt shorts and
cowboyhat and my old haversack which contained soap towel and razor
and also a sketchbook and a small colourbox

The Irish seawinds whistled up my shortsbut I preferred the icy wind
to the stinking cattlestalls and insectinfested straw below We were
packed in like sardines Men were retching and groaning cussing and
growling At last I found a coil of rope It was a huge coil with a hole
in the centresomething like a large birds nest I got into this hole
and curled up like a dormouse Here I did not feel the cold so much
and lying down I didnt feel sick The moon glittered on the great gray
billows The cattleboat heaved up and slid down the mountains She
pitched and rolled and slithered sideways down the waveslopes And so
to Waterford

From Waterford by train to Tipperary It was early morning The first
thing I noticed was that the grass in Ireland was very green and that
the fields were very small

We had had no food for twentyseven hours I found a very hard crust of
bread in my haversack and eat it while the others were asleep in the
carriage

 Lemnos October 1915


Born and bred in a studio and brought up among the cloudswept
mountains of Westmorland amid the purple heather and the sunset in the
peatmoss puddles barracklife soon became like penal servitude I was
like a caged wild animal I knew now why the tigers and leopards pace up
and down up and down behind their bars at the Zoo

We only stayed a week in the great gray prisonlike barracks at
Tipperary We looked about for the sweetest girl of the songbut the
colleens were disappointing My heart was not right there We moved
to Limerick and in Limerick we stopped for seven solid months

For seven months we did the same old squaddrill every day at the
same time on the same old square until at last we all began to be
unbearably fed up The sections became slack at drill because they
were overdrilled and sickened by the awful monotony of it all

During those seven dreary months in that dismal slumgrown town we
learnt all the tricks of barracklife We knew how to come the old
soldier we knew how and when to wangle out of doing this or that
fatigue we practised the ancient art of going sick when we knew a
long route march was coming off next day

We knew how to square the guard if we came in late and the others
learnt how to dodge church parade

E never goes to church parade

No e was a fly onee was

Wotchermean

Put isself down as Quaker

Lummythats me next time I listQuaker Oats

By this time I had been promoted to the rank of corporal

Next to the regimental sergeantmajor I had the loudest drill voice on
the square and shouting at squaddrill and stretcherdrill was about
the only thing I ever did well in the armyexcept that having been a
scout I was able to instruct the signalling squad

Route marches and fielddays were a relief from the drill square For
five months we got no issue of khaki Many of the men were through at
the knees and tattered at the elbows Some were buttonless and patched
I had to put a patch in my shorts Our civilian boots were wearing
outsome were right through Heels came off when they right turned
others had their soles flapping as they marched

My batman who cleaned my boots and swept out the bunk had his
trousers held together with a huge safetypin The people called us
Kitcheners Ragtime Army We became so torn and worn and ragged
that it was impossible to go out in the town Being the only one in
scout rigout I drew much attention

Ere e comes Moikell

Kitcheners cowboy Isnt he lovely

Bejazus soitis

Come an see PathrickKitcheners
cowboybytheholysufferinjazus

I found an old curioshop down near the docks and here I used to
rummage among the gilded Siamese idols and the painted African gods and
drums I discovered some odd parts of A ThousandandOne Arabian Nights
which I bought for a penny or two and took back to my barrackroom to
read By this means I forgot the gray square and the gray line of the
barracks outside and the bare boards and yellowwashed walls within

I used to practise slipping the guard at the guardroom gate This
form of amusement became quite exciting and I was never caught at it

Next I got a very old and worn copy of the Koran

By this time I was a fullblown sergeant I made a mistake in walking
into the sergeants mess with the Koran under my arm It was
difficult to explain what sort of book it was One day the regimental
sergeantmajor said

You know Hargrave I cant make you out

No sir

Noyoure not a soldier you never will beyou act the part pretty
well But you dont take things seriously enough

We were often out on the Clare Mountains for fielddays with the
stretchersquads Coming back one day I spotted two herons wading among
some yellowochre sedges in a swampy field I determined there and then
to come back and stalk them The following Saturday I set out with a
fellow we called Cherry Blossom because he never cleaned his boots I
took a pair of fieldglasses and Cherry had a bag of pastries which
we bought on the way We stalked those herons for hours and hours We
crept through the reeds hid behind trees and crawled into bushes but
the herons were better scouts We only got about fifty yards up to one
For all that it was like my old scout lifeand we had had a break from
the gray walls and the everlasting saluting of officers

There were rumours of war and thats all we knew of it There were
fresh rumours each day We were going to Egypt We were to be sent to
the East Coast for home defence That offended our martial ardour
When were we going out Should we ever get out Had we got to do squad
drill for duration Had Kitchener forgotten the Xth Division

Now and then a batch of men were put into khaki which arrived at the
quartermasters stores in driblets Some had greeny puttees and sandy
slacks a civvy coat and a khaki cap Others were rigged out in
Kitcheners workhouse blue with little forage caps on one side The
sprinkling of khaki and khakibrowns and greens increased every time we
came on parade until one day the whole of the three field ambulances
were fitted out

The drill went on like clockwork It was as if some curse had fallen
upon us The officers were fed up you could see

And now just a word as to army methods Immediately opposite the
barracks was a cloth factory which was turning out khaki uniforms for
the Government every day

For five months we went about in civilian clothes We were a disgrace as
we marched along Yet because no order had been given to that factory
to supply us with uniforms we had to wait till the uniforms had been
shipped to England and then sent back to Ireland for us to wear

The spark of patriotism which was in each man when he enlisted was dead
We detested the army we hated the routine we were sickened and dulled
and crushed by drill

The old habit of being always on the alert for anything picturesque
saved me from idiotcy Whenever opportunity offered or whenever I could
take French leave I went off with sketchbook and pencil and forgot for
a time the horror of barrackroom life with its unending flow of filthy
language and its barren desolation of yellowwashed walls and broken
windows

And then we moved to Dublin




CHAPTER IV CHARACTERS


It may be very amusing to read about Kipps and those commonplace
people whom Mr HG Wells describes so cleverly but to have to live
with them in barracks is far from pleasant

There were shopassistants dental mechanics city clerks office boys
medical students and a whole mass of very ordinary very uninteresting
people There was a fair sprinkling of mining engineers and miners
and these men were more interesting and of a far stronger mental and
physical development They were huge fullchested strongarmed men who
swore and drank heavily but were honest and straight

There were characters here from the docks and from the merchant
service some of whom had surely been created for WW Jacobs One in
particularJoe Smith a sailorman an enginegreaser I thinkwas
full of queer yarns and seafaring talk He was a little man with beady
eyes and a huge curled moustache He walked about quickly with the
seamens lurch as I have noticed most seagoing men of the merchant
service do

This man came up in bellbottomed trousers and a pea jacket He was
fond of telling a yarn about a vessel which was carrying a snake in a
crate from the West Indies This snake got into the boiler when they
were cleaning out the engineroom

The captin ses to me Joe I ses Yessir Joe says e wots
to be done

Why ses I thing is ter git this ere snake out agin

Jistso says the captin but oo ter do itE always left
everythink ter meand I ses Why sir its thiswise if sobe all the
others are afeared I aint or my names Double Dutch

Very good melad ses the captin I relies on you JoeE always
didand would you believe it I upped an ooked that there great
rattlesnake out of the boiler with an old humbrella

There was a clerk who stood sixfoot eight who was something of a
knut He told me that at home he belonged to a Litry Society and I
asked him what books they had and which he liked

Books he asked Ow dyow mean

You said a Literary Society didnt you

Oh yes we ave got books But you know we go down there and ave
a concert or read the papers and ave a social perhaps you know
sometimes ask the girls round to afternoon tea

I had a barrackroom full of these people to look after Most of them
got drunk Once a young medical student tried to knife me with a Chinese
jackknife which his uncle a missionary had given him He had downed
too much whisky Just as boys do at school so these men formed into
cliques and hung together in twos and threes

Some of them like the litry society clerk had never seen much of
life or people had lived in a little suburban villa and pretended to
be City men Others had knocked about all over the world These were
mostly seafaring men Savage was such a one He was one of the buccaneer
type strong and sunburnt with tattooed arms Often he sang an old
seasong which always ended Fortyfive fadom and a clear sandy
bottom He knew most of the sea chanties of the old days one of which
went something in this way

 Heave away Rio Heave away Rio
 So fare thee well my sweet pretty maid
 Heave away Rio Heave away Rio
 For theres plenty of goldso weve been told
 On the banks of the Sacramento

An old Irish applewoman used to come into the barracks and sit by
the side of the parade ground with two baskets of apples and a box of
chocolate

She did a roaring trade when we were dismissed from drill

We always addressed her as Mother She looked so witchlike that one
day I asked

Can you tell a fortune Mother

Lordloveye no Wad ye have the Cuss o Jazus upon us all Ye shud
see the priest sor

And can he

No Son All witchcraftin is forbid in the Book by the Holy Mother o
Gord so they do be tellin me

Can no one in all Ireland read a fortune now Mother

Ach Son tis died out sure Only in the old outanaway parts tis
done but tis terrible wicked

She was a good bit of colour I have her still in my pocketbook Her
black shawl with her apples will always remind me of early barrackdays
at Limerick if I live to be ninety




CHAPTER V I HEAR OF HAWK


Seldom are we lucky enough to meet in real life a character so strong
and vivid so full of subtle characteristics that his appearance in a
novel would make the authors name Such a character was Hawk

When you consider you find that many an author of note has made a
lasting reputation by evolving some such character and in most cases
this character has been founded on fact For example Stevensons
Long John Silver Kiplings Kim and Rider Haggards Alan
Quatermain

Had Kipling met Hawk he would have worked him into a book of Indian
soldier life for Hawk was full of jungle adventures and stories of the
Indian Survey Department and the Khyber Pass while his descriptions of
Kashmir and Secunderabad with its fakirs and jugglers monkey temples
and sacred bulls were superb

On the other hand Haggard would have placed him somewhere in Africa
a strong hard man trekking across the African veldt he knew so well
for Hawk had been in the Boer War

Little did I realise when I met him on the barracksquare at Limerick
how fate would throw us together upon the scorching sands and rocky
ridges of Gallipoli nor could either of us foresee the hairbreadth
escapes and queer corners in which we found ourselves at Suvla Bay and
on the Serbian frontier

I spotted him in the crowd as the only man on parade with a strong
clearcut face I noted his drooping moustache and especially his keen
grey eyes which glittered and looked through and through Somewhere I
told myself there was good blood at the back of beyond on his line of
descent I was right for as he told me later when I had come to know
him as a trusty friend he came from a Norseman stock The jaw was too
square and heavy but the highbuilt chiselled nose and the deepset
clear grey eyes were a throwback on the old Viking trail Although
dressed in ragged civilian clothes he looked a huge fullgrown
muscular man active and well developed with the arms of a miner and
the chest of a gorilla On one arm I remember he had a heart with a
dagger through it tattooed in blue and red

I heard of him first as one to be shunned and feared For it was said
that when in drink he would pick up the barrackroom fender with one
hand and hurl it across the room I was told that he was a master of the
art of swearingthat he could pour forth a continual flow of oaths for
a full five minutes without repeating one single cuss

My interest was immediately aroused I smelt adventure and I was on the
adventure trail Hawk was not in my barrackroom and therefore I knew
but little of him while in the old country I heard that he had been
galloperdispatchrider to Lord Kitchener in South Africa and I tried
to get him to talk about it As an artists model for a canvas to
be called The Buccaneer Hawk was perfect I never saw a man so
splendidly developed

And Hawk was fifty years old You would take him for thirtynine or so

But drink and the devil had done for the restHawk himself
acknowledged it His vices were the vices of a strong man and when he
was drunk he was the very devil

He was the old soldier and knew all the ins and outs of army life
I quickly became entangled in the interest of unravelling his complex
nature On the one hand he was said to be a desperado and doubledyed
liar On the other hand if he respected you he would always tell you
the naked truth and would never let you down He knew drink was his
ruin but he could not and would not stop it Yet his advice to me
was always good Indeed although he had the reputation of a bold bad
blackguard he never led any one else on the wrong trail and his
advice to young soldiers in the barrackrooms was wonderfully clear and
useful

If he respected you you could trust your life with him If he didnt
you could look up for trouble He was honest and squareif he liked
youbut he could make things disappear by sleight of hand in a manner
worthy of a West End conjurer

He was a miner and had a sound knowledge of mining and practical
geology which many a sciencemaster might have been proud of He had the
eyes of a trained observer and I afterwards discovered he was a crack
shot

Some months later when the ASC ambulance drivers were exercising
their horses he showed himself a good roughrider and I recalled
his galloper days And again at Lemnos and Suvla he was a splendid
swimmer He was an allround man Unlike the other men in barracksthe
shop assistants and clerksHawk never missed noticing small things and
it was this which first drew my attention to him

I remember one night hearing a womans voice wailing a queer Hindoo
chant It came from the barrackroom door Afterwards I discovered it
was Hawk sitting on his trestle bed crosslegged with a bit of sacking
and ashes on his head imitating the deathwail of an Indian woman for
her dead husband

Hawk knew all the rites and ceremonies of the various Hindoo castes and
could act the part of a fakir or a bazaarwullah with wonderful realism

By turns Hawk was a heavy drinker and a clearbrained man of action
calm in danger

In those early days of my military career I looked upon him only as an
author looks upon an interesting character

Months afterwards on the deathswept peninsula Hawk and I became fast
friends The bad man of the ambulance became the most useful most
faithful in my section We went everywhere togetherlike Horace and
Holly of Rider Haggard fame he the great strong man and I the young
artist scout

If Hawk was out of camp you could bet I was alsoand viceversa

Of Hawk more anon




CHAPTER VI ON THE MOVE


We moved to Dublin after seven months of drill and medical lectures in
barracks at Limerick

After about a fortnight in the Portobello Barracks we crossed to England
and pitched our camp at Basingstoke Here we had two or three months
divisional training The whole of the Xth Divisionabout 25000
menused to turn out for long routemarches

We were out in all weathers We took no tents and slept out This
was nothing to me as I had done it on my own when scouting hundreds of
times It amused me to hear the men grumbling about the hard ground and
to see them rubbing their hips when they got up It was a hard training
Still we didnt seem to be going out and once again the novelty of a
new place having worn off we became unspeakably fed up

Here at Basingstoke we were inspected by the King and later by Lord
Kitchener

Then came the issue of pith helmets and khaki drill uniforms and the
Red Cross brassards on the left arm

Rumour ran riot We were going to India we were going to East
Africa some one even mentioned Japan There was a new rumour each
day

Then one day at brief notice we were quietly entrained at Basingstoke
and taken down to the docks at Devonport before anyone had wind of the
matter

All our ambulance wagons and field medical equipment in wickerwork
panniers went with us and it would astonish a civilian to see the
amount of stores and Red Cross materials with which a field ambulance
moves And so after much waiting about aboard the Canada




CHAPTER VII MEDITERRANEAN NIGHTS


Intricate and vivid detail leave a more startling imprint on the
memoryfilm than the main purport of any great adventure whether it be
a polar expedition a new discovery or such a stupendous undertaking as
that in which we were now involved

The fact of our departure had been carefully kept quiet and our
destination was unknown It might have been a secret expedition in
search of buried treasure Yet in spite of all precaution we might be
torpedoed at any moment and go down with all hands or strike a mine and
be blown up We knew that victory or defeat were hanging in the balance
and perhaps the destiny of nations But while the magnitude of the
venture has left no impressionI cannot recall that we ever spoke about
itcommonplace details remain

The pitch bubbling in the seams under a Mediterranean sun the queer
iridescent shapes of glowing greenish phosphorus in the nighttime sea
the butter melting into yellow oil on the plate on the saloon table
the sickly smell of steam and grease and oil from the engineroom the
machine gun fixed at the stern with its waterproof hood the increasing
brilliance of the stars and the rapid descent of evening upon the
splendid colourprism of a Mediterranean sunsetthese and thousands of
other intimate commonplaces are inlaid for ever in my mind

We went about in our shirts and drill slacks and the scorching
boards of the deck blistered our naked feet In a few days we became
suntanned Each one of us had a sunburnt Vshaped triangle on the chest
where we left our shirts open

The voyage was uneventful The food was poor There was very little
fresh water to drink It was July The heat was fatiguing and the
sunglare blinding

The coast of Algeria on our right looked bare and terribly forsaken
It had an awfulness about ita mystery look it looked like a juju
country with its sandy spit running like a narrow ribbon to the blue
sea and its hazy craggy mountains quivering in the noonday heat

Hawk and I were in the habit of coming up from our bunks in the
evening We used to lean over the handrail and watch the wonder of
a Mediterranean sunset transform in schemes of peacockblue and
beetlegreen down and down through emerald pale gold and lemon
yellow and so to the horizon of the inland sea in bands of deep chrome
and orange scarlet mauve and purple

Hawk was the only man I discovered in all those hundreds of apparently
commonplace souls who could really appreciate and never tire of watching
and discussing these things

I had often heard of the blue of the Mediterranean But I must confess
that I rather thought it had been exaggerated by authors artists and
poets as a fruitful and beautiful source of inspiration

I never saw such blues before electricblue and deep seething navy
blue flecked with foam and silver spray calm lapislazuli blue a
sort of greeny mummycase blue flashing silkshot blue like a
kingfishers feathers Sometimes the sea was as calm as a millpond and
you could see down and down and down

There is a certain milky look in the waters of the Mediterranean which
I never saw anywhere else What it is I do not know but it hangs in the
water like a cloud Once there was a shoal of porpoises playing round
us and they curled and dived and flopped in the warm blue seas

At night Hawk and I stood for hours watching first one constellation
light up and then another till the whole purplevelvet of the
Mediterranean night sky was pinholed with the old familiar stardesigns

It struck me as most extraordinary and almost uncanny to see the same
old stars we knew in England still above us so many hundred miles from
home

Phosphorescent fragments went floating along beneath us like bits of
broken moonlight

In watching and talking of these things I quickly perceived in Hawk
a man who not only noticed small detail and took a real interest in
Nature but one who had a sound natural philosophy and a good idea of
the reasonable and scientific explanation of things which so many people
either ignore or look upon as atheistic

We did not yet know whither we were sailing We knew we were part of the
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and that was all

One day we put in at Malta

Here the fruitboats all painted green and red and white and blue came
rowing out to meet us The Maltese who manned them stood upto row their
oarsand rowed the right way forwards instead of facing the wrong
way as we do in England They were selling tomatoes and pears apples
chocolate cigars cigarettes Turkish delight and lace

Continually they cried their goods

Ceegarette

Ceegarette

Tomart Tomart

One man recognised us as the Irish Division and shouted

Irish Irish My father Irishfrom Dundee

Here were divingboys in their own tiny boats diving for pennies They
were wonderfully lithe and graceful with suntanned limbs and dripping
black hair

Here too was a huge old man who was also diving for pennies and tins
of bullybeef He was fat and sunbrowned and his muscles and chest
were well developed

Me dive for bullybeef he shouted Me dive for bullybeef

Never once did he fail to retrieve these tins when they were chucked
overboard

The tomatoes were very large and ripe and the tobacco and cigarettes
exceedingly cheap and good Most of the men got a stock

The next day we put to sea again

It was a real voyage of adventure for here we were on an unknown
course sailing under sealed orders no one knew whither nor did we
know what would be the climax to this great enterprise

Would any of us ever return across those bluegreen waters Or would
our bones lie a few days hence bleaching on the yellow sands 
Mystery and adventure sailed with usand each day the heat increased
The sun blazed from a brazen sky the shadow of the halyards and the
great ventilators were clearcut black silhouettes upon the baking
decks

The decks were crammed with that same khaki crowd of civilians who had
cursed and sworn and drilled and growled for ten long months in the
Old Country You imagine what desperate adventurers they had suddenly
become Some had never been out of Ireland others had been as far as
Portsmouth and taken a return voyage to the Isle of Wight And each day
we zigzagged across the blue seas towards some unknown Fate death
perhaps victory or failurewho could tell

Until one day a thin yellowishwhite streak appeared upon the sealine
little groups of palms huddled together and here and there a white dome
or a needleminaret And so we warped into harbour through the boom and
past the lightships to join the crowd of transports and battle cruisers
lying off this muddled citythe city of wonderful colour Alexandria

 J H October 1915


The coalyards and dingy quays looked gray and chill Here were
graypainted Government sheds with white numbers on the sliding doors
dull gray trucks and dirty sidings

A couple of Egyptian native police in khaki drill brown belts
sidearms red fezes and carrying canes both smoking cigarettes
swaggered up and down in front of an arclight

There were dumpyards and gray tin offices rusty cranes and a gray
floating quay Gangs of Egyptian beggars in ragged clothes and a flock
of little brown children continually dodged the native police as we
sailed slowly through the docks They were the only touch of colour in a
muddle of Government buildings stores and transport ships

We were all crowding to the handrail looking overboard The Egyptian
sunset had just vanished and the deep blue of an Eastern night held the
docks in a haze of gloom

The pipe band of the Inniskillings was playing The Wearin o the
Green in that mournful gurgling chant which we came to know so well

One of the little Egyptian beggargirls was dancing to it on the
floating quay down below us by the flicker of the arclamp She was a
tiny mite with a shock of black hair and brown face and arms She wore
a pink dress with some brass buttons hung round her neck She danced
with all the supple gracefulness of the outdoor tribes of the desert
never out of step always true and rhythmic in every motion of arms and
body

When the pipes on board trailed away with a hiss of wind and a choking
gurgling noise into silence the little dancing girl began to sing in
a deep musical voicethe voice of one who has lived outofdoors in
tents

 Itta long wayTippleairy
 Long way to go
 Long wayTippleairy
 Sweetie girl I know

She sang in broken English and danced to the tune which she knew
perfectly

The khaki crowd aboard whistled and cheered and laughed Some one threw
a penny The whole gang of beggars scrambled after it and there ensued
a scrimmage with much shouting and swearing in Arabic

We could see the city lit up beyond the dull gray docks

Next morning we went for a route march through Alexandria We
marched through the dockyards Gangs of native workmen in native
costumecoloured robes and bare feet turbans and red fezeswere
working on the transports unloading box after box of bullybeef and
biscuit and piling them in huge dumps on the quays Rusty chains
clanked steam cranes rattled and puffed out whiffs of white steam

But they did not hustle or hurry They worked under the direction of
English sergeants and officers loading and unloading

At last we got outside the zone of awful ugliness which follows the
British wherever they go The docks were left behind and the change was
sudden and startling

It was like putting down a novel by Arnold Bennett and taking up the
Koran

I did not trouble to keep in step or cover off My eyes were trying
to take in the splendid Eastern scenes Here were figures which had come
right out of the Arabian Nights

Was that not Haroun Al Raschid Commander of the Faithful disguised
as a watercarrier with a goatskin bottle slung over his shoulder and
great yellow baggy trousers and a striped cummerbund

Here were veiled women and old men squatting under their open bazaar
fronts with coloured mats and blinds strung across the narrow streets
Fruit sellers surrounded by melons and beans tomatoes and figs and
datesa jumble of colour orange scarlet green and gold Pitchers
and jars and woven carpets queer Eastern scents shuttered windows and
flat roofs mules and here and there a loaded camel two Jews in black
robes a band of wildlooking desert wanderers in white with hoods and
veils

Egyptian women carrying little brown babies who would believe there
could be such figures such colour and picturesque compositions

It was a short march but we saw much

So this was the land of Egypt It was good What a pity we could see so
little of it

There were very smartly dressed French women with faces powdered and
painted and scented Old men with hollow eyes and yellow parchment
skins all creased and wrinkled squatted on the cobblestones smoking
hubblebubbles and long ivorystemmed pipes

Arab boys selling oranges ran about the streets The heat was
stiflingthe shadows purpleblack the sunlight glared goldenwhite on
the buildings and towers and minarets

Here were curioshops with queer oriental carvings and alabaster
figures

It was like a chapter of my _ThousandandOne Nights_ come true and I
remembered the gray barracks at Limerick and the incessant drill

At last we marched back through the docks and aboard the Canada Next
morning we were sailing far away upon a blue sea Just a glimpse of
the city of wonderful colour and we were once more creeping closer and
closer to the mystery of our unknown venture

Many of us would never pass that way againand each one wondered
sometimes if he would be claimed by that Mechanical Death which none of
us fully realised

Only a few short hoursa day or two longerand we should be plunged
into battle A bullet for one shrapnel for another dysentery for a
third a bayonet or death from weakness and starvation

The great game of luck was gathering faster and faster We loafed about
on deck and wondered where we were going and what it would be like
our minds were thinking of the immediate future Each one tried to make
out he didnt care but each one was thinking upon the same subjecthis
luck fate kismet How many would return to old Englandshould I be
one or would the Eastern sunshine blaze down upon my decomposing body
on some barren sandy shore

We passed many of the Greek Islandssome came up pink and mauve out
of the sea others were green with vineyards once or twice a little
triangularsailed boat bobbed along the coast

The uncertainty was a strain and we felt utterly cut off until at
last we sighted a sandy streak and later a line of volcaniclooking
peaksthe Isle of Lemnos




CHAPTER IX MAROONED ON LEMNOS ISLAND


 LEMNOS HARBOUR

 Within the outer anchorage
 The ancient Argonauts lay to
 Little they dreamtthat dauntless crew
 That here today in the sheltered bay
 Where the seas are still and blue
 Great battleships should froth and
 hum And mighty transportvessels come
 Serenely floating through

 With magic sail the Argonauts
 Stood by to go about
 Little they thoughtthat hero band
 As they made once more for an unknown land
 In a world of terror and doubt
 That here in the wake of the magical bough
 Should come the allterrible ironclad now
 Serenely floating out

 Written on Mudros Beach Oct 7 1915


July the twentyseventh

The deadly silence

The tenderfoot on an expedition of this sort naturally expects to find
himself plunged into a whirl of noise and tumult

The crags were colourless and shimmering in the heat The harbour was
calm and greenyblue One by one with our haversacks and waterbottles
belts and rolled overcoats we went down the companionway into the
waiting surfboats Again and again these boats roped together and
tugged by a little launch went back and forth from the SS Canada to
the Turks Head Piera tiny wooden jetty built by the Engineers

I asked one of the strawhatted men of the Naval Division who was
casting off the painter what the place was like

Sand an flies and flies an sandnothinkelse he replied

No sooner ashore than the green and black flies came pestering and
tormenting like a host of wicked jinn The glare of sunlight on
the yellow sand hurt the eyes The deadly silence of the place was
oppressiveespecially when you had strung yourself up to concert pitch
to face the crash and turmoil of a fearful battle

The quiet isolation and khaki desolation of jagged peaks and sandy
slopes was nervebreaking

You could see the thin lines of the wireless station and little groups
of white belltents dotted here and there

Robinson Crusoe wasnt in it Sand and flies and sun sun and flies and
sand

Wot ave we struck ere Bill

Some dd desert island I reckon

A blasted heath

Gordlummy look at the dd flies

Curse the  sun sweats trickling down me back

And curse all the dd issue

What the holy son of Moses did we join for

We growled and groaned and cursed our luck The sweat ran down under our
pith helmets and soaked in a stream from under our armpits We trudged
to our campingplace along the shore One or two Greek natives followed
us about with melons to sell Parched and choked with sand we were only
too glad to buy these watermelons for two or three leptas

The rind was green like a vegetable marrow but the inside was yellow
with pink and crimson pipsthe colour of a Mediterranean sunset

One day ashore on this accursed island and the diarrhoea set in I never
saw men suffer such awful stomachpains before The continual eating of
melons to allay the blistering thirst helped the disease Many men slept
close to the latrines too weak to crawl to and fro all night long The
sun blazed and the flies in thousands of millions swarmed and irritated
from early morning till sundown

At night it was cold The stars burned whitehota calm fierce
glitter

Hawk and I kipped down slept together on a sandy stretch overlooking
the bay We could see the greenandred electric lights of the hospital
ships waiting in the harbourfor us perhaps

The graft work was fearful All day long we were at it hauling up
our equipment from the beach where it had been dumped ashore Medical
panniers operating marquee tents and tentpoles cookhouse dixies
picks and shovels bully and biscuit boxes and a hundredandone
articles necessary to the work of the Medical Corps in the field all
this had to be manhandled through the sand up to our camp about a mile
away And the sun blazed and the flies pestered and stung and buzzed
and fought with each other for the drops of sweat streaming down your
face How long should we be here When were we going into action The
suspense was brainracking The diarrhoea increased everyone went down
with it Some got the ague shivers and some a touch of dysentery

We became gloomy and bodily sick We wanted to get into itinto
action

Anything would be better than this Godforsaken island Why the dickens
did they leave us moping here working in the blazing heat and crawling
to the latrines in the chilly nights For goodness sake lets get out
of it Lets get to work So the days dragged on

The natives wore baggy trousers and coloured headbands They sat all
day near our camp selling melons tomatoes very cheap and tasteless
chocolates raisins figs and dates

We used to go down to swim in the little baylike semicircle of the
harbour The water was always warm and very salt Here were tiny
shoals of tiny fish The water was clear and glassy There were pinky
seaurchins with spikey spines which jabbed your feet The sandy bed of
the bay was all ribbed with ripples

The island was humming and ticking like a watch with insectnoises
otherwise the deadly silence held There were redwinged grasshoppers
and great greengray locustlooking crickets which whistled and
cricked all night

We had to fetch our water from the watertank boats about a mile and a
half distant and haul it up in a watercart

Gangs of natives were working under the military authorities There
were Greeks and GreekArmenians Turks and Ethiopians Egyptians and
halfbreeds of all kinds from Malta and Gib They were employed in
making roads and clearing the ground for huts and camps

And all the time we had no letters from home We were actually marooned
on Lemnos Island as literally marooned on a barren desert isle as any
buccaneer of the old Spanish galleon days We went suddenly back to a
savage life We went down to bathe stark naked with the sunset glowing
orange on our sunburnt limbs Here it was that Hawk proved himself a
wonderfully good swimmer He was lithe and supple and wellmadean
extraordinary specimen of virile manhoodand he spent his fiftieth
birthday on Lemnos

One day came the order to pack up and manhandle all our stuff down
to the beach ready for reembarkation At last we were on the move We
worked with a will now The great day would soon dawn Some of us would
get put out of mess no doubt but this waiting about to get killed
was much worse than plunging into the thick of it

August the 6th saw us steaming out at night towards the great unknown
climaxthe New Landing




CHAPTER X THE NEW LANDING


A pale pink sunrise burst across the eastern sky as our transport
came steaming into the bay The haze of early morning dusk still held
blurring the mainland and water in misty outlines

Hawk and I had slept upon the deck Now we got up and stretched our
cramped limbs Slowly we warped through the quiet seas

You must understand that we knew not where we were We had never heard
of Suvla Baywe didnt know what part of the Peninsula we had reached
The mystery of the adventure made it all the more exciting It was to be
a new landing by the Xth Divisionthat was all we knew

Some of us had slept and some had lain awake all night Rapidly the
pink sunrise swept behind the rugged mountains to the left and was
reflected in wobbling ripples in the bay

We joined the host of battleships monitors and troopships standing
out and stood by

We could hear the rattle of machineguns in the distant gloom beyond
the streak of sandy shore The decks were crowded with that same khaki
crowd We all stood eagerly watching and listening The deathsilence
had come upon us No one spoke No one whistled

We could see the lighters and small boats towing troops ashore We saw
the men scramble out only to be blown to pieces by land mines as
they waded to the beach On the Lala Baba side we watched platoons and
companies form up and march along in fours all in step as if they were
on parade

In fours I exclaimed to Hawk who was peering through my
fieldglasses

Sheer murder said Hawk

No sooner had he spoken than a high explosive from the Turkish
positions on the Sari Bair range came screaming over the Salt Lake
ZzzeeeooopCrash

They lay there like a little group of dead beetles and the wounded were
crawling away like ants into the dead yellow grass and the sage bushes
to die A whole platoon was smashed

It was not yet daylight We could see the flicker of riflefire and the
crackle sounded first on one part of the bay and then another Among
the dark rocks and bushes it looked as if people were striking thousands
of matches

Mechanical Death went steadily on Four Turkish batteries on the Kislar
Dargh were blown up one after the other by our battleships We watched
the thick rolling smoke of the explosions and saw bits of wheels and
the arms and legs of gunners blown up in little black fragments against
that pearlpink sunrise

The noise of Mechanical Battle went surging from one side of the bay to
the otherit swept round suddenly with an angry rattle of maxims and
the hard echoing crackle of riflefire

Now and then our battleships crashed forth and their shells went
hurtling and screaming over the mountains to burst with a muffled roar
somewhere out of sight

Mechanical Death moved back and forth It whistled and screamed and
crashed It spat fire and unfolded puffs of grey and white and black
smoke It flashed tongues of livid flame like some devilish anteater
lapping up its insects and the insects were the sons of men

Mechanical Death as we saw him at work was hard and metallic
steelstudded and shrapneltoothed Now and then he bristled with
bayonets and they glittered here and there in tiny groups and charged
up the rocks and through the bushes

The noise increased Mechanical Death worked first on our side and then
with the Turks He led forward a squad and the next instant mowed them
down with a hail of lead He galloped up a battery unlimberedand
before the first shell could be rammed home Mechanical Death blew the
whole lot up with a high explosive from a Turkish battery in the hills

And so it went on hour after hour Crackle rattle and roar scream
whistle and crash We stood there on the deck watching men get killed
Now and then a shell came wailing and moaning across the bay and
dropped into the water with a great column of spray glittering in the
early morning sunshine A German Taube buzzed overhead the humhumhum
of the engine was very loud She dropped several bombs but none of them
did much damage The little yellowskinned observation balloon floated
above one of our battleships like a penny toy The Turks had several
shots at it but missed it every time

The incessant noise of battle grew more distant as our troops on shore
advanced It broke out like a bushfire and spread from one section
to another Mechanical Death pressed forward across the Salt Lake It
stormed the heights of the Kapanja Sirt on the one side and took Lala
Baba on the other Puffs of smoke hung on the hills and the shore
was all wreathed in the smoke of rifle and machinegun fire A deadly
conflict thisfor one Turk on the hills was worth ten British down
below on the Salt Lake

There was no glory Here was Death sure enoughMechanical Death run
amokbut where was the glory

Here was organised murderbut it was steelcold There was no
handtohand glory A mine dispersed you before you had set foot on dry
land or a high explosive removed your stomach and left you a mangled
heap of human flesh instead of a medically certified healthy human
being

Mechanical Death wavered and fluctuatedbut it kept going If it
slackened its murderous fire at one side of the bay it was only to
burst forth afresh upon the other

We wondered how it was that we were still alive when so many lay dead
Some were killed on the decks of the transports by shrapnel

Our monitors crept close to the sandy shore and poured out a deadly
brood of Death

The crack and crash was deafening and it literally shook the air it
quivered like a jelly after each shot

The fighting got more and more inland and the rattle and crackle
fainter and farther away But we still watched fascinated

The little groups of men lay in exactly the same positions on the beach
That platoon by the side of Lala Baba lay in a black bunchstone
dead We could see our artillery teams galloping along like a team of
performing fleas taking up new positions behind Lala Baba So this is
war Well its pretty awful Wholesale murder whats it all for
Wonder how long we shall last alive before Mechanical Death blows our
brains out or a leg off

Queer thing war Didnt think it was quite like this So mechanical and
senseless

And now came the time for us to land A lighter came alongside with a
little redbearded man in command

Remind you of any one I said to Hawk

Capn Kettle

Yes

He was exactly like Cutcliffe Hynes famous Kettle except that he
smoked a pipe We huddled into the lighter and hauled our stores down
below Some of us were green about the gills and some were trying to
pretend we didnt care

We watched the boat which landed just before us strike a mine and be
blown to pieces Encouraging sight At last we reached the tiny cove
and the lighter let down a sort of tailboard on the sand




CHAPTER XI THE KAPANJA SIRT


One had his stomach blown out and the other his chest blown in The two
bodies lay upon the sand as we stepped down

The metallic rattle of the firingline sounded far away We manhandled
all our medical equipment and stores from the hold of the lighter to the
beach

We had orders to fall in the stretcherbearers and work in open
formation to the firingline

The Kapanja Sirt runs right along one side of Suvla Bay It is one
wing of that horseshoe formation of rugged mountains which hems in the
Anafarta Ova and the Salt Lake

Our searching zone for wounded lay along this ridge which rises like
the vertebrae of some great antediluvian reptiledropping sheer down
on the Gulf of Saros side and in varying slopes to the plains and the
Salt Lake on the other

Here again small things left a vivid impressionthe crack of a rifle
from the top of the ridge and a party of British climbing up the rocks
and scrub in search of the hidden Turk

The smell of human blood soaking its way into the sand from those two
stiffies on the beach The sullen silence except for the distant
crackle and the occasional moan of a shell The rain which came pelting
down in great cold blobs splashing and soaking our thin drill clothes
till we were wet to the skin and shivering with cold

We were all thinking Who will be the first to get plugged We moved
slowly along the ridge searching every bush and rock for signs of
wounded men

We wondered what the first case would beand which squad would come
across it

I worked up and down the line of squads trying to keep them in touch
with each other We were carrying stretchers haversacks iron rations
medical haversacks medical waterbottles our own private waterbottles
filled on Lemnos Island and three monkeyboxes or field medical
companions

Those we had left on the beach were busy putting up the operating
marquee and other tents and the cooks in getting a fire going and
making tea

The stretchersquads worked slowly forward We passed an old Turkish
well with a stoneflagged front and a stone trough Later on we came
upon the trenches and bivouacs of a Turkish sniping headquarters There
were all kinds of articles lying about which had evidently belonged to
Turkish officers tobacco in a heap on the ground near a bent willow and
thorn bivouac part of a field telephone with the wires running
towards the upper ridges of Sirt the remains of some dried fish and
an earthenware jar or chattie which had held some kind of wine a few
very hard biscuits and a mass of brandnew clothing striped shirts and
white shirts grey military overcoats yellow leather shoes with pointed
toes a red fez a great padded bodybelt with tapes to tie it a pair
of boots and some richly coloured handkerchiefs and waistbands all
striped and worked and fringed

It was near here that our first man was killed later in the day He was
looking into one of these bivouacs and was about to crawl out when a
bullet went through his brain It was a snipers shot We buried him
in an old Turkish trench close by and put a cross made of a wooden
bullybeef crate over him

The sun now blazed upon us and our rainsoaked clothes were steaming
in the heat The open fanlike formation in which we moved was not a
success We lost the officers and continually got out of touch with
each other

At last we reached the zone of spent bullets
Zzzzeeeeeppzing Sssippp

That one was jist by me left ear said Sergeant Joe Smith although
as a matter of fact it was yards above his head Here among a hail of
moaning spent shots our officers called a halt made us fall in in
close formation and we retiredwhat for I do not know

We went back as far as the old Turkish well Here Hawk had something to
say

Our place is advancing said he not retiring because of a few spent
bullets Theres men there dying for want of medical attentionbleeding
to death

The next time we went forward that day was in Indian file each
stretchersquad following the one in front

A parson came with us I marched just behind the adjutant and the
parson walked with me He was a big man and a fair age We went past the
well and the bivouacs I could see he was very nervous

Do you think we are out of danger here he asked

I think so sir we were three miles from the firingline A few
paces further on

I wonder how far the firingline is

Couldnt say sir

A yard or so and then

Dyou suppose the British are advancing

I hope so And after a minute or two

I wonder if there are any Turks near here

I made no answer and marvelled greatly that the man of God should
not be better prepared to meet his Maker of Whom in civil life he had
talked so much

It was just then that I spotted ita little black figure motionless
away beyond the bushes on the right




CHAPTER XII THE SNIPERHUNT


He lay flat under a huge rock I left the stretchersquads and
crawling behind a bush looked through the glasses It certainly was a
Turk and his position was one of hiding He kept perfectly motionless
on his stomach and his rifle lay by his side

I sent a message to pass the word up to the leading squads for Hawk
Quickly he came down to me and took the glasses He had wonderful sight
After looking for a few seconds he agreed that it looked like a Turkish
sniper lying in wait

Lets go and see anyway said I

Chance it

Yes

Righto

Hawk led the way down into the thornbushes and driedup plants I
followed close at his heels We crouched as we went and kept well
under cover Hawk took a semicircular route which I could see would
ultimately bring us out by the side of the rock under which the sniper
hid

Now we caught a glimpse of the little dark figurethen we plunged
deeper into the rank willowgrowth and bore round to the right

Hawk unslung the great jackknife which hung round his waist and
silently opened the gleaming blade I did the same

Ill surprise him you can leave it to me to get in a good slash said
Hawk and I saw the great muscles of his miners arms tighten But if
he gets one in on me he whispered be ready with your knife at the
back of his neck

A few steps farther brought us suddenly upon the rock and the sniper
Hawk was immediately in front of me and his arm was held back ready
for a mighty blow He stood perfectly still looking at the rock and I
watched his muscles relax

See it he said

What

Dead

There was the Turka great heatswollen figure stinking in the
sunshine As I moved forward a swarm of green and black flies which
had been feeding on his face and crawling up his nostrils went up in a
humming buzzing cloud

A bit of wood lying near had looked like his rifle from a distance and
now we saw that instead of lying on his stomach he was lying on his
back and looked as if he had been killed by shrapnel

Putrid stink said I come onlets clear out

And so our sniperhunt led to nothing but a dead Turk stewing in the
glaring sunshine We rejoined the squads No one had missed us This
first day was destined to be one of many adventures




CHAPTER XIII THE ADVENTURE OF THE WHITE PACKMULE


That night was dark with no stars I didnt know what part of Gallipoli
we were in and the maps issued were useless

The first cases had been picked up close to the firingline and were
mostly gunshot wounds and nowlate in the eveningall my squads
having worked four miles to the beach I was trying to get my own
direction back to the ambulance

The Turks seldom fired at night so that it was only the occasional
shot of a British rifle or the sudden poppoppoppoppop of a
machinegun which told me the direction of the firingline

I trudged on and on in the dark stumbling over rocks and slithering
down steep crags tearing my way through thorns and brambles and
sometimes rustling among high dry grass

Queer scents pepperminty and sagelike smells came in whiffs It was
cold I must have gone several miles along the Kapanja Sirt when I came
to a halt and once more tried to get my bearings I peered at the gloomy
sky but there was no star I listened for the laplap of water on the
beach of Suvla Bay but I must have been too far up the ridges to hear
anything There was dead silence When I moved a little green lizard
scutted over a white rock and vanished among the dead scrub

I was past feeling hungry although I had eaten one army biscuit in the
early morning and had had nothing since

It was extraordinarily lonely You may imagine how queer it was for
here was I trying to get back to my ambulance headquarters at night on
the first day of landingand I was hopelessly lost It was impossible
to tell where the firingline began I reckoned I was outside the
British outposts and not far from the Turkish lines Once as I went
blundering along over some rocks a dark figure bolted out of a bush and
ran away up the ridge in a panic

Halt I shouted trying to make believe I was a British armed sentry
But the figure ran on and I began to stride after it This led me
up and up the ridge over very broken ground Whoever it was it was
probably a Turkish sniper for there were many out nightscouting I
lost sight and sound of him

I went climbing steadily up till at last I found myself looking into
darkness I got down on my hands and knees and peered over the edge of a
ridge of rock I could see a tiny beam of light away down and this
beam grew and grew as it slowly moved up and up till it became a great
triangular ray It swept slowly along the top of what I now saw was
a steep precipice sloping sheer down into blackness below One step
further and I should have gone hurtling into the sea For although I
did not then know it this was the topmost ridge of the Kapanja Sirt

The great searchlight came nearer and nearer and I slid backwards and
lay on my stomach looking over The nearer it came the lower I moved
so as to get well off the skyline when the beam reached me It may have
been a Turkish searchlight It swept slowly slowly till at last it was
turned off and everything was deadly black

I started off again in another direction keeping my back to the ridge
as I reckoned that to be a Turkish searchlight and therefore our own
lines would be somewhere down the ridge Here high up I could just see
a grey streak which I took to be the bay

I tried to make for this streak I scrambled down a very steep stratum
of the mountainside and landed at last in a little patch of dead grass
and tall driedup thistles

By this time having come down from my high position on the Sirt I
could no longer see the bay but I judged the direction as best I could
and without waiting I tramped on

I began to wonder how long I had been trudging about and I put it at
about two hours

Haltwho are you called a voice down below

Friend stretcherbearer I shouted

Come herethis way answered the voice

I went down to a clump of bushes and a man with a rifle slung over his
shoulder stepped forward and we both glared at each other for a second

Do yer know where the 45th Company is

No idea said I

Any water

Not a drop left

Were trying to get back to the firingline but were all losttheres
eight of us

Im trying to get to the 32nd Field Ambulancedyou know the way

Yes go right ahead there he pointed and keep well down off the
hillsyoull see the beach when youve gone for a mile or so

How far is it

Bout four miles and then Got a match

Yesbut its dangerous to light up

Must ave a smokenothink to eat or drink

Well here you are light up inside my helmet

He did this hid the lighted match from any snipers eye The other
seven men came crawling out of the bushes to light up their woodbines
and fagends

Well Im off said I and once more went forward in the direction
pointed out by the corporal and his lost squad

So long mategood luck he shouted

Same to you I called back

And now came sleep upon me Even as I walked an awful weariness fell
upon every limb My legs became heavy and slow That short rest had
stiffened me and my eyelids closed as I trudged on I lifted them with
an effort and dragged one foot after the other I knew I must get back
to my unit and that here it was very dangerous I wanted to lie down
on the dead grass and sleep and sleep and sleep I urged my muscles to
swing my legsfor I knew if once I sat down to rest I should never keep
awake

It was while I was thus trying to jerk my sleepy nerves on to action
that I came upon a zigzagged trench It was fully six feet deep and
about a yard wide It was of course an old Turkish defence running
crosswise along the great backbone of the Sirt I knew now that I was
nearing the bay for most of these trenches overlooked the beach

There was a white object about ten yards from me What it was I could
not tell and a quiver of fear ran through me and threw off the awful
sleepiness of fatigue

Was it a Turkish snipers shirt Or was it a piece of white cloth or a
sheet of paper In the gloom of night I could not discover

However I determined to go steady and I crept up to a dark thornbush
and stood still It did not move Still standing against the dark bush to
hide the fact that I was unarmed I shouted

Halt who are you in as gruff and threatening a tone as I could
command

Silence It did not move I ran forward along the trench and there
found a white packmule all loaded up with baggage I could make out
the queerly worked trappings with brasscoins on the fringed bridle
and coloured flytassels over the eyes It was stone dead and stiff Its
eyes glared at mea glassy glare full of fear The Turkish packmule
had been bringing up material to the Turks in the trench when it had
been killedand now the deep sides of the trench were holding it
upright

I trudged away towards the beach and lay down to sleep at last among the
other men of the ambulance who were lying scattered about behind tufts
of bush or against ledges of rock

When weighed down with sleep any bed will serve

And this was the end of our first days work on the field




CHAPTER XIV THE SNIPER OF THE PEARTREE GULLY


We used to start long before daylight when the heavy gloom of early
morning swept mountain sea and sand in an indistinct haze when the
cobwebs hung thick from thorn to thorn like fairy catscradles all
dripping and beaded with those heavy dews The guard would wake us up
about 330 AM We were asleep anywhere lying about under rocks and in
sandy dells sleeping on our haversacks and waterbottles and our pith
helmets near by We got an issue of biscuit and jam or biscuit and
bullybeef to take with us and each one carried his iron rations in a
little bag at his side

So we set offa long straggling followmyleader line
of men and stretchers The officer first then the
stretchersergeantmyselfand the squads two men to a stretcher
carrying the stretchers folded up and last of all a corporal or a
lancejack bringing up the rear in case any one should fall out

Cold dark shivery mornings they were our clothes soaked in dew
and our pith helmets reeking wet with the puggaree all beaded with
dewdrops We toiled up and up the ridges and gullies of the Kislar
Dargh and the Kapanja Sirt slowly like a little column of ants going
out to bring in the ant eggs

Often we had to wait while the Indian transport came down from the
hilltrack before we could proceed and we always came upon the
Engineers fieldtelegraph wires on the ground I would shout Wire
over my shoulder and the shout Wire Wire Wire went down the
line from squad to squad

From the old Turkish well I led my stretchersquads past the gun of the
Field Artillery mounted quite near our hospital tents along a track
which ran past a patch of dry yellow grass and dead thistleshere
among the prickly plants and sagebushes grew a white flowerpure and
sweetscentedsomething like a flaga holy flower among the dead and
scorchedup yellow ochre blades and the khaki and dull greygreens of
thorns We went along this track past the dead sniper which Hawk and
I had so carefully stalked Near by hidden by bushes and rank willow
thickets lay a dozen more dead Turks swollen flyblown and stinking in
the broiling sun We hurried on past the Turkish bivouacsmany of the
relics had been picked up by the British Tommies since last I saw the
place the tobacco had all gonemany of the shirts and overcoats which
had been lying about had disappearedthe place had been thoroughly
ransacked We trudged past the wooden cross of our dead comrade and we
were silent

Indeed throughout those first three daysSaturday Sunday and
Mondaywhen the British and Turks grappled to and fro and flung
shrapnel at each other incessantly when the fighting line swayed
and bent sometimes pushing back the Turks sometimes bending in the
British when the fate of the whole undertaking still hung in the
balance when what became a semifailure might have been a staggering
success in those days the deathsilence fell upon us all

No one whistled those ragtime tunes no one tried to make jokes except
the very timid and they giggled nervously at their own

No one spoke unless it was quite necessary Each man you passed asked
you the vital question Any water

For a moment as he asks his eyes glitter with a gleam of hopewhen you
shake your head he simply trudges on over the rocks and scrub with the
same fatigued and sullen dullness which we all suffered

Often you asked the same question yourself with parched and burning
lips

One after another we came upon the wounded Here a man dragging a
broken leg along with him Here a man holding his fractured forearm and
running towards us Sometimes the pitiful cry faint and full of agony
Stretchers Stretcherbearers away in some densely overgrown defile
swept with bullets and shrapnel

And so at last all my squads had turned back with stretchers loaded with
men and pieces of men I went on alonea lonely figure wandering about
the mountains looking and listening for the wounded

I came now upon a party of Engineers at work making a road They were
working with pickaxe and spadeclearing away bush and rocks

Any water they asked

I shook my head

Any wounded I said

Some down there they say said a redfaced man

Damn rotten job that muttered another as I went on

Better keep well over in the bushes shouted the redfaced man
Theyve got this bit of lightcoloured ground markedyoure almost
sure ter git plugged

Thanks I called back and broke off to my left among the sage and
thistle and thorn

I went now downhill into an overgrown watercourse very much like the
one in which I used to sleep and eat away back by the artillery big
gun Here were willows and brambles with ripe blackberries and
wildrose bushes with scarlet hips Just like England I thought

And then as I crossed the little drybed stream and came out upon a
sandy spit of rising ground Zzipp Pingjust by my left arm
The bullet struck a ledge of white rock with the now familiar metallic
tink

I went on moving quickly to get behind a thornbushthe only cover near
at hand Here at any rate I should be out of sight

Ping

Crackping

I could hear the report of the rifle I lay flat on my stomach
grovelled my face into the sandy soil and lay like a snake and as still
as a tortoise

I waited for about ten minutes It seemed an hour at least to me The
sniper did not shoot again In front of my thornbush was an open space
of pale yellow grass with no cover at all I crawled towards the
left flank and tried to creep slowly away I moved like the hands of
a clockso slowly about an inch at a time pushing forward like a
reptile on my stomach propelling myself only by digging my toes into
the earth My arms I kept stiff by my side my head well down

But the sniper away behind that little peartree which stood at the far
end of the open space had an eagle eye

Ping zzpp ping

I lay very still for a long time and then crept slowly back to my
thornbush

I tried the right flank but with the same effect And now he began
shooting through my thornbush on the chance of hitting me

Behind me was a dense undergrowth of thorn wildrose bramble thistle
willow and sage

I turned about and crawled through this tangle until at last I came
out scratched and dishevelled and sweating into the old watercourse

The firingline was only a few hundred yards away and the bullets from
a Turkish maxim went wailing over my head dropping far over by the
Engineers whom I had passed

I wanted to find those wounded and I wanted to get past that open
space and I wanted above all to dodge that sniper The old scouting
instincts of the primitive man came calling me to try my skill against
the skill of the Turk I sat there wiping away blood from the scratches
and sweat from my forehead and trying to think of a way through

I looked at the mountains on my leftthe lower ridge of the Kapanja
Sirtand saw how the watercourse went up and up and in and out and I
thought if I kept low and crawled round in this ditch I should come out
at last close behind the firingline and then I could get in touch with
the trenches I could hear the machinegun of the Ms rattling and
spitting

I began crawling along the watercourse I had only gone three yards or
so and turned a bend when I came suddenly upon two wounded men Both
quite youngone merely a boy He had a bad shrapnel wound through his
boot crushing the toes of his right foot The other lay groaning upon
his backwith a very bad shrapnel wound in his left arm The arm was
broken

The boy sat up and grinned when he saw me

Whats up asked his pal

Red Cross man says the boy and then Any water

Not a drop mate said I Been wounded long

Since yesterday evening says the boy

Been here all that time I asked It was now midafternoon

Yes couldnt get awayand he pointed to his foot

E carnt moveits is arm We crawled ere

Ill be back soon with stretchers and bandages I said and went
quickly back along the watercourse and then past the Engineers

Found em they asked

Yes getting stretchers up now said I Awful stink here Found any
dead I asked

Yes theres one or two round here We buried one over there yesterday
e fell ter bits when we moved im

I went on Soon I was back in the ditch beside the wounded men I had
successfully dodged the sniper by following along the bottom of the bed
of the stream With me I brought two stretchersquads and they had a
haversack containing as I thought splints and bandages But when
I opened it it had only some field dressings in it and some iodine
ampoules

I soon found that the mans arm was not only septic but broken and
splintered

Got a pair of scissors I asked

One man had a pair of nailscissors and with this very awkward
instrument I proceeded to operate It was a terrible gash His sleeve
was soaked in blood I cut it away and his shirt also

I broke an iodine phial and poured the yellow chemical into his great
gaping wound Actually his flesh stunk it was going bad

Is it broke he asked

Be all right in a few minutes nothing much I lied to him

Not broke then

Bit bent be all right

With the nailscissors I cut great chunks of his arm out and all
this flesh was gangrenous and mortification was rapidly spreading My
fingers were soaked in blood and iodine

I cut away a piece of muscle which stunk like bad meat

Can you feel that I asked

Feel what he murmured

I thought that might hurt I was cutting your sleeve away thats all

I cut out all the bad flesh almost to the broken bones I filled up
the jagged hole with another iodine ampoule I plugged the opening with
doublecyanide gauze and put on an antiseptic pad

Splints I asked

Havent any

So I used the helve of an entrenchingtool and the stalks of the willow
undergrowth

I set his arm straight and bandaged it tightly and fixed it absolutely
immovably Then we got him on a stretcher and they carried him three
and a half miles to our ambulance tents But Im afraid that arm had to
come off I never heard of him again

The other fellow was cheerful enough and only set his teeth and
drew his breath when I cut off his boot with a jackknife Wonderful
endurance some of these young fellows have Theres hope for England
yet




CHAPTER XV KANGAROO BEACH


 COMMUNICATIONS

 The native only needs a drum
 On which to thump his dusky thumb

 But WEthe Royal Engineers
 Must needs have carts and pontoonpiers
 Hundreds of miles of copperwire
 Fitted on poles to make it higher
 Hundreds of sappers lay it down
 And stick the poles up like a town
 By a wonderful system of dashes and dots
 Safe from the Turkish snipers shots
 We have as you see a marvellous trick
 Of sending messages doublequick
 You cant deny its a great erection
 Done by the 3rd Field Telegraph Section
 But somewhere
 THERES A DISCONNECTION

 The native merely thumps his drum
 He thumps it boldly thusTum Tum

 J H
 Sailing for Salonika


Kangaroo Beach was where the Australian bridgebuilding section had
their stores and dugouts

It was one muddle and confusion of watertanks pierplanks pontoons
huge piles of bullybeef biscuit and jam boxes Here we came each
evening with the watercart to get our supply of water and here the
watercarts of every unit came down each evening and stood in a row and
waited their turn The water was pumped from the watertank boats to the
tank on shore

The watertank boats brought it from Alexandria It was filthy water
full of dirt and very brackish to taste Also it was warm During the
two months at Suvla Bay I never tasted a drop of cold waterit was
always sickly lukewarm sunstewed

All day long high explosives used to sing and burstsometimes killing
and wounding men sometimes blowing up the bullybeef and biscuits
sometimes falling with a hiss and a column of white spray into the sea
It was here that the fieldtelegraph of the Royal Engineers became a
tangled spiders web of wires and cross wires They added wires and
branch wires every day and stuck them up on thin poles Here you could
see the Engineers in shirt and shorts trying to find a disconnection or
carrying a huge reel of wire Wooden shanties sprang up where dugouts
had been a day or so before Piers began to crawl out into the bay
adding a leg and trestle and pontoon every hour Near Kangaroo Beach was
the camp of the Indians and here you could see the dusky ones
praying on prayer mats and cooking rice and chupatties sort of
oatcakepancakes

Here they were laying a light rail from the beach up with trucks for
carrying shells and parts of big guns

Here was the field postoffice with sacks and sacks of letters and
parcels Some of the parcels were burst and unaddressed a pair of
socks or a mouldy homemade cake squashed in a cardboard boxsometimes
nothing but the brown paper card box and string an empty shellthe
contents having disappeared What happened to all the parcels which
never got to the Dardanelles no one knows but those which did arrive
were rifled and lost and stolen Parcels containing cigarettes had a
way of not getting delivered and cakes and sweets often fell out
mysteriously on the way from England




CHAPTER XVI THE ADVENTURE OF THE LOST SQUADS


Things became jumbled

The continual working up to the firingline and the awful labour of
carrying heavy men back to our dressing station it went on We got used
to being always tired and having only an hour or two of sleep It was
logheavy dreamless sleep sheer nothingness Just as tired when you
were wakened in the early hours by a sleepy grumbling guard And then
going round finding the men and wakening them up and getting them on
parade Every day the same late into the night

Then came the disappearance of a certain section of our ambulance and
the loss of an officer

This particular young lieutenant was left on Lemnos sick He really was
very sick indeed He recovered to some extent of the fever and joined
us one day at Suvla This was in the Old Dry Watercourse period when
Hawk and I lived in the bushgrown ditch

Officers NCOs and men were tired out with overwork This young
officer came up to the Kapanja Sirt to take over the next spell of duty

I remember him now pale and sickly with the fever still hanging on
him and dark sunken eyes He spoke in a dull lifeless way

Do you think youll be all right asked the adjutant

Yes I think so he answered

Well just stick here and send down the wounded as you find them Dont
go any farther along its too dangerous up thereyou understand

All right sir

It was only a stroke of luck that I didnt stay with him and his
stretchersquads

Youd better come down with me sergeant says the adjutant

Next day the news spread in that mysterious way which has always puzzled
me It spread as news does spread in the wild and desolate regions of
the earth

 lost all the lot

Who is

Up there Lieutenant S and the squads

Howjooknow

Just heardthat wounded fellow over there on the stretcher they
went out early this morning and theyve goneno sign never came back
at all

E warnt fit ter take charge e was ill you could see

Nice thing ter do The old manll go ravin mad

It was a ravin mad thing to put the poor feller in charge 

Dont criticise yer officers said some wit quoting the Army
Regulations

The adjutant and a string of squads turned out and we went back again
to the spot where we had left the young officer the evening before

The cook and an orderly man remained and we heard from them the details
of the mystery

Early that morning they had formed up and gone off under Lieutenant
S along the mule track overlooking the Gulf of Saros That was all
There was still hope of course but there wasnt a sign of them to
be seen The machinegun section had seen them pass right along Some
officers had warned them not to go up but they went and they never came
back

There were rumours that one of the NCOs of the party a sergeant
had been seen lying on some rocks

Just riddled with bulletsriddled

The hours dragged on I begged of the adjutant to let me go off along
the ridge on my own to see if I could find any trace

Its too dangerous he said If I thought there was half a chance Id
go with you but we dont want to lose any more

Those ten or twelve men went out of our lives completely Days passed
There was no news It was queer It was queer when I called the roll
next day

BriggsSarnt

BootsSarnt

CudworthHere Sarnt

DeanSarnt

DesmondSarnt

D

I couldnt remember not to call his name out It seemed queer that he
was missing It seemed quite hopeless now Three or four days dragged
on Everything continued as usual We went up past the place where we
had left them and there was no news no sign They just vanished No
one saw them again and except for the riddled rumour of the poor old
sergeant the whole thing was a blank

We supposed that the young officer coming fresh to the place did not
know where the British lines ended and the Turks began and he marched
his squads into that bit of No Mans Land beyond the machinegun near
Jeffersons Post and was either shot or taken prisoner

It made the men heavy and sadminded

Poor old Mellore warnt a bad sort was he

Ahan Bell Sergeant Bell riddled they say some one seen
martillery or some one

It hung over them like a cloud The men talked of nothing else

Somebodys blundered said one

Its a pity anyow

Its a disgrace to the ambulancelosin men like that

And also it made the men nervous and unreliable It was a shock




CHAPTER XVII OH TO BE IN ENGLAND


It may be that I have never grown up properly Im a very poor hand at
pretending Im a grown man

Impressions of small queer things still stamp themselves with a clear
kodakclick on my mindan ivorywhite mules skull lying in the sand
with green beetles running through the eyeholes anythingtrivial
childlike details

I remember reading an article in a magazine which stated that under
fire and more especially in a charge a man moves in a whirl of
excitement which blots out all the small realities around him all the
local colour He remembers nothing but a wild mad rush or the tense
intensity of the danger he is in

It is not so The greater the danger and the more exciting the position
the more intensely does the mind receive the imprint of tiny commonplace
objects

Memories of Egypt and the Mediterranean are far more a jumble of general
effects of colour sound and smell

The closer we crept to the shores of Suvla Bay and the deathbed of the
Salt Lake the more exact and vivid are the impressions the one is like
an impressionist sketchblobs and dabs and great sloshy washes but the
memories of Peartree Gully of the Kapanja Sirt and Chocolate Hill
are drawn in with a fine mapping pen and Indian inklike a Rackham
fairybook illustrationevery blade of dead grass every ripple of
blue every pink pebble and towards the firingline I could draw it
now every inch of the way up the hills with every stone and jagged rock
in the right place

Before sailing from England I had bought a little colourbox one good
sable brush and a few HB pencilsthese and a sketchbook which my
father gave me I carried everywhere in my haversack The pocketbook was
specially made with paper which would take pencil colour crayon ink
or charcoal I was always on the look out for sketches and notes The
cover bore the strange device

flyleaf I had written

And on the opposite page I wrote

 IN CASE OF DEATH please post as soon as possible to

 GORDON HARGRAVE
 Cinderbarrow Cottage
 Levens
 Westmorland

I remember printing the word DEATH and wondering if the book would
some day lie with my own dead body somewhere in the Dardanelles
Printing that word in England before we started made the whole thing
seem very real Somehow up to then I hadnt realised that I might get
killed quite easily I hadnt troubled to think about it

We moved our camp from A Beach farther along towards the Salt Lake We
moved several times Always Hawk and I hung together Once he was very
ill in the old driedup watercourse which wriggled down from the Kislar
Dargh He ate nothing for three days I never saw anything like it
before He was as weak as a rat and I know he came very near pegging
out He felt it himself I was sitting on the ground near by

I may not pull through this old fellow says Hawk with just a
tearglint under one eyelid He lay under a shelf of rock safe from
shrapnel

Come now Fred says I youre not going to snuff it yet

Weak as a ratcant eat nothink PRACtically nothink but see here
Johnhe seldom called me Johnif I do slip off the map an I
feel PRACtically done for this timeif I SHOULDyou see that
rationbaghe pointed to a little white bag bulging and tied up and
knotted

Yes

Its got some little things in itfor the kiddies at homea little
teapot I found up by the Turkish bivouac over there and one or two more
relicsI want em to have emwill you take care of it and send it
home for me if you get out of this alive

Of course I promised to do this but tried to cheer him up and assured
him he would soon pull round

In a few days he threw off the fever and was about again

Hawk and I had lived for some weeks in this overgrown watercourse
It was a natural trench and at one place Hawk had made a dugout He
picked and shovelled right into the hard sandy rock until there was
quite a goodsized little cave about eight feet long and five deep

The same sickness got me It came over me quite suddenly I was
fearfully tired Every limb ached and like all the others I began to
develop what I call the stretcherstoop I just lay down in the
ditch with a blanket and went to sleep Hawk sat over me and brought me
bovril which we had pinched on Lemnos Island

I felt absolutely dying and I really wondered whether I should have
enough strength to throw the sickness off as Hawk had I gave him just
the same sort of instructions about my notes and sketches as he had
given me about his little rationbag

Get em back to England if you can I said youre the man Id
soonest trust here

If Hawk hadnt looked after me and made me eat I dont believe I should
have lived I used to lie there looking at the wildrose tangles and the
red hips there were brambles too with poor driedup blackberries It
reminded me of England Little green lizards scuttled about and great
black centipedes crawled under my blanket The sun was blazing
at midday Hawk used to rig me up an awning over the ditch with
willowstems and a waterproof groundsheet

Somehow you always thought yourself back to England No matter what
train of thought you went upon it always worked its way by one thread
or another to England Mine did anyway

It was better to be up with the stretchersquads in the firing line than
lying there sick and thinking those long long thoughts

This is how I would think

What a waste of life what a waste Christianity this all part
of civilisation whats it all for Queer thing this civilised
Christianity very queer So this really IS war see now how does
it feel not much different to usual But why Its getting awfully
sickening plenty of excitement tooplenty too much in fact
very easy to get killed any time here plenty of men getting killed
every minute over there but it isnt really very exciting not like I
thought war was in England England Long way off England thousands
of miles they dont know Im sick in England wonder what theyd think
to see me now not a bad place England green trees and green grass
much better place than I thought it was wonder how long this will hang
on Id like to get back after its finished here I expect its all
going on just the same in England people going about to offices in
London women dressing themselves up and shopping and all that
This is a dplace this beastly peninsulano green anywhere just
yellow sand and grey rocks and sagecoloured bushes dead grasseven
the thistles are all bleached and dead and rustling in the breeze like
paper flowers

And we WANTED to get out here Just eating our hearts out to get into
it all to get to workand now were all sick of it its rotten
absolutely rotten everything Its a rotten war Wonder what they are
doing now at home




CHAPTER XVIII TWO MEN RETURN


I shall never forget those two little figures coming into camp

They were both trembling like aspen leaves One had ginger hair and a
crop of ginger beard bristled on his chin Their eyes were hollow and
sunken and glittered and roamed unmeaningly with the glare of insanity
They glanced with a horrible suspicion at their pals and knew them not
The one with the ginger stubble muttered to himself Their clothes were
torn with brambles and prickles from thornbushes still clung round
their puttees A pitiful sight They tottered along keeping close
together and avoiding the others An awful tiredness weighed upon them
they dragged themselves along Their lips were cracked and swollen and
dry They had lost their helmets and the sun had scorched and peeled
the back of their necks Their hair was matted and full of sand But the
fear which looked out of those glinting eyes was terrible to behold

We gave them Oxo and the medical officer came and looked at them
They came down to our driedup watercourse and tried to sleep but they
were past sleep They kept dozing off and waking up with a start and
muttering

 All gone killed where where No no No  dont move
mumblemumble keep still idiot youll get shot can you see
them Eh where hes dying dying stop the bleeding man Hes
dying were all dying no water drink

Ive seen men healthy strong hardfaced Irishmen blown to shreds
Ive helped to clear up the mess Ive trod on dead mens chests in the
sand and the ribs have bent in and the putrid gases of decay have burst
through with a whhhhfff

But Id rather have to deal with the dead and dying than a case of
snipermadness

I was just recovering from that attack of fever and dysentery and these
two were lying beside me the one mumbling and the other panting in a
fitful sleep

When they were questioned they could give very little information

Wheres Lieutenant S

 Gone theyre all gone

How far did you go with him

No answer

Where are the others

 Gone theyre all gone

Are they killed

 Gone

Are any of the others alive

We got away theyre lost dead I think

Did you come straight backits a week since you were lost

Its days and days and long nights couldnt move couldnt move an
inch and poor old George dying under a rock no cover and they shot
at us if we moved we waved the stretchers when we found wed got too
far too far we got too far much too far shot at us

What about the sergeant

We got cut off cut off we tried to crawl away at night by
rolling over and over down the hill and creeping round bushes always
creeping an crawling but it took us two days and two nights to
get away crawling creeping and crawling an they kep firing at
us

No food we chewed grass sucked dead grass to get some spittle
an sometimes we tried to eat grass to fill up a bit  no food no
water

They were complete wrecks They couldnt keep their limbs still They
trembled and shook as they lay there

Their ribs were standing out like skeletons and their stomachs had
sunken in They were black with sunburn and filthily dirty

Gradually they got better The glare of insanity became less obvious
but a certain haunted look never left them They were broken men Months
afterwards they mumbled to themselves in the nighttime

Nolan one of the seafaring men of my section who was with the lost
squads also returned but he had not suffered so badly or at any rate
he had been able to stand the strain better

It was about this time that we began to realise that the new landing had
been a failure It was becoming a stalemate It was like a clock with
its hands stuck The whole thing went ticking on every day but there
was no progressnothing gained And while we waited there the Turks
brought up heavy guns and fresh troops on the hills They consolidated
their positions in a great semicircle all round usand we just held the
bay and the Salt Lake and the Kapanja Sirt

So all this seemed sheer waste Thousands of lives wastedthousands
of armless and legless cripples sent backfor nothing The troops soon
realised that it was now hopeless You cant kid a great body of men
for long It became utterly sickeningthe inactivitythe waitingfor
nothing And every day we lost men Men were killed by snipers as they
went up to the trenches The Turkish snipers killed them when they went
down to the wells for water

The whole thing had lost impetus It came to a standstill It kept on
marking time and nothing appeared to move it

In the first three days of the landing it wanted but one thing to have
marched us right through to Constantinopleit wanted dash

It didnt want a careful thoughtful man in commandit wanted dash and
bluff It could have been done in those early days The landing WAS a
successa brilliant blinding successbut it stuck at the very
moment when it should have rushed forward It was no ones fault if you
understand It was sheer luck It just didnt come offand only just
But a man with dash a devilmaycare sort of leader could have cut
right across on Sunday August the 8th and brought off a staggering
victory




CHAPTER XIX THE RETREAT


It happened on the left of Peartree Gully

Peartree Gully was a piece of ground which neither we nor the Turks
could hold It was a gap in both lines swept by machinegun fire and
haunted by snipers and sharpshooters

We had advanced right up behind the machinegun section which was
hidden in a dense clump of bushes on the top of a steep rise

The sun was blazing hot and the sweat was dripping from our faces We
were continually on the lookout for wounded and always alert for the
agonised cry of Stretcherbearers away on some distant knoll or down
below in the thickets Looking back the bay shimmered a silverwhite
streak with grey battleships lying out

In front the fighting broke out in fierce gusts

PoppoppoppopPoppop went the machinegun We could see one man
getting another belt of ammunition ready to feed Bullets from
the Turkish quickfirers went singing with an angry ssssooooo
zzzzeeee whheeeooooo zzing

Dyou know where Brigade Headquarters is asked the adjutant

Ill find it sir

Very well go up with this message and I shall be here when you come
back

I took the message saluted and went off plunging down into the
thickets and at last along my old watercourse where I had crawled away
from the sniper some days before

I made a big detour to avoid showing myself on the skyline I knew the
general direction of our Brigade Headquarters and after halfanhours
steady trudging with various creepings and crawlings I arrived and
delivered my message I returned quickly towards Peartree Gully I
stopped once to listen for the Poppoppop of our machinegun but I
could not hear it I hurried on It was downhill most of the way going
back I crept up through the bushes and looked about for signs of our
men and the officer

I saw a man of the machinegun section carrying the tripodstand
followed by another with the ammunitionbeltbox

Seen any Medical Corps here

Theyve gone downooked it youd better get out o this quick
yourselfwere retreatingcant old this place noowtoo ot

Did the officer leave any message

Notheyve bin gone some timecome on Sammy

Well I thought to myself this IS nice So I went down with the
machinegunners and in the dead grass just below the gully I found a
wounded man he was shot through the thigh and it had gone clean through
both legs

He was bleeding to death quickly for it had ripped both arteries
Looking round I saw another man coming down hopping along but very
cheerful

In the ankle he said can you do anything

Ill have a look in a minute

I examined the man who was hit in the thigh and discovered two
tourniquets had been applied made out of a handkerchief and bits of
stick to twist them up But the blood was now pumping steadily from both
wounds and soaking its way into the sandy soil I tightened them up but
it was useless There was no stopping the loss of blood

All the time little groups of British went straggling pasthurrying
back towards the bayretreating

It was impossible to leave my wounded I helped the cheerful man to hop
near a willow thicket and there I took off his boot and found a clean
bullet wound right through the anklebone of the left foot It was
bleeding slowly and the man was very pale

Been bleeding long I asked

About half an hour I reckon Is it all right mate

Yes Its a clean wound

I plugged each hole padded it and bound it up tightly I had a look
at the other man who was still bleeding and had lost consciousness
altogether

It was a race for life Which to attend to Both men were still
bleeding and both would bleed to death within half an hour or so I
reckoned it was almost hopeless with the tourniquetman and I left him
passing painlessly from life to death But the anklemans wound was
still bleeding when I turned again to him It trickled through my
plugging Its a difficult thing to stop the bleeding from such a place
Seeing the plug was useless I tried another way I rolled up one of
his puttees put it under his knee braced his knee up and tied it in
position with the other puttee This brought pressure on the artery
itself and stopped the loss of blood from his ankle I could hear the
Turkish machinegun much closer now It sputtered out a leaden rain with
a hard metallic clatter

Thanks mate said the man ows the other bloke

Hes all right I answered and I could see him lying a little way up
the hill calm and still and stiffening

I found two regimental stretcherbearers coming down with the rest in
this little retreat and I got them to take my ankleman on to their
dressing station about two miles further back

Its no fun attending to wounded when the troops are retiring

Next day they regained the lost position and I trudged past the poor
dead body of the man who had bled to death The tourniquets were still
gripping his lifeless limbs and the blood on the handkerchiefs had dried
a rich redbrown




CHAPTER XX JHILLO JOHNNIE


 A BEACH

 SUVLA BAY

 Theres a lot of senseless doing
 And a fearful lot of work
 There are gangs of men with gangers
 To see they do not shirk
 Theres the usual waste of power
 In the usual Western way
 Theres a tangle in the transport
 And a blockage every day
 The sergeants do the swearing
 The corporals carry on
 The private cusses openly
 And hopes hell soon be gone


One evening the colonel sent me from our dugout near the Salt Lake to
A Beach to make a report on the water supply which was pumped ashore
from the tankboats I trudged along the sandy shore At one spot I
remember the carcase of a mule washed up by the tide the flesh rotted
and sodden and here and there a yellow rib bursting through the skin
Its head floated in the water and nodded to and fro with a most uncanny
motion with every ripple of the bay

The wet season was coming on and the chill winds went through my
khaki drill uniform The sky was overcast and the bay generally a
kaleidoscope of Eastern blues and greens was dull and grey

At A Beach I examined the pipes and tanks of the watersupply system
and had a chat with the Australians who were in charge I drew a small
plan showing how the water was pumped from the tanks afloat to the
standing tank ashore and suggested the probable cause of the sand and
dirt of which the CO complained

This done I found our own ambulance watercart just ready to return to
our camp with its nightly supply Evening was giving place to darkness
and soon the misty hills and the bay were enveloped in starless gloom

The traffic about A Beach was always congested It reminded you of the
Bank and the Mansion House crush far away in London town

Here were clanking watercarts dozens of them waiting in their turn
stamping mules and snorting horses here were motortransport wagons
with WD in white on their grey sides ambulance wagons jolting
slowly back to their respective units sometimes full of wounded
sometimes empty Here all was bustle and noise Sergeants shouting and
corporals cursing transportofficers giving directions a party of New
Zealand sharpshooters in scout hats and leggings laughing and yarning
a patrol of the REs Telegraph Section coming in after repairing the
wires along the beach or a new batch of men just arrived falling in
with newlooking kitbags

It was through this throng of seething khaki and transport traffic that
our watercart jostled and pushed

Often we had to pull up to let the Indian Packmule Corps pass and it
was at one of these halts that I happened to come close to one of these
dusky soldiers waiting calmly by the side of his mules

I wished I had some knowledge of Hindustani and began to think over any
words he might recognise

You ever hear of Rabindranarth Tagore Johnnie I asked him The name
of the great writer came to mind

He shook his head No sergeant he answered

Buddha Johnnie His face gleamed and he showed his great white teeth

No Buddie

Mahomet Johnnie

Yesme Mahommedie he said proudly

Gunga Johnnie I asked remembering the name of the sacred river
Ganges from Kiplings Kim

No Gunga sabMahommedie me

You go Benares Johnnie

No Benares

Mecca

Mokka yes afterwards me go Mokka

After the war you going to Mokka Johnnie

Yes Indee FrancehereIndee back againthen Mokka

You been to France Johnnie

Yes sab

You know Kashmir Johnnie

Kashmir my house he replied

You live in Kashmir

Yes you go Indee sergeant

No Ive never been

No go Indee

Not yet

Indee very goodEnglish very goodTurk finish

With a sudden jerk and a rattle of chains our watercart mules pulled
out on the trail again and the ghostly figure with its wellfolded
turban and gleaming white teeth was left behind

A beautifully calm race the Hindus They did wonderful work at Suvla
Bay Up and down up and down hour after hour they worked steadily on
taking up biscuits bullybeef and ammunition to the firingline and
returning for more and still more Day and night these splendidly built
Easterns kept up the supply

I remember one man who had had his left leg blown off by shrapnel
sitting on a rock smoking a cigarette and great tears rolling down his
cheeks But he said no word Not a groan or a cry of pain

They ate little and said little But they were always extraordinarily
polite and courteous to each other They never neglected their prayers
even under heavy shell fire

Once when we were moving from the Salt Lake to C Beach Lala Baba
the Indians moved all our equipment in their little twowheeled carts

They were much amused and interested in our sergeant clerk who stood 6
feet 8 inches They were joking and pointing to him in a little bunch

Going up to them I pointed up to the sky and then to the Sergeant
saying Himalayas Johnnie

They roared with laughter and ever afterwards called him Himalayas

CHAPTER XXI SILVER BAY


On the edge of the Salt Lake by the blue Aegean shore Hawk and I dug a
little underground home into the sandy hillock upon which our ambulance
was now encamped

Im going deep into this said Hawkhe was a very skilful miner and
he knew his work

None of your dead heroes for me he said I dont hold with
emwell make it PRACtically shellproof We did Each day we
burrowed into the soft sandy layers he swinging the pick and I filling
up sandbags At last we made a sort of cave a snug little Peter Pan
home sandbagged all round and safe from shells when you crawled in

I often thought what a fine thing Stevenson would have written from the
local colour of the bay

Its changing colours were intense and wonderful In the early morning
the waves were a rich royal blue with splashing lines of white breakers
rolling in and in upon the pale grey sand and the seabirds skimming
and wheeling overhead

At midday it was colourless glaring steelflashing with the sunlight
blazing and everything shimmering in the heat haze

In the early afternoon when Hawk and I used to go down to the shore and
strip naked like savages and plunge into the warm water the bay had
changed to pale blue with green ripples and the outline of Imbros
Island on the horizon was a long jagged strip of mauve

Later when the sunset sky turned lemonyellow orange and deep
crimson the bay went into peacock blues and purples with here and
there a current of bottleglass green and Imbros Island stood clear cut
against the sunsetcolour a violetblack silhouette

Queer creatures crept across the sands and into the old Turkish snipers
trenches long black centipedes sandbirdsvery much resembling
our martin but with something of the canary in their colour Horned
beetles baby tortoises mice and greengrey lizards all left their
tiny footprints on the shore

If this silver sand was only in England a man could make his fortune
said Hawk We wept like anything to see

I never saw such white sand before One had to misquote Come unto
these SILVER sands It glittered white in a great horseshoe round the
bay and the bed of the Salt Lake which is really an overflow from the
sea was a barren patch of this silversand with here and there a dead
mule or a snipers body lying out a little black blot the haunt of
vultures

I made some careful drawings of the sandtracks of the bay noting down
tracks being a habit with the scout

In these things Hawk was always interested and often a great help for
in spite of his fifty years and his buccaneerishhabits he was at heart
a boya boyscout in fact and a fine tracker

One of the most picturesque sights I ever saw was an Indian officer
mounted on a white Arab horse with a long flowing mane and a tail which
swept in a splendid curve and trailed in the sands The Hindu wore a
khaki turban with a long end floating behind He sat his horse bolt
upright and rode in the proper military style

The Arab steed pranced and arched its great neck With the blue of
the bay as a background it made a magnificent picture worthy of the
ThousandandOne Nights

Day by day we improved our dugout going deeper into the solid rock
and putting up an awning in front made of two army blankets with a
wooden crossbeam roped to an old rusty bayonet driven into the sand

We lived a truly Robinson Crusoe life with the addition of Turkish
highexplosives and bullybeefandbiscuit stew

Our dugout was back to the firingline and at night we looked out
upon the bay We lay in our blankets watching the white moonlight on the
waves and the black shadows of our ambulance wagons on the silver sand

It was in this dugout that Hawk used to cook the most wonderful dishes
on a Primus stove

The language was thick and terrible when that stove refused to work
and Hawk would squat there cursing and cleaning it and sticking bits of
wire down the gastube

He cooked chocolatepudding and riceandmilk and
arrowrootblancmange stewed prunes fried bread in bacon fat and many
other tasty morsels

The proof of a good cook said Hawk is whether he can make a meal
worth eating out of PRACtically nothinkand he could

There were very few wounds now to attend to in the hospital dugout
Mostly we got men with sandflyfever and dysentery men with scabies and
lice men utterly and unspeakably exhausted with hollow blackrimmed
eyes cracked lips and footsores men who limped across the sandy
bed dragging their rifles and equipment in their hands men who were
desperately hungry whose eyes held the glint of snipermadness men
whose bodies were wasting away the skin taut and dry like a drum with
every rib showing like the beams of a wreck or the rafters of an old
roof

Always we were in the midst of pain and misery hunger and death We do
not get much of the rush and glory of battle in the Linseed Lancers
We deal with the wreckage thrown up by the tide of battle and wreckage
is always a sad sighthuman wreckage most of all

But the bay was always full of interest for me with its everchanging
colour and the imprint of the ripples in the gleaming silversand

And the silver moonlight silvers the silversand while the skeletons
of the Xth sink deeper and deeper to be rediscovered perhaps at some
future geological period and recognised as a type of primitive man




CHAPTER XXII DUGOUT YARNS


 Oft in the stilly night
 By yellow candlelight
 With finger in the sand
 We mapped and planned

 This is the Turkish well
 Thats where the Captain fell
 Theres the great Salt Lake bed
 Heres where the Munsters led

 Primitive man arose
 With prehistoric pose
 Like Dugout Men of old
 By signs our thoughts were told

I have slept and lived in every kind of camp and bivouac I have dug and
helped to dig dugouts I have lain full length in the dry dead grass
under the wide and starry sky I have crept behind a ledge of rock
and gone to sleep with the ants crawling over me I have slept with a
pair of boots for a pillow I have lived and snoozed in the driedup bed
of a mountain torrent for weeks A groundsheet tied to a bough has been
my bedroom I have slumbered curled in a coil of rope on the deck of a
cattleboat in an ambulance wagon on a stretcher in farmhouse barns
and under hedges and haystacks I have slept in the sand by the blue
Mediterranean Sea with the crickets and grasshoppers zipping and
zinging all night long

But our dugout nights on the edge of the bay at Buccaneer Bivouac were
the most enjoyable

It was here of a nighttime that Hawk and Isometimes alone sometimes
with Brockley or Cherry Blossom or Corporal Mush or Sergeant Joe
Smith the sailormen as onlookers and listenersit was here we drew
diagrams in the sand with our fingers and talked on politics and
womens rights marriage and immorality drink and religion customs and
habits of life and death peace and war

Sometimes Hawk burst into a rare phrase of splendid
compositionwellbalanced rhetoric not unworthy of a Prime Minister

At other times he is the buccaneer the flinger of foul oaths and
terrible damning curses But as a rule they are not vindictive they
have no stingfor Hawk is a forgiving and humble man in reality in
spite of his mask of arrogance

A remarkable character in every way he fell unknowingly into the old
northcountry Quaker talk of thee and thou

Another minute he gives an order in those hard calm commanding words
which had he had the chance would have made him in spite of his lack
of schooling one of the finest Generals the world could ever know

On these occasional gleams of pure leadership he finds the finest Kings
English ready to his lips while at other times he is ungrammatical
ordinary but never uninteresting or slow of intuition

He was a master of slang and like all strong and vivid characters had
his own peculiar sayings

He never thought of looking over my shoulder when I was sketching He
was a gentleman of Nature But when he saw I had finished his clear
deepset eyes handed down to him from those old Norseman ancestors
would glint with interest

Dekko the drawing he would say using the old Romany word for lets
see

PRACtically was a favourite word

PRACtically the ole Peninsula

PRACtically every one of em

It werent that he would say or I werent bothering

Im not bothered

Thee neednt bother but its a misfortunate thing

Hates me like the divil ates Holy Water

Like enough

A pound to a penny

As like as not

Ah very like

These were all typical Hawkish expressions

His yarns of India outRudyard Kipling They were superb full of
barrackroom touches and the smells and sounds of the jungle He told
of the time when a soldier could get jungling leave when he could
go off with a Winchester and a pal and a native guide for two or three
months when the Government paid so many rupees for a tiger skin so
many for a cobraa scale of rewards for bringing back the trophies of
the jungle wilds

He pictured the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush describing the everlasting
snows where you look up and up at the sheer rocks and glaciers you
feel like a baby tortoise away down there so small as like as not you
get giddy and drunklike

One night Hawk told me of a Hindu fakir who sat by the roadside
performing the mangotrick for one anna I illustrated it in the sand as
he told it

_caption Dugout September 9 1915_

1 The fakir puts a pinch of dust from the ground in a little pile on a
glass plate on a tripod

2 He covers it up with a handkerchief or a cloth

3 He plays the bagpipes or a wooden flute while you can see the heap
of dust under the cloth agrowing and agrowing up and up bigger and
bigger

4 At last he lifts up the cloth and shows you the green mangotree
growing on the piece of glass

He covers it againplays Lifts the cloth shows you the mango tree in
leaf Covers it againplays again Takes away the cloth and shows you
the mangotree in fruit real fruit but they never let you have the
fruit for love or money Rather than let any one have it they pluck it
and squash it between their fingers




CHAPTER XXIII THE WISDOM OF FATHER S


One day while I was making some sketchbook drawings of bursting shells
down in the old watercourse the Roman Catholic padre came along

Sketching Hargrave

Yes sir

And then I suppose youre Church of England arent you

No sir Im down as Quaker

Quaker ehthats interesting I know quite a lot of Quakers in
Dublin and Belfast

Who would expect to find Father Brown of G K Chesterton fame in a
khaki drill uniform and a pith helmet

A small energetic man with a round face and a habit of putting his
hands deep into the patch pockets of his tunic Here was a priest who
knew his people who was a real father to his khaki followers I
quickly discovered him to be a man of learning and one who noticed
small signs and commonplace details

His eyes twinkled and glittered when he was amused and his little round
face wrinkled into wreaths of smiles

When we moved to the Salt Lake dugouts he came with us and here he had
a dugout of his own

When the days work was finished and the moonlight glittered white
across the Salt Lake I used to stroll away for a time by myself before
turning in

It was a good time to think Everything was so silent Even my own
footsteps were soundless in the soft sand It was on one of these
nightprowls that I spotted the tiny figure of Father S jerking
across the sands with that wellknown energetic walk stick in hand

Stars Hargrave said the little priest

Very clear tonight sir

Queer you know Hargrave to think that those same old stars have
looked down all these ages same old stars which looked down on Darius
and his Persians

He prodded the sand with his walking stick stuck his cap on one side I
dont think he cared for his helmet and peered up to the starspangled
sky

Wonderful country all this said the padre it may be across this
very Salt Lake that the armies of the ancients fought with sling and
stone and spear St Paul may have put in here he was well acquainted
with these partsLemnos and all round aboutpreaching and teaching on
his travels you know

Talking about Lemnos Island he went on did you notice the series of
peaks which run across it in a line

Yes

Well it was on those promontories that Agamemnon King of Mycenae lit
a chain of firebeacons to announce the taking of Troy to his Queen
Clytaemnestra at Argos

Here the little priest as pleased as a schoolboy scratched a rough
sketch map in the sand

All the islands round here are full of historical interest you know
farfamed Samothrace for instance Father S talked much of
classical history connecting these islands with Greek and Roman heroes

All this was desperately interesting to me It was picturesque to stand
in the sandbed of the Salt Lake lit by the broad flood of silver
moonlight with the little priest eagerly scratching like an ibis in the
sand with his walkingstick

I learnt more about the Near East in those few minutes than I had ever
done at school

But besides the interest in this novel history lesson I was more than
delighted to find the padre so correct in his sketch of the island and
the coast and I took down what he told me in a notebook afterwards
and copied his sandmaps also

After this I came to know him better than I had I visited his dugout
and he let me look at his books and Punch and a monthold Illustrated
London News or so I came to admire him for his simplicity and for his
devotion to his men Every Sunday he held Mass in the trenches of the
firingline and he never had the least fear of going up

A splendid little man always cheerful always looking after his
flock Praying with those who were about to give up the ghost
administering the last rites of the Church to those who in awful agony
were fluttering like singed moths at the edge of the great flame the
Great LifeMystery of Death

He wrote beautifully sad letters of comfort to the mothers of
boyofficers who were killed Father S knew every man every man knew
Father S and admired him

His dugout was made in a slope overlooking the bay and was really
a deep square pit in the sandbank roofed with corrugated iron and
sandbagged all round Here we talked I found he knew G K C and
Hilaire Belloc Always he wanted to look at any new drawings in my
sketchbooks

It is a relief to speak with some intelligent person sometimes

Such was Father S a very cute little man knowing most of the
troubles of the men about him noticing their ways and keeping in touch
with them all




CHAPTER XXIV THE SHARPSHOOTERS


Just after the episode of the lost squads we were working our
stretcherbearers as far as Brigade Headquarters which were situated on
a steep backbonelike spur of the Kapanja Sirt

One of my lancejacks lancecorporals had been missing for a good
long time and we began to fear he was either shot or taken prisoner
with the others who had gone too far up the Sirt

One afternoon we were resting among the rocks waiting for wounded to be
sent back to us for since the loss of the others we were not allowed
to pass the Brigade Headquarters There was a lull in the fighting with
only a few bursting shrapnel now and then

This particular lancejack was quite a young lad of the middleclass
with a fairly good education

But he was a weedy specimen physically and I doubted whether he could
pull through if escape should mean a fight with Nature for food and
water and life itself

Fairly late in the day as we all lay sprawling on the rocks or under the
thornbushes I saw a little party staggering along the defile which led
up to the Sirt at this point

There were two men with cowboy hats and between them they helped
another very thin and very exhaustedlooking fellow who tottered along
holding one arm which had been wounded

As they came closer I recognised my lost lancejack very pale and
shaky a little thinner than usual and with a hint of that gleam of
snipermadness which I have noticed before in the jumpy unsteady eyes
of hunted men

The other two one each side were sturdy enough Wellbuilt men one
short and the other tall with great rough hands sunburnt faces
and bare arms They wore brown leggings and ridingbreeches and khaki
shirts They carried their rifles at the trail and strode up to us with
the graceful gait of those accustomed to the outdoor life

Awstralians said some one

An the corporal

Immediately our men roused up and gathered round

Wheres yer boss asked the tall Colonial

The adjutant is over here I answered

Wed like a word with him continued the man I took them up to the
officer and they both saluted in an easygoing sort of way

We found im up there the Australian jerked his head being sniped
and couldnt git awaysays e belongs t th 32nd Ambulanceso here he
is

The two Australians were just about to slouch off again when the
adjutant called them back

Where did you find him he asked

Up beyond Jeffersons Post there was five snipers pottin at im an
it looked mighty like as if is number was up We killed four o the
snipers and got him out

That was very good of you Did you see any more Medical Corps up there
Weve lost some others and an officer and sergeant

No I didnt spot anydid you Bill The tall man turned to his pal
leaning on his rifle

No answered the short sharpshooter hes the only one It was a
good afternoons sportvery good We saw ed got no rifle and was in
a tight cloveitch so we took the job on right there an finished four
of em but it took some creepin and crawlin

Well well be quittin this now said the tall one Theres only
one thing wed ask of you sir dont let our people know anything about
this

But why asked the adjutant astonished Youve saved his life and
it ought to be known

Yaas that may be sir but were not supposed to be up here
sharpshootinwe jist done it fer a bit of sport Rightly we dont
carry a rifle we belong to the bridgebuildin section Weve only
borrowed these rifles from the Cycle Corps an we shall be charged with
bein out o bounds without leave an all that sort o thing if it gits
known down at our headquarters

Very well Ill tell no one all the same it was good work and we
thank you for getting him back to us the adjutant smiled

The two Australians gave him a friendly nod and said So long you
chaps to us and lurched off down the defile

Well chuck it fer todaydone enough said the tall man

Yaas wed better git back It was good sportvery good said the
short one

Certainly the Australians we met were a cheerful happygolucky
devilmaycare crew They were the most picturesque set of men on the
peninsula

Rough travelling little or no food no water sleepless nights
and thrilling escapes made them look queerly primitive and Robinson
Crusoeish

I wrote in my pocketbook September 8 1915The Australians have the
keen eye quick ear and silent tongue which evolves in the bushman and
those who have faced starvation and the constant risk of sudden death
who have lived a hard life on the hard ground like the animals of the
wild and come through

Fine fellows these with good chests and arms wellknit and gracefully
poised by habitually having to creep and crouch and run and fight
Sunburnt to a deep bronze one and all

Their khaki shorts flap and ripple in the seawind like a troop of Boy
Scouts Some wear green shirts and they all wear stonegray wideawake
hats with pinched crown and broad flat brims

When at last the mails brought us monthold papers from England we read
that The gallant Australians at Suvla took Lala Baba and Chocolate
Hill indeed as Hawk read out in our dugout one mailday

The Australians have took everythink or practically everythink worth
takin They stormed Lala Baba and captured Chocolate illin fac
they made the landin and the Xth and XIth Divisions are simply a myth
accordin to the papers




CHAPTER XXV A SCOUT AT SUVLA BAY


Many times have I seen the value of the Scout training but never was
it demonstrated so clearly as at Suvla Bay Here owing to the rugged
nature of the countrydevoid of all signs of civilisationa barren
sandy wasteit was necessary to practise all the cunning and craft of
the savage scout Therefore those who had from boyhood been trained in
scouting and scoutcraft came out topdog

And whybecause here we were working against men who were born scouts

It became necessary to be able to find your way at night by the stars
You were not allowed to strike a light to look at a map and anyhow the
maps we had were on too small a scale to be of any real use locally

Now a great many officers were unable to find even the North Star
Perhaps in civil life they had been men who laughed at the boy scout in
his shirt and shorts because they couldnt see the good of it But when
we came face to face with bare Nature we had to return to the methods of
primitive man

More than once I found it very useful to be able to judge the time by
the swing of the starsky

Then again many and many a young officer or armyscout on outpost duty
was shot and killed because instead of keeping still he jerked his
head up above the rocks and finding himself spotted jerked down again
The consequence was that when he raised himself the next time the Turks
had the spot taped and his number was up

This means unnecessary loss of men owing entirely to lack of training
in scoutcraft and stalking

Finding your way was another point How many companies got cut
up simply because the officer or sergeant in charge had no bump of
location As most men came from our big cities and towns they knew
nothing of spotting the trail or of guessing the right direction
Indeed I see Sir Ian Hamilton states that owing to one battalion
losing its way a most important position was lostand this happened
again and againsimply because the leaders were not scouts

Then there were many young officers who when it came to the test could
not read a map quickly as they went Boy scouts please note
This became a very serious thing when taking up fresh men into the
firingline

Those men who went out with a lot of ladida swank soon found that
they were nowhere in the game with the man who cut his drill trousers
into shortswent about with his shirt sleeves rolled up and didnt mind
getting himself dirty

There were very few knuts and they soon got cracked

Shouting and talking was another point in scouting at Suvla Bay Brought
up in towns and streets many men found it extremely difficult to keep
quiet Slowly they learnt that silence was the only protection against
the hidden sniper

I remember a lot of fresh men landing in high spirits and keen to get up
to the fighting zone They marched along in fours and whistled and sang
but the Turks in the hills soon spotted them and landed a shell in the
middle of them Silence is the scouts shield in wartime

It fell to my lot to make crosses to mark the graves of the dead These
crosses were made out of bullybeef packingcases and on most of them I
was asked to inscribe the name number and regiment of the slain I
did this in purple copying pencil as I had nothing more lasting and
generally it read

 In Memory of 19673
 Pte
 Royal Irish Fus
 RIP

I had to be tombstone maker and engraverand sometimes even sextona
scout turns his hand to anything

We had our advanced dressing station on the left of Chocolate Hillthe
proper name of which is Bakka Baba

Our ambulance wagons had to cross the Salt Lake and often the wheels
sank and we had to take another team of mules to pull them out

The Turks had a towera gleaming white minaretjust beyond Chocolate
Hill near the Moslem cemetery in the village of Anafarta It was
supposed to be a sacred tower but as they used it as an observation
post our battleships in the bay blew it down

Flies swarmed everywhere and were a great cause of disease as after
visiting the dead and the latrines they used to come and have a meal on
our jam and biscuits

During the whole of August and September we were under heavy shellfire
but we got quite used to it and hardly turned to look at a bursting
shell

I must say khaki drill uniform is not a good hiding colour In the
sunlight it showed up too light I believe a particoloured uniform say
of green khaki and gray would be much better Therefore the Scout
who wears a khaki hat green shirt khaki shorts and gray stockings is
really wearing the best uniform for colourprotection in stalking

The more scouting we can introduce the better

Carry on Boy Scouts Bad scoutcraft was one of the chief drawbacks in
what has been dubbed The Glorious Failure




CHAPTER XXVI THE BUSHFIRES


There are some things you never forget

That little Welshman for instance lying on a ledge of rock above our
Brigade Headquarters with a great gaping shrapnel wound in his abdomen
imploring the Medical Officer in the Gaelic tongue to put him out and
how he died with a morphia tablet in his mouth singing at the top of
his highpitched voice

 When the midnight chuchu leaves for Alabam
 Ill be right there
 Ive got my fare
 All aboard
 All aboard
 All aboard for AllaBam
  Midnight chuchu chuchu

And so slowly his soul steamed out of the wrecked station of his body
and left for Alabam

One evening the 25th of August bushfires broke out on the right of
Chocolate Hill

The shells from the Turks set light to the dried sage and thistle and
thorn and soon the whole place was blazing It was a fearful sight
Many wounded tried to crawl away dragging their broken arms and legs
out of the burning bushes and were cremated alive

It was impossible to rescue them Boxes of ammunition caught fire and
exploded with terrific noise in thick bunches of murky smoke A bombing
section tried to throw off their equipment before the explosives burst
but many were blown to pieces by their own bombs Puffs of white smoke
rose up in little clouds and floated slowly across the Salt Lake

The flames ran along the ridges in long lapping lines with a canopy of
blue and gray smoke We could hear the crackle of the burning thickets
and the sharp bang of bullets The sand round Suvla Bay hid thousands
of bullets and ammunition pouches some flung away by wounded men some
belonging to the dead As the bushfires licked from the lower slopes of
the Sari Bair towards Chocolate Hill this lost ammunition exploded and
it sounded like erratic riflefire The fires glowed and spluttered all
night and went on smoking in the morning I had to go up to Chocolate
Hill about some sandbags for our hospital dugouts next day and on the
way up I noticed a human pelvis and a chunk of charred human vertebrae
under a scorched and charcoaled thornbush

Hawk and I kept a very good lookout every day We noted the arrival of
reinforcements and the putting up of new telegraph lines we spotted
incoming transports and the departure of our battleships in the bay

In fact between us we worked a very complete Intelligence
Department of our own We made a rough chart showing the main lines of
communications and the position of snipers and wells telegraph wires
to the artillery and the main observation posts and listening saps

Its just as well said I to know as much as we can how things are
going and to keep account of detailsits safer and might be very
useful

Very true said Hawk ave you noticed ow that little cruiser
comes in every morning at the same time and goes out again in the late
afternoon Also two brigades of Territorials came in last night and
went round by the beach early this morning towards Lala Baba I see the
footprints when I went down for a wash

The colonel had camped us on the edge of the Salt Lake on this side of
an incline which led up to a flat plateau Into this incline we had made
our dugouts and he was now planning the digging out of a squareshaped
place which would hold all our stretchers on which the sick and wounded
lay and would be protected from the Turkish shellfire by being dug
into the solid sandstone

I was looking about for sandtracks and shells and I noticed that the
grass had grown much more luxuriously at one level than it did lower
down This grass was last years and was now yellow and dead and
rustling like paper flowers

This said I to Hawk was last years watermark in the rainy
season

Thats gospel said Hawk and what would you make out o that
observation

He smiled his queer whimsical smile

Why I guess we shall be swamped out of this camp in a months time

Yes practically the ole of this up to this level will be under
water

Then whats the good of starting to dig a big permanent hospital here
when

Yours not to reason why said Hawk its a way they have in the army
but Im not bothering

Each section dug in shifts day after day until the men were worn out
with digging

Then the long flat rainclouds appeared one morning over the distant
range of mountains

You see them said Hawk lighting a woodbine and pointing across
the Salt Lake thats the first sign of the wet season coming up

Sure enough in a few days the colonel had orders to shift his ambulance
to C Beach near Lala Baba as our present position was unfavourable
for the construction of a permanent field hospital owing to the rise of
water in the wet season

Soon after this Hawk was moved to the advanced dressing station on
Chocolate Hill and I had to remain with my section near the Salt Lake
Thus we were separated

Its to break up our click too thick together we bin noticing too
much we know the workin o things too well must break up the combine
dangerous to ave people about oo spot things and keep their jaws
tight Git rid o Hawksee th ideeah Very clever aint it
Practically were the only two oo do feel which way the wind blows an
thats inconvenient sometimes

I asked Hawk while he was on Chocolate Hill to note down in his head
the various snipers posts and the general positions of the British and
Turkish trenches

There came a time when I wanted to send him a note But it was a
dangerous thing to send notes about They might fall into the hands of
some sniper and give away information

Therefore I got a bar of yellow soap from our stores cut it in two
bored out a small hole in one half wrapped up my note put it inside
the soap clapped the two halves together stuck them together by
wetting it and completely concealed the cut by rubbing it with water

I then asked one of the ASC drivers who was going up with the
ambulance wagon in the morning to give the piece of soap to Hawk

He _hasnt_ got any soap I explained and he asked me to send him
a bit Tell him its from me and that I hope hell find it all
rightits the best we have

Hawk got the soap guessed there was a reason for sending it broke it
open and found the note So a simple boyscout trick came in useful on
active service




CHAPTER XXVII THE DEPARTURE


Now came a period of utter stagnation

It was a deadlock

We held the bay the plain of Anafarta the Salt Lake the Kislar Dagh
and Kapanja Sirt in a horseshoe

The Turks held the heights of Sari Bair Anafarta village and the
hills beyond Jeffersons Post in a semicircle enclosing us Nothing
happened We shelled and they shelledevery day Snipers sniped and men
got killed but there was no further advance Things had remained at a
standstill since the first week of the landing

Rumours floated from one unit to another

We were going to make a great attack on the 28thalways a fixed
date the Italians were landing troops to help the Australians at
Anzacevery possible absurdity was noised abroad

Hawk was on Chocolate Hill with our advanced dressing station I was on
C Beach Lala Baba with the remainder of the ambulance I had lost
all my officers by sickness and wounds and I was now the last of the
original NCOs of A Section Except for the swimming and my own
observations of tracks and birds and natural history generally this was
a desperately uninteresting period

Orders to pack up ready for a move came suddenly It was now late in
September The wet season was just beginning The stormclouds were
coming up over the hills in great masses of rolling banks black and
forbidding It grew colder at night and a cold wind sprang up during
the day

Every one was bustling about packing the operating tent and equipment
operating table instruments bottles pans stretchers monkeyboxes
bandages splints cooking dixies bullybeef crates biscuit
tinseverything was being packed up and sorted out ready for moving

But where No one knew We were going to move soon very soon it was
rumoured

Within every mind a small voice askedBlighty And then came another
whiff of rumour The Xth Division are goingEngland perhaps

But it was too good to believe Every one wanted to believe it each
man in his inmost soul hoped it might be true but it couldnt be
England and yet it might

One night the Indian Packmule Corps came trailing down with their
little twowheeled twomuled carts and transported all our medical
panniers away into the gloom and they went towards Lala Baba It was a
good sign

Everything was gone now except our own packs and kit and we had orders
to stand by for the command to Fall in

We lay about in the sand waitingand wondering At last towards the
last minutes of midnight we got the orders to Fall in The NCOs
called the Roll numbered off their sections and reported All
present and correct sir

In a long straggling column we marched from our last encampment towards
Lala Baba The night was very dark and the sand gave under our feet
It was hard going but every man had a gleam of hope and trudged
along heavyladen with rolled overcoat haversack and waterbottle and
stretcher but with a light heart

The advanced party from Chocolate Hill met us at Lala Baba Here
everything was bustle and hurry

Every unit of the Xth Division was packed up and ready for embarkation
Lighters and tugs puffed and grated by the shore Horses stamped and
snorted sergeants swore continually officers nagged and shouted

Men got mixed up and lost their units sections lost their way in the
great crowd of companies assembled

Once Hawk loomed out of the darkness and a strong whiff of rum came
with him he disappeared again See you later Sarntlookin after
thingsimportantpractically everythink

He was full of drink and in his hurry to look after things mostly
bottles he lost some of his own kit and my fieldglasses He worked
hard at getting the equipment into the lighters notwithstanding the
fact that he was threeparts canned

Every now and then he loomed up like some great khakiclad gorilla only
to fade away again to the secret hidingplace of a bottle

And so at last we got aboard It was still a profound secret No one
knew whither we were going or why we were leaving the desolation of
Suvla Bay

But every one was glad Anything would be better than this barren waste
of sand and flies and dead men

That was the last we saw of the bay A sheet of gray water a moving
mob on the slope of Lala Baba the trailing smoke of the tug and a
pitchblack skyand Hawk lurching round and swearing at the loss of his
bottle and his kit

An old seasong was running in my mind

 But two men of her crew alive
 What put to sea with seventyfive

Only three months ago we had landed 25000 strong and now we numbered
about 6000 A fearful lossa smashed Division

We transferred to a troopship standing out in the bay with all possible
speed

Still with the gloom hanging over everything we steamed out and every
man was dead tired

However I found Hawk and we decided not to sleep down below with the
others all crowded together and stinking in the dirty interior of the
ship

We took our hammocks up on deck and slung them forward from the handrail
near one of the great anchors

I had a purpose in doing this I had no intention of going to sleep By
taking note of a certain star which had appeared just to the right of
a crossspar and by noticing its change of position I was enabled to
guess with some exactitude the course we were laying

For the first two or three hours the star and the mast kept a perfectly
unchangeable position

I woke up after dozing for some minutes and taking up my old stand near
the companionway again took my star observation But this time the star
had swept right round and was the other side of the mast We had
changed our course from southwest to north Just then Hawk came up the
companionway no doubt from a bottlehunt down below

ItsSalonika said he

Weve turned almost due north in the last quarter of an hour

I know itbeen down to the stokers bunksits Salonikaanother new
landing

They keep the Xth for making new landings

And so to the GraecoSerbian frontier and a fresh series of adventures
including sickness life in an Egyptian hospitaland then England




CHAPTER XXVIII LOOKING BACK


The queer thing is that when I look back upon that Great Failure it
is not the danger or the importance of the undertaking which is strongly
impressed so much as a jumble of smells and sounds and small things

It is just these small things which no author can make up in his study
at home

The glitter of some one carrying an army biscuittin along the mule
track the imprinted tracks of sandbirds by the blue Aegean shore the
stink of the dead a dead mans hand sticking up through the sand the
blankets soaked each morning by the heavy dew the incessant rattle of a
machinegun behind Peartree Gully the distant ridges of the Sari Bahir
range shimmering in the heat of noonday the angry buzz of the green
and black flies disturbed from a jampot lid the grit of sand in the
mouth with every bite of food the sullen dullness of the overworked
deathwearied troops the hoarse driedup and everlasting question
Any water the silence of the Hindus of the Packmule Corps the
SsseeeeoooopCrashof the high explosives bursting in a
bunch of densely solid smoke on the Kislar Dargh and the slow unfolding
of these masses of smoke and sand in black and khaki rolls the snort
and stampede of a couple of mules bolting along the beach with their
trappings swinging and rattling under their panting bellies the steady
burning of the starlit night skies the regular morning shelling from
the Turkish batteries on the break of dawn over the gloomshrouded
hills the faraway call of some wounded man for Stretchers
Stretchers the naked white men splashing and swimming in the bay the
swoop of a couple of skinny vultures over the burning white sand of
the Salt Lake bed to the stinking and decomposing body of a
shrapnelslaughtered mule hidden in the willowthickets at the bottom
of Chocolate Hill a torn and bulletpierced French warplane stranded on
the other side of Lala Babalying over at an angle like a wounded white
seabird the rush for the little figure bringing in the mails in
a sack over his shoulder the smell of iodine and iodoform round the
hospitaltents the long wobbling moan of the Turkish longdistance
shells and the harmless Zzzeeeeeoooop of their dud shells
which buried themselves so often in the sand without exploding the
tattered begrimed and sunkeneyed appearance of men who had been in the
trenches for three weeks at a stretch the bristling unshaven chins
and the craving desire for woodbines the ingrained stale blood on
my hands and arms from those fearful gaping wounds and the redbrown
bloodstain patches on my khaki drill clothes the pestering curse of
those damnable Suvla Bay flies and the lice with which every officer and
man swarmed

The awfulcutoff Robinson Crusoe feelingno letters from home
no newspapers no books sand biscuits and flies flies bully and
sand

Stayathome critics and prophets of war cannot strike just that tiny
spark of reality which makes the whole thing live

However many diagrams and wonderful ideas these remarkable amateur
experts publish they wont go down with the man who has humped his
pack and has been out

Mention the word Blighty or Ticklers plumandapple Kangaroo
Beach or Jhillo Johnnie or Up yer goan the best o luck to
any man of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and in each case
you will have touched upon a vividly imprinted impresssion of the
Dardanelles

There was adventure wild and queer enough in the Dardanelles campaign to
fill a volume of Turkish Nights Entertainments but the people at home
know nothing of it

This is the very type of adventure and incident which would have aroused
a warsickened people which would have rekindled warweary enthusiasm
and patriotism in the land Maybe most of these accounts of marvellous
escapes and cute encounters secret scoutings and extraordinary
expeditions will lie now for ever with the silent dead and the thousands
of rounds of ammunition in the silver sand of Suvla Bay

The stars still burn above the Salt Lake bed the white breakers roll in
each morning along the blue seashore sometimes washing up the bodies
of the slainjust as they did when we camped near Lala Baba

But the guns are gone and there the heavy silence of the waste places
reigns supreme
