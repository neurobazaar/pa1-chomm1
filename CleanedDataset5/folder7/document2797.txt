Let me go on with the paper reads How brilliant this writing is
Times Chronicle Daily News theyre all good blest if they aint How
much better the nine leaders in them three daily papers is than nine
speeches in the House of Commons Take a very best speech in the Ouse
now and compare it with an article in The Times I say the newspaper
has the best of it for philosophy for wit novelty good sense too And
the party that writes the leading article is nobody and the chap that
speaks in the House of Commons is a hero Lord Lord how the world
is umbugged Poplar representation what IS poplar representation
Dammy its a farce Hallo this article is stole I remember a passage
in Montesquieu uncommonly like it Goes and gets the book As he is
standing upon sofa to get it and sitting down to read it MISS PRIOR
and the Children have come in at the garden Children pass across stage
MISS PRIOR enters by open window bringing flowers into the room

JOHNIt IS like it He slaps the book and seeing MISS PRIOR who
enters then jumps up from sofa saying very respectfully

JOHNI beg your pardon Miss

MISS Psarcastically Do I disturb you Howell

JOHNDisturb I have no right to saya servant has no right to be
disturbed but I hope I may be pardoned for venturing to look at
a volume in the libery Miss just in reference to a newspaper
harticlethats all Miss

MISS PYou are very fortunate in finding anything to interest you in
the paper Im sure

JOHNPerhaps Miss you are not accustomed to political discussion
and ignorant ofahI beg your pardon a servant I know has no right
to speak Exit into diningroom making a low bow

MISS PRIORThe coolness of some people is really quite extraordinary
the airs they give themselves the way in which they answer one the
books they read Montesquieu Esprit des Lois takes book up which
J has left on sofa I believe the man has actually taken this from the
shelf I am sure Mr Milliken or her ladyship never would The other
day Helvetius was found in Mr Howells pantry forsooth It is
wonderful how he picked up French whilst we were abroad Esprit des
Lois what is it it must be dreadfully stupid And as for reading
Helvetius who I suppose was a Roman general I really cant
understand howDear dear what airs these persons give themselves
What will come next A footmanI beg Mr Howells pardona butler
and confidential valet lolls on the drawingroom sofa and reads
Montesquieu Impudence And add to this he follows me for the last two
or three months with eyes that are quite horrid What can the creature
mean But I forgotI am only a governess A governess is not a ladya
governess is but a servanta governess is to work and walk all day with
the children dine in the schoolroom and come to the drawingroom to
play the man of the house to sleep A governess is a domestic only her
place is not the servants hall and she is paid not quite so well as
the butler who serves her her glass of wine Odious George Arabella
there are those little wretches quarrelling again Exit Children are
heard calling out and seen quarrelling in garden

JOHN reenteringSee where she moves grace is in all her steps
Eaven in her highnoaheaven in her heye in every gesture dignity

in kisses it Heres the piano she plays on Pretty keys them fingers
outhivories you When she plays on it I stand and listen at the
drawingroom door and my heart throbs in time Fool fool fool why
did you look on her John Howell why did you beat for her busy heart
You were tranquil till you knew her I thought I could have been ahappy
with Mary till then That girls affection soothed me Her conversation
didnt amuse me much her ideers aint exactly elevated but they are
just and proper Her attentions pleased me She ever kep the best cup
of tea for me She crisped my buttered toast or mixed my quiet tumbler
for me as I sat of hevenings and read my newspaper in the kitching She
respected the sanctaty of my pantry When I was astudying there she
never interrupted me She darned my stockings for me she starched and
folded my chokers and she sowed on the habsent buttons of which time
and chance had bereft my linning She has a good heart Mary has I know
shed get up and black the boots for me of the coldest winter mornings
She did when we was in humbler life she did

Enter MARY

MARYLaw John whatever do you mean

JOHNHm you know not little one you never can know Have YOU ever
felt the pangs of imprisoned genius have YOU ever felt what tis to be
a slave

MARYNot in a free country I should hope John Howellno such a
thing A place is a place and I know mine and am content with the
spear of life in which it pleases heaven to place me John and I wish
you were and remembered what we learned from our parson when we went
to school together in dear old Pigeoncot Johnwhen you used to help
little Mary with her lessons John and fought Bob Brown the big
butchers boy because he was rude to me John and he gave you that
black hi

JOHNSay eye Mary not heye gently

MARYEye and I thought you never looked better in all your life
than you did then and we both took service at Squire Millikensme as
dairygirl and you as knifeboy and good masters have they been to
us from our youth hup both old Squire Milliken and Mr Charles as is
master now and poor Mrs as is dead though she had her tantrumsand I
thought we should save up and take the Milliken Armsand now we have
saved upand now now nowoh you are a stone a stone a stone

Theres the hupstairs bell She starts changing her manner as she
hears the bell and exit

JOHN looking after herIts all true Gospeltrue We were children
in the same villagesat on the same form at school And it was for her
sake that Bob Brown the butchers boy whopped me A black eye Im not
handsome But if I were ugly ugly as the Saracens Ead ugly as that
beast Bulkeley I know it would be all the same to Mary SHE has never
forgot the boy she loved that brought birdsnests for her and
spent his halfpenny on cherries and bought a fairing with his first
halfcrowna brooch it was I remember of two billing doves ahopping
on one twig and brought it home for little yellowhaired blueeyed
redcheeked Mary Lord Lord I dont like to think how Ive kissed em
the pretty cheeks theyve got quite pale now with cryingand she has
never once reproached me not once the trump the little trrump

Is it my fault stamping that Fate has separated us Why did my young
master take me up to Oxford and give me the run of his libery and the
society of the best scouts in the University Why did he take me abroad
Why have I been to Italy France Jummany with himtheir manners noted
and their realms surveyed by jingo Ive improved myself and Mary has
remained as you was I try a conversation and she cant respond Shes
never got a word of poetry beyond Watts Ims and if I talk of Byron or
Moore to her Im blest if she knows anything more about em than the
cook who is as hignorant as a pig or that beast Bulkeley Lady Kicks
footman Above all why why did I see the woman upon whom my
wretched heart is fixed for ever and who carries away my soul with
herprostrate I say prostrate through the mud at the skirts of her
gownd Enslaver why did I ever come near you O enchantress Kelipso
how you have got hold of me It was Fate Fate Fate When Mrs Milliken
fell ill of scarlet fever at Naples Milliken was away at Petersborough
Rooshia looking after his property Her foring woman fled Me and the
governess remained and nursed her and the children We nursed the little
ones out of the fever We buried their mother We brought the children
home over Halp and Happenine I nursed em all three I tended em all
three the orphans and the lovely gugugoverness At Rome where she
took ill I waited on her as we went to Florence had we been attacked
by twenty thousand brigands this little arm had courage for them all
And if I loved thee Julia was I wrong and if I basked in thy beauty
day and night Julia am I not a man and if before this Peri this
enchantress this gazelle I forgot poor little Mary Barlow how could I
help it I say how the doose could I help it

Horace Milliken Why in your wifes time it was better than this my
poor fellow

MILLIKENDont speak of her in THAT way George Touchit

TOUCHITWhat have I said I am only regretting her loss for our sake
She tyrannized over you turned your friends out of doors took your
name out of your clubs dragged you about from party to party though
you can no more dance than a bear and from opera to opera though you
dont know God Save the Queen from Rule Britannia You dont sir
you know you dont But Arabella was better than her mother who has
taken possession of you since your widowhood

MILLIKENMy dear fellow no she hasnt Theres MY mother

TOUCHITYes to be sure theres Mrs Bonnington and they quarrel
over you like the two ladies over the baby before King Solomon

MILLIKENPlay the satirist my good friend laugh at my weakness

TOUCHITI know you to be as plucky a fellow as ever stepped Milliken
when a mans in the case I know you and I stood up to each other for an
hour and a half at Westminster

MILLIKENThank you We were both dragons of war tremendous champions
Perhaps I am a little soft as regards women I know my weakness well
enough but in my case what is my remedy Put yourself in my position
Be a widower with two young children What is more natural than that
the mother of my poor wife should come and superintend my family My own
mother cant She has a halfdozen of little half brothers and sisters
and a husband of her own to attend to I dare say Mr Bonnington and my
mother will come to dinner today

TOUCHITOf course they will my poor old Milliken you dont dare to
dine without them

MILLIKENDont go on in that manner George Touchit Why should not my
stepfather and my mother dine with me I can afford it I am a domestic
man and like to see my relations about me I am in the city all day

TOUCHITLuckily for you

MILLIKENAnd my pleasure of an evening is to sit under my own vine and
under my own figtree with my own olivebranches round about me to sit
by my fire with my children at my knees to coze over a snug bottle of
claret after dinner with a friend like you to share it to see the young
folks at the breakfasttable of a morning and to kiss them and so off
to business with a cheerful heart This was my scheme in marrying had
it pleased heaven to prosper my plan When I was a boy and came from
school and college I used to see Mr Bonnington my fatherinlaw with
HIS young ones clustering round about him so happy to be with him so
eager to wait on him all down on their little knees round my mother
before breakfast or jumping up on his after dinner It was who should
reach his hat and who should bring his coat and who should fetch his
umbrella and who should get the last kiss

TOUCHITWhat didnt he kiss YOU Oh the hardhearted old ogre

MILLIKENDONT Touchit Dont laugh at Mr Bonnington he is as good
a fellow as ever breathed Between you and me as my half brothers and
sisters increased and multiplied year after year I used to feel rather
lonely rather bowled out you understand But I saw them so happy that
I longed to have a home of my own When my mother proposed Arabella for
me for she and Lady Kicklebury were immense friends at one time I was
glad enough to give up clubs and bachelorhood and to settle down as a
married man My mother acted for the best My poor wifes character
my mother used to say changed after marriage I was not as happy as I
hoped to be but I tried for it George I am not so comfortable now as
I might be A house without a mistress with two mothersinlaw reigning
over itone worldly and aristocratic another what you call serious
though she dont mind a rubber of whist I give you my honor my mother
plays a game at whist and an uncommonly good game tooeach woman
dragging over a child to her side of course such a family cannot be
comfortable Bell rings Theres the first dinnerbell Go and dress
for heavens sake

TOUCHITWhy dress There is no company

MILLIKENWhy ah her ladyship likes it you see And it costs nothing
to humor her Quick for she dont like to be kept waiting

TOUCHITHorace Milliken what a pity it is the law declares a widower
shall not marry his wifes mother She would marry you elseshe would
on my word

MRS POh those dear dear sermons Do you know madam that my
little Adolphus for whom your sons bounty procured his place at
Christs Hospital was very much touched indeed the dear child with

which he keeps in his great dictionary and fought with my child
Frederick who is three years older than Georgeactually beat his own
uncle

MRS PGracious mercy Master Frederick was not hurt I hope

she commands everything and everybody in it She has driven memeMr
Millikens own motheralmost out of it She has so annoyed my dear
husband that Mr Bonnington will scarcely come here Is she not always
sneering at private tutors because Mr Bonnington was my sons private
tutor and greatly valued by the late Mr Milliken Is she not making
constant allusions to old women marrying young men because Mr
Bonnington happens to be younger than me I have no words to express my
indignation respecting Lady Kicklebury She never pays any one and
runs up debts in the whole town Her man Bulkeleys conduct in the
neighborhood is quitequite

Park I could not walk through the Park in my cap Isnt it a pretty
ribbon Mrs Prior

MRS PBeautiful beautiful How blue becomes you Who would think you

Mrs P hand in hand As Captain TOUCHIT enters dressed for dinner he

TOUCHITSo we are to wear our white cravats and our varnished boots
and dine in ceremony What is the use of a man being a widower if he
cant dine in his shootingjacket Poor Mill He has the slavery now
without the wife He speaks sarcastically to the picture Well well
Mrs Milliken YOU at any rate are gone and with the utmost respect
for you I like your picture even better than the original Miss Prior

Enter Miss PRIOR

MISS PRIORI beg pardon I thought you were gone to dinner I heard
the second bell some time since She is drawing back

TOUCHITStop I say Julia She returns he looks at her takes her
hand Why do you dress yourself in this odd poky way You used to be
a very smartly dressed girl Why do you hide your hair and wear such a
dowdy high gown Julia

JULIAYou mustnt call me Julia Captain Touchit

TOUCHITWhy when I lived in your mothers lodging I called you
Julia When you brought up the tea you didnt mind being called Julia
When we used to go to the play with the tickets the Editor gave us who
lived on the second floor

JULIAThe wretchdont speak of him

TOUCHITAh I am afraid he was a sad deceiver that Editor He was
a very clever fellow What droll songs he used to sing What a heap of
playtickets dioramatickets concerttickets he used to give you Did
he touch your heart Julia

JULIAFiddlededee No man ever touched my heart Captain Touchit

TOUCHITWhat not even Tom Flight who had the second floor after the
Editor left itand who cried so bitterly at the idea of going out to
India without you You had a tendre for hima little passionyou know
you had Why even the ladies here know it Mrs Bonnington told me that
you were waiting for a sweetheart in India to whom you were engaged and
Lady Kicklebury thinks you are dying in love for the absent swain

JULIAI hopeI hopeyou did not contradict them Captain Touchit

TOUCHITWhy not my dear

JULIAMay I be frank with you You were a kind very kind friend to
usto me in my youth

TOUCHITI paid my lodgings regularly and my bills without asking
questions I never weighed the tea in the caddy or counted the lumps of
sugar or heeded the rapid consumption of my liqueur

JULIAHush hush I know they were taken I know you were very good to
us You helped my poor papa out of many a difficulty

TOUCHIT asideTipsy old coalmerchant I did and he helped himself
too

JULIAAnd you were always our best friend Captain Touchit When our
misfortunes came you got me this situation with Mrs Millikenand
anddont you see

TOUCHITWellwhat

JULIA laughingI think it is best under the circumstances that the
ladies here should suppose I am engaged to be marriedor or they might
bemight be jealous you understand Women are sometimes jealous of
othersespecially mothers and mothersinlaw

TOUCHITOh you arch schemer And it is for that you cover up that
beautiful hair of yours and wear that demure cap

JULIA slylyI am subject to rheumatism in the head Captain Touchit

TOUCHITIt is for that you put on the spectacles and make yourself
look a hundred years old

JULIAMy eyes are weak Captain Touchit

TOUCHITWeak with weeping for Tom Flight You hypocrite Show me your
eyes

MISS PNonsense

TOUCHITShow me your eyes I say or Ill tell about Tom Flight and
that he has been married at Madras these two years

MISS POh you horrid man takes glasses off There

TOUCHITTranslucent orbs beams of flashing light lovely lashes
veiling celestial brightness No they havent cried much for Tom
Flight that faithless captain nor for Lawrence OReilly that killing
Editor It is lucky you keep the glasses on them or they would transfix
Horace Milliken my friend the widower here DO you always wear them
when you are alone with him

MISS PI never AM alone with him Bless me If Lady Kicklebury thought
my eyes werewell wellyou know what I meanif she thought her
soninlaw looked at me I should be turned out of doors the next day
I am sure I should And then poor Mr Milliken he never looks at
MEheaven help him Why he cant see me for her ladyships nose and
awful caps and ribbons He sits and looks at the portrait yonder and
sighs so He thinks that he is lost in grief for his wife at this very
moment

TOUCHITWhat a woman that waseh Juliathat departed angel What a
temper she had before her departure

MISS PBut the wind was tempered to the lamb If she was angrythe
lamb was so very lamblike and meek and fleecy

TOUCHITAnd what a desperate flirt the departed angel was I knew
half a dozen fellows before her marriage whom she threw over because
Milliken was so rich

MISS PShe was consistent at least and did not change after marriage
as some ladies do but flirted as you call it just as much as before
At Paris young Mr Verney the attache was never out of the house
at Rome Mr Beard the artist was always drawing pictures of her
at Naples when poor Mr M went away to look after his affairs at St
Petersburg little Count Posilippo was for ever coming to learn English
and practise duets She scarcely ever saw the poor childrenchanging
her manner as Lady KICKLEBURY enters Hushmy lady

TOUCHITYou may well say poor children deprived of such a woman
Miss Prior whom I knew in very early daysas your ladyship knowswas
speakingwas speaking of the loss our poor friend sustained

LADY KAh sir what a loss looking at the picture

TOUCHITWhat a woman she waswhat a superior creature

LADY KA creaturean angel

TOUCHITMercy upon us how she and my lady used to quarrel aside
What a temper

LADY KHmoh yeswhat a temper rather doubtfully at first

TOUCHITWhat a loss to Milliken and the darling children

MISS PRIORLuckily they have YOU with them madam

LADY KAnd I will stay with them Miss Prior I will stay with them I
will never part from Horace I am determined

MISS PAh I am very glad you stay for if I had not YOU for a
protector I think you know I must go Lady Kicklebury I think you
know there are those who would forget my attachment to these darling
children my services toto herand dismiss the poor governess But
while you stay I can stay dear Lady Kicklebury With you to defend me
from jealousy I need not QUITE be afraid

LADY KOf Mrs Bonnington Of Mr Millikens mother of the parsons
wife who writes out his stupid sermons and has half a dozen children of
her own I should think NOT indeed I am the natural protector of these
children I am their mother I have no husband You STAY in this house
Miss Prior You are a faithful attached creaturethough you were sent
in by somebody I dont like very much pointing to TOUCHIT who went off
laughing when JULIA began her speech and is now looking at prints c
in next room

MISS PCaptain Touchit may not be in all things what one could wish
But his kindness has formed the happiness of my life in making me
acquainted with YOU maam and I am sure you would not have me be
ungrateful to him

LADY KA most highly principled young woman Goes out in garden and
walks up and down with Captain TOUCHIT

Enter Mrs BONNINGTON

MISS POh how glad I am you are come Mrs Bonnington Have you
brought me that pretty hymn you promised me You always keep your
promises even to poor governesses I read dear Mr Bonningtons sermon
It was so interesting that I really could not think of going to sleep
until I had read it all through it was delightful but oh its still
better when he preaches it I hope I did not do wrong in copying a part
of it I wish to impress it on the children There are some worldly
influences at work with them dear madam looking at Lady K in the
garden which I do my feeble effort toto modify I wish YOU could
come oftener

MRS BI will try my dearI will try Emily has sweet dispositions

MISS PAh she takes after her grandmamma Bonnington

MRS BBut George was sadly fractious just now in the schoolroom
because I tried him with a tract

MISS PLet us hope for better times Do be with your children dear
Mrs Bonnington as constantly as ever you can for MY sake as well as
theirs I want protection and advice as well as they do The GOVERNESS
dear lady looks up to you as well as the pupils SHE wants the teaching
which you and dear Mr Bonnington can give her Ah why could not Mr
and Mrs Bonnington come and live here I often think The children
would have companions in their dear young uncles and aunts so pleasant
it would be The house is quite large enough that is if her ladyship
did not occupy the three south rooms in the left wing Ah why WHY
couldnt you come

MRS BYou are a kind affectionate creature Miss Prior I do not
very much like the gentleman who recommended you to Arabella you know
But I do think he sent my son a good governess for his children

Two Ladies walk up and down in front garden

TOUCHIT enters

and surprise

moment and had your Opera box every night She drinks champagne while
talking and excites herself

MISS PDont take that mamma

MRS PDont take it why it costs nothing Milliken can afford it
Do you suppose I get champagne every day I might have had it as a girl

MILLIKENWellII cant sayIlike himin fact I dont But
thats no reason why his mother shouldnt During this HOWELL
preceded by BULKELEY hands round coffee The garden without has
darkened as if evening BULKELEY is going away without offering coffee
to Miss PRIOR JOHN stamps on his foot and points to her Captain
TOUCHIT laughing goes up and talks to her now the servants are gone

MRS BHorace I must tell you that the waste at your table is
shocking What is the need of opening all this wine You and Lady
Kicklebury were the only persons who took champagne

TOUCHITI never drink itnever touch the rubbish Too old a stager

LADY KPort I think is your favorite Mrs Bonnington

MRS BMy dear lady I do not mean that you should not have champagne
if you like Pray pray dont be angry But why on earth for you
who take so little and Horace who only drinks it to keep you company
should not Howell open a pint instead of a great large bottle

LADY KOh Howell Howell We must not mention Howell my dear Mrs
Bonnington Howell is faultless Howell has the keys of everything
Howell is not to be controlled in anything Howell is to be at liberty
to be rude to my servant

MILLIKENIs that all I am sure I should have thought your man was big
enough to resent any rudeness from poor little Howell

LADY KHorace Excuse me for saying that you dont knowthethe
class of servant to whom Bulkeley belongs I had him as a great favor
from Lord Toddleby That class of servant is accustomed generally not to
go out single

MILLIKENUnless they are two behind a carriageperch they pine away
as one lovebird does without his mate

LADY KNo doubt no doubt I only say you are not accustomed herein
this kind of establishment you understandto that class of

MRS BLady Kicklebury is my sons establishment not good enough for
any powdered monster in England Is the house of a British merchant

LADY KMy dear creature my dear creature it IS the house of a
British merchant and a very comfortable house

MRS BYes as you find it

LADY KYes as I find it when I come to take care of my departed
angels children Mrs Bonningtonpointing to pictureof THAT
dear seraphs orphans Mrs Bonnington YOU cannot You have other
dutiesother childrena husband at home in delicate health who

MRS BLady Kicklebury no one shall say I dont take care of my dear
husband

MILLIKENMy dear mother My dear Lady Kicklebury To T who has come
forward They spar so every night they meet Touchit Aint it hard

LADY KI say you DO take care of Mr Bonnington Mrs Bonnington my
dear creature and that is why you cant attend to Horace And as he
is of a very easy temperexcept sometimes with his poor Arabellas
motherhe allows all his tradesmen to cheat him all his servants to
cheat him Howell to be rude to everybodyto me amongst other people
and why not to my servant Bulkeley with whom Lord Toddlebys groom of
the chambers gave me the very highest character

MRS BIm surprised that noblemen HAVE grooms in their chambers I
should think they were much better in the stables I am sure I always
think so when we dine with Doctor Clinker His man does bring such a
smell of the stable with him

LADY KHe he you mistake my dearest creature Your poor mother
mistakes my good Horace You have lived in a quiet and most respectable
spherebut notnot

MRS BNot what Lady Kicklebury We have lived at Richmond twenty
yearsin my late husbands timewhen we saw a great deal of company
and when this dear Horace was a dear boy at Westminster School And we
have PAID for everything we have had for twenty years and we have owed
not a penny to any TRADESMAN though we maynt have had POWDERED
FOOTMEN SIX FEET HIGH who were impertinent to all the maids in the
placeDont I WILL speak Horacebut servants who loved us and who
lived in our families

MILLIKENMamma now my dear good old mother I am sure Lady
Kicklebury meant no harm

LADY KMe my dear Horace harm What harm could I mean

fourth They go on so every night almost Aint it a pity now

quarrelling with old dragons about the odd trick I will go and smoke
a cigar on the terrace and contemplate the silver Thames the darkling
woods the starry hosts of heaven II like smoking better than playing
