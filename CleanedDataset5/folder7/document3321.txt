CHILDREN OF THE WHIRLWIND

By Leroy Scott




CHAPTER I


It was an uninspiring bit of street narrow paved with cobble hot and
noisy in summer reeking with unwholesome mud during the drizzling and
snowslimed months of winter It looked anything this May after noon
except a startingplace for drama But then the great dramas of life
often avoid the splendid estates and trappings with which conventional
romance would equip them and have their beginnings in unlikeliest
environment and thence sweep on to a noble consuming tragedy or to
a glorious unfolding of souls Life is a composite of contradictionsa
puzzle to the wisest of us the lily lifting its graceful purity aloft
may have its roots in a dunghill Samsons dead lion putrefying by a
roadside is ever and again being found to be a storehouse of wild honey
We are too accustomed to the ordinary and the obvious to consider that
beauty or worth may after bitter travail grow out of that which is
ugly and unpromising

Thus no one who looked on Maggie Carlisle and Larry Brainard at their
beginnings had even a guess what manner of persons were to develop from
them or what their stories were to be

The houses on the bit of street were all threestoried and all of a
uniform dingy scaling redness The house of the Duchess on the left
side as you came down the street toward the little Square which squatted
beside the East River differed from the others only in that three balls
of tarnished gilt swung before it and unredeemed pledges emanated a
weakly lure from behind its dirtstreaked windows and also in that the
personality of the Duchess gave the house something of a character of
its own

The street did business with her when pressed for funds but it knew
little definite about the Duchess except that she was shriveled and bent
and almost wordless and was seemingly without emotions But of course
there were rumors She was so old and had been so long in the drab
little street that she was as much a legend as a real person No one
knew exactly how she had come by the name of Duchess There were
misty unsupported stories that long long ago she had been a shapely
and royal figure in colored fleshings and that her title had been given
her in those her ruling days Also there was a vague story that she had
come by the name through an old liking for the romances of that writer
who put forth her or his or their prolific extravagances under the
exalted pseudonym of The Duchess Also there was a rumor that the
title came from a former alleged habit of the Duchess of carrying
beneath her shapeless dress a hoard of jewels worthy to be a duchys
heirlooms But all these were just storiesno more Down in this
quarter of New York nicknames come easily and once applied they adhere
to the end

Some believed that she was now the mere ashes of a woman in whom lived
only the last flickering spark And some believed that beneath that drab
and spent appearance there smouldered a great fire which might blaze
forth upon some occasion But no one knew As she was now so she
had always been even in the memory of people considered old in the
neighborhood

Beside the fact that she ran a pawnshop which was reputed to be also a
fence there were only two or three other facts that were known to her
neighbors One was that in the far past there had been a daughter and
that while still a very young girl this daughter had disappeared It was
rumored that the Duchess had placed the daughter in a convent and that
later tire girl had married but the daughter had never appeared again
in the quarter Another fact was that there was a grandson a handsome
young devil who had come down occasionally to visit his grandmother
until he began his involuntary sojourn at Sing Sing Another factthis
one the best known of allwas that two or three years before an
impudent willful young girl named Maggie Carlisle had come to live with
her

It was rather a meager history People wondered and talked of mystery
But perhaps the only mystery arose from the fact that the Duchess was
the kind of woman who never volunteered information about her affairs
and the kind even the boldly curious hesitate to question

And down here it was in this unlovely street in the Duchesss unlovely
house that the drama of Maggie Carlisle and Larry Brainard began
its unpromising and stormy career for though they had thought of it
little their forebears had been sowers of the wind they themselves had
sown some of that careless seed and were to sow yet moreand there was
to be the reaping of that seeds wild crop




CHAPTER II


When Maggie entered the studio on the Duchesss third floor the big
redhaired unkempt painter roared his rebukes at her She stiffened
and in the resentment of her proud youth did not even offer an
explanation Nodding to her father and Barney Palmer she silently
crossed to the window and stood sullenly gazing over the single mongrel
tree before the house and down the narrow street and across the little
Square at the swirling black tide which raced through East River That
painter was a beast Yes and a fool

But quickly the painter was forgotten and once more her mind reverted
to Larryat last Larry was coming backonly to have the painter
after a minute interrupt her excited imagination with

Whats the matter with your tongue Maggie Generally you stab back
with it quick enough

She turned still sulky and silent and gazed with cynical superiority
at the easel Nutsit was Barney Palmer who had thus lightly
rechristened the painter when he had set up his studio in the attic
above the pawnshop six months beforeNuts was transferring the seamy
cunning face of her father Old Jimmie Carlisle to the canvas with
swift unhesitating strokes

For the lova Christ and the twelve apostles including that piker
Judas woefully intoned Old Jimmie from the models chair lemme get
down off this platform

Move and Ill wipe my palette off on that Mardi Gras vest of yours
grunted the big painter autocratically through his mouthful of brushes

O Godand I got a cramp in my back and my necks gone to
sleep groaned Old Jimmie leaning forward on his cane Daughter
dearplaintively to Maggiewhat is the crazy gentleman doing to me

Its an awful smear father Maggie spoke slightingly but with a tone
of doubt It was not the sort of picture that eighteen has been taught
to likeyet the picture did possess an intangible something that
provoked doubt as to its quality You sure do look one old burglar

Not a cheap burglarhopefully

Naw exploded the man at the easel in his big voice first taking the
brushes from his mouth Youre a swelllooking old pirateready to
loot the subtreasury and then scuttle the old craft with all hands on
board A breathing speaking robbing likeness

Maggies right and Nutss right put in Barney Palmer Its sure a
rotten picture and then again it sure looks like you Jimmie

The smartly dressed BarneyBarney could not keep away from Broadway
tailors and haberdashers with their extravagant designs and color
schemesdismissed the insignificant matter of the portrait and resumed
the really important matter which had brought him to her

Are you certain Maggie that the Duchess hasnt heard from Larry

If she has she hasnt mentioned it But why dont you ask her
yourself

I did but she wouldnt say a thing You cant get a word out of the
Duchess with a jimmy unless she wants to talkand she never wants to
talk He turned his sharp narrowly set eyes upon the lean old man
Its got me guessing Jimmie Larry was due out of Sing Sing yesterday
and we havent had a peep from him and though she wont talk Im sure
he hasnt been here to see his grandmother

Sure is funny agreed Old Jimmie But mebbe Larry has broke straight
into a fresh game and is playing a lone hand Hes a quick worker Larry
isand hes got nerve

Well whatevers keeping him were tied up till Larry comes Barney
turned back to Maggie I say sister how about robing yourself in your
raiment of joy and coming with yours truly to a palace of jazz there to
dine and show the populace what real dancing is

Cant Barney Mr Huntthe name given the painter at his original
christeningasked the Duchess and me to have dinner up here Hes to
cook it himself

For your sake I hope he cooks better than he paints And sliding
down in his chair until he rested upon a more comfortable vertebra the
elegant Barney lit a monogrammed cigarette and with idle patience swung
his bamboo stick

Youre half an hour late Maggie Hunt began at her again in his
rumbling voice Cant stand for such a waste of my time

How about my time retorted Maggie who indeed had a grievance I was
supposed to have the day off but instead I had to carry that tray of
cigarettes around till the last person in the Ritzmore had finished
lunch Anyhow she added I dont see that your times worth so much
when you spend it on such painty messes as these

Its not up to you to tell me what my times worth retorted Hunt I
pay youthats enough for you Because you werent on time I stuck
Old Jimmie out there to finish off this picture Ill be through with
the old cutthroat in ten minutes Be ready to take his place

All right said Maggie sulkily

For all his roaring she was not much afraid of the painter While his
brushes flicked at and streaked across the canvas she stood idly
watching him He was in paintsmeared baggy trousers and a soft shirt
whose open collar gave a glimpse of a deep chest matted with hair and
whose rolledup sleeves revealed forearms that seemed absurdly large to
be fiddling with those slender sticks A crowbar would have seemed
more in harmony He was unromantically oldall of thirtyfive Maggie
guessed and with his square roughhewn face and tousled reddish hair
he was decidedly ugly But for the fact that he really did workthough
of course his work was foolishand the fact that he paid his wayhe
bought little but no one could beat him by so much as a penny in a
bargain not even the DuchessMaggie might have considered him as one
of the many bums who floated purposelessly through that drab region

Also had there not been so many queer people coming and going in this
neighborhoodEads Howe the hobo millionaire settlement workers
people who had grown rich and old in their business and preferred to
live near itMaggie might have regarded Hunt with more curiosity and
even with suspicion but down here one accepted queer people as a matter
of course the only fear being that secretly they might be police or
government agents which Maggie and the others knew very well Hunt was
not When Hunt had rented this attic as a studio they had accepted
his explanation that he had taken it because it was cheap and he could
afford to pay no more Likewise they had accepted his explanation that
he was a mechanic by trade who had roughed it all over the world and
was possessed with an itch for painting that lately he had worked in
various garages that it was his habit to hoard his money till he got a
bit ahead and then go off on a painting spree All these admissions
were indubitably plausible for his paintings seemed the unmistakable
handiwork of an irresponsible hardfisted motor mechanic

Maggie shifted to her other foot and glanced casually at the canvases
which leaned against the walls of the shabby studio There was the
Duchess incredibly old the face a web of wrinkles the lips indrawn
over toothless and shrunken gums the nose a thin curved beak the
eyes deepset gleaming inscrutable watching and drawn tight over
the haireven Maggie did not know whether that hair was a wig or the
Duchesssthe faded Oriental shawl which was fastened beneath her chin
and which fell over her thin bent chest There was OFlaherty the
goodnatured policeman on the beat There was the old watchmaker next
door There was Black Hurley the notorious gang leader who sometimes
swaggered into the district like a dirty and evil feudal lord There was
a Jewish pushcart peddler whitebearded and skullcapped There was an
Italian mother sitting on the curb her feet in the gutter smiling down
at the baby that was hungrily suckling at her milkheavy breast And so
on and so on Just the ordinary uninteresting things Maggie saw around
the block There was not a single pretty picture in the lot

Hunt swung the canvas from his easel and stood it against the wall
Thatll be all for you Jimmie Beat it and make room for Maggie
Maggie take your same pose

Old Jimmie ambled forward and gazed at his portrait as Hunt was settling
an unfinished picture on his easel It had rather amused Jimmie and
filled in his idle time to sit for the crazy painter and incidentally
another picture of him would do him no particular harm since the police
already had all the pictures they needed of him over at Headquarters As
he gazed at Hunts work Old Jimmie snickered

I say Nuts what you goin to do with this mess of paint

Going to sell it to the Metropolitan Museum you old sinner snapped
Hunt

Old Jimmie cackled at the joke He knew pictures that is good
pictures He had had an invisible hand in more than one clever
transaction in which handsome pictures alleged to have been smuggled in
Gainsboroughs and Romneys and such there had been most profit for him
in handling the forgeries of these particular masters had been put
with an air of great secrecy into the hands of divers newly rich
gentlemen who believed they were getting masterpieces at bargain prices
through this evasion of customs laws

Nuts chuckled Old Jimmie this junk wouldnt be so funny if you
didnt seem to believe you were really painting

Junk Funny Hunt swung around one big hand closed about Jimmies
lean neck and the other seized his thin shoulder You grandfather of
the devil and all his male progeny you talk like that and Ill chuck
you through the window

Old Jimmie grinned The grip of the big hands of the painter though
powerful was light They all knew that the loud ravings of the painter
never presaged violence They had grown to like him to accept him as
almost one of themselves though of course they looked down upon him
with amused pity for his imbecility regarding his paintings

Get out of here continued Hunt or cut out all this noise that comes
from your having a brain that rattles Ive got to work

Hunt turned again to his easel and Old Jimmie still grinning lowered
himself into a chair lit a cigar and winked at Barney Hunt with
brush poised regarded Maggie a moment

You there Maggie he ordered chin up a bit more some flash in your
eyes more pep in your bearingas though you were asking all the dames
of the Winter Garden and the Charity Ball and the Horse Show and that
gang of teaswilling women at the Ritzmore you sell cigarettes toas
though you were asking them all who the dickens they think they are O
God cant you do anything

Im doing the best I can and I look more like those dames than you
look like a painter

Shut up Im paying you a dollar an hour to pose not to talk back to
me And youd have more respect for my money if you knew how hard I had
to work to earn it carrying a motor car around in each hand Wash off
that scowl and try to look as I said There thats better Hold it

He began to paint rapidly with quick glances back and forth between the
canvas and Maggie Maggies dress was just the ordinary shirtwaist and
skirt that the shopgirl and her sisters wear Hunt had ordered it so
She was above the medium height with thick black hair tinted with
shadowy blue long dark lashes dark scimitars of eyebrows a full firm
mouth a nose with just the right tilt to itall effective points for
Hunt in what he wished to do But what had attracted him most and given
him his idea was her look hardly pertness or impudencerather a
cynical mature defiant certainty in herself

Erect in her cheap shirtwaist she gazed off into space with a smiling
confident challenge to all the world Hunt was trying to make his
picture a true portraitand also make it a symbol of many things which
still were only taking shape in his own mind of beauty rising from the
gutter to overcome beauty of more favored birth and to reign above
it also of a lower stratum surging up and breaking through the upper
stratum becoming a part of it or assimilating it or conquering it
Leading families replaced by other families classes replaced by other
classes nations replaced by other nationssuch was the inevitable
social processso read the records of the fifty or sixty centuries
since history began to be written Oh he was trying to say a lot in
this portrait of a girl of ordinary birtheven less than ordinaryin
her cheap shirtwaist and skirt

And it pleased the sardonic element in Hunts unmoral nature that this
Maggie through whom he was trying to symbolize so much he knew to be a
petty larcenist shoplifting and matters of similar consequence She
had been cynically frank about this to him casual almost boastful Her
possessing a bent toward such activities was hardly to be wondered at
with her having Old Jimmie as her father and the Duchess as a landlady
and having for acquaintances such gentlemen as Barney Palmer and this
returning prisonbird Larry Brainard

But petty crime thought Hunt would not be Maggies forte if she
developed her possibilities With her looks her boldness her
cleverness she had the makings of a magnificent adventuress As he
painted he wondered what she was going to do and become and he
watched her not only with a painters eye intent upon the present but
with keen speculation upon the future




CHAPTER III


Presently Hunts mind shifted to Larry Brainard whom Barney Palmer and
Old Jimmie Carlisle had come here to see Hunt had a mind curious about
every thing and every one and blustering bullying creature though he
was he had the gift possessed by but few of audaciously thrusting
himself into other peoples affairs without arousing their resentment
He was keen to learn Maggies attitude toward Larry and he spoke not so
much to gain knowledge of Larry as to draw her out

This Larrywhat sort of chap is he Maggie As with most artists
talking did not interfere with Hunts painting

Warm color slowly tinted Maggies cheeks Hes clever she said
positively You already know that But I was only a girl when he was
sent away

Hunt smiled at her idea of her present maturity implied by her last
sentence But you lived with the Duchess for a year before he was sent
away You must have seen a lot of him and got to know him well

Oh he used to come down now and then to see his grandmotherI was
only fifteen or sixteen thenjust a girl and he didnt pay much
attention to me Father can tell you better just how smart he is

Old Jimmie spoke up promptly He knew Hunt was not a police stool and
he liked the painter as much as it was in him to like any man so he
felt none of the reserve or caution that might have controlled him in
other company

You bet Larrys smart Got the quickest brain of any con man in the
businessand him only about twentyseven now Some think Im a smooth
proposition myself but Larry puts it all over me Thats why Im
willing to let him be my boss Hes a wonder at thinking up new stunts
and then at working out safe new ways of putting them across

But the police landed him at last commented Hunt

Yes but that was only because another man muffed his end of the job

The handsome Barney Palmer had been restless during Old Jimmies eulogy
Oh Larrys all to the goodbut hes not the only party thats got
real ideas

Huh grunted Old Jimmie But youll remember that we havent put over
any big ones since Larrys been in stir

Thats been because you wouldnt listen to any of my ideas retorted
Barney And I handed out some peaches

Even during the period of Larrys active reign it had irked Barney to
accept another man as leader and it had irked him even more during the
interregnum while Larry was guest of the State For Barney believed in
his own Napoleonic strain

Dont let yourself get sore Barney Old Jimmie said appeasingly
Youll have plenty of chances to try out your ideas as the main guy
before you cash in You know the outfit wanted to lay low for a while
anyhow But well be putting over a lot of the big stuff when Larry gets
out

Hunt had noted a quick light come into Maggies dark eyes while her
father praised the absent leader He himself suddenly perceived a new
possibility

Maggie ever think about teaming up with Larry he demanded with his
audacious keenness

She flushed and hesitated He did not wait for her slowcoming reply
but turned to her father

Jimmie did Larry ever use women in his stunts

Never Whenever we suggested using a skirt Larry absolutely said there
was nothing doing Thats one point where he was all wrong Nothing
helps so much when the sucker is at all sentimental as a clever
goodlooking woman And Larryll come around to it all right Hell
see the sense of it now that hes older and has had two years to think
things over

Old Jimmie nodded showing his yellow teeth in a sly grin You said
something a second ago Maggie and Larry Theyll make a wonder of a
team I mean that shell work under him with the rest of us Ive been
thinking about it a long while Mebbe you havent guessed it but weve
been coaching her for the part and shes just about ripe Shes got
the looks and we can dress her right for whatever jobs on hand Oh
Larryll put over some great things with Maggie

If Hunt felt that there was anything cynically unpaternal in this father
planning for his daughter a career of crime he gave no sign of it His
attention was just then all on Maggie He saw her eyes grow yet more
bright at these last sentences of her father bright with the vision of
approaching adventure

The idea suits you Maggie he asked

Sure Itll be greatfor Larry is a wonder

Barney Palmer suddenly rose his face twisted with anger Im all fed
up on this Larry Larry Larry Come on Jimmie Lets get uptown

Wise Old Jimmie saw that Barney was near an outburst All right
Barney all right he said promptly Not much use waiting any longer
anyhow If Larry comes well fix it with the Duchess to meet him
tomorrow

Then solong Maggie Barney flung at her and that swagger exjockey
gambler and clever manipulator of the confidence of people with money
slashed aside the shabby burlap curtains with his wisp of a bamboo
walkingstick and strode out of the room

Goodnight daughter and Old Jimmie crossed and kissed her She
kissed him backa perfunctory kiss Maggie had never paused to think
the matter out but for some reason she felt little real affection for
her father though of course she admired his astuteness Perhaps her
unconscious lack of love was due in part to the fact that she had never
lived with him Ever since she remembered he had boarded her out here
and there as he was now boarding her at the Duchesssand had only
come to visit her at intervals sometimes intervals that stretched into
months

Barney is rather sweet on you remarked Hunt after the two were gone

I know he is conceded Maggie in a matteroffact way

And he seems jealous of Larryboth regarding you and regarding the
bunch

He thinks he can run the bunch just as well as Larry Barneys clever
all right and has plenty of nervebut hes not in Larrys class Not
by a million miles

Hunt perceived that this daring worlddefying embryonically beautiful
model of his had idealized the homecoming nephew of the Duchess into her
especial hero Hunt said no more but painted rapidly Night had fallen
outside and long since he had switched on the electric lights He
seemed not at all finicky in this matter of light he had no supposedly
indispensable north light and midday or midnight were almost equally
apt to find him slashing with brush or scratching with crayon

Presently the Duchess entered No word was spoken The Duchess
noteworthy for her mastery of silence sank into a chair a bent and
shrunken image nothing seemingly alive about her but her faintly
gleaming deepset eyes Several minutes passed then Hunt lifted the
canvas from the easel and stood it against the wall

Thats all for today Maggie he announced pushing the easel to one
side Duchess you and this wild young thing spread the banquettable
while I wash up

He disappeared into a corner shut off by burlap curtains From within
there issued the sound of splashing water and the sputtering roar of
snatches of the Toreadors song in a very big and very bad baritone

Maggie put out a hand and kept the Duchess from rising Sit
stillIll fix the table

Silently the Duchess acquiesced Maggie had never felt any tenderness
toward this strange silent woman with whom she had lived for three
years but it was perhaps an indication of qualities within Maggie
whose existence she herself never even guessed that she instinctively
pushed the old woman aside from tasks which involved any physical
effort Maggie now swung the back of a laundry bench up to form a
tabletop and upon it proceeded to spread a cloth and arrange a medley
of chipped dishes As she moved swiftly and deftly about the Duchess
watching her with immobile features these two made a strangely
contrasting pair one seemingly spent and at lifes grayest end the
other electric with vitality and giving off the essence of lifes
unknown adventures

Hunt stepped out between the curtains pulling on his coat Youll find
that chow in my fireless cooker will beat the Ritz he boasted The
tenderest fattest kind of a fatted calf for the returned prodigal

Maggie started The prodigal You meanLarry is coming

Sure grinned Hunt Thats why we celebrate

Maggie wheeled upon the Duchess Is Larry really coming

Yes said the old woman

Butbut why the uncertainty about when he was coming back Father and
Barney thought he was due to get out yesterday

Just a mistake we all made about his release His time was up this
afternoon

But you told Barney and my father you hadnt heard from him

I had heard said the Duchess in her flat tone If they want to see
him they can see him tomorrow

Whenwhen will he be here

Any minute said the Duchess

Without a word Maggie whirled about and the next moment she was in her
room on the floor below She did not know what prompted her but she had
a frantic desire to get out of this plain shirtwaist and skirt and into
something that would be striking She considered her scanty wardrobe
her father had recently spoken of handsome gowns and furnishings but as
yet these existed only in his words and the pseudoevening gowns which
she had worn to restaurant dances with Barney she knew to be cheap and
uneffective

Suddenly she remembered the things Hunt had given her or had loaned
her the evening four months earlier when he had taken her to
an artists masquerade ballthough to her it had been a bitter
disappointment when Hunt had carried her away before the unmasking at
twelve oclock She tore off the offending waist and skirt pulled from
beneath the bed the pasteboard box containing her costume and in five
minutes of flying hands the transformation was completed Her thick hair
of burnished black was piled on top of her head in gracious disorder
and from it swayed a scarlet paper flower About her lithe body over a
black satin skirt swathing her in its graceful folds clung a Spanish
shawl of saffroncolored background with long brown silken fringe and
flowered all over with brown and red and peacock blue and held in place
by three huge barbaric pins jeweled with colored glass one at either
hip and upon her right shoulder leaving her smooth shoulders bare and
free With no more than a glance to get the hasty effect she hurried up
to the studio

Hunt whistled at sight of her but made no remark Flushed she looked
back at him defiantly The Duchess gave no sign whatever of being aware
of the transformation

Maggie with excited touches tried to improve her setting of the
table aquiver with expectancy and suspense at the nearness of the
meetingevery nerve of audition strained to catch the first footfall
upon the stairs Hunt watching her could but wonder in case Larry was
the clever dashing person that had been described what would be the
outcome when these two natures met and perhaps joined forces




CHAPTER IV


While the preparations for dinner were going on in the studio down
below Larry turned a corner and swung up the narrow street toward the
pawnshop He halted and peered in before entering in doing this he was
obeying the caution that was his by instinct and training

Leaning over the counter within and chatting with his grandmothers
assistant was Casey one of the two plainclothesmen who had arrested
him Larry drew back He was not afraid of Casey or of Gavegan Caseys
partner or of the whole police force or of the State of New York they
had nothing on him he had settled accounts by having done his bit All
the same he preferred not to meet Casey just then So he went down the
street crossed the cobbled plaza along the waterfront and slipped
through the darkness among the trucks out to the end of the pier Under
his feet the East River splashed sluggishly against the piles but out
near the rivers center he could see the tide swirling out to sea at six
miles an hour toward the great shadowy Manhattan Bridge crested with
its splendid tiara of lights

He stretched himself and breathed deeply of the warm free spring It
tasted good after two long years of the prisons sealed air He would
have liked to shed his clothing and dive down for a brisk fight with the
tingling water Larry had always taken pleasure in keeping his body fit
He had not cared for the gymnasiums of the ward clubs where he would
have been welcome in them there had been too much rough horseplay and
foulness of mouth and such had always been offensive to him And
though he had ever looked the gentleman he had known that the New York
Athletic Club and other similar clubs were not for him they pried a bit
too much into a candidates social and professional standing So he had
turned to a club where really searching inquiries were rarely made
for years he had belonged to a branch of the YMCA located just off
Broadway and had played handball and boxed with chunky slowfooted
city detectives who were struggling to retain some physical activity
and with fat playwrights and with Jewish theatrical managers and with
the few authentic Christians who occasionally strayed into the place and
seemed ill at ease therein He had liked this club for another reason
his sense of humor had often been highly excited by the thought of his
being a member of the YMCA

Having this instinct for physical fitness he had not greatly minded
being a coalpasser during the greater part of his stay at Sing Sing
better that than working in the knitting mills so that now though
underfed and under weight he was active and hardmuscled

Larry Brainard could not have told why and just when he had turned
to devious ways He had never put that part of his life under the
microscope But the simple facts were that he had become an orphan at
fifteen and a brokers clerk at nineteen after a course in a business
college and that experiences with washsales and such devious and
dubious practices of brokers his high spirits his instinct for
pleasure his desire for big winningsthese had swept him into a wild
crowd before he had been old enough to take himself seriously and
had started him upon a brilliant career of adventures and unlawful
moneymaking in whose excitement there had been no letup until his
arrest He had never thought about such technical and highly academic
subjects as right and wrong up to the day when Casey and Gavegan had
slipped the handcuffs upon him To laugh to dance to plan and direct
clever coups to spend the proceeds gayly and lavishlyto challenge the
police with another daring coup that had been life to him a game that
was all excitement

And now after two years in which there had been plenty of time for
thinking his conscience still did not trouble him on the score of his
offenses He believed and was largely right in this belief that the
suckers he had trimmed had all been out to secure unlawful gain and
to take cunning advantage of his supposedly foolish self and of other
dupes He had been too clever for them that was all in desire and
intent they had been as great cheats as himself So he felt no remorse
over his victims and as for anything he may have done against that
impersonal entity the criminal statutes why the period in prison
had squared all such matters So he now faced life pleasantly and with
carefree soul

Larry had turned away from the dark river and had started to retrace his
way when he saw a man approaching through the darkness Larry paused
The man drew near and halted exactly in front of Larry By the swing of
his body Larry had recognized the man and his own figure instinctively
grew tense

What you doin out here Brainard The voice was peremptory and rough

Throwing kisses over at Brooklyn Larry replied coolly And what are
you doing out here Gavegan

Following you I wanted a quiet word with you Ive been right behind
you ever since you hit New York

I knew you would be You and Casey But you havent got anything on
me

I got plenty on you beforewith Casey helping retorted Gavegan
And Ill get plenty on you againnow that I know you are the main guy
of a clever outfit Youll be starting some smooth gamebut Im going
to be right after you every minute And Ill get you Thats the news I
wanted to slip you

So commented Larry drawlingly Caseys a fairly decent guy
considering his linebut Gavegan I dont see how Casey stands you as
a partner And Gavegan I dont see why the Board of Health lets you
stay around the streetswhen putrefying matter causes so much disease

None of your lip young feller growled Gavegan He stepped closer
bulking over Larry You think you are such a damned smart talker and
such a damned clever schemerbut Ill bet Ill have you locked up in
six months

Anger boiled up within Larry Against all the persons connected with his
arrest trial and imprisonment he had no particular resentment except
against this one man He never could forget the time he and Gavegan he
handcuffed had been locked in a soundproof cell and Gavegan had
given him the third degreein this case a length of heavy rubber hose
applied with a powerful arm upon head and shouldersin an effort to
make him squeal upon his confederates And that third degree was merely
a sample of the material of which Gavegan was made

Larry held his desire in leash So you bet youll get me Ill take
that betany figure you like Ive already got a new game cooked up
Gavegan Cleverer than anything Ive ever tried before

Oh Ill get you Gavegan growled again

Oh no you wont And then Larrys old anger against Gavegan got into
his tongue and made it wag tauntingly You didnt get me the last time
that was a slip and police stools got me All by yourself Gavegan
you couldnt get anything Your brains got flat tires and its motor
doesnt fire and its clutch is broken The only thing about it that
still works is the horn Youve got a hell of a horn Gavegan and it
never stops blowing

A tug was nearing the dock and by its light Larry saw the terrific
swing that the enraged detective started Larry swayed slightly aside
and as Gavegan lunged by Larrys right fist drove into Gavegans
chindrove with all the power of his dislike and all the strength of
five years in a YMCA gymnasium and a year in a prison boilerroom

Gavegan went down and out

Larry gazed a moment at the dim sprawling figure then turned and made
his way off the pier and again to the door of the pawnshop Casey was
gone he could see no one within but Old Isaac the assistant

Larry opened the door and entered Hello Isaac Wheres grandmother

It is not a desirable trait in one connected with a pawnshop that is
also reputed to be a fence to show surprise or curiosity So Isaacs
reply was confined to a few facts and brief direction

Wondering Larry mounted the stairway which opened from the confidential
business room behind the pawnshop It was common enough for his
grandmother to rent out the third floor but to a painter and a crazy
painterthat seemed strange And yet more strange was it for her to be
having dinner with the painter

Larry knocked at the door A big male voice within gave order

Be parlormaid Maggie and see whos there

The door opened and Larry half entered Then he stopped and in surprise
gazed at the flushed gleaming Maggie slender and supple in the folds
of the Spanish shawl

Why Maggie he exclaimed holding out his hand

Larry

She was thrillingly confused by his surprised admiration For a moment
they stood gazing at each other holding hands The clothes given him on
leaving prison were of course atrocious but in all else he measured up
to her dreams lithe wellbuilt handsome a laugh ready on his lips
and the very devil of daring in his smiling grayblue eyes

How you have grown up Maggie he said still amazed

Thats all Ive had to do for two years she returned

Come on in Larry said the Duchess

Larry shut the door bowed with light grace as he had to pass in front
of Maggie and crossed to the Duchess

Hello grandmother he said as though he had last seen her the
day before He held out his hand the left one and she took it in a
mummified claw In all his life he had never kissed his grandmother nor
did he remember ever having been kissed by her

Glad youre back Larry She dropped his hand The mans name is
Hunt

Larry turned to the painter His laughing eyes could be sharp they were
penetratingly sharp now And so were Hunts eyes

Larry held out his hand again the left And so youre the painter

They call me a painter responded Hunt but none of them believe Im
a painter

Larry turned again to Maggie And so youre actually Maggie Meaning
no offenseand there was a smiling audacity in his face that it would
have been hard to have taken offense atI dont see how Old Jimmie
Carlisles daughter got such looks without stealing them

Well then retorted Maggie I dont see how you got your looks
unless

She broke off and bit her tongue She had been about to retort with
the contrast between Larrys face and his shriveled hooknosed
grandmothers They all perceived her intention however

Larry came instantly to her rescue with almost imperceptible ease

Dinner he exclaimed gazing at the miscellany of dishes on the table
Am I invited

Invited said Hunt Youre the guest of honor

Then might the guest of honor beg the privilege of cleaning up a bit
Larry drew his right hand from his coat pocket where it had been all
this while and started to unwind the handkerchief which he had wound
about his knuckles as he had crossed from the pier

Is your hand hurt much Maggie inquired eagerly

Just skinned my knuckles

How

They happened to connect with a flatfoots jaw while he was trying to
make hypnotic passes at me Hes coming to about now Officer Gavegan

Gavegan exclaimed Hunt You picked a tough bird Young man youre
off to a grand starta charge of assault on an officer the very day
they turn you out of jail

Larry smiled Gavegan is a dirty one but hell make no charge of
assault He claims to be heavyweight champion boxer of the Police
Department Put a fine crimp in his reputation wouldnt it if he
admitted in public that hed been knocked out by a fellow barehanded
supposed to be weak from prison life forty pounds lighter Hed get the
grand razoo all along the line Oh Gavegan will never let out a peep

Hell square things in some other way said Hunt

I suppose hell try Larry responded carelessly Wheres the
firstaid room

Hunt showed him through the curtains When he came out Hunt Maggie
and the Duchess were all engaged in getting the dinner upon the table
Additional help would only be interference so Larrys eyes wandered
casually to the canvases standing in the shadows against the walls

Mr Hunt he remarked you seem to have earned a very real reputation
of its sort in the neighborhood Old Isaac downstairs told me you were
crazysaid they called you Nutssaid you were the worst painter that
ever happened

Yeh thats what they say agreed Hunt

They certainly are awful Larry put in Maggie coming to his side
Father thinks they are jokes and father certainly knows pictures Just
look at a few of them

Yeh look at em and have a good laugh invited Hunt

Larry carried the portrait of the Duchess to beneath the swinging
electric bulb and examined it closely Maggie at his shoulder waited
for his mirth and Hunt regarded him with a sidelong gaze But Larry
did not laugh He silently returned the picture and then examined the
portrait of Old Jimmiethen of Maggiethen of the Italian madonna
throned on her curbstone He replaced this last and crossed swiftly to
Hunt Maggie watched this move in amazement

Larry faced the big painter His figure was tense his features hard
with suspicion That moment one could understand why he was sometimes
called Terrible Larry just then he looked a devastating explosion
that was still unexploded

Whats your game down here Hunt he demanded harshly

My game repeated the big painter I dont get you

Yes you do Youre down here posing as a boob who smears up canvases

Whats wrong with that

Only this those are not crazy daubs Theyre real pictures

Eh exclaimed Hunt Maggie stared in bewilderment at the two men

Hunt spoke again What the dickens do you know about pictures Old
Jimmie whos said to be a shark thinks all these things are just
comics

Jimmie only thinks a pictures good after a thousand pressagents have
said its good Larry returned I studied at the Academy of Design for
two years till I learned I could never paint But I know pictures

And you think mine are good

Not in the popular mannertheyre too original But theyre great And
youre a great painter And I want to know

Hurray shouted Hunt and flung an enthusiastic arm about Larry and
began to pound his back Oh boy Oh boy

Larry wrenched himself free Cut that out Then you admit youre a
great painter

Of course Im a great painter shouted Hunt Who should know it
better than I do

Then whats a great painter doing down here Whats the game youre
trying to put over posing as

Listen son Hunt grinned Youve called me and Ive got to show my
cards Only you mustnt ever tellnor must Maggie the Duchess doesnt
talk anyway No need bothering you just now with a lot of details about
myself Its enough to say that people wouldnt pay me except when I did
the usual pretty rot no one believed in the other stuff I wanted to
do I wanted to get away from that bunch I wanted to do real studies
of human people with their real nature showing through So I beat it
Understand so far

But why pose as a dub down here

I never started the yarn that I was a dub The people who looked at my
work and laughed started that talk I didnt shout out that I was
a great artist for the mighty good reason that if I had and had been
believed the people who posed for me either wouldnt have done it or
would have been so selfconscious that they would have tried to look
like some one else and would never have shown me themselves at all
Thinking me a joke they just acted natural Which young man is about
all you need to know

Maggie looked on breathlessly at the two men bewildered by this new
light in which Hunt was presented and fascinated by the tense alertness
of her hero Larry

Slowly Larrys tensity dissipated I dont know about the rest of your
makeup he said slowly but as a painter youre a whale

The rest of hims all right too put in the dry unemotional voice of
the Duchess Dinners ready Come on

As they moved to the table Hunt clapped a big hand on Larrys shoulder
And to think he chuckled it took a crook fresh from Sing Sing to
discover me as a great artist Youre clever Larryclever Maggie get
the corkscrew into action and fill the glasses with the choicest vintage
of H2O A toast Heres to Larry




CHAPTER V


The dinner was simple beef stewed with potatoes and carrots and onions
and pie and real coffee But it measured up to Hunts boast the chef
of the Ritz limited to so simple a menu could indeed have done no
better And Larry after his prison fare was dining as dine the gods

The irrepressible Hunt trying to read this new specimen that had come
under his observation sought to draw Larry out Barney Palmer and
Old Jimmie were here this afternoon wanting to see you Theyve got
something big waiting for you I suppose youre all ready to jump in and
put it over with a wallop

Im going to put something over with a wallopbut I guess business
will have to wait until Barney Jimmie and I have a talk Can you spare
me a little more of that stew

His manner of speaking was a quiet announcement to Hunt that his plans
were for the present a closed subject Hunt felt balked for this lean
alert muchtalkedof adventurer piqued him greatly but he switched to
other subjects and during the rest of the meal did most of the talking
The Duchess was silent and seemingly was concerned only with her
food Larry got in a fair portion of speech but for the most part his
attention except for that required for eating was fixed upon Maggie

How she had sprung up since he had last seen her Almost a woman
nowand destined to be a beauty And more than just a beauty she was
colorful vital highstrung Before he had gone away he had regarded
her with something akin to the negligent affection of an older brother
But this thing which was already beginning to surge up in him was
altogether different and he knew it

As for Maggie when she looked at him she flushed and her eyes grew
bright Larry was backthe brilliant daring Larry She was aware that
she had been successful in startling and gripping his attention Yes
they would do great things together

When the dinner was finished and the dishes washed Larry gave voice to
this new urge that had so quickly grown up within him

What do you say Maggie to a little walk

All right she replied eagerly

They went down the narrow stairway together On the landing of the
second floor which contained only Maggies bedroom and the Duchesss
and a tiny kitchen Maggie started to leave him to change into street
clothes but he caught her arm and said Come on They descended the
next flight and came into the back room behind the pawnshop which the
Duchess used as a combination of sittingroom office and storeroom
About this musty museum hung or stood unredeemed seamens jackets men
and womens evening wear banjos guitars violins umbrellas and one
huge green stuffed parrot sitting on top of the Duchesss safe

I wanted to talk not walk he said Lets stay here

He took her hands and looked down on her steadily Under the yellow
gaslight her face gleamed excitedly up into his her breath came
quickly

Well sir what do you think of me she demanded Have I changed
much

Changed Why its magic Maggie I left you a schoolgirl youre a
woman now And a wonder

You think so She flushed with pride and pleasure and a wildness of
spirit possessed her and demanded expression in action She freed
her left hand and slipped it over Larrys shoulder Come onlets
twostep

But Maggie Ive forgotten

Come on

Instantly she was dragging him over the scanty floor space But after a
moment he halted protesting

These prison brogans were not intended by their builders for such
work If youve got to dance youll have to work it out of your system
alone

All right

At once in the midst of the dingy room humming the music she
was doing Carmens dancewild provocative alluring It was not a
remarkable performance in any professionally technical sense but it had
vivid personality she was light lithe graceful flashing with color
and spirits

Maggie he exclaimed when she had finished and stood before him
glowing and panting Good Where did you learn that

In the chorus of a cabaret revue

Is that what youre doing now working in a chorus

No Barney and father said a chorus was no place for me She drew
nearer Oh Larry Ive such a lot to tell you

Go on

Wellshe cocked her head impishlyIve been going to school

Going to school Where

Lots of places Just now Im going to school at the Ritzmore Hotel

At the Ritzmore Hotel He stared at her bewildered What are you
learning there

To be a lady She laughed at his increasing bewilderment A real
lady Larry she went on excitedly Oh its such a wonderful idea
Father had never seemed to think much of me till the night I went to
a masquerade ball with Mr Hunt and he and Barney saw me in these
clothes They had never seen me really dressed up before Barney said it
was an eyeopener They saw how I could be of big use to you all But to
be that Ive got to be a ladya real lady who knows how to behave and
wear real clothes Thats what theyre doing now making me a lady

Making you a lady exclaimed Larry How

By putting me where I can watch real ladies and study them Barney cut
short my being in a chorus Barney said a chorus girl never learned to
pass for a lady So Ive been working in places where the swellest women
come First in a milliner shop then as dresser to a model in the shop
of a swell modiste always watching how the ladies behave Now Im at
the Ritzmore and I carry a tray of cigarettes around the tables at
lunch and at teatime and during dinner and during the aftertheater
supper Im supposed to be there to sell cigarettes but Im really
there to watch how the ladies handle their knives and forks and behave
toward the men Isnt it all awfully clever

Why Maggie he exclaimed

And pretty soon when Ive learned more she continued rapidly Im
going to have swell clothes of my ownand be a ladyand get away from
this dingy stuffy dead old place I cant stand for being buried down
here much longer And oh Larry Im going to begin to work with you

What he blinked not yet quite understanding

You think Im not clever enough But I am she protested I tell you
Ive learned a lot And Barney and father have let me help in a lot of
thingsnothing really big yet of course They think Im going to be
a wonder Just today father was saying that you and I teamed upWhy
whats the matter Larry

You and Iteamed up he repeated slowly

Yes Dont you like the idea

His hands suddenly gripped her bare shoulders

Theres nothing to it he exclaimed almost savagely

Whats that she cried startled

I tell you theres nothing to it

Youyou think I cant put it over

You cant And Im not going to have it

Whywhy

Staring she drew slowly away from him His face which a few moments
before had been smiling was now harsh and dominant with decision
She had heard him spoken of as Laughing Larry and also as Terrible
Larry whose aroused will none could brook He looked this latter person
now and she could not understand

But though she could not understand her own defiant spirit stormed up
to fight this unexpected opposition He didnt believe in herthat was
it He didnt think she was equal to working with him Her young figure
stiffened in angered pride and her mind was gathering hot phrases
to fling at him when the door from the pawnshop began to creak open
Instantly Larry turned toward it relaxed and yet alert for anything
Old Jimmie and Barney Palmer entered

Hello Larry cried the old man crossing Welcome to our city

Hello Jimmie Hello Barney And Larry shook hands with his partners
of other days

Gee Larry its good to see you exclaimed the cunningeyed old man
Didnt know you were back till I bumped into Gavegan on Broadway He
told me and so Barney and I beat it over here to see you Believe me
Larry that flatfoot is certainly sore at you

Larry ignored the last sentence Think it exactly wise for you two to
come here

Why Larry

Gavegan Casey the police may follow thinking youve come to see me
for some purpose That outfit may act upon suspicion

Jimmie grinned cunningly A man can come to visit his own daughter as
often as he likes Father love Larry

I see thatll be your explanation Larrys eyes grew keen at the new
understanding I hadnt thought of that before Jimmie So thats why
youve always boarded Maggie around in shady joints sos you could meet
your pals and yet always have the excuse that you had come to meet your
daughter

Partly that smiled Old Jimmie blandlyperhaps too blandly Suppose
we sit down

They did so Maggie sitting a little apart from the men and regarding
Larry with indignant questioning eyes She still could not understand
his queer behavior when she had announced her intention of working with
him Could it be as her father had said because he would never work
with womennot trusting them Shed show him

She was so occupied with this wonderment that she gave no heed to the
talk about Larrys experience in Sing Sing and Old Jimmies recital of
what had happened among Larrys friends during his absence During this
gossip the Duchess entered from the stairway and without word to any
one shuffled across to her desk in a corner and bent silently over her
accounts just one more grotesque and unredeemed pledge in this museum
of antiquities and forgotten pawns

Presently Barney Palmer who had been impatient during all this broke
out with

Aw lets cut out this chatter about what used to be and get down to
cases Jimmie will you spill the business to Larry or want me to

Ill tell him Listen Larry Maggie pricked up her ears the talk was
now excitingly important Weve got our very greatest game all planned
out Stockselling game going to unload the whole thing on one sucker
and weve got the sucker picked out Besides you and Barney and me
theres Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt in ita classy bunch all
right And we think that for the woman end well take in Mae Gorham
Shes clever and innocenteyed

But I thought you were going to take me in protested Maggie

Maggiell be just as good as Mae Gorham put in Barney

Well let that pass said Old Jimmie The main thing Larry is that
everything is ready Its a whale of a business proposition Weve been
waiting for you youre all thats lackingthe brainy guy to sit behind
the scenes and manage the thing Youve handled the bunch for a long
time and they want you to handle this For youre sure a wonder at
business Larry None keener Well weve held this off waiting for you
for a month How about jumping right in

All three eyed Larry His lean face was expressionless He lit a
cigarette rose and leaned against the Duchesss safe on which stood the
green parrot and gaze on the floor slowly exhaled smoke through his
nostrils

Well demanded Barney

Larry looked at the two men with quiet even eyes Thanks to both of
you Its a great compliment But Ive had time to do a little planning
myself up in Sing Sing and Ive worked out a game thats got this one
beat a mile

Hell ejaculated Barney in wrathful disgust Jimmie I told you we
were wasting time waiting for him

Hold on a second Barney If Larrys worked out a better game hell
take us into it But Larry how can your game beat this one

Because theres more money in it And because its safer

Safe Aw hell The smouldering jealousy and hatred glared out
of Barneys greenish eyes I always knew you had a yellow streak
Something safe Aw hell

Dont blow up Barney What is the new game Larry queried the old
man

Larry regarded the two men steadfastly He seemed reluctant to speak

Well prompted Old Jimmie Is it something you dont want to let us
in on

Of course Ill let you in on it and be glad to if you want to come
in Larry replied in his level tone As I said Ive thought it all
out and its a great proposition Heres the game Im going to run
straight

For a moment all three sat astounded by this quiet statement from their
leader Nothing he might have said could have been more unexpected more
stupefying The Duchess alone moved she turned her head and held her
sunken eyes upon her grandson

Simultaneously the two men and Maggie stood up

The hell you say grated Barney Palmer

Larry you gone crazy cried Old Jimmie

Maggie moved a pace nearer him Going to go straight she asked
incredulously

Listen all of you Larry said quietly No Jimmie Ive not gone
crazy Im merely going a little sane You just said I was a wonder
at business Jimmie I think I am myself I thought it all over as a
business proposition Suppose we clean up fifty or a hundred thousand on
a big deal Weve got to split it several ways perhaps pay a big piece
to the police for protection perhaps pay a lot of lawyers and then
perhaps get sent away for a year or several years during which we dont
take in a nickel I figured that over a term of years my average income
was mighty small As a business man it seemed to me that I was in a poor
business with no future So I decided to get into a new business that
had a future Thats the size of it

Youre turning yellowthats the real size of it snarled Barney
Palmer half starting toward him

Better be a little careful Barney Larry warned with tightening jaw

You really mean Larry demanded Old Jimmie that youre going to
drop us after us counting on you and waiting for you so long

Im sorry about having kept you waiting Jimmie But weve parted
definitely Then Larry added Unless you want to travel my road

Your road Never snapped Barney

And you Jimmie Larry inquired his eyes on Barneys inflamed face

I dont see your proposition And Im too old a bird to start something
new No thanks Ill stick to what I know

His next words showing his long yellow teeth were spoken slowly but
they were hard and had a cutting edge Youve got a sweet idea of
whats straight Larry dropping us without a leader just when we need
a leader most

Larrys composed yet watchful gaze was still on Barney Youre not
really left in such a bad way Barney here is ready to take charge

You bet I am Barney flamed at him his hands clenching And the
bunch wont lose by the change you bet The bunch always thought you
were an aceand I always knew you were a twospot And now theyll see
I was rightthat you were always yellow

Larry still leaned against the safe in the same posture of seeming ease
but he expected Barney to strike at any moment and held himself in
readiness for a flashing fist Barney had been hard to hold in leash in
the old days now that all ties of partnership were broken he saw in
those small gleaming eyes a defiance and a hatred that henceforth had
no reason for restraint And he knew that Barney was shrewd grimly
tenacious and limitless in selfconfidence and ambition

And listen to this too Larry Brainard Barneys temper carried him
on Dont you mix in and try any preaching on Maggie He half turned
his head jealously Maggie dont you listen to any of this boobs
Salvation Army talk

Maggie did not at once respond but stood gazing at the two confronting
figures To her they were an oddly dissimilar pair Barney in the
smartest clothes that an oversmart Broadway tailor could create and
Larry in the shapeless garments that were the States gift to him on
leaving prison

Maggie he repeated dont you listen to this boobs talk

Ill do just as I please Barney

But youre going to come our way he demanded

Of course

He turned back to Larry You hear that You leave Maggie alone

Larry did not answer though his temper was rising He looked over
Barneys head at Maggies father

Jimmie he remarked in his same even voice anything more youd like
to say

Im through

Then said Larry better lead your new commanderinchief out of
here or Ill carry him out and spank him

Whats that snarled Barney

Get out Larry ordered in a voice suddenly like steel

Barneys fist swung viciously at Larrys head It did not land because
Larrys head was elsewhere Larry did not take advantage of the opening
to strike back but as the fist flashed by he seized the wrist and
in the same instant he seized the other wrist The next moment he held
Barney helpless in a twisting torturing grip that he had learned from
one of his nonChristian friends at the YMCA

Barneyare you going to walk out or shall I kick you out

Barneys answer came after a moment through gritted teeth Ill walk
outbut Ill get you for this

I know youll try Barney And I know youll try to get me behind my
back Larry loosed his grip Goodnight

Barney backed glowering to the door and Old Jimmie his gray face an
expressionless mask silently followed him out

All this while the Duchess had looked on motionless in her corner a
dingy forgotten part of the dingy backgroundno more noticeable than
one of her own dusty bizarre pledges




CHAPTER VI


For a moment after the door had closed upon Barney and Old Jimmie Larry
stood gazing at it Then he turned to Maggie

She was standing slenderly upright Her head was imperiously high
her black eyes defiant Neither spoke at once More than before was he
impressed by her present and her potential beauty Till this night he
had thought of her only casually as merely a young girl he was not now
consciously in love with herher young womanhood had burst upon him
too suddenly for such a consciousnessbut a warm tingling went through
him as he gazed at her imperious selfconfident youth Part of his mind
was thinking much the same thought that Hunt had considered a few hours
earlier here were the makings of a magnificent adventuress

Maggie he mused you didnt get your looks from your father You
must have had a finelooking mother

I dont knowI never saw her she returned shortly

Poor kid Larry mused onand with only Old Jimmie for a father She
did not know what to say For a long time she had dreamed of this man as
her hero she had dreamed of splendid adventures with him in which she
should win his praise And nowand now

He switched to another subject

So you have decided to string along with your father and Barney

I have

Dont you do it Maggie

Dont you preach Larry

Im not preaching Im just talking business to you The same as I
talked business to myself The crooked game is a poor business for a
woman who can do something elseand you can do something else Ive
known a lot of women in the crooked game Theyve all had a rotten
finish or are headed for one So forget it Maggie Theres more in the
straight game

She had swiftly come to feel herself stronger and wiser than her
exhero In her tremendous pride and confidence of eighteen she
regarded him almost with pitying condescension

Somethings softened your brain Larry I know better The people who
pretend to go straight are just fakes theyre playing a different kind
of a smooth game thats all Everybody is out to get his and get it
the easiest and quickest way he can You know thats so And thats just
what I am going to do

Larry had once talked much the same way but it seemed puzzlingly
strange just now to hear such talk from a young girl Then he
understood

You couldnt help having such ideas Maggie living among crooks
ever since you were a kid Why Old Jimmie could not have used better
methods or got better results if he had set out consciously to make
you a crook Then a sudden possibility came to him Dyou suppose he
could always have had that planto make you into a crook he asked

What difference does that make she demanded shortly

A funny thing for a father to do with his own child Larry returned
But whether Jimmie intended it or not thats just what hes done

What I am I am she retorted with her imperious defiance Just then
she felt that she hated him she quivered with a desire to hurt him he
had so utterly destroyed her romantic hero and her romantic dreams Her
hands clenched

You talk about going straightits all rot she flamed at him A lot
of men say theyre going straight but no one ever does And you wont
either

You think I wont

I know you wont You dont know how to do any regular work And
besides no one will give a crook a chance

She had unerringly placed her finger upon his two great problems and
Larry knew it he had considered them often enough

All the same Im going to make good he declared

Oh no youre not

Perhaps he was stirred chiefly by the sting of her taunting tongue
by the blaze of her dark disdainful eyes and perhaps by the changed
feeling toward this creature whom he had left a halfgrown girl and
returned to find a woman At any rate he crossed and seized her wrists
and gazed fiercely down upon her

I tell you Im going to go straight and Im going to make a success
of it Youll see And then he added dominantly Whats more Im
going to make you go straight too

She made no attempt to free herself but blazed up at him defiantly
Youll make me do nothing Im going to be just what I said and Im
going to make a success of it Just waitIll prove to you what I can
do And youyoull be a failure and will come slinking back and beg us
to take you in

They glared at each other silently angrily their aroused wills defying
each other For a moment they stood so Then somethinga mixture of his
desire to dominate this defiant young thing and of that growing change
in him toward hersurged madly into Larrys head He caught Maggie in
his arms and kissed her

All the rigidity went suddenly from her figure and she hung loose in his
embrace Their gazes held for a moment She went pale and quivering
all through she looked up at him in startled wideeyed silence As
for Larry a dizzying throbbing emotion permeated his whole astonished
being

Suddenly she pushed herself free from his relaxing arms and backed away
from him

What did you do that for she whispered huskily

But she did not wait for his answer She turned and hurried for the
stairway Three steps up she turned again and gazed down upon him Her
cheeks were once more flushed and her dark eyes blazing

Its going to be just as I said she flung at him Im going to
succeedyoure going to fail You just wait and see

She turned and ran swiftly up the stairway and out of sight Neither of
them had been aware that the Duchess a drab figure merged into a drab
background had regarded them fixedly during all this scene And Larry
was still unconscious that the old eyes were now watching him with their
deepset expressionless fixity

Motionless Larry stood gazing at where Maggie had been Within him was
tumult he did not yet understand the significance of that impulsive
kiss He began to walk the floor his mind and will now more in
control Yes he was going to go straight he was going to make good
and make good in a big way And he was going to make Maggie go straight
too Hed show her It wasnt going to be easy but he had his big plan
made and he had determination and he knew hed win in the end Yes
hed show her

Up before the mirror Maggie sat looking intently at herself Part of
her consciousness was wondering about that kiss and part kept fiercely
repeating that shed show himshed show himshed show him

Looking thus into their futures they were both very certain of
themselves and of the roads which they were to travel




CHAPTER VII


Larry was still gazing at where Maggie had stood flashing her defiance
at him when Hunt came thumping down the stairway

Hello young fellow what you been doing to Maggie demanded the
painter

Why

Her door was open when I came by and I called to her She didnt
answer but oh what a look Whats in the air

And then Hunt noted the Duchess apart in her corner I say
Duchesswhat were Larry and Maggie rowing about

Grandmother Larry exclaimed with a start Id forgotten you were
here You must have heard it allgo ahead and tell him

Tell him yourself returned the Duchess

Larry and Hunt took chairs and Larry gave the gist of what he had said
about his decision to Barney and Old Jimmie and Maggie The Duchess
still motionless at her desk as she had been all during Larrys scene
with Old Jimmie and Barney and then his scene with Maggie regarded
her grandson with that emotionless mummified face in which only the
redmargined eyes showed life or interest

So youre going to go straight eh queried Hunt The big painter sat
with his long legs sprawling in front of him a black pipe in his mouth
and looked at Larry skeptically You certainly did hand a jolt to your
friends whod been counting on you And yet youre sore because they
were sore at you and didnt believe in you

Did I say that I was sore queried Larry

No but youre acting it And youre sore at Maggie because she didnt
believe that you could make good or that youd stick it out Well I
dont believe you will either

Youre a great painter Hunt and a great cookbut I dont give a damn
what you believe

Keep your shirt on young fellow Hunt responded puffing
imperturbably I say I believe you wont win outbut thats not saying
I dont want you to win out If thats what you want to do go to it
and may luck be with you and may the devil stay in hell The morals of
other people are out of my linenone of my business Im a painter and
its my business to paint people as I find them But Maggie certainly
did put her finger on the tough spot in your proposition for a crook to
find a job and win the confidence of people Its up grade all the way
and it takes ten mens nerve to stick it out to the top Yep Maggie was
sure right

And then the Duchess broke her accustomed silence with her thin croak

Never you mind Maggie She thinks she knows everything but she doesnt
know anything

Larry looked in surprise at his grandmother There was a flash in her
old eyes but the next moment the spark was gone

Sure youre up against itbut Ill be rooting for you Hunt was
grinning But say young fellow what made you decide to vote the other
ticket

Larry was trained at reading faces and in the roughhewn grinning
features of Hunt he read goodfellowship Larry swiftly responded in
kind for from the moment he had pulled the mask of being a fool from
the painter and shown him to be a real artist he had felt drawn toward
this impecunious swashbuckler of the arts So he now repeated the
business motives which he had presented to Barney and Old Jimmie As
Larry talked he became more spontaneous and after a time he was telling
of the effect upon him of seeing various shrewd men locked up and
unexercised in prison And presently his reminiscence settled upon one
prison acquaintance a man past middle age clever in his generation
who had already done some fifteen years of a long sentence He was said
Larry grim and he rarely spoke but a close wordless friendship had
developed between them Only once in an unusually relaxed mood had
the old convict spoken of himself but what he had then said had had a
greater part in rousing Larry to his new decision than the words of any
other man

It was a queer story Joe let out continued Larry Before he was
sent away he had a kid just a baby whose mother was dead He told me
he wanted to have his kid brought up without ever knowing anything about
the kind of people he knew and the kind of life hed lived He wanted it
to grow up among decent people He had money put away and he had an
old friend a pal that hed trust with anything So he turned over his
money and his baby to his friend and gave orders that the kid was to
be brought up decent sent to school and that the kid was never to
know anything about Joe Of course the baby was too young then ever to
remember him and when he gets out hes going to keep absolutely clear
of the kids lifehe wants his kid to have the best possible chance

What is his whole name and what was he sent up for queried the
Duchess that flickering fire of interest once more in her old eyes

Joe Ellison He was an oldtime confidence man He got caught in
a jamthere had been drinkingthere was some shootingand he had
attempted manslaughter tacked on to the charge of swindling But Joe
said everybody had been drinking and that the shooting was accidental

Joe EllisonI knew him said the Duchess He was about the cleverest
man of his day But I never knew he had a child Who was this best
friend of his

Joe Ellison didnt mention his name answered Larry You see Joe
spoke of his story only once But he then said that hed had letters
once a month telling how fine the kid was getting ontill three or
four years ago when he got word that his friend had died The way things
stand now Joe wont know how to find the kid when he gets out even if
he should want to find itand he wouldnt know it even if he saw it
Up in Sing Sing when I had nothing else to do concluded Larry I
tell you I thought a lot about that situationfor it certainly is some
situation Joe Ellison for fifteen years in prison with just one big
idea in his life the idea being the one thing he felt he was really
doing or ever could do his very life built on that one idea
that outside somewhere was his kid growing up into a fine young
personnever guessing it had such a fatherand Joe never intending to
see it again and not being able to know it if he ever should see it
I tell you after learning Joes story it made me feel that Id had
enough of the old life

Again the Duchess spoke Did Joe ever mention its name

No he just spoke of it as his kid

Larry was quiet a moment You see he added I want to get settled
before Joe comes outhis times up in a few monthsso that I can give
him some sort of place near me Hes all right Joe is but hes too
old to have any show at a fresh start if he tries to make it all on his
own

Larry you havent got such a tough piece of old brass for a heart
yourself commented Hunt What are your own plans

I know Ive got the makings of a real business manIve already told
you that said Larry confidently He had thought this out carefully
during his days as a coalpasser and his long nights upon the
eighteeninch bunk in his cell Ive got a lot of the finishing
touches I know the high spots What I need are the rudimentsthe
fundamentalsconnecting links You see I had part of a business
college training a long time before I went to work in a brokers office
stenography and typewriting Ive been a secretary in the wardens
office the last few months and Ive brushed up on the old stuff and
Im pretty good That ought to land me a job Then Im going to study
nights Of course Id get on faster if I could have private lessons
with one of the head men of one of these real business schools Id mop
up this stuff about organization and management mighty quick for that
business stuff comes natural to me A bit of that sort of going to
school would connect up and give a working unity to what I already know
But then Ill find a job and work the thing out some way Im in this to
win out and win out big

Once more the rarely heard voice of the Duchess sounded and though thin
it had a positive quality

Youre not going to take any job at first First thing youre going to
give all your time to those private lessons

Larry gazed at the Duchess surprised by the tone in which she spoke
But grandmother these lessons cost money And I didnt have a thin
dime left when my lawyers finished with me

Ive got plenty of moneyand its yours And the money you get from me
will be honest money too the interest on loans made in my pawnshop
is honest all right Itll be better anyhow for you to be out in the
world a few days getting used to it before you take a job

Why grandmother

The explanation seemed bald and inadequate but Larry did not know what
else to say he was so taken aback The Duchess as far as he had been
able to see had never shown much interest in him And now unless he
was mistaken there was something very much like emotion quavering in
her thin voice and shining in her old eyes

I dont interfere with what people want to do she continuedbut
Larry Im glad youve decided to go straight

And then the Duchess went on to make the longest speech that any living
person had ever heard issue from her lips and to reveal more than
had yet been heard of that unmysterious mystery which lived within her
shriveled misshapen figure

Thats what made me interested in Joe Ellisons storyhis wanting to
get his child clear of the life he was living though I didnt know he
had any such ideas till you told me Larry I couldnt get out of this
life myself I was part of it I belonged to it But I felt the same as
Joe Ellison and over forty years ago I got your mother out of it and
your mother never came back to it I did that much After she died it
made me sick when you all Ive got left began to go crooked But I had
no control over you I couldnt do anything So Im glad that at last
youre going to go straight Im glad Larry

The emotion that had given her voice a strange and increasing vibrance
was suddenly brought under control or snuffed out and she added in her
usual thin mechanical tone The money will be ready for you in the
morning

Startled and embarrassed by this outbreak of things long hidden beneath
the dust in the secret chambers of her being and wishing to avoid
the further embarrassment of thanks the Duchess turned quickly and
awkwardly back to her desk and her bent old body became fixed above
her figures In a moment the everalert Hunt had out the little block
of drawingpaper he always carried in a pocket and with swift eager
strokes he was sketching the outline of that bent shrunken shape that
had subsided so swiftly from emotion to the commonplace

Larry gazed at the Duchess in silent bewilderment He had thought he had
known his grandmother He was now realizing that perhaps he did not know
his grandmother at all




CHAPTER VIII


That night Larry slept on a cot set up in Hunts studio Hunt had made
the proposition that Larry consider the studio his headquarters for
the present and Larry had accepted Of course the cot and the
roughandready furnishings of the studio were grotesquely short of the
luxury of those sunny days when Larry had had plenty of easy money and
had been free to gratify his taste for the best of everything but the
quarters were infinitely more luxurious and comfortable than his more
recent threebyseven room at Sing Sing with its damp and chilly stone
walls

There were many reasons why Larry was appealed to by the idea of making
his home for the present in this old house in this dingy unexciting
unromantic street He was drawn toward this bluff outspoken autocratic
painter and was curious about him And then the way his grandmother had
spoken the gleam in her old eyes had stirred an affection for her
that he had never before felt And then there was Maggie with her
startlingly new dusky beauty her admiration of him that had so swiftly
altered to defiance her challenge to a duel of purposes

Yes for the present this dingy old house in this dingy old street was
just the place he preferred to be

It was not the part of wisdom to start forth on the beginning of his new
career in his shapeless prison shoddy so the next day Larry pottered
about the studio acting as maidofallwork while the clothes in his
trunk which had been stored with the Duchess were being sponged and
pressed by the little tailor down the street and while a laundress
driven by the Duchess was preparing the rest of his outfit for his
debut In his capacity of maid with a basket on his arm he went out
into the little street where in his shabby clothes he was recognized by
none and leaned for a time against the mongrel underfed tree that was
hesitatingly greeting the spring with a few halfhearted leaves He
bathed himself in the warm sun which seemed overglorious for so mean
a street he filled his lungs with the tangy May air yes it was
wonderful to be free again

Then he strolled about the street on his business of marketing It
amused him to be buying three pounds of potatoes and a pound of
chopped meat and a package of macaroni and to be counting Hunts
penniesremembering those days when he had been a personage to head
waiters and had had his table reserved and with a careless Midass
gesture had left a dollar or five or twenty for the waiters tip

When he climbed back into the studio he watched Hunt slashing about with
his paint Hunt growled and roared at him and kidded him and Larry
came back at him with the same kind of verbal horseplay after the
fashion of men Presently a relaxation if not actual friendship began
to develop in their attitude toward each other

Tell you what Larry remarked standing with legs wide apart gazing at
the picture of the Italian mother throned on the curb nursing her child
if I were dolled up all proper I bet I could take some of this stuff
out and sell it for real dough

Huh nobody wants that stuff snorted Hunt Its too good Sell it
Youre off your bean young fellow

I can sell anything my bucko Larry returned evenly All I need is
a man who has plenty of money and a moderate willingness to listen
Ive sold pictures of an oil derrick on a stock certificate exact value
nothing at all for a masterpieces priceso I guess I could sell a
real picture

Aw you shut up

The real trouble with you commented Larry is that though you can
paint as a business man as a promoter of your own stock the suckling
infant in that picture is a J Pierpont Morgan of multiplied capacity
compared to

Stop making that noise like a damned fool

This amiable pastime of throwing stones at each other was just then
interrupted by the entrance of Maggie for an appointed sitting before
going to her business of carrying a tray of cigarettes about the
Ritzmore She gave Hunt a pleasant goodmorning the pleasantness
purposely stressed in order to make more emphatic her curt nod to Larry
and the cold hostility of her eye During the hour she posed Larry
moving leisurely about his kitchen duties addressed her several times
but no remark got a word from her in response He took his rebuffs
smilingly which irritated her all the more

Maggie Ill get my real clothes late this afternoon how about my
dropping in at the Ritzmore for a cup of tea and letting me buy some
cigarettes and talk to you when youre not busy he inquired when Hunt
had finished with her

You may buy cigarettes but youll get no talk she snapped and head
high and dark eyes flashing contempt she swept past him

Hunt watched her out As the door slammed behind her he remarked dryly
his eyes searching Larry keenly

Our young queen doesnt seem wildly enthusiastic about you or your
programme

She certainly is not

Dont let that worry you young fellow Thats a common trait of her
whole tribe women simply cannot believe in a man

There was an emphasis and a cynicism in this last remark which caused
Larry to regard the painter searchingly You seem to know what it is
Dont mean to butt in Hunt if there are any trespassing signs upbut
theres a woman in your case

Of course there istheres always a woman thats another reason Im
here Hunt answered She didnt believe in medidnt believe I could
paintdidnt believe in the things I wanted to doso I just picked up
my playthings and walked out of her existence

Wife queried Larry

Thank God no exclaimed Hunt emphatically NoI thank
whatever gods there be I am the captain of my soul Oh shes all
rightaltogether too good for me he added Here try this tobacco

Larry picked up the pouch flung him and accepted without remark this
being abruptly shunted off the track But he surmised that this woman
in the background of Hunts life meant a great deal more to the painter
than Hunt tried to indicate by his attempt to dismiss her casuallyand
Larry wondered what kind of woman she was and what the story had been

The following day cleanshaven and in his freshened clothesthey were
smart and welltailored though sober indeed compared with Barneys
and two years behind the style of which Barneys were the extreme
expressionLarry passed Maggie on the stairway with a smile who
gave him no smile in return and started forth upon his quest He was
welldressed he had money in his pockets he had a plan and the air
of freedom of a new life was sweet in his nostrils He was going to
succeed

It was easy enough with his mind alert for what he wanted and with the
Duchesss liberal allowance to pay for what he wanted for Larry to find
in this city of ten thousand institutes teaching business methods
the particular article which suited his especial needs He found this
article in an institute whose blackfaced headline in its advertisements
was We Make You a 50000 Executive and the article which he found
by payment of a special fee was an old man who had been the manager of
a big brokerage concern until his growing addiction to drink and later
to drugs had rendered him undependable But old Bronson certainly did
know the fundamentals and intricacies of the kind of big business which
is straight and it was a delight to him to pour out his knowledge to a
keen intelligence

Larry in his own words simply mopped it up His experience had been
so wide and varied that he now had only to be shown a bone of fact
and almost instantly he visioned in their completeness unextinct
ichthyosauri of business By day he fairly consumed old Bronson he read
dry books far into the night Thus he rapidly filled the holes in the
walls of his knowledge and strengthened its rather sketchy foundation
Of course he realized that what he was learning was in a sense academic
it had to be tested and developed and made flexible by experience but
then much of it became instantly a living enlargement of the things of
which he was already a master

Old Bronson was delighted he had never had so apt a pupil In less
than no time youll be the real head of that house youre with he
proudly declared Larry had not seen it as needful to tell the truth
about himself his casual story was that he was there putting to use a
months holiday granted him by a mythical firm in Chicago

The Duchesss statement that it would be best for him not to seek work
at once was founded on wisdom Larry was busy and interested but he
did not yet have to face the constant suspicion and hostility which are
usually the disheartening lot of the exconvict who asks for a position
In this period his confidence and his purpose expanded with new
vitality

As the busy days passed down in the little street the bantering
fellowship between Larry and Hunt took deeper root The Duchess did
not again show any of the emotion which had gleamed in her briefly when
Larry had announced his new plan but bent and silent went like an oddly
revivified mummy about her affairs And during these days he did not
again see Barney or Old Jimmie he had learned that on the day following
his conference with them they had gone to Chicago on a very private
matter of business

He saw Maggie daily but she maintained the same attitude toward him He
was now conscious that he was in love He saw splendid qualities in her
most of them latent Maggie had determination high spirits cleverness
courage and capacity for sympathy and affection she had head heart
and beauty the makings of an unusual woman if only she could be swung
into a different attitude of mind But he realized that there was small
chance indeed of his working any alteration in her much less winning
her admitted regard until he was definitely a success until he had
definitely proven himself right So he took her rebuffs with a smile
and waited his time

He understood her point of view and sympathized with her for her point
of view had once been his own With a growing understanding he saw her
as the natural product of such a fathership as Old Jimmies and of the
cynical environment which Old Jimmie had given her in which crime was
a matter of course In this connection one matter that had previously
interested him began to engage his speculation more and more All
her life until recently Old Jimmie had apparently shown little more
concern over Maggie than one shows over a piece of baggage which is
stored in this and that warehouseand so valueless a piece of baggage
in Old Jimmies case that it had always been stored in the worst
warehouses What was behind Old Jimmies new interest in his daughter

Old Jimmie had in late months awakened to the value to him of Maggie as
a business propositionthat was Larrys answer to his own question

As for Maggie during these days the mere fact that Larry smiled at her
and refused to get angry angered her all the more Her anger at him
the manner in which he had refused her offered and longdreamedof
partnership would not permit her pride and selfconfidence to consider
any justification for him to enter her mind and argue in his behalf The
great dream she had nourished had been destroyed And moreover he had
proclaimed himself a fool

Yes despite him and all he could do she was going to go the brilliant
exciting way she had planned

In fairness to Maggie it must be remembered that despite her assumed
maturity and selfconfident wisdom she really was only eighteen and
perhaps did not yet fully know herself and had all the world yet to
learn And it must be remembered that she believed herself entirely
in the right This was a world where strength and cunning were the
qualities that counted and every one was trying to outwit his neighbor
and all who acted otherwise were either weakwitted fools or else
pretenders who saw in their hypocrisy the keenest game of all Living
under the influence of Old Jimmie and later of Barney and of the
environment in which she had been bred these beliefs had come to be
her religion She was thoroughly orthodox and had the defensive and
aggressive fervor which is the temper of militant orthodoxy

And so more keenly than ever because she was more determined than ever
Maggie studied the groups of welldressed men and women who ate and
danced at the Ritzmore among whom she circulated in her short smart
skirt with her cigarette tray swung from her neck by a broad purple
ribbon Particularly she liked the aftertheater crowd for then only
evening wear was permitted in the supperroom and the people were at
their liveliest She liked to watch the famous professional couple
do their specialties on the glistening central space with the agile
spotlights always bathing them and then watch the smartly dressed
guests take the floor with the less practiced and more humble steps
Sometime soon she was going to have clothes as smart as any of these
Soon she would be one of these brilliant people and have a life more
exciting than any Very soonfor her apprenticeship was almost over

Barney Palmer had these last few months since he had discovered in
Maggie a star who only needed coaching and then an opportunity made it
a practice to come for Maggie occasionally when one oclock New Yorks
curfew hour dispersed the pleasureseekers and ended Maggies day of
work or rather her day of intensive schooling for her greater life On
the night of his return from Chicago which was a week after his break
with Larry Barney reported to take Maggie home He was in swagger
evening clothes and he asked the starter for a taxi with an almost
lordly air and for the service of a whitegloved gesture to a chauffeur
he carelessly handed the starter who by the way was a richer man
than Barney a crisp dollar bill Barney was trying to make his best
impression

Seen much of that stiff Larry Brainard he asked when the cab was
headed southward

His tone which he tried to make merely contemptuous conveyed the deep
wrath which he still felt whenever his mind reverted to Larry Maggie
reserved to herself the privilege of thinking of Larry just as she
pleased but being the kind of girl she was she could not help being
also a bit of a coquette

I didnt think he was such a stiff Barney she said in an
irritatingly pleasant voice His prison clothes were bad but now that
hes dressed right I think he looks awfully nice You and father have
always said he looked the perfect swell

See herehas he been talking to you Barney demanded savagely

A little Yes several times In fact he said quite a lot that night
after youd gone

What did he say

He said he was not only going to go straight butin her provocative
teasing voicehe was going to make me go straight

Whats that Tell me just what he said demanded Barney his wrath
suddenly flaring into furious jealousy

Maggie told him in detail in fact told him the scene in greater detail
and with a greater length than had been the actuality Also she censored
the scene by omitting her own opposition to Larrys determination She
enjoyed playing with Barney the exercise of the power she had over
Barneys passions

And you stood for all that cried Barney By this time they were far
down town You listen to me Maggie What I said to Larrys face that
night at the Duchesss still stands I think hes yellow and has turned
against his old pals I tell you what Im going to watch that guy

You wont find it hard to watch him Barney Larry never hides
himself

Oh Ill watch him all right And you Maggiewhy you talk as though
you liked that line of talk he gave you

Larry talks welland I did like it rather

See here Youre not falling for him Youre not going to let him make
you go straight

Maggie certainly had no intention of letting any such thing come to
pass but she could not check her innocenttoned baiting

How do I know what hell make me do Hes clever and handsome you
know

Barney gripped her shoulder fiercely Maggieare you falling in love
with him

How do I know when

Maggie He gripped her more tightly and his phrases tumbled out
fiercely rapidly Youre not going to do anything of the sort If he
goes straightif you go straighthow can he ever help you He cant
And it will be your finishthe finish of all the big things weve
talked about Listen since Larry threw us down Ive taken hold of
things and will soon be ready to spring something big Just a few days
now and youll be out of that dirty street and youll be in swell
clothes doing swell workand it will mean the best restaurants
theaters swell times

The car had turned into the narrow cobbled street and had paused before
the Duchesss Suddenly Barney caught her into his arms

And Maggie youre going to be mine Well have a nifty little place
all right You know Im dippy about youAnd Maggie I dont even
want you to go back in there where Larry Brainard is Lets drive back
uptown and start in together now Tonight

It was not the fact that he had not suggested marriage which stirred
Maggie men and women in Barneys class lived together and sometimes
they were married and sometimes they were not It was something else
something of which she was not definitely conscious but she felt no
such momentary thrill no momentary dazing surrender as she had felt
the night when Larry had similarly held her

Stop that Barney she gasped Let me go She struggled fiercely
and then tore herself free

Whats wrong with you panted Barney Youre mine aint you

You leave me alone Im going to get out

She had the door open and was stepping out when he caught her sleeve
But she pulled so determinedly that to have held her would have meant
nothing better than ripping the sleeve out of her coat So he freed her
and followed her across the sidewalk to the Duchesss door

Whats the idea he demanded choking with fierce jealousy Its not
Larry after all Youre not going to let him make you go straight

She had recovered her poise and she replied banteringly

As I said how can I tell what hes going to make me do

She heard him draw a deep quivering breath between clenched teeth but
she could not see how his figure tensed and how his face twisted into a
glower

Get this Maggie Larry Brainard is never going to be able to make you
do anything You get that

Yes I get it Barney goodnight she said lightly

And Maggie slipped through the door and left Barney trembling in the
little street




CHAPTER IX


Maggie as she mounted to her room was hardly conscious of the ring
of menace in Barneys voice but once she was in bed his tone and his
words came back to her and stirred a strange uneasiness in her mind
Barney was angry Barney was cunning Barney would stop at nothing to
gain his ends What might be behind his threatening words

The next morning as she was coming in with milk for her breakfast
coffee she met Larry in the Duchesss room behind the pawnshop He
smilingly planted himself squarely in her way

See here Maggiearent you ever going to speak to a fellow

Something within her surged up impelling her to tell him of Barneys
savage yet unformulated threat The warning got as far as her tongue
and there halted struggling

Her strange fixed look startled Larry Why whats the matter
Maggie he exclaimed

But her pride her settled determination to unbend to him in no way and
to have no dealings with him were stronger than her impulse and the
struggling warning remained unuttered

Nothings the matter she said and brushed past him and hurried up
the stairway

At times during the day while tutoring with Mr Bronson Larry thought
of Maggies strange look And his mind was upon it late in the afternoon
when he entered the little street But as he neared his grandmothers
house all such thought was banished by Detective Gavegan of the Central
Office stepping from the pawnshop and blocking the door with his big
figure There was grim triumphant purpose on the hard features of
Gavegan conceited by nature and trained to harsh dominance by long rule
as a petty autocrat

Hello Gavegan Larry greeted him pleasantly Gee but you look
tickled Did the Duchess give you a bigger loan than you expected on the
Carnegie medal you just hocked

Youll soon be cuttin out your line of comedy Gavegan slipped his
left arm through Larrys right Youre comin along with me and youd
better come quiet

Larry stiffened Come where

Headquarters

I havent done a thing Gavegan and you know it What do you want me
for

Me and the Chief had a little talk about you leered Gavegan And now
the Chief wants to have a little personal talk with you He asked me to
round you up and bring you in

Ive done nothing and Ill not go Larry cried hotly

Oh yes you will Gavegan withdrew his right hand from his coat
pocket where it had been resting in readiness In the hand its thong
about his wrist was a short leathercovered object filled with lead
Ive got my orders and youll come peaceably orBut Id just as soon
youd resist for I owe you something for the punch you slipped over on
me the other night

Larry taut with the desire to strike gazed for a moment into the
glowering face of the detective Gavegan gripping his right arm with
that bonecrushing slugshot itching for instant use was apparently
master in the present circumstances But before Larrys quick mind had
decided upon a course the door of the pawnshop opened and closed and a
voice said sharply

Nothing doing on that rough stuff Gavegan The speaker was now on
Larrys left side a heavyfaced man in a black derby Larry better be
a nice boy and come with us

Oh its you Casey said Larry If you say Ive got to go Ill
gofor youre one white copper even if you do have Gavegan for a
partner Come on Whatre we standing here for

The trio made their way out of the narrow street and after some fifteen
minutes of walking through the twisting byways of that part of the city
they passed through the granite doorway at Headquarters and entered the
office of Deputy Commissioner Barlow Chief of the Detective Bureau
Barlow was talking over the telephone in a growling staccato and the
three men sat down After a moment Barlow banged the receiver upon its
hook and turned upon them He had a clenched driving face with small
commanding eyes It was his boast that he got results that it was his
policy to make people do what you told em He had no other code

Well Brainard he snapped here you are again What you up to now

Going to try the straight game Chief returned Larry

Dont try to put that old bunk over on me

Its not bunk Chief Its the real stuff

Cut it out I say Dont you suppose I had a clever bird like you
picked up the minute you landed in the city and have had you covered
ever since And if you are going straight what about the session you
had with Barney Palmer and Old Jimmie Carlisle the very night you blew
in And Im on to this bluff of your going to that business institute
So come across Brainard Ive got your every move covered

Ive already come across Chief replied Larry trying to keep his
temper in the face of the others bullying manner I told Barney and
Old Jimmie that I was through with the old game and through with them
as pals at the old gamethats all there was to that meeting Im going
to that business institute for the same reason that every other person
goes thereto learn Thats all there is to the whole business Chief
Im going to go straight

Chief Barlow hunched forward his undershot jaw clenched on a cigar
stub regarded Larry steadily with his beady autocratic eyes Barlow
was trained to penetrate to the inside of mens minds and he recognized
that Larry was in earnest

You mean you think you are going to go straight Barlow remarked
slowly and meaningly

I know I am going to go straight Larry returned evenly meeting
squarely the gaze of the Chief of Detectives

Do you realize young man Barlow continued in the same measured
significant tone that whether you go straight and how you go
straight depends pretty much on me

Mind making that a little clearer Chief

Ill show you part of my handjust remember that Im holding back my
high cards I dont believe youre going to go straight so well start
with the proposition that youre not going to run straight and work on
from there Youre clever BrainardI hand you that and all the classy
crooks trust you Thats why I had picked you out for what I wanted long
before you left stir Brainard youre wise enough to know that some
of our best pinches come from tips handed us from the inside
Brainardthe slow voice had now become incisive mandatoryyoure
not going to go straight Youre going to string along with Barney and
Old Jimmie and the rest of the bunchwell protect youand youre
going to slip us tips when something big is about to be pulled off

Larry experienced with police methods though he was could hardly
believe this thing which was being proposed to him Larry Brainard But
he controlled himself

If I get you Chief you are suggesting that I become a police stool

Exactly Well never tip your hand And any little thing you pull off
on your own well not bother you about And besides well slip you a
little dough regular on the quiet

And all you want me to do in exchange Larry asked quietly is to
hand up my pals

Thats all

Larry found it required his all of strength to control himself but he
did

There are only three small objections to your proposition Chief

Yes

The first is I shall not be a stool

Whats that

And the second is I wouldnt squeal on a pal to you even if I were a
crook And the third is what I said in the beginning Im not going to
be a crook

Barlows squat powerful figure arose menacingly Casey also stood up

I tell you you ARE going to be a crook Barlows big fist crashed down
on his desk in a tremendous exclamation point And youre going to work
for me exactly as I tell you

I have already given you my final word said Larry

Youyou Barlow almost choked at this quiet defiance His face
turned red his breath came in a fluttering snarl his powerful
shoulders hunched up as if he were about to strike But he held back his
physical blows

Thats your ultimatum

If you care to call it soyes

Then heres mine I told you I was holding back my high cards Either
you do as I say and work with Gavegan and Casey or youll not be able
to hold a job in New York My men will see to that And heres another
high card You do as Ive said or Ill hang some charge on you one
thatll stick and back up the river youll go for another stretch
Theres an ultimatum for you to think about

It certainly was Larry gazed into the harsh glaring face set in
fierce determination He knew that Barlow as part of his policy loved
to break down the spirit of criminals and he knew that nothing so
roused Barlow as opposition from a man he considered in his power Close
beside the Chief he saw the gloating malignant face of Gavegan Casey
who had been restless since the beginning of the scene had moved to the
window and was gazing down into Center Street

For a moment Larry did not reply Barlow mistook Larrys silence for
wavering or the beginning of an inclination to yield

You turn that over in your noodle Barlow drove on Youre going
to go crooked anyhow so you might as well go crooked in the only way
thats safe for you Im going to have Gavegan and Casey watch you and
if in the next few days you dont begin to string along with Barney and
Old Jimmie and that bunch and if you dont get me word that your answer
to my proposition is yes hells going to fall on you Now get out of
here

Larry got out He was liquid lava of rage inside but he had had enough
to do with police power to know that it would help him not at all to
permit an eruption against a police official while he was in the very
heart of the police stronghold

He walked back toward his own street in a fury beneath which was
subconsciously an element of uneasiness an uneasiness which would have
been instantly roused to caution had he known that Barney Palmer had
this hour and more been following him in a taxicab and that across the
street from the cars window Barneys sharp face had watched him enter
Police Headquarters and had watched him emerge

Home reached Larry briefly recounted his experience at Headquarters to
Hunt and the Duchess The painter whistled the Duchess blinked and said
nothing at all

Maggie was more right than she knew when she first said you were facing
a tough proposition exclaimed Hunt Believe me young fellow youre
certainly up against it

Can you beat it for irony said Larry pacing the floor A man wants
to go straight His pals ask him to be a crook and are sore because
he wont be a crook The police ask him to be a crook and threaten him
because he doesnt want to be a crook Some situation

Some situation repeated Hunt Whatre you going to do

Do Larry halted his face set with defiant determination Im going
to keep on doing exactly what Ive been doing And they can all go to
hell




CHAPTER X


For several days nothing seemed to be happening though Larry had a
sense that unknown forces were gathering on distant isothermal lines
and bad weather was bearing down upon him During these days trying
to ignore that formless trouble he gave himself with a most rigid
determination to his new routinethe routine which he counted on to
help him into the way of great things

Every day he saw Maggie sometimes he was in her company for an hour or
more He had the natural hunger of a young man to talk to a young woman
and moreover it is a severe strain for a man to be living under the
same roof with the girl he loves and not to be on terms of friendship
with her But Maggie maintained her aloofness She spoke only when she
was pressed into it and her speech was usually no more than a yes or
a no or a flashing phrase of disdain

At times Larry had the feeling that for all her repression Maggie
would have been glad to be more free with him And he knew enough of
human nature not to be too disheartened by her attitude Had he been
a nonentity to her she would have ignored him Her very insults were
proof that he was a positive personality with real significance in her
life And so he counseled himself to have patience and await a thawing
or an awaking Besides he kept repeating to himself there would
be small chance of effecting a conversion in this militant young
orthodoxist of cynicism until he had proved the soundness of contrary
views by his own established success

And thus the days drifted by But on the fifth day after his interview
with Barlow things began to happen First of all he noticed in a
morning paper that Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt members of his old
outfit and suggested by Old Jimmie as participants in his proposed new
enterprise had just been arrested by Gavegan and Casey on the charge of
alleged connection with the sale of fraudulent mining stock

Second on his return at the end of the afternoon he saw standing
before the house a taxicab with a trunk beside the chauffeur In the
musty museum of a room behind the pawnshop he found Hunt and the Duchess
and Old Jimmie and Barney and also Maggie coming down the stairway
hat and coat on and carrying a suitcase A sharp pain throbbed through
him as he recognized the significance of Maggies hat and coat and
baggage

Maggieyoure going away he exclaimed

Yes

She had paused at the foot of the stairway and at sight of him had gone
a little pale and wideeyed But in an instant she had recovered her
accustomed flair there came a proud lift to her head a flash of scorn
into her dark eyes

At last Im leaving this street for good she said I told you that
some day I was going out into the world and do big things The times
comeIm graduatedIm going to begin real work And Im going to
succeedyou see

Maggie he breathed Then impulsively he started toward her
authoritatively Maggie Im not going to let you do anything of the
sort

But swiftly Barney had stepped in between them Old Jimmie just behind
him

Keep out of this Barney snapped at Larry a reddish blaze in his
eyes Maggies going away and you cant stop her Dyou think her
father is going to let her stay down here any longer where you can
spout your preaching at herand you all the time a stool and a
squealer

Whats that cried Larry

I called you a stool repeated the malignantly exultant Barney alert
for any move on the part of the suddenly tensed Larry And you are
a stool Didnt I see you myself go into Headquarters with Casey and
Gavegan where you sold yourself to Chief Barlow

Why you damned

Even before he spoke Larry launched a furious swing straight from the
hip at Barneys twisted face But Barney had been expecting exactly
that and was even the quicker He caught Larrys wrist before it was
fairly started and thrust a dullhued automatic into Larrys stomach

Behave damn you gritted Barney or Ill blow your damned guts out
Nogo ahead and try to hit me Id like nothing better than to kill
you you rat and have a good plea of selfdefense

Larry let his hands unclench and fall to his sides Youve got the drop
on me Barneybut youre a liar

You bet I got the drop on you And not only with my gun Ive got it
on you about being a stool Everybody knows you are a stool And whats
more they know you are a squealer

A squealer Larry stiffened again

A stool and a squealer Barney fairly hurled at Larry these two most
despised epithets of his world Youve done your job swell as a stool
and squealed on Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt and turned them up for
the police

You believe I had anything to do with their arrest exclaimed Larry

Barney laughed in his derision

Of course we believe it put in Old Jimmie his seamed cunning face
now ruthlessly hard And whats more we know it

And whats still more Barney taunted Maggie believes it too

Larry turned to Maggie Her face was now drawn with staring eyes

Maggiedo you believe it he demanded

For a moment she neither spoke nor moved Then slowly she nodded

But Maggie he protested I didnt do it Barlow did ask me to be
a stool but I turned him down Aside from that I know no more of this
than you do

Of course youd deny itwe were waiting for that sneered Barney
Jimmie weve wasted enough time here Take Maggies bag and lets be
moving on

Old Jimmie picked up Maggies suitcase and slipping a hand through her
arm led her across the room She did not even say goodbye to Hunt or
the Duchess or even glance at them but went out silently her drawn
staring look on Larry alone

Barney backed after them his automatic still held in readiness Im
letting you down damned easy Brainard he said hate glittering in his
eyes But theres some who wont be so nice

With that he closed the door Until that moment both Hunt and the
Duchess had said nothing Now the Duchess spoke up

Im glad theyve taken Maggie away Larry Ive seen the way youve
come to feel about her and shes not the right sort for you

But Larry was still too dazed by the way in which Maggie had walked out
of his life to make any response

But theres a lot in what Barney said about there being some who
wouldnt be easy on you continued the Duchess That word had been
brought me before Barney showed up So I had this ready for you

From a slit pocket in her baggy skirt the Duchess drew out a pistol and
handed it to Larry

Whats this for Larry asked

I was told that word had gone out to the Ginger Buck Gang to get you
answered the Duchess Barney has some secret connection with the Ginger
Bucks His saying that you were a stool and a squealer is not the
only thing hes got against you hes jealous of you on account of
everythingespecially Maggie So youll need that gun

Whats this Ive fallen into the middle of exclaimed Hunt A
Kentucky feud

Its very easy to understand when you know the code Larry explained
grimly Down here when an outfit thinks one of its members has squealed
on them its their duty to be always on the watch for their chance to
finish him off Im to be finished offthats all

Say young fellow the life of a straight crook doesnt seem to be
getting much simpler Why man you hardly dare to stir from the house
What are you going to do

Going to go around my business always with the pleasant anticipation
of a bullet in my back when some fellow thinks it safe for him to
shoot

The three of them discussed this latest development over their dinner
which they had together up in Hunts studio But despite all their talk
of his danger a very real and near danger Larrys mind was more
upon Maggie who had thus suddenly been wrenched out of his life He
remembered her excited boastful talk of their first evening Her period
of schooling was indeed now over she was now committed to her rosily
imagined adventure in which she saw herself as a splendid lady And
with Barney Palmer as her guiding influence

Dinner had been finished and Hunt was trying to give Larry such cheer
as Buck up young fellowyou know the worsttheres nothing else that
can happen when the lie direct was given to his phrases by heavy steps
running up the stairway and the opening and closing of the door There
stood Officer Casey heaving for breath

Instinctively Larry drew his pistol Casey Whatre you here for

Get rid of that gatdont be found with a gun on ordered Casey And
beat it Youve got less than five minutes to make your getaway

My getaway Whats up

You havent come across as the Chief ordered you to and hes out to
give you just what he said he would Casey said rapidly his speech
broken by panting Theres been a stickup with assault that may be
changed to attempted manslaughter and the Chief has three men who swear
youre the guilty party Its a surefire case against you Larryand
itll mean five to ten years if youre caught Gavegan and I got the
order to arrest you Ive beat Gavegan to it sos to tip you off but
hes only a few minutes behind Hurry Larry Onlyonly

Casey paused gasping for his wind

Only what Casey

Only alibi me Larry by slipping over a haymaker on me like you did on
Gavegan Sos I can say I tried to get you but you were too quick and
knocked me cold Quick Only not too hardI know how to play possum

Larry handed the pistol to Hunt Casey youre a real scout Thanks
He grasped Caseys hand then swiftly relaxed his grip Ready

Fire said Casey

Larry held his open left hand close to Caseys jaw and drove his right
fist into his palm with a thudding smack Casey went sprawling to the
floor and lay there loosely with mouth agape in perfect simulation of
a man who has been knocked out

Larry turned quickly You two will testify that I beat Casey up and
then made my escape

Sure Ill testify to anything for the sake of a good old goat like
Casey cried Hunt But hurry boybeat it

The Duchess held out Larrys hat to him and thrust into his coat
pocket a roll of bills which had come from her capacious skirt Hurry
Larryand be carefulfor youre all Ive got

Impulsively Larry stooped and kissed the thin shriveled lips of his
grandmotherthe first kiss he had ever given her Then he turned and
ran down the stairway Hunt just behind him He turned out the light in
the back room and called to Old Isaac to darken the pawnshop proper He
was going forth with two forces in arms against him the police and his
pals and he had no desire to be a shining mark for either or both by
stepping through a lighted doorway

Larry my son youre all right said Hunt gripping his hand in
the darkness Listen boy if ever youre trapped and can get to a
telephone call Plaza ninedoubleoone and say Benvenuto Cellini

All right

Remember youre to say Benvenuto Cellini and the telephone is Plaza
ninedoubleoone Luck to you Again they gripped hands Then Larry
slipped through the darkened doorway into whatever might lie beyond




CHAPTER XI


A misting rain was being swirled about by a temperish wind as Larry
came out into the little street Down toward the river the one gaslight
glowed faintly like an expiring nebula all the little shops were
closed home lights gleamed behind the curtained windows which the storm
had closed so that the street was now a little canyon of uncertain
shadows

Larry had not needed to think to know that Gavegan would be making his
vindictive approach from the westerly regions where lay Headquarters
So keeping in the deeper shadows close to the building Larry took the
eastern course of the street remembering in a flash a skiff he had seen
tethered to a scow moored to the pier which stretched like a pointer
finger from the little Square As yet he had no plan beyond the
necessity of the present moment which was flight Could he but make
that skiff unseen and cast off he would have time in the brief
sanctuary which the black river would afford him to formulate the
wisest procedure his predicament permitted him

As he came near that smothered glowworm of a streetlamp it assumed for
him the betraying glare of a huge spotlight But it had to be passed to
gain the skiff and with collar turned up and hatbrim pulled down and
head hunched low he entered the dim sphere of betrayal walked under
its pennysworth of flame and glided toward the shadows beyond his
eyes straining with the preternatural keenness of the hunted at every
stoop and doorway before him

He was just passing out of the sphere of mistlightthe lamp being now
at his back helped himwhen he saw three vague figures lurking half a
dozen paces ahead of him His brain registered these vague figures with
the instantaneity of a snapshot camera at full noon They were mere
shadows but the farther of the three seemed to be Barney Palmerhe
was not sure but of the identity of the other two there was no doubt
Little Mick and Lefty Ed both members high in the councils of
the Ginger Bucks and either of whose services as a killer could be
purchased for a hundred dollars or a paper of cocaine depending upon
which at the moment there was felt the greater need

In the very instant that he saw Larry doubled about and ran at full
speed back up the street Two shots rang out Larry could not
tell whether they were fired by Little Mick or Lefty Ed or Barney
Palmerthat is if the third man really were Barney Again two shots
were fired then came the sound of pursuing feet Luckily not one of the
bullets had touched Larry for the New York professional gunman is
the premier bad shot of all the world and cannot count upon his
marksmanship unless he can get his weapon solidly anchored against his
man or can sneak around to the rear and pot his unsuspecting victim in
the back

As Larry neared the pawnshop with the intention of making his escape
through the western stretch of the street he saw that Old Isaac has
switched on the lights and he also saw Officer Gavegan bearing down in
his direction They sighted each other in the same instant and Gavegan
let out a roar and started for him

Caught between two opposing forces Larry again had no time to plan
Rather there was nothing he could plan for only one way was open
to him He dashed into the pawnshop and into the back room At the
Duchesss desk Hunt was scribbling at furious speed


Im caught HuntGavegans coming he gasped and ran up the stairs
Hunt following and stuffing his scribblings into a pocket As Larry
passed the open studio door he saw Casey sitting up Down on the floor
with you Casey Hunt work over him to bring him toand stall Gavegan
for a while if you can

With that Larry sprang to a ladder at the end of the little hall ran
up it unhooked and pushed up the trap scrambled through upon the roof
and pushed the trap back into place

Fortune or rather the wellwishing wits of friends below gave Larry a
few precious moments more than he had counted on He was barely out
on the raingreased tin roof with the trap down when Gavegan came
thumping up the stairs and into the studio At sight of the recumbent
Casey head limply on Hunts knees and his loose face being laved by a
wet towel in Hunts hands Gavegan let out another roar

Hells bells What the hells this mean

I tried to nab Brainard Casey mumbled feebly and he knocked me out
coldthe same as he did you Gavegan

Hell snorted Gavegan his wrath increased by this reference You
thereto Hunt and the Duchesswhered Brainard go Hes in this
house some place

I dont know said Hunt

Yes you do Leave that boob sidekick of mine sleep it off and help
me find Brainard or youll feel my boot

The big painter stood up facing the big detective and his left hand
gripped the latters wrist and his right closed upon the detectives
throat just as it had closed upon the lean throat of Old Jimmie on the
day of Larrys returnonly now there was nothing playful in the noose
of that big hand He shook Gavegan as he might have shaken a pillow
with a thumb thrusting painfully in beneath Gavegans ear

Ive done nothing and that bully stuff doesnt go with me he
fairly spat into Gavegans face You talk to me like a gentleman and
apologize or Ill throw you out of the window and let your head bounce
off one of its brother cobblestones below

Gavegan choked out an apology whereat Hunt flung him from him The
detective glowering at the other pulled aside curtains peered into
corners then made furious and fruitless search of the rooms below
bringing up at last at Maggies door which the Duchess had slipped
ahead of him and locked When he demanded the key the Duchess told him
of Maggies departure and her carrying the key with her It was a
solid door with strong lock and hinges and two minutes of Gavegans
battering shoulders were required to make it yield entrance Not till he
found the room empty did Gavegan think of the trap and the roof

Larry made good use of these few extra minutes granted him Whatever
he was to do he realized he must do it quickly Not for long would the
forces arrayed against him be small in number Gavegan though beaten at
the outset would send out an alarm that would arouse the police of the
cityand in their own degree the gangsters would do the same During
his weeks of freedom Larry had unconsciously studied the layout of the
neighborhood his old instincts at work The subconscious knowledge thus
gained was of instant value He hurried along the slippery roofs taking
care not to trip over the dividing walls and came to the rear edge of
a roof where he had marked a fireescape with an unusually broad upper
landing He could discern the faint outlines of this and hanging to the
gutter he dropped to the fireescape and a moment later he was down
in the back yard and yet two moments later he was over two fences and
going through a rabbits burrow of a passageway that went beneath a
house into the street behind his own

He did not pause to reconnoiter Time was of the essence of his safety
risks had to be taken He plunged out of his holearound the first
corneraround the nextand thus wove in and out working westward
till at last on turning a corner into a lighted street he saw possible
relief in two stray taxicabs before a little East Side restaurant one
of which was just leaving

Taxi he called breathlessly

The chauffeur of the moving car swung back beside the curb and opened
the door But even as he started to enter he saw Little Mick and Lefty
Ed turn into the street behind him However the brightness of this
street illaccorded with the anonymity with which their art is most
safely and profitably practiced so Larry got in without a bullet
flicking at him

FortySecond Street and Broadway he called to the chauffeur as he
closed the door

The car started off Looking back through the little window he saw Lefty
Ed enter the other taxicab and saw Little Mick standing on the curb
He understood Little Mick was to send out the alarm while Lefty was to
follow the trail

Let Lefty follow At least Larry now had a few minutes to consider some
plan which should look beyond the safety of the immediate moment He
was welldressed albeit somewhat wet and soiled he had money in his
pockets What should he do

Yes what should he do The more he considered it the more ineluctable
did his situation become By now Gavegan had sent out his alarm within
a few moments every policeman on duty would have instructions to watch
for him He might escape for the time at least these allies of his
onetime pals by going to a hotel and taking a room there but to walk
into a hotel would be to walk into arrest On the other hand he might
evade the police if he sought refuge in one of his old haunts or
perhaps with old Bronson but then his angered pals knew of these
haunts and to enter one of them would be to offer himself freely to
their vengeance

There were other citiesbut then how was he to get to them He saw
Manhattan for what it was to a man who was a fugitive from justice and
injustice an island a trap with only a few outlets and inlets for
its millions two railway stationsa few ferriesa few bridgesa few
tunnels and at every one of them policemen watching for him He could
not leave New York And yet how in Gods name was he to stay here

He thought of Maggie So she wanted the life of dazzling excitement of
brilliant adventure did she He wondered how she would like a little of
the real thingsuch as this

As he neared FortySecond Street he still was without definite plan
which would guarantee him safety and there was Lefty hanging on
doggedly An idea came which would at least extend his respite and give
him more time for thought He opened the door of his cab and thrust a
tendollar note into the instinctively ready hand of his driver

Keep the changeand give me a swing once around Central Park slowing
down on those hilly turns on the west side

I gotcha

The car entered the park at the Plaza and sped up the shining almost
empty drive Larry kept watch now on the trailing Lefty now on the
best chance for execution of his ideaall the way up the east side and
around the turn at the north end As the car now southbound swung up
the hill near One Hundred and Fifth Street at whose crest there is
a sharp curve with thickgrowing overhanging trees Larry opened the
right door and said

Show me a little speed driver as soon as you pass this curve

I gotcha replied the chauffeur

The slowing car hugged the inside of the sharp turn Larry holding the
door open and waiting his moment The instant the taxi made the curve
Leftys car was cut from view and that instant Larry sprang from the
runningboard slamming the door behind him landed on soft earth and
scuttled in among the trees Crouching in the shadows he saw his car
speed away as per his orders and the moment after he saw Leftys car
evidently taken by surprise by this obvious attempt at escape leap
forward in hot pursuit

Larry slipped farther in among the trees and sat down his back against
a tree This was better For the time he was safe

He drew a long breath Then for a moment what he had just been through
this last hour came back to him in an almost amusing light as something
grotesquely impossiblemuch like those helterskelter utterly unreal
chases which with slight variations of personalities and costumes were
the chief plots for the motionpicture drama in its crude childhood But
though there seemed a likeness there was a tremendous difference For
this was real Every one was in earnest

Again he thought of Maggie What would she think what would be her
attitude if she knew the truth about himthe truth about those she
had gone with and the life she had gone into Would she be inclined
toward HIM would she help him

Again he thought of what he should do Now that he commanded a composure
which had not been his during the stress of his flight he examined
every aspect with greater care But the conclusions of composure were
the same as those of excitement He could not gain entrance to one
of the great hotels and remain in his room unidentified among its
thousands of strangers he could not find asylum in one of his old
haunts he dared not try to leave Manhattan He was a prisoner whose
only privilege was a larger but most uncertain liberty

And that liberty was becoming penetratingly uncomfortable An hour had
passed the ground on which he sat was wet and cold and the misty air
was assuming a distressing kinship with departed winter and was making
shivering assaults upon his bones At the best he realized he could
not hope to remain secure in this cultivated wilderness beyond daylight
With the coming of morning he would certainly be the prey of either his
pals or the police And if they did not beat him from his hiding plain
mortal hunger would drive him out into the open streets If he was to
do anything at all he must do it while he still had the moderate
protection of the night

And then for the first time there came to him remembrance of Hunts
rapid injunction given him in the hurlyburly of escape when no
thoughts could impress the upper surface of his mind save those of the
immediate moment If youre trapped call Plaza ninedoubleoone and
say Benvenuto Cellini

Larry had no idea what that swift instruction might be about And the
chance seemed a slender fantastical one even if he could safely get to
a public telephone But it seemed his only chance

He arose and keeping as much as he could to the wilder regions of the
park and making the utmost use of shadows when he had to cross a
path or a drive he stole southward He remembered a drugstore at
EightyFourth Street and Columbus Avenue peculiarly suited to his
purpose for it had a side entrance on EightyFourth Street and was in a
neighborhood where policemen were infrequent

Fortune favored him At length he reached EightyFourth Street and
peered over the wall Central Park West was practically empty of
automobiles for the theaters had not yet discharged their crowds and no
policeman was in sight He vaulted the wall a minute later he was in
a booth in the drugstore had dropped his nickel in the slot and was
asking for Plaza ninedoubleoone

Hello sir responded the very correct voice of a man

Benvenuto Cellini said Larry

Hold the wire sir said the voice

Larry held the wire wondering After a moment the same correct voice
asked where Larry was speaking from Larry gave the exact information

Stay right in the booth and keep on talking say anything you like
the wire here will be kept open continued the voice Well not keep
you waiting long sir

The voice ceased Larry began to chat about topics of the day about
invented friends and engagements well knowing that his stream of talk
was not being heard unless Central was listening in and knowing also
that to any one looking into the glass door of his booth he was giving
a most unsuspicious appearance of a busy man And while he talked his
wonder grew What was about to happen What was this Benvenuto Cellini
business all about

He had been talking for fifteen minutes or more when the glass door of
the booth was opened from without and a mans voice remarked

When you are through sir we will be going

The voice was the same he had heard over the wire Larry hung up and
followed the man out the side door noting only that he had a lean
respectful face At the curb stood a limousine the door of which was
opened by the man for Larry Larry stepped in

Are you followed sir inquired the man

I dont know

Wed better make certain If you are well lose them sir Well stop
somewhere and change our license plates again

Instead of getting into the unlighted body with him as Larry had
expected the man closed the door mounted to the seat beside the
chauffeur and the car shot west and turned up Riverside Drive

One may break the speed laws in New York if one has the speed and if
one has the ability to get away with it This car had both Never before
had Larry driven so rapidly within New York City limits he knew
this that any trailing taxicab would be lost behind At
TwoHundredandFortyFifth Street the car swung into Van Cortland Park
and switched off all lights Two minutes later they halted in a dark
stretch of one of the byroads of the Park

Well be stopping only a minute sir to put on our right number
plates the man opened the door to explain

Within the minute they were away again now proceeding more
leisurely in the easy manner of a private car going about its private
businessthough the interior of the car was discreetly dark and
Larry huddled discreetly into a corner Thus they drove over the Grand
Boulevards and recrossed the Harlem River and presently drew up in front
of a great apartment house in Park Avenue

The man opened the door Walk right in sir as though you belong here
The doorman and the elevatorman are prepared

They might be prepared but Larry certainly was not and he shot up the
elevator to the top floor with mounting bewilderment The man unlocked
the door of an apartment ushered Larry in took his wet hat then
ushered the dazed Larry through the corner of a dimlit drawingroom and
through another door

You are to wait here sir said the man and quietly withdrew

Larry looked about him He took in but a few details but he knew enough
about the better fittings of life to realize that he was in the presence
of both money and the best of taste He noted the log fire in the broad
fireplace comfortable chairs the imported rugs on the gleaming floor
the shelves of books which climbed to the ceiling a quaint writingdesk
in one corner which seemed to belong to another country and another
century but which was perfectly at home in this room

On the desk he saw standing a leatherframed photograph which seemed
familiar He crossed and picked it up Indeed it was familiar It was
a photograph of Hunt of Hunt not in the shabby shapeless garments
he wore down at the Duchesss but Hunt accoutered as might be a man
accustomed to such a room as thisthough in this picture there was the
same strong chin the same belligerent goodnatured eyes

Now how and where did that impecunious roughneck painter fit into

But the dazed question Larry was asking was interrupted by a voice from
the doorthe thick voice of a man

Who the hell r you

Larry whirled about In the doorway stood a tall bellicose young
gentleman of perhaps twentyfour or five in evening dress flushed of
face holding unsteadily to the doorjamb

I beg your pardon said Larry

N what the hell you doin here continued the belligerent young
gentleman

Id be obliged to you if you could tell me said Larry

Tryin to stall r you declared the young gentleman with a scowling
profundity No go Got to come out your corner n fight N Im goin
lick you

The young man crossed unsteadily to Larry and took a fighting pose

Put em up he ordered

This was certainly a night of strange adventure thought Larry His wild
escapehis coming to this unknown placeand now this befuddled young
fellow intent upon battle with him

Lets fight tomorrow Larry suggested soothingly

Put em up ordered the other If you dont know what youre doin
here Ill show you what youre doin here

But he was not to show Larry for while he was uttering his last words
trying to steady himself in a crouch for the delivery of a blow a voice
sounded sharply from the doorwaya womans voice

Dick

The young man slowly turned But Larry had seen her first He had no
chance to take her in that first moment beyond noting that she was
slender and young and exquisitely gowned for she swept straight across
to them

Dick youre drunk again she exclaimed

Wrong sis he corrected in an injured tone Its same drunk

Dick you go to bed

Now sis

You go to bed

The young man wavered before her commanding gaze Juss you sayjuss
you say he mumbled and went unsteadily toward the door

The young woman watched him out and then turned her troubled face back
to Larry Im sorry Dick behaved to you as he did

And then before Larry could make answer her clouded look was gone So
youre here at last Mr Brainard She held her hand out smiling
a smile that by some magic seemed to envelop him within an immediate
friendship

Im Miss Sherwood He noted that the slender tapering hand had almost
a mans strength of grip You neednt tell me anything about yourself
she added for I already know a lotall I need to know about youand
about Maggie Carlisle You see an hour ago a messenger brought me a long
letter hed written about you And she nodded to the photograph Larry
was still holding

Youyou know him Larry stammered

She answered with a whimsical smile Yes Isnt he a grand foolish
old dear Hes such a roistering bragging personage that Ive named him
Benvenuto Cellinithough hes neither liar nor thief He must have told
you what I called him

So that explained this password of Benvenuto Cellini No he didnt
explain anything There was no time

I dont know where he is she continued please dont tell me I
dont want to know until he wants me to know

Larry had been making a swift appraisal of her She was perhaps thirty
fair with goldenbrown hair held in place by a large comb of wrought
gold with violetblue eyes wearing a lowcut gown of violet chiffon
velvet and dull gold shoes Larrys instinct told him that here was a
patrician a thoroughbred with poise with a knowledge of the world
with whimsical humor with a kindly understanding of people with steel
in her and with a smiling readiness for almost any situation

I think no one will find youat least for the present her pleasantly
modulated voice continued There are so many things I want to talk
over with you Perhaps I can help about Maggie I hope you dont mind
my talking about her Larry could not imagine any one taking offense
at anything this brilliant apparition might possibly say But well put
off our talk until tomorrow Its late and youre wet and cold and
besides my aunt is having one of her bad spells and thinks she needs
me Judkins will see to you Goodnight

Goodnight said Larry

She moved gracefully outalmost floated Larry would have said The
next moment the man was with him who had been his escort here and led
Larry into a spacious bedroom with bath attached Ten minutes later
Judkins made his exit carrying Larrys outer clothes and another
ten minutes later after a hot bath and garbed in silk pajamas which
Judkins had produced Larry was in the softest and freshest bed that had
ever held him

But sleep did not come to Larry for a long time He lay wondering about
this goldenhaired poiseful Miss Sherwood She was undoubtedly the
woman in the back of Hunts life And he wondered about Huntwho he
really waswhat had really driven him into this strange exile And he
wondered about Maggiewhat she might be doingwhat from this strange
new vantagepoint he might do for her and with her And he wondered how
his own complex situation was going to work itself out

And still wondering Larry at length fell asleep




CHAPTER XII


When Larry awoke the next morning he blinked for several bewildered
moments about his bedroom so unlike his cell at Sing Sing and so unlike
Hunts helterskelter studio down at the Duchesss which he had shared
before he realized that this big airy chamber and this miracle of a bed
on which he lay were realities and not a mere continuation of a dream of
fantastic and bodyflattering wealth

Then his mind turned back a page in the book of his life and he lay
considering the events of the previous evening the scene with Barney
and Old Jimmie and Maggie their all denouncing him as a police
stoolpigeon and a squealer and Maggies defiant departure to begin her
longdreamedof career as a leadingwoman and perhaps star in what she
saw as great and thrilling adventures his own enforced and frenzied
flight his strange method of reaching this splendid apartment his
meeting with the handsome drinkbefuddled young man in evening clothes
his meeting with the exquisitely gowned patrician Miss Sherwood who
had received him with the poise and frank friendliness of a democratic
queen and had immediately ordered him off to bed

Strange all of these things But they were all realities And in this
new set of circumstances which had come into being in a night what was
he to do

He recalled that Miss Sherwood had said that she and he would have their
talk that morning He pulled his watch from under his pillow It was
past nine oclock He looked about him for clothes but saw only a
bathrobe Then he remembered Judkins carrying off his rainsoaked
garments with Ring for me when you wake up sir

Larry found an electric bell button dangling over the top of his bed by
a silken cord He pushed the button and waited Within two minutes the
door opened and Judkins entered laden with fresh garments

Goodmorning sir said Judkins Your own clothes and some shirts
and other things Ive borrowed from Mr Dick How will you have your
bath sirhot or cold

Cold said the bewildered Larry

Judkins disappeared into the great whitetiled bathroom there was the
rush of splashing water for a few moments then silence and Judkins
reappeared

Your bath is ready sir Ive laid out some of Mr Dicks razors How
soon shall I bring you in your breakfast

In about twenty minutes said Larry

Exactly twenty minutes later Judkins carried in a tray and set it on
a table beside a window looking down into Park Avenue Miss Sherwood
asked me to tell you she would see you in the library at ten oclock
sirwhere she saw you last night said Judkins and noiselessly was
gone

Freshly shaven tingling from his bath with a sense of being garbed
flawlessly though in garments partly alien Larry addressed himself
to the breakfast of grapefruit omelette toast and coffee served on
Sevres china with covers of old silver In his more prosperous eras
Larry had enjoyed the best private service that the best hotels in New
York had to sell but their best had been coarse and slovenly compared
to this He would eat for a minute or twothen get up and look at his
carefully dressed self in the fulllength mirrorthen gaze from his
high exclusive window down into Park Avenue with its stream of cars
comfortably carrying their occupants toward ten oclock jobs in Wall
or Broad Streetsand then he would return to his breakfast This was
amazingbewildering

He was toward the end of his omelette when a knock sounded at his door
Thinking Judkins had returned he called Come in but instead of
Judkins the opening door admitted the belligerent young man in rumpled
evening clothes of the previous night Now he wore a silk dressinggown
of a flamboyant peacock blue his feet showed bare in toe slippers his
wavy yellowish hair had the tousled effect of a very recent separation
from a pillow A cigarette depended from the corner of his mouth

Larry started to rise But the young man arrested the motion with a
gesture of mock imperativeness

Keep your seat fair sir I would fain have speech with thee He
crossed and sat on a corner of Larrys table one slippered foot
dangling and looked Larry over with an appraising eye Permit me to
remark sir he continued in his grand manner that you look as though
you might be some one

Is that what you wanted to tell me Mr Sherwood queried Larry

The others grand manner vanished and he grinned Forget the Mr
Sherwood or youll make me feel not at home in my own house he
begged with humorous mournfulness Call me Dick Everybody else does
Thats settled Now to the reason for this visitation at such an ungodly
hour Sis has just been in picking on me Says I was rude to you last
night I suppose I was Id had several from my private stock early in
the evening and several more around in jovial Manhattan joints where
prohibition hasnt checked the flow of happiness if you know the
countersign The cumulative effect you saw and were the victim of I
apologize sir

Thats all right Mr

Dick is what I said interrupted the other

Dick then Its all right I understand

Thanks Ill call you Old Captain Nemo for short Sis didnt tell
me your name or anything about you and she said I wasnt to ask you
questions But whatever Isabel does is usually one hundred percent
right She said Id probably be seeing a lot of you so Ill introduce
myself Youd learn all about me from some one else anyhow so you
might as well learn about me from me and get an impartial and unbiased
statement Clever of me aint it to beat em to it

Larry found himself smiling back into the ingratiating irresponsible
boyish face I suppose so

Ill shoot you the whole works at once Name Richard Livingston
Sherwood Years twentyfour but alleged not yet to have reached the
age of discretion One of our young flying heroes who helped save France
and make the world safe for something or other by flapping his wings
over the endless alkali of Texas Occupation gentleman farmer

You a farmer exclaimed Larry

A gentleman farmer corrected Dick The difference between a farmer
and a gentleman farmer Captain Nemo is that a gentleman farmer makes
no profit on his crops Now my friends say Im losing an awful lot of
money and am sowing an awfully big crop And according to them instead
of practicing sensible crop rotation Im a foolish onecrop farmerand
my one crop is wild oats

I see said Larry

Of course I do do a little something else on the side Avocation Im
in the brokerage business But my chief business is looking after the
Sherwood interests You see my motherfather died ten years before she
didmy mother being dotty about the innate superiority of the male
left me in control of practically everything and I do as well by it as
the more important occupation of farming will permit Which completes
the racy history of myself

Im sorry I cant reciprocate

Thats all right Captain Nemo Theres plenty of timeand it doesnt
make any difference anyhow For all his light manner and careless
chatter Larry had a sense that Dick had been sizing him up all this
while that in fact to do this was the real purpose of the present
call Dick slipped to his feet If youre just now a bit shy on duds
as I understand you are why were about the same size Tell Judkins
what you want and make him give you plenty What time you got

Just ten oclock

By hecktime a farmer was pulling on his overalls and going forth to
his dewgemmed toil

And time for me to be seeing your sister said Larry rising

Come on Im a good seneschal or major domo or what you likeand
Ill usher you into her highnesss presence

A moment later Larry was pushed through the library door and Dick
announced in solemn tone

SenoritaMademoiselleour serene revered and most high sister
Isabel permit us to present our newest and most charming friend
Captain Nemo

Dick exclaimed Miss Sherwood get out of here and get yourself into
some clothes

Listen to that complained Dick She still talks to me as though I
were her small brother Next thing shell be ordering me to wash behind
my ears

Get out and shut the door after you

The reply was Dicks stately exit and the sharp closing of the door

Has Dick been talking to you about himself asked Miss Sherwood

Yes

What did he say

Larry gave the substance of the autobiography which Dick had
volunteered

Part of that is more than the truth part less than the truth Miss
Sherwood remarked But this morning we were to have a real talk about
your affairs and lets get to the subject

She had motioned him to a chair beside the quaint old desk and they
were now sitting face to face Isabel Sherwood looked as much the
finished patrician as on the evening before and with that easy
whimsical humor and the direct manner of the person who is sure of
herself and in the sober disillusioning daylight she had no less
of beauty than had seemed hers in the softer lighting of their first
meeting The clear fresh face with its violetblue eyes was gazing at
him intently Larry realized that she was looking into the very soul of
him and he sat silent during this estimate which he recognized she had
the right to make

Mr Hunt has written me the main facts about you certainly the worst
she said finally You need tell me nothing further if you prefer not
to do so but it might be helpful if I knew more of the details

Larry felt that there was no information he was not willing to give this
cleareyed charming woman and so he told her all that had happened
since his return from Sing Sing including his falling in love with
Maggie the nature of their conflict her departure into the ways of her
ambition

You are certainly facing a lot of difficult propositions Miss
Sherwood checked them off on her fingers The police are after
youyour old friends are after youyou do not dare be caught You
want to clear yourselfyou want to make a business successyou want
to eradicate Maggies present ambitions and remove her from her present
influences

That is the correct total said Larry

Certainly a large total Of them all which is the most important
item

Larry considered Maggie he confessed But Maggie really includes
all the others To have any influence with her I must get out of the
power of the police I must overcome her belief that I am a stool and
a squealer and I must prove to her that I can make a success by going
straight

Just so And all these things you must do while a fugitive in hiding

Exactly Or else not do them

Hm The most pressing thing I judge is to have a safe and
permanent place to hide and to have work which may lead to an
opportunity to prove yourself a success

Yes

Mr Hunts OK on you would be sufficient in any event and he has
given that OK Miss Sherwood said in her even voice Besides my own
judgment prompts me to believe in your truth and your sincerity I have
been thinking the matter over since I saw you last night I therefore
ask you to remain here never leaving the apartment

Miss Sherwood he ejaculated

And a little later when we go out to our place on Long Island youll
have more freedom For the present you will be to the servants and any
other persons who may chance to come in Mr Brandon a second cousin
staying with us and your explanation for never venturing forth can be
that you are convalescing after an operation Perhaps you can think of a
plan whereby later on you might occasionally leave the house without too
great risk to yourself

Yes The risk comes from the police and from some of my old friends
and the gangsters they have enlisted So long as they believe me in
New York theyll all be on the lookout for me every moment If they
believed me out of New York they would all discontinue their vigilance
IfifBut perhaps you would not care to do so much

Go on

Would you be willing to write a letter to some friend in Chicago
requesting the friend to post an enclosed letter written by me

Certainly

My handwriting would be disguisedbut a person who really knows my
writing would penetrate the attempted disguise and recognize it as mine
My letter would be addressed to my grandmother requesting her to express
my recent purchase of forfeited pledges to me in Chicago A clever
person reading the letter would be certain I was asking her to send me
my clothes

Whats the point to that

One detail of the polices search for me will be to open secretly with
the aid of the postal authorities all mail addressed to my grandmother
They will steam open this letter about my clothes then seal it and let
it be delivered But they will have learned that I have escaped them and
am in Chicago They will drop the hunt here and telegraph the Chicago
police And of course the news will leak through to my old friends and
theyll also stop looking for me in New York

I see

And enclosed in another letter written by you Ill send an order also
to be posted in Chicago to a good friend of mine asking him to call at
the express office get my clothes and hold them until I call or send
for them When he goes and asks for the clothes the Chicago police will
get him and find the order on him Theyll have no charge at all against
him but theyll have further proof that Im in Chicago or some place
in the Middle West The effect will be definitely to transfer the search
from New York

Yes I see repeated Miss Sherwood Go ahead and do it Ill
help you But for the present youve got to remain right here in the
apartment as I said And later when you think the letters have had
their effect you must use the utmost caution

Certainly agreed Larry

Now as to your making a start in business I suspect that my affairs
are in a very bad shape Things were left to my brother as he told you
I have a lot of papers all kinds of accounts which he has brought to
me and hes bringing me a great many more I cant make head or tail
of them and I think my brother is about as much befuddled as I am I
believe only an expert can understand them Mr Hunt says you have
a very keen mind for such matters I wish youd take charge of these
papers and try to straighten them out

Miss Sherwood Larry said slowly you know my record and yet you risk
trusting me with your affairs

Not that I wouldnt take the riskbut whatever there is to steal some
one else has already stolen it or will steal it Your work will be to
discover thefts or mistakes and to prevent thefts or mistakes if you
can You see I am not placing any actual control over stealable property
in younot yet Well what do you say

I can only say Miss Sherwood that you are more than good and that I
am more than grateful and that I shall do my best

Miss Sherwood regarded him thoughtfully for a long space Then she said
I am going to place something further in your hands for if you are as
clever as I think you are and if life has taught you as much as I think
it has I believe you can help me a lot My brother Dick is wild and
reckless I wish youd look out for him and try to hold him in check
where you can That is if this isnt placing too great a duty on you

Thats not a dutyits a compliment

Then that will be all for the present Ill see you again in an hour or
two when I shall have some things ready to turn over to you

Back in his bedroom Larry walked exultantly to and fro He had security
And at last he had a chanceperhaps the chance he had been yearning for
through which he was ultimately to prove himself a success

He wondered yet more about Miss Sherwood And again about her and Hunt
Miss Sherwood was clever gracious everything a man could want in a
woman and he guessed that behind her humorous references to Hunt there
was a deep feeling for the big painter who was living almost like a
tramp in the attic of the Duchesss little house And Larry knew Miss
Sherwood was the only woman in Hunts life Hunt had said as much They
were everything to each other they trusted each other Yet there was
some wide breach between the two evidently his own crisis had forced
the only communication which had passed between the two for months He
wondered what that breach could be and what had been its cause

And then an idea began to open its possibilities What a splendid
return if somehow he could do something that would help bring
together these two persons who had befriended him

But most of the time while he waited for Miss Sherwood to summon him
again he wondered about Maggie Yes as he had told Miss Sherwood
Maggie was the most important problem of his life all his many other
problems were important only in the degree that they aided or hindered
the solution of Maggie Where was shewhat was she doinghow was he
in this pleasant prison which he dared not leave ever to overcome her
scorn of him and ever to divert her from that dangerous career in which
her proud and excited young vision saw only the brilliant and profitable
adventure of high romance




CHAPTER XIII


When Maggie rode away forever from the house of the Duchess with Barney
Palmer and her father after the denunciation of Larry by the three of
them as a stool and a squealer she was the thrilled container of about
as many diversified emotions as often bubble and swirl in a young girl
at one and the same time There was anger and contempt toward Larry
Larry who had weakly thrown aside a career in which he was a master and
who had added to that bad the worse of being a traitor There was the
lifting sense that at last she had graduated that at last she was set
free from the drab and petty things of life that at last she was riding
forth into the great brilliant world in which everything happenedforth
into the fascinating bewildering Unknown

Barney and Old Jimmie talked to each other as the taxicab bumped through
the cobbled streets their talk being for the most part maledictions
against Larry Brainard But their words were meaningless sounds to the
silent Maggie all of whose throbbing faculties were just then merged
into an excited endeavor to perceive the glorious outlines of the
destiny toward which she rode However as the cab turned into Lafayette
Place and rolled northward her curiosity about the unknown became
conscious and articulate

Where am I going she asked

First of all to a nice quiet hotel It was Barney who answered
somehow Barney had naturally moved into the position of leader and as
naturally her father had receded to second place Weve got everything
fixed Maggie Rooms reserved and a companion waiting there for you

A companion exclaimed Maggie What for

To teach you the fine points of manners and to help you buy clothes
Shes a classy bird all right I advertised and picked her out of a
dozen who applied

Barney breathed Maggie She was silent a dazed moment then asked
Justjust what am I going to do

Listen Maggie Ill spill you the whole idea Id have told you
before but its developed rather sudden and Ive not had a real
chance and besides I knew youd be all for it Jimmie and I have
canned that stockselling scheme for goodunless an easy chance for it
develops later Our big idea now is to put YOU across Barney believed
that there might still remain in Maggie some lurking admiration
for Larry some influence of Larry over her and to eradicate these
completely by the brilliance of what he offered was the chief purpose of
his further quickspoken words To put you across in the biggest kind
of a way Maggie A beautiful clever woman who knows how to use her
brains and who has brainy handling can bring in more money and in a
safer way than any dozen men And I tell you Maggie Ill make you a
star

Barney But you havent told me just what Im to do

The first thing will be just a tryout itll help finish your
education Ive got it doped out but Ill not tell you till later The
main idea is not to use you in just one game Maggie but to finish you
off so youll fit into dozens of gamesbe good year after year A big
actress who can step right into any big part that comes her way Thats
what pays I tell you Maggie theres no other such good steady
proposition on earth as the right kind of woman And thats what youre
going to be

Maggie had heard much this same talk often before Then it had been
vague and had dealt with an indefinite future Now she was too dazzled
by this picture of near events which the eager Barney was drawing to be
able to make any comment

Ill be right behind you in everything and so will Jimmie Barney
continued in his exciting mannerbut youll be the party out in front
who really puts the proposition over And well keep to things where the
police cant touch us Get a man with coin and position tangled up right
in a deal with a woman and hell never let out a peep and hell come
across with oodles of money Hundreds of ways of working that A strong
point about you Maggie is you have no police record Neither have I
though the police suspect mebut as I said Ill keep off the stage
as much as I can I tell you Maggie were going to put over some great
stuff Great I tell you

Maggie felt no repugnance to what had been said and implied by Barney
How could she when since her memory began she had lived among people
who talked just these same things To Maggie they seemed the natural
order At that moment she was more concerned by a fascinating necessity
which Barneys flamboyant enterprise entailed

But to do anything like that wont I need clothes

Youll need em and youll have em Youre going to have one of
the swellest outfits that ever happened Youll make Paris ashamed of
itself

No use blowing the whole roll on Maggies clothes put in Old Jimmie
speaking for the first time

Barney turned on him caustically almost savagely Youre a hell of a
father you arecounting the pennies on his own daughter I told you
this was no pikers game and you agreed to itso cut out the idea
youre in any nickelintheslot business

Old Jimmie felt physical pain at the thought of parting from money on
such a scale His earlier plans concerning Maggie had never contemplated
any such extravagance But he was silenced by the dominant force behind
Barneys sarcasm

Miss Griersonshes your companionknows whats what about clothes
continued Barney to Maggie Heres the dope as Ive handed it to her
Youre an orphan from the West with some dough whos come to New York
as my ward and Jimmies and we want you to learn a few things To her
and to any new people we meet Im your cousin and Jimmie is your uncle
Youve got that all straight

Yes said Maggie

Youre to use another name Ive picked out Margaret Cameron for you
We can call you Maggie and it wont be a slipupsee If any of the
coppers who know you should tumble on to you just tell em you dropped
your own name sos to get clear of your old life They cant do anything
to you And tell em you inherited a little coin thats why youre
living so swell They cant do anything about that either  Heres
where we get out Got a sittingroom two bedrooms and a bath hired for
you here But well soon move you into a classier hotel

The taxi had stopped in front of one of the unpretentious respectable
hotels in the Thirties just off Fifth Avenue and Maggie followed the
two men in This hotel did indeed in its people its furnishings its
atmosphere seem sober and commonplace after the Ritzmore but at the
Ritzmore she had been merely a cigarettegirl a paid onlooker at the
gayety of others Here she was a real guesthere her great life was
beginning Maggies heart beat wildly

Up in her sittingroom Barney introduced her to Miss Grierson then
departed with a significant look at Old Jimmie saying he would return
presently and leaving Old Jimmie behind Old Jimmie withdrew into a
corner turned to the racing part of the Evening Telegram which
with the corresponding section of the Morning Telegraph was his sole
reading and left Maggie to the society of Miss Grierson

Maggie studied this strange new being her hired companion with
furtive keenness and after a few minutes though she was shyly obedient
in the manner of an untutored orphan from the West she had no fear of
the other Miss Grierson was a large flatbacked woman who was on the
descending slope of middle age She was really a gentlewoman in
the selfpitying and selfpraising sense in which those who advertise
themselves as such use that word She was all the social forms all
the proprieties She was deferentially autocratic her voice was
monotonously dignified and cultured and she was tired which she had a
right to be for she had been in this business of being a gentlewomanly
hired aunt to raw young girls for over a quarter of a Century

To the tired but practical eye of Miss Grierson here was certainly a
young woman who needed a lot of working over to make into a lady
And though weary and unthrillable as an old horse Miss Grierson was
conscientious and she was going to do her best

Maggie made a swift survey of her new home The rooms were just ordinary
hotel rooms furnished with the dingy wholesale pretentiousness of
hotels of the second rate But they were the essence of luxury compared
to her one room at the Duchesss with its view of dreary back yards
These rooms thrilled her They were her first material evidence that she
was now actually launched upon her great adventure

Maggie had dinner in her sittingroom with Old Jimmie and Miss
Griersonand of that dinner mediocre and sloppy and chilled by its
transit of twelve stories from the kitchen Miss Grierson by way of an
introductory lesson made an august function almost diagrammatic in
its educational details After the dinner with Miss Griersons slow and
formal aid which consisted mainly in passages impressively declaimed
from her private book of decorum Maggie spent two hours in unpacking
her suitcase and trunk and repacking her scanty wardrobe in drawers of
the chiffonier and dressingtable a task which Maggie left to herself
could have completed in ten minutes

Maggie was still at this task in her bedroom when she heard Barney enter
her sittingroom He got away she heard him say in a low voice to Old
Jimmie

She slipped quickly out of her bedroom and closed the door behind her
An undefined something had suddenly begun to throb within her

Who got away Barney she demanded in a hushed tone

Her look made Barney think rapidly He was good at quick thinking was
Barney He decided to tell the truthor part of it

Larry Brainard

Got away from what she pursued

The police They were after him on some charge And some of his pals
were after him too They were out to get him because he had squealed on
Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt Both parties were closing in on him
at about the same time But Larry got a tip somehow and made his
getaway

When did it happen

Must have happened a little time after we all left the Duchesss

Butbut Barneyhow did you learn it so soon

Just ran into Officer Gavegan over on Broadway and he told me lied
Barney He preferred not to tell her that he had been upon the scene
with Little Mick and Lefty Ed for the third figure which Larry had
descried through the misty shadows had indeed been Barney Palmer Also
Barney preferred not to tell what further subtle share he had had in the
causes for Larrys flight

Do you think hehe made a safe getaway

Safe for a few hours Gavegan told me theyd have him rounded up by
noon tomorrow Barney was more conscious of Maggies interest than was
Maggie herself and again was desirous of destroying it or diverting it
Generally Im for the other fellow against the police But this time
Im all for the coppers I hope they land Larryhes got it coming to
him Remember that hes a stool and a squealer

And swiftly Barney switched the subject Lets be moving along
Jimmie

He drew Maggie out into the hall to make more certain that Miss
Grierson would not overhear Well Maggie he exulted havent I made
good so far in my bargain to put you over

Yes

Of course were going slow at first Thats how youve got to
handle big dealscareful But youll sure be a knockout when that
sheundertaker in there gets you rigged out in classy clothes Then
the curtain will go up on the real showand its going to be a big
showand youll be the hit of the piece

With that incitement to Maggies imagination Barney left her and Old
Jimmie followed furtively giving Maggie a brief uncertain look




CHAPTER XIV


A block away from the hotel Barney parted from Old Jimmie For a space
Barney thought of his partner Barney had quick eyes which were quite
capable of taking in two things at once and while he had seen the
excited glow his final speech had brought back into Maggies face he
had also caught that swift look of uncertainty in the lean cunning face
of Old Jimmie a look of one who is eager to go on yet sees himself
frustrated by his own eagerness To Barney it was a puzzling suspicious
look

As Barney made his way toward a harbor of refreshment he wondered about
Old Jimmienot in the manner Larry had wondered about a father bringing
his daughter up into crooked waysbut he wondered what kind of a man
beneath his shrewd yielding placating manner Old Jimmie really was
how far he was to be trusted whether he was in this game on the level
or whether he was playing some very secret hand of his own Though he
had known and worked with Old Jimmie for years Barney had never been
admitted to the inner chambers of the older mans character He sensed
that there were hidden rooms and twisting passages and of this much he
was certain that Old Jimmie was sly and saturnine

Well he would be on guard that Old Jimmie didnt put anything over on
your obliging servant Barney Palmer

This was the era of legal prohibition but thus far Barney had not been
severely discommoded by the action of the representatives of Americas
free institutions in Washington for Barney knew his New York In an
exsaloon on Sixth Avenue which nominally sold only the soft drinks
permitted by the wise men of the Capital Barney leaned at his ease upon
the bar and remarked Give me some of the real stuff Tim and forget
that eyedropper the boss bought you last week Barney had a drink of
the real stuff and then another drink in the measuring of neither of
which had an eyedropper been involved

After that much heartened he put two dollars upon the bar and went
his way His course took the dapper Barney into three of the gayest
restaurants in the Times Square section and in these Barney paused long
enough to speak to a few aftertheater supperparties For this was the
hour when Barney paid his social calls he was very strict with himself
upon this point Barney was really by way of being a rising figure in
this particular circle of New York society composed of people who had
or believed they had an interest in the theater of expensively gowned
women the foreground of whose lives was most attractive but whose
background was perhaps wisely kept out of the picture and of moneyed
young men who gloried in the idea that they were living the life These
social calls from gay table to gay table at all of which Barney was
welcomefor here Barney showed only his most attractive surfaces his
most brilliant facetswere in truth a very important part of Barneys
business

A little later alone at a corner table in a quieter restaurant Barney
was eating his supper and making an inventory of his prospects He was
in a very exultant mood The whiskey he had drunk had given broad
wings to his selfsatisfaction and what he was now sipping from his
teacupit was not tea for Barney was on the proper terms with his
waiter herethis draught from his teacup tipped these broad wings at a
yet more soaring angle

Yes he had certainly put it over so far And Maggie would certainly
prove a winner Those fair women he had chatted with as he had moved
from table to table why theyd be less than dirt compared to Maggie
when Maggie was rigged out and readied up and the stage was set And it
had been he Barney Palmer who had been the first to discover Maggies
latent possibilities

He had an eye beyond mere surfaces had Barney He had used women in the
past in putting over many of his more private transactions and had done
so partly for the reason that using women so was eminently safethis
despite his violent outburst of sneering disdain at Larry when the
latter had spoken of safety some of them professional sharpers some
unscrupulous actresses of the lower flightsuch women as he had just
chatted with in the restaurants where he had made his brief visits But
such he now recognized were rather BLASEES rather too obvious They
were the blown rose But Maggie was fresh and once she was properly
broken in she would be his perfect instrument Yes perfect

Barneys plans soared on Some day when it fitted in just right with
his plans he was going to marry Maggie It was only recently that he
had seen her full charms and still more recently that he had determined
upon marriage That decision had materially altered certain details of
the career Barney had blueprinted for himself Barney had long regarded
marriage as an asset for himself a valuable resource which he must hold
in reserve and not liquidate or capitalize until his own market was at
its peak He knew that he was goodlooking an excellent dancer that he
had the metropolitan finish He had calculated that sometime some rich
girl perhaps from the West who did not know the world too well would
fall under the spell of his charms and he would marry her promptly
while she was still infatuated before she could learn too much about
him Such had been Barneys idea of marriage for himself which is very
similar to ideas held by thousands of gentlemen young and otherwise
in this broad land of ours who consider themselves neither lawbreakers
nor adventurers

But that was all changed now Now it was Maggie though Maggie in
pursuit of their joint advantage might possibly first have to go through
the marriage ceremony with some other man Of course a very very rich
man Barney already had this man marked He hoped though they would
not have to go so far as marriage However he was willing to wait his
proper turn As he had told Maggie you could not put over a big thing
in a hurry

As for Larry hed certainly handled that business in swell fashion
Hed certainly put a crimp in what had been developing between Larry and
Maggie And hed get Larry in time too The dragnet was too large and
close of mesh for Larry to hope to escape it The word hed slipped that
boob Gavegan had sure done the business And the indirect way he had
tipped off the police about Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt and had
then made his pals think Larry had squealedthat was sure playing the
game too Jack and Red would get off easythere was nothing on them
but little old Barney Palmer had certainly used his bean in the way
he had set the machinery of the police and the underworld in motion
against Larry

While other occupants of the cafe particularly the women stole looks
at the handsome flawlessly dressed interestinglooking Barney Barney
had yet another of those concoctions which the discreet waiter served in
a teacup Hed done a great little job you bet Not another man in New
York could have done better He was sure going to put Maggie across And
in doing so he was going to do what was right by yours truly

All seemed perfect in Barneys world

And while Barney sat exulting over triumphs already achieved and those
inevitably to be achieved Maggie lay in her new bed dreaming exultant
dreams of her own heedless of the regular snoring which resounded in
the adjoining roomfor the excellent Miss Grierson while able to
keep her every act in perfect form while in the conscious state
unfortunately when unconscious had no more control of the goingson of
her mortal functions than the lowliest washwoman Maggies flights
of fancy circled round and round Larry She stifled any excuses or
insurgent yearnings for him Hed deserved what he had got Already
contrary to his predictions she had made a tremendous advance into her
brilliant future She would show him Yes she would show him Oh but
she was going to do things

But while she dreamed thus shaping a magnificent destinyan
independent selfengineered young woman so very very confident of the
great future she was going to achieve through the supremacy of her own
will and her own abilitiesno slightest surmise came into her mind that
Barney Palmer was making plans by which her will was to count as naught
and by which he was to be the master of her fate and that the furtive
yielding Old Jimmie was also dreaming a patient dream in which she was
to be a mere chesspiece which was to capture a longcherished game

And yet after all Maggies dreams aside from the peculiar twist life
had given them were fundamentally just the ordinary dreams of youth of
willful confident youth to whom but a small part of the world has yet
been opened who in fact does not yet half know its own nature




CHAPTER XV


No prison could have been more agreeablethat is no prison from which
Maggie was omittedthan this in which Larry was now confined He had
the run of the apartment Dick Sherwood outfitted him liberally with
clothing from his superabundance of the best Judkins and the other
servants treated him as the member of the family which they had been
informed he was the lively Dick with his puppylike friendliness
asked never an uncomfortable question and placed Larry almost on the
footing of a chum and the whimsically smiling Miss Sherwood treated
Larry exactly as she might have treated any wellbred gentleman and in
every detail made good on her promise to give him a chance In fact in
all his life Larry had never lived so well

As for Miss Sherwoods aunt a sister of Miss Sherwoods mother and a
figure of pale absentminded dignity she kept very much to her own
sittingroom She was a recent convert to the younger English novelists
and was forced to her seclusion by the amazing fecundity with which they
kept repopulating her readingtable Larry she accepted with a hazy
preoccupied politeness eager always to get back to the more substantial
characters of her latest fiction

Of course Miss Sherwood did not make of Larry a complete confidant For
all her smiling easy frankness he knew that there were many doors
of her being which she never unlocked for him What he saw was so
interesting that he could not help being interested about the rest Of
course many details were open to him She was an excellent sportswoman
a rare dancer there were many men interested in her she dined out
almost every other evening at some social affair blooming belatedly in
May most of her friends were already settled in their country homes
and she was still in town only because her place on Long Island was in
disorder due to a two months delay in the completion of alterations
caused by labor difficulties she had made a study of beetles she had
a tiny vivarium in the apartment and here she would sit studying her
pets with an interest and patience not unlike that of old Fabre upon his
stony farm Also as Larry learned from her accounts there was a day
nursery on the East Side whose lack of a deficit was due to her

All in all she was a healthy normal intelligent unselfsacrificing
woman who belonged distinctly to her own day who gave a great deal to
life and who took a great deal from life

Often Larry wished she would speak of Hunt He was curious about Hunt
of whom he thought daily and such talk might yield him information
about the blustering bighearted painter who was gypsying it down at
the Duchesss But as the days passed she never mentioned Hunt again
not even to ask where he was or what he was doing She was adhering very
strictly to the remark she had made the night Larry came here I dont
want to know until he wants me to know And so Hunt remained the same
incomplete picture to Larry the painter was indubitably at home in such
surroundings as these and he was at home as a roistering hardworking
vagabond at the Duchesssbut all the vast spaces between were utterly
blank except for the sketchy remarks Hunt had made concerning himself

Larry had guessed that hurt pride was the reason for Hunts vanishment
from the world which had known him But he knew hurt pride was not Miss
Sherwoods motive for making no inquiries Anger No Jealousy No
Some insult offered her No Larry went through the category of ordinary
motives of possible happenings but he could find none which would
reconcile her very keen and kindly feeling for Hunt with her abstinence
from all inquiries

From his first day in his sanctuary Larry spent long hours every day
over the accounts and documents Miss Sherwood had put in his hands They
were indeed a tangle Originally the Sherwood estate had consisted
of solid realestate holdings But now that Larry had before him
the records of holdings and of various dealings he learned that the
character of the Sherwood fortune had altered greatly Miss Sherwoods
father had neglected the care of this sober business in favor of
speculative investment and even outright gambling in stocks and
Dick possessing this strain of his father and lacking his fathers
experience had and was speculating even more wildly

Larry had followed the market since he had been in a brokers office
almost ten years earlier so he knew what stock values had been and
had some idea of what they were now The records and some of the stock
Larry found in the safe recalled the reputation of the elder Sherwood
He had been known as a spirited daring man who would buy anything or
sell anything he had been several times victimized by sharp traders
some of these outandout confidence men Studying these old records
Larry remembered that the elder Sherwood a dozen years before had lost
a hundred thousand in a mining deal which Old Jimmie Carlisle had helped
manipulate

Larry found hundreds and hundreds of thousands of stock in the safe that
were just so much waste paper and he found records of other hundreds of
thousands in safety deposit vaults that had no greater value The real
estate the more solid and to the male Sherwoods the less interesting
part of the fortune had long been in the care of agents and since
Larry was prohibited from going out and studying the condition and true
value of these holdings he had to depend upon the book valuations and
the agents reports and letters Upon the basis of these valuations he
estimated that some holdings were returning a loss some a bare one and
a half per cent and some running as high as fifteen per cent Larry
found many complaints from tenants some threatening letters from the
Building Department for failure to make ordered alterations to comply
with new building laws and some rather perfunctory letters of advice
and recommendation from the agents themselves

From Miss Sherwood Larry learned that the agents were old men friends
of her father since youth that they had both made comfortable fortunes
which they had no incentive to increase Larry judged that there was no
dishonesty on the part of the agents only laxity and an easy adherence
to the methods of their earlier years when there had not been so much
competition nor so many building laws All the same Larry judged that
the realestate holdings were in a bad way

Larry liked the days and days of this work although the farther he went
the worse did the tangle seem It was the kind of work for which his
faculties fitted him and this was his first chance to use his
faculties upon large affairs in an honest way Thus far his work was all
diagnostic cure construction would not come until laterand perhaps
Miss Sherwood would not trust him with such affairs This investigation
this checking up involved no risk on her part as she had frankly
told him The other would it would mean at least partial control of
property the handling of funds

Miss Sherwood had many sessions with him she was interested but she
confessed herself helpless in this compilation and diagnosis of so
many facts and figures Dick was prompt enough to report his stock
transactions and he was eager enough to discuss the probable
fluctuation of this or that stock but when asked to go over what Larry
had done he refused flatly and goodhumoredly to sit in any such slow
dead game

If my Solomonheaded sister is satisfied with what youre doing
Captain Nemo thats good enough for me he would say So forget that
stuff till Im out of sight Open up Captainwhat do you think copper
is going to do

I wish you could be put on an operatingtable and have your speculative
streak knifed out of you Dick That oil stock you bought the other
daywhy a blind man could have seen it was wildcat And you were
wiped out

Oh the best of em get aboard a bad deal now and then

I know But Ive been tabulating all your deals to date and on the
total youre away behind Better leave the market absolutely alone
Dick and quit taking those big chances

Youve got to take some big chances Captain NemoDick had clung to
the title he had lightly conferred on Larry the morning he had come in
to apologizeor else youll never make any big winnings Besides
I want a run for my money Just getting money isnt enough I want a
little pep in mine

Larry saw that these talks on the unwisdom of speculation he was giving
Dick were not in themselves enough to affect a change in Dick Mere
words were colorless and negative something positive would be required

Larry hesitated before he ventured upon another matter he had long
considered Excuse my saying it Dick But a man whos trying to do
as much in a business way as you are particularly since its plain
speculation cant afford to go to aftertheater shows three times a
week and to late suppers the other four nights Two and three oclock is
no bedtime hour for a business man And that bootlegged booze you drink
when youre out doesnt help you any I know you think Im talking like
a fossilized grandauntbut all the same its the straight stuff Im
handing you

Of course its straight stuffand youre perfectly all right Captain
Nemo With a goodnatured smile Dick clapped him on the shoulder But
Im all right too and nothing and nobody is going to hurt me Got to
have a little fun havent I As for the booze Im merely making hay
while the sun shines Soon therell be no sunI mean no booze

Larry dropped the subject In his old unprincipled days his practice
had been much what he had suggested to Dick as little drink as
possible and as few late nights as possible He had needed all his wits
all the time In this matter of hilarious late hours as in the matter
of speculation Larry recognized words alone however good would have
little effect upon the pleasureloving friendly likable Dick An
event some big experience would be required to check him short and
bring him to his senses

While Larry was keeping at this grind something was happening to Larry
of which he was not then conscious something which was part of the big
development in him that was in time to lead him far A confidence man is
essentially a surething gambler It had been Larrys practice before
the law had tripped him up to study every detail of an enterprise he
was planning to undertake to know the psychology of the individuals
with whom he was dealing to eliminate every perceivable uncertainty
that was what had made almost all of his deals sure things Strip a
clever knave of all intent or inclination for knavery and leave all his
other qualities and practices intact and eager and you have the makings
of a surething business mana man who does not cheat others
and who takes precious care that his every move is sound and
forwardlooking Aside from the moral element involved the difference
between the two is largely a difference in percentage say the
difference between a thousand per cent profit and six per cent profit
The element of trying to play a safe thing still remains

This transformation of character under the stimulus of hard steady
work upon a tangled thing which contained the germ of great constructive
possibilities for some one was what was happening unconsciously to
Larry




CHAPTER XVI


All this while Maggie and what he was to do about her and how do it
was in Larrys mind Even this work he was doing for Miss Sherwood he
was doing also for Maggie in the hope that in some unseen way it might
lead him to her and help lead her to herself There were difficulties
enough between them God knew but of them all two were forever
presenting themselves as foremost first he did not dare go openly to
see her and second even if he so dared he did not know where she was

When he had been with the Sherwoods some three weeks Larry determined
upon a preliminary measure By this time he knew that the letters mailed
from Chicago according to the plan he had arranged with Miss Sherwood
had had their contemplated effect He knew that he was supposed by his
enemies to be in Chicago or some other Western point and that New York
was off its guard as far as he was concerned

His preliminary measure was to discover if possible Maggies
whereabouts The Duchess seemed to him the most likely source of
information He dared not write asking her for this for he was certain
her mail was still being scrutinized The safest method would be to
call at the pawnshop in person the police and his old friends and the
Ginger Bucks would expect anything else before they would expect him to
return to his grandmothers Of course he must use all precautions

Incidentally he was prompted to this method by his desire to see his
grandmother and Hunt He had an idea or two which he had been mulling
over that concerned the artist

He chose a night when a steady blowing rain had driven all but
limousined and most necessitous traffic from the streets The rain was
excuse for a long raincoat with high collar which buttoned under his
nose and a cap which pulled down to his eyes and an umbrella which
masked him from every direct glance Thus abetted and equipped he came
after a taxi ride and a walk into his grandmothers street It was as
seemingly deserted as on that tumultuous night when he had left it and
on this occasion no figures sprang out of the cover of shadows shooting
and cursing He had calculated correctly and unmolested he gained the
pawnshop door passed the solemneyed incurious Isaac and entered the
room behind

His grandmother sat over her accounts at her desk in a corner among her
curios Hunt smoking a black pipe was using his tireless right hand
in a rapid sketch of her another of those swift fewstroked vivid
character notes which were about his studio by the hundreds The
Duchess saw Larry first and she greeted him in the same unsurprised
emotionless manner as on the night he had come back from Sing Sing

Goodevening Larry said she

Goodevening grandmother he returned

Hunt came to his feet knocking over a chair in so doing and gripped
Larrys hand Helloheres our wandering boy tonight How are you
son

Firstrate you old paintslinger And you

Hitting all twelve cylinders and taking everything on high But say
listen youngster how about your copper friends and those guntoting
schoolmates of yours

Missed them so far

Better keep on missing em Hunt regarded him intently for a moment
then asked abruptly Never heard one way or anotherbut did you use
that telephone number I gave you

Yes

Miss Sherwood take care of you

Yes

Still there

Yes

Again Hunt was silent for a moment Larry expected questions about Miss
Sherwood for he knew the quality of the painters interest But Hunt
seemed quite as determined to avoid any personal question relating to
Miss Sherwood as she had been about personal questions relating to him
for his next remark was

Young fellow still keeping all those commandments you wrote for
yourself

So far my bucko

Keep on keeping em and write yourself a few more and youll have a
brandnew decalogue And well have a little Moses of our own But in
the meantime son whats the great idea of coming down here

For one thing I came to ask for a couple of your paintings

My paintings Hunt regarded the other suspiciously What the hell you
want my paintings for

They might make good towels if I can scrape the paint off

Aw cut out the vaudeville stuff I asked you what you wanted my
paintings for Give me a straight answer

All rightheres your straight answer I want your paintings to sell
them

Sell my paintings Say are you trying to say something still funnier

I want them to sell them Remember I once told you that I could sell
themthat I could sell anything Let me have them and then just see

Youd sure have to be able to sell anything to sell them A
challenging glint had come into Hunts eyes Young fellow youre so
damned fresh that if you had any dough Id bet you five thousand any
odds you like that you couldnt even GIVE one of the things away

Loan me five thousand Larry returned evenly and Ill cover the bet
with even moneyit being understood that Im to sell the picture at a
price not less than the highest price you ever received for one of
your pretty pictures which you delight to curse and which made your
fortune Now bring down your picturesor shut up

Hunts jaw set Young fellow I take that bet And Ill not let you
off eitheryoull have to pay it Which pictures do you want

That young Italian woman sitting on the curb nursing her babyand any
other picture you want to put with it

Hunt went clumping up the stairway When he was out of earshot the
Duchess remarked quietly

What did you really come for Larry

Larry was somewhat taken aback by his grandmothers penetration but he
did not try to evade the question nor the steady gaze of the old eyes

I thought you might know where Maggie is and I came to ask

Thats what I thought

Do you know where she is

Yes

Where is she

The old eyes were still steady upon him I dont know that I should
tell you I want you to get onand the less you have to do with Maggie
the better for you

Id like to know grandmother

The Duchess considered for a long space After all youre of ageand
youve got to decide whats best for yourself Ill tell you Maggie was
here the other daydressed simpleto get some letters shed forgotten
to take and which I couldnt find We had a talk Maggie is living at
the Grantham under the name of Margaret Cameron She has a suite there

A suite at the Grantham exclaimed Larry astounded Why the
Grantham is in the same class with the Ritzmore where she used to
workor the Plaza A suite at the Grantham

And then Larry gave a twitching start At the Granthamalone

Not aloneno But its not what just came into your mind Its a woman
thats with her a hired companion And theyre doing everything on a
swell scale

Whats Maggie up to

She didnt tell me except to say that the plan was a big one She was
all excited over it If you want to know just what it is ask Barney
Palmer and Old Jimmie

Barney and Old Jimmie ejaculated Larry And then Barney and Old
Jimmieand a suite at the Grantham

At that moment Hunt came back down the stairway carrying a roll wrapped
in brown paper

Here you are young fellow he announced Demounted em so the junk
would be easier to handle The Dago mother you asked forthe second
painting may be one youd like to have for your own private gallery
Im not going to let you get away with your bluffand dont you forget
it Duchess dont you think hed better beat it before Gavegan
and his loving friends take a tumble to his presence and mess up the
neighborhood

Yes said the Duchess Goodnight Larry

Goodnight said he

Mechanically he took the roll of paintings and slipped it under his
raincoat mechanically he shook hands mechanically he got out of the
pawnshop mechanically he took all precautions in getting out of
the little raindriven street and in getting into a taxicab which he
captured over near Cooper Institute All his mind was upon what the
Duchess had told him and upon a new idea which was throbbingly growing
into a purpose Maggie and Barney and Old Jimmie Maggie in a suite at
the Grantham

What Larry now did as he got into the taxi he would have called
footless and foolhardy an hour before and at any other hour his
judgment might have restrained him But just now he seemed controlled
by a force greater than smoothrunning judgmenta composite of many
forces by sudden jealousy by a sudden desire to shield Maggie by a
sudden desire to see her So as he stepped into the taxi he said

The Granthamquick




CHAPTER XVII


The taxi went rocking up Fourth Avenue But now that decision was made
and he was headed toward Maggie a little of judgment reasserted itself
It would not be safe for him to walk openly into the Grantham with a
mouthful of questions He did not know the number of Maggies suite And
Maggie might not be in So he revised his plan slightly He called to
his driver

Go to the Claridge first

Five minutes later the taxi was in FortyFourth Street and Larry
was stepping out Fortune favored him in one factor perhaps his
subconscious mind had based his plan upon this fact the time was
halfpast ten the theaters still held their crowds the streets were
empty the restaurants were practically unoccupied He was incurring the
minimum of risk

Wait for me he ordered the driver Ill be out in five minutes

In less than the half of the first of these minutes Larry had attained
his first objective the secluded telephoneroom down behind the grill
It was unoccupied except for the telephone girl who was gazing raptly at
the sorrowful romantic and very soiled pages of St Elmo The next
moment she was gazing at something elsea fivedollar bill which Larry
had slipped into the open book

Thats to pay for a telephone call just keep the change he said
rapidly Youre to do all the talking and say just what I tell you

I got you general said the girl emerging with alacrity from romance
to reality Shoot

Call up the Hotel Granthamsay youre a florist with an order to
deliver some flowers direct to Miss Margaret Cameronand ask for the
number of her suiteand keep the wire open

The girl obeyed promptly In less than a minute she was reporting to
Larry

They say 114111421143

Ask if shes in If she is get her on the phone tell her long
distance is calling but doesnt want to speak to her unless she is
alone You get it

Sure brother This aint the first time I helped a party out

There was more jabbing with the switchboard plug evident switching at
the other end several questions and then the girl asked Is this Miss
Margaret Cameron Miss Cameron and so on as per Larrys instructions

The operator turned to Larry She says shes alone

Tell her to hold the wire till you get better connectionsthe storm
has messed up connections terriblyand keep your own wire open and make
her hold her end

As Larry went out he heard his instructions being executed while an
adept hand safely banked the bill inside her shirtwaist Within two
minutes his taxi set him down at the Grantham and knowing that whatever
risks he ran would be lessened by his acting swiftly and without any
suspicious hesitation he walked straight in and to the elevators in
the manner of one having business there his collar again pulled up
his cap pulled down and his face just then covered with a handkerchief
which was caring for a sniffling nose in a highly natural manner

With his heart pounding he got without mishap to the doors numbered
1141 1142 and 1143 Instinctively he knew in a general way what the
apartment was like a set of rooms of various character which the hotel
could rent singly or throw together and rent en suite But which of the
three was the main entrance He dared not hesitate for the slightest
queer action might get the attention of the floor clerk down
the corridor So Larry chose the happy medium and pressed the
motherofpearl button of 1142

The door opened and before Larry stood a large elderly imposing woman
in a rigidly formal evening gowna gown which by the way had been
part of Miss Griersons equipment for many a year for helping raw young
things master the art of being ladies Larry surmised at once that this
was the hired companion his grandmother had spoken of In other days
Larry had had experience with this type and before Miss Grierson could
bar him out or ask a question Larry was in the room and the door closed
behind himand he had entered with the easiest most natural most
polite manner imaginable

You were expecting me inquired Larry with his disarming and wholly
engaging smile

Neither Miss Griersons mind nor body was geared for rapid action She
was taken aback and yet not offended So being at a loss she resorted
to the chief item in her stock in trade her ever dependable dignity

I cannot say that I was In fact sir I do not know who you are

Miss Cameron knowsand she is expecting me Larry returned
pleasantly His quick eyes had noted that this was a sittingroom an
ornate patterned affair which the great hotels seem to order in hundred
lots Where is Miss Cameron

In the next room nodding at the connecting door She is engaged
Telephoning A longdistance call Im quite sure she is not expecting
you Miss Grierson went on to explain ponderously and elaborately
but with politeness for this young man was handsome and pleasant and
wellbred and might prove to be some one of real importance We were
to have had a theater party with supper afterwards but owing to Miss
Camerons indisposition we did not go to the theater But she insisted
on keeping the engagement for the supper but changing it to here
Besides herself and myself there are to be only her uncle her cousin
and just one guest That is why I am so certain sir she is not
expecting you

But you see smiled Larry I am that one guest

Miss Grierson shook her carefully coiffured transformation Ive met
the guest who is coming and I certainly have not met you

Then she must have asked two of us Anyhow Ill just speak to her and
if Im mistaken and de trop Ill withdraw And ere Miss Grierson could
even stir up an intention to intervene further this wellmannered
young man had smiled his disarming smile and bowed to her and had passed
through the door closing it behind him

He halted the knob in his hand Maggie was standing sidewise to him
holding a telephone in her hand its receiver at her ear She must have
supposed that it was Miss Grierson who had so quietly entered for she
did not look around

Yes Im still waiting she was saying impatiently Cant you ever
get that connection

Larry had seen Maggie only in the plain dark suit which she had worn to
her daily business of selling cigarettes at the Ritzmore and once on
the night of his return from Sing Sing in that stage gypsy costume
which though effective was cheap and impromptu and did not at all lift
her out of the environment of the Duchesss ancient and grimy house
But Larry was so startled by this changed Maggie that for the moment
he could not have moved from the door even had he so desired She was
accoutered in the smartest of filmy evening gowns with the short skirt
which was then the mode with highheeled silver slippers her rounded
arms and shoulders and bosom bare her abundant black hair piled high in
careful carelessness The gown was cerise in color and from her forearm
hung a great fan of green plumes In all the hotels and theaters of New
York one could hardly have come upon a figure that night more striking
in its finished and fresh young womanhood Larry trembled all over his
heart tried to throb madly up out of his throat

At length he spoke And all he was able to say was

Maggie

She whirled about and telephone and receiver almost fell from her
hands She went pale and stared at him her mouth agape her dark eyes
wide

LaLarry she whispered

Maggie he said again

LaLarry I thought you were in Chicago

Im here now Maggieespecially to see you He did not know it but
his voice was husky He noted that she was still holding the telephone
and receiver It was I who put in that longdistance call But I came
instead So you might as well hang up

She obeyed and set the instrument upon its little table

Larrywhere have you been all this while

He was now conscious enough to note that there was tense concern in her
manner He exulted at it and crossed and took her hand

Right here in New York Maggie

In hiding

In mighty good hiding

But Larrydont you know its dangerous for you to come out And to
come here of all places

I couldnt help myself I simply had to see you Maggie

He was still holding her hand and there was an instinctive grip of her
fingers about his For a momentthe moment during which her outer or
more conscious self was startled into forgetfulnessthey gazed at each
other silently and steadily eye into eye

And then the things the Duchess had said crept back into his mind and
he said

Maggie Ive come to take you out of all this Get readylets leave
at once

That broke the spell She jerked away from him and instantly she was
the old Maggie the Maggie who had jeered at him and defied him the
night of his return from prison when he had announced his new planthe
Maggie who had flaunted him as stool and squealer the evening she
had left the Duchesss to enter upon this new career

No youre not going to take me out of this she flung at him I
told you once before that I wasnt going your way I told you that I was
going my own way That held for then and it holds for now and it will
hold for always

The softer mood which had come upon him by surprise at sight of her and
filled him now gave way to grim determination Yes you are coming my
waysometime if not now And now if I can make you

Their embattled gazes gripped each other But now Larry was seeing more
than just Maggie He was also taking in the room It was close kin to
the room in which he had left Miss Grierson ornate undistinguished
and very expensive He noted one slight difference a tiny hallway
giving on the corridor its inner door now opened

But the greatest difference was what he saw over Maggies smooth white
shoulders a table all set with china and glass and silver and arranged
for five

Maggie whats this game youre up to he demanded

Its none of your business she said fiercely but in a low tonefor
both were instinctively remembering Miss Grierson in the adjoining room
And then she added proudly But its big Bigger than anything you ever
dreamed of And you can see I am putting it across so farand Ill be
putting it across at the finish Compare it to the cheap line you talked
about Bah

Listen Maggie In his intensity he gripped her bare forearm This is
bad business and if you had any sense youd know it Dont you think
I get the layout Barney is your cousin Old Jimmie is your uncle that
dame in the next room and this suite and your swell clothes to help put
up a front And your sickness that wouldnt let you go to the theater
is just a fake so that not wanting to disappoint them entirely youd
have an excuse for having supper hereand thus adroitly draw some
person into the trap of a more intimate relationship Its a clever and
classy layout Maggie exactly whats your game

Ill not tell you

Whos that man thats coming here

Ill not tell you

Is he the sucker youre out to trim

Ill not tell you

You will tell me he cried dominantly And youre going to get out
of all this You hear me It may look good to you now But I tell you it
has only one finish And thats a rotten finish

She tore free from his punishing grip and pantingly glared at himher
former defiance now an egoistic fury

I wont have you interfering with my lifeyou fake preacheryou
stool you squealer she flung at him madly Stoolsquealer she
repeated I tell you Im going my own wayand its a big wayand I
tell you again nothing you can say or do can stop me If I could have my
best wish all Id wish for would be something to keep you from always
interferingsomething to get you out of my way

Panting she paused Her tense figure with hands closing and unclosing
expressed the very acme of furious defianceof desire to annihilateof
ultimate hatred Larry was astounded by the very extent the profundity
of her passion And so they stood silent except for their quick
breathing eyes fixed upon eyes for several moments

And then a key sounded in the outer door of the little hallway
Instantly there was an almost unbelievable transformation in Maggie
From an imperious uncontrollable fury she changed to a white
quivering thing

Barney she whispered and sprang to the inner door of the little
hallway closed and locked it

She turned on Larry a face that was ghastly in its pallor

Barney always carries a pistol she whispered

They had heard the outer door close with a click of its automatic lock
They now heard the knob of the inner door turn and tugged at and then
heard Barney call Whats the matter Maggie Let us in

Maggie made a supreme effort to reply in a controlled voice

Just a minute Im not quite ready

Then a second voice sounded from the other side of the door

Dont keep us too long Maggie Please

There was a distantly familiar quality to Larry in that second voice
But he did not try to place it then he was too poignantly concerned in
his own situation and in the bewildering change in Maggie

She slipped a hand through his arm Oh LaLarry why did you ever
take such a risk she breathed Her whisper was piteous aquiver with
fright Come this way and she quickly pulled him into the room where
he had met Miss Grierson and to the door by which he had entered

Maggie opened this door Theyre all in the little hallwayI dont
think theyll see you her rapid agitated whisper went on Dont
take the elevators in this corridor theyre in plain sight There are
elevators just around the corner Take them theyre safer Goodbye
Larryand oh Larry dont ever take such a risk again

With that she pushed him out and closed the door

Larry followed her instructions about the elevator he used the same
precautions in leaving that he had used in coming and twenty minutes
later he was back in his room in the Sherwood apartment For an hour or
more he sat motionlessthinkingthinking asking himself questions
but in his tumultuous state of mind and emotions not able to keep to a
question long enough to reason out its possible answer

Just what was that game in which Maggie was involveda game which
required that Grantham setting that eminently respectable companion
and Maggies accouterment as a young lady of obvious wealth

Whose was that vaguely familiar second voicethat voice which he still
could not place

But what he thought about most of all was something very different What
had caused that swift change in Maggiefrom a fury that was both
fire and granite to that pallid quivering whispering girl who had so
rapidly led him safely out of his danger

To and fro back and forth shuttled these questions Toward two oclock
he stood up mind still absorbed and mechanically started to undress
He then observed the roll of paintings Hunt had given him Better for
them if they were flattened out Mechanically he removed string and
paper There on top was the Italian mother he had asked for A great
paintinga truly great painting Mechanically he lifted this aside to
see what was the second painting Hunt had included Larry gave a great
start and the Italian mother went flapping to the floor

The second painting was of Maggie the one on which Hunt had been
working the day Larry had come back Maggie in her plain working
clothes looking out at the world confidently conqueringly the
painting in which Hunt his brain teeming with ideas had tried to
express the Maggie that was the many Maggies that were in her and the
Maggie that was yet to be




CHAPTER XVIII


The next morning Larry tried to force his mind to attend strictly to
Miss Sherwoods affairs But in this effort he was less than fifty
per cent effective His experience of the night before had been too
exciting too provocative of speculation too involved with what he
frankly recognized to be the major interest of his life to allow him
to apply himself with perfect and unperturbed concentration to the days
routine Constantly he was seeing the transformed Maggie in the cerise
evening gown with the fan of green plumesseeing her elaborate
setting in her suite at the Granthamhearing that vaguely familiar but
unplaceable voice outside her doorrecalling the frenzied effort with
which Maggie had so swiftly effected his escape

This last matter puzzled him greatly If she were so angered at him as
she had declared if she so distrusted him why had she not given him up
when she had had him at her mercy Could it be that despite her words
she had an unacknowledged liking for him He did not dare let himself
believe this

Again and again he thought of this adventure in whose very middle Maggie
now was and of whose successful issue she had proudly boasted to him
It was indeed something big as she had said that establishment at the
Grantham was proof of this Larry could now perceive the adventures
general outlines There was nothing original in what he perceived and
the plan so far as he could see it would not have interested him in
the least as a novel creation of the brain were not Maggie its central
figure and were not Barney and Old Jimmie her directing agents
A pretty woman was being used as a lure to some rich man and his
infatuation for her was to cause him to part with a great deal of
money some variation of this ancient idea which has a thousand
variationsthat was the plan

Obviously the enterprise was not directed at some gross victim whose
palate might permit his swallowing anything If any one item essentially
proved this it was the item of the overwhelmingly respectable chaperon
Maggie was being presented as an innocent respectable young girl and
the victim whoever he was was the type of man for whom only such a
type of girl would have a compelling appeal

And this manwho was he Ever and again he tried to place the mans
voice with its faintly familiar quality but it kept dodging away like
a dream one cannot quite recall

The whole business made Larry rage within himself Maggie to be used
in such a way He did not blame Maggie for he understood her Also he
loved her She was young proud willful had been trained to regard
such adventures as colorful and legitimate and had not lived long
enough for experience to teach her otherwise No Maggie was not to
blame But Old Jimmie He would like to twist Old Jimmies neck But
then Old Jimmie was Maggies father and the mere fact of Old Jimmie
being Maggies father would he knew safeguard the old man from his
wrath even were he at liberty to go forth and act

He cursed his enforced seclusion If only he were free to go out and
do his best in the open But then even if he were his best endeavors
would have little influence upon Maggiewith her despising and
distrusting him as she did and with her so determined to go ahead in
her own way

Once during the morning he slipped from the library into his room
and gazed at the portrait of Maggie that Hunt had given him the night
before Maggie selfconfident willful a beautiful nobody who was
staring the world out of countenance a Maggie that was a thousand
possible Maggies And as he gazed he thought of the wager he had made
with Hunt and of his own rather scatterbrained plannings concerning
it He removed Maggies portrait from the fellowship of the picture of
the Italian mother and hid it in his chiffonier Whatever he might do
in his endeavor to make good his boast to Hunt for the present he would
regard Maggies portrait as his private property To use the painting as
he had vaguely planned before he had been surprised to find it Maggies
portrait would be to pass it on into other possession where it
might become publicwhere through some chance the Maggie of the
workinggirls cheap shirtwaist might be identified with the rich Miss
Cameron of the Grantham to Maggies great discomfiture and possibly to
her entanglement with the police

When Miss Sherwood came into the library a little later Larry tried to
put Maggie and all matters pertaining to his previous nights adventure
out of his mind He had enough other affairs which he was trying
adroitly to handlefor instance Miss Sherwood and Hunt and when his
business talk with her was ended he remarked

I saw Mr Hunt last evening

He watched her closely but he could detect no flash of interest at
Hunts name

You went down to your grandmothers

Yes

That was a very great risk for you to take she reproved him Im
glad you got back safely

Despite the disturbance Maggie had been to his thoughts part of his
brain had been trying to make plans to forward this other aim so he
now told Miss Sherwood of his wager with Hunt and his bringing away
a picturehe said one picture He wanted to awaken the suppressed
interest each had in the other to help bridge or close the chasm which
he sensed had opened between them So he brought the picture of the
Italian mother from his room She regarded it critically but with no
sign of approval or disapproval

What do you think of it she asked

Its a most remarkable piece of work he said emphaticallywishing he
could bring in that picture of Maggie as additional evidence supporting
his opinion

She made no further comment and it was up to Larry to keep the
conversation alive What is the most Mr Hunt ever was paid for a
painting I mean one of what he swears at as his pretty pictures

I believe about two thousand dollars

That was part of the information necessary to Larrys plan

Miss Sherwood Im going to ask another favor of you In connection
with a bet I made with Mr Hunt I want to talk with a picture
dealerthe best one there is I cant very well go to him Can you
manage to have him come here

Easily I know the man best for your purpose Ill telephone and if
hes in New York hell come to see you this afternoon

Thank you

She started out then turned Better finish your business with him
today if you can We go to the country tomorrow or the day after Ive
just had word that the workmen are finally out of the house though the
grounds of course are in bad shape and will probably remain so With
this labor situation its practically impossible to get men

Larry remembered something else Miss Sherwood you recall my once
speaking about a man I got to be friends with in prisonJoe Ellison

Yes

Ive written him under an assumed name of course and have had an
answer Hell be out in a very few days now Hes through with his old
ways I know hed like nothing better than a quiet place to work off to
himself somewhere Im sure you can trust him

Well arrange to have him come out to Cedar Crest Oh dont think Im
being generous or sentimental she interrupted smilingly as he started
to thank her Id be glad to put two or three more exconvicts to work
on our place if I could get them And so would my friends they cant
get workmen of any kind

That afternoon the picture dealer came Miss Sherwood introduced Larry
to him as Mr Brandon her cousin and then left the two men together
Larry appraised Mr Graham as a shrewd man who knew his business and who
would like to score a triumph in his own particular field He decided
that the dealer had to be handled with a great deal of frankness and
with some stiff bluffing which must appear equally frank The secret
of Larrys earlier success had been to establish confidence and even
enthusiasm in something which had little or no value In selling an
honest thing at an honest price the first and fundamental procedure was
the same to establish confidence and if possible enthusiasm

From the moment of introduction Larry quietly assumed the manner of an
art collector who was very sure of himself which manner was abetted by
the setting of the Sherwood library He felt something of the old zest
when wits had been matched against wits even though this was to be a
strictly honorable enterprise

You know the work of Mr Jerome Hunt he asked

I have handled practically all his work since he began to sell
replied Mr Graham

I was referring to work in his recent manner

He has not been doing any work recently corrected Mr Graham

No Larry picked up the Italian mother which for this occasion he had
mounted with thumbtacks upon a drawingboard and stood it upon a chair
in the most advantageous light There is a little thing in Mr Hunts
recent manner which I lately purchased

Mr Graham regarded the painting long and critically

Finally he remarked

At least it is different

Different and better said Larry with his quiet positiveness So much
better that I paid him three thousand dollars for it

Three thousand The dealer regarded Larry sharply Three thousand for
that

Yes And I consider that I got a bargain

Mr Graham was silent for several moments Then he said For what reason
have I been asked here

I want you to undertake to sell this picture

For how much

Five thousand dollars

Five thousand dollars

It is easily worth five thousand Larry said quietly

If you value it so highly why do you want to sell

I am pressed by the present money shortage Also I secured a second
picture when I got this one That second picture I shall not sell You
should have no difficulty in selling this Larry continued if you
handle the matter right Think of how people have started again to talk
about Gaugin about his starting to paint in a new manner down there in
the Marquesas Islands of his trading a picture for a stick of furniture
or selling it for a few hundred francswhich same paintings are now
each worth a small fortune Capitalize this Gaugin talk also the talk
about poor mad Blakeslie Youve got a new sensation One all your own

You cant start a sensation with one painting Mr Graham remarked
dryly

This had been the very remark Larry had adroitly been trying to draw
from the dealer

Why thats so he exclaimed And then as if the thought had only that
moment come to him Why not have an exhibition of paintings done in his
new manner Hes got a studio full of things just as characteristic as
this one

Larry caught the gleam which came into the dealers eyes It was
instantly masked

Too late in the spring for a picture show Couldnt put on an
exhibition before next season

But why not have a private preexhibition showing Larry arguedwith
special invitations sent to a small carefully chosen list putting it
over strong to them that you were offering them the chance of a first
and exclusive view of something very remarkable Most of them will feel
flattered and will come And that will start talk and stir up interest
in your public exhibition in the fall Thats the idea

Again there was the gleam quickly masked in the dealers eyes But
Larry got it

How do I know this picture here isnt just an accidentthe only one
of the sort Mr Hunt has ever painted or ever will paint cautiously
inquired Mr Graham You said you had a second picture May I see it

Larry hesitated But he believed he had the dealer almost sold a
little more and Mr Graham would be convinced So he brought in Maggies
portrait The dealer looked it over with a face which he tried to keep
expressionless

How much is this one he asked at length

It is not for sale

It will bring more money than the other Its a more interesting
subject

Thats why Im keeping it said Larry I think youll admit Mr
Graham that this proves that Mr Hunt is not now painting accidents

Youre right The mask suddenly dropped from Mr Grahams face he was
no longer merely an art merchant he was also an art enthusiast Hunt
has struck something bold and fresh and I think I can put him over
Ill try that scheme you mentioned Tell me where I can find him and
Ill see him at once

That picture has got to be sold before I give you his address No use
seeing him until then hed laugh at you and not listen to anything
Hes sore at the world thinks it doesnt understand him An actual sale
would be the only argument that would have weight with him

All rightIll buy the picture myself Hunt and I have had a falling
out and Id like him to have proof that I believe in him Again Mr
Graham was the art merchant Though of course I cant pay the five
thousand you ask Hunts new manner may catch on and it may not Its a
big gamble

What will you pay

What you paid for itthree thousand

Thats an awful drop from what I expected When can you pay it

Ill send you my check by an assistant as soon as I get back to my
place

I told you I was squeezed financiallyso the picture is yours Ill
send you Mr Hunts present address when I receive your check Make it
payable to cash

When Mr Graham had gone with the Italian motherit was then the very
end of the afternoonLarry wondered if his plan to draw Hunt out of his
hermitage was going to succeed and wondered what would be the result
if any upon the relationship between Hunt and Miss Sherwood if Hunt
should come openly back into his world an acclaimed success and
come with the changed attitude toward every one and every thing that
recognition bestows

But something was to make Larry wonder even more a few minutes later
Dick that habitual late riser had had to hurry away that morning
without speaking to him Now when he came home toward six oclock Dick
shouted cheerily from the hallway

Ahoy Where you anchored Captain Nemo

Larry did not answer He sat over his papers as one frozen He knew
now whose had been the elusively familiar voice he had heard outside
Maggies door It was Dick Sherwoods

Dick paused without to take some messages from Judkins and Larrys mind
raced feverishly Dick Sherwood was the victim Maggie and Barney and Old
Jimmie were so cautiously and elaborately trying to trim It seemed an
impossible coincidence But no not impossible after all Their net
had been spread for just such game a young man impressionable
pleasureloving with plenty of money and with no strings tied to his
spending of it That Barney should have made his acquaintance was easily
explained to establish acquaintance with such persons as Dick was
Barneys specialty What more natural than that the highspirited
irresponsible Dick should fall into this trapor indeed that he should
have been picked out in advance as the ideal victim and have been drawn
into it

Hello there grumbled Dick entering Why didnt you answer a
shipmates hail

I heard you but just then I was adding a column of figures and I knew
youd look in

At that moment Larry noted the portrait of Maggie looking up from the
chair beside him With a swiftness which he tried to disguise into a
mechanical action he seized the painting and rolled it up face inside

Whats that youve got demanded Dick

Just a little daub of my own

So you paint too What else can you do Lets have a look

Its too rotten Id rather let you see something elsethough all my
stuff is bad

You wouldnt do any little thing would you to brighten this tiredest
hour in the day of a tired business man complained Dick Ive really
been a business man today Captain Worked like the devilor an
angelwhichever works the harder

He lit a cigarette and settled with a sigh on the corner of Larrys
desk Larry regarded him with a stranger and more contradicting
mixture of feelings than he had ever thought to contain solicitude for
Dickjealousy of himand the instinct to protect Maggie This last
seemed to Larry grotesquely absurd the instant it seethed up in him but
there the instinct was was Dick treating Maggie right

How was the show last night Dick

Punk

I thought you said you were to see The Jest Ive heard its one of
the best things for years

Oh I guess the shows all right But the company was poor My company
I mean The person I wanted to see couldnt come

Hope you had a supper party that made up for the disappointment
pursued Larry adroitly trying to lead him on

I sure had that Captain

Dick slid to a chair beside Larry dropped a hand on Larrys knee and
said in a lowered tone

Captain Ive recently met a new girland believe me shes a
knockout

Better keep clear of those show girls Dick

Never again The last one cured me for life Miss CameronMaggie
Cameron hows that for a nameis no Broadway girl Captain Shes not
even a New York girl

No

Shes from some place out West Father owned several big ranches She
says that explains her crudeness Her crude I should say not They
dont grow better manners right here in New York And shes pretty and
clever and utterly naive about everything in New York Though I must
say Dick added that Im not so keen about her cousin and her uncle
Id met the cousin a few times the last year or two around town he
belongs here The two are the sort of poor stock that crops out in every
good family Theyve got one merit though they dont try to impose on
her too much

What is your Miss Cameron doing in New York

Having her first look at the town before going to some resort for the
summer perhaps taking a cottage somewhere I say Captainleaning
closerI wish you didnt feel you had to stick around this apartment
so tight Id like to take you out and introduce you to her

Larry could imagine the resulting scene if ever this innocently proposed
introduction were given

I guess that for the present Ill have to depend upon your reports
Dick

Well you can take it from me that shes just about all right

It was Larrys strange instinct to protect Maggie that prompted his next
remark

Youre not just out joyriding are you Dick

Dick flushed Nothing of that sort Shes not that kind of girl
BesidesI think its the real thing Captain

The honest look in Dicks eyes even more than his words quieted
Larrys fear for Maggie Presently Dick walked out leaving Larry yet
another problem added to his life He could not let anything happen
to Maggie He could not let anything happen to Dick He had to protect
each he had to do something Yet what could he do

Yes this certainly was a problem He paced the room another victim of
the ancient predicament of divided and antagonistic duty




CHAPTER XIX


The night of Larrys unexpected call upon her at the Grantham Maggie
had pulled herself together and aided by the imposing Miss Grierson had
done her best as ingenue hostess to her pseudocousin Barney and her
pseudouncle Old Jimmie and to their quarry Dick Sherwood whom
they were so cautiously stalking But when Dick had gone and when Miss
Grierson had withdrawn to permit her charge a little visit with her
relatives Barney had been prompt with his dissatisfaction

What was the matter with you tonight Maggie he demanded You
didnt play up to your usual form

If you dont like the way I did it you may get some one else Maggie
snapped back

Aw dont get sore If Im stagemanaging this show I guess its my
business to tell you how to act the part and to tell you when youre
endangering the success of the piece by giving a poor performance

Maybe youd better get some one else to take my part right now

Maggies tone and look were implacable Barney moved uneasily That was
the worst about Maggie she wouldnt take advice from any one unless the
advice were a coincidence with or an enlargement of her own wishes and
she was particularly temperish tonight He hastened to appease her

I guess the best of us have our off days Its all right
unlessBarney hesitated business fear and jealousy suddenly seizing
himunless the way you acted tonight means you dont intend to go
through with it

Why shouldnt I go through with it

No reason Unless you acted as you did tonight becauseagain Barney
hesitated again jealousy prompted him onbecause youve heard in some
way from Larry Brainard Have you heard from Larry

Maggie met his gaze without flinching She would take the necessary
measures in the morning with Miss Grierson to keep that lady from
indiscreet talking

I have not heard from Larry and if I had it wouldnt be any of your
business Barney Palmer

He chose to ignore the verbal slap in his face of her last phrase No
I guess you havent heard from Larry And I guess none of us will hear
from himnot for a long time Hes certainly fixed himself for fair

He sure has agreed Old Jimmie

Maggie said nothing

Seems to me weve got this young Sherwood hooked said Old Jimmie who
had been impatient during this unprofitable bickering Seems to me
its time to settle just how were going to get his dough How about it
Barney

Plenty of time for that Jimmie This is a big fish and weve got to
be absolutely sure weve got him hooked so he cant get off Weve got
to play safe here its worth waiting for believe me Besides all the
while Maggies getting practice

Seems to me we ought to make our cleanup quick So thatso that

See hereyou think you got some other swell game you want to use
Maggie in

Old Jimmies shifty gaze wavered before Barneys glare

No But shes my daughter aint she

Yes But whos running this Barney demanded Thank Heavens Old
Jimmie was one person he did not have to treat like a prima donna

You are

Then shut up and let me run it

You might at least tell if youve decided how youre going to run it
persisted Old Jimmie

Will you shut up snapped Barney

Old Jimmie said no more And having asserted his supremacy over at least
one of the two Barney relented and condescended to talk lounging back
in his chair with that selfconscious grace which had helped make him a
figure of increasing note in the gayer restaurants of New York

It did not enter into Barneys calculations present or for the future
to make Maggie the mistress of any man Not that Barney was restrained
by moral considerations The thing was just bad business Such a woman
makes but comparatively little and what is worse if she chooses she
makes it all for herself And Barney in his cynical wisdom of his poor
world further knew that the average man enticed into this poor trap
after the woman has said yes and after the first brief freshness has
lost its bloom becomes a tightwad and there is little real money to be
got from him for any one

Its like this once weve got this Sherwood bird safely hooked
expanded Barney with the air of an authority flicking off his cigarette
ash with his best restaurant manner we can play the game a hundred
ways But the marriage proposition is the best bet and there are two
best ways of working that

Which dyou think we ought to use Barney inquired Old Jimmie

But Barney went on as if the older man had not asked a question Both
ways depend upon Sherwood being crazy in love and upon his coming
across with a proposal and sticking to it The first way after being
proposed to Maggie must break down and confess shes married to a man
she doesnt love and who doesnt love her This husband would probably
give her a divorce but hes a cagy guy and is out for the coin and
if he smelled that she wanted to remarry some one with money he would
demand a large price for her freedom Maggie must further confess that
she really has no money and is therefore helpless Then Sherwood offers
to meet the terms of this brute of a husband If Sherwood falls for this
we shove in a dummy husband who takes Sherwoods doughand a big
bank roll it will beand thatll be the last Sherwoodll ever see of
Maggie

Old Jimmie nodded When its worked right that always brings home the
kale

The only question is continued Barney can Maggie put that stuff
over How about it Maggie Think youre good enough to handle a
proposition like that

Looking the handsome Barney straight in the eyes Maggie for the moment
thought only of his desire to manage her and of the challenge in his
tone Larry and the appeal he had made to her were forgotten as was
also Dick Sherwood

Anything youre good enough to think up Barney Palmer I guess Im
good enough to put over she answered coolly

And then Whats the other way she asked

Old stuff Have to be a sureenough marriage Sherwoods are bigtime
people you know a sister whos a regular somebody After marriage
family permitted to learn truthperhaps something much worse
than truth Family horrified They pay Maggie a big wad for
a separationsame as so many horrified families get rid of
daughtersinlaw they dont like Which of the ways suits you best
Maggie

Maggie shrugged her shoulders with indifference It suited her present
mood to maintain her attitude of being equal to any enterprise

Which do you like best Barney Old Jimmie asked

The second is safer But then its slower and there would be lawyers
fees which would eat into our profits and then because of the publicity
we might have to wait some time before it would be safe to use Maggie
again The first plan isnt so complicated its quick and at once
weve got Maggie free to use in other operations The first looks the
best bet to mebut as I said we dont have to decide yet We can let
developments help make the actual decision for us

Barney did not add that a further reason for his objecting to the second
plan was that he didnt want Maggie actually tied in marriage to any
man That was a relationship his hopes were reserving for himself

Barneys inborn desire for acknowledged chieftainship again craved
assertion and pressed him on to say

You see Maggie how much depends on you Youve got a whale of a
chance for a beginner I hope you take a big brace over tonight and
play up to the possibilities of your part

You take care of your end and Ill take care of mine was her sharp
retort

Barney was flustered for a moment by his second failure to dominate
Maggie Oh well well not row he tried to say easily We
understand each other and were each trying to help the other fellows
gamethats the main point

The two men left Jimmie without kissing his daughter goodnight This
caused Maggie no surprise A kiss not the lack of it would have been
the thing that would have excited wonder in Maggie

Barney went away well satisfied on the whole with the manner in which
the affair was progressing and with his management of it and of Maggie
Maggie was obstinate to be sure but hed soon work that out of her He
was now fully convinced of the soundness of his explanation of Maggies
poor performance of that night she had just had an off day

As for Maggie after they had gone she sat up long thinkingand
her thoughts reverted irresistibly to Larry His visit had been most
distracting But she was not going to let it affect her purpose If
anything she was more determined than ever to be what she had told him
she was going to be to prove to him that he could not influence her

She tried to keep her mind off Larry but she could not He was for her
so many questions How had he escapedthrown off both police and old
friends Where was he now What was he doing And when and how was he
going to reappear and interferefor Maggie had no doubt now that she
knew him to be in New York that he would come again and again try to
check her

And there was a matter which she no more understood than Larry and this
was another of her questions Why had she gone into a panic and aided
his escape

Of course she now and then thought of Dick Sherwood She rather liked
Dick But thus far she regarded him exactly as her scheme of life had
presented him to her as a pleasant dupe who in an exciting play in
which she had the thrilling lead was to be parted from his money She
was rather sorry for him but this was business and her sorrow was not
going to interfere with what she was going to do

Maggie Cameron at this period of her life was not deeply
introspective She did not realize what according to other standards
this thing was which she was doing She was merely functioning as she
had been taught to function And if any change was beginning in her she
was thus far wholly unconscious of it




CHAPTER XX


Larrys new problem was the most difficult and delicate dilemma of his
lifethis divided loyalty to balk Maggie and the two men behind
her without revealing the truth about Maggie to Dick to protect Dick
without betraying Maggie It certainly was a trying baffling situation

He had no such foolish idea that he could change Maggie by exposing
her At best he would merely render her incapable of continuing this
particular course he would increase her bitterness and hostility to
him Anyhow according to the remnants of his old code that wouldnt be
playing fairparticularly after her aiding his escape when he had been
trapped

Upon only one point was he clear and on this he became more settled
with every hour whatever he did he must do with the idea of a
fundamental awakening in Maggie Merely to foil her in this one scheme
would be to solve the lesser part of his problem Maggie would be left
unchanged or if changed at all the change would be toward a greater
hardness and his major problem would be made more difficult of
solution

He considered many ways He thought of seeing Maggie again and once
more appealing to her That he vetoed not because of the danger to
himself but because he knew Maggie would not see him and if he again
did break in upon her unexpectedly in her obstinate pride she would
heed nothing he said He thought of seeing Barney and Old Jimmie and
somehow so throwing the fear of God into that pair that they would
withdraw Maggie from the present enterprise but even if he succeeded
in so hazardous an undertaking again Maggie would be left unchanged
He thought of showing Miss Sherwood the hidden portrait of Maggie of
telling her all and asking her aid but this he also vetoed for it
seemed a betrayal of Maggie

He kept going back to one plan not a plan exactly but the idea upon
which the right plan might be based If only he could adroitly with his
hand remaining unseen place Maggie in a situation where circumstances
would appeal conqueringly to her best self to her latent sense of
honorthat was the idea But cudgel his brain as he would Larry could
not just then develop a working plan whose foundation was that idea

But even if Larry had had a brilliant plan it would hardly have been
possible for him to have devoted himself to its execution for two days
after his visit to Maggie at the Grantham the Sherwoods moved out to
their summer place some forty miles from the city on the North Shore of
Long Island and Larry was so occupied with routine duties pertaining
to this migration that at the moment he had time for little else Cedar
Crest was individual yet typical of the better class of Long Island
summer residences It was a long white building of many piazzas and many
wings set on a bluff looking over the Sound with a broad stretch of
silken lawn and about it gardens in their June glory and behind the
house a couple of hundred acres of scrub pine

On the following day according to a plan that had been worked out
between Larry and Miss Sherwood Joe Ellison appeared at Cedar Crest
and was given the assistant gardeners cottage which stood apart on
the bluff some three hundred yards east of the house He was a tall
slightly bent whitehaired man apparently once a man of physical
strength and dominance of character and with the outer markings of a
gentleman but now seemingly a mere shadow of the forceful man of his
prime As a matter of fact Joe Ellison had barely escaped that greatest
of prison scourges tuberculosis

The roses were given over to his care For a few brief years during the
height of his prosperity he had owned a small place in New Jersey and
during that period had seemingly been the country gentleman Flowers had
been his hobby so that now he could have had no work which would have
more suited him than this guardianship of the roses For himself he
desired no better thing than to spend what remained of his life in this
sunlit privacy and communion with growing things

He gripped Larrys hand when they were first alone in the little
cottage Thanks Larry Ill not forget this he said He said little
else He did not refer to his prison life or what had gone before it
He had never asked Larry even while in prison together about Larrys
previous activities and associates and he asked no questions now
Apparently it was the desire of this silent man to have the bones of his
own past remain buried and to leave undisturbed the graves of others
mistakes

A retiring unobtrusive figure he settled quickly to his work He
seemed content even happy and at times there was a faraway exultant
look in his gray eyes Miss Sherwood caught this on several occasions
it puzzled her and she spoke of it to Larry Larry understood what lay
behind Joes bearing and since the thing had never been told to him as
a secret he retold that portion of Joes history he had recited to the
Duchess of a child who had been brought up among honorable people
protected from the knowledge that her father was a convicta child Joe
never expected to see and did not even know how to find

Joe Ellison became a figure that moved Miss Sherwood deeply content to
busy himself in his earthly obscurity ever dreaming and gloating over
his one great sustaining thoughtthat he had given his child the best
chance which circumstances permitted that he had removed himself from
his childs life that some unknown where out in the world his child
was growing to maturity among clean wholesome people that he never
expected to make himself known to his child The situation also moved
Larry profoundly whenever he looked at his old friend merging into a
kindly fellowship with the earth

But while busy with new affairs at Cedar Crest Larry was all the while
thinking of Maggie and particularly of his own dilemma regarding Maggie
and Dick But the right plan still refused to take form in his brain
However one important detail occurred to him which required immediate
attention If his procedure in regard to Hunts pictures succeeded in
drawing the painter from his hermitage nothing was more likely than
that Hunt unexpectedly would happen upon Maggie in the company of Dick
Sherwood That might be a catastrophe to Larrys unformed plan it had
to be forestalled if possible Such a matter could not be handled in a
letter with the police opening all mail coming to the Duchesss house
So once more he decided upon a secret visit to the Duchesss house He
figured that such a visit would be comparatively without risk since the
police and Barney Palmer and the gangsters Barney had put upon his trail
all still believed him somewhere in the West

Accordingly a few nights after they had settled at Cedar Crest he
motored into New York in a roadster Miss Sherwood had placed at his
disposal and after the necessary precautions he entered Hunts studio
The room was dismantled and Hunt sat among his packed belongings
smoking his pipe

Well young fellow growled Hunt after they had shaken hands you see
youve driven me from my happy home

Then Mr Graham has been to see you

Yes And he put up to me your suggestion about a private exhibition
And I fell for it And Ive got to go back among the people I used
to know And wear good clothes and put on a set of standardized good
manners Hell

You dont like it

I suppose if the exhibition is a go Ill like grinning at the bunch
that thought I couldnt paint You bet Ill like that You young
fellowI suppose youre here to gloat over me and to try to collect
your five thousand

I never gloat over doing such an easy job as that was And Im not here
to collect my bet As far as money is concerned Im here to give you
some And he handed Hunt the check made out to cash which Mr Graham
had sent him for the Italian mother

Better keep that on account of what I owe you advised Hunt

Id rather youd hold it for me And better still Id rather call the
bet off in favor of a new bargain

Whats the new proposition for swindling me

You need a business nursemaid What commission do you pay dealers

Been paying those burglars forty per cent

Thats too much for doing nothing Heres my proposition Give me ten
per cent to act as your personal agent and Ill guarantee that your
total percentage for commissions will be less than at present and that
your prices will be doubled Of course I cant do much while the police
and others are so darned interested in me so if you accept well just
date the agreement from the time Im cleared

Youre on sonand well just date the agreement from the present
moment AD Again Hunt gripped Larrys hand Youre all to the good
Larryand Im not giving you half enough

That provided Larry with the opening he had desired You can make it up
to me

How

By helping me out with a proposition of my own To come straight to the
point its Maggie

Maggie

I guess you know how I feel there Shes got a wrong set of ideas and
shes fixed in themand you know how highspirited she is Shes out in
the world now trying to put something crooked over which she thinks is
big I know what it is I want to stop her and change her Thats my
big aimto change her The only way I can at this moment stop what
she is now doing is by exposing her And mighty few people with a wrong
twist are ever set right by merely being exposed

I guess youre right there Larry

What I want is a chance to try another method on Maggie If shes
handled right I think she may turn out a very different person from what
she seems to besomething that may surprise both of us

Hunt nodded That was why I painted her picture Since I first saw her
Ive been interested in how she was going to come out She might become
anything But where do I fit in

Shes flying in high company It occurred to me that when you got back
to your own world you might meet her and in your surprise you might
speak to her in a manner which would be equivalent in its effect to an
intentional exposure I wanted to put you on your guard and to ask you
to treat her as a stranger

Thats promised I wont know her

Dont promise till you know the rest

What else is there to know

Who the sucker is theyre trying to trim Larry regarded the other
steadily You know him Hes Dick Sherwood

Dick Sherwood exploded Hunt Are you sure about that

I was with Maggie the other night when Dick came to have supper with
her he didnt see me Besides Dick has told me about her

How did they ever get hold of Dick

Dicks the easiest kind of fish for two such smooth men as Barney and
Old Jimmie when theyve got a clever goodlooking girl as bait and
when they know how to use her Hes generous easily impressed thinks
he is a wise man of the world and is really very gullible

Have they got him hooked

Hard and fast It wont be his fault if they dont land him

The painter gazed at Larry with a hard look Then he demanded abruptly

Show Miss Sherwood that picture of Maggie I painted

No I had my reasons

What you going to do with it

Keep it and pay you your top price for it when Ive got the money

Hm Told Miss Sherwood whats doing about Dick

No

Why not

I thought of doing it then I decided against it For the same reason
I just gave youthat it might lead to exposure and that exposure would
defeat my plans

You seem to be forgetting that your plan leaves Dick in danger Dick
deserves some consideration

And Im giving it to him argued Larry Im thinking of him as much
as of Maggie Or almost as much His sister and friends have pulled him
out of a lot of scrapes Hes not a bit wiser or better for that kind
of help And its not going to do him any good whatever to have some one
step in and take care of him again Hes been a good friend to me but
hes a dear fool I want to handle this so hell get a jolt that will
waken him upmake him take his responsibilities more seriouslymake
him able to take care of himself

Huh grunted Hunt Youve certainly picked out a few mansized jobs
for yourself to make a success of the straight life for yourselfto
come out ahead of the police and your old palsto make Maggie love the
Ten Commandmentsto put me acrossto make Dick into a levelheaded
citizen Any other little item youd like to take on

Larry ignored the irony of the question Some of those things Im going
to do he said confidently And any I see Im going to fail in Ill
get warning to the people involved But to come back to your promise
are you willing to give your promise now that you know all the facts

Hunt pulled for a long moment at his pipe Then he said almost gruffly

I guess youve guessed that Isabel Sherwood is about the most important
person in the world to me

That was the nearest Hunt had ever come to telling that he loved Miss
Sherwood Larry nodded

Im in bad there already Suppose your foot slips and everything about
Dick goes wrong Whatll be my situation when she learns Ive known all
along and have just stood by quietly and let things happen See what
Ill be letting myself in for

I do said Larry his spirits sinking And of course I can understand
your decision not to give your promise

Who said I wouldnt give my promise demanded Hunt Of course I
give my promise All I said was that the weather bureau of my bad toe
predicts that theres likely to be a storm because of thisand I want
you to use your brain son I want you to use your brain

He upreared his big shaghaired figure and gripped Larrys hand
Youre all right Larryand heres wishing you luck Now get to hell
out of here before Gavegan and Casey drop in for a cup of tea or your
old friends begin target practice with their hip artillery I want a
little quiet in which to finish my packing

And say son he added as he pushed Larry through the door dont
fall dead at the sight of me when you see me next for Im likely to be
walking around inside all the finery and vanity of Fifth Avenue




CHAPTER XXI


Larry came down the stairway from Hunts studio in a mood of high
elation Through Hunts promise of cooperation he had at least made a
start in his unformed plan regarding Maggie Somehow hed work out and
put across the rest of it

Then Hunts prediction of the trouble that might rise through
his silence recurred to Larry Indeed that was a delicate
situationcontaining all kinds of possible disasters for himself as
well as for Hunt He would have to be most watchful most careful or he
would find himself entangled in worse circumstances than at present

As he came down into the little back room his grandmother was sitting
over her interminable accounts each of which represented a little
profit to herself some a little relief to many some a tragedy to a
few and many of which were in code for these represented transactions
of a character which no pawnshop particularly one reputed to be a
fence wishes ever to have understood by those presumptive busybodies
the police When Larry had first entered she had merely given him an
unsurprised goodevening and permitted him to pass on But now as
he told her goodnight and turned to leave she said in her thin
monotonous voice

Sit down for a minute Larry I want to talk to you

Larry obeyed Yes grandmother

But the Duchess did not at once speak She held her redrimmed
unblinking eyes on him steadily Larry waited patiently Though she was
so composed so selfcontained Larry knew her well enough to know that
what was passing in her mind was something of deep importance at least
to her

At length she spoke You saw Maggie that night you hurried away from
here

Yes grandmother Have you heard from her since theor from Barney or
Old Jimmie

The Duchess shook her head Do you mind telling me what happened that
nightand what Maggies doing

Larry told her of the scene in Maggies suite at the Grantham told of
the plan in which Maggie was involved and of his own added predicament
This last the Duchess seemingly ignored

Just about what I supposed she was doing she said And you tried
again to get her to give it up

Yes

And she refused

Yes And he added Refused more emphatically than before

The Duchess studied him a long moment Then Youre not trying to make
her give that up just because you think shes worth saving You like her
a lot Larry

I love her Larry admitted

Im sorry about that Larry There was real emotion in the old voice
now Ive told you that youre all Ive got left And now that
youve at last started right I want everything to go right with you
Everything And Maggie will never help things go right with you Your
love for her can only mean misery and misfortune You cant change her

Larry came out with the questions he had asked himself so frequently
these last days But why did her manner change so when she heard Barney
and the others Why did she help me escape

That was because deep down she really loves you Thats the worst
part of it you both love each other The Duchess slowly nodded her
head You both love each other If it wasnt for that I wouldnt care
what you tried to do But I tell you again you cant change her Shes
too sure of herself Shell always try to make you go _her way_and if
you dont youll never get a smile from her And because you love each
other Im afraid youll give in and go her way Thats what Im afraid
of Wont you just cut her out of your life Larry

It had been a prodigiously long speech for the Duchess And Larry
realized that the emotion behind it was a thousand times what showed in
the thin voice of the bent gestureless figure

For your sake Im sorry grandmother But I cant

Then its only fair to tell you Larry she said in a more composed
tone which expressed a finality of decision that if theres ever
anything I can do to stop this Ill do it For shes bad for youwhat
with her stiff spiritand the ideas Old Jimmie has put into herand
the way Old Jimmie has brought her up Ill stop things if I can

Larry made no reply The Duchess continued looking at him steadily for
a long space He knew she was thinking and he was wondering what was
passing through that shrewd old brain when she remarked

By the way Larry I just remembered what you told me of that old Sing
Sing friendJoe Ellison Have you heard from him recently

Hes out and hes working where I am

Yes Whats he doing

Hes working there as a gardener

Again she was silent a space her sunken eyes steady With thought Then
she said

From the time he was twenty till he was thirty I knew Joe Ellison
wellbetter than Ive ever told you He knew your mother when she was
a girl Larry I wish youd ask him to come in to see me As soon as he
can manage it

Larry promised His grandmother said no more about Maggie and presently
Larry bade her goodnight and made his cautious way ever on the lookout
for danger to where he had left his roadster and thence safely out to
Cedar Crest But the Duchess sat for hours exactly as he had left her
her accounts unheeded thinking thinking thinking over an utterly
impossible possibility that had first presented itself faintly to her
several days before She did not see how the thing could be and yet
somehow it might be for many a strange thing did happen in this border
world where for so long she had lived When finally she went to bed she
slept little her busy conjectures would not permit sleep And though
the next day she went about her shop seemingly as usual she was still
thinking

That night Joe Ellison came They met as though they had last seen each
other but yesterday

Goodevening Joe

Glad to see you Duchess

She held out to him a box of the best cigars which she had bought
against his coming for she had remembered Joe Ellisons once fastidious
taste regarding tobacco He lit one and they fell into the easy silence
of old friends taking up their friendship exactly where it had been
broken off As a matter of fact Joe Ellison might have been her
soninlaw but for her own firm attitude He had known her daughter very
much better than her words to Larry the previous evening had indicated
Not only had Joe known her while a girl down here but much later he
had learned in what convent she was going to school and there had been
surreptitious lovemaking despite convent rules and boundariestill the
Duchess had learned what was going on She had had a square outandout
talk with Joe the romance had suddenly ended and later Larrys
mother had married elsewhere But the snuffedout romance had made
no difference in the friendship between the Duchess and Joe each had
recognized the other as square as that word was understood in their
border world

To Joe Ellison the Duchess was changed but little since twentyodd years
ago She had seemed old even then though as a youth he had known old
men who had talked of her beauty when a young woman and of how she
had queened it among the reckless spirits of that far time But to the
Duchess the change in Joe Ellison was astounding She had last seen
him in his middle thirties blackhaired handsome careful of dress
powerful of physique dominant fierytempered fearless of any living
thing but with these hot qualities checked into a surface appearance of
unruffled equanimity by his selfcontrol and his habitual reticence And
now to see him thin whitehaired bent his old fire seemingly burned
to gray ashesthe Duchess who had seen much in her generations was
almost appalled at the transformation

At first the Duchess skillfully guided the talk among commonplaces

Larry tells me youre out with him

Yes said Joe Larrys been a mighty good pal

Whatre you going to do when you get back your strength

The same as Im doing nowif theyll let me

And after a pause Perhaps later if I had the necessary capital Id
like to start a little nursery Or else grow flowers for the market

Not going back to the old thing then

Joe shook his white head Im all through there Flowers are a more
interesting proposition

Whenever you get ready to start Joe you can have all the capital
you want from me And it will cost you nothing Or if youd rather pay
itll cost you the same as at a banksix per cent

Thanks Ill remember Joe Ellison could not have spoken his gratitude
more strongly

The Duchess now carefully guided the talk in the direction of the thing
of which she had thought so constantly

By the way Joe Larry told me something about you Id never heard
beforethat you had been married and had a child

Yes You didnt hear because I wasnt telling anybody about it when it
happened and it never came out

Mind telling me about it Joe

He pulled at his perfecto while assembling his facts and then he
made one of the longest speeches Joe EllisonSilent Joe some of his
friends had called him in the old dayswas ever known to utter But
there was reason for its length it was an epitome of the most important
period of his life

I had a nice little country place over in Jersey for three or four
years It all happened there No one knew me for what I was they
took me for what I pretended to be a small capitalist whose interests
required his taking occasional trips Nice neighbors Thats where I met
my wife She was fine every way Thats why I kept all that part of
my life from my pals I was afraid they might leak and the truth would
spoil everything My wife was an orphan niece of the widow of a broker
who lived out there She never knew the truth about me She died when
the baby was born When the baby was a year and a half my big smash
came and I went up the river But I was never connected up with the man
who lived over in Jersey and who suddenly cancelled his lease and moved
away

The Duchess drew nearer to the heart of her thoughts

Was the baby a boy or girl Joe

Girl

The Duchess did not so much as blink How old would she be by this
time

Eighteen

What was her name

Maryafter her mother But of course I ordered it to be changed I
dont know what her name is now

The Duchess pressed closer

What became of her Joe

A glow began to come into the somber eyes of Joe Ellison I told you
her mother was a fine woman and she never knew anything bad about me I
wanted my girl to grow up like her mother I wanted her to have as good
a chance as any of those nice girls over in JerseyI wanted her never
to know any of the lot Ive knownI wanted her never to have the stain
of knowing her father was a crookI wanted her never to know even who
her father was

How did you manage it

Her mother had left a little fortune about twentyfive
thousandtwelve or fifteen hundred a year I turned the money and the
girl over to my best paland the squarest pal a man ever hadthe only
one Id let know about my Jersey life I told him what to do She was an
awfully bright little thing at a year and a half when I saw her last
she was already talking She was to be brought up among nice simple
peoplego to a good schoolgrow up to be a nice simple girl And
especially never to know anything about me She was to believe herself
an orphan And my pal did just as I ordered He wrote me how she was
getting on till about four years ago then I had news that he was dead
and that the trust fund had been transferred to a firm of lawyers
though I wasnt given the name of the lawyers That doesnt make any
difference since shes getting the money just the same

What was your pals name Joe

Jimmie Carlisle

The Duchess had been certain what this name would be but nevertheless
she could not repress a start

Whats the matter Joe asked sharply Did you know him

Not in those days said the Duchess recovering her even tone Though
I got to know him later By the way she added casually did Jimmie
Carlisle have any children of his own

Not before I went away He wasnt even married

There was now no slightest doubt left in the Duchesss mind Maggie was
really Joe Ellisons daughter

Joe Ellison went on the glow of his sunken eyes becoming yet more
exalted He was almost voicing his thoughts to himself alone for
his friendship with the Duchess was so old that her presence was no
inhibition His low words were almost identical in substance with what
Larry had tolda summary of what had come to be his one great hope and
dream the nearest thing he had to a religion

Somewhere in a nice place my girl is now growing up like her mother
Clean of everything I was and I knew She must be practically a woman
now I dont know where she istheres now no way for me to learn
And I dont want to know And I dont want her ever to know about me
I dont ever want to be the cause of making her feel disgraced or of
dragging her down from among the people where she belongs

The Duchess gave no visible sign of emotion but her ancient
heartstrings were set vibrating by that tense lowpitched voice She
had a momentary impulse to tell him the truth But just then the Duchess
was a confusion of many conflicting impulses and the balance of their
strength was for the moment against telling So she said nothing

Their talk drifted back to commonplaces and presently Joe Ellison
went away The Duchess sat motionless at her desk again
thinkingthinkingthinking and when Joe Ellison was back in his
gardeners cottage at Cedar Crest and was happily asleep she still sat
where he had left her During her generations of looking upon life from
the inside she had seen the truth of many strange situations of which
the world had learned only the wildest rumors or the most respectable
versions but during the long night hours perhaps because the affair
touched her so closely this seemed to her the strangest situation she
had ever known A father believing with the firm belief of established
certainty that his daughter had been brought up free from all taint of
his own life carefully bred among the best of people In reality the
girl brought up in a criminal atmosphere with criminal ideas implanted
in her as normal ideas and carefully trained in criminal ways and
ambitions And neither father nor daughter having a guess of the truth

Indeed it was a strange situation A situation charged with all kinds of
unforeseeable results

The Duchess now understood the unfatherly disregard Old Jimmie had shown
for the ordinary welfare of Maggie Not being her father he had not
cared Superficially at least Jimmie Carlisle must have been a much
more plausible individual twenty years earlier to have won the implicit
trust of Joe Ellison and to have become his foremost friend She
understood one reason why Old Jimmie had always boarded Maggie in
the cheapest and lowest places his hidden cupidity had thereby been
pocketing about a thousand dollars a year of trust money for over
sixteen years

But there was one queer problem here to which the Duchess could not at
this time see the answer If Jimmie Carlisle had wished to gratify his
cupidity and doublecross his friend why had he not at the very start
placed Maggie in an orphanage where she would have been neither charge
nor cost to him and thus have had the use of every penny of the trust
fund Why had he chosen to keep her by him and train her carefully to
be exactly what her father had most wished her not to be There must
have been some motive in the furtive tortuous mind of Old Jimmie that
now would perhaps forever remain a mystery

Of course she saw or thought she saw the reason for the report of Old
Jimmies death to Joe Ellison That report had been sent to escape an
accounting

As she sat through the night hours the Duchess for the first time felt
warmth creep over her for Maggie She saw Maggie in the light of a
victim If Maggie had been brought up as her father had planned she
might now be much the girl her father dreamed her But Old Jimmie had
entered the scheme of things Yes the audacious willful confident
Maggie bent on conquering the world in the way Old Jimmie and later
Barney Palmer had taught her was really just a poor misguided victim
who should have had a far different fate

And now the Duchess came to one of the greatest problems of her life
What should she do Considering the facts that Joe Ellison wished the
life of a recluse and desired to avoid all talk of the old days the
chances were that he would never happen upon the real state of affairs
Only she and Old Jimmie knew the essentials of the situationand very
likely Jimmie did not yet know that the friend who had once trusted him
was now a free man She felt as though she held in her hands the strings
of destiny Should she tell the truth

She pondered long All her considerations were given weight according to
what she saw as their possible effect upon Larry for Larry was the one
person left whom she loved and on him were fixed the aspirations of
these her final years Therefore her thoughts and arguments were myopic
almost necessarily specious She wanted to see justice done of course
But most of all she wanted what was best for Larry If she told the
truth it might result in some kind of temporary breakdown in Maggies
attitude which would bring her and Larry together That would be
disastrous If not disastrous at once certainly in the end Maggie was
a victim and undoubtedly deserved sympathy But others should not be
sacrificed merely because Maggie had suffered an injury She had been
too long under the tutelage of Old Jimmie and his teachings were
now too thoroughly the fiber of her very being for her to alter
permanently She might change temporarily under the urge of an emotional
revelation but she would surely revert to her present self There was
no doubt of that

And the Duchess gave weight to other considerationsall human yet all
in some measure specious Joe Ellison was happy in his dream and would
be happy in it all the rest of his life Why tell the truth and destroy
his precious illusionespecially when there was no chance to change
Maggie

And further she recalled the terrific temper that had lived within the
composed demeanor of Joe Ellison The fires of that temper could not yet
be all burned out If she told the truth told that Jimmie Carlisle was
still alive that might be just touching the trigger of a devastating
tragedymight be disaster for all What would be the use when no one
would have been benefited

And so in the wisdom of her old head and the entanglements of her old
heart the Duchess decided she would never tell And that loving human
decision she was to cling to through the stress of times to come

But even while she was thus deciding upon a measure to checkmate them
both Larry was pacing his room at Cedar Crest at last excitedly
evolving the elusive plan which was to bring Maggie to her senses and
also to him and Maggie all unconscious of this new element which had
entered as a potential factor in her existence all unconscious of how
far she had been guided from the course which had been charted for
her was lying awake at the Grantham after a late party at which Dick
Sherwood had been her escort and was exulting pridefully over the
seemingly near consummation of the plan that was to show Larry Brainard
how wrong he was and that was to establish her as the cleverest woman in
her linebetter even than Barney or Old Jimmie believed her

And thus separate wills each strove to direct their own lives and other
lives according to their own separate plans little thinking to what
extent they were all entangled in a common destiny and thinking not at
all of the further seed that was being sown for the harvesttime of the
whirlwind




CHAPTER XXII


After Larrys many days and nights of futile searching of his brain for
a plan that would accord with his fundamental idea for awakening the
unguessed other self of Maggie the plan which finally came to him
complete in all its details in a single moment was so simple and
obvious that he marveled it could have been plainly before his eyes all
this while without his ever seeing it Of course the plan was dangerous
and of doubtful issue It had to be so because it involved the
reactions of strongtempered persons as yet unacquainted who would
have no foreknowledge of the design behind their new relationship and
because its success or failure which might also mean his own complete
failure the complete loss of all he had thus far gained depended
largely upon the twist of events which he could not foresee and
therefore could not guide

Briefly his plan was so to manage as to have Maggie received in
the Sherwood household as a guest to have her receive the frank
unquestioning hospitality and perhaps friendship of such a gracious
highly placed unpretentious woman as Miss Sherwood so distinctly a
native of and not an immigrant to the great world To be received as
a friend by those against whom she plotted to have the generous
unsuspecting friendship of Miss Sherwoodif anything just then had a
chance to open the blinded Maggies eyes to the evil and error of what
she was engaged upon if anything had a chance to appeal to the finer
things he believed to exist unrecognized or suppressed in Maggie this
was that thing

And best part of this plan its effect would be only within Maggies
self No one need know that anything had happened There would be no
exposure no humiliation

Of course there was the great question of how to get Miss Sherwood to
invite Maggie and whether indeed Miss Sherwood would invite her at
all And there was the further question the invitation being sent of
whether Maggie would accept

Larry decided to manipulate his design through Dick Sherwood Late that
afternoon when Dick just returned from the city dropped into as was
his beforedinner custom the officestudy which had been set aside for
Larrys use Larry after an adroit approach to his subject continued

And since Ive been wished on you as a sort of stepuncle theres
something Id like to suggestif I dont seem to be fairly jimmying my
way into your affairs

Doors unlocked and wide open Captain said Dick Walk right in and
take the best chair

Thanks Remember telling me about a young woman you recently met A
Miss MaggieMaggie

Miss Cameron Dick prompted Of course I remember

And remember your telling me that this time its the real thing

And it IS the real thing

You haventexcuse measked her to marry you yet

No Ive been trying to get up my nerve

Heres where youve got to excuse me once more Dickits not my
business to tell you what should be your relations with your familybut
have you told your sister

No Dick hesitated I suppose I should But I hadnt thought of
ityet You see Again Dick hesitated

Yes prompted Larry

There are her relativesthat cousin and uncle I guess it must
have been my thinking of them that prevented my thinking of what you
suggest

But you told me they hadnt interfered much and never would
interfere Larry gently pressed his point And look at it from Miss
Camerons angle of view If its the real thing and youre behaving
that way toward her hasnt she good grounds for thinking it strange
that you havent introduced her to your family

By George youre right Captain Ill see to that at once

Of course Dick Larry went on carefully feeling his way you know
much better than I the proper way to do such thingsbut dont you think
it would be rather nice when you tell your sister that you suggest to
her that she invite Miss Cameron out here for a little visit If they
are to meet I know Miss Cameron or any girl would take it as more of
a tribute to be received in your own home than merely to meet in a big
commonplace hotel

Right again Captain Id tell Isabel tonight and ask her to send the
invitationonly Im booked to scoot right back to the city for a little
party as soon as I get some things together and Ill stay overnight in
the apartment But Ill attend to the thing tomorrow night sure

May I ask just one favor in the meantime

One favor A dozen Captain

Ill take the other eleven later Just now I only ask since you
havent proposed that you wontercommit yourself any further in
any way with Miss Cameron until after youve told your sister and until
after Miss Cameron has been out here

Oh I say now protested Dick

I am merely suggesting that affairs remain in statu quo until after
Miss Camerons visit with your sister Thats not asking much of you
Dicknor asking it for a very long time

Oh of course Ill do it Captain grumbled Dick affectionately
Youve got me where Ill do almost anything you want me to do

But Dick did not speak to his sister the following evening The next
morning news came to Miss Sherwood of a friends illness and she and
her novelreading aunt hurried off at once on what was to prove to be a
weeks absence But this delay in his plan did not worry Larry greatly
as it otherwise would have done for Dick repeated his promise to hold a
stiff rein upon himself until after he should have spoken to his sister
And Larry believed he could rely upon Dicks pledged word

During this week of waiting and necessary inactivity Larry concentrated
upon another phase of his manysided planto make of himself a business
success As has been said he saw his chance of this in the handling
of Miss Sherwoods affairs and saw it particularly in an idea that had
begun to grow upon him since he became aware through statements
and letters from the agents turned over to him of the extent of the
Sherwood realestate holdings and since he had got some glimmering of
their condition His previous venturings about the city had engendered
in him a sense of moderate security so he now began to make flying
trips into New York in the smart roadster Miss Sherwood had placed at
his disposal

On each trip Larry made swift visits to several of the properties until
finally he had covered the entire list Miss Sherwood had furnished him
through the agents His survey corroborated his surmise The property
mostly neglected apartment and tenement houses was in an almost equally
bad way whether one regarded it from the standpoint of sanitation
comfort or cold financial returns The fault for this was due to the
fact that the Sherwoods had left the property entirely in the care
of the agents and the agents being old oldfashioned and weary of
business to the point of being almost ready to retire had left the
property to itself

Prompted by these bad conditions and to some degree by the then
critical housing famine with its records of some thousands of families
having no place at all to go and some thousands of families being
compelled for the sake of mere shelter to pay two and three times
what they could afford for a few poor rooms and with its records of
profiteering landlords Larry began to make notes for a plan which
he intended later to elaboratea plan which he tentatively entitled
Suggestions for the Development of Sherwood RealEstate Holdings
Larry knowing from the stubs of Miss Sherwoods checkbook what would
be likely to please her gave as much consideration to Service as
to Profit The basis of his growing plan was good apartments at fair
rentals That he saw as the greatest of public services in the present
crisis But the return upon the investment had to be a reasonable one
Larry did not believe in Charity except for extreme cases He believed
and his belief had grown out of a wide experience with many kinds of
people that Charity of course to a smaller extent was as definitely a
source of social evil as the then muchtalkedof Profiteering

In the meantime he was seeing his old friend Joe Ellison every day
perhaps smoking with Ellison in his cottage after he had finished his
days work among the roses perhaps walking along the bluff which
hung above the Sound whose cool clear waters splashed with vacation
laziness upon the shingle The two men rarely spoke and never of the
past Larry was well acquainted with and understood the older mans
deeprooted wish to avoid all talk bearing upon deeds and associates of
other days that was a part of his life and a phase of existence that
Joe Ellison was trying to forget and Larry by his silence deferred to
his friends desire

On the day after Joe Ellisons visit to the Duchess Larry had received
a note from his grandmother addressed of course to Mr Brandon
There was no danger in her writing Larry if she took adequate
precautions mail addressed to Cedar Crest was not bothered by postal
and police officials it was only mail which came to the house of the
Duchess which received the attention of these gentlemen

The note was one which the Duchess after that night of thought which
had so shaken her old heart had decided to be a necessity if her plan
of never telling of her discovery of Maggies real paternity were to be
a success The major portion of her note dwelt upon a generality with
which Larry already was acquainted Joes desire to keep clear of all
talk touching upon the deeds and the people of his past And then in
a carelessseeming last sentence the Duchess packed the carefully
calculated substance of her entire note

It may not be very importantbut particularly avoid ever mentioning
the mere name of Jimmie Carlisle They used to know each other and
their acquaintance is about the bitterest thing Joe Ellison has to
remember

Of course hed never mention Old Jimmie Carlisle Larry said to himself
as he destroyed the notenever guessing in making this natural
response to what seemed a most natural request that he had become an
unconscious partner in the plan of the warmhearted scheming Duchess

There was one detail of Joe Ellisons behavior which aroused Larrys
mild curiosity Directly beneath one of Joes gardens hardly a hundred
yards away was a bit of beach and a pavilion which were used in common
by the families from the surrounding estates The girls and younger
women were just home from schools and colleges and at high tide were
always on the beach At this period whenever he was at Cedar Crest
Larry saw Joe his work apparently forgotten gazing fixedly down
upon the young figures splashing about the water in their bright
bathingsuits or lounging about the pavilion in their smart summer
frocks

This interest made Larry wonder though to be sure not very seriously
For he had never a guess of how deep Joes interest was He did not
know could not know that that tall fixed figure with its one
absorbing idea was thinking of his daughter He could not know that Joe
Ellison emotionally elated and with a hungry selfdenying affection
that reached out toward them all was seeing his daughter as just such
a girl as one of thesesimple wholesome wellbroughtup He could
not know that Joe in a way perceived his daughter in every nice young
woman he saw

Toward evening of the seventh day of her visit Miss Sherwood returned
Larry was on the piazza when the car bearing her swept into the
whitegraveled curve of the drive The car was a handsome powerful
roadster Larry had started out to be of such assistance as he could
when the figure at the wheel a man sprang from the car and helped
Miss Sherwood alight Larry saw that the man was Huntsuch a different
Huntand he had begun a quick retreat when Hunts voice called after
him

You therewait a minute I want a little chinchin with you

Larry halted He could not help overhearing the few words that passed
between Hunt and Miss Sherwood

Thank you ever so much she said in her even voice Then youre
coming

I promised didnt I

Then goodbye

Goodbye

They shook hands friendly enough but rather formally and Miss Sherwood
turned to the house Hunt called to Larry

Come here son

Larry crossed to the big painter who was standing beside the
powerbulged hood of his lowswung car

Happened to drop in where she wasbrought her homeaunt following
in that hearse with its fivefoot cushions she always rides in
Hunt explained And then Well I suppose youve got to give me the
onceover Hurry up and get it done with

Larry obeyed Hunts wild hair had been smartly barbered he had on a
swagger dustcoat and beneath it flannels of the smartest cut Further
he bore himself as if smart clothes and smart cars had always been items
of his equipment

Well young fellow spill it he commanded What do I look like

Like Solomon in all his glory No more like the hedressmaker of the
Queen of Sheba

Im going to run you up every telephone post we come to for that
insult Hop in son and well take a little voyage around the earth in
eighty seconds

Larry got in Once out of the drive the car leaped away as though intent
upon keeping to Hunts timetable But after a mile or two Hunt quieted
the roaring monster to a conversational pace

Get one of the invitations to my show he asked

Yes Several days ago That dealer certainly got it up in great shape

You must have hypnotized Graham That old paint pirate is giving the
engine all the gas shell standand believe me hes sure getting up
a lot of speed Hunt grinned That private preexhibition show you
suggested is proving the best publicity idea Graham ever had in his
musty old shop Everywhere I go people are talking about the darned
thing Every man woman and child also unmarried females of both sexes
who got invitations are comingand those who didnt get em are trying
to bribe the traffic cop at FortySecond Street to let em in

Hunt paused for a chuckle And Im having the time of my young life
with the people who always thought I couldnt paint and who are now
trying to sidle up to me on the suspicion that possibly after all I can
paint Whats got that bunch buffaloed is the fact that Graham has let
it leak out that Im likely to make bales of money from my painting The
idea of any one making money out of painting thats too much for their
heads Oh this is the life Larry

Larry started to congratulate him but was instantly interrupted with

I admit Im a painter and always will admit it But this present thing
is all your doing Well try to square things sometime But I didnt ask
you to come along to hear verbostical acrobatics about myself I asked
you to learn if youd worked out your plan yet regarding Maggie

Yes And Larry proceeded to give the details of his design

Regular psychological stuff exclaimed Hunt And then Say youre
some stagemanager Or rather same playwright Playwrights that know
tell me its one of their most difficult tricksto get all their
leading characters on the stage at the same time And here youve got
it all fixed to bring on Miss Sherwood Dick Maggie yourself and
the allimportant mefor dont forget I shall be slipping out to Cedar
Crest occasionally

As for myself remarked Larry I shall remain very much behind the
scenes Maggiell never see me

Well heres hoping youre good enough playwright to manage your
characters so they wont run away from you and mix up an ending you
never dreamed of

The car paused again in the drive and Larry got out

I say Larry Hunt whispered eagerly whos that tall whitehaired
man working over there among the roses

Joe Ellison Hes that man I told you about my getting to know in Sing
Sing Remember

Oh yes The crook who was having his baby brought up to be a real
person Say hes a sureenough character Lordy but Id love to paint
that face Solong son

The car swung around the drive and roared away Larry mounted to the
piazza Dick was waiting for him and excitedly drew him down to one
corner that crimson ramblers had woven into a nook for confidences

Captain old scout he said in a low happy voice Ive just told
sis Put the whole proposition up to her just as you told me She
took it like a regular fellow Your whole idea was one hundred per cent
right Sis is inside now getting off that invitation to Miss Cameron
asking her to come out day after tomorrow

Larry involuntarily caught the veranda railing I hope it works
outfor the best he said

Oh it willno doubt of it cried the exultant Dick And Captain
if it does itll be all your doing




CHAPTER XXIII


When Miss Sherwoods invitation reached Maggie Barney and Old Jimmie
were with her The pair had growled a lot though not directly at
Maggie at the seeming lack of progress Maggie had made during the past
week Barney was a firm enough believer in his rogues creed of first
getting your fish securely hooked but on the other hand there was the
danger if the hooked fish be allowed to remain too long in the water
that it would disastrously shake itself free of the barb and swim away
That was what Barney was afraid had been happening with Dick Sherwood
Therefore he was thinking of returning to his abandoned scheme of
selling stock to Dick He might get Dicks money in that way though of
course not so much money and of course not so safely

And another item which for some time had not been pleasing Barney was
that Larry Brainard had not yet been finally taken care of either by
the police or by that unofficial force to which he had given orders
So he had good reason for permitting himself the relaxation of scowling
when he was not on public exhibition

But when Maggie after reading the invitation tossed it together with
a note from Dick across to Barney without comment the color of his
entire world changed for that favorite son of Broadway The surly
gloom of the end of a profitless enterprise became magically an aurora
borealis of superior hopesno something infinitely more substantial
than any heavenpainting flare of iridescent colors

Maggie its the real thing At last he cried

What is it asked Old Jimmie

Barney gave him the letter Jimmie read it through then handed it back
slowly shaking his head

I dont see nothing to get excited about said the everdoubtful
everhesitant Jimmie Its only an invitation

Aw hell ejaculated the exasperated Barney in disgust If some one
handed you a government bond all you could see would be a cigar coupon
That invitation together with this note from Dick Sherwood saying hell
call and take Maggie out means that the fish is all ready to be landed
Try to come back to life Jimmie If you knew anything at all about
bigleague society youd know that sending invitations to meet the
familythats the way these swells do things when theyre all set to do
business Were all ready for the killingthe big cleanup

He turned to Maggie Great stuff Maggie I knew you could put it over
Of course youre going

Of course replied Maggie with a composure which was wholly of her
manner

A sudden doubt came out of this glory to becloud Barneys master mind
I dont know he said slowly Its one proposition to make one
of these men swells believe that a woman is the real thing And its
another proposition to put it over on one of these women swells Theyve
got eyes for every little detail and they know the difference between
the genuine article and an imitation Ive heard a lot about this Miss
Sherwood they say shes one of the cleverest of the swells Think you
can walk into her house and put it over on her Maggie

Of coursewhy not answered Maggie again with that composure which
was prompted by her prides desire to make Barney and every one else
believe her equal to any situation

Barneys animation returned All right If you think you can swing it
you can swing it and the jobs the same as finished and were made

Left to herself and the imposing propriety and magnificent stupidity
of Miss Grierson Maggie made no attempt to keep up her appearance of
confidence All her thoughts were upon this opportunity which
insisted upon looking to her like a menace She tried to whip her
selfconfidence of which she was so proud into a condition of constant
pregnancy But the plain fact was that Maggie the misguided child of a
stolen birthright whose soaring spirit was striving so hard to live up
to the traditions and conventions of cynicism whose young ambition it
was to outshine and surpass all possible competitors in this world in
which she had been placed who in her pride believed she knew so much of
lifethe plain fact was that Maggie was in a state bordering on funk

This invitation from Miss Sherwood was an ordeal she had never counted
on She had watched the fine ladies at the millinery shop and while
selling cigarettes at the Ritzmore when she had been modeling her
manners and had believed herself just as fine a lady as they But that
had been in the abstract Now she was face to face with a situation that
was painfully concretea real test she had to place herself into close
contrast with and under the close observation of a real lady and in
that ladys own home And in all her life she had not once been in a
fine home In fine hotels yesbut fine hotels were the common
refuge of butcher baker floorwalker thief swell and each had
approximately the same attention and all she now felt she had really
learned were a few such matters as the use of table silver and finger
bowls

It came to her that Barney in his moment of doubt had spoken more
soundly than he had imagined when he had said that it was easier to fool
a man about a woman than it was to fool a woman How tragically true
that was While trying to learn to be a lady by working in smart shops
she had learned that the occasional man who had ventured in after
womans gear was hopelessly ignorant and bought whatever was skillfully
thrust upon him but that it was impossible to slip an inferior or
unsuitable or outdated article over on the woman who really knew

And Miss Sherwood was the kind of woman who really knew Who knew
everything Could she possibly possibly pass herself off on Miss
Sherwood as the genuine article

Could Larry have foreseen the very real miseryfor any doubt of her
own qualities any fear of her ability to carry herself well in any
situation are among the most acute of a proud womans miserieswhich
for some twentyfour hours was brought upon Maggie by the wellmeant
intrigue of which he was pulling the hidden strings he might because
of his love for Maggie have discarded his design even while he was
creating it and have sought a measure pregnant with less distress But
perhaps it was just as well that Larry did not know Perhaps even it
was just as well that he did not know what his grandmother knew

Maggies pride would not let her evade the risk and her instinct
for selfpreservation dictated that she should reduce the risk to its
minimum So she wrote her acceptanceMiss Grierson attended to the
phrasing of her notebut expressed her regret that she would be able to
come only for the teahour Drinking tea must be much the same reasoned
Maggie whether it be drunk in a smart hotel or in a smart country home

Maggies native shrewdness suggested her simplest summer gown as likely
to have committed the fewest errors and the invaluable stupidity of
Miss Grierson aided her toward correctness if not originality When
Dick came he was delighted with her appearance On the way out he
was ebulliently excited in his talk Maggie averaged a fair degree of
sensibility in her responses though only her ears heard him She was
far more excited than he and every moment her excitement mounted for
every moment she was speeding nearer the greatest ordeal of her life

When at length they curved through the lawns of satin smoothness and
Dick slowed down the car before the long white house splendid in its
simplicity Maggies excitement had added unto it a palpitant chilling
awe And unto this was added consternation when as they mounted the
steps Miss Sherwood smilingly crossed the piazza and welcomed her
without waiting for an introduction Maggie mumbled some reply she
later could not remember what it was Indeed she never had met such a
woman so finished so gracious so unaffected with a sparkle of humor
in her brown eyes and the rich plainness of her white linen frock
made Maggie conscious that her own supposed simplicity was cheap and
ostentatious If Miss Sherwood had received her with hostility doubt
or even chilled civility the situation would have been easier the
aroused Maggie would then have made use of her own great endowment of
hauteur and selfesteem But to be received with this frank cordiality
on a basis of a equality with this finished womanthat left Maggie for
the moment without arms She had in her high moments believed herself
an adventuress whose poise and plans nothing could unbalance Now she
found herself suddenly just a young girl of eighteen who didnt know
what to do

Had Maggie but known it that sudden unconscious confusion which seemed
to betray her was really more effective for her purpose than would
have been the best of conscious acting It established her at once as an
unstagey ingenuesimple unspoiled unacquainted with the formulas and
formalities of the world

Miss Sherwood in her easy possession of the situation banished Dick
with Run away for a while Dick and give us two women a chance to get
acquainted She had caught Maggies embarrassment and led her to
a corner of the veranda which looked down upon the gardens and the
glistering Sound She spoke of the impersonal beauties spread before
their vision until she judged that Maggies first flutter had abated
then she led the way to wicker chairs beside a table where obviously tea
was to be spread

Miss Sherwood accepted Maggie for exactly what she seemed to be and
presently she was saying in a low voice with her smiling unoffending
directness

Excuse the liberty of an older woman Miss Cameronbut I dont wonder
that Dick likes you You see hes told me

If Maggie had been at loss for her cue before she had it now It was
unpretentiousness

But Miss SherwoodIm so crude she faltered acting her best Out
West I never had any chances to learn Not any chances like your Eastern
girls

Thats no difference my dear You are a nice simple girlthats what
counts

Thank you said Maggie

So few of our rich girls of the East know what it is to be simple
continued Miss Sherwood Too many are all affectation and pose and
forwardness At twenty they know all there is to be known they are
blaseescynicalready for divorce before they are ready for marriage
By contrast you are so wholesome so refreshing

Thank you Maggie again murmured

And as the two women sat there sprung from the extremes of life but
for the moment on the level of equals and as the older talked on there
grew up in Maggie two violently contradictory emotions One was triumph
She had won out here just as she had said she would win out and won
out with what Barney had declared to be the most difficult person to get
the better of a finished woman of the world Indeed that was triumph

The other emotion she did not understand so well And just then
she could not analyze it It was an unexpected dismaya vague but
permeating sicknessa dazed sense that she was being carried by
unfamiliar forces toward she knew not what

She held fast to her sense of triumph That was the more apprehendable
and positive triumph was what she had set forth to win This sense of
triumph was at its highest and she was resting in its elating security
when a car stopped before the house and a large man got out and started
up the steps From the first moment there was something familiar to
Maggie in his carriage but not till Miss Sherwood who had risen and
crossed toward him greeted him as Mr Hunt did Maggie recognize the
welldressed visitor as the shabby boisterous painter whom she had last
seen down at the Duchesss

Panic seized upon her Miss Sherwood was leading him toward where she
sat and his first clear sight of her would mean the end There was
no possible escape she could only await her fate And when she was
denounced as a fraud and her glittering victory was gone she could
only take herself away with as much of the defiance of admitted defeat
as she could assumeand that wouldnt be much

She gazed up at Hunt whitely awaiting extermination Miss Sherwoods
voice came to her from an infinite distance introducing them Hunt
bowed with a formally polite smile and said formally Im very glad
to meet you Miss Cameron

Not till he and Miss Sherwood were seated and chatting did Maggie
realize the fullness of the astounding fact that he had not recognized
her This was far more upsetting to her than would have been recognition
and exposure she had been all braced for that but not for what had
actually happened She was certain he must have known her nothing had
really changed about her except her dress and only a few weeks had
passed since he had been seeing her daily down at the Duchesss
and since she had been his model and he had studied every line and
expression of her face with those sharp painters eyes of his

And so as the two chatted she putting in a stumbling phrase when they
turned to her Maggie Carlisle Maggie Cameron Maggie Ellison that
gallant and allconfident adventuress who till the present had never
admitted herself seriously disturbed by a problem sat limply in her
chair a very young girl indeed and wondered how this thing could
possibly be




CHAPTER XXIV


Presently Miss Sherwood said something about tea excused herself and
disappeared within the house Maggie saw that Hunt watched Miss Sherwood
till she was safely within doors then she was aware that he was gazing
steadily at her then she saw him execute a slow solemn wink

Maggie almost sprang from her chair

Shall we take a little stroll Miss Cameron Hunt asked I think it
will be some time before Miss Sherwood will want us for tea

Yesthank you Maggie stammered

Hunt led her down a walk of white gravel to where a circle of Hiawatha
roses were trained into a graceful mosque now daintily glorious with
its solid covering of yellowhearted red blooms Within this retreat was
a rustic bench and on this Hunt seated her and took a place beside her
He looked her over with the cool direct studious eyes which reminded
her of his gaze when he had been painting her

Well Maggie he finally commented you certainly look the part you
picked out for yourself and you seem to be putting it over Always had
an idea you could handle something big if you went after it How dyou
like the life being a swell lady crook


She had hardly heard his banter She needed to ask him no questions
about his presence here his ease of bearing had conveyed to her
unconsciously from the first instant that her previous halfcontemptuous
estimate of him had been altogether wrong and that he was now in his
natural element Her first question went straight to the cause of her
amazement

Didnt you recognize me when you first saw me with Miss Sherwood

Yes

Werent you surprised

Nope he answered with deliberate monosyllabioness

Why not

Id been wised up that Id be likely to meet youand here

Here By whom

By advice of counsel I must decline to answer

Why didnt you tell Miss Sherwood who I am and show me up

Because Id been requested not to tell

Requested by whom

Maggie he drawled you seem to be making a go of this lady crook
businessbut I think you might have been even more of a shining light
as a criminal crossexaminer However I refuse to be crossexamined
further By the way he drawled on how goes it with those dear souls
Barney and Old Jimmie

She ignored his question

Please Who asked you not to tell

There was a sudden glint of goodhumored malice in his eyes Mind if I
smoke

No

He drew out a silver cigarette case and opened it Empty he
exclaimed Excuse me while I get something from the house to smoke
Ill be right back

Without waiting for her permission he stepped out of the arbor and she
heard his footsteps crunching up the gravel path Maggie waited his
return in pulsing suspense Her situation had been developing beyond
anything she had ever dreamed of she was aquiver as to what might
happen next So absorbed was she in her chaos of feeling and thoughts
that she did not even hear the humble symphony of the hundreds of bees
drawing their treasure from the golden hearts of the roses and did
not see across the path a score of yards away the tall figure of Joe
Ellison among the rosebushes pruningshears in hand with which he
had been cutting out dead blossoms gazing at her with that hungry
admiring speculative look with which he had regarded the young women
upon the beach

Presently she heard Hunts footsteps coming down the path Then she
detected a second pair Dick accompanying him she thought And then
Hunt appeared before her and was saying in his big voice Miss
Cameron permit me to present my friend Mr Brandon And then he added
in a lowered voice grinning with the impish delight of an overgrown boy
who is playing a trick Thought Id better go through the motions of
introducing you people so it would look as if youd just met for the
first time And with that he was gone

Maggie had risen galvanically For the moment she could only stare Then
she got out his name

Larry she whispered You here

Yes

Astounded as she was she had caught instantly the total lack of
amazement on Larrys part

Youreyoure not surprised to see me

No he said evenly I knew you were here And before that I knew you
were coming

That was almost too much for Maggie Hunt had known and Larry had known
both were people belonging to her old life both the last people
she expected to meet in such circumstances She could only stare at
himentirely taken aback by this meeting

And indeed it was a strangely different meeting from the last time she
had seen him at the Grantham strangely different from those earlier
meetings down at the Duchesss when both had been grubs as yet
unmetamorphosized Now standing in the arbor they looked a pair of
weekend guests in keeping with the place For as Maggie had noted
Larry in his wellcut flannels was as greatly transformed as Hunt

It was Larry who ended the silence Shall we sit down

She mechanically sank to the bench still staring at him

What are you doing here she managed to breathe

I belong here

Belong here

I work here he explained Im called Mr Brandon but Miss
Sherwood knows exactly who I am and what Ive been

How long have you been here

Since that night when Barney and Old Jimmie took you away to begin your
new careerthe same night that I ran away from those gunmen who thought
I was a squealer and from Casey and Gavegan

And all the while that Barney and my father and the police have thought
you hiding some place in the West youve been with the Sherwoods

Yes And Ive got to remain in hiding until something happens that will
clear me If the police or Barney and his friends learn where I amyou
can guess what will happen

She nodded

Hunt got me here he went on to explain Im assisting in trying to
get the Sherwood business affairs in better shape I might as well tell
you Maggie he added quietly that Dick Sherwood is my very good
friend

Dick Sherwood she breathed

And I might as well tell you he went on that since that night at
the Grantham when I heard his voice Ive known that Dick is the sucker
you and Barney and Old Jimmie are trying to trim

She half rose and her voice sounded sharply Then youve got me caught
in a trap Youve told them about me

No

Why not

Not so loud or we may attract attention he warned her I havent
told because you had your chance to give me away to Barney that night at
the Grantham And you didnt give me away

She sank slowly back to the bench Is that your only reason

No he answered truthfully Exposing you would merely mean that youd
feel harder toward meand harder toward every one else I dont want
that

She pondered this a moment Thenyoure not going to tell

He shook his head I dont expect to I want you to be free to decide
what youre going to dothough I hope youll decide not to go through
with this thing youre doing

She made no response Larry had spoken with control until now but his
next words burst from him

Dont you see what a situation its put me in Maggietrying to play
square with my friends the Sherwoods and trying to play square with
you

Again she did not answer

Maggie youre too good for what youre doingits all a terrible
mistake he cried passionately Then he remembered himself and spoke
with more composure Oh I know theres not much use in talking to you
nowwhile you feel as you do about yourselfand while you feel as you
do about me But you know I love you and want to marry youwhen He
halted

When she prompted almost involuntarily

When you see things differentlyand when I can go around the world a
free man not a fugitive from Barney and his gunmen and the police

Again Maggie was silent for a moment It was as if she were trying to
press out of her mind what he had said about loving her Truly this was
indeed different from their previous meetings Before there had almost
invariably been a defiant attitude a dispute a quarrel Now she had no
desire to quarrel

Finally she said with an effort to be that selfcontrolled person which
she had established as her model

You seem to have your chance here to put over what you boasted to me
about You remember making good in a straight way

Yes And I shall make goodif only they will let me alone He paused
an instant But I have no illusions about the present he went on
quietly Im in quiet water for a time Ive got a period of safety
and Im using this chance to put in some hard work But presently the
police and Barney and the others will learn where I am Then Ill have
all that fight over againonly the next time itll be harder

She was startled into a show of interest You think thats really going
to happen

Its bound to Theres no escaping it If for no other reason I myself
wont be able to stand being penned up indefinitely Something will
happen I dont know what which will pull me out into the open
worldand then for me the deluge

He made this prediction grimly He was not a fatalist but it had been
borne in upon him recently that this thing was inescapable As for him
when that time came he was going to put up the best fight that was in
him

He caught the strained look which had come into Maggies face and it
prompted him suddenly to lean toward her and say

Maggie do you still think Im a stool and a squealer

I

She broke off She had a surging impulse to go on and say something to
Larry A great deal She was not conscious of what that great deal was
She was conscious only of the impulse There was too great a turmoil
within her begotten by the strain of her visit on Miss Sherwood and
these unexpected meetings for any motive impulse or decision to
emerge to even a brief supremacy And so during this period when her
brain would not operate she let herself be swept on by the momentum of
the forces which had previously determined her directionher pride her
selfconfidence her ambition the alliance of fortune between her and
Barney and Old Jimmie

They were sitting in this silence when footsteps again sounded on the
gravel and a shadow blotted the arbor floor

Excuse me Larry said a mans voice

Sure What is it Joe

Before her Maggie saw the tall thin man in overalls his removed
broadbrimmed hat revealing his white hair whom she had noticed
a little earlier working among the flowers He held a bunch of the
choicest pickings from the abundant rose gardens their stems bound in
maple leaves as temporary protection against their thorns He was gazing
at Maggie respectful hungry admiration in his somber eyes

I thought perhaps the young lady might care for these He held out the
roses to her And then quickly to forestall refusal I cut out more
than we can use for the house And Id like to have you have them

Thank you and Maggie took the flowers

For an instant their eyes held In every outward circumstance the event
was a commonplacethis meeting of father and daughter not knowing each
other It was hardly more than a commonplace to Maggie just a tall
whitehaired gardener respectfully offering her roses And it was hardly
more to Joe Ellison just a tribute evoked by his hungry interest in
every wellseeming girl of the approximate age of his daughter

At the moments end Joe Ellison had bowed and started back for his
flower beds Who is that man asked Maggie gazing after him I never
saw such eyes

We used to be pals in Sing Sing Larry replied He went on to give
briefly some of the details of Joe Ellisons story never dreaming how
he and Maggie were entangled in that story nor how they were to be
involved in its untanglement Perhaps they were fortunate in this
ignorance Within the boundaries of what they did know life already held
enough of problems and complications

Larry had just finished his condensed history when Dick Sherwood
appeared and ordered them to the veranda for tea There were just
the five of them Miss Sherwood Maggie Hunt Dick and Larry Miss
Sherwood was as gracious as before and she seemingly took Maggies
strained manner and occasional confusions as further proof of her
genuineness Dick beamed at the impression she was making upon his
sister

As for Maggie she was living through the climax of that afternoons
strain And she dared not show it She forced herself to do her best
acting sipping her tea with a steady hand And what made her situation
harder was that two of the party Larry and Hunt were treating her with
the charmed deference they might accord a charming stranger when a word
from either of them might destroy the fragile edifice of her deception

At last it was over and all was ready for her to start back to town
with Dick When Miss Sherwood kissed her and warmly begged her to come
again soon the very last of her control seemed to be slipping from
herbut she held on Larry and Hunt she managed to say goodbye to in
the manner of her new acquaintanceship

Isnt she simply splendid exclaimed Miss Sherwood when Dick had
stepped into the car and the two had started away

Larry pretended not to have heard He felt precariously guilty toward
this woman who had befriended him The next instant he had forgotten
Miss Sherwood and his pulsing thoughts were all on Maggie in that
speeding car She had been profoundly shaken by that afternoons
experience this much he knew But what was going to be the real effect
upon her of his carefully thoughtout design Was it going to be such as
to save her and Dickand eventually win her for himself

In the presence of Miss Sherwood Larry tried to behave as if nothing
had happened more than the pleasant interruption of an informal tea but
beneath that calm all his senses were waiting breathless so to speak
for news of what had happened within Maggie and what might be happening
to her




CHAPTER XXV


When Maggie sped away from Cedar Crest in the low seat of the roadster
beside the happy Dick she felt herself more of a criminal than at any
time in her life and a criminal that miraculously was making her escape
out of an inescapable set of circumstances

Beyond her relief at this escape she did not know these first few
minutes what she thought or felt Too much had happened and what had
happened had all turned out so differently from what she had expected
for her to set in orderly array this chaos of reactions within herself
and read the meaning of that afternoons visit She managed with a
great effort to keep under control the outer extremities of her senses
and thus respond with the correct yes or no or indeed when some
response from her was required by Dicks happy conversation

Near Roslyn they swung off the turnpike into an unfrequented shady
road Dick steered to one side beneath a locusttree and silenced the
motor

Why are you stopping she asked in sudden alarm

So we can talk without a piece of impertinent machinery roaring
interruptions at us replied Dick with forced lightness And then in
a voice he could not make light I want to talk to you aboutabout my
sister Isnt she splendid

She is There was no wavering of her thoughts as Maggie emphatically
said this

Im mighty glad you like her She certainly liked you Shes all the
family Ive got and since you two hit it off so well together I hopeI
hope Maggie

And then Dick plunged into it stammeringly but earnestly He told
her how much he loved her in old phrases that his boyish ardor made
vibrantly new He loved her And if she would marry him her influence
would make him take the brace all his friends had urged upon him Shed
make him a man And she could see how pleased it would make his sister
And he would do his best to make Maggie happyhis very best

The young superadventuressshe herself had mentally used the word
adventuress in thinking of herself as being more genteel and mentally
aristocratic than the cruder words by which Barney and Old Jimmie and
their kind designated a woman accomplicethis young superadventuress
who had schemed all this so adroitly and worked toward it with the best
of her brain and her conscious charm was seized with new panic as she
listened to the eager torrent of his imploring words as she gazed into
the quivering earnestness of his frank blueeyed face She wished
she could get out of the machine and run away or sink through the
floorboards of the car For she really liked Dick

ImIm not so good as you think she whispered And then some
unsuspected force within her impelled her to say Dick if you knew the
truth

He caught her shoulders I know all the truth about you I want to know
Youre wonderful and I love you Will you marry me Answer that Thats
all I want to know

He had checked the confession that impulsively had surged toward her
lips Silent her eyes wide her breath coming sharply she sat gazing
at him And then from out the portion of her brain where were stored
her purposes and the momentum of her pride and determination there
flashed the realization that she had won The thing that Barney and Old
Jimmie had prepared and she had so skillfully worked toward was at last
achieved She had only to say yes and either of those two plans which
Barney had outlined could at once be put in operationand there could
be no doubt of the swift success of either Dicks eager trusting face
was guarantee that there would come no obstruction from him

She felt that in some strange way she had been caught in a trap Yes
what they had worked for they had won And yet in this moment of
winning as elements of her vast dizziness Maggie felt sick and
ashamedfelt a frenzied desire to run away from the whole affair For
Maggie cynical allconfident and eighteen was proving really a very
poor adventuress

Please Maggiehis imploring voice broke in upon herwont you
answer me You like me dont youyoull marry me wont you

I like you Dick she choked outand it was some slight comfort to
her to be telling this much of the truthbutbut I cant marry you

Maggie It was a cry of surprised pain and the pain in his voice
shot acutely into her From the way you acted toward meI thoughtI
hoped He sharply halted the accusation which had risen to his lips
Im not going to take that answer as final Maggie he said doggedly
Im going to give you more time to think it overmore time for me to
try Then Ill ask you again

That which prompted Maggies response was a mixture of impulses the
desire and this offered opportunity to escape and a faint reassertion
of the momentum of her purpose For with one such as Maggie the set
purposes may be seemingly overwhelmed but death comes hard

All right she breathed rapidly Only please get me back as quickly
as you can Im to have dinner with mymy cousin and Ill be very
late

Dick drove her into the city in almost unbroken silence and left her at
the great doors of the Grantham abustle with a dozen lackeys in purple
livery She stood a moment and watched him drive away He really was a
nice boyDick

As she shot up the elevator she thought of a hitherto forgotten element
of that afternoons bewildering situation Barney Palmer And Barney
was she knew now up in her sittingroom impatiently waiting for her
report of what he had good reason to believe would prove a successful
experience If she told the truththat Dick had proposed just as they
had planned for him to doand she had refused himwhy Barney

She seemed caught on every side

Maggie got into her suite by way of her bedroom She wanted time to
gather her wits for meeting Barney When Miss Grierson told her that
her cousin was still waiting to take her to dinner she requested her
companion to inform Barney that she would be in as soon as she had
dressed She wasted all the time she legitimately could in changing into
a dinnergown and when at length she stepped into her sittingroom she
was to Barneys eye the same cool Maggie as always

Barney rose as she entered He was in smart dinner jacket these days
Barney was wearing the smartest of everything that money could secure
There was a shadow of impatience on his face but it was instantly
dissipated by Maggies selfcomposed directeyed beauty

Howd you come out with Miss Sherwood he whispered eagerly

Well enough for her to kiss me goodbye and beg me to come again

Ive got to hand it to you Maggie Youre sure some swell
actressyouve sure got class His dark eyes gleamed on her with half
a dozen pleasures admiration of what she was in herselfadmiration
of what she had just achievedanticipation of results many
resultsanticipation of what she was later to mean to him in a personal
way If you can put it over on a swell like Miss Sherwood you can put
it over on any one He exulted As soon as we clean up this job in
hand well move on to one big thing after another

And then out came the question Maggie had been bracing herself for How
about Dick Sherwood Did he finally come across with that proposal

No Maggie answered steadily

No Why not exclaimed Barney sharply I thought that was all that
was holding him backwaiting for his sister to look you over and give
you her OK

Maggie had decided that her air of cool indifferent certainty was the
best manner to use in this situation with Barney So she shrugged her
white shoulders

How can I tell what makes a man do something and what makes him not do
it

But did he seem any less interested in you than before Barney
pursued

No replied Maggie

Then maybe hes just waiting to get up his nerve Hell ask you all
right nothing there for us to worry about Come on lets have dinner
Im starved

On the roof of the Grantham they were excellently served for Barney
knew how to order a dinner and he knew the art which is an alchemistic
mixture of suave diplomacy and the insinuated power and purpose of
murder of handling headwaiters and their subautocrats Having no
other business in hand Barney devoted himself to that business which
ran like a core through all his businessespaying court to Maggie And
when Barney wished to be a courtier there were few of his class who
could give a better superficial interpretation of the role and in this
particular instance he was at the advantage of being in earnest He
forced the most expensive tidbits announced by the dinner card upon
Maggie he gallantly and very gracefully put on and removed as required
by circumstances the green cobweb of a scarf Maggie had brought to
the roof as protection against the elements and when he took the
dancingfloor with her he swung her about and hopped up and down
and stepped in and out with all the skill of a master of the modern
perversion of dancing Barney was really good enough to have been a
professional dancer had his desires not led him toward what seemed to
him a more exciting and more profitable career

Maggie not to rouse Barneys suspicions played her role as well as he
did his own And most of the other diners a fraction of the changing
two or three hundred thousand people from the South and West who choose
New York as the best of all summer resorts gazed upon this handsome
couple with their intricate steps which were timed with such effortless
and enviable accuracy and excitedly believed that they were beholding
two distinguished specimens of what their home papers persisted in
calling New Yorks Four Hundred

Maggie got back to her room with the feeling that she had staved off
Barney and her numerous other dilemmas for the immediate present Her
chief thought in the many events of the day had been only to escape her
dangers and difficulties for the moment all the time she had known that
her real thinking her real decisions were for a later time when she
was not so driven by the press of unexpected circumstances That less
stressful time was now beginning

What was she to do next What were to be her final decisions And what
in all this strange ferment was likely to germinate as possible forces
against her

She mulled these things over for several days during which Dick came to
see her twice and twice proposed and was twice put off She had quiet
now and was most of the time alone but that clarity which she had
expected that quickness and surety of purpose which she had always
believed to be unfailingly hers refused to come

She tried to have it otherwise but the outstanding figure in her
meditations was Larry Larry who had not exposed her at the Sherwoods
and whose influence had caused Hunt also not to expose herLarry who
without deception was on a familiar footing at the Sherwoods where she
had been received only through trickeryLarry a fugitive in danger
from so many enemies perhaps after all undeserved enemiesLarry
who looked to be making good on his boast to achieve success through
honestyLarry who had again told her that he loved her She liked Dick
Sherwoodshe really did But Larrythat was something different

And thus she thought on drawn this way and that and unable to reach a
decision But with most people when in a state of acute mental turmoil
that which has been most definite in the past instinct habit of mind
purpose tradition becomes at least temporarily the dominant factor
through the mere circumstance that it has existed powerfully before
through its comparative stability through its semipermanence And so
with Maggie She had for that one afternoon almost been won over against
herself by the workings of Larrys secret diplomacy Then had come
the natural reaction And now in her turmoil in so far as she had any
decision it was instinctively to go right ahead in the direction in
which she had been going

But on the sixth day of her uncertainty just after Dick had called on
her and she had provisionally accepted an invitation to Cedar Crest for
the following afternoon a danger which she had half seen from the
start burst upon her without a moments warning It came into her
sittingroom just before her dinner hour in the dual form of Barney
and Old Jimmie The faces of both were lowering

Get rid of that boob chaperon of yours gritted Barney Were going
to have some real talk

Maggie stepped to the connecting door sent Miss Grierson on an
inconsequential errand and returned

Youre looking as pleasant as if you were sitting for a new photograph
Barney What gives you that sweet expression

Youll cut out your comicsupplement stuff in just one second Barney
warned her We both saw young Sherwood awhile ago as he was leaving the
Grantham and he told us everything

Persiflage did indeed fail Maggie Everything she exclaimed Whats
everything

He told us about proposing to you almost a week ago and about your
refusing him And you lied to uskept us sitting round wasting our
timeand all the while youve been doublecrossing us

Those visitors from South and West especially the women who a few
nights before on the roof had regarded Barney as the perfect courtier
would not have so esteemed him if they had seen him at the present
moment He seized Maggies wrists and all the evil of his violent
nature glared from his small bright eyes

Damn you he cried Jimmie shes yours and a fathers got a right
to do anything he likes to his own daughter Give it to her proper if
she dont come across with the truth

Jimmie stepped closer to her and bared his yellow teeth I havent
given you a basting since you were fifteenbut Ill paste you one right
in the mouth if you dont talk straight talk

You hear that Barney gritted at her He believed there was justice in
his wrathas indeed there was of a sort Think what Jimmie and Ive
put into this in time and hard coin Weve given you your chance weve
made you And then after hard work and waiting and our spending so
much and everything comes out exactly as we figured you go and throw
us downnot just yourself but us and our rights Now you talk straight
stuff Tell us why did you refuse Sherwood when he proposed And why
did you tell me that lie about his not proposing

Maggie realized she was in a desperate plight with these two inflamed
gazes upon her Never had she felt so little of a daughters liking for
Old Jimmie as now when she looked into his lean harsh yellowfanged
face And she had no illusions about Barney He might love her as she
knew he did but that would not be a check upon his ruthlessness if he
thought himself balked or betrayed

Just then her telephone began to ring She started to move toward it
but Barneys grip checked her short

Youre going to answer menot any damned telephone Let it ring

The bell rang for a minute or two before it stilled its shrill clamor
Its ringing was in a way a brief respite to Maggie for it gave her
additional time to consider what should be her course She realized
that she dared not let Barney believe at this moment that she had turned
against him Again she fell back upon her cool selfconfident manner

You want to know why The answer is simple enough I thought I might
try out an improvement of our plansomething that might suit me
better

Whats that Barney harshly demanded

Since Miss Sherwood fell for me so easy it struck me that shed be
pretty sure to fall for me if I told her the whole truth about myself
That is everything except our scheme to play Dick for a sucker

Whatre you driving at

Dont you see If she forgave me being what I am and I rather think
she would and with Dick liking me as he doeswhy it struck me as the
best thing for yours truly to marry Dick for keeps

What Though Barneys voice was low it had the effect of a startled
and savage roar And chuck us overboard

Not at all If I married Dick for keeps I intended to pay you a lump
sum or else a regular amount each year

No you dont Barney cried in the same muffled roar

Perhaps notI havent decided Maggie said evenly Ive merely been
telling you as you requested me why I did as I did I refused Dick
and lied to you so that I might have more time to think over what I
really wanted to do

Instinctively she had counted on rousing Barneys jealousy in order to
throw him off the track of her real thoughts She succeeded

I can tell you what youre going to do Barney flung at her with
fierce mastery Youre not going to put over a sureenough marriage
with any Dick Sherwood When theres that kind of a marriage Im going
to be the man And youre going to go right straight ahead with our old
plan Dickll propose again if you give him half a chance And when he
does you say yes Understand Thats what youre going to do

There was no safety in openly defying Barney And as a matter of fact
what he had ordered was what in the shifting currents of her thoughts
the steady momentum of her old ambitions and purposes had been pushing
her toward So she said in her even voice

You waste such a lot of your good energy Barney by exploding when
theres nothing to blow up Thats exactly what Id decided to do Miss
Sherwood has asked me out to Cedar Crest tomorrow afternoon and Im
going

Barney let go the hold he had kept upon her wrists and the dark look
slowly lifted from his face Why didnt you tell a fellow this at
first he half grumbled Then with a grim enthusiasm And when you
come back youre going to tell us its all settled

Of courseif he asks me And now suppose you two go away Youve given
me a headache and I want to rest

Well go said Barney But there may be some more points about this
that we may want to talk over a little later tonight So better get all
the rest you can

But when they had gone and left her to the silence of her pretentious
and characterless suite Maggie did not rest She had made up her mind
she was going to do as she had said But there was still that same
turmoil within her

Again she thought of Larry But she would not admit to herself that her
real motive for suddenly deciding to go to Cedar Crest on the morrow was
the chance of seeing him




CHAPTER XXVI


During all these days Larry waited for news of the result of the
experiment in psychology which meant so much to his life He had not
expected to hear directly from Maggie but he had counted upon learning
at once from Dick if not by words then either from eloquent dejection
which would proclaim Dicks refusal and Larrys success or from an
ebullient joy which would proclaim that Maggie had accepted him But
Dicks sober but not unhappy behavior announced neither of these two
to Larry and the matter was too personal altogether too delicate to
permit Larry to ask Dick the result however subtly he might ask it

So Larry could only waitand wonder The truth did not occur to Larry
he did not see that there might be another alternative to the two
possible reactions he had calculated upon He did not bear in mind that
Maggies youthful obstinacy her belief in herself and her ways were
too solid a structure to yield at once to one moral shock however
wisely planned and however strong He did not at this time hold in mind
that any real change in so decided a character as Maggie if change
there was to be would be preceded and accompanied by a turbulent period
in which she would hardly know who she was or where she was or what
she was going to doand that at the end of such a period there might be
no change at all

Inasmuch as just then Maggie was his major interest it seemed to Larry
in his safe seclusion that he was merely marking time and marking time
with feet that were frantically impatient He felt he could not stand
much longer his own inactivity and his ignorance of what Maggie was
doing and what was happening to her He could not remain in this
sanctuary pulling strings and very long and fragile strings and
strings which might be the mistaken ones for any much greater period
He felt that he simply had to walk out of this splendid safety back
into the dangers from which he had fled where he might at least have
the possible advantage of being in the very midst of Maggies affairs
and fight for her more openly and have a more direct influence upon her

He knew that sooner or later he was going to throw caution aside
and appear suddenly among his enemies unless something of a definite
character developed But for these slow irritating days he held himself
in check with difficulty hoping that things might come to him that he
would not have to go forth to them

He had brought Hunts portrait of Maggie to Cedar Crest in the bottom of
his trunk and kept it locked in his chiffonier During these days
more frequently than before he would take out the portrait and in
the security of his locked room would gaze long at that keenvisioned
portrayal of her many characters No doubt of it there was a possible
splendid woman there And no doubt of it he loved that woman utterly

During these days of his ignorance while Maggie was struggling in the
darkness of her unexplored being Larry drove himself grimly at the
business to which under happier circumstances he would have gone under
the irresistible suasion of pure joy One afternoon he presented to
Miss Sherwood an outline for his growing plan for the development of
the Sherwood properties on the basis of good homes at fair rentals He
discovered that in spite of her generous giving she had much the same
attitude toward Charity as his own that the only sound Charity except
for those temporarily or permanently handicapped or disabled was the
giving of honest values for honest returnsand that was not Charity at
all

The project of reforming the shiftless character of the Sherwood
properties and of relieving even in a small degree New Yorks housing
congestion appealed at once to her imagination and her sensible
idealism

A splendid plan she exclaimed regarding Larry with those wise
humorous eyes of hers which were now very serious and penetrating You
have been working much harder than I had thought And if you will pardon
my saying it you have more of the soundly humane vision which big
business enterprise should have than I had thought

Thank you said Larry

Thats a splendid dream she continued but it will take hard work to
translate that dream into a reality We shall need architects builders
a heavy initial expense timeand a more modern and alert management

Yes Miss Sherwood

She did not speak for a moment Her penetrating eyes which had been
fixed on him in close thought were yet more penetrating Finally she
said

Thats a big thing a useful thing The present agents wish to be
relieved of our affairs as soon as I can make arrangementsand Id
like nothing better than for Dick to drop what hes doing and get into
something constructive and useful like this But Dick cannot do it
alone hes too unsettled and too inexperienced to cope with some of
the sharper business practices

She paused again still regarding him with those keen eyes which seemed
to be weighing him Finally she said almost abruptly

Will you take charge of this with Dick He likes you and respects
your judgment Im sure youd help steady him down Of course you lack
practical experience but you can take in a practical man who will
supply this element Practical experience is one of the commonest
articles on the market vision and initiative are among the rarestand
you have them What do you say

Larry could not say anything at once The suddenness of her offer the
largeness of his opportunity bewildered him for the moment And his
bewilderment was added to by his swift realization of quite another
element involved in her frank proposition He was now engaged in the
enterprise of foisting a bogus article Maggie upon this woman who was
offering him her complete confidencean enterprise of most questionable
ethics and very dubious issue If he accepted her offer and the result
of this enterprise were disaster what would Miss Sherwood then think of
him

He took refuge in evasion Im not going to try to tell you how much
I appreciate your proposition Miss Sherwood But do you mind if I hold
back my answer for the present and think it over Anyhow to do all
that is required I must be able to work in the openand I cant do
that until I get free of my entanglements with the police and my old
acquaintances

Thus it was agreed upon Miss Sherwood turned to another subject The
prepublic show of Hunts pictures had opened the previous day

When you were in the city yesterday did you get in to see Mr Hunts
exhibition

No he answered Although I wanted to But you know Ive already seen
all of Mr Hunts pictures that Mr Graham has in his gallery How was
the opening

Crowded with guests And since they had been told that the pictures
were unusual and good of course the people were enthusiastic

What kind of prices was Mr Graham quoting

He wasnt quoting any He told me he wasnt going to sell a picture
or even mention a price until the public exhibition Hes very
enthusiastic He thinks Mr Hunt is already madeand in a big way

And then she added her level gaze very steady on Larry

Of course Mr Hunt is really a great painter But he needed a jolt to
make him go out and really paint his own kind of stuff And he needed
some one like you to put him across in a business way

When she left she left Larry thinking thinking of her saying that
Hunt needed a jolt to make him go out and really paint his own kind
of stuff Hidden behind that remark somewhere could there be the
explanation for the break between these two Larry began to see a
glimmer of light It was entirely possible that Miss Sherwood in so
finished and adroit a manner that Hunt had not discerned her purpose
had herself given him this jolt or at least contributed to its force It
might all have been diplomacy on her part applied shrewdly to the
man she understood and loved Yes that might be the explanation Yes
perhaps she had been doing in a less trying way just what he was seeking
to do under more stressful circumstances with Maggie to arouse him to
his best by indirectly working at definite psychological reactions

That afternoon Hunt appeared at Cedar Crest and while there dropped in
on Larry The big painter in his fullblooded boyish fashion fairly
gasconaded over the success of his exhibit Larry smiled at the others
exuberant enthusiasm Hunt was one man who could boast without ever
being offensively egotistical for Hunt added to his other gifts had
the divine gift of being able to laugh at himself

Larry saw here an opportunity to forward that other ambition of his
the bringing of Hunt and Miss Sherwood together And at this instant
it flashed upon him that Miss Sherwoods seemingly casual remarks about
Hunt had not been casual at all Perhaps they had been carefully thought
out and spoken with a definite purpose Perhaps Miss Sherwood had been
very subtly appointing him her ambassador She was clever enough for
that

Stop declaiming those selfwritten press notices of your unapproachable
superiority Larry interrupted If you use your breath up like that
youll drown on dry land Besides I just heard something better than
this mere articulated air of yours Better because from a person in her
senses

Heard it from whom

Miss Sherwood

Miss Sherwood What did she say

That you were a really great painter

Huh snorted Hunt Why shouldnt she say that Ive proved it

Hunt said Larry evenly you are the greatest painter I ever met
but you also have the distinction of being the greatest of all damned
fools

Whats that young fellow

You love Miss Sherwood dont you At least youve the same as told me
that in words and youve told me that in loudvoiced actions every time
youve seen her

Wellwhat if I do

If you had the clearness of vision that is in the glassy eye of a cold
boiled lobster you would see that she feels the same way about you

See here Larryall the boisterous quality had gone from Hunts
voice and it was lowpitched and a bit unsteadyI dont mind your
joshing me about myself or my painting but dont fool with me about
anything thats really important

Im not fooling you Im sure Miss Sherwood feels that way

How do you know

Ive got a pair of eyes that dont belong to a cold boiled lobster And
when I see a thing I know I see it

Youre all wrong Larry If youd heard what she said to me less than a
year ago

You make me tired interrupted Larry You two were made for each
other Shes waiting for you to step up and talk mans talk to herand
instead you sulk in your tent and mumble about something you think she
might have thought or said a year ago Youre too sensitive youre too
proud youve got too few brains Its a million dollars to one that in
your handsome wellbred way youve fallen out with her over something
that probably never existed and certainly doesnt exist now Forget it
all and walk right up and ask her

Larry if I thought there was a chance that you are right

A single question will prove whether Im right

Hunt did not speak for a moment I guess Ive never seen my part of it
all in the way you put it Larry He stood up his whole being subdued
yet tense Im going to slide back into town and think it all over

Larry followed him an hour later bent on routine business of the
Sherwood estate Toward seven oclock he was studying the present
decrepitude and future possibilities of a row of Sherwood apartment
houses on the West Side when as he came out of one building and
started into another a firm hand fell upon his shoulder and a voice
remarked

So Larry youre in New York

Larry whirled about For the moment he felt all the life go out of him
Beside him stood Detective Casey whom he had last seen on the night
of his wild flight when Casey had feigned a knockout in order to aid
Larrys escape from Gavegan Any other man affiliated with his enemies
Larry would have struck down and tried to break away from But not
Casey

Hello Casey Well I suppose youre going to invite me to go along
with you

Where were you going

Into this house

Then Ill invite myself to go along with you

He quickly pushed Larry before him into the hallway which was empty
since all the tenants were at their dinner Larry remembered the scene
down in Deputy Police Commissioner Barlows office when the Chief of
Detectives had demanded that he become a stoolpigeon working under
Gavegan and Casey and the grilling and the threats more than
fulfilled which had followed

Going to give me a little private quiz first Casey he asked and
then call in Gavegan and lead me down to Barlow

Not unless Gavegan or some one else saw and recognized you which
I know they didnt since I was watching for that very thing And not
unless you yourself feel hungry for a visit to Headquarters

If I feel hungry its an appetite Im willing to make wait

You know I dont want to pinch you My part in this has been a dirty
job that was just pushed my way You know that I know youve been framed
and doublecrossed and that I wont run you in unless I cant get out
of it

Thanks Casey Youre too white to have to run with people like Barlow
and Gavegan But if it wasnt to pinch me why did you stop me out there
in the street

Been hoping I might some day run into you on the quiet There are some
things Ive learnednever mind howthat I wanted to slip you for your
own good

Go to it Casey

First Ive got a hunch that it was Barney Palmer who tipped off the
police about Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt and then spread it among
all the crooks that you were the stool and squealer

Yes Id guessed that much

Second Ive got a hunch that it really was from Barney Palmer that
Barlow got his idea of making you become a stoolpigeon Barney is a
smooth one all right and he figured what would happen He knew you
would refuse and he knew Barlow would uncork hell beneath you Barney
certainly called every turn

Whatwhat stammered Larry Why then Barney must be He paused
utterly astounded by the newness of the possibility that had just risen
in his mind

Youve got it Larry Casey went on Barney is a police stool Has
been one for years Works directly for Barlow Were not supposed to
know anything about it Hes turned up a lot of big ones Thats why
its safe for Barney to pull off anything he likes

Barney a police stool Larry repeated in the stupor of his amazement

Guess thats all the news I wanted to hand you Larry so Ill be on my
way Heres wishing you luckand for Gods sake dont let yourself be
pinched by us Solong And with that Casey slipped out of the hallway

For a moment Larry stood moveless where Casey had left him Then fierce
purpose and a cautious recklessness surged up and took mastery of him
It had required what Casey had told him to end his irksome waiting and
wavering No longer could he remain in his hidingplace safe himself
trying to save Maggie by slow indirect endeavor The time had now come
for very different methods The time had come to step forth into the
open taking of course no unnecessary risk and to have it out face to
face with his enemies who were also Maggies real enemies though she
counted them her friendsto save Maggie against her own will if he
could save her in no other way

And having so decided Larry walked quickly out of the hallway into the
street




CHAPTER XXVII


On the sidewalk Larry glanced swiftly around him Half a block down the
street on the front of a drugstore was a blue telephone flag A minute
later he was inside a telephone booth in the drugstore asking first
for the Hotel Grantham and then asking the Grantham operator to be
connected with Miss Maggie Cameron

There was a long wait While he listened for Maggies voice he blazed
with terrible fury against Barney Paler For Maggie to be connected with
a straight crook that idea had been bad enough But for her to be under
the influence of the worst crook of all a stool a cunning traitor to
his own friendsthat was more than could possibly be stood In his rage
in Maggies behalf he forgot for the moment the many evils Barney had
done to himself He thought of wild incoherent vaguely tremendous
plans First he would get Maggie away from Barney and Old
Jimmiesomehow Then he would square accounts with those twoagain by
an undefined somehow

Presently the tired impersonal voice of the Grantham operator remarked
against his eardrum Miss Cameron dont answer

Have her paged please he requested

Larry of course could not know that his telephone call was the very
one which had rung in Maggies room while Barney and Old Jimmie
were with her and which Barney had harshly forbidden her to answer
Therefore he could not know that any attempt to get Maggie by telephone
just then was futile

When he came out of the booth the impersonal voice having informed
him that Miss Cameron was not in it was with the intention of calling
Maggie up between eight and nine when she probably would have returned
from dinner where he judged her now to be He knew that Dick Sherwood
had no engagement with her for Dick was to be out at Cedar Crest that
evening so he judged it almost certain Maggie would be at home and
alone later on

Having nothing else to do for an hour and a half he thought of a note
he had received from the Duchess in that mornings mail asking him to
come down to see her when he was next in town Thirty minutes later he
was in the familiar room behind the pawnshop The Duchess asked him
if he had eaten and on his reply that he had not and did not care
to instead of proceeding to the business of her letter she mumbled
something and went into the pawnshop

She left Larry for the very simple reason that now that she had him
here she was uncertain what she should say and how far she should go
Unknown to either one thread of the drama of Larry and Maggie was being
spun in the brain and heart of the Duchess and being spun with pain
to her and in very great doubt True she had definitely decided for
Larrys welfare that the facts about Maggies parentage should never be
known from herand since the only other person who could tell the truth
was Jimmie Carlisle and his interests were all apparently in favor of
silence then it followed that the truth would never be known from any
one But having so decided and decided definitely and finally the
Duchess had proceeded to wonder if she had decided wisely

Day and night this had been the main subject of her thought Could she
be wrong in her estimate of Maggies character and what she might turn
out to be Could she be wrong in her belief that given enough time
Larry would outgrow his infatuation for Maggie And since she was in
such doubt about these two points had she any right and was it for the
best to suppress a fact that might so gravely influence both matters
She did not know What she wanted was whatever was best for Larryand
so in her doubt she had determined to talk again to Larry hoping that
the interview might in some way replace her uncertainty with stability
of purpose

Presently she returned to the inner room and in her direct way
and using the fewest possible words which had created for her her
reputation of a woman who never spoke and who was packed with strange
secrets she asked Larry what he had done concerning Maggie He told
her of the plan he had evolved of Maggies visit to Cedar Crest of
his ignorance of Maggies reactions To all this his grandmother made
response neither by word nor by change of expression He then went on to
tell her of what he had just learned from Casey of Barneys maneuvering
his misfortunes

The old head nodded Yes Barneys just that sort she said in her
flat monotone

And then she came to the purpose of her sending for him How do you
feel about Maggie now

The same as before

You love her

Yesand always will he said firmly

She was silent once more Then What are you going to do next

Break things up between her and Barney and her father Get her away
from them

She asked no further questions Larry was as settled as a man could
be But was Maggie worth whilethat was the great question still
unanswered

Just what did you want me for grandmother he asked her finally

Something which I thought might have developed but which hasnt

And so she let him go away without telling him And wishing to shape
things for the best for him she was troubled by the same doubts as
before

His visit with his grandmother had had no meaning to Larry since he
had no guess of the struggle going on within that ancient inscrutable
figure The visit had for him merely served to fill in a nervous
useless hour His rage against Barney had all the while possessed him
too thoroughly for him to give more than the mere surface of his mind
to what had passed between his grandmother and himself And when he had
left her his rage at Barneys treachery and his impetuous desire to
snatch Maggie away from her present influences so stormed within him
that his usually cautious judgment was blown away and recklessness swept
like a gale into control of him

When he called up the Grantham a second time at nine oclock Maggies
voice came to him

Hello Who this please

Mr Brandon

He heard a stilted Oh at the other end of the line Im coming right
up to see you he said

II dont think you

Ill be there in then minutes Larry interrupted the startled voice
and hung up

He counted that Maggie after his sparing her at Cedar Crest would
receive him and treat him at least no worse than an enemy with whom
there was a half hours truce Sure enough when he rang the bell of her
suite Maggie herself admitted him to her sittingroom She was taut and
pale her look neither friendly nor unfriendly

Dont you know the risk youre running she whispered when the door
was closedcoming here like this in the open

The time has come for risks Maggie he announced

But you were safe enough where you were Why take such risks

For your sake

My sake

To take you away from these people youre tied up with Take you away
now

At an earlier time this would have been a fuse to a detonation of
defiance from her But now she said nothing at all and that was
something

Since Ive come out into the open everythings going to be in the
open Listen Maggie The impulse had suddenly come upon him since
his plan to awaken Maggie by her psychological reactions had apparently
failed to tell her everything Listen Maggie Im going to lay all
my cards on the table and show you every card Ive played You were
invited to come out to Cedar Crest because I schemed to have you come
And the reason I schemed to have you invited was I reasoned that being
received in such a frank generous unsuspecting way by a woman like
Miss Sherwood would make you sick of what you were doing and you would
drop it of your own accord But it seems I reasoned wrong

Soyou were behind that she breathed

I was Though I couldnt have done it if Dick Sherwood hadnt been
honestly infatuated with you But now Im through with working under
cover through with indirect methods From now on every plays in the
open and its straight to the point with everything So get ready Im
going to take you away from Barney and Old Jimmie

The mention of these two names had a swift and magical effect upon her
But instead of arousing belligerency they aroused an almost frantic
agitation

You must leave at once Larry Barney and my father were here before
dinner and theyve just telephoned they were coming back

Coming back Thats the best argument you could make for my staying

But Larrythey both have keys and Barney always carries a gun

I stay here unless you leave with me Listen to some more Maggie I
laid all the cards on the table Do you know the kind of people youre
tied up with Ill not say anything about your father for I guess you
know all there is to know But Barney Palmer Hes the lowest kind of
crook that breathes Theres been a lot of talk about squealers and
police stools Well the big squealer the big stool is Barney Palmer

I dont believe it she cried involuntarily

Its true Ive got it straight Barney wanted to smash me because Id
made up my mind to quit the old game and because he wanted to get me
out of his way with you So he framed it up so that I appeared to be a
squealer and started the gangmen after me And he put Barlow up to the
idea of forcing me to be a stool and then framing me when I refused
It was Barney who fixed things so I had to go to jail or be shot up
or run away It was Barney Palmer who squealed on Red Hannigan and Jack
Rosenfeldt and whos been squealing on his other pals And thats the
sort youre stringing along with

She gazed at him in appalled half conviction He remained silent to let
his truth sink in

They were standing so face to face when a key grated in the outer door
of the little hallway as on the occasion of Larrys first visit here
And as on that occasion Maggie sprang swiftly forward and shot home the
bolt of the inner door Then she turned and caught Larrys arm

Its BarneyI told you he was coming she whispered Oh why didnt
you go before Come on

She tried to drag him toward her bedroom door through which she had
once helped him escape But this time he was not to be moved

I stay right here he said to her

There was the sound of a futile effort to turn the lock of the inner
door then Barneys voice called out Whats the matter Maggie Open
the door

Maggie still clutching Larrys resisting arm stood gasping in
wideeyed consternation

Open the door for them Maggie Larry whispered

Ill not do it she whispered back

Open it or I will he ordered

Their gazes held a moment longer while Barney rattled at the lock Then
slowly falteringly her amazed eyes over her shoulder upon him Maggie
crossed and unlocked the door Barney entered Old Jimmie just bend him

I say Maggie what was the big idea in keeping us he was beginning
in a grumbling tone when he saw Larry just beyond her His complaint
broke off in midbreath he stopped short and his dark face twitched
with his surprise

Larry Brainard he finally exclaimed Old Jimmie suddenly tense
blinked and said nothing

Hello Barney hello Jimmie Larry greeted his former allies putting
on an air of geniality Been a long time since we three met Dont
stand there in the door Come right in

Barney was keen enough to see though Larrys attitude was careless and
his tone light that his eyes were bright and hard Barney moved forward
a couple of paces alert for anything and Old Jimmie followed
Maggie looked on at the three men her girlish figure taut and hardly
breathing

Didnt know you were in New York said Barney

Well here I am all right returned Larry with his menacing
cheerfulness

By now Barney had recovered from his first surprise He felt it time to
assert his supremacy

How do you come to be here with Maggie he demanded abruptly

Happened to catch sight of her on the street today Trailed her here
to the Grantham and tonight I just dropped in

Barneys tone grew more authoritative more ugly We told you long ago
we were through with you So why did you come here

Thats easy answered Barney The last time we were all together youd
come to take Maggie away This is that same scene reproducedonly this
time Ive come to take Maggie away

Whats that snapped Barney

Larrys voice threw off its assumed geniality and became drivingly
hard And to get Maggie to come Ive been telling her the kind of a
bird you are Barney Palmer Oh Ive got the straight dope on you Ive
been telling her how you framed me and were able to frame me because
you are Chief Barlows stool

Barney went as near white as it was possible for him to become and his
mouth sagged Whatwhat he stammered

Ive been telling her that you are the one who really squealed on Red
Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt

Youre a damned liar Barney burst out and instantly from beneath
his left arm he whipped an automatic which he thrust against Larrys
stomach Take that back damn you or Ill blow you straight to hell

BarneyLarry interjected Maggie in sickened fright

This is nothing to worry over Maggie Larry said He looked back at
Barney Oh I knew you would flash a gun on me at some stage of the
game But youre not going to shoot

Youll see if you dont take that back

Larry realized that his hot blood had driven him into an enterprise of
daring in which only bluff and the playing of his highest cards could
help him through

You dont think I was such a fool as to walk into this place without
taking precautions he said contemptuously You wont shoot Barney
because since I knew I might meet you and youd pull a gun I had myself
searched by two friends just before I came up here Theyll testify I
was not armed They know you and know you so well that theyll be able
to identify the thing in your hand as your gun So no matter what Maggie
and Jimmie may testify the verdict will be coldblooded murder and
the electric chair will be your finish And thats why I know you wont
shoot So you might as well put the gun away

Barney neither spoke nor moved

Ive called your bluff Barney Larry said sharply Put that gun
away or Ill take it from you

Barneys glare wavered The pistol sank from its position With a
lightningswift motion Larry wrenched it from Barneys hand

Guess Id better have it after all he said slipping it into a
pocket Keep you out of temptation

And then in a subdued voice that was steely with menace Im too busy
to attend to you now Barneybut by God Im going to square things
with you for the dirt youve done me and Im going to show you up for
a stool and a squealer He wheeled on Old Jimmie And the only reason
Ill be easy with you Jimmie Carlisle is because you are Maggies
fatherthough youre the rottenest thing as a father God ever let
breathe

Old Jimmie shrank slightly before Larrys glower and his little eyes
gleamed with the fear of a rat that is cornered But he said nothing

Larry turned his back upon the two men Were through with this bunch
Maggie Put on a hat and a wrap and lets go We can send for your
things

No you dont Maggie snarled Barney before Maggie could speak

Old Jimmie made his first positive motion since entering the room He
shifted quickly to Maggies side and seized her arm

Youre my daughter and you stay with me he ordered I brought
you up and you do exactly what I tell you to Youre not going with
Larryhes lying about Barney You stay with me

Come on lets go Maggie repeated Larry

You stay with me repeated Jimmie

Thus ordered and appealed to Maggie was areel with contradicting
thoughts and impulses while the three men awaited her action In fact
she had no clear thought at all She never knew later what determined
her course at this bewildered moment perhaps it was partly a
continuance of her doubt of Larry perhaps partly once more sheer
momentum perhaps her instinctive feeling that her place was with the
man she believed to be her father

Yes Ill stay with you she said to Old Jimmie

Thats the signal for you to be on your way Larry Brainard Barney
snapped at him triumphantly

Larry realized all of a sudden that his coming here was no more than
a splendid gesture to which his anger had excited him Indeed there was
nothing for him but to be on his way

Ive told you the truth Maggie and youll be sorry that you have not
leftif not sorry soon then sorry a little later

He turned to Barney with a last shot he could not leave the gloating
Barney Palmer his unalloyed triumph I told you I had the straight dope
on you Barney Heres some more of it I know exactly what your game
is and I know exactly who your sucker is Well see if you put it
overyou squealer Goodnight all

With that Larry walked out Old Jimmie regarded his partner with
suspicion

How about that Barneyyou being a stool and a squealer he demanded

I tell you its all a liea damned lie cried Barney with feverish
emphasis

I hope it is breathed Old Jimmie

This was a subject Barney wanted to get away from Maggie he
demanded is what Larry Brainard said about how he came here the
truthhis seeing you on the street and then following you here

How do I know where he first saw me

But is tonight the first time youve seen him

It is

Sure you havent been seeing him demanded Barneys quick jealousy

I have not

Did he tell you where he came fromwhere he hangs out

No

Old Jimmie interrupted this crossexamination

Youre wasting good time asking these questions Barney do you realize
the cold fact that its not a good thing for you nor for us for Larry
Brainard to be back in New York floating around as he pleases

I should say not Barney saw he was facing a sudden crisis and in the
need for quick action he spoke without thought of Maggie Weve got to
look after him at once

Tell the bunch hes back and let them take care of him suggested Old
Jimmie

Barney considered rapidly If Larry knew of his arrangement with the
police then perhaps his secret was beginning to leak through to others
He decided that for the present it would be wiser to keep from these old
friends and allies

Not the bunchthe police he said inspiredly Theyre after him
anyhow and are sore All weve got to do is slip them wordtheyll do
the rest And then with the sharper emphasis of an immediate plan We
dont want to lose a minute I know where Gavegan hangs out at this time
of night Come on

With a bare Goodnight to Maggie the two men hurried forth on their
pressing mission Left to herself Maggie sank into a chair and wildly
considered the many elements of this new situation Presently two
thoughts emerged to dominance Whether Larry was right or wrong he had
risked coming out of his safety for her sakeperhaps had risked all he
had won for her sake And now the police were to be set after him with
that Gavegan heading the pack

Perhaps the further thinking Maggie did did not result in cool mature
wisdomfor her thoughts were the operations of a panicky mind Somehow
she had to get warning to Larry of this imminent police hunt Without
doubt Larry would return to Cedar Crest sometime that night Word should
be sent to him there A letter was too uncertain in such a crisis
Of course she had an invitation to go to Cedar Crest the following
afternoon and she might warn him thenbut that might be too late
She dared not telephone or telegraphfor that might somehow direct
dangerous attention to the exact spot where Larry was hidden Also she
had an instinct operating unconsciously long before she had any thought
of what she was eventually to do not to let Barney or Old Jimmie find
out or even guess that she had warned Larrynot yet

There seemed nothing that she herself could do Then she thought of the
Duchess That was the way out The Duchess would know some way in which
to get Larry word

Five minutes later in her plainest suit and hat Maggie in a taxicab
was rolling down toward the Duchesssfrom where only a few months
back she had started forth upon her great career




CHAPTER XXVIII


Old Jimmie did not like meeting the police any oftener than a meeting
was forced upon him and so he slipped away and allowed Barney Palmer
to undertake alone the business of settling Larry Barney found Gavegan
exactly where he had counted lingering over his late dinner in the cafe
of a famous Broadway restauranta favorite with some of the detectives
and higher officials of the Police Departmentin which cafe in happier
days now deeply mourned Gavegan had had all the exhilaration he wanted
to drink at the standing invitation of the proprietor and where even
yet on occasion a bit of the old exhilaration was brought to Gavegans
table in a cup or served him in a room above to which he had had
whispered instructions to retire The proprietor had in the old days
liked to stand well with the police and though his bar was now devoted
to legal drinksor at least obliging Federal officers reported it to
behe still liked to stand well with the police

Gavegan was at a table with a minor producer of musical shows to
whom Barney had been of occasional service in securing the predominant
essential of such musicnamely shapely young women Barney nodded
to Gavegan chatted for a few minutes with his musicalcomedy friend
during which he gave Gavegan a signal then crossed to the oncecrowded
bar now sunk to isolation and the lowly estate of soft drinks and
ordered a ginger ale Not until then did he notice Barlow chief of the
Detective Bureau at a corner table Barney gave no sign of recognition
and Barlow after a casual glance at him returned to his food

Barney in solitude at one end of the bar slowly sipped with a sort of
indignation against his kickless purchase Presently Gavegan was beside
him having most convincing illluck in his attempts to light his cigar
from a box of splintering safety matches which stood at that end of the
bar

Well what is it Gavegan whispered out of that corner of his mouth
which was not occupied by his cigar He did not look at Barney

Any clue to Larry Brainard yet Barney whispered also out of a corner
of his mouth glass at his lips Likewise he seemed not to notice the
man beside him

Naw Still out West somewhere Them Chicago bums couldnt catch a crook
if he walked along State Street with a signboard on him

Saw Larry Brainard tonight

Gavegan had difficulty in maintaining his attitude of nonawareness of
his barmate

Where

Right here in New York

What Whered you see him

Coming out of the Grantham

When

Fifteen minutes ago

Know where he went towhere he hangs outknow anything else

Thats everything Thought Id better slip it to you as quick as I
could

This time that birdll not get away growled Gavegan still in a
whisper Twentyfour hours and hell be in the cooler

Finally Gavegan managed to get a flame from one of those irritatingly
splintery Swedish matches made in Japan Cigar alight he walked over to
Barlows table He conversed with his Chief a moment or two then went
out After a minute Barney saw Chief Barlow crossing toward the bar
Barney seemed not to notice this movement Barlow likewise paused beside
him to light a cigar and from the side of the Chiefs mouth there
issued Room 613

Barlow passed on Presently Barney finished the dreary drudgery of
drink and sauntered out Five minutes later having exercised the proper
caution he was in Room 613 and the door was locked

Whats this dope you just handed Gavegan about Larry Brainard
demanded Barlow

Barney gave his information again but this time more fully Of course
he omitted all mention of Maggie and the enterprise which Larry had
sought to interrupt it was part of the tacit understanding between
these two that Barlow should have no knowledge of Barneys professional
doings unless such knowledge should be forced upon him by events or
people too strong to be ignored

Did Brainard drop any clue that might give us a lead as to where hes
hiding out

Barney remembered something Larry had said half an hour before which he
had considered mere boasting He said he knew I had some game on and
he said he knew who the sucker was I was planning to trim

Did he say who the sucker was

No

If Larry Brainard really did know then who would he be having in
mind

Barney hesitated but he perceived that this was a question which had
to be answered Young Dick Sherwood of the swell Sherwood familyyou
know

Barlow did not pursue the subject According to his arrangement with
Barney the latters private activities were none of his business

Ill get busy with the dragnet well land Brainard this time said
Barlow And then with a grim look at Barney But Larry Brainards not
what I got you up here to talk about Palmer I wanted to talk about two
words to youand say em to you right between your eyes

Go ahead Chief

First you aint been worth a damn to me for several months Youve
given me no value received for me keeping my men off of you You havent
turned up a single thing

Come now Chiefyoure forgetting about Red Hannigan and Jack
Rosenfeldt

Chicken feed Theyre out on bail and when their cases come up
theyll beat them Besides you didnt give me that tip to help me you
gave it to me so that you could fix things to put Larry Brainard in bad
with all his old friends You did that to help yourself Shut up Dont
try to deny it I know

Barney did not attempt denial Barlow went on

And the second thing I want to tell you and tell you hard is this
You gotta turn in some business The easy way youve been going makes
it look like youve forgot Ive got hold of you where the hairs long
Young man youd better remember that Ive got you cold for that Gregory
stock businessyou and Old Jimmie Carlisle Got all the papers in a
safetydeposit vault and got three witnesses doing stretches in Sing
Sing Keep on telling yourself all that and keep on telling yourself
that if you dont come across some day soon Ill suddenly discover
that youre the guilty party in that Gregory affair and Ill bring down
those witnesses Ive got cached in Sing Sing

Barney moved uneasily in his chair He knew the bargain he had made and
did not like to dwell upon the conditions under which he was a licensed
adventurer

No need to rag me like this Chief he protested Sure I remember all
youve said And youre not going to have cause to be sore much longer
Therell be plenty doing

See that there is And see that you dont pull any raw work And see
that you dont let your foot slip For if you do you know whatll
happen to you Now get out

Barney got out again protesting that he would not be found failing He
was not greatly disturbed by what Barlow had said Every so often there
had to be just such sessions and every so often Barlow had to let off
just such steam

Barneys errand was done The police of the city were on Larrys trail
and his share in the matter was and would remain unknown Thus far all
was well He had no doubt of Larrys early capture now that he was
back in New York and now that the whole police force had been promptly
warned and were hotly after him and now that all avenues of exit would
instantly be in fact by this time were under surveillance and closed
against himand now that every refuge of the criminal world was only a
trap for him No there wasnt a doubt of Larrys early capture There
couldnt be And once Larry was locked up things would be much better
Barlow would see that Larry didnt talk undesirable things or at least
that such talk was not heard It wasnt exactly pleasant or safe having
Larry at large free to blurt out to the wrong persons those things
about Barneys being a stool and a squealer

Greatly comforted though eager for news of the chase Barney started
on his evenings routine of visiting the gayer restaurants Business is
business and a man suffers when he neglects it True this was a neat
proposition which he had in hand but that would soon be cleaned up and
Businessman Barney desired to be all ready to move forward into further
enterprises



In the meanwhile there had been a session between Maggie and the
Duchess At about the time Barney had whispered his unlipped news to
Gavegan Maggie breathless with her frantic haste though she had made
the journey in a taxicab entered the familiar room behind the pawnshop

Goodevening Maggie The voice was casual indifferent though
at that moment there was no person that the Duchess pondering her
problems more wished to see Sit down Whats the matter

The police know Larry is in New York and are after him

How do you know

Rapidly Maggie told of the happenings in her sittingroom and of Barney
and Old Jimmie starting out to warn Gavegan The Duchess heard every
word but most of her faculties were concentrated upon a reexamination
of Maggie and upon those questions which had been troubling her all
evening and for these many days Was there good in Maggie Was she
justified in longer suppressing the truth of Maggies parentage

Why are you telling me all this the Duchess asked when Maggie had
finished her rapid recital

Why Isnt it plain I want you to get warning to Larry that the police
are after him

Why not do it yourself

Im going out where he is tomorrow but that may be too late

Maggie gave her other reasons such as they were The old womans eyes
never left Maggies flushed face and yet never showed any interest

I thought you were tied up with Barney and Old Jimmie the Duchess
commented Why are you going against them in this and trying to help
Larry

Whats the difference why Im doing it Maggie cried with feverish
impatience so long as Im trying to help him out of this

Dont you realize continued the calm old voice that Larry must
already know as a matter of course that the police and all the old
crowd are after him

Perhaps he does and perhaps he doesnt All the same he should know
for certain The big point is will you get Larry word

A moment passed and the Duchess did not speak In fact this time she had
not heard Maggie so intent was she in trying to look through Maggies
dark eager eyes to the very core of Maggies being

Will you get Larry word Maggie repeated impatiently

The Duchess came out of her study There was a sudden thrill within her
but it did not show in her voice

Yes

At once

As soon as telling him will do any good And now you better hurry back
to your hotel if you dont want Barney and Old Jimmie to suspect what
youve been up to Though why you still want to hang on to that pair
knowing what they are is more than I can guess

She stood up Wait a minute she said as Maggie started for the door
Maggie turned back and for another moment the Duchess silently peered
deep into Maggies eyes Then she said shortly almost sharply At your
age I was twice as pretty as you areand twice as cleverand I played
much the same game Look what I got out of life Goodnight And
abruptly the Duchess wheeled about and mounted the stairway

Twenty minutes later Maggie was back at the Grantham her absence
unobserved Though palpitant over Larrys fate she had the satisfaction
of having achieved with Larrys grandmother what she had set forth to
achieve She did not know could not know that what she had accepted as
her achievement was inconsequential compared to what had actually been
achieved by her spontaneous appearance before the troubled Duchess




CHAPTER XXIX


As the Duchess had gazed into Maggies excited imploring eyes it had
been borne in upon her carefully judging and painfully hesitant mind
that there was better than a fifty per cent chance that Larry was right
in his estimate of Maggie that Maggies inclination toward criminal
adventure her supreme selfconfidence all her bravado were but
the superficial though strong tendencies developed by her unfortunate
environment that within that cynical worldly shell there were the
vital and plastic makings of a real woman

And so the longtroubled Duchess who to her acquaintances had always
seemed as unemotional as the dustcoated motheaten parrot which stood
in mummified aloofness upon her safe had made a momentous decision that
had sent through her old veins the thrilling sap of a great crisis a
great suspense She had tried to guide destiny She was now through
with such endeavor She had no right because of her love for Larry to
withhold longer the facts of Maggies parentage She was now going to
tell the truth and let events work out as they would

But the eventswhat were they going to be

For a moment the Duchess had been impelled to tell the truth straight
out to Maggie But she had caught herself in time This whole affair was
Larrys affair and the truth belonged to him to be used as he saw fit
So when she had told Maggie that she would get word to Larry it was
this truth which she had had in mind and only in a very minor way the
news which Maggie had brought

This was of course such a truth as could be safely communicated only
by word of mouth The Duchess realized that Larry no longer dared come
to her and that therefore she must manage somehow to get to him And
get to him without betraying his whereabouts

There was little chance that the police would search her place or
greatly bother her To the police mind now that Larry was aware he was
known to be in New York the pawnshop would obviously be the last place
in which he would seek refuge or through which he would have dealings
Nevertheless the Duchess deemed it wise to lose no moment and to
neglect no possible caution Therefore while Barney was still with
Chief Barlow and before the general order regarding Larry had more than
reached the various police stations the Duchess in cape hat and
veil was out of her house A block up the street lived the owner of
two or three taxicabs concerning whom the Duchess who was almost
omniscient in her own world knew much that the said owner ardently
desired should be known no further A few sentences with this gentleman
and fifteen minutes later huddled back in the darkened corner of a
taxicab she rolled over the Queensboro Bridge out upon Long Island on
her mission of releasing a fact whose effect she could not foresee



An hour and a half after that Larry was leading her to a bench in
the scented darkness of the Sherwoods lawn She had telephoned Mr
Brandon from a drugstore booth in Flushing and Larry had been waiting
for her near the entrance to Cedar Crest

What brought you out here like this grandmother Larry whispered in
amazement as he sat down beside her

To tell you that the police are after you she whispered back

I knew that already

Yes I knew that you would

But how did you find out

Maggie told me

Maggie

She came down to see me told me what had just happened at her place
told me about Barney hurrying away to slip the news to that Gavegan and
begged me to warn you at once She was terribly nervous and wrought up

Maggie did that he breathed His heart leaped at her unexpected
concern for him Maggie did that And then There wasnt any need
she should have known that I would know

It was rather foolish in a waybut Maggie was too excited to use cool
reason

His grandmother did not speak for a moment Her losing her head and
coming shows that she cares for you Larry

He could make no response This was indeed the clearest evidence Maggie
had yet given that possibly she might care

Maggie may have lost her head in her excitement he managed to say
but grandmother there was no reason for you to lose your head so far
as to come away out here to tell me about the police

I didnt come away out here to tell you about the police she replied
I came to tell you something else

Yes

Youre sure you really care for Maggie

I told you that when I was down to see you this evening

Though the Duchess had decided the desire to protect Larry remained
tenaciously in her and made it hard for her jealous love to take a
risk Youre sure she might turn out all rightthat is under better
influences

Im sure grandmother He recalled how a few hours earlier at the
Grantham the demand of Old Jimmie that she remain with him had seemed
the force that had controlled her decision There would be no doubt of
it if it were not for Old Jimmie and the people hes kept her among
and the ideas hes been feeding her since she was a baby I dont think
she has any love for her father but they say blood is mighty thick and
I guess with her its just the usual instinct of a child to stand with
her father and do what he says Yes if she were not held back and held
down by having Old Jimmie for a father Im sure shed be all right

The Duchess felt that the moment had now arrived for her to unloose
her secret But despite her fixed purpose to tell her words had to be
forced out and were halting bald

Jimmie Carlisleis not her father

Whats that exclaimed Larry

Not so loud I said Jimmie Carlisle is not her father

Grandmother

Her father is Joe Ellison

Grandmother He caught her hands Whywhy But for a moment his
utter dumbfoundment paralyzed his speech Youreyoure sure of that
he finally got out

Yes She went on and told of how her suspicion had been aroused
of her interview with Joe Ellison which had transmuted suspicion into
certainty of her theory of the motives which had actuated Jimmie
Carlisle in so perverting the directions of the man who had held Jimmie
as his most trusted friend

Larry was fairly stunned by this recital of what had been done And he
was further stunned as he realized the fullness of what now seemed to be
the circumstances

God think of it he breathed Maggie trying to be a great
adventuress because she was brought up that way because she thinks her
father wants her to be thatand having never a guess of the truth And
Joe Ellison believing that his daughter is a nice simple girl happily
ignorant of the life he tried to shield her fromand having never
a guess of the truth What a situation And if they should ever find
out

He broke off appalled by the power and magnitude of what he vaguely
saw Presently he said in a numbed awed voice

They should know the truth But how are they to find out

Im leaving all that to you Larry Maggie and Joe Ellison are your
affair Its up to you to decide what you think best to do

Larry was silent for several moments Youve known this for some time
grandmother

For several weeks

Why didnt you tell me before

I was afraid it might somehow bring you closer to Maggie and I didnt
want that she answered honestly Now I think a little better of
Maggie And youve proved to me I can trust a great deal more to your
judgment Yes I guess thats the chief reason Ive come out here to
tell you this youve proved to me Ive got to respect your judgment
And so whatever you may doabout Maggie or anything elsewill be all
right with me

She did not wait for a response but stood up Her voice which had been
shot through with emotion these last few minutes was now that flat
mechanical monotone to which the habitants of her little street were
accustomed

I must be getting back to the city Goodnight

He started to accompany her to her car but she forbade him saying that
it would not help matters to have him seen and possibly recognized by
the taxicab driver and so she went out of the grounds alone Within
another hour and a half she was set down unobserved in a dim side street
in Brooklyn Thence she made her way on foot to the Subway and rode
home If the police had noticed her absence and should question her she
could refuse to answer or say that she had been visiting late with a
friend in Brooklyn

Larry sat long out in the night after his grandmother had left him What
should he do with this amazing information placed at his disposal Tell
Joe Ellison Or tell Maggie Or tell both Or himself try to meet Jimmie
Carlisle and pay that traitor to Joe Ellison and that malformer of
Maggie the coin he had earned

But for hours the situation itself was still too bewildering in its
many phases for Larry to give concentrated thought to what should be
its attempted solution Not until dawn was beginning to awaken dully as
with a protracted yawn out of the shadowy Sound was he able really to
hold his mind with clearness upon the problem of what use he should
make of these facts of which he had been appointed guardian He decided
against telling Joe Ellisonat least he would not tell him yet He
recalled the rumors of Joe Ellisons repressed volcano of a temper if
Joe Ellison should learn how he had been defrauded all the mans vital
forces would be instantly transformed into destructive vengeful rage
that would spare no one and count no cost The result would doubtless
be tragedy with no one greatly served and with Joe very likely back in
prison If he himself should go out to give Old Jimmie his deserts
his action would be just good powder wastedit likewise would serve no
constructive purpose Larry realized that it is only human nature for a
wronged man to wish for and attempt revenge but that in the economy of
life revenge has no value serves no purpose that it usually only makes
a bad situation worse

A tremendous wrong had been done here a wrong which showed a malignant
cunning patient mind But as Larry finally saw the matter the point
for first consideration was not the valueless satisfaction of making the
guilty man suffer but was to try to restore to the victims some part of
those precious things of which they had been unconsciously robbed

And then Larry had what seemed to him an inspiration his inspiration
being only a sane thought and what the Duchess though she had
not pointed the way to him had thought he would do Maggie was
the important person in this situationMaggie whose life was just
beginning and whose nature he still believed to be plastic Not Joe
Ellison or Old Jimmie Carlisle who had almost lived out their lives and
whose natures were now settled into what they would be until the end
By playing upon the finer elements in Maggies character he had all but
succeeded in rousing to dominance that best nature which existed within
her He would privately tell Maggie the truth and tell only her and
leave the using of that knowledge to her alone The shock of that
knowledge the effect of its revelations upon her together with the
responsibility of what she should do with this information might be
just the final forces necessary to make Maggie break away from all that
she had been and swing over to all that he believed she might be

Yes that was the thing to do And he would do it within the next twelve
hours for Dick had told him that Maggie was coming out again to Cedar
Crest on the afternoon of the day which was now rousing from its sleep
That is he would do it if the police or the allies of his onetime
friends did not locate him before Maggie came But of that he had no
serious fear he knew he had made a clean getaway from the Grantham
and that the shrewd Duchess had left no scent by which those bloodhounds
of the Police Department could trail her

Larry did not even try to sleep he knew it would be of no avail Back
in his own room he sat going over the situation and his decision He
tingled with the sense of the tremendous power which had been delivered
into his hands Yes tremendous But what were going to be Maggies
reactions the moment he told herjust what would be her course after
she knew the truth




CHAPTER XXX


Larry undressed had a bath shaved dressed again and started to
work But that day the most Larry did was abstractedly going through
the motions of work He was completely filled with the situation and its
many questions and with the suspense of waiting for Maggie to come and
of how he was going to manage to see her privately

The meeting however proved no difficulty for Maggie who arrived at
four had come primarily on Larrys account and she herself maneuvered
the encounter While they were on the piazza Dick having gone into the
house for a fresh supply of cigarettes and Miss Sherwood being in an
animated discussion with Hunt Maggie said

Miss Sherwood Ive never had a real look down at the Sound from the
edge of your bluff Do you mind if Mr Brandon shows me

Not at all Tea wont be served for half an hour so take your time
Have Mr Brandon show you the view from just the other side of that old
rosebench thats the best view

They walked away chatting mechanically until they were in a garden seat
behind the rosebench The rosebench was a rather sorry affair for
it had been set out in this exposed place by a former gardener who had
forgotten that the direct winds from the Sound are malgracious to
roses However it screened the two and was far enough removed so that
ordinary tones would not carry to the house

Did your grandmother get you word about the police Maggie asked with
suppressed excitement as soon as they were seated

Yes She came out here about midnight

Then why while you still had time didnt you get farther away from
New York than this

If Im to be caught Im to be caught in the meantime this is as safe
a place as any other for me Besides I wanted to have at least one more
talk with youafter something new grandmother told me about you

Something new about me echoed Maggie startled by his grave tone
What

About your father he said watching closely for the effect upon her
of his revelations

What about my father Whats he been doing that I dont know about

You do not know a single thing that your father has done

What

Because you do not know who your father is

What she gasped

Listen Maggie What Im going to tell you may seem unbelievable but
youve got to believe it because its the truth I can see that you
have proofs if you want proofs But you can accept what I tell you as
absolute facts You are by birth a very different person from what you
believe yourself Your father is not Jimmie Carlisle And your mother

Larry She tensely gripped his arm

Your mother was of a good family I imagine something like Miss
Sherwoods kindthough not so rich and not having such social standing
She died when you were born She never knew what your fathers business
actually was he passed for a country gentleman He was about the
smoothest and biggest crook of his time and a straight crook if there
is such a thing

Larry she breathed

He kept this gentlemanfarmer side of his life and his marriage
entirely hidden from his crook acquaintances that is from all except
one whom he trusted as his most loyal friend Before you were old enough
to remember he was tripped up and sent away on a twentyyear sentence

And heshes still in prison whispered Maggie

Larry did not heed the interruption He had developed the highest kind
of ambition for you He wanted you to grow up a fine simple woman like
your mothersomething like Miss Sherwood He did not want you ever
to know the sort of life he had known and he did not want you to be
handicapped by the knowledge that you had a crook for a father He still
had intact your mothers fortune a small one but an honest one So
he put you and the money in the hands of his trusted friend with the
instructions that you were to be brought up as the girls of the nicest
families are brought up and believing yourself an orphan

That friend of his Larry she whispered tensely

Jimmie Carlisle

Ooh

I dont know what Jimmie Carlisles motives were for what he has done
Perhaps to get your money perhaps some grudge against your father
which he was afraid to show while your father was free for your
father was always his master But Old Jimmie has brought you up exactly
contrary to the orders he received If revenge was Old Jimmies motive
his cunning cowardly brain could not have conceived a more diabolical
revenge one that would hurt your father more Till a few years ago
when word was sent to your father that Old Jimmie was dead Jimmie
regularly wrote your father about the success of his plan about how
splendidly you were developing and getting on with the best people And
your fatherI knew him in prisonnow believes you have grown up into
exactly the kind of young woman he planned

Larry she choked in a numbed voice Larry

Your father is now as happy as it is possible for him to be for he has
lived for years and still lives in the belief that his great dream the
only big thing left for him to do has come to pass that somewhere out
in the world is his daughter grown into a nice simple wholesome young
woman with a clean wholesome life before her And though she is the
one thing in all the world to him he never intends to see her again for
fear that his seeing her might somehow result in an accident that would
destroy her happy ignorance Maggie can you conceive the tremendous
meaning to your father of what he believes he has created And can you
conceive the tremendous difference between the dream he lives upon and
the reality

She was white staring wilted For once all the defiance
selfconfidence bravado melted out of her and she was just an
appalled and frightened young girl

After a moment she managed to repeat the question Larry had ignored Is
my real fatherstill in prison

Youd like to see your real father he asked her

I thinkId like to have a glimpse of him she breathed

Larry just before this had noted Joe Ellison in his blue overalls and
wide straw hat cleaning out a bank of young dahlias a distance up the
bluff He now took Maggies arm and guided her in that direction

See that man there working among the dahliasthe man who once brought
you a bunch of roses Joe Ellison is his name Hes the man Ive been
talking aboutyour father

He felt her quivering under his hand for a moment and heard her breath
come in swift spasmodic pants He was wondering what was the effect
upon her of this climax of his revelation when she whispered

Do you supposeI can speakto my father

Of course He likes all young women And I told you that he and I were
close friends

Thencome on She arose clinging to him and drew him after her
Halfway to Joe she breathed You please say something first Anything

He recognized this as the appeal of one whose faculties were reeling
There had never been any attempt here at Cedar Crest to conceal Joe
Ellisons past and in Larrys case there had been only such concealment
as might help his evasion of his dangers And so Larry remarked as Joe
Ellison took his wide hat off his white hair and stood bareheaded before
them

Joe Miss Cameron knows who I really am and about my having been in
Sing Sing and Ive just told her about our having been friends there
Also I told her about your having a daughter It interested her and she
asked me if she couldnt talk to you so I brought her over

Larry stood aside and tensely watched this meeting between father and
daughter Joe bowed slightly and with a dignified grace that overalls
and over fifteen years of prison could not take from one who during
his early and middle manhood had been known as the perfection of the
finished gentleman His gray eyes warmed with appreciation of the young
figure before him just as Larry had seen them grow bright watching the
young figures disporting in the Sound

It is very gracious for a young woman like you Miss Cameron he said
in a voice of grave courtesy to be interested enough in an old man
like me to want to talk with him

Maggie made the supreme effort of her life to keep herself in hand
I wanted to talk to you because of something Mr Brainard told me
aboutabout your having a daughter

Larry felt that this was too sacred a scene for him to intrude upon
Would you mind excusing me he said there are some calculations Ive
got to rush outand he returned to the bench on which they had been
sitting and pretended to busy himself over a pocket notebook

While Larry had been speaking and moving away Maggie had swiftly
been appraising her father His gray eyes were direct as against the
furtiveness of Jimmies his mouth had a firm kindliness as against the
wrinkled cunning of Jimmies his bearing was erect selfpossessed
as against Jimmies bent shuffling carriage Maggie felt no swiftborn
daughter love for this stranger who was her father The turmoil of her
discovery filled her too completely to admit a fullgrown affection but
she thrilled with the sense of the vast difference between her supposed
father and this her real father

In the meantime her father had spoken Joe would have been more reserved
with men or with older women but with this girl so much the sort of
girl he had long dreamed about his reserve vanished without resistance
and in its place was a desire to talk to this beautiful creature who
came out of the world which the big white house represented

I have a daughter yes he said But LarryMr Brainard perhaps I
should sayhas likely told you all there is to tell

Id like to hear it from you pleaseif you dont mind

Theres really not much to tell he said You know what I was and
what happened When I went to prison my daughter was too young to
remember meless than two years old I didnt want her ever to be drawn
into the sort of life that had been mine or be the sort of woman that a
girl becomes who gets into that life And I didnt want her ever to have
the stigma and the handicap of her knowing and the world knowing that
her father was a convict You cant understand it fully Miss Cameron
but perhaps you can understand a little how disgraced you would feel
what a handicap it would be if your father were a convict I had a good
friend I could trust So I turned my daughter over to him to be
brought up with no knowledge of my existence and with every reasonable
advantage that a nice girl should have I guess thats all Miss
Cameron

This friendwhat was his name

CarlisleJimmie Carlisle But his name could never have meant anything
to you Besides hes dead now

Maggie forced herself on Your planit turned out all right And
youyou are happy

Yes In the sympathetic atmosphere which this young girls presence
created for him Joes emotions flowed into words more freely than ever
before in the company of a human being Though he was answering her
what he was really doing was rather just letting his heart use its
longsilent voice speak its exultant dream and belief

Somewhere out in the worldI dont know where and I dont want to
knowmy daughter has now grown into a wholesome splendid young woman
he said in a vibrant voice Brooding in solitude so long upon his
careful plan that he believed could not fail had made the keen Joe
Ellison less suspicious concerning it than he otherwise would have
beenperhaps had made him a bit daffy on this one subject I have
saved my daughter from all the grime she might have known and which
might have soiled her and even pulled her down if I hadnt thought
out in good time my plan to protect her And of course I am happy he
exulted I have done the best thing that it was possible for me to
do the thing which I wanted most to do Instead of what she might have
been I have as a daughter just such a nice girl as you arejust about
your own agethough of course she hasnt your money your social
position and naturally not quite the advantages you have had Of course
Im happy

Youreyoure sure shes all that

Again his words were as much a statement aloud to himself of his
constant dream as they were a direct answer to Maggie Of course There
was enough moneythe plan was in the hands of a friend who knew how
to handle such a thingshes never known anything but the very best
surroundingsand until she was fourteen I had regular reports on how
wonderfully she was progressing You see my friend had had her legally
adopted by a splendid family so theres no doubt about everything being
for the best

And youMaggie drove herself ondont you ever want to see her

Of course I do But at the very beginning I fixed things so I could
not so that I would not even know where she is Removed temptation from
myself you see Dont you see the possible results if I should try to
see her Something might happen that would bring out the truth and that
would ruin her happiness her career Dont you see

His gray eyes bright with his great dream were fixed intently upon
Maggie and yet she felt that they were gazing far beyond her at some
other girl at his girl

II she gulped and swayed and would have fallen if he had not been
quick to catch her arm

You are sick Miss he asked anxiously

II have been she stammered trying to regain control of her
faculties Itsits thatand my not eatingand standing in this
hot sun Thank you very much for what youve told me IdId better be
getting back

Ill help you And very gently with a firm hand under one arm he
escorted her to the bench where Larry sat scribbling nothings He then
raised his hat and returned to his dahlias

Well queried Larry when they were alone

I cant stand it to stay here and talk to these people she replied
in an agonized whisper I must get away from here quick so that I can
think

May I come with you

No LarryI must be alone Please Larry please get into the house
and manage to fake a telephone message for me calling me back to New
York at once

All right And Larry hurried away She sat pale breathing rapidly
her whole being clenched staring fixedly out at the Sound Five minutes
later Larry was back

Its all arranged Maggie Ive told the people theyre sorry youve
got to go And Dick is getting his car ready

She turned her eyes upon him He had never seen in them such a look
They were feverish with a dazed affrighted horror She clutched his
arm

You must promise never to tell my father about me

I wont Unless I have to

But you must not Never she cried desperately He thinks ImOh
dont you understand If he were to learn what I really am it would
kill him He must keep his dream For his sake he must never find out
he must keep on thinking of me just the same Now you understand

Larry slowly nodded

Her next words were dully vibrant with stricken awe And it means that
I can never have him for my father Never And I thinkIdId like
him for a father Dont you see

Again Larry nodded In this entirely new phase of her a whitefaced
stricken shivering girl Larry felt a poignant sympathy for her the
like of which had never tingled through him in her conquering moods
Indeed Maggies situation was opening out into great human problems such
as neither he nor any one else had ever foreseen

There comes Dick she whispered I must do my best to hold myself
together Goodbye Larry

A minute later Larry just behind her she was crossing the lawn on
Dicks arm explaining her weakness and pallor by the sudden dizziness
which had come upon her in consequence of not eating and of being in the
hot sun




CHAPTER XXXI


Larry was far more deeply moved this time when Maggie drove away
with Dick than on that former occasion when he had tried to play with
adroitness upon her psychological reactions Now he knew that her very
world was shaken that her soul was stunned and reeling that she was
fighting with all her strength for a brief outward composure

He had loved her for months but he had never so loved her as in this
hour when all her artificial defenses had been battered down and she had
been just a bewildered agonized girl with just the emotions and
first thoughts that any other normal girl would have had under the same
circumstances His great desire had been to be with her to comfort her
help her but he realized that she had been correct in her instinct to
be by herself for a while to try to comprehend it all to try to think
her way out

When Maggie was out of sight he excused himself from having tea left
Hunt and Miss Sherwood upon the veranda and sought his study But
though he had neglected his work the whole day he now gave it no
attention He sat at his desk and thought of Maggie tried to think
of what she was going to do Her situation was so complicated with big
elements which she would have to handle that he could not foretell just
what her course would be It was a terrific situation for a young woman
who was after all just a very young girl to face alone But there was
nothing for him but to wait for news from her And she had not said even
that she would ever let him hear

While he considered these matters he had risen and paced the room Once
he had paused at a French window which opened upon a side veranda and
had seen below him a few yards away Joe Ellison whose interest in his
flowers had established his workday from sunrise to sunset Joe Ellison
had been pulling tiny weeds that were daring to attempt to get a start
in a rosegarden Larrys mind had halted a moment upon Joe Here at
least was a contented man one who no matter what happened would
remain in ignorance of possibly great events which would intimately
concern him Then Larry had left the window and had returned to his
thoughts of Maggie

But Larrys thoughts were not to remain exclusively with Maggie for
long Shortly after six Judkins entered and announced that a man was at
the door with a message The man had refused to come in saying he was
only a messenger and was in a hurry and had refused to give Judkins
the message saying that it was verbal Thinking that some word had come
from his grandmother or possibly even from Maggie Larry went out upon
the veranda Waiting for him was a nondescript man he did not know

Mr Brandon sir asked the man

Yes You have a message for me

Before the man could reply there came a shout from the shrubbery beyond
the drive

Grab him Smith Hes the man

Instantly Smiths steely arms were about Larry pinning his elbows to
his sides and a man broke from the shrubbery and hurried toward the
house Instinctively Larry started to struggle but he ceased as he
recognized the man coming up the steps It was Gavegan Larry realized
that he had been shrewdly trapped that resistance would serve no end
and the next moment handcuffs were upon his wrists

Well Brainard gloated Gavegan weve landed you at last

So it seems Gavegan

You thought you was damned clever but I guess you know now you aint
one two three

Oh I knew how clever you are Gavegan Larry responded dryly and
that youd get me sooner or later if I hung around

As a matter of fact Larrys capture which was as unspectacular as his
escape had been strenuous was the consequence of no cleverness at
all Larry had said to Barney Palmer the night before that he knew who
Barneys sucker was and Barney had passed this information along to
Chief Barlow Follow every clue luck may be with you and one of the
clues may turn up what you wantthis is in substance an unwritten
rule of routine procedure which effects those magnificent police
solutions which are presented as more mysterious than the original
mysteryfor it is well for the public to believe that its police
officers are unfailingly more clever than its criminals Barlow had
done some routine thinking if Larry Brainard knew Dick Sherwood was
the sucker then watching Dick Sherwood might possibly reveal the
whereabouts of Larry Brainard Barlow had passed this tip along to
Gavegan Gavegan had grumbled to himself that it was only a thousand to
one shot but luck had been with him and his long shot had won

Miss Sherwood Hunt behind her had been drawn by the sound of voices
around to the side of the veranda where stood the four men What are
you doing she now sharply demanded of Gavegan

Dont like to make any unpleasant scene Miss Sherwood but Ive gotta
tell you that this socalled Brandon is a wellknown crook Gavegan
enjoyed few things more than astounding people with unpleasant facts
His real name is Brainard hes done time and now hes wanted by the
New York police for a tough job he pulled

I knew all that long ago said Miss Sherwood

Ehwhat stammered Gavegan

Mr Brainard told me all that the first time I saw him

Hello Gavegan said Hunt stepping forward

Well Ill beif you aint that crazy Again the ability to express
himself coherently and with restraint failed Gavegan If you aint that
painter that lived down at the Duchesss

Right Gaveganas a detective always should be And Larry Brainard was
then and is now my friend

Miss Sherwood again spoke up sharply Mr Gaveganif that is your
nameyou will please take those foolish things off Mr Brainards
wrists

Gavegan had been cheated out of creating a sensation That discomfiture
perhaps made him even more dogged than he was by nature

Sorry Miss but hes charged with having committed a crime and is a
fugitive from justice and I cant

Ill be his security Take them off

Sorry to refuse you again Miss But hes a dangerous mangot away
once before My orders is to take no risks thatll give him another
chance for a getaway

Miss Sherwood turned to Larry Ill go into town with you and so will
Mr Hunt Ill see that you get bail and a good lawyer

Thank you Miss Sherwood Larry said Gavegan I guess were ready to
start

Not just yet Brainard Sorry Miss Sherwood but weve got a search
warrant for your place We just want to have a look at the room Brainard
used No telling what kind of crooked stuff hes been up to And to make
the search warrant OK I had it issued in this county and brought along
a county officer to serve it Show it to the lady Smith

I have no desire to see it Mr Gavegan I have more interest in
watching you while you go through my things And giving Gavegan a look
which made an unaccustomed flush run up that officers thick neck and
redden his square face she led the way into Larrys study This is
the room where Mr Brainard works she said Through that door is his
bedroom Everything here except his clothing is my property I shall
hold you rigidly responsible for any disorder you may create or any
damage you may do Now you may go ahead

Lets have all your keys Brainard Gavegan choked out

Larry handed them over With Miss Sherwood Hunt and Larry looking
silently on the two men began their examination They began with the
papers on Larrys desk and in its drawers and in all his life Gavegan
had not been so considerate in a search as he now was with Miss
Sherwoods blue eyes coldly upon him They unlocked cabinets
scrutinized their contents shook out books examined the backs of
pictures took up rugs then passed into Larrys bedroom Miss Sherwood
made no move to follow the officers into that more intimate apartment
and the other two watchers remained with her

A minute passed Then Gavegan reentered a puzzled halftriumphant look
on his red face holding out a square of paintcovered canvas

Found this thing in Brainards chiffonier What the heI mean whats
it doing out here

There was not an instants doubt as to what the thing was Larry
started and Hunt started and Miss Sherwood started But it was Miss
Sherwood who first spoke

Why its a portrait of Miss Cameron in costume And painted by Mr
Hunt In amazement she turned first upon Larry and upon Hunt When did
you ever paint her portrait when you did not meet Miss Cameron till
you met her here And Mr Brainard how do you come to possess Miss
Camerons portrait

It was Gavegan who spoke up promptly and not either of the two suddenly
discomfited men And Gavegan instantly sensed in the situation a chance
to get even for the humiliation his selfesteem had just suffered

Miss Cameron nothing Her real name is Maggie Carlisle and she used
to live at a dump of a pawnshop down on the East Side run by Brainards
grandmother Brainard knew her there and so did Mr Hunt

Butbut gasped Miss Sherwoodshes been coming out here as Maggie
Cameron

I tell you your Maggie Cameron is Maggie Carlisle said Gavegan
gloatingly Ive known her for years Her father is Old Jimmie
Carlisle a notorious crook And shes mixed up right now with her
father and some others in a crooked game And Brainard here used to be
sweet on her and probably still is and if hes been letting her come
here without telling you who she iswell I guess you know the answer
Didnt I tell you Miss that give me a chance and Id turn up something
against this guy Brainard

Miss Sherwoods face was white but set with grim accusation that was
only waiting to pronounce swift judgment Mr Hunt is it true that
Miss Cameron is this Maggie Carlisle the officer mentions and that you
knew it all the while

Yes began the painter

Dont blame him Miss Sherwood Larry interrupted He didnt tell you
because I begged him not to as a favor to me Blame me for everything

Her judgment upon Hunt was pronounced with cold finality her eyes
straight into Hunts Whatever may have been Mr Hunts motives I
unalterably hold him to blame

She turned upon Larry The face which he had only seen in gracious moods
was as inflexibly stern as a prosecuting attorneys

Were going to go right to the bottom of this Mr Brainard You
too have known all along that this Miss Cameron was really the Maggie
Carlisle this officer speaks of

Yes

And you have known all along that she was the daughter of this
notorious criminal Old Jimmie Carlisle

The impulse surged up in Larry to tell the newly learned truth about
Maggie But he remembered Maggies injunction that the truth must never
be known He checked his revelation just in time

Yes

And is it true that Maggie Carlisle is herself what is known as a
crookor has had crooked inclinations or plans

Its like this Miss Sherwood

A direct answer please

Yes

And is it true as this officer has suggested that you were in love
with her yourself

Yes

You are aware of my brothers infatuation for her That he has asked
her to marry him

Yes

Her voice now sounded more terrible to Larry I took you in to give you
a chance And your repayment has been that knowing all these things
you have kept silent and let me and my brother be imposed upon by a
swindling operation And who knows since you admit that you love
the girl that you have not been a partner in the conspiracy from the
first

Thats exactly the idea Miss put in Gavegan

Larry had foreseen many possible wrong turns which his plan might take
but he was appalled by the utter unexpectedness of the actual disaster
And yet he recognized that the evidence justified Miss Sherwoods
judgment of him It all made him seem an ingrate and a swindler

For the moment Larry was so overwhelmed that he made no attempt to
speak And since for once Gavegan was content merely to gloat over his
triumph there was stiff silence in the room until Miss Sherwood said
in the cold voice of a judge after a jury has brought in a verdict of
guilty

Of course if you think there is anything you may say for yourself Mr
Brainard you now have the chance to say it

I have much to say but I cant blame you if you refuse to believe
most of it Larry said desperately fighting for what seemed his last
chance I loved Maggie Carlisle I believed she had splendid qualities
Only she was dominated by the twisted ideas Old Jimmie Carlisle had
planted in her I wanted to eradicate those twisted ideas and make
her good qualities her ruling ones But she didnt believe in me
She thought me a softhead a police stool a squealer Then I had to
disappear you know all about that Not till I had been with you for
several weeks did I learn that she was being used in a swindling scheme
against Dick

I did think of telling you or Dick But my greatest interest was to
awaken that better person I believed to be in her and I knew that the
certain result of my exposing her to you would be for me to lose the
last bit of influence I had with her and for her to pass right on to
another enterprise of similar character So the idea came to me that if
I didnt expose her but caused her to be received with every courtesy
by her intended victims the effect upon her would be that she would
feel a revulsion for what she was doing and she would come to her best
senses I told this to Mr Hunt thats why he agreed not to give her
away And another point though frankly this was not so important to me
it seemed to me that a good hard jolt might be just what was needed to
make Dick take life more seriously and I saw in this affair a chance
for Dick to get just the jolt he needed

Thats all Miss Sherwood Except that I have seen signs which make me
believe that what I figured would happen to Maggie Carlisle have begun
to happen to her

Bunk snorted Gavegan

I know that part of what he says is true put in Hunt

Miss Sherwood ignored Hunt and his remark The look of controlled wrath
which she held upon Larry did not change Larry recognized that his
statement had sounded most implausible Miss Sherwood in her indignation
considered only that her kindness had been betrayed her hospitality
outraged and that those she had accepted as friends had sought to
trick her family in the worst way she could conceive and she spoke
accordingly

If that is the best Mr Brainard has to say for himself Mr Gavegan
you may take him with you and without any interference from me I ask
only that you take him out of the house at once

With that she moved from the room not looking again at either Hunt
or Larry For a brief space there was silence while Gavegan let his
triumph feed gloatingly upon the sight of his prisoner

This brief silence was broken by a low strange sound like a human
cry quickly repressed that seemed to come from just outside the French
windows

What was that Larry asked quickly

I didnt hear anything said Gavegan whose senses had been thoroughly
concentrated upon his triumph

I did said Hunt On the veranda

Well see Watch him to the county officer and Gavegan followed
Hunt to the French windows and looked out No one on the veranda and
no one in sight he reported You fellows must have been dreaming

He returned and faced Larry I guess youll admit Brainard that Ive
got you for keeps this time

Then suppose we be starting for Headquarters Larry responded

Hunt moved to Larrys side Ill just trail along after you Larry
Anyhow this doesnt seem to be any place for me

A few minutes afterwards Larry was in a car beside Gavegan speeding
away from Cedar Crest toward the city Larrys thoughts were the
gloomiest he had entertained since he had come out of Sing Sing months
before with his great dream All that he had counted on had gone wrong
He was in the hands of the police and he knew how hard the police would
be He had incurred the hostility of Miss Sherwood and had lost what had
seemed a substantial opportunity to start his career as an honest man
The only item of his great plan in which he did not seem to have failed
completely was Maggie And he did not know what Maggie was going to do




CHAPTER XXXII


When Maggie drove away with Dick from Cedar Crestthis was an hour
before Gavegan descended out of the blue upon Larry and two hours before
he rode triumphantly away with his captiveshe was the most dazed and
disillusioned young creature who had ever set out confidently to conquer
the world Courage confidence quickness of wit all the qualities on
which she had prided herself were now entirely gone and she was just
a white limp figure that wanted to run away a weak figure in which
swirled thoughts almost too spasmodically powerful for so weakened a
vessel not to be shattered under their wild strain thoughts of her
amazingly discovered real fatherof how she was the very contradiction
of her fathers dreamof Larryof the cunning Jimmie Carlisle whom
till this day she had believed her fatherof Barney Palmer

So agitated was she with these gyrating thoughts that she was not
conscious that Dick had stopped the car on the green roadside until
he had taken her hand and had begun to speak The happy garrulous
unobservant Dick had not noticed anything out of the way with her more
than a pallor which she had explained away as being due to nothing more
than a bit of temporary dizziness And so for the second time Dick now
poured out his love to her and asked her to marry him

Dont Dickplease she interrupted him I cant marry you Never

What cried the astounded Dick Maggiewhy not

I cant Thats final And dont make me talk to you now Dickplease
I cannot

His face so fresh and happy the moment before became gray and lined
with pain But he silently swung the car back into the road

She forgot him utterly in what was happening within her As they rode
on she forced herself to think of what she should do She saw herself
as the victim of much and as guilty of much And then inspiration came
upon her or perhaps it was merely a high frenzy of desperation and she
saw that the responsibility for the whole situation was upon her alone
she saw it as her duty the role assigned her to try to untangle alone
this tangled situation to try to measure out justice to every one

First of all as she had told Larry her fathers dream of her must
remain unbroken Whatever she did she must do nothing that might
possibly be a sharp blow to the conception of his daughter which were
the roots and trunk and flowering branches of his present happiness 
And then came a real inspiration She would in time make herself into
the girl he believed hermake his dream the truth She would get rid of
Old Jimmie and Barneywould cut loose from everything pertaining to her
former lifewould disappear and live for a year or two in the kind of
environment in which he believed he had placed herand would reappear
and claim him for her father And for his own sake he should never know
the truth Two years more and he should have the actuality where he now
had only the dream

But before she was free to enter upon this plan before she could vanish
out of the knowledge of all who had known her there was a great duty to
Larry Brainard which she must discharge He was hunted by the police
he was hunted by his former pals And he was in his predicament
fundamentally because of her Therefore it was her foremost duty to
clear Larry Brainard

Yes she would do that first Somehow

She was considering this problem of how she was to clear Larry who
had tried to awaken her who had shielded her who loved her when Dick
slowed his car down in front of the Grantham and helped her out As he
said a subdued goodbye and was stepping back into his car an impulse
surged up into heran impulse of this different Maggie whose birth was
being attended by such bewildering emotions and decisions

Dick wont you please come up for just a little while

Three minutes later they were in her sittingroom Cap in hand Dick
awaited her words in the misery of silence Her look was drawn but
direct

Back in the road Dick you asked me why I couldnt marry you I asked
you up here to tell you

Yes he queried dully

One reason is that though I like you I dont like you that way The
more important reason to you is that I am a fraud

A fraud he exclaimed incredulously

It had come to her as she was leaving the car that the place to start
her new life was to start right or quit right with Dick A fraud
she repeatedan impostor There is no Maggie Cameron I am born of no
good family from the West I have no money I have always lived in New
Yorkmost of the time down on the East Side I used to work in a Fifth
Avenue millinery shop Till three months ago I sold cigarettes in one of
the big hotels

What of that cried Dick

That is the nicest part of what I have to tell you she continued
relentlessly My supposed relatives Jimmie Carlisle and Barney Palmer
are no relatives at all but are two clever confidence men I have been
in with them working on a scheme they have framed Everything I have
seemed to be everything I have done even this expensive apartment
have all been parts of that scheme The idea of that scheme was to
swindle some rich man out of a lot of moneythrough my playing on his
susceptibilities

Maggie he gasped

More concretely the idea was to trick some rich man into falling in
love with me to get him to propose then to have me confess that I was
already married but to a man who would give me a divorce if he were
paid enough The rich man would then drive a bargain with my supposed
husband pay over a lot of moneyafter which Barney Old Jimmie and I
would disappear with our profits

Maggie he repeated stupefied with his incredulous amazement But the
unflinching gaze she held upon him convinced him she was speaking the
truth Then if that was your game why are you telling me now Why
didnt you say yes when I proposed a week ago I would have fallen for
the game you would have succeeded

Not till that moment did Maggie realize the full truth not till then
did she realize the solid influence Larry Brainard had been in the
background of her life all these months

I didnt go through with it because of Larry Brainard

Larry Brainard His astonishment increased You know Larry Brainard
then

Ive known him for several years

And youve been coming out and hes been pretending not to know you
Of course I knew what Larry Brainard has been But is he in this too

No Hes exactly what you think him From the start hes been trying to
keep me out of this He was behind my coming to your house hes told me
so His reason for getting me there was his belief that my being treated
by you and your sister as I was would make me ashamed of myself and
make me want to quit what I was doing And I thinkI think he was
rightpartly

And Larryhes the reason youre telling me now

I think so But there are other reasons Making a clean breast of
things though she was she felt she dared not trust Dick with the
secret of her father II wanted to clear things up as far as I was
responsible Thats one reason Im telling you There was the chance
you might sometime find out that Larry had known me and suspect him I
wanted you to know the truth of what hed really done And I wanted to
tell you the truth about myself so youd despise and forget me instead
of perhaps carrying around romantic delusions about me after Ive
gone And theres another reason Id like to tell youfor youve been
everything thats fine to meif it wont offend you

Go on he said huskily

Barney Palmer picked you out as the victimyou didnt know you were
being picked outbecause he said that you were an easy mark That you
took things for exactly what they pretended to be and didnt care
what you did with your money That you never would settle down into a
responsible person Im telling you all this Dick because I dont want
you to be what Barney said

Dick slumped into a chair at last beaten down by this cumulative
revelation He buried his face in his hands and his panting breath was
convulsive with unuttered sobs Maggie looked down upon the young boy
with pity remorse and an increasing recognition of the widespread
suffering she had wrought

To think that this has all been horrible makebelieve he at last
groaned That all the while Ive been looked on as just a young fool
who would always remain a fool

Maggie in her sense of guilt was helpless to make any reply that would
soften his agony and for a space neither spoke

Presently Dick stood suddenly up His face was still marked by
suffering but somehow it seemed to have grown older without losing its
youth There was a new blaze of determination in the direct look he held
on Maggie

You say you have never loved me he demanded

She shook her head But Ive told you that Ive always liked you

Larry Brainards doing what he has kept on doing for youthat means
that he loves you doesnt it he pressed on

He has told me so

And you love him

What difference does that makesince I am going away as soon as I get
everything Im wholly or partly responsible for cleared up

If Larry Brainard has known you for a long while then how about Barney
Palmer and Jimmie Carlisle

Theyve known me as long or longer

Then you must have all known each other

Yes Years ago Larry worked with Barney and Jimmie Carlisle

What was the attitude of those two toward Larry when he was trying to
balk them by making you give up the plan

They hated him They are the causeespecially Barneyof all of
Larrys trouble with the police and with the old crowd hes quit To try
to clear Larry thats the most important thing Im going to try to do

And thats where youve got to let me help you Dick cried with sudden
energy Larrys been a mighty good friend to mehes tried to head me
rightand I owe him a lot And Id like a chance to show that Barney
Palmer Im not going to keep on being the eternal fool he sized me up to
be

Maggie was startled by this swift transformation Whywhy Dick she
breathed

Whats your plan to clear Larry

I hadnt got so far as to have a clear plan I had only just realized
that there had to be a plan But since they have set the police on
Larry it came to me that the idea behind any plan would be for the
police to really capture Barney and Jimmie Carlisleget them out of
Larrys way

Thats it Dick Sherwood had a mind which given an interesting
stimulus could work swiftly and it worked swiftly now They were
planning to trim me Lets use that plan you outlined to meuse it
tonight You can tell them some story which will make immediate action
seem necessary and well all get together this evening Ill play my
part all rightdont you worry about me Ill come with a roll of
money that Ill dig up somewhere and itll be marked money When its
passedbingoa couple of detectives that well have planted to watch
the proceedings will step right up and nab the two

She was taken aback by the very idea of him the victim after
her confession throwing his lot in with her Why Dickshe
stammeredto think of you offering to do such a thing

I owe that much to Larry Brainard he declared Andand I owe that
much to your desire to help set him straight Well what about my plan

Since he seemed eager to lend himself to it it seemed to her altogether
wonderful and she told him so They discussed details for several
minutes for there was much to be done and it had all to be done most
adroitly It was agreed that he should come at ten oclock when the
stage would all be set

As he was leaving to attend to his part of the play a precautionary
idea flashed upon Maggie

Better telephone me just before you come Something may have happened
to change our plans

All rightIll telephone Just keep your nerve

With that he hurried out At about the time he left Larry was leaving
Cedar Crest in handcuffs beside the burly and triumphant Gavegan and
believing that the power he had sought to exercise was now effectually
at an end He was out of it In his despondency it was not granted him
to see that the greatest thing which he could do was already done that
he had set in motion all the machinery of what had taken place and
what was about to take place that all the figures in the action of the
further drama of that night were to act as they were to do primarily
because of promptings which came from him




CHAPTER XXXIII


Dicks departure left Maggie to think alone upon an intricate and
possibly dangerous interplay of characters in which she had cast herself
for the chief role which might prove a sacrificial role for her She
quickly perceived that Dicks plan clever as it might be would bring
about in the dubious event of its success only one of the several
happenings which had to come to pass if she were to clear her slate
before her disappearance

Dicks plan was good but it would only get rid of Barney and Old
Jimmie It would only rid Larry of such danger as they represented it
would only be revenge upon them for the evil they had done And after
all revenge helped a man forward but very little There would still
remain even in the event of the success of Dicks plan the constant
danger to Larry from the police hunt instigated by Chief Barlows
vindictive determination to send Larry back to prison for his refusal to
be a stoolpigeon and the constant danger from his onetime friends who
were hunting him down with deadly hatred as a squealer

Somehow if she were to set things right for Larry she had to maneuver
that nights happenings in such a way as to eliminate forever Barlows
persecutions and eliminate forever the danger to Larry from his
friends and their hirelings desire for vengeance upon a supposed
traitor

Maggie thought rapidly elaborating on Dicks plan But what Maggie did
was not so much the result of sober thought as of the inspiration of a
desperate hardly pressed young woman but then after all what we call
inspiration is only thought geared to an incredibly high speed First
of all she got rid of that slowwitted awesome supernumerary Miss
Grierson who might completely upset the delicate action of the stage
by a dignified entrance at the wrong moment and with the wrong cue Next
she called up Chief Barlow at Police Headquarters Fortunately for her
Barlow was still in for an acrimonious dispute then in progress and
taking much space in the public prints between him and the District
Attorneys office was keeping him late at his desk despite the most
autocratic and pleasant of all demands those of his dinner hour To
him Maggie gave a false name and told him that she had most important
information to communicate at once to which he growled back that she
could give it if she came down at once

Next she called up Barney who had been waiting near a telephone in
expectation of news of the result of her second visit to the home of
Dick Sherwood To Barney she said that she had the greatest possible
newsnews which would require immediate actionand that he should be
at her suite at nine oclock prepared to play his part at once in the
big proposition that had just developed and that he should get word to
Old Jimmie to follow him in a few minutes

Within fifteen minutes a taxicab had whirled her down to Police
Headquarters and she was in the office where three months earlier Larry
had been grilled after his refusal of the license to steal and cheat on
the condition that he become a police stool Barlow who was alone in
the room looked up with a scowl from a secret report he had secured of
the activities of detectives in the District Attorneys office Although
Maggie was pretty and stylishly dressed Barlow did not rise nor did he
remove the big cigar he had been viciously gnawing It is the tradition
of the Police Department the most thoroughly respected article of its
religion that a woman who is seen in Police Headquarters cannot by any
possibility be a lady

Well whats on your chest he grunted not even asking her to be
seated

It was suddenly Maggies impulsesprung perhaps out of unconscious
memory of what Larry had sufferedto inflict upon herself the uttermost
humiliation So she said

Ive come here to offer myself as a stoolpigeon

Whats that Barlow exclaimed startled It was not often that a swell
ladywho of course couldnt be a swell he did not know who Maggie
wasvoluntarily walked into his office with such a proposition

I can give you some real information about a big game thats being
worked up In fact I can arrange for you to be present when the game is
pulled off and you can make the arrests

Who are the people he asked brusquely

Maggie knew it would be fatal to mention Barney or Old Jimmie if that
story about Barlows protection contained any truth Again inspiration
or incredibly swift thinking came to her aid and with sure touch she
twanged one of Barlows rawest and most responsive nerves

Larry Brainard is behind it all Hes been doing a lot of things on the
quiet these last few months Here is where you can get his whole crowd

Larry Brainard

Maggie did not yet know what had befallen Larry and Gavegan had
neglected to telephone his Chief of the arrest Even had Gavegan done
so the large and vague manner in which Maggie had stated the situation
would have stirred Barlows curiosity

All right Ill put a couple of my good men on the case Where shall I
send em

A couple of your good men wont do I want only one of your good
menand that man is yourself

Me growled Barlow What kind of floorwalker dyou think I am Im
too busy

Too busy to take personal charge and get personal credit for one of
the biggest cases that ever went through this office

Maggie had sought only to excite his vanity But unknowingly she had
also appealed to something else in him his very deep concern in the
hostile activities of the District Attorneys office If this girl told
the truth then here might be his chance to display such devotion
to duty as to turn up some such sensational case as would make this
investigation from the District Attorneys office seem to the public
an unholy persecution and make the chagrined District Attorney who
was very sensitive to public opinion think it wiser to drop the whole
matter

How do I know youre not trying to string meor get me out of the way
of something biggeror hand me the doublecross

I shall be there all the time and if you dont like the way the thing
develops you can arrest me I suppose youve got some kind of law with
a stiff punishment attached about conspiracy against an officer

Wellgive me all the dope and tell me where Im to come he yielded
ungraciously

Ive told you all I am going to tell All the important dope youll
get firsthand by being present when the thing happens The place to
come is the Hotel Granthamroom elevenfortytwoat eightthirty
sharp

To this Barlow grudgingly agreed He might have exulted inwardly but
he would have shown no outer graciousness if a committee of citizens had
handed him a reward of a million dollars and an engrossed testimonial to
his unprecedented services Barlow did not know how to thank any one

Five minutes after she left Headquarters Maggie was in the back room of
the Duchesss pawnshop which her rapid planning had fixed upon as the
next station at which she should stop She did not waste a moment in
coming to the point with the Duchess

Red Hannigan is really the most important of Larrys old friends who
are out to get him isnt he she asked

Yesin a way I mean among those who honestly think Larry has turned
stool and squealer He trusted Larry more than any one elseand now
he hates Larry more than any one else Rather natural since he was two
months in the Tombs before he could get bailbecause he thinks Larry
squealed on him

Hows he stand with his crowd

No one higher Theyd all take his word for anything

Can you find him at once Maggie pursued breathlessly

That was a trifling question to ask the Duchess since all the news of
her shadowy world came to her ears in some swift obscure manner

Yes If it is necessary

Its terribly necessary If I cant get him the whole thing may fail

What thing demanded the Duchess

It might all sound impossibly foolish cried the excited desperate
Maggie You might tell me soand discourage meand I simply must go
ahead I feel rather likelike a juggler whos trying for the first
time to keep a lot of new things going in the air all at once But I
think theres a chance that I may succeed Ill tell you just one thing
It all has to do with Larry I think I may help Larry

Ill get Red Hannigan the Duchess said briefly What do you want
with him

Have him come to the Hotel Granthamroom elevenfortytwoat
eightfifteen sharp

Hell be there said the Duchess

There followed a swirling taxiride back to the Grantham and a rapid
change into her most fetching evening gown she had not even a thought
of dinner to play her bold part in the drama which she was excitedly
writing in her mind and for which she had just engaged her cast She was
on fire with terrible suspense would the other actors play their parts
as she intended they shouldwould her complicated drama have the
ending she was hoping for

Had she been in a more composed matteroffact state of mind this play
which she was staging would have seemed the crudest most impossible
melodramaa thing both too absurd and too dangerous for her to risk
But Maggie was just then living through one of the highest periods of
her life she cared little what happened to her And it is just such
moods that transform and elevate what otherwise would be absurd to the
nobly serious that changes the impossible into the possible just as an
exalted mood or mind is or was the primary difference between Hamlet
or Macbeth or Lear and any of the forgotten Bowery melodramas of a
generation now gone

She had been dressed for perhaps ten nervous minutes when the bell rang
She admitted a slight erect welldressed middleaged man with a lean
thinlipped face and a cold hard conservative eye a man of the type
that you see by the dozens in the better hotels of New York and seeing
them you think if you think of them at all that here is the canny
president of some fairsized bank who will not let a client borrow a
dollar beyond his established credit or that here is the shrewd but
unobtrusive power behind some great industry of the Middle West

Im Hannigan he announced briefly I know youre Old Jimmie
Carlisles girl The Duchess told me you wanted me on something big
Whats the idea

You want to get Larry Brainard dont youor whoever it was that
squealed on you

There was a momentary gleam in the hard gray eyes I do

Thats why youre here In a little over an hour if you stay quiet in
the background youll have what you want

Youve got a swelllooking layout here Whats going to be pulled
off

Its not what I might tell you thats going to help you Its what you
hear and see

All right said the thinlipped man Ill pass the questions since
the Duchess told me to do as you said Shes square even if she does
have a grandson whos a stool I suppose Im to be out of sight during
whatever happens

Yes

In the room there were two spacious closets as is not infrequent in the
better class of modern hotels and it had been these two closets which
had been the practical startingpoint of Maggies development of Dick
Sherwoods proposition To one of these she led Hannigan

Youll be out of sight here and youll get every word

He stepped inside and she closed the door Also she took the precaution
of locking it She wished Hannigan to hear but she wished no such
contretemps as Hannigan bursting forth and spoiling her play when it had
reached only the middle of its necessary action

Barlow came promptly at halfpast eight He brought news which for a few
moments almost completely upset Maggies delicately balanced structure

I know who you are now he said brusquely And part of your games
cold before you start

WhyWhat part

Just after you left Headquarters Officer Gavegan showed up He had this
Larry Brainard in towhad pinched him out on Long Island

This announcement staggered Maggie for the moment made all her
strenuous planning seem to have lost its purpose In her normal
condition she might either have given up or betrayed her real intent
But just now in her superexcited state in which she felt she was
fighting desperately for others she was acting far above her ordinary
capacity and she was making decisions so swift that they hardly seemed
to proceed from conscious thought So Barlow vigilant watcher of faces
that he was saw nothing unusual in her expression or manner

What did you do with him she asked

Left him with Gaveganand with Casey who had just come in Trailing
with Brainard was a swell named Hunt cussing mad He was snorting
around about being pals with most of the magistrates and swore hed
have Brainard out on bail inside an hour But what he does dont make
any difference to me Your proposition seems to me dead cold since Ive
already got Brainard and got him right I wouldnt have bothered to
have come here at all except for something you let drop about the pals
he might have been working with these last few months

Thats exactly it she caught him up I never thought that youd
catch Larry Brainard here How could I when if you know me as you say
you also know that he and I are in different campsare fighting each
other Whats going to happen here is something that will show you the
people Larry Brainards been mixed up withthat will turn up for you
the people you want

But whats going to happen Barlow demanded

To this Maggie answered in much the same strain she had used with
Hannigan a few minutes earlier I told you down at Headquarters that
everything thats important youll learn by being present when the thing
actually happened What I tell you doesnt count for muchit might not
be true Its what you see and hear for yourself when things begin to
happen Youre to wait in here She led him to the second large closet
and opened the door

See here he demanded are you framing something on me

How can I in a big hotel like this And even if I were to try youd
certainly make me pay for it later Besides youve got a gun Please
go in quick Im expecting the people here any minute And dont make a
sound that might arouse their suspicions and queer everything

He entered and she closed the door So carefully that he did not hear
it she locked the door no more than in Hannigans case did she want
Barlow to come bungling into a scene before it had reached its climax

All was now ready for the curtain to rise Quivering all through she
waited for Barney Palmer whose entrance was to open her drama She
glanced at her wristwatch which she had left upon the little lacquered
writingtable Ten minutes of nine Ten more minutes to wait She felt
far more of sickening suspense than ever did any young playwright on
the opening night of his first play For she was more than merely
playwright In her desperate overwrought determination Maggie had
assumed for herself the supermortal role of dea ex machina And in
those moments of tense waiting Maggie who so feverishly loathed all she
had been was not at all sure whether she was going to succeed in her
part of goddess from the machine

At five minutes to nine there was a ring She gave a little jump at the
sound That was Barney Though generally when Barney came he used the
latchkey which his assumed dear cousinship and the argued possibility
of their being out and thus causing him to wait around in discomfort
Miss Griersons sense of propriety had unbent far enough to permit him
to possess The truth was of course that Barney had desired the key
so that he might have most private conferences with Maggie at any time
necessity demanded without the stolidly conscientious Miss Grierson
ever knowing what had happened and being therefore unable to give
dangerous testimony

Maggie crossed and opened the door But instead of Barney Palmer it was
Larry who stepped in He quickly closed the door behind him

Larry she cried startled Whywhy I thought the police had you

They did But Hunt was with me and he got hold of a magistrate who
would have made Hunt a present of the Tombs and Police Headquarters if
he had owned them

Then youre out on bail

Got out about ten minutes ago Hunt didnt have any property he could
put up as security so he phoned my grandmother She walked in with an
armload of deeds Why she must own as much property in New York as the
Astor Estate

Larry Im so glad And then remembering what according to her plan
was due to begin to happen almost any moment she exclaimed in dismay
But Larry oh why did you come here now

I wanted to knowyou understandwhat you had decided to do after
learning about your father And I wanted to tell you that after all my
great boasts to you I seem to have failed in every boast Item one the
police have got me Item two since the police have got me my old pals
will also most likely get me Item three when I was arrested at Cedar
Crest Miss Sherwood learned that I had known you all along and believes
I was part of a conspiracy to clean out the family so she chucked
meand Ive lost what I believed my big chance to make good So you
see Maggie it looks as if you were right when you predicted that I was
going to fail in everything I said I was going to do

LarryMiss Sherwood believes that she breathed And then she
remembered again and caught his arm with sudden energy Larry you
mustnt stay here

Why not

Her answer was almost identical with one she had given the previous
evening Because Barney Palmer may be here the next minute

His response was in sense also identical Then Ill stay right here
Theres no one I want to see as much as Barney Palmer And this time
Ill have it out with him

Maggie was in consternation at this unexpected twist which was not in
the brainmanuscript of her play at allwhich indeed threatened to
take her play right out of her hands Please go Larry she cried
desperately And please give me a chance Youll spoil it all if you
stay

Im going to stay right here was his grim response

She realized there was no changing him She glimpsed a closet door
behind him and caught at the chance of saving at least a fragment of
her drama

Stay then but Larry please give me a chance to do what I want to
do Please By this time she had dragged him across the room and
had started to unlock the closet Just wait in hereand keep quiet
Please

He took the key from her fumbling hands unlocked the door and slipped
the key into his pocket All rightIll give you your chance he
promised

He stepped through the door and closed it upon himself entombing
himself in blackness The next moment the glare of a pocket flash was in
his face blinding him

Larry Brainard gritted a low voice in the darkness

Larry could see nothing but there was no mistaking that voice Red
Hannigan he exclaimed

Yesyou damned squealer And Im going to finish you off right here

The light clicked out and a pair of lean hands almost closed on Larrys
windpipe But Larry caught the wrists of the older man in a grip the
other could not break There was a brief struggle in the blackness of
the closet then the slighter man stood still with his wrists manacled
by Larrys hands

Evidently you havent a gun on you Red or you wouldnt have tried
this Larry commented Anyhow you couldnt have got away with killing
in a big hotel whether you had strangled me or shot me I dont blame
you for being sore at me Redonly youve got me all wrong But you
and I are evidently here for the same purpose to get next to something
thats going to happen out in the room What do you say Redlets
suspend hostilities for the present Youve got me where you can follow
me and you can get me any time

You bet Ill get you declared Hannigan And then after a few more
words an armistice was agreed upon between the two men in the closet
and silently tensely they stood in the dark awaiting whatever was to
happen

Outside Maggie that amateur playwright who had tried so desperately to
prearrange events that inexperienced goddess from the machine stood in
a panic of fear and suspense the like of which she had never known




CHAPTER XXXIV


But when Barneys latchkey slid into the door and Barney in a smart
dinner jacket came in Maggie was herself again Indeed she was better
than herself for there rushed to her support that added power which she
had just been despairing of which carries some people through an hour
of crisis and which may occasionally lift an actor above himself when
fortune gives him a difficult yet splendid part which is the great
chance of his career

And Maggie showed to the eye that she was better than her best for
Barney exclaimed the instant he was beside her Gee Maggie you look
like the Queen of Sheba whoever that dame was Any guy would fall for
you tonightand fall so hard that hed break or go broke

But Barney was too eager to await any response Whats behind the
hurryup call you sent in Anything broken yet

Something big But sit down Theres a lot to tell And I must tell it
quickbefore myshe could not force herself to say fatherbefore
Old Jimmie comes and Dick

Then Dicks coming

Yes Things have taken a twist so that everything breaks tonight But
sit down and Ill tell you everything

She had noted that the door behind which Larry stood and to which
he had captured the key was open a bare halfinch It looked no more
suspicious than any closet door that by accident had swung free of its
latch but by deft maneuvering Maggie managed so that Barney sat at the
table with his back toward both closets

Go to it Maggie he urged

The plan which had swiftly developed from Dick Sherwoods idea required
that she should tell much that was the truth and much that was not
truth and required that she should play with every faculty and every
attraction she possessed upon Barneys tremendous vanity and upon his
jealous admiration of her She had to make him believe more in her as a
pal than ever before she had to make him want her more as a woman than
ever before And at this moment she felt herself thrillingly equal to
this vampire role her overstimulated sense of justice had commanded her
to undertake

Things have gone great she began speaking concisely yet trying not
in this eager brevity to lose the convincing effect that she would
be the complete mistress of any enterprise to which she yielded her
interest Dick Sherwood proposed to me again and this time I said
yes I saw that he was ready for anything so I took some things into
my hands I had to for I saw we had to act quick even at the risk of
losing a bit of the maximum figure we had counted on You see I realized
the danger to us in Larry Brainard suddenly showing up and his knowing
as he told us he did who the sucker is that weve been stringing along
Anything might happen any minute from Larry Brainard that would upset
everything So I reasoned that we had to collect quick or run the risk
of never getting a nickel

Some bean youve got Maggie he said admiringly Keep your foot on
the gas pedal

What I did was only the carryingout of the plan you had decided
onof course carrying it out quicker and with a few little changes
that the urgent situation demanded After he proposed I broke down as
per schedule and confessed that I had deceived him to the extent that I
was already married Married to a man I didnt love and who didnt love
me but who was a tightwad and who wouldnt let me go unless he saw a
lot of money in it for him And I gave Dick all the rest of the story
just as we had doped it out

Great work Maggie How did he take it

Exactly as we figured he would He was sorry for me it didnt make any
difference at all in his feelings for me Hed buy my husband offgive
him any price he wantedand just so I wouldnt have to feel myself
bound to such a man a minute longer than necessary hed make a bargain
with him at once and pay him part of the money right down Tonight if
he could get in touch with my husband And so Barney since we had to
act quick and there was no time to bring in another man that I could
pass off as my husband I confessed to him that I was married to you

To me exclaimed Barney

And hes coming here in less than an hour with real money in his
pockets to see if he cant fix a deal with you

Me exclaimed the startled Barney again His beady eyes glowed at her
ardently Gee you know I wish I really was married to you Maggie If
I was you bet money couldnt ever pry you loose from me

Well theres the whole layout Barney Its up to you to be my
grasping bargaining unloving husband for about an hour

I hadnt thought of myself in that part he objected Id figured
that wed bring in a new man to be the husband Its pretty dangerous
for me my stringing Dick along all this while and then suddenly to
enter the act as your husbandand to take the money

Dangerous There was sudden contempt in her voice and in her eyes
So youre that kind of man Barneyafraid And afraid after my
telling Dick you were my husband and his swallowing the thing without
a suspicion Well right this minute is when we call this deal offand
every other deal

Oh dont be so quick with that temper of yours Maggie I merely said
it was dangerous Of course Ill do it

And then Barney asked with a cunning he tried to hide But why did
you ask me to have Old Jimmie show up here right after me We dont need
him

Just whats behind your saying that Barney she demanded sharply

He squirmed a little then spoke the truth You dont love your father
any too much and he doesnt love you any too muchI know that He
neednt really know how much we take off Sherwood if he wasnt here
hed have to take our word for what we got and wed tell him we got
mighty little Then the real money would be divided fiftyfifty between
just you and me

I may not love my father but hes in this on the same basis as you
are or Im out of it she declared I thought you might suggest
something like this thats one reason I asked you to have him come
Another reasonand this is something I forgot to tell you awhile
agowhen I broke down and confessed everything to Dick Sherwood I told
Dick that Old Jimmie was really my guardian and we both agreed that
he should be present as a witness to any agreement and to protect my
interests Still another reason is that since we had to work so fast
the thing to do was to split the money on the spot in three ways and
then each of us shoot off in a different direction tonight before any
bad luck had a chance to break In fact Barney this present minute is
when you and I say our goodbyes

He forgot his scheme to defraud Old Jimmie in the far greater concern
aroused by her last words He leaned across the table and tried to take
her hand an attempt she deftly thwarted

But listen Maggie he asked with husky eagerness you and I are
going to have an understanding to join up with each other soon arent
we You know what I meanbelong to each other You know how I feel
about you

This was the principal point Maggie had been maneuvering toward Before
her was the most difficult scene of the many which she had planned on
her successful management of which the success of everything seemed to
depend Within she was palpitant with the strain and suspense of it
all but on Barney she held cool appraising eyes In this splendid
composure her momentary withdrawal from him she seemed to Barney more
beautiful more desirable more indispensable than at any time since he
had discovered back at the Duchesss that Maggie was a find

Of course I know exactly what you mean Barney she responded with
deliberation bewitchingly alluring in her air of superiority Ive
known for a long time you and I would have to have a real talk Are you
ready for a straight talk now

As straight as you can talk it

Ill probably fall for some man and marry him Every woman does But if
I marry him itll be because I love him But my marrying a man doesnt
mean Im going to go into business with him Im not going to mix love
with businessnot unless the man is the right sort of man Of course it
would be better if the man I marry and the man I take on as a business
partner were the same manbut Im not going to take any risks You
understand me so far

Surest thing you know And every word youve said proves that your head
isnt just something to look pretty with Let me slip this over to you
right at the startIm the right sort of man

Thats exactly what I want to find out she continued with her
deliberation with the air of sitting secure upon the highest level
I know now what I can do Ive proved it Now Im going right ahead
putting over big things You once told me I had it in me to be the best
everand I now know I can be I know Ive got to tie up with a man
and the man has got to be just as good in his way as I am in mine
Right theres where Im in doubt about you I said I was going to talk
straightand Im handing it to you straight I dont know how good you
are

You mean you think Im not big enough to work with you

I mean exactly what I said I said that I didnt really know how good
you are and that I wasnt going to tie up with any man except the
best in the business Youve hinted now and then at a lot of big things
youve put across and how strong you were in certain quarters where it
paid to be strongbut I really know mighty little about you Barney
This present job hasnt required you to do anything special and all
the really hard work Ive done myself Of course I know you are a good
dancer and clever with the ladies and know how to pick up a sucker
and string him along But thats everything I do know And there are
hundreds of men who are good at these things The man I tie up with
has got to be good at a lot of other thingsand Ive got to know hes
good

Good at what other things Maggie he asked with suppressed eagerness

Hes got to be good at putting over all kinds of situations I dont
care how he does it So clever at putting things over that no one ever
guesses hes the man who did it And hes got to be able to give me
protection You know what I mean A woman in the game Im going in for
is absolutely through as far as doing anything big is concerned the
minute she gets a police record Ive got to have a man whos able
to stand between me and the police And Ive got to know from past
performances that the man can do these things Just large words about
what he can do or hints about what he has done dont count for a
nickel with me This is plain hard business Im talking Barney and I
dont mean to hurt your feelings when I tell you that you dont measure
up in any way to the man I need

It had been difficult for Barney to hold himself until she had finished
To start with he had the vain mans constant itch to tell of his
exploits his dislike for the anonymity of his cleverness unjustly
ascribed to some other man And then Maggie had played upon him even
more skillfully than she imagined

Im exactly the man you need in every way he exploded

Those are just words she said evenly I said I had to have something
more than mere words

Im acehigh with Chief Barlow

Youve got to be more explicit

Barney was now all excitement Dont you get what that means Ive
never been locked up once and yet Ive been pulling stuff all the time
And yet look how Larry Brainard that the bunch thought was so clever
got hooked and was sent away I guess you know the answer

Again Barney Ive got to ask you to be more explicit

Then the answer is that all the while Ive been working on an
understanding with Barlow I guess thats explicit

You mean she said in her cool voice that youve been a stoolpigeon
for Barlow

Surethough I dont like the word Thats the only safe way of
staying steady in the gamean understanding with the police All there
is to it is now and then to tip the police off about some dub of a
crook of course youve got to be smooth enough not to let anyone guess
your game

That doesnt seem to me such a strong talking point in your favor she
said thoughtfully

But dont you get the idea Im so strong with Barlow that I can get
away with anything I want to That means I can give you the protection
from the police you just spoke about See

Yes I see Again she spoke thoughtfully But I told you I had to
be shown You must have done some pretty big things to have got such a
standing with Barlow For example

I could write you a book He laughed in his excited pride You ask
for an example I could hardly hold myself in awhile ago when you said
youd practically swung the present deal alone and that Id done almost
nothing Why Maggie I did just one smooth little thing without which
there couldnt have been any deal

What

Youll admit that nothing would have been safe with Larry Brainard
determined to butt in on what you did

Yes

Well Im the little guy that fixed Larry Brainard so he wouldnt hurt
anyone

You did that For the first time Maggie showed what seemed to be a
live interest How

How Youll say it was clever when you learn how And youll say that
Im the man you want on that count of being able to put over a situation
so that no one will ever guess Im the man who did it Youll admit that
putting Larry Brainard out of business so hed stay out was certainly
a stiff jobfor though I dont like him I admit that Larry is one wise
bird One thing I did was to suggest to Barlow that he force Larry to
become a police stool I knew Larry would refuse and I figured out
everything else exactly as it has happened I ask you wasnt that
putting something clever over

It certainly was clever admired Maggie

Wait Thats only half To finish Larry off so that he wouldnt have a
chance I had to finish him off not only with the cops but also with
his pals So I tipped off Barlow to the game Red Hannigan and Jack
Rosenfeldt were pulling and

Then Larry Brainard really didnt do that

No I did it Listentheres some more to it I spread the word so
that it seemed to be a leak from the Police Department that it was
Larry who had squealed on Red Hannigan and Jack Rosenfeldt Did his old
pals start out to get Larry Well now did they If I do say it myself
that was smooth work

It was wonderful agreed Maggie

And theres still more Maggie You remember that charge of stickup
and attempted murder of a Chicago guy that the police are trying to land
Larry on I put that over Im the party that was messed up in that I
was trying to put over a neat little job all on my own but something
went wrong just as I thought I was cleaning out the sucker and I had to
be rough with that Chicago guy in order to make a getaway from him I
beat it straight to Barlow and said that right here was the chance to
fasten something on Larry Barlow took my tip My foot may have slipped
on the original job but my bean certainly did act quick and youve got
to admit I turned an apparent failure into something bigger than success
would have been And thats certainly traveling

It certainly is

And now Maggie Barney pressed her eagerlyIve shown you Im just
the sort you said a man had to be for you to tie up with him Ive shown
you I can guarantee you police protection And Ive shown you Im able
to put over clever situations without any one ever guessing Im the
party who put em over I fit all your specifications How about our
settling right now to join up some placeTorontos the best betsay
three days after we make our getaway after tonights cleanup Lets
be quick about this Maggiebefore Old Jimmie comes in Hes due any
minute now

Isnt that him at the door now breathed Maggie

Both waited intently for a moment But though she pretended so Maggies
interest was not upon the outer door Her attention was fixed as it had
been with sickening fear this last minute upon that halfinch crack
in the closet door behind Barney Why had she in her dismayed urgence
allowed Larry to possess himself of that closet keywhen her plan had
been to keep Hannigan as well as Barlow forcibly behind the scenes
until she had acted out her play She now hoped almost against hope that
Hannigan would not burst forth and ruin what was yet to come Since that
door unluckily had to be unlocked her one chance was given her by the
presence of Larry Perhaps Larry could perceive the larger things she
was striving for and in some way restrain Hannigan

These thoughts were but an instant in passing through her brain
Barneys eyes came back from the outer door to her face Thats not Old
Jimmie yet

No her lips said But her brain was saying since the crack still
remained a halfinch crack Larry understandshes holding back Red
Hannigan

Barney returned swiftly to his charge How about Toronto Maggiesay
exactly seventytwo hours from nowthe Royal Brunswick Hotel

Maggie realized she could no longer put him off if she were to keep
him unsuspicious for the next hour Besides in her desperate
disillusionment concerning herself she did not care what happened to
her or what people might think of her if only she could keep this play
going till its final moment

Yes she saidif we each feel the same way toward each other when
this evenings ended

Maggie he cried Maggie This time when he exultantly caught at
her hand she dared not refuse it to him And she felt an additional
loathing for Barneys caress because she knew that Larry was a witness
to it

Indeed it was difficult for Larry at the sight of Maggies hand in
Barneys too eager palms to hold himself in check and to do this in
addition to holding in check the slight quivering Red Hannigan whose
collar and whose right wrist he had been gripping these last three
minutes For Larry as Maggie had hoped had dimly apprehended something
of Maggies plan and he felt himself bound by the promise she had
extracted from him to let her go through with whatever she had under
way though he had no conception of her plans extent and could of
course not know of the intention of her overwrought mind to give her
plan its final touch in what amounted to her own selfdestruction and
in her vanishing utterly out of the knowledge of all who knew her

Another minute passed then Larry heard three peculiar rings of the bell
of the outer dooran obvious signal Maggie answered the summons
and Larry saw Old Jimmie enter There followed a rapid and compact
conference between the three the substance of which was the telling of
Old Jimmie of the developments against Dick Sherwood which Maggie had
a little earlier recited to Barney together with instructions to Old
Jimmie concerning his new role as Maggies guardian It seemed to Larry
that he caught signs of uneasiness in Jimmie but to all the older man
nodded his head

Presently there was a loud ring Thats Dick exclaimed Barney in a
whisper And mighty eager tooshows that by being ahead of the time
you set Let him in Maggie

Maggie was startled by the ring though she did not show it She thought
rapidly She had definitely asked Dick to telephone before coming Why
hadnt he telephoned Perhaps something had happened to prevent it or
perhaps an idea had come to him by which their plan could be bettered
without a telephone message In either case she and Dick might have
to improvise and deftly catch cues tossed to each other as experienced
actors sometimes do without the audience ever knowing that a hiatus in
the play has been skillfully covered

Maggie stood up You both understand what youre to do

Both whispered yes Larry watched Maggie start across the room his
whole figure quivering with suspense as to what was going to happen when
Dick entered He was quite sure there was more here than appeared upon
the surface quite sure that Maggie did not intend that the business
with Dick should work out as she had outlined What could Maggie
possibly be up to he asked himself in feverish wonderment and could
find no answer For of course Larry had no knowledge of that most
important fact that Maggie had actually made a confession to Dicknot
the fraudulent confession she had told Barney ofbut an honest and
complete confession and that in consequence she and Dick were working
in cooperation

From his crack Larry could not quite see the outer door But after she
opened the door he saw Maggie fall back with an inarticulate cry her
face suddenly blanched with astounded fright And then Larry experienced
one of the greatest surprises of his lifea surprise so unnerving that
he almost loosed his hold upon Red Hannigan For instead of Dick there
walked into the room the tall whitehaired figure of Joe Ellison and
Joes lean prisonblanched face was aquiver with a devastating purpose
How in the name of God had Joe come to be hereand what did that
terrible look portend

But Larrys surprise was but an unperturbing emotion compared to the
effect of her fathers appearance with his terrible face upon Maggie
Life seemed suddenly to go out of her She realized that the clever play
which she had constructed so rapidly and upon which she had counted to
clear the tangle for which she was in part responsible and to bring
her back in time as the seeming fulfillment of the dream of a happy and
undisillusioned fathershe realized that her poor brilliant play
had come to an instant end before it was fairly started and that the
control of events had passed into other hands




CHAPTER XXXV


At the entrance of Joe Ellison instead of the expected Dick Barney and
Old Jimmie had sprung up from the table in amazement Joe strode past
Maggie hardly heeding his daughter and faced the two men

I guess you know me Jimmie Carlisle said Joe with a terrifying
restraint of tone The pal I trustedthe pal I turned everything over
tothe pal who doublecrossed me in every way

Joe Ellison gasped Jimmie suddenly as ghastly as a dead man II
didnt know you were out

Im out all right But Ill probably go in again for what Im going to
do to you And you thereturning on Barneyyoure got up enough like
a professional dancer to be the Barney Palmer Ive heard of

What business is it of yours who I am Barney tried to bluster
Perhaps you wont mind introducing yourself

Im the man whos going to settle with you and Old Jimmie Carlisle Is
that introduction enough If not then Im Joe Ellison the father of
this girl here you call Maggie Carlisle and Maggie Cameron that you two
have made into a crook

Your daughter exclaimed Barney in stupefaction Why shes Jimmie
Carlisles

Hes always passed her off as such that much Ive learned Speak
up Jimmie Carlisle Whose daughter is this girl youve turned into a
crook

Your daughter Joe stammered Old Jimmie But about my making her
into a crookyoureyoure all wrong there

So shes not a crook and you didnt make her one demanded Joe with
the calm of unexploded dynamite whose fuse is sputtering I left you
about twelve or fifteen hundred a year to bring her up onas a decent
respectable girl Thats twentyfive or thirty a week If shes not a
crook how can she on twentyfive a week have all the swell clothes
Ive seen her in and be living in a suite like this that costs from
twentyfive to fifty a day And if she isnt a crook why is she mixed
up with two such crooks as you And if she isnt a crook why is she in
a game to trim young Dick Sherwood

The two men started and wilted at these driving questions Butbut
Joe stammered Old Jimmie youve gone out of your head Shes not in
any such game She never even heard of any Dick Sherwood

Cut out your lies Jimmie Carlisle Joe ordered harshly Weve got
something more to do here the four of us than to waste any time on
lies And just to prove to you that your lies will be wasted Ill lay
all my cards face up on the table Since I got out Ive been working for
the Sherwoods Larry Brainard was working there before me and got me
my job Ive seen this girl heremy daughter that youve made into a
crookout there twice Dick Sherwood was supposed to be in love with
her At the end of this afternoon some officers came to the Sherwoods
and arrested Larry Brainard I was working outside overheard what
was happening and crept up on the porch Officer Gavegan who was in
charge found a painting among Larry Brainards things Miss Sherwood
said that it was a picture of Miss Maggie Cameron who had been visiting
there and I could see that it was Officer Gavegan said it was a
picture of Maggie Carlisle daughter of Jimmie Carlisle and that she
was a crook Larry Brainard cornered had to admit that Gavegan was
right I guessed at once who Maggie Carlisle was since she was just the
age my girl would have been and since you never had any children
And thats how Jimmie Carlisle standing there outside the window
concluded the terrible voice of Joe Ellison I learned for the first
time that the baby Id trusted with you to be brought up straight and
that I believed was now happy somewhere as a nice decent girl you had
really brought up as your own daughter and trained to be a crook


Old Jimmie shrank back from Joes blazing eyes his mouth opened
spasmodically but no words came therefrom There was stupendous silence
in the room Within the closet Larry now understood that low strange
sound he had heard on the Sherwoods porch and which Gavegan and Hunt
had investigated It had been the suppressed cry of Joe Ellison when
he had learned the truththe difference between his dreams and the
reality He could not imagine what that moment had been to Joe the
swift unbelievable knowledge that had seemed to be tearing his very
being apart

Larry had an impulse to step out to Joes side But just as a little
earlier he had felt the scene had belonged to Maggie he now felt that
this situation the greatest in Joes life belonged definitely to Joe
was almost sacredly Joes own property Also he felt that he was about
to learn many things which had puzzled him Therefore he held himself
back at the same time keeping his hold upon Red Hannigan

During this moment of silence while Larry was wondering what was going
to happen his eyes also took in the figure of Maggie all her powers
of action and expression still paralyzed by appalling consternation He
understood at least to a degree what she was going through He knew
this much of her plan that she had intended to cut loose in some way
from Barney and Old Jimmie and that she had intended that her father
should continue to cherish the dream that had been his happiness for so
long And now her father had come upon her in the company of Barney and
Old Jimmie and in a situation whose every superficial circumstance was
such as to make him believe the worst of her

Joe turned on the smartly dressed Barney Ill take you first you
imitation swell because Im saving Jimmie Carlisle to the last went
on Joes crunching voice Im going to twist your damned neck for what
youve helped do to my girl but if you want to say anything first say
it

Barneys response was a swift movement of his right hand toward his
left armpit But Barney Palmer like almost all his kind was a very
indifferent gunman and he had no knowledge of the reputation for
masterful quickness that had been Joe Ellisons twenty years earlier
Before his compact automatic was fairly out of its holster beneath his
armpit it was in Joe Ellisons hands

I sized you up for that kind of rat and was watching you continued
Joe in his same awful grimness Im not going to shoot you unless you
make me Im going to twist that pretty neck of yours But first out
with anything youve got to say for yourself

I havent had anything to do with this business said Barney trying
to affect a bold manner

You lie I know that in this game against Dick Sherwood in which you
used my girl you were the real leader

Welleven if I did use your girl I only used her the way I found
her

You lie again I know how your kind work cleverly putting crooked
ideas into girls minds and exciting their imagination so theyll work
with you Your case is closed He turned to his onetime friend What
have you got to say for yourself Jimmie Carlisle

Old Jimmie believed that his last hour was come He showed something
of the defiant almost maniacal courage of a coward who realizes he can
retreat no farther

What I got to say Joe Ellison he snarled in a sudden rage which
bared his yellow teeth is that Im even with you at last

Even with me What for

For the way you doublecrossed me in nineteenone in that Gordon
business You never gave me a dimesaid the thing had fallen downyet
I know there was a big haul

I told you the truth That Gordon thing was a fizzle

Theres where youre lying It was a cleanup And I knew youd been
cheating me out of my share in other deals

Youre absolutely wrong Jimmie Carlisle But if you thought that why
didnt you have it out with me at the time

Because I knew you would lie You were a better talker than I was and
since our outfit always sided with you I knew I wouldnt have a chance
then But I reasoned that if I kept quiet and kept on being your friend
Id get my chance to get even if I waited awhile I waitedand I
certainly got my chance

Go on Jimmie Carlisle

And Old Jimmie went ona startlingly different Old Jimmie his pentup
evil now loosed into quivering malignant triumph went on with the
feverish exultation of a twisted perverted mind that has brooded
long over an imagined injustice that has brooded greedily and long in
private over his revenge and at last has his chance to gloat in the
open

When you were sent away Joe Ellison and turned over your daughter to
me with those orders about seeing that she was brought up as a decent
girl I began to see the big chance Id been waiting for I asked
myself What is the dearest thing in the world to Joe Ellison The
answer was this idea hed got about his girl I asked myself What is
the biggest way I can get even with Joe Ellison The answer was to make
Joe Ellison believe all the time hes in stir that his girl is growing
up the way he wants her to be and yet to bring her up the exact thing he
didnt want her to be And thats exactly what I did

Youdidsuch a thing breathed Joe Ellison almost incredulous

Thats exactly what I did Old Jimmie went on gloatingly It was
easy No one knew you had a daughter so I passed her off as my own baby
by a marriage Id not told any one about I saw that she always lived
among crooks looked at things the way crooks do and grew up with
no other thought than to be a crook I never had an idea of using her
myself till she began to look like such a good performer this last
year and then my idea no matter what Barney Palmer may have planned
was to use her only in a couple of stunts My main idea always was when
you came out with your grand idea of what your girl had grown up to be
for you suddenly to see your girl and know her as your girl and know
her to be a crook That smash to you was the big thing to mewhat Id
planned for and waited for I didnt expect the blowoff to come like
this I didnt expect to be caught in it when it did happen But since
it has happened wellTheres your daughter Joe Ellison Look at her
Look at what Ive made her I guess Im even all right

My God breathed Joe Ellison staring at the lean face twisting with
triumphant malignancy I didnt think there could be such a man

He slowly turned upon Maggie This was the first direct recognition he
had taken of her since his entrance

I dont suppose you can guess what your being what you are has meant
to me he began in a numbed tone which grew accusingly harsh as he
continued But Id think that a daughter of mine with such a mother
would have had more instinctive sense than to have gone into such a game
with such a pair of crooks

Its trueI have been what you think meI did go into this thing
against Dick Sherwood Maggie responded in a voice that at first was
faltering then that stumbled rapidly on in her eagerness to pour out
all the facts Butbut Larry Brainard had kept after meand finally
he made me see how wrong I was headed And then this afternoon before
I spoke to you Larry told me that you were my real father When
I learned the truthhow I had been cheated out of being something
elsehow I was the exact opposite of what you had wanted me to be and
believed me to beI felt about it almost exactly as you feel about it
II made up my mind to clear up at once all the wrong I was responsible
forand then disappear in such a way that youd never have your dream
of me spoiled And soand so this afternoon after I left Cedar Crest
I confessed the whole truth to Dick Sherwoodabout our plan to cheat
him And like the really splendid fellow he is Dick Sherwood offered to
help me set straight the things I wanted to set straight Particularly
to clear Larry Brainard And so my being here as you find me is part
of a plan between Dick Sherwood and myself Its really a frameup A
frameup to catch Barney Palmer and Jimmie Carlisle

A frameup ejaculated these two in startled unison

How a frameup demanded her father no bit of the accusing harshness
gone out of his voice

Our plan against Dick Sherwood was to have him propose to me then for
me to confess that I was really married to a mean sort of man I didnt
lovethe idea being that Dick would be infatuated enough to pay a big
sum to a dummy husband and the three of us would disappear as soon as
we got Dicks money Dick offered to go through with the plan as
Barney Palmer and Jimmie Carlisle had shaped it upgo through with it
tonightand then after money had passed wed have a criminal case
against them By reminding him that Larry Brainard knew just what we
were up to and might spoil everything if we didnt act at once I got
Barney Palmer worked up to the point where he was going to pose as my
husband and take the money Dick Sherwood was to come a little later
after hed first telephoned me with a big roll of marked money

There were stuttered exclamations from Barney and Old Jimmie which
were cut off by the dominant incisiveness of Joe Ellisons words to his
daughter

I think youre lying to me Besides even if youre telling the truth
its a pretty way youve taken to clear things up Dont you see that by
letting Dick Sherwood come here and play such a part youd be dead sure
to involve him and his family in a dirty police story that the papers
of the whole country would play up as a sensation Its plain to any one
that thats no way a person who wanted to square things would use Dick
Sherwood And thats why I think youre lying

I had thought of thatyoure right said Maggie And so I wasnt
going to do it He was going to telephone mejust about this timeand
when he called up I was going to fake his message I was going to tell
Barney Palmer and Old Jimmie that Dick had just telephoned he wasnt
coming because one of the two had just sold him a tip for ten thousand
dollars that this was a crooked game I thought this would have started
a quarrel between the two they are suspicious of each other anyhow
Each would have accused the other and in their quarrel they would have
been likely to have let out a lot of truth that would have completely
given each other away

Not a bad plan at all commented Joe Ellison He tried to peer deep
into his daughter for a moment his inflamed face relaxing neither in
its harshness nor its doubt of her But since you are the clever crook
I actually know you to be from your work on Dick Sherwood and since
Jimmie Carlisle says he has trained you to be a crook I believe that
everything youve told me is just something youve cleverly invented on
the spur of the momentjust so many lies

Butbut

She broke off before the harsh accusing doubt of his pale face For
a fraction of a moment no one spoke Then the telephone bell began to
ring

Dick breathed Maggie and started for the telephone

Stay right where you are her father ordered Ill answer that
telephone myself and see whether youre lying to me about Dick
Sherwood No well do this together Ill hold the receiver and hear
what he says Youll do the talking and youll answer just what I tell
you to and youll keep your hand tight over the mouthpiece while Im
giving you your orders You twoto Barney and Old Jimmie with a
significant movement of Barneys automaticyoud better behave while
this telephone business is going on

The next moment Larry was hearing or rather witnessing the strangest
telephone conversation of his experience Maggie was holding the
transmitter and Joe had the receiver at his ears grimly covering the
two men with the automatic Maggie obediently kept her palm tight over
the mouthpiece during Joes brief whispered directions and no one in
the room except Joe not even Maggie had the slightest idea of what was
really passing over the wires

What Larry heard was no more than a dozen most commonplace words in the
world transformed into the most absorbing words in the language Joe
ordered Maggie to answer with hello in her usual tone which she did
and Joe after a startled expression at the first words that came over
the wire listened with immobile face for four or five seconds Then he
nodded imperatively to Maggie and she put her hand over the mouthpiece

Ask him how much and when he wanted it to be paid he ordered

How much and when does he want it to be paid repeated Maggie

Again Joe listened for several moments and then ordered as before Say
Yes

Yes said Maggie

Another period of waiting and Joe ordered Say Ive got a much
better plan that supersedes the old

Ive got a much better plan that supersedes the old

There was yet another period of waiting then Joe commanded Tell him
he really mustnt and say goodbye quick

You really mustnt Goodbye

The instant her Goodbye was out of her mouth Joe clicked the receiver
upon its hook and stood regarding the breathless Maggie His pale
stern face was not quite so severe as before Presently he spoke I
know now that you really were sick of what youd been trying to dothat
youd really broken away from these twothat youd really confessed to
Dick and are now all square with him

The word Father struggled chokingly toward her lips But she only
said

Im gladyou know

And you were shrewd in that guess you made of what one of these two
would do Joe crossed back to Barney and Old Jimmie You two must
have been almighty afraid because of Larry Brainard that your game was
suddenly collapsing and each must have been trying to grab a piece for
himself before he ran away

What you talking about gruffly demanded Barney

Perhaps Im talking about you But more particularly about Jimmie
Carlisle For just now Dick Sherwood said when he telephoned that an
hour or two ago Jimmie Carlisle had hunted him up had hinted that he
was going to lose a lot of money unless he was properly advised and
offered to give him certain valuable information for five thousand
cash

Barney turned upon his partner You damned thief he snarled tensed
as if about to spring upon the other

Old Jimmie turned greenishly pale shrank away from Barney his every
expression proclaiming his guilt Then Maggie again found her voice

And at about the same time Barney was trying to doublecross Jimmie
Carlisle Barney proposed to me that after wed got Dick Sherwoods
money wed tell Jimmie Carlisle wed got very little and divide the
real money fiftyfifty between just us two

You damned thief snarled Old Jimmie back at his partner

The next moment Barney and Old Jimmie were upon each other striking
wildly clawing But the moment after Joe Ellison his repressed rage
now unloosed and with the superstrength of his supreme fury had torn
the two apart

You dont do that to each otherthat job belongs to me he cried
His right arm flung Barney backward so that Barney went staggering over
himself and sprawled upon the floor Joe gripped Old Jimmies collar
and his right hand painfully twisted Jimmies arm And I finish you off
first Jimmie Carlisle for what youve done to me and my girl But for
Larry Brainard you Jimmie Carlisle would have succeeded in your scheme
to make my girl a crook Id like to give you a thousand years of agony
you damned ratbut thats beyond me His right hand shifted swiftly
from Old Jimmies arm to his throat But Im going to choke your rats
life out of youyour lying sneaking devils life out of you

Old Jimmie squirmed and twisted with those long fingers clamped
mercilessly around his throat his eyes rolling and his mouth gaping
with voiceless cries He was indeed being shaken as a rat might be
shaken

DontDont cried the frantic Maggie and started to seize her
father to pull him away But she was halted by her arm being caught by
Barney

Let Jimmie have it he said fiercely to her and flung her to the
farthest corner of the room And grimly exultant over what seemed to be
Old Jimmies doom he started for the door to make his own escape

Up to the moment of Joe Ellisons eruption Larry had felt bound to
remain a mere spectator where he was long as the time had seemed to
him it had in fact been less than half an hour He had felt bound at
first by his promise to Maggie to let her work out her plan and bound
later by his sense that this situation belonged to Joe Ellison But now
this swift crisis dissolved all such obligations He sprang from his
closet to take his part in the drama that was so swiftly unfolding




CHAPTER XXXVI


Larry caught and whirled around Barney Palmer just as the hand of the
escaping Barney was on the knob of the outer door

No you dont Barney Palmer he cried You stay right here

Startled as Barney was by this appearance of his dearest enemy he
wasted no precious time on mere words He swung a vicious blow at Larry
intended to remove this barrier to his freedom But the experienced
Larry let it glance off his forearm and with the need of an
instantaneous conclusion he sent a terrific right to Barneys chin
Barney staggered back fell in a crumpled heap and lay motionless

Sparing only the fraction of a second to see that Barney was momentarily
out of it Larry sprang upon Joe Ellison and tried to break the deadly
grips Joe held upon Old Jimmie

Stop Joestop he cried peremptorily Your killing Jimmie Carlisle
isnt going to help things

Without relaxing his holds Joe turned upon this interferer

Larry Brainard Howd you come in here

Ive been here all the time But Joedont kill Jimmie Carlisle

You keep outthis is my business Joe fiercely replied If youve
been here all the time then you know what hes done to me and what
hes done to my girl You know he deserves to have his neck twisted
offand Im going to twist it off

Larry perceived that Joes sense of tremendous injury had made him for
the moment a madman in his rage Only the most powerful appeal had a
chance to bring him back to sanity

Listen Joelisten he cried desperately straining to hold back the
others furious strength from its destructive purpose After whats
happened every one is bound to know that Maggie is your daughter
Understand that Joeevery one will know that Maggie is your daughter
Its not going to help you to be charged with murder And think of
this Joewhats it going to do to your daughter to have her father a
murderer

Whats that Joe Ellison asked dazedly

Larry saw that his point had penetrated to the others reason So he
drove on repeating what he had said

Understand this Joeevery one will now know that Maggie is your
daughter You simply cant prevent their knowing that now Remember how
for over fifteen years youve been trying to do the best you could for
her Do you now want to do the worst thing you can do The worst thing
you can do for Maggie is to make her father a murderer

I guess thats right Larry he said huskily Thanks

He pushed the halfstrangled Jimmie Carlisle away from him Youll get
yours in some other way he said grimly

Old Jimmie staggering caught the back of a chair for support He
tenderly felt his throat and blinked at Larry and Joe and Maggie He
did not try to say anything In the meantime Barney had recovered
consciousness had struggled up and was standing near Old Jimmie
Their recognition that they were sharers of defeat had served to restore
something of the sense of alliance between the two

Well anyhow Larry Brainard snarled Barney you havent had
anything to do with putting this across

It was Joe Ellison who replied Larry Brainard has had everything to
do with putting this across Hes been beating you all the time from the
very beginning though you may not have known it And though hes seemed
to be out of things for the last few hours hes been the actual power
behind everything thats happened up to this minute So dont fool
yourselfLarry Brainard has beaten you out at every point

A sense of triumph glowed within Larry at this There had been a time
when he had wanted the animal satisfaction which would have come from
his giving violent physical punishment to these twoparticularly to
Barney But he had no desire now for such empty vengeance

Well I guess youve got nothing on me Barney growled at them so
Ill be moving along Better come too Jimmie

While he spoke a figure had moved from Larrys closet with the silence
of a swift shadow Its thin hand gripped Barneys shoulder

I guess _Ive_ got something on you it said

Barney whirled Red Hannigan he gasped

Yes Red Hanniganyou stoolyou squealer said Red Hannigan I
heard you brag about being Barlows stool and I heard everything else
you bragged about to Joe Ellisons girl Id bump you off right now if
I had my gat with me and if I had any chance at a getaway But Ill
be looking after you and the gang will be looking after you till you
diethe same as you set us after Larry Brainard No matter what else
happens to you youll always have that as something extra waiting for
you And when the time comes well get you

As silently as he had appeared from the closet as silently he let
himself out of the room The glowering features of Barney had faded to
a pasty white while Hannigan had spoken and now the hand which tried to
bring a handkerchief to his lips shook so that he could hardly find his
face For none knew so well as Barney Palmer how inescapable was this
thing which would be hanging over him until the end of his days

Before any one in the room could speak there came a loud pounding from
within the door of the closet Larry and Red Hannigan had not occupied
Oh Id completely forgotten exclaimed Maggieand indeed she had
forgotten all that was not immediately connected with the situation
created by her fathers unexpected entrance She crossed and unlocked
the door and Barlow stepped out

Chief Barlow exclaimed the astonished Larry and all the other men
gazed at the Chief of Detectives with an equal surprise

He is part of my frameup Maggie explained at large I wanted both
the police and Larrys old friends to know the truth at first handand
clear him before I went away

Wasnt that Red Hannigan who just spoke were Barlows first words

Yes said Larry

Barney and Old Jimmie as well had perked up at the appearance of
Barlow as though at aid which had come just in time But Barlow turned
upon Barney a cold police eye

I heard you brag that you were my stool Thats a lie

WhywhyChief Barney stammered He had counted upon help here
where there had existed mutually advantageous relations for so long

I heard you say you had my protection Thats another lie Youve
squealed on a few people but Ive never given you a thing

Barney gasped at this He knew as every one in the room also knew
that Barlow was lying But Barlow held all the cards Rough and ruthless
police politician that he was he made it his business always to hold
the highest cards As sick of soul as a man can be Barney realized that
Barlow was doing exactly what Barlow always didwas swinging to the
side that had the most evidence and that would prove most advantageous
to him And Barney realized that he was suffering the appointed fate
of all stoolpigeons who are found out by their fellow criminals to be
stoolpigeons Such informers are of no further use and according to
the police code they must be given punishment so severe as to dissipate
any unhealthy belief on the publics part that there could ever have
been any alliance between the two

Ive used this young lady who seems to have been Jimmie Carlisles
daughter and now seems to be the daughter of this oldtimer Joe Ellison
for a little private sleuthing on my own hook Barlow went onfor it
was the instinct of the man to claim the conception and leadership
of any idea in whose development he had a part He spoke in a brusque
toneas why should he not since he was addressing an audience he
lumped together as just so many crooks Through this little stunt I
pulled tonight Ive got on to your curves Barney Palmer And yours
too Jimmie Carlisle And Im going to run the pair of you in

This was too much for Barney Palmer Even though he knew that his
position as a stool who was known to be a stool was without hope
whatever he went utterly to pieces

For Gods sake Chief he burst out frantically youre not going to
treat me like that You could get me out of this easy Think of all Ive
done for you For Gods sake Chieffor Gods sake

Shut up ordered Barlow doubling a big fist

Chokingly Barney obeyed Old Jimmie coward though he was and lacking
entirely Barneys quality of a bravo had accepted the situation with
the twitching calm of one to whom the worst has often happened Shut
up repeated Barlow and get it fixed in your beans that Im going to
run you two in

Run them in because of this Sherwood affair asked Larry

Surest thing you know Ive got all the evidence I seed

But Larry was beginning protestingly when the doorbell rang again
Maggie opened the door and there entered Miss Sherwood with Hunt just
behind her and Dick just behind him and Casey and Gavegan following
these three All in the room were surprised at this invasion with the
sole exception of Joe Ellison

When Mr Dick spoke over the phone about your coming he said to Miss
Sherwood I asked you not to do it

Barlow was prompt to speak and the sudden change in his voice would
have been amazing to those who do not know how the little great men
of the Police Department and other little great men can alter their
tones He had recognized Miss Sherwood at once as would any one else at
all acquainted with influential New York

Miss Sherwood I believe he said essaying a slight bow

Yes Though I fear I have not the pleasure of knowing you

Deputy Barlow head of the Detective Bureau of the Police Department
he informed her Entirely at your service

Just what is going on here she queried I know a part of what
has happenedshe was addressing herself particularly to Maggie and
Larryfor Dick telephoned me about seven and I came right into town
He told me everything he knewwhich threw a different light on a lot
of eventsand Dick telephoned at about nine that I was coming over But
something more seems to have happened

Miss Sherwood its like began Barlow

Just a second Chief Larry interrupted Larry knew what a sensational
story this would be as it had developedand he knew in advance just how
it would be seized upon and played up by the newspapers And Larry did
not want unpleasant publicity for his friends three in that room were
trying to make a fresh start in life nor for those who had been his
friends Chief do you want to make an arrest on a charge which will
involve every person in this room in a sensational story Of course I
know most of us here dont weigh anything with you But why drag Miss
Sherwood who is innocent in every way into a criminal story that will
serve to cheapen her and every decent person involved Besides it can
only be a conspiracy charge and theres more than a probability that
you cant prove your case So why make an arrest that will drag in Miss
Sherwood

Barlow had a mind which functioned with amazing rapidity on matters
pertaining to his own interest He realized on the instant how it might
count for him in the future if he were in a position to ask a favor of a
person of Miss Sherwoods standing and he spoke without hesitation

I dont know anything about this Sherwood matter If anyone ever asks
me theyll not get a word

There was swift relief on the faces of Barney and Old Jimmie to be
instantly dispelled by Chief Barlows next statement which followed his
last with only a pause for breath

The main thing we want is to stick these two crooks away He turned on
Barney and Old Jimmie Ive just learned you two fellows are the birds
I want for that Gregory stock business Ive got you for fair on that
Itll hold you a hundred times tighter than any conspiracy charge
Casey Gaveganhustle these two crooks out of here

The next moment Casey and Gavegan had handcuffs on the prisoners and
were leading them out

Good for you Larry Casey whispered warmly as he went by with Barney
I knew you were going to win out though it might be an extrainning
game

At the door Barlow paused I hope Ive done everything all right Miss
Sherwood

Yesas far as I know Mr Barlow

Again Barlow started out and again turned And you Brainard he
said rather grudgingly I guess you neednt worry any about that
charge against you Itll be dropped

And with that Barlow followed his men and his prisoners out of the room

Then for a moment there was silence As Larry saw and felt that moment
it was a moment so large that words would only make a faltering failure
in trying to express it He himself was suddenly free of all clouds
and all dangers He had succeeded in what he had been trying to do with
Maggie A father and a daughter were meeting with each knowing their
relationship for the first time There was so much to be said among
all of them that could only be said as souls relaxed and got acquainted
with each other

It was so strained so stupendous a moment that it would quickly have
become awkward and anticlimacteric but for the tact of Miss Sherwood

Mr Brainard she began in her smiling direct manner with a touch
of brisk commonplace in it which helped relieve the tension I want
to apologize to you for the way I treated you late this afternoon As I
said Ive just had a talk with Dick and hes told me everythingexcept
some things we may all have to tell each other later I was entirely
in the wrong and you were entirely in the right And the way youve
handled things seems to have given Dick just that shock which you said
he needed to awaken him to be the man its in him to be Im sure we all
congratulate you

She gave Larry no chance to respond She knew the danger in such an
emotional crisis as this of any letup So she went right on in her
brisk tone of ingratiating authority

I guess weve all been through too much to talk You are all coming
right home with me Mr Brainard and Mr Ellison live there Im their
boss and theyve got to come And youve got to come Miss Ellison if
you dont want to offend me I wont take no Besides your place is
near your father Wear what you have on in a half a minute you can put
enough in a bag to last until tomorrow Tomorrow well send in for
the rest of your thingswhatever you wantand send a note to your Miss
Grierson paying her off You and your father will have my car she
concluded Mr Brainard and Dick will ride in Dicks car and Mr Hunt
will take me

And as she ordered so was it

For fifteen minutesperhaps half an hourafter it rolled away from
the Grantham Hotel there was absolute stillness in Miss Sherwoods
limousine which she had assigned to Maggie and her father Maggie was
near emotional collapse from what she had been through and now she
was sitting tight in one corner away from the dark shadow in the other
corner that was her newly discovered father who had cared for her so
much that he had sought to erase from her mind all knowledge of his
existence She wanted to say somethingdo something she was torn with
a poignant hunger But she was so filled with pulsing desires and fears
that she was impotent to express any of the million things within her

And so they rode on dark shadows almost half the width of the deeply
cushioned seat between them Thus they had ridden along Jackson Avenue
almost into Flushing when the silence was broken by the first words
of the journey They were husky words yearning and afraid of their own
sound and were spoken by Maggies father

II dont know what to call you Willwill Maggie do

Yes she whispered

ImIm not much the husky voice ventured on but what you said
about going awayfor my sakedo you think you need to do it

Ive madesuch a mess of myself she choked out

Other people were to blame he said And out of it all I think
youre going to be whatwhat I dreamed you were Andand

There was another stifling silence Yes she prompted

I wanted to keep out of your lifefor your sake he went on in his
strained suppressed voice Butbut if youre not ashamed of me
now that you know allin the darkness his groping hand closed upon
hersI wish you wouldntgo away from me Maggie

And then the surging incoherent thing in her that bad been struggling
to say itself this last halfhour suddenly found its voice in a single
word

Father she cried and flung her arms around his neck

Maggie he sobbed crushing her to him

All the way to Cedar Crest they said not another word just clung to
each other in the darkness sobbingthe first miraculous embrace of
a father and daughter who had each found that which they had never
expected to have




CHAPTER XXXVII


It was ten the next morning at Cedar Crest and Larry Brainard sat in
his study mechanically going over his figures and plans for the Sherwood
housing project

For Larry the storms of the past few weeks and the whirlwind of last
night had cleared away There was quiet in the house and through
the open windows he could glimpse the broad lawn almost singing in
its sungladdened greenness and farther on he could glimpse the
Sound gleaming placidly Once for perhaps ten minutes he had seen the
overalled and strawhatted figure of Joe Ellison busy as usual among the
flowers He had strained his eyes for a glimpse of Maggie but he had
looked in vain

Despite all that had come to pass at the Grantham the previous evening
Larry was just now feeling restless and rather forlorn His breakfast
had been brought to him in his room and he had not seen a single member
of last nights party at the Grantham since they had all divided up
according to Miss Sherwoods orders and driven away that is he had
really seen no one except Dick

Dick had gripped his hand when he had slipped in beside Dick in the low
seat of the roadster Youre all right Captain Nemoonly Im going
to be so brash as to call you Larry after this Dick had said If
youll let me you and I are going to be buddies

He was all right Dick was Dick Sherwood was a thoroughbred

And there was another matter which had pleased him The Duchess had
called him up that morning had congratulated him in terms so brief
that they sounded perfunctory but which Larry realized had all his
grandmothers heart in them and had said she wanted him to take over
the care of all her housesthose she had put up as bail for him
When could he come in to see her about this He understood this
dustyseeming stooped inarticulate grandmother of his as he had not
before Considering what her life had been she also was a brick

But notwithstanding all this Larry was lonelyhungrily lonelyand
was very much in doubt Miss Sherwood had spoken to him fair enough the
night beforeyet he really did not know just how he stood with her And
thenMaggie That was what meant most to him just now True Maggie had
emerged safe through perils without and within and to get her through
to some such safety as now was hers had been his chief concern these
many months He wanted to see her to speak to her But he did not know
what her attitude toward him would now be He did not know how to go
about finding her He was not even certain where she had spent the
night He wanted to see her yet was apulse with fear of seeing her She
would not be hostile he knew that much but she might not love him
and at the best a meeting would be awkward with so wide a gap in their
lives to be bridged

He was brooding thus when there was a loud knocking at his door Without
waiting for his invitation to enter the door was flung open and Hunt
strode in leaving the door wide behind him His face was just one great
excited grin He gave Larry a thump upon the back which almost knocked
Larry over and then pulled him back to equilibrium by seizing a hand in
both of his and then almost shook it off

Larry my son exploded the big painter Ive just done it And I did
it just as you ordered me to Forgot that Miss Sherwood and I had had
a falling out and as per your orders I walked straight up to her and
asked her And Larry you sonofagun you were right She said yes

Youre lucky old man exclaimed Larry warmly returning the painters
grip

And Larry thats not all You told me I had the clearness of vision
of a cold boiled lobstersaid I was the greatest fool that ever had
brains enough not to paint with the wrong end of an umbrella Paid me
some little compliment like that

Something like that Larry agreed

Well Larry old son you were right again Ive been a worse fool
than all you said Been blinder than one of those varnished skulls some
toughstomached people use for paperweights After shed said yes
she gave me the inside story of why we had fallen out And guess why it
was

You dont want me to guess You want to tell me So go to it

Larry we men will never know how clever women really are Hunt
shook his head with impressive emphasis Nor how they understand our
naturesthe clever womennor how well they know how to handle us She
confessed that our quarrel was on her part carefully planned from
the beginning with a definite result in view She told me shed always
believed me a great painter if Id only break loose from the pretty
things people wanted and paid me so much for The trouble as she saw
it was to get me to cut loose from so much easy money and devote myself
entirely to real stuff The only way she could see was for her to tell
me I couldnt paint anything worth while and tell it so straightout
as to make me believe that she believed itand thus make me so mad that
Id chuck everything and go off to prove to her that I damned well could
paint I certainly got soreI ducked out of sight swearing Id show
herand oh well you know the rest Tell me now can you think of
anything cleverer than the way she handled me

Its just about what I would expect of Miss Sherwood Larry commented

Excuse me said a voice behind them I found the door open may I
come in

Both men turned quickly Entering was Miss Sherwood

Isabel exclaimed the happy painter I was just telling Larry
hereyou know

Miss Sherwoods tone tried to be severe and she tried not to smileand
she succeeded in being just herself

I came to talk business with Mr Brainard And Im going to stay to
talk business with Mr Brainard But Ill give him five seconds for
congratulationsprovided at the end of the five seconds Mr Hunt gets
out of the room

Larry congratulated the two congratulated them as warmly as he felt
his as yet dubious position in this company warranted At the end of the
five seconds Hunt was closing the door upon his back

Ive always loved himand I want to thank you Mr Brainard she said
with her simple directness And before Larry could make response of any
kind she shifted the subject

I really came in to see you on business Mr Brainard I hope I made
my attitude toward you clear enough last night If I did not let me
say now that I think you have made good in every particularand that I
trust you in every particular What I wished especially to say now she
went on briskly giving Larry no chance to stammer out his appreciation
is that I wish to go ahead without any delay with your proposition for
developing the Sherwood properties in New York City which we discussed
some time ago A former objection you raised is now removed you are
cleared and are free to work in the open I want you to take charge
of affairs with Dick working beside you I think it will be Dicks big
chance Ive talked it over with him this morning and hes eager for
the arrangement I hope you are not going to refuse the offer this
time

I cantnot such an offer as that Larry said huskily But Miss
Sherwood I didnt expect

Then its settled she interrupted with her brisk tone Therell be a
lot of details but well have plenty of time to talk them over later
She stood up There are some changes here at Cedar Crest which I want
begun at once and which I want you to supervise If you dont mind well
look things over now

He followed beside her along the curving graveled walks She headed
toward the cliff but he had no idea where she was leading until a sharp
turn brought them almost upon the low cottage which these last few weeks
had been Joe Ellisons home

Here is where we start our changes said the businesslike Miss
Sherwood The doors open so we might as well go right in

They stepped into a tiny entry and from thence into a little
sittingroom The room was filled with cut flowers but Larry did not
even see them For as they entered Maggie sprang up startled from a
chair and whiter than she had been before in all her life gazed at
him as if she wanted to run away She stood trembling and slender in a
linen frock of most simple and graceful lines It was Miss Sherwoods
frock though Larry did not know this already it had been decided that
all those showy Grantham gowns were never to be worn again

Once more Miss Sherwood came to the rescue of a stupendous situation
just as her tact had rescued a situation too great for words the night
before

Of course you two people now perceive that Im a fraudthat Ive got
you together by base trickery So much being admitted lets proceed
She turned on Larry Maggieweve agreed that I am to call her
thatMaggie stayed with me last night There are two beds in my room
But we didnt sleep much Mostly we talked If theres anything Maggie
didnt tell me about herself I cant guess what theres left to tell
According to herself shes terrible But thats for us to judge
personally I dont believe her She confessed that she really loved you
but that after the way shed treated you of course she wasnt fit for
you Which of course is just a girls nonsense I suppose you Mr
Brainard are thinking something of the sort regarding your own self It
is equally nonsense You both love each otheryouve both been through
a lotnothing of importance now stands between youso dont waste any
of your too short lives in coming together

She took a deep breath and went on You might as well know Mr
Brainard that Maggie is going to live with me for the presentthat of
course she is going to be a very great burden to meand it will be a
great favor to me if youll marry her soon and take her off my hands
And then the voice that had tried to keep itself brisk and even
quavered with a sudden sob For Heavens sake dear childrendont be
fools

And with that she was gone

For an instant Larry continued to gaze at Maggies slender trembling
figure But something approaching a miraclea very human miraclehad
just happened All those doubts fears indecisions unexpressed
desires agonies of selfabasement which might have delayed their
understanding and happiness for weeks and months had been swept into
nothingness by the incisive kindliness of Miss Sherwood In one minute
she had said all they might have said in months there was nothing more
to say There was nothing left of the past to discuss Before them was
only the fact of that immediate moment and the future

Tremblingly silently Larry crossed to that trembling silent figure
in white She did not retreat Tremblingly he took her hands and looked
down into her dark eyes They were now flowing tears but they met his
squarely holding back nothing The look in her eyes answered all he
desired to know just then for he gathered her tight into his arms
Wordlessly but with a sharp convulsive sob she threw her arms about
his neckand thus embracing shaken with sharp sobs they stood while
the minutes passed not a single word having been spoken And so it was
that these two both children of the storm at last came together

Presently Joe Ellison chanced to step unsuspectingly into the room
Seeing what he did he silently tiptoed out There was a garden chair
just outside his door Into this he sank and let his thin face fall into
his hands His figure shook and hot tears burned through his fingers
For his heart told him that his great dream was at last come true

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
