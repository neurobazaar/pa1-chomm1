Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a

of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Faust Part 1
by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE the greatest of German
men of letters was born at Frank fortontheMain August 28
1749 His father was a man of means and position and he
personally supervised the early education of his son The young
Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsic and Strasburg and in
1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar At the invitation
of Karl August Duke of SaxeWeimar he went in 1775 to live in
Weimar where he held a succession of political offices becoming
the Dukes chief adviser From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy
and from 179 to 1817 directed the ducal theater at Weimar He
took part in the wars against France 17923 and in the following
year began his friendship with Schiller which lasted till the latters
death in 1805 In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius From about
1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature and after a life of
extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar March 22 1832
The most important of Goethes works produced before he went to
Weimar were his tragedy Gotz von Berlichingen 1773 which
first brought him fame and The Sorrows of Young Werther a
novel which obtained enormous popularity during the socalled
Sturm und Drang period During the years at Weimar before he
knew Schiller he began Wilhelm Meister wrote the dramas
Iphigenie Egmont and Torquato Tasso and his Reinecke
Fuchs To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the
continuation of Wilhelm Meister the beautiful idyl of Hermann
and Dorothea and the Roman Elegies In the last period
between Schillers death in 1805 and his own appeared Faust
Elective Affinities his autobiographical Dichtung und
Wahrheit Poetry and Truth his Italian Journey much
scientific work and a series of treatises on German Art

Though the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection front
the titles of Goethes best known writings it suffices to show the
extraordinary fertility and versatility of his genius Rarely has a
man of letters had so full and varied a life or been capable of so
manysided a development His political and scientific activities
though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic
production yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most
diverse directions and helped to give him that balance of temper
and breadth of vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius
of the ancient or modern world

The greatest and most representative expression of Goethes
powers is without doubt to be found in his drama of Faust but
before dealing with Goethes masterpiece it is worth while to say
something of the history of the story on which it is foundedthe
most famous instance of the old and widespread legend of the man
who sold his soul to the devil The historical Dr Faust seems to
have been a selfcalled philosopher who traveled about Germany
in the first half of the sixteenth century making money by the
practise of magic fortunetelling and pretended cures He died
mysteriously about 1540 and a legend soon sprang up that the
devil by whose aid he wrought his wonders had finally carried
him off In 1587 a life of him appeared in which are attributed to
him many marvelous exploits and in which he is held up as an
awful warning against the excessive desire for secular learning and
admiration for antique beauty which characterized the humanist
movement of the time In this aspect the Faust legend is an
expression of early popular Protestantism and of its antagonism to
the scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance

While a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany the
original life was translated into English and dramatized by
Marlowe English players brought Marlowes work back to
Germany where it was copied by German actors degenerated into
spectacular farce and finally into a puppet show Through this
puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend

By the time that Goethe was twenty the Faust legend had
fascinated his imagination for three years before he went to
Weimar he had been working on scattered scenes and bits of
dialogue and though he suspended actual composition on it during
three distinct periods it was always to resume and he closed his
labors upon it only with his life Thus the period of time between
his first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years
During this period the plans for the structure and the signification
of the work inevitably underwent profound modifications and
these have naturally affected the unity of the result but on the
other hand this long companionship and persistent recurrence to
the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the
record of Goethes personality in all its richness and diversity

The drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790 then
the completed First Part appeared in 1808 and finally the Second
Part was published in 1833 the year after the authors death
Writing in Dichtung und Wahrheit of the period about 1770
when he was in Strasburg with Herder Goethe says The
significant puppetplay legend    echoed and buzzed in many
tones within me I too had drifted about in all knowledge and
early enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it I too had
made all sorts of experiments in life and had always come back
more unsatisfied and more tormented I was now carrying these
things like many others about with me and delighting myself with
them in lonely hours but without writing anything down Without
going into the details of the experience which underlies these
words we can see the be ginning of that sympathy with the hero of
the old story that was the basis of its fascination and that
accounted for Goethes departure from the traditional catastrophe
of Fausts damnation

Of the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the
legend a rough idea may be obtained from the Doctor Faustus of
Marlowe printed in the present volume As early as 1674 a life of
Faust had contained the incident of the philosophers falling in love
with a servantgirl but the developed story of Gretchen is Goethes
own The other elements added to the plot can be noted by a
comparison with Marlowe

It need hardly be said that Goethes Faust does not derive its
greatness from its conformity to the traditional standards of what a
tragedy should be He himself was accustomed to refer to it
cynically as a monstrosity and yet he put himself into it as
intensely as Dante put himself into The Divine Comedy A
partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the authors
attitude is to be found in what has been said of its manner of
composition Goethe began it in his romantic youth and availed
himself recklessly of the supernatural elements in the legend with
the disregard of reason and plausibility characteristic of the
romantic mood When he returned to it in the beginning of the new
century his artistic standards had changed and the supernaturalism
could now be tolerated only by being made symbolic Thus he
makes the career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of
the persistent striving for the ideal over the temptation to find
complete satisfaction in the sense and prepares the reader for this
interpretation by prefixing the Prologue in Heaven The
elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such scenes
as the Walpurgis Night and the Intermezzo scenes full of power
and infinitely suggestive but destructive of the unity of the play as
a tragedy of human life Yet there remains in this First Part even in
its final form much that is realistic in the best sense the carousal
in Auerbachs cellar the portrait of Martha the Eastermorning
walk the character and fate of Margaret It is such elements as
these that have appealed to the larger reading public and that have
naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage and by
virtue of these alone Faust may rank as a great drama but it is
the result of Goethes broodings on the mystery of human life
shadowed forth in the symbolic parts and elaborated with still
greater complexity and still more farreaching suggestivenessand
it must be added with deepening obscurityin the Second Part
that have given the work its place with Job with the
Prometheus Bound with The Divine Comedy and with
Hamlet





Dedication

YE wavering shapes again ye do enfold me
As erst upon my troubled sight ye stole
Shall I this time attempt to clasp to hold ye
Still for the fond illusion yearns my soul
Ye press around Come then your captive hold me
As upward from the vapoury mist ye roll
Within my breast youths throbbing pulse is bounding
Fannd by the magic breath your march surrounding

Shades fondly loved appear your train attending
And visions fair of many a blissful day
Firstlove and friendship their fond accents blending
Like to some ancient halfexpiring lay
Sorrow revives her wail of anguish sending
Back oer lifes devious labyrinthine way
And names the dear ones they whom Fate bereaving
Of lifes fair hours left me behind them grieving

They hear me not my later cadence singing
The souls to whom my earlier lays I sang
Dispersed the throng their severed flight now winging
Mute are the voices that responsive rang
For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing
Een their applause is to my heart a pang
Of old who listened to my song glad hearted
If yet they live now wander widely parted

A yearning long unfelt each impulse swaying
To yon calm spiritrealm uplifts my soul
In faltering cadence as when Zephyr playing
Fans the Aeolian harp my numbers roll
Tear follows tear my steadfast heart obeying
The tender impulse loses its control
What I possess as from afar I see
Those I have lost become realities to me





PROLOGUE FOR THE THEATRE

MANAGER DRAMATIC POET MERRYMAN

MANAGER

YE twain in trouble and distress
True friends whom I so oft have found
Say for our scheme on German ground
What prospect have we of success
Fain would I please the public win their thanks
They live and let live hence it is but meet
The posts are now erected and the planks
And all look forward to a festal treat
Their places taken they with eyebrows raisd
Sit patiently and fain would be amazd
I know the art to hit the public taste
Yet neer of failure felt so keen a dread
True they are not accustomed to the best
But then appalling the amount theyve read
How make our entertainment striking new
And yet significant and pleasing too
For to be plain I love to see the throng
As to our booth the living tide progresses
As wave on wave successive rolls along
And through heavens narrow portal forceful presses
Still in broad daylight ere the clock strikes four
With blows their way towards the box they take
And as for bread in famine at the bakers door
For tickets are content their necks to break
Such various minds the bard alone can sway
My friend oh work this miracle today

POET

Oh of the motley throng speak not before me
At whose aspect the Spirit wings its flight

Conceal the surging concourse I implore thee
Whose vortex draws us with resistless might
No to some peaceful heavenly nook restore me
Where only for the bard blooms pure delight
Where love and friendship yield their choicest blessing
Our hearts true bliss with godlike hand caressing

What in the spirits depths was there created
What shyly there the lip shaped forth in sound
A failure now with words now fitly mated
In the wild tumult of the hour is drownd
Full oft the poets thought for years bath waited
Until at length with perfect form tis crowned
What dazzles for the moment born must perish
What genuine is posterity will cherish

MERRYMAN

This cant about posterity I hate
About posterity were I to prate
Who then the living would amuse For they
Will have diversion ay and tis their due
A sprightly fellows presence at your play
Methinks should also count for something too
Whose genial wit the audience still inspires
Knows from their changeful mood no angry feeling
A wider circle he desires
To their hearts depths more surely thus appealing
To work then Give a masterpiece my friend
Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us
Sense reason feeling passion but attend
Let folly also swell the tragic chorus

MANAGER

In chief of incident enough prepare
A show they want they come to gape and stare
Spin for their eyes abundant occupation
SO that the multitude may wondering gaze
You by sheer bulk have won your reputation

By mass alone can you subdue the masses
Each then selects in time what suits his bent
Bring much you something bring for various classes
And from the house goes every one content
You give a piece abroad in pieces send it
Tis a ragoutsuccess most needs attend it
Tis easy to serve up as easy to invent
A finishd whole what boots it to present
Full soon the public will in pieces rend it

POET

How mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel
How it revolts the genuine artists mind
The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal
Is here approved on principle I find

MANAGER

Such a reproof disturbs me not a whit
Who on efficient work is bent
Must choose the fittest instrument
Consider tis soft wood you have to split
Think too for whom you write I pray
One comes to while an hour away
One from the festive board a sated guest
Others more dreaded than the rest
From journalreading hurry to the play
As to a masquerade with absent minds they press
Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging
Ladies display their persons and their dress
Actors unpaid their service bringing
What dreams beguile you on your poets height
What puts a full house in a merry mood
More closely view your patrons of the night
The half are cold the half are rude
One the play over craves a game of cards
Another a wild night in wanton joy would spend
Poor fools the muses fair regards
Why court for such a paltry end
I tell you give them more still more tis all I ask
Thus you will neer stray widely from the goal
Your audience seek to mystify cajole
To satisfy themthats a harder task
What ails thee art enraptured or distressed

POET

Depart elsewhere another servant choose
What shall the bard his godlike power abuse
Mans loftiest right kind natures high bequest
For your mean purpose basely sport away
Whence comes his mastery oer the human breast
Whence oer the elements his sway
But from the harmony that gushing from his soul
Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole
With careless hand when round her spindle Nature
Winds the interminable thread of life
When mid the clash of Being every creature
Mingles in harsh inextricable strife
Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth
In rhythmic flow to musics measurd tone
Each solitary note whose genius calleth
To swell the mighty choir in unison
Who in the raging storm sees passion lowring
Or flush of earnest thought in evenings glow
Who every blossom in sweet springtime flowering
Along the loved ones path would strow
Who Natures green familiar leaves entwining
Wreathes glorys garland won on every field
Makes sure Olympus heavenly powers combining
Mans mighty spirit in the bard reveald

MERRYMAN

Come then employ your lofty inspiration
And carry on the poets avocation
Just as we carry on a love affair
Two meet by chance are pleased they linger there
Insensibly are linkd they scarce know how
Fortune seems now propitious adverse now
Then come alternate rapture and despair
And tis a true romance ere ones aware
Just such a drama let us now compose
Plunge boldly into lifeits depths disclose
Each lives it not to many is it known
Twill interest wheresoever seizd and shown
Bright pictures but obscure their meaning
A ray of truth through error gleaming
Thus you the best elixir brew
To charm mankind and edify them too
Then youths fair blossoms crowd to view your play
And wait as on an oracle while they
The tender souls who love the melting mood
Suck from your work their melancholy food
Now this one and now that you deeply stir
Each sees the working of his heart laid bare
Their tears their laughter you command with ease
The lofty still they honour the illusive love
Your finishd gentlemen you neer can please
A growing mind alone will grateful prove

POET

Then give me back youths golden prime
When my own spirit too was growing
When from my heart th unbidden rhyme
Gushd forth a fount for ever flowing
Then shadowy mist the world conceald
And every bud sweet promise made
Of wonders yet to be reveald
As through the vales with blooms inlaid
Culling a thousand flowers I strayd
Naught had I yet a rich profusion
The thirst for truth joy in each fond illusion
Give me unquelld those impulses to prove
Rapture so deep its ecstasy was pain
The power of hate the energy of love
Give me oh give me back my youth again

MERRYMAN

Youth my good friend you certainly require
When foes in battle round are pressing
When a fair maid her heart on fire
Hangs on your neck with fond caressing
When from afar the victors crown
To reach the hardwon goal inciteth
When from the whirling dance to drown
Your sense the nights carouse inviteth
But the familiar chords among
Boldly to sweep with graceful cunning
While to its goal the verse along
Its winding path is sweetly running
This task is yours old gentlemen today
Nor are you therefore less in reverence held
Age does not make us childish as folk say
It finds us genuine children een in eld

MANAGER

A truce to words mere empty sound
Let deeds at length appear my friends
While idle compliments you round
You might achieve some useful ends
Why talk of the poetic vein
Who hesitates will never know it
If bards ye are as ye maintain
Now let your inspiration show it
To you is known what we require
Strong drink to sip is our desire
Come brew me such without delay
Tomorrow sees undone what happens not today
Still forward press nor ever tire
The possible with steadfast trust
Resolve should by the forelock grasp
Then she will neer let go her clasp
And labours on because she must
Therefore in bringing out your play
Nor scenes nor mechanism spare
Heavens lamps employ the greatest and the least
Be lavish of the stellar lights
Water and fire and rocky heights
Spare not at all nor birds nor beast
Thus let creations ample sphere
Forthwith in this our narrow booth appear
And with considerate speed through fancys spell
Journey from heaven thence through the world to hell





PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN

THE LORD THE HEAVENLY HOSTS
Afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES

Time three Archangels come forward

RAPHAEL

THE Sun in ancient guise competing
With brother spheres in rival song
With thundermarch his orb completing
Moves his predestind course along
His aspect to the powers supernal
Gives strength though fathom him none may
Transcending thought the works eternal
Are fair as on the primal day

GABRIEL

With speed thought baffling unabating
Earths splendour whirls in circling flight
Its Edenbrightness alternating
With solemn aweinspiring night
Oceans broad waves in wild commotion
Against the rocks deep base are hurled
And with the spheres both rock and ocean
Eternally are swiftly whirled

MICHAEL

And tempests roar in emulation
From sea to land from land to sea
And raging form without cessation
A chain of wondrous agency
Full in the thunders path careering

Flaring the swift destructions play
But Lord Thy servants are revering
The mild procession of thy day

THE THREE

Thine aspect to the powers supernal
Gives strength though fathom thee none may
And all thy works sublime eternal
Are fair as on the primal day

MEPHISTOPHELES

Since thou O Lord approachest us once more
And how it fares with us to ask art fain
Since thou hast kindly welcomd me of yore
Thou seest me also now among thy train
Excuse me fine harangues I cannot make
Though all the circle look on me with scorn
My pathos soon thy laughter would awake
Hadst thou the laughing mood not long forsworn
Of suns and worlds I nothing have to say
I see alone mankinds selftorturing pains
The little worldgod still the selfsame stamp retains
And is as wondrous now as on the primal day
Better he might have fared poor wight
Hadst thou not given him a gleam of heavenly light
Reason he names it and doth so
Use it than brutes more brutish still to grow
With deference to your grace he seems to me
Like any longlegged grasshopper to be
Which ever flies and flying springs
And in the grass its ancient ditty sings
Would he but always in the grass repose
In every heap of dung he thrusts his nose

THE LORD

Hast thou naught else to say Is blame
In coming here as ever thy sole aim
Does nothing on the earth to thee seem right

MEPHISTOPHELES

No Lord I find things there as ever in sad plight
Men in their evil days move my compassion
Such sorry things to plague is nothing worth

THE LORD

Knowst thou my servant Faust

MEPHISTOPHELES

The doctor

THE LORD

Right

MEPHISTOPHELES

He serves thee truly in a wondrous fashion
Poor fool His food and drink are not of earth
An inward impulse hurries him afar
Himself half conscious of his frenzied mood
From heaven claimeth he the fairest star
And from the earth craves every highest good
And all thats near and all thats far
Fails to allay the tumult in his blood

THE LORD

Though in perplexity he serves me now
I soon will lead him where more light appears
When buds the sapling doth the gardener know
That flowers and fruit will deck the coming years

MEPHISTOPHELES

What wilt thou wager Him thou yet shall lose
If leave to me thou wilt but give
Gently to lead him as I choose

THE LORD

So long as he on earth doth live
So long tis not forbidden thee
Man still must err while he doth strive

MEPHISTOPHELES

I thank you for not willingly
I traffic with the dead and still aver
That youths plump blooming cheek I very much prefer
Im not at home to corpses tis my way
Like cats with captive mice to toy and play

THE LORD

Enough tis granted thee Divert
This mortal spirit from his primal source
Him canst thou seize thy power exert
And lead him on thy downward course
Then stand abashd when thou perforce must own
A good man in his darkest aberration
Of the right path is conscious still

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis done Full soon thoult see my exultation
As for my bet no fears I entertain
And if my end I finally should gain
Excuse my triumphing with all my soul
Dust he shall eat ay and with relish take
As did my cousin the renowned snake

THE LORD

Here too thourt free to act without control
I neer have cherished hate for such as thee
Of all the spirits who deny
The scoffer is least wearisome to me
Ever too prone is man activity to shirk
In unconditioned rest he fain would live
Hence this companion purposely I give
Who stirs excites and must as devil work
But ye the genuine sons of heaven rejoice
In the full living beauty still rejoice
May that which works and lives the evergrowing
In bonds of love enfold you mercyfraught
And Seemings changeful forms around you flowing
Do ye arrest in everduring thought
Heaven closes the Archangels disperse

MEPHISTOPHELES alone

The ancient one I like sometimes to see
And not to break with him am always civil
Tis courteous in so great a lord as he
To speak so kindly even to the devil

PART I

NIGHT

A high vaulted narrow Gothic chamber
FAUST restless seated at his desk

FAUST

I HAVE alas Philosophy
Medicine Jurisprudence too
And to my cost Theology
With ardent labour studied through
And here I stand with all my lore
Poor fool no wiser than before
Magister doctor styled indeed
Already these ten years I lead
Up down across and to and fro
My pupils by the noseand learn
That we in truth can nothing know
That in my heart like fire doth burn
Tis true Ive more cunning than all your dull tribe
Magister and doctor priest parson and scribe
Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me
Neither can devil nor hell now appal me
Hence also my heart must all pleasure forego
I may not pretend aught rightly to know
I may not pretend through teaching to find
A means to improve or convert mankind
Then I have neither goods nor treasure
No worldly honour rank or pleasure
No dog in such fashion would longer live
Therefore myself to magic I give
In hope through spiritvoice and might
Secrets now veiled to bring to light
That I no more with aching brow
Need speak of what I nothing know
That I the force may recognise
That binds creations inmost energies
Her vital powers her embryo seeds survey
And fling the trade in empty words away
O fullorbd moon did but thy rays
Their last upon mine anguish gaze
Beside this desk at dead of night
Oft have I watched to hail thy light
Then pensive friend oer book and scroll
With soothing power thy radiance stole
In thy dear light ah might I climb
Freely some mountain height sublime
Round mountain caves with spirits ride
In thy mild haze oer meadows glide
And purged from knowledgefumes renew
My spirit in thy healing dew
Woes me still prisond in the gloom
Of this abhorrd and musty room
Where heavens dear light itself doth pass
But dimly through the painted glass
Hemmed in by bookheaps piled around
Wormeaten hid neath dust and mould
Which to the high vaults topmost bound
A smokestained paper doth enfold
With boxes round thee piled and glass
And many a useless instrument
With old ancestral lumber blent
This is thy world a world alas
And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart
With tightend pressure in thy breast
Why the dull ache will not depart
By which thy lifepulse is oppressd
Instead of natures living sphere
Created for mankind of old
Brute skeletons surround thee here
And dead mens bones in smoke and mould

Up Forth into the distant land
Is not this book of mystery
By Nostradamus proper hand
An allsufficient guide Thoult see
The courses of the stars unrolld
When nature doth her thoughts unfold
To thee thy soul shall rise and seek
Communion high with her to hold
As spirit doth with spirit speak
Vain by dull poring to divine
The meaning of each hallowd sign
Spirits I feel you hovring near
Make answer if my voice ye hear

He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos

Ah at this spectacle through every sense
What sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing
I feel new rapture hallowd and intense
Through every nerve and vein with ardour glowing
Was it a god who characterd this scroll
The tumult in my spirit healing
Oer my sad heart with rapture stealing
And by a mystic impulse to my soul
The powers of nature all around revealing
Am I a God What light intense
In these pure symbols do I see
Nature exert her vital energy
Now of the wise mans words I learn the sense

Unlockd the spiritworld is lying
Thy sense is shut thy heart is dead
Up scholar lave with zeal undying
Thine earthly breast in the morningred
He contemplates the sign

How all things live and work and ever blending
Weave one vast whole from Beings ample range
How powers celestial rising and descending
Their golden buckets ceaseless interchange
Their flight on rapturebreathing pinions winging
From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing
Through the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing

A wondrous show but ah a show alone
Where shall I grasp thee infinite nature where
Ye breasts ye fountains of all life whereon
Hang heaven and earth from which the withered heart
For solace yearns ye still impart
Your sweet and fostering tideswhere are yewhere
Ye gush and must I languish in despair
He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently and perceives
the sign of the Earthspirit

How all unlike the influence of this sign
Earthspirit thou to me art nigher
Een now my strength is rising higher
Een now I glow as with new wine
Courage I feel abroad the world to dare

The woe of earth the bliss of earth to bear
With storms to wrestle brave the lightnings glare
And mid the crashing shipwreck not despair

Clouds gather over me
The moon conceals her light
The lamp is quenchd
Vapours are rising
Quivring round my head
Flash the red beams
Down from the vaulted roof
A shuddering horror floats
And seizes me
I feel it spirit prayercompelld tis thou
Art hovering near
Unveil thyself
Ha How my heart is riven now
Each sense with eager palpitation
Is straind to catch some new sensation
I feel my heart surrenderd unto thee
Thou must Thou must Though life should be the fee
He seizes the book and pronounces mysteriously the sign
of the spirit A ruddy flame flashes up the spirit appears in the
flame

SPIRIT

Who calls me
FAUST turning aside
Dreadful shape

SPIRIT

With might thou hast compelled me to appear
Long hast been sucking at my sphere
And now

FAUST

Woes me I cannot bear the sight

SPIRIT

To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation
My voice to hear to gaze upon my brow
Me doth thy strong entreaty bow
Lo I am here IWhat cowering agitation
Grasps thee the demigod Wheres now the souls deep cry
Where is the breast which in its depths a world conceivd
And bore and cherished which with ecstasy
To rank itself with us the spirits heaved
Where art thou Faust whose voice I heard resound
Who towards me pressd with energy profound
Art thou he Thouwho by my breath art blighted
Who in his spirits depths affrighted
Trembles a crushd and writhing worm

FAUST

Shall I yield thing of flame to thee
Faust and thine equal I am he

SPIRIT

In the currents of life in actions storm
I float and I wave
With billowy motion
Birth and the grave
A limitless ocean
A constant weaving
With change still rife
A restless heaving
A glowing life
Thus times whirring loom unceasing I ply
And weave the lifegarment of deity

FAUST

Thou restless spirit dost from end to end
Oersweep the world how near I feel to thee

SPIRIT

Thourt like the spirit thou dost comprehend
Not me Vanishes

FAUST deeply moved

I Gods own image
And not rank with thee A knock
Oh death I know ittis my famulus
My fairest fortune now escapes
That all these visionary shapes
A soulless groveller should banish thus
WAGNER in his dressing gown and nightcap a lamp
in his hand FAUST turns round reluctantly

WAGNER

Pardon I heard you here declaim
A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read
Improvement in this art is now my aim
For nowadays it much avails Indeed
An actor oft Ive heard it said as teacher
May give instruction to a preacher

FAUST

Ay if your priest should be an actor too
As not improbably may come to pass

WAGNER

When in his study pent the whole year through
Man views the world as through an optic glass
On a chance holiday and scarcely then
How by persuasion can he govern men

FAUST

If feeling prompt not if it doth not flow
Fresh from the spirits depths with strong control
Swaying to rapture every listeners soul
Idle your toil the chase you may forego
Brood oer your task Together glue
Cook from anothers feast your own ragout
Still prosecute your paltry game
And fan your ashheaps into flame
Thus childrens wonder youll excite
And apes if such your appetite
But that which issues from the heart alone
Will bend tile hearts of others to your own

WAGNER

The speaker in delivery will find
Success alone I still am far behind

FAUST

A worthy object still pursue
Be not a hollow tinkling fool
Sound understanding judgment true
Find utterance without art or rule
And when in earnest you are moved to speak
Then is it needful cunning words to seek
Your fine harangues so polishd in their kind
Wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist
Are unrefreshing as the empty wind
Whistling through witherd leaves and autumn mist

WAGNER

Oh God How long is art
Our life how short With earnest zeal
Still as I ply the critics task I feel
A strange oppression both of head and heart
The very means how hardly are they won
By which we to the fountains rise
And haply ere one half the course is run
Checkd in his progress the poor devil dies

FAUST

Parchment is that the sacred fount whence roll
Waters he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed
Oh if it gush not from thine inmost soul
Thou has not won the liferestoring draught

WAGNER

Your pardon tis delightful to transport
Oneself into the spirit of the past
To see in times before us how a wise man thought
And what a glorious height we have achieved at last

FAUST
Ay truly even to the loftiest star
To us my friend the ages that are passd
A book with seven seals closefastend are
And what the spirit of the times men call
Is merely their own spirit after all
Wherein distorted oft the times are glassd
Then truly tis a sight to grieve the soul
At the first glance we fly it in dismay
A very lumberroom a rubbishhole
At best a sort of mockheroic play
With saws pragmatical and maxims sage
To suit the puppets and their mimic stage

WAGNER

But then the world and man his heart and brain
Touching these things all men would something know

FAUST

Ay what mong men as knowledge doth obtain
Who on the child its true name dares bestow
The few who somewhat of these things have known
Who their full hearts unguardedly reveald
Nor thoughts nor feelings from the mob conceald
Have died on crosses or in flames been thrown
Excuse me friend far now the night is spent
For this time we must say adieu

WAGNER

Still to watch on I had been well content
Thus to converse so learnedly with you
But as tomorrow will be Easterday
Some further questions grant I pray
With diligence to study still I fondly cling
Already I know much but would know everything
Exit

FAUST alone

How him alone all hope abandons never
To empty trash who clings with zeal untired
With greed for treasure gropes and joyinspird
Exults if earthworms second his endeavour

And dare a voice of merely human birth
Een here where shapes immortal throngd intrude
Yet ah thou poorest of the sons of earth
For once I een to thee feel gratitude
Despair the power of sense did wellnigh blast
And thou didst save me ere I sank dismayd
So giantlike the vision seemd so vast
I felt myself shrink dwarfd as I surveyd

I Gods own image from this toil of clay
Already freed with eager joy who haild
The mirror of eternal truth unveild
Mid light effulgent and celestial day
I more than cherub whose unfetterd soul
With penetrative glance aspird to flow
Through natures veins and still creating know
The life of godshow am I punishd now
One thunderword hath hurld me from the goal

Spirit I dare not lift me to thy sphere
What though my power compelld thee to appear
My art was powerless to detain thee here
In that great moment rapturefraught
I felt myself so small so great
Fiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought
Back on humanitys uncertain fate
Wholl teach me now What ought Ito forego
Ought I that impulse to obey
Alas our every deed as well as every woe
Impedes the tenor of lifes onward way

Een to the noblest by the soul conceivd
Some feelings cling of baser quality
And when the goods of this world are achievd
Each nobler aim is termed a cheat a lie
Our aspirations our souls genuine life
Grow torpid in the din of earthly strife

Though youthful phantasy while hope inspires
Stretch oer the infinite her wing sublime
A narrow compass limits her desires
When wreckd our fortunes in the gulf of time
In the deep heart of man care builds her nest
Oer secret woes she broodeth there
Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth joy and rest
Still is she wont some new disguise to wear
She may as house and court as wife and child appear
As dagger poison fire and flood
Imagined evils chill thy blood
And what thou neer shall lose oer that dost shed the tear
I am not like the gods Feel it I must
Im like the earthworm writhing in the dust
Which as on dust it feeds its native fare
Crushed neath the passers tread lies buried there

Is it not dust wherewith this lofty wall
With hundred shelves confines me round
Rubbish in thousand shapes may I not call
What in this mothworld doth my being bound
Here what doth fail me shall I find
Read in a thousand tomes that everywhere
Selftorture is the lot of humankind
With but one mortal happy here and there
Thou hollow skull that grin what should it say
But that thy brain like mine of old perplexed
Still yearning for the truth hath sought the light of day
And in the twilight wandered sorely vexed
Ye instruments forsooth ye mock at me
With wheel and cog and ring and cylinder
To natures portals ye should be the key
Cunning your wards and yet the bolts ye fail to stir
Inscrutable in broadest light
To be unveild by force she doth refuse
What she reveals not to thy mental sight
Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws
Old useless furnitures yet stand ye here
Because my sire ye served now dead and gone
Old scroll the smoke of years dost wear
So long as oer this desk the sorry lamp hath shone
Better my little means hath squandered quite away
Than burdend by that little here to sweat and groan
Wouldst thou possess thy heritage essay
By use to render it thine own
What we employ not but impedes our way
That which the hour creates that can it use alone

But wherefore to yon Spot is riveted my gaze
Is yonder flasket there a magnet to my sight
Whence this mild radiance that around me plays
As when mid forest gloom reigneth the moons soft light

Hail precious phial Thee with reverent awe
Down from thine old receptacle I draw
Science in thee I hail and human art
Essence of deadliest powers refind and sure
Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure
Now in thy masters need thy grace impart
I gaze on thee my pain is lulld to rest
I grasp thee calmd the tumult in my breast
The floodtide of my spirit ebbs away
Onward Im summond oer a boundless main
Calm at my feet expands the glassy plain
To shores unknown allures a brighter day

Lo where a car of fire on airy pinion
Comes floating towards me I Im prepard to fly
By a new track through ethers wide dominion
To distant spheres of pure activity
This life intense this godlike ecstasy
Worm that thou art such rapture canst thou earn
Only resolve with courage stern and high
Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn
Dare with determind will to burst the portals
Past which in terror others fain would steal
Now is the time through deeds to show that mortals
The calm sublimity of gods can feel
To shudder not at yonder dark abyss
Where phantasy creates her own selftorturing brood
Right onward to the yawning gulf to press
Around whose narrow jaws rolleth hells fiery flood
With glad resolve to take the fatal leap
Though danger threaten thee to sink in endless sleep

Pure crystal goblet forth I draw thee now
From out thine antiquated case where thou
Forgotten hast reposed for many a year
Oft at my fathers revels thou didst shine
To glad the earnest guests was thine
As each to other passed the generous cheer
The gorgeous brede of figures quaintly wrought
Which he who quaffd must first in rhyme expound
Then drain the goblet at one draught profound
Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought
I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now
Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show
Here is a juice makes drunk without delay
Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill
Let this last draught the product of my skill
My own free choice be quaffd with resolute will
A solemn festive greeting to the coming day
He places the goblet to his mouth
Tue ringing of bells and choral voices

Chorus of ANGELS

Christ is arisen
Mortal all hail to thee
Thou whom mortality
Earths sad reality
Held as in prison

FAUST

What hum melodious what clear silvery chime
Thus draws the goblet from my lips away
Ye deeptond bells do ye with voice sublime
Announce the solemn dawn of Easterday
Sweet choir are ye the hymn of comfort singing
Which once around the darkness of the grave
From seraphvoices in glad triumph ringing
Of a new covenant assurance gave

CHORUS OF WOMEN

We his truehearted
With spices and myrrh
Embalmed the departed
And swathed him with care
Here we conveyed Him
Our Master so dear
Alas Where we laid Him
The Christ is not here

CHORUS OF ANGELS

Christ is arisen
Blessed the loving one
Who from earths trial throes
Healing and strengthening woes
Soars as from prison

FAUST

Wherefore ye tones celestial sweet and strong
Come ye a dweller in the dust to seek
Ring out your chimes believing crowds among
The message well I hear my faith alone is weak
From faith her darling miracle hath sprung
Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar
Whence sound the tidings of great joy
And yet with this sweet strain familiar when a boy
Back it recalleth me to life once more
Then would celestial love with holy kiss
Come oer me in the Sabbaths stilly hour
While fraught with solemn meaning and mysterious
Chimd the deepsounding bell and prayer was bliss
A yearning impulse undefind yet dear
Drove me to wander on through wood and field
With heaving breast and many a burning tear
I felt with holy joy a world reveald
Gay sports and festive hours proclaimd with joyous pealing
This Easter hymn in days of old
And fond remembrance now doth me with childlike feeling
Back from the last the solemn step withhold
O still sound on thou sweet celestial strain
The teardrop flowsEarth I am thine again

CHORUS OF DISCIPLES

He whom we mourned as dead
Living and glorious
From the dark grave bath fled
Oer death victorious
Almost creative bliss
Waits on his growing powers
Ah Him on earth we miss
Sorrow and grief are ours
Yearning he left his own
Mid sore annoy
Ah we must needs bemoan
Master thy joy

CHORUS OF ANGELS

Christ is arisen
Redeemd from decay
The bonds which imprison
Your souls rend away
Praising the Lord with zeal
By deeds that love reveal
Like brethren true and leal
Sharing the daily meal
To all that sorrow feel
Whispring of heavens weal
Still is the master near
Still is he here

BEFORE THE GATE
Promenaders of all sorts pass out

ARTISANS

Why choose ye that direction pray

OTHERS

To the huntinglodge were on our way

THE FIRST

We towards the mill are strolling on

A MECHANIC

A walk to Wasserhof were best

A SECOND

The road is not a pleasant one

THE OTHERS

What will you do

A THIRD

Ill join the rest

A FOURTH

Lets up to Burghof there youll find good cheer
The prettiest maidens and the best of beer
And brawls of a prime sort

A FIFTH

You scapegrace How
Your skin still itching for a row
Thither I will not go I loathe the place

SERVANT GIRL

No no I to the town my steps retrace

ANOTHER

Near yonder poplars he is sure to be

THE FIRST

And if he is what matters it to me
With you hell walk hell dance with none but you
And with your pleasures what have I to do

THE SECOND

Today he will not be alone he said
His friend would be with him the curlyhead

STUDENT

Why how those buxom girls step on
Come brother we will follow them anon
Strong beer a damsel smartly dressd
Stinging tobaccothese I love the best

BURGHERS DAUGHTER

Look at those handsome fellows there
Tis really shameful I declare
The very best society they shun
After those servant girls forsooth to run

SECOND STUDENT to the first

Not quite so fast for in our rear
Two girls welldressd are drawing near
Not far from us the one doth dwell
And sooth to say II like her well
They walk demurely yet youll see
That they will let us join them presently

THE FIRST

Not I restraints of all kinds I detest
Quick let us catch the wildgame ere it flies
The hand on Saturday the mop that plies
Will on the Sunday fondle you the best

BURGHER

No this new Burgomaster I like him not God knows
Now hes in office daily more arrogant he grows
And for the town what doth he do for it
Are not things worse from day to day
To more restraints we must submit
And taxes more than ever pay

BEGGAR sings

Kind gentleman and ladies fair
So rosycheekd and trimly dressd
Be pleasd to listen to my prayer
Relieve and pity the distressd
Let me not vainly sing my lay
His hearts most glad whose hand is free
Now when all men keep holiday
Should be a harvestday to me

ANOTHER BURGHER

On holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting
Than chatting about war and wars alarms
When folk in Turkey up in arms
Far off are gainst each other fighting
We at the window stand our glasses drain
And watch adown the stream the painted vessels gliding
Then joyful we at eve come home again
And peaceful times we bless peace longabiding

THIRD BURGHER

Ay neighbour So let matters stand for me
There they may scatter one anothers brains
And wild confusion round them see
So here at home in quiet all remains

OLD WOMAN to the BURGHERS DAUGHTERS

Heyday How smart The fresh young blood
Who would not fall in love with you
Not quite so proud Tis well and good
And what you wish that I could help you to

BURGHERS DAUGHTER

Come Agatha I care not to be seen
Walking in public with these witches True
My future lover last St Andrews Een
In flesh and blood she brought before my view

ANOTHER

And mine she showd me also in the glass
A soldiers figure with companions bold
I look around I seek him as I pass
In vain his form I nowhere can behold

SOLDIERS

Fortress with turrets
And walls high in air
Damsel disdainful
Haughty and fair
These be my prey
Bold is the venture
Costly the pay

Hark how the trumpet
Thither doth call us
Where either pleasure
Or death may befall us
Hail to the tumult
Lifes in the field
Damsel and fortress
To us must yield
Bold is the venture
Costly the pay
Gaily the soldier
Marches away

FAUST and WAGNER

FAUST

Loosed from their fetters are streams and rills
Through the gracious springtides allquickening glow
Hopes budding joy in the vale doth blow
Old Winter back to the savage hills
Withdraweth his force decrepid now
Thence only impotent icy grains
Scatters he as he wings his flight
Striping with sleet the verdant plains
But the sun endureth no trace of white
Everywhere growth and movement are rife
All things investing with hues of life
Though flowers are lacking varied of dye
Their colours the motly throng supply
Turn thee around and from this height
Back to the town direct thy sight
Forth from the hollow gloomy gate
Stream forth the masses in bright array
Gladly seek they the sun today
The Lords Resurrection they celebrate
For they themselves have risen with joy

From tenement sordid from cheerless room
From bonds of toil from care and annoy
From gable and roofs oerhanging gloom
From crowded alley and narrow street
And from the churches awebreathing night
All now have come forth into the light
Look only look on nimble feet
Through garden and field how spread the throng
How oer the rivers ample sheet
Many a gay wherry glides along
And see deep sinking in the tide
Pushes the last boat now away
Een from yon far hills pathworn side
Flash the bright hues of garments gay
Hark Sounds of village mirth arise
This is the peoples paradise

Both great and small send up a cheer
Here am I man I feel it here

WAGNER

Sir Doctor in a walk with you
Theres honour and instruction too
Yet here alone I care not to resort
Because I coarseness hate of every sort
This fiddling shouting skittling I detest
I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng
They roar as by the evil one possessd
And call it pleasure call it song

PEASANTS under the lindentree
Dance and song
The shepherd for the dance was dressd
With ribbon wreath and coloured vest
A gallant show displaying
And round about the lindentrees
They footed it right merrily Juchhe Juchhe
Juchheisa Heisa He
So fiddlebow was braying

Our swain amidst the circle pressd
He pushd a maiden trimly dressd
And joggd her with his elbow
The buxom damsel turnd her head
Now thats a stupid trick she said Juchhe Juchhe
Juchhesia Heisa He
Dont be so rude good fellow

Swift in the circle they advanced
They danced to right to left they danced
And all the skirts were swinging
And they grew red and they grew warm
Panting they rested arm in arm Juchhe Juchhe
Juchheisa Heisa He
To hip their elbow bringing

Dont make so free How many a maid
Has been betrothd and then betrayd
And has repented after
Yet still he flatterd her aside
And from the linden far and wide Juchhe Juchhe
Juchheisa Heisa He
Rang fiddlebow and laughter

OLD PEASANT

Doctor tis really kind of you
To condescend to come this way
A highly learned man like you
To join our mirthful throng today
Our fairest cup I offer you
Which we with sparkling drink have crownd
And pledging you I pray aloud
That every drop within its round

While it your present thirst allays
May swell the number of your days

FAUST

I take the cup you kindly reach
Thanks and prosperity to each
The crowd gather round in a circle

OLD PEASANT

Ay truly tis well done that you
Our festive meeting thus attend
You who in evil days of yore
So often showd yourself our friend
Full many a one stands living here
Who from the fevers deadly blast
Your father rescud when his skill
The fatal sickness stayd at last
A young man then each house you sought
Where reignd the mortal pestilence
Corpse after corpse was carried forth
But still unscathd you issued thence

Sore then your trials and severe
The Helper yonder aids the helper here

ALL

Heaven bless the trusty friend and long
To help the poor his life prolong

FAUST

To Him above in homage bend
Who prompts the helper and Who help doth send
He proceeds with WAGNER

WAGNER

What feelings great man must thy breast inspire
At homage paid thee by this crowd Thrice blest
Who from the gifts by him possessed
Such benefit can draw The sire
Thee to his boy with reverence shows
They press around inquire advance
Hushd is the fiddle checkd the dance
Where thou dost pass they stand in rows
And each aloft his bonnet throws
But little fails and they to thee
As though the Host came by would bend the knee

FAUST

A few steps further up to yonder stone
Here rest we from our walk In times long past
Absorbd in thought here oft I sat alone
And disciplind myself with prayer and fast
Then rich in hope with faith sincere
With sighs and hands in anguish pressd
The end of that sore plague with many a tear
From heavens dread Lord I sought to wrest
The crowds applause assumes a scornful tone
Oh couldst thou in my inner being read
How little either sire or son
Of such renown deserves the meed
My sire of good repute and sombre mood
Oer natures powers and every mystic zone
With honest zeal but methods of his own
With toil fantastic loved to brood
His time in dark alchemic cell
With brother adepts he would spend
And there antagonists compel
Through numberless receipts to blend
A ruddy lion there a suitor bold
In tepid bath was with the lily wed
Thence both while open flames around them rolld
Were torturd to another bridal bed
Was then the youthful queen descried
With varied colours in the flask
This was our medicine the patients died
Who were restored none cared to ask
With our infernal mixture thus ere long
These hills and peaceful vales among
We ragd more fiercely than the pest
Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give
They pined away I yet must live
To hear the reckless murderers blest

WAGNER

Why let this thought your soul oercast
Can man do more than with nice skill
With firm and conscientious will
Practise the art transmitted from the past
If thou thy sire dost honour in thy youth
His lore thou gladly wilt receive
In manhood dost thou spread the bounds of truth
Then may thy son a higher goal achieve

FAUST

How blest in whom the fond desire
From errors sea to rise hope still renews
What a man knows not that he doth require
And what he knoweth that he cannot use
But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw
Oer the calm beauty of this hour serene
In the rich sunset see how brightly glow
Yon cottage homes girt round with verdant green
Slow sinks the orb the day is now no more
Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life
Oh for a pinion from the earth to soar
And after ever after him to strive
Then should I see the world below
Bathed in the deathless eveningbeams
The vales reposing every height aglow
The silver brooklets meeting golden streams
The savage mountain with its cavernd side
Bars not my godlike progress Lo the ocean
Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion
To my rapt vision opes its ample tide
But now at length the god appears to sink
A newborn impulse wings my flight
Onward I press his quenchless light to drink
The day before me and behind the night
The pathless waves beneath and over me the skies
Fair dream it vanishd with the parting day
Alas that when on spiritwing we rise
No wing material lifts our mortal clay
But tis our inborn impulse deep and strong
Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight
When far above us pours its thrilling song
The skylark lost in azure light
When on extended wing amain
Oer pinecrownd height the eagle soars
And over moor and lake the crane
Still striveth towards its native shores

WAGNER

To strange conceits oft I myself must own
But impulse such as this I neer have known
Nor woods nor fields can long our thoughts engage
Their wings I envy not the featherd kind
Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind
Bear us from book to book from page to page
Then winter nights grow cheerful keen delight
Warms every limb and ah when we unroll
Some old and precious parchment at the sight
All heaven itself descends upon the soul

FAUST

Thy heart by one sole impulse is possessd
Unconscious of the other still remain
Two souls alas are lodgd within my breast
Which struggle there for undivided reign
One to the world with obstinate desire
And closelycleaving organs still adheres
Above the mist the other doth aspire
With sacred vehemence to purer spheres
Oh are there spirits in the air
Who float twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding
Stoop hither from your golden atmosphere
Lead me to scenes new life and fuller yielding
A magic mantle did I but possess
Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings
Id prize it far beyond the costliest dress
Nor would I change it for the robe of kings

WAGNER

Call not the spirits who on mischief wait
Their troop familiar streaming through the air
From every quarter threaten mans estate
And danger in a thousand forms prepare
They drive impetuous from the frozen north
With fangs sharppiercing and keen arrowy tongue
From the ungenial east they issue forth
And prey with parching breath upon thy lungs
If waftd on the deserts flaming wing
They from the south heap fire upon the brain
Refreshment from the west at first they bring
Anon to drown thyself and field and plain
In wait for mischief they are prompt to hear
With guileful purpose our behests obey
Like ministers of grace they oft appear
And lisp like angels to betray
But let us hence Grey eve doth all things blend

The air grows chill the mists descend
Tis in the evening first our home we prize
Why stand you thus and gaze with wondering eyes
What in the gloom thus moves you

FAUST

Yon black hound
Seest thou through corn and stubble scampering round

WAGNER

Ive markd him long naught strange in him I see

FAUST

Note him What takest thou the brute to be

WAGNER

But for a poodle whom his instinct serves
His masters track to find once more

FAUST

Dost mark how round us with wide spiral curves
He wheels each circle closer than before
And if I err not he appears to me
A line of fire upon his track to leave

WAGNER

Naught but a poodle black of hue I see
Tis some illusion doth your sight deceive

FAUST

Methinks a magic coil our feet around
He for a future snare doth lightly spread

WAGNER

FAUST

The circle narrows hes already near

WAGNER

A dog dost see no spectre have we here
He growls doubts lays him on his belly too
And wags his tailas dogs are wont to do

FAUST

Come hither Sirrah join our company

WAGNER

A very poodle he appears to be
Thou standest still for thee hell wait
Thou speakst to him he fawns upon thee straight
Aught thou mayst lose again hell bring
And for thy stick will into water spring

FAUST

Thourt right indeed no traces now I see
Whatever of a spirits agency
Tis trainingnothing more

WAGNER

A dog well taught
Een by the wisest of us may be sought
Ay to your favour hes entitled too
Apt scholar of the students tis his due
They enter the gate of the town

STUDY
FAUST entering with the poodle

Now field and meadow Ive forsaken
Oer them deep night her veil doth draw
In us the better soul doth waken
With feelings of foreboding awe
All lawless promptings deeds unholy
Now slumber and all wild desires
The love of man doth sway us wholly
And love to God the soul inspires

Peace poodle peace Scamper not thus obey me
Why at the threshold snuffest thou so
Behind the stove now quietly lay thee
My softest cushion to thee Ill throw
As thou without didst please and amuse me
Running and frisking about on the hill
So tendance now I will not refuse thee
A welcome guest if thoult be still

Ah when the friendly taper gloweth
Once more within our narrow cell
Then in the heart itself that knoweth
A light the darkness doth dispel
Reason her voice resumes returneth
Hopes gracious bloom with promise rife
For streams of life the spirit yearneth
Ah for the very fount of life

Poodle snarl not with the tone that arises
Hallowd and peaceful my soul within
Accords not thy growl thy bestial din
We find it not strange that man despises
What he conceives not
That he the good and fair misprizes
Finding them often beyond his ken
Will the dog snarl at them like men

But ah Despite my will it stands confessed
Contentment welleth up no longer in my breast
Yet wherefore must the stream alas so soon be dry
That we once more athirst should lie
Full oft this sad experience hath been mine
Nathless the want admits of compensation
For things above the earth we learn to pine
Our spirits yearn for revelation
Which nowhere burns with purer beauty blent

Than here in the New Testament
To ope the ancient text an impulse strong
Impels me and its sacred lore
With honest purpose to explore
And render into my loved German tongue
He opens a volume and applies himself to it
Tis writ In the beginning was the Word
I pause perplexd Who now will help afford
I cannot the mere Word so highly prize
I must translate it otherwise
If by the spirit guided as I read
In the beginning was the Sense Take heed
The import of this primal sentence weigh
Lest thy too hasty pen be led astray
Is force creative then of Sense the dower
In the beginning was the Power
Thus should it stand yet while the line I trace
A something warns me once more to efface
The spirit aids from anxious scruples freed
I write In the beginning was the Deed

Am I with thee my room to share
Poodle thy barking now forbear
Forbear thy howling
Comrade so noisy ever growling
I cannot suffer here to dwell
One or the other mark me well
Forthwith must leave the cell
Im loath the guestright to withhold
The doors ajar the passage clear
But what must now mine eyes behold
Are natures laws suspended here
Real is it or a phantom show
In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow
He lifts himself with threatning mien
In likeness of a dog no longer seen
What spectre have I harbourd thus
Huge as a hippopotamus
With fiery eye terrific tooth
Ah I now I know thee sure enough
For such a base halfhellish brood
The key of Solomon is good

SPIRITS without
Capturd there within is one
Stay without and follow none
Like a fox in iron snare
Hells old lynx is quaking there
But take heed
Hover round above below
To and fro
Then from durance is he freed
Can ye aid him spirits all
Leave him not in mortal thrall
Many a time and oft bath he
Served us when at liberty

FAUST

The monster to confront at first
The spell of Four must be rehearsd

Salamander shall kindle
Writhe nymph of the wave
In air sylph shall dwindle
And Kobold shall slave

Who doth ignore
The primal Four
Nor knows aright
Their use and might
Oer spirits will he
Neer master be

Vanish in the fiery glow
Salamander
Rushingly together flow
Undine
Shimmer in the meteors gleam
Sylphide
Hither bring thine homely aid

Incubus Incubus
Step forth I do adjure thee thus
None of the Four
Lurks in the beast
He grins at me untroubled as before
I have not hurt him in the least
A spell of fear
Thou now shalt hear
Art thou comrade fell
Fugitive from hell

See then this sign
Before which incline
The murky troops of Hell
With bristling hair now doth the creature swell

Canst thou reprobate
Read the uncreate
Unspeakable diffused
Throughout the heavenly sphere
Shamefully abused
Transpierced with nail and spear

Behind the stove tamd by my spells
Like an elephant he swells
Wholly now he fills the room
He into mist will melt away
Ascend not to the ceiling Come
Thyself at the masters feet now lay
Thou seest that mine is no idle threat
With holy fire I will scorch thee yet
Wait not the might
That lies in the tripleglowing light
Wait not the might
Of all my arts in fullest measure

MEPHISTOPHELES
As the mist sinks comes forward from behind the stove in the
dress of a travelling scholar

Why all this uproar Whats the masters pleasure

FAUST

This then the kernel of the brute
A travelling scholar Why I needs must smile

MEPHISTOPHELES

Your learned reverence humbly I salute
Youve made me swelter in a pretty style

FAUST

Thy name

MEPHISTOPHELES

The question trifling seems from one
Who it appears the Word doth rate so low
Who undeluded by mere outward show
To Beings depths would penetrate alone

FAUST

With gentlemen like you indeed
The inward essence from the name we read
As all too plainly it doth appear
When Beelzebub Destroyer Liar meets the ear
Who then art thou

MEPHISTOPHELES

Part of that power which still
Produceth good whilst ever scheming ill

FAUST

What hidden mystery in this riddle lies

MEPHISTOPHELES

The spirit I which evermore denies
And justly for whateer to light is brought
Deserves again to be reduced to naught
Then better twere that naught should be
Thus all the elements which ye
Destruction Sin or briefly Evil name
As my peculiar element I claim

FAUST

Thou namst thyself a part and yet a whole I see

MEPHISTOPHELES

The modest truth I speak to thee
Though follys microcosm man it seems
Himself to be a perfect whole esteems
Part of the part am I which at the first was all
A part of darkness which gave birth to light
Proud light who now his mother would enthrall
Contesting space and ancient rank with night
Yet he succeedeth not for struggle as he will
To forms material he adhereth still
From them he streameth them he maketh fair
And still the progress of his beams they check
And so I trust when comes the final wreck
Light will ere long the doom of matter share

FAUST

Thy worthy avocation now I guess
Wholesale annihilation wont prevail
So thourt beginning on a smaller scale

MEPHISTOPHELES

And to say truth as yet with small success
Opposd to naught this clumsy world
The somethingit subsisteth still
Not yet is it to ruin hurld
Despite the efforts of my will
Tempests and earthquakes fire and flood Ive tried
Yet land and ocean still unchangd abide
And then of humankind and beasts brood
Neither oer them can I extend my sway
What countless myriads have I swept away
Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood
the accursed

It is enough to drive me to despair
As in the earth in water and in air
A thousand germs burst forth spontaneously
In moisture drought heat cold they still appear
Had I not flame selected as my sphere
Nothing apart had been reserved for me

FAUST

So thou with thy cold devils fist
Still clenchd in malice impotent
Dost the creative power resist
The active the beneficent
Henceforth some other task essay
Of Chaos thou the wondrous son

MEPHISTOPHELES

We will consider what you say
And talk about it more anon
For this time have I leave to go

FAUST

Why thou shouldst ask I cannot see
Since thee I now have learned to know
At thy good pleasure visit me
Here is the window here the door
The chimney too may serve thy need

MEPHISTOPHELES

I must confess my stepping oer
Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth impede
The wizardfoot doth me retain

FAUST

The pentagram thy peace doth mar
To me thou son of hell explain
How earnest thou in if this thine exit bar
Could such a spirit aught ensnare

MEPHISTOPHELES

Observe it well it is not drawn with care
One of the angles that which points without
Is as thou seest not quite closed

FAUST

Chance hath the matter happily disposd
So thou my captive art No doubt
By accident thou thus art caught

MEPHISTOPHELES

In sprang the dog indeed observing naught
Things now assume another shape
The devils in the house and cant escape

FAUST

Why through the window not withdraw

MEPHISTOPHELES

For ghosts and f or the devil tis a law
Where they stole in there they must forth Were free
The first to choose as to the second slaves are we

FAUST

Een hell hath its peculiar laws I see
Im glad of that a pact may then be made
The which you gentlemen will surely keep

MEPHISTOPHELES

What eer therein is promised thou shalt reap
No tittle shall remain unpaid
But such arrangements time require
Well speak of them when next we meet
Most earnestly I now entreat
This once permission to retire

FAUST

Another moment prithee here remain
Me with some happy word to pleasure

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now let me go ere long Ill come again
Then thou mayst question at thy leisure

FAUST

Twas not toy purpose thee to lime
The snare hast entered of thine own free will
Let him who holds the devil hold him still
So soon hell catch him not a second time

MEPHISTOPHELES

If it so please thee Im at thy command
Only on this condition understand
That worthily thy leisure to beguile
I here may exercise my arts awhile

FAUST

Thourt free to do so Gladly Ill attend
But be thine art a pleasant one

MEPHISTOPHELES
My friend
This hour enjoyment more intense
Shall captivate each ravishd sense
Than thou couldst compass in the bound
Of the whole years unvarying round
And what the dainty spirits sing
The lovely images they bring
Are no fantastic sorcery
Rich odours shall regale your smell
On choicest sweets your palate dwell
Your feelings thrill with ecstasy

No preparation do we need
Here we together are Proceed

SPIRITS

Hence overshadowing gloom
Vanish from sight
Oer us thine azure dome
Bend beauteous light
Dark clouds that oer us spread
Melt in thin air
Stars your soft radiance shed
Tender and fair
Girt with celestial might
Winging their airy flight
Spirits are thronging
Follows their forms of light
Infinite longing
Flutter their vestures bright
Oer field and grove
Where in their leafy bower
Lovers the livelong hour
Vow deathless love
Soft bloometh bud and bower
Bloometh the grove
Grapes from the spreading vine
Crown the full measure
Fountains of foaming wine
Gush from the pressure
Still where the currents wind
Gems brightly gleam
Leaving the hills behind
On rolls the stream
Now into ample seas
Spreadeth the flood
Laying the sunny leas
Mantled with wood
Rapture the featherd throng
Gaily careering
Sip as they float along
Sunward theyre steering
On towards the isles of light
Winging their way
That on the waters bright
Dancingly play
Hark to the choral strain
Joyfully ringing
While on the grassy plain
Dancers are springing
Climbing the steep hills side
Skimming the glassy tide
Wander they there
Others on pinions wide
Wing the blue air
All lifeward tending upward still wending
Towards yonder stars that gleam
Far far above
Stars from whose tender beam
Rains blissful love

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well done my dainty spirits now he slumbers
Ye have entrancd him fairly with your numbers
This minstrelsy of yours I must repay
Thou art not yet the man to hold the devil fast
With fairest shapes your spells around him cast
And plunge him in a sea of dreams
But that this charm be rent the threshold passed
Tooth of rat the way must clear
I need not conjure long it seems
One rustles hitherward and soon my voice will hear
The master of the rats and mice
Of flies and frogs of bugs and lice
Commands thy presence without fear
Come forth and gnaw the threshold here
Where he with oil has smeard itThou
Comst hopping forth already Now
To work The point that holds me bound
Is in the outer angle found
Another bitesonow tis done
Now Faustus till we meet again dream on

FAUST awaking
Am I once more deluded must I deem
That thus the throng of spirits disappear
The devils presence was it but a dream
Hath but a poodle scapd and left me here

STUDY
FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

A knock Come in Who now would break my rest

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis I

FAUST

Come in

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thrice be the words expressd

FAUST

Then I repeat Come in

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis well
I hope that we shall soon agree
For now your fancies to expel
Here as a youth of high degree
I come in goldlacd scarlet vest
And stiffsilk mantle richly dressd
A cocks gay feather for a plume
A long and pointed rapier too
And briefly I would counsel you
To don at once the same costume
And free from trammels speed away
That what life is you may essay

FAUST

In every garb I needs must feel oppressd
My heart to earths low cares a prey
Too old the triflers part to play
Too young to live by no desire possessd
What can the world to me afford
Renounce renounce is still the word
This is the everlasting song
In every ear that ceaseless rings
And which alas our whole life long
Hoarsely each passing moment sings
But to new horror I awake each morn
And I could weep hot tears to see the sun
Dawn on another day whose round forlorn
Accomplishes no wish of minenot one
Which still with froward captiousness impains
Een the presentiment of every joy
While low realities and paltry cares
The spirits fond imaginings destroy
Then must I too when falls the veil of night
Stretchd on my pallet languish in despair
Appalling dreams my soul affright
No rest vouchsafed me even there
The god who throned within my breast resides
Deep in my soul can stir the springs
With sovereign sway my energies he guides
He cannot move external things
And so existence is to me a weight
Death fondly I desire and life I hate

MEPHISTOPHELES

And yet methinks by most twill be confessd
That Death is never quite a welcome guest

FAUST

Happy the man around whose brow he binds
The bloodstaind wreath in conquests dazzling hour
Or whom excited by the dance he finds
Dissolvd in bliss in loves delicious bower
O that before the lofty spirits might
Enraptured I had rendered up my soul

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yet did a certain man refrain one night
Of its brown juice to drain the crystal bowl

FAUST

To play the spy diverts you then

MEPHISTOPHELES

I own
Though not omniscient much to me is known

FAUST

If oer my soul the tone familiar stealing
Drew me from harrowing thoughts bewildring maze
Touching the lingring chords of childlike feeling
With sweet harmonies of happier days
So curse I all around the soul that windeth
Its magic and alluring spell
And with delusive flattery bindeth
Its victim to this dreary cell
Cursd before all things be the high opinion
Wherewith the spirit girds itself around
Of shows delusive cursd be the dominion
Within whose mocking sphere our sense is bound
Accursd of dreams the treacherous wiles
The cheat of glory deathless fame
Accursd what each as property beguiles
Wife child slave plough whateer its name
Accursd be mammon when with treasure
He doth to daring deeds incite
Or when to steep the soul in pleasure
He spreads the couch of soft delight
Cursd be the grapes balsamic juice
Accursd loves dream of joys the first
Accursd be hope accursd be faith
And more than all be patience cursd

CHORUS OP SPIRITS invisible

Woe woe
Thou hast destroyd
The beautiful world
With violent blow
Tis shiverd tis shatterd
The fragments abroad by a demigod scatterd
Now we sweep
The wrecks into nothingness
Fondly we weep
The beauty thats gone
Thou mongst the Sons of earth
Lofty and mighty one
Build it once more
In thine own bosom the lost world restore
Now with unclouded sense
Enter a new career
Songs shall salute thine ear
Neer heard before

MEPHISTOPHELES

My little ones these spirits be
Hark with shrewd intelligence
How they recommend to thee
Action and the joys of sense
In the busy world to dwell
Fain they would allure thee hence
For within this lonely cell
Stagnate sap of life and sense

Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief
Which vulturelike consumes thee in this den
The worst society is some relief
Making thee feel thyself a man with men
Nathless it is not meant I trow
To thrust thee mid the vulgar throng

I to the upper ranks do not belong
Yet if by me companiond thou
Thy steps through life forthwith wilt take
Upon the spot myself Ill make
Thy comrade Should it suit thy need
I am thy servant am thy slave indeed

FAUST

And how must I thy services repay

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thereto thou lengthend respite hast

FAUST

No No
The devil is an egoist I know
And for Heavens sake tis not his way
Kindness to any one to show
Let the condition plainly be exprest
Such a domestic is a dangerous guest

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ill pledge myself to be thy servant here
Still at thy back alert and prompt to be
But when together yonder we appear
Then shalt thou do the same for me

FAUST

But small concern I feel for yonder world
Hast thou this system into ruin hurld
Another may arise the void to fill
This earth the fountain whence my pleasures flow
This sun doth daily shine upon my woe
And if this world I must forego
Let happen thenwhat can and will
I to this theme will close mine ears
If men hereafter hate and love

FAUST

And if there be in yonder spheres
A depth below or height above

MEPHISTOPHELES

In this mood thou mayst venture it But make
The compact I at once will undertake
To charm thee with mine arts Ill give thee more
Than mortal eye hath eer beheld before

FAUST

What sorry Devil hast thou to bestow
Was ever mortal spirit in its high endeavour
Fathomd by Being such as thou
Yet food thou hast which satisfieth never
Hast ruddy gold that still doth flow
Like restless quicksilver away
A game thou hast at which none win who play
A girl who would with amorous eyen
Een from my breast a neighbour snare
Lofty ambitions joy divine
That meteorlike dissolves in air
Show me the fruit that ere tis pluckd doth rot
And trees whose verdure daily buds anew

MEPHISTOPHELES

Such a commission scares me not
I can provide such treasures it is true
But my good friend a season will come round
When on whats good we may regale in peace

FAUST

If eer upon my couch stretched at my ease Im found
Then may my life that instant cease
Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile
Till selfreproach away I cast
Me with joys lure canst thou beguile
Let that day be for me the last
Be this our wager

MEPHISTOPHELES

Settled

FAUST

Sure and fast
When to the moment I shall say
Linger awhile so fair thou art
Then mayst thou fetter me straightway
Then to the abyss will I depart
Then may the solemn deathbell sound
Then from thy service thou art free
The index then may cease its round
And time be never more for me

MEPHISTOPHELES

I shall remember pause ere tis too late

FAUST

Thereto a perfect right hast thou
My strength I do not rashly overrate
Slave am I here at any rate
If thine or whose it matters not I trow

MEPHISTOPHELES

At thine inaugural feast I will this day
Attend my duties to commence
But one thingAccidents may happen hence
A line or two in writing grant I pray

FAUST

A writing Pedant dost demand from me
Man and mans plighted word are these unknown to thee
Ist not enough that by the word I gave
My doom for evermore is cast
Doth not the world in all its currents rave
And must a promise hold me fast
Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart
Who of his own free will therefrom would part
How blest within whose breast truth reigneth pure
No sacrifice will he repent when made
A formal deed with seal and signature
A spectre this from which all shrink afraid
The word its life resigneth in the pen
Leather and wax usurp the mastery then
Spirits of evil what dost thou require
Brass marble parchment paper dost desire
Shall I with chisel pen or graver write
Thy choice is free to me tis all the same

MEPHISTOPHELES

Wherefore thy passion so excite
And thus thine eloquence inflame
A scrap is for our compact good
Thou undersignest merely with a drop of blood

FAUST

If this will satisfy thy mind
Thy whim Ill gratify howeer absurd

MEPHISTOPHELES

Blood is a juice of very special kind

FAUST

Be not afraid that I shall break my word
The scope of all my energy
Is in exact accordance with my vow
Vainly I have aspired too high
Im on a level but with such as thou
Me the great spirit scornd defied
Nature from me herself doth hide
Rent is the web of thought my mind
Doth knowledge loathe of every kind
In depths of sensual pleasure drownd
Let us our fiery passions still
Enwrappd in magics veil profound
Let wondrous charms our senses thrill
Plunge we in times tempestuous flow
Stem we the rolling surge of chance
There may alternate weal and woe
Success and failure as they can
Mingle and shift in changeful dance
Excitement is the sphere for man

MEPHISTOPHELES

Nor goal nor measure is prescribd to you
If you desire to taste of every thing
To snatch at joy while on the wing
May your career amuse and profit too
Only fall to and dont be over coy

FAUST

Hearken The end I aim at is not joy
I crave excitement agonizing bliss
Enamourd hatred quickening vexation
Purgd from the love of knowledge my vocation
The scope of all my powers henceforth be this
To bare my breast to every pangto know
In my hearts core all human weal and woe
To grasp in thought the lofty and the deep
Mens various fortunes on my breast to heap
And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind
And share at length with them the shipwreck of mankind

MEPHISTOPHELES

Oh credit me who still as ages roll
Have chewd this bitter fare from year to year
No mortal from the cradle to the bier
Digests the ancient leaven Know this Whole
Doth for the Deity alone subsist
He in eternal brightness doth exist
Us unto darkness he hath brought and here
Where day and night alternate is your sphere

FAUST

But tis my will

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well spoken I admit
But one thing puzzles me my friend
Times short art long methinks twere fit
That you to friendly counsel should attend
A poet choose as your ally
Let him thoughts wide dominion sweep
Each good and noble quality
Upon your honoured brow to heap
The lions magnanimity
The fleetness of the hind
The fiery blood of Italy
The Northerns stedfast mind
Let him to you the mystery show
To blend high aims and cunning low
And while youths passions are aflame
To fall in love by rule and plan
I fain would meet with such a man
Would him Sir Microcosmus name

FAUST

What then am I if I aspire in vain
The crown of our humanity to gain
Towards which my every sense doth strain

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thourt after alljust what thou art
Put on thy head a wig with countless locks
And to a cubits height upraise thy socks
Still thou remainest ever what thou art

FAUST

I feel it I have heapd upon my brain
The gatherd treasure of mans thought in vain
And when at length from studious toil I rest
No power newborn springs up within my breast
A hairs breadth is not added to my height
I am no nearer to the infinite

MEPHISTOPHELES

Good sir these things you view indeed
Just as by other men theyre viewd
We must more cleverly proceed
Before lifes joys our grasp elude
The devil thou hast hands and feet
And head and heart are also thine
What I enjoy with relish sweet
Is it on that account less mine
If for six stallions I can pay
Do I not own their strength and speed
A proper man I dash away
As their two dozen legs were mine indeed
Up then from idle pondering free
And forth into the world with me
I tell you whatyour speculative churl
Is like a beast which some ill spirit leads
On barren wilderness in ceaseless whirl

While all around lie fair and verdant meads

FAUST

But how shall we begin

MEPHISTOPHELES

We will go hence with speed
A place of torment this indeed
A precious life thyself to bore
And some few youngsters evermore
Leave that to neighbour Paunchwithdraw
Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw
The very best that thou dost know
Thou darst not to the striplings show
One in the passage now doth wait

FAUST

Im in no mood to see him now

MEPHISTOPHELES

Poor lad He must be tired I trow
He must not go disconsolate
Hand me thy cap and gown the mask
Is for my purpose quite first rate
He changes his dress
Now leave it to my wit I ask
But quarter of an hour meanwhile equip
And make all ready for our pleasant trip
Exit FAUST

MEPHISTOPHELES in FAUSTS long gown

Mortal the loftiest attributes of men
Reason and Knowledge only thus contemn
Still let the Prince of lies without control
With shows and mocking charms delude thy soul
I have thee unconditionally then
Fate hath endowd him with an ardent mind
Which unrestraind still presses on for ever
And whose precipitate endeavour
Earths joys oerleaping leaveth them behind
Him will I drag through lifes wild waste
Through scenes of vapid dulness where at last
Bewilderd he shall falter and stick fast
And still to mock his greedy haste
Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond
Vainly hell seek refreshment anguishtost
And were he not the devils by his bond
Yet must his soul infallibly be lost

A STUDENT enters

STUDENT

But recently Ive quitted home
Full of devotion am I come
A man to know and hear whose name
With reverence is known to fame

MEPHISTOPHELES

Your courtesy much flatters me
A man like other men you see
Pray have you yet applied elsewhere

STUDENT

I would entreat your friendly care
Ive youthful blood and courage high
Of gold I bring a fair supply
To let me go my mother was not fain
But here I longed true knowledge to attain

MEPHISTOPHELES

Youve hit upon the very place

STUDENT

And yet my steps I would retrace
These walls this melancholy room
Oerpower me with a sense of gloom
The space is narrow nothing green
No friendly tree is to be seen
And in these halls with benches filled distraught
Sight hearing fail me and the power of thought

MEPHISTOPHELES

It all depends on habit Thus at first
The infant takes not kindly to the breast
But before long its eager thirst
Is fain to slake with hearty zest
Thus at the breasts of wisdom day by day
With keener relish youll your thirst allay

STUDENT

Upon her neck I fain would hang with joy
To reach it say what means must I employ

MEPHISTOPHELES

Explain ere further time we lose
What special faculty you choose

STUDENT

Profoundly learned I would grow
What heaven contains would comprehend
Oer earths wide realm my gaze extend
Nature and science I desire to know

MEPHISTOPHELES

You are upon the proper track I find
Take heed let nothing dissipate your mind

STUDENT

My heart and soul are in the chase
Though to be sure I fain would seize
On pleasant summer holidays
A little liberty and careless ease

MEPHISTOPHELES

Use well your time so rapidly it flies
Method will teach you time to win
Hence my young friend I would advise
With college logic to begin
Then will your mind be so well braced
In Spanish boots so tightly laced
That on twill circumspectly creep
Thoughts beaten track securely keep
Nor will it ignisfatuus like
Into the path of error strike
Then many a day theyll teach you how
The minds spontaneous acts till now
As eating and as drinking free
Require a processone two three
In truth the subtle web of thought
Is like the weavers fabric wrought
One treadle moves a thousand lines
Swift dart the shuttles to and fro
Unseen the threads together flow
A thousand knots one stroke combines
Then forward steps your sage to show
And prove to you it must be so
The first being so and so the second
The third and fourth deducd we see
And if there were no first and second
Nor third nor fourth would ever be
This scholars of all countries prize
Yet mong themselves no weavers rise
He who would know and treat of aught alive
Seeks first the living spirit thence to drive
Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand
There only fails alas the spiritband
This process chemists name in learned thesis
Mocking themselves Naturer encheiresis

STUDENT

Your words I cannot fully comprehend

MEPHISTOPHELES

In a short time you will improve my friend
When of scholastic forms you learn the use
And how by method all things to reduce

STUDENT

So doth all this my brain confound
As if a millwheel there were turning round

MEPHISTOPHELES

And next before aught else you learn
You must with zeal to metaphysics turn
There see that you profoundly comprehend
What doth the limit of mans brain transcend
For that which is or is not in the head
A sounding phrase will serve you in good stead
But before all strive this half year
From one fixd order neer to swerve

Five lectures daily you must hear
The hour still punctually observe
Yourself with studious zeal prepare
And closely in your manual look
Hereby may you be quite aware
That all he utters standeth in the book
Yet write away without cessation
As at the Holy Ghosts dictation

STUDENT

This Sir a second time you need not say
Your counsel I appreciate quite
What we possess in black and white
We can in peace and comfort bear away

MEPHISTOPHELES

A faculty I pray you name

STUDENT

For jurisprudence Some distaste I own

MEPHISTOPHELES

To me this branch of science is well known
And hence I cannot your repugnance blame
Customs and laws in every place
Like a disease an heirloom dread
Still trail their curse from race to race
And furtively abroad they spread
To nonsense reasons self they turn
Beneficence becomes a pest
Woe unto thee that thourt a grandson born
As for the law born with us unexpressed
That law alas none careth to discern

STUDENT

You deepen my dislike The youth
Whom you instruct is blest in sooth
To try theology I feel inclined

MEPHISTOPHELES

I would not lead you willingly astray
But as regards this science you will find
So hard it is to shun the erring way
And so much hidden poison lies therein
Which scarce can you discern from medicine
Here too it is the best to listen but to one
And by the masters words to swear alone
To sum up allTo words hold fast
Then the safe gate securely passd
Youll reach the lane of certainty at last

STUDENT

But then some meaning must the words convey

MEPHISTOPHELES

Right But oeranxious thought youll find of no avail
For there precisely where ideas fail
A word comes opportunely into play
Most admirable weapons words are found
On words a system we securely ground
In words we can conveniently believe
Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave

STUDENT

Your pardon for my importunity
Yet once more must I trouble you
On medicine Ill thank you to supply
A pregnant utterance or two
Three years how brief the appointed tide
The field heaven knows is all too wide
If but a friendly hint be thrown
Tis easier then to feel ones way

MEPHISTOPHELES aside

Im weary of the dry pedantic tone
And must again the genuine devil play

Aloud
Of medicine the spirits caught with ease
The great and little world you study through
That things may then their course pursue
As heaven may please
In vain abroad you range through science ample space
Each man learns only that which learn he can
Who knows the moment to embrace
He is your proper man
In person you are tolerably made
Nor in assurance will you be deficient
Selfconfidence acquire be not afraid
Others will then esteem you a proficient
Learn chiefly with the sex to deal
Their thousands ahs and ohs
These the sage doctor knows
He only from one point can heal
Assume a decent tone of courteous ease
You have them then to humour as you please
First a diploma must belief infuse
That you in your profession take the lead
You then at once those easy freedoms use
For which another many a year must plead
Learn how to feel with nice address
The dainty wristand how to press
With ardent furtive glance the slender waist
To feel how tightly it is laced

STUDENT

There is some sense in that one sees the how and why

MEPHISTOPHELES

Grey is young friend all theory
And green of life the golden tree

STUDENT

I swear it seemeth like a dream to me
May I some future time repeat my visit
To hear on what your wisdom grounds your views

MEPHISTOPHELES

Command my humble service when you choose

STUDENT

Ere I retire one boon I must solicit
Here is my album do not Sir deny
This token of your favour

MEPHISTOPHELES

Willingly
He writes and returns the book

STUDENT reads

ERITIS SICUT DEUS SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM
He reverently closes the book and retires

MEPHISTOPHELES

Let but this ancient proverb be your rule
My cousin follow still the wily snake
And with your likeness to the gods poor fool
Ere long be sure your poor sick heart will quake

FAUST enters
Whither away

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis thine our course to steer
The little world and then the great well view
With what delight what profit too
Thoult revel through thy gay career

FAUST
Despite my length of beard I need
The easy manners that insure success
Th attempt I fear can neer succeed
To mingle in the world I want address
I still have an embarrassd air and then
I feel myself so small with other men

MEPHISTOPHELES
Time my good friend will all thats needful give
Be only selfpossessed and thou hast learnd to live

FAUST

But how are we to start I pray
Steeds servants carriage where are they

MEPHISTOPHELES

Weve but to spread this mantle wide
Twill serve whereon through air to ride
No heavy baggage need you take
When we our bold excursion make
A little gas which I will soon prepare
Lifts us from earth aloft through air
Light laden we shall swiftly steer
I wish you joy of your new lifecareer

AUERBACHS CELLAR IN LEIPZIG
A Drinking Party

FROSCH

No drinking Naught a laugh to raise
None of your gloomy looks I pray
You who so bright were wont to blaze
Are dull as wetted straw today

BRANDER

Tis all your fault your part you do not bear
No beastliness no folly

FROSCH
pours a glass of wine over his head

There
You have them both

BRANDER

You double beast

FROSCH

Tis what you askd me for at least

SIEBEL

Whoever quarrels turn him out
With open throat drink roar and shout
Hollo Hollo Ho

ALTMAYER

Zounds fellow cease your deafning cheers
Bring cottonwool He splits my ears

SIEBEL

Tis when the roof rings back the tone
Then first the full power of the bass is known

FROSCH

Right out with him who takes offence
A tara lara da

ALTMAYER

A tara lara da

FROSCH

Our throats are tuned Come lets commence

Sings
The holy Roman empire now
How holds it still together

BRANDER

An ugly song a song political
A song offensive Thank God every morn
To rule the Roman empire that you were not born
I bless my stars at least that mine is not
Either a kaisers or a chancellors lot
Yet mong ourselves should one still lord it oer the rest
That we elect a pope I now suggest
Ye know what quality ensures
A mans success his rise secures

Faoscn sings
Bear lady nightingale above
Ten thousand greetings to my love

SIESEL

No greetings to a sweetheart
No lovesongs shall there be

FROSCH

Lovegreetings and lovekisses Thou shalt not hinder me

Sings
Undo the bolt in silly night
Undo the bolt the lover wakes
Shut to the bolt when morning breaks

SIEBEL

Ay sing sing on praise her with all thy might
My turn to laugh will come some day
Me hath she jilted once you the same trick shell play
Some gnome her lover be where crossroads meet
With her to play the fool or old hegoat
From Blocksberg coming in swift gallop bleat
A good night to her from his hairy throat
A proper lad of genuine flesh and blood
Is for the damsel far too good
The greeting she shall have from me
To smash her windowpanes will be

BRANDER striking on the table

Silence Attend to me give ear
Confess sirs I know how to live
Some lovesick folk are sitting here
Hence tis but fit their hearts to cheer
That I a goodnight strain to them should give
Hark of the newest fashion is my song
Strike boldly in the chorus clear and strong

He sings
Once in a cellar lived a rat
He feasted there on butter
Until his paunch became as fat
As that of Doctor Luther
The cook laid poison for the guest
Then was his heart with pangs oppressd
As if his frame love wasted

Chorus shouting
As if his frame love wasted

BRANDER

He ran around he ran abroad
Of every puddle drinking
The house with rage he scratchd and gnawd
In vainhe fast was Sinking
Full many an anguishd bound he gave
Nothing the hapless brute could save
As if his frame love wasted

CHORUS

As if his frame love wasted

BRANDER

By torture driven in open day
The kitchen he invaded
Convulsed upon the hearth he lay
With anguish sorely jaded
The poisoner laughd Ha ha quoth she
His life is ebbing fast I see
As if his frame love wasted

CHORUS

As if his frame love wasted

SIEBEL

How the dull boors exulting shout
Poison for the poor rats to strew
A fine exploit it is no doubt

BRANDER

They as it seems stand well with you

ALTMAYER

Old baldpate with the paunch profound
The rats mishap hath tamed his nature
For he his counterpart bath found
Depicted in the swollen creature

FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES

I now must introduce to you
Before aught else this jovial crew
To show how lightly life may glide away
With the folk here each days a holiday
With little wit and much content

Each on his own small round intent
Like sportive kitten with its tail
While no sickheadache they bewail
And while their host will credit give
Joyous and free from care they live

BRANDER

Theyre off a journey that is clear
From their strange manners they have scarce been here
An hour

FROSCH

Youre right Leipzigs the place for me
Tis quite a little Paris people there
Acquire a certain easy finishd air

SIEBEL

What take you now these travellers to be

FROSCH

Let me alone Oer a full glass youll see
As easily Ill worm their secret out
As draw an infants tooth Ive not a doubt
That my two gentlemen are nobly born
They look dissatisfied and full of scorn

BRANDER

They are but mountebanks Ill lay a bet

ALTMAYER

Most like

FROSCH

Mark me Ill screw it from them yet

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

These fellows would not scent the devil out
Een though he had them by the very throat

FAUST

SIEBEL

Thanks for your fair salute
Aside glancing at MEPHISTOPHELES
How goes the fellow on a halting foot

MEPHISTOPHELES

Is it permitted here with you to sit
Then though good wine is not forthcoming here
Good company at least our hearts will cheer

ALTMAYER

A dainty gentleman no doubt of it

FROSCH

Youre doubtless recently from Rippach Pray
Did you with Master Hans there chance to sup

MEPHISTOPHELES

Today we passd him but we did not stop
When last we met him he had much to say
Touching his cousins and to each he sent
Full many a greeting and kind compliment
With an inclination towards FROSCH

ALTMAYER aside to FROSCH

You have it there

SIEBEL

Faith hes a knowing one

FROSCH

Have patience I will show him up anon

MEPHISTOPHELES

We heard erewhile unless Im wrong
Voices well trained in chorus pealing
Certes most choicely here must song
Reecho from this vaulted ceiling

FROSCH

That youre an amateur one plainly sees

MEPHISTOPHELES

Oh no though strong the love I cannot boast much skill

ALTMAYER

Give us a song

MEPHISTOPHELES

As many as you will

SIEBEL

But be it a brand new one if you please

MEPHISTOPHELES

But recently returned from Spain are we
The pleasant land of wine and minstrelsy

Sings
A king there was once reigning
Who had a goodly flea

FROSCH

Hark did you rightly catch the words a flea
An odd sort of a guest he needs must be

MEPHISTOPHELES sings

A king there was once reigning
Who had a goodly flea
Him loved he without feigning
As his own son were he
His tailor then he summond
The tailor to him goes
Now measure me the youngster
For jerkin and for hose

BRANDER

Take proper heed the tailor strictly charge
The nicest measurement to take
And as he loves his head to make
The hose quite smooth and not too large

MEPHISTOPHELES

In satin and in velvet
Behold the yonker dressed
Bedizend oer with ribbons
A cross upon his breast
Prime minister they made him
He wore a star of state
And all his poor relations
Were courtiers rich and great

The gentlemen and ladies
At court were sore distressed
The queen and all her maidens
Were bitten by the pest
And yet they dared not scratch them
Or chase the fleas away
If we are bit we catch them
And crack without delay

CHORUS shouting

If we are bit c

FROSCH

Bravo Thats the song for me

SIEBEL

Such be the fate of every flea

BRANDER

With Clever finger catch and Kill

ALTMAYER

Hurrah for wine and freedom still

MEPHISTOPHELES

Were but your wine a trifle better friend
A glass to freedom I would gladly drain

SIEBEL

Youd better not repeat those words again t

MEPHISTOPHELES

I am afraid the landlord to offend
Else freely I would treat each worthy guest
From our own cellar to the very best

SIEBEL

Out with it then Your doings Ill defend

FROSCH

Give a good glass and straight well praise you one and all
Only let not your samples be too small
For if my judgment you desire
Certes an ample mouthful I require

ALTMAYER aside

I guess theyre from the Rhenish land

MEPHISTOPHELES

Fetch me a gimlet here

BRANDER

Say what therewith to bore
You cannot have the winecasks at the door

ALTMAYER

Our landlords toolbasket behind doth yonder stand

MEPHISTOPHELES takes the gimlet

To FROSCH

Now only say what liquor will you take

FROSCH

How mean you that have you of every sort

MEPHISTOPHELES

Each may his own selection make

ALTMAYER to FROSCH

Ha Ha You lick your lips already at the thought

FROSCH

Good if I have my choice the Rhenish I propose
For still the fairest gifts the fatherland bestows

MEPHISTOPHELES

boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite to where FROSCH
is sitting

Give me a little waxand make some stoppersquick

ALTMAYER

Why this is nothing but a jugglers trick

MEPHISTOPHELES to BRANDER

And you

BRANDER

Champagnes the wine for me
Right brisk and sparkling let it be

MEPHISTOPHELES bores one of the party has in the meantime
prepared the waxstoppers and stopped the holes

BRANDER

What foreign is one always cant decline
Whats good is often scatterd far apart
The French your genuine German hates with all his heart
Yet has a relish for their wine

SIEBEL

as MEPHISTOPHELES approaches him

I like not acid wine I must allow
Give me a glass of genuine sweet

MEPHISTOPHELES bored

Tokay
Shall if you wish it flow without delay

ALTMAYER

Come look me in the face no fooling now
You are but making fun of us I trow

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ah ah that would indeed be making free
With such distinguished guests Come no delay
What liquor can I serve you with I pray

ALTMAYER

Only be quick it matters not to me
After the holes are bored and stopped

MEPHISTOPHELES with strange gestures

Grapes the vinestock bears
Horns the buckgoat wears
Wine is sap the vine is wood
The wooden board yields wine as good
With a deeper glance and true
The mysteries of nature view
Have faith and heres a miracle
Your stoppers draw and drink your fill

ALL

as they draw the stoppers and the wine chosen by each runs into
his glass
Oh beauteous spring which flows so far

MEPHISTOPHELES
Spill not a single drop of this beware They drink repeatedly

ALL sing

Happy as cannibals are we
Or as five hundred swine

MEPHISTOPHELES

Theyre in their glory mark their elevation

FAUST

Lets hence nor here our stay prolong

MEPHISTOPHELES

Attend of brutishness ere long
Youll see a glorious revelation

SIEBEL

drinks carelessly the wine is spilt upon the ground and turns to
flame
Help fire help Hell is burning

MEPHISTOPHELES

addressing the flames

Stop
Kind element be still I say

To the Company

SIEBEL

What means the knave For this youll dearly pay
Us it appears you do not know

FROSCH

Such tricks a second time hed better show

ALTMAYER

Methinks twere well we packd him quietly away

SIEBEL

What sir with us your hocuspocus play

MEPHISTOPHELES

Silence old winecask

SIEBEL

How add insult too
Vile broomstick

BRANDER

Hold or blows shall rain on you

ALTMAYER

draws a stopper out of the table fire springs out against him
I burn I burn

SIEBEL

Tis sorcery I vow
Strike home The fellow is fair game I trow
They draw their knives and attack MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES with solemn gestures

Visionary scenes appear
Words delusive cheat the ear Be ye there and be ye here
They stand amazed and gaze at each other

ALTMAYER

Where am I What a beauteous land

FROSCH

Vineyards unless my sight deceives

SIEBEL

And clustring grapes too close at hand

BRANDER

And underneath the spreading leaves
What stems there be What grapes I see
He senses SIEBEL by the nose
The others reciprocally do the same and raise their knives

MEPHISTOPHELES as above

Delusion from their eyes the bandage take
Note how the devil loves a jest to break
He disappears with FAUST the fellows draw back from one
another

SIEBEL

What was it

ALTMAYER

How

FROSCH

Was that your nose

BRANDER to SIEBEL

And look my hand doth thine enclose

ALTMAYER

I felt a shock it went through every limb
A chair Im fainting All things swim

FROSCH

Say what has happened whats it all about

SIEBEL

Where is the fellow Could I scent him out
His body from his soul Id soon divide

ALTMAYER

With my own eyes upon a cask astride
Forth through the cellardoor I saw him ride
Heavy as lead my feet are growing
Turning to the table
I wonder is the wine still flowing

SIEBEL

Twas all delusion cheat and lie

FROSCH

Twas wine I drank most certainly

BRANDER

But with the grapes how was it pray

ALTMAYER

That none may miracles believe who now will say

WITCHES KITCHEN

A large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth various figures
appear in the vapour rising from it A FEMALE MONKEY sits
beside the caldron to skim it and watch that it does not boil over
The MALE MONKEY with the young ones is seated near
warming himself The walls and ceiling are adorned with the
strangest articles of witchfurniture

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

This senseless juggling witchcraft I detest
Dost promise that in this foul nest
Of madness I shall be restored
Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame
And can she by these rites abhorred
Take thirty winters from my frame
Woes me if thou naught better canst suggest
Hope has already fled my breast
Has neither nature nor a noble mind
A balsam yet devisd of any kind

MEPHISTOPHELES

My friend you now speak sensibly In truth
Nature a method giveth to renew thy youth
But in another book the lessons writ
It forms a curious chapter I admit

FAUST

I fain would know it

MEPHISTOPHELES

Good A remedy
Without physician gold or sorcery
Away forthwith and to the fields repair
Begin to delve to cultivate the ground
Thy senses and thyself confine
Within the very narrowest round
Support thyself upon the simplest fare
Live like a very brute the brutes among
Neither esteem it robbery
The acre thou dost reap thyself to dung
This is the best method credit me
Again at eighty to grow hale and young

FAUST

I am not used to it nor can myself degrade
So far as in my hand to take the spade
This narrow life would suit me not at all

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then we the witch must summon after all

FAUST

Will none but this old beldame do
Canst not thyself the potion brew

MEPHISTOPHELES

A pretty play our leisure to beguile
A thousand bridges I could build meanwhile
Not science only and consummate art
Patience must also bear her part
A quiet spirit worketh whole years long
Time only makes the subtle ferment strong
And all things that belong thereto
Are wondrous and exceeding rare
The devil taught her it is true
But yet the draught the devil cant prepare
Perceiving the beasts
Look yonder what a dainty pair
Here is the maid the knave is there
To the beasts
It seems your dame is not at home

THE MONKEYS

Gone to carouse
Out of the house
Thro the chimney and away

MEPHISTOPHELES

How long is it her wont to roam

THE MONKEYS

While we can warm our paws shell stay

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

What think you of the charming creature

FAUST

I loathe alike their form and features

MEPHISTOPHELES

Nay such discourse be it confessed
Is just the thing that pleases me the best

To the MONKEYS

Tell me ye whelps accursed crew
What Stir ye in the broth about

MONKEYS

Coarse beggars gruel here we stew

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of customers youll have a rout

THE HEMONKEY
approaching and fawning on MEPHISTOPHELES

Quick quick throw the dice
Make me rich in a trice
Oh give me the prize
Alas for myself
Had I plenty of pelf
I then should be wise

MEPHISTOPHELES

How blest the ape would think himself if he
Could only put into the lottery

In the meantime the young MONKEYS have been playing with a
large globe which they roll forwards

THE HEMONKEY
The world behold
Unceasingly rolld
It riseth and falleth ever
It ringeth like glass
How brittle alas
Tis hollow and resteth never
How bright the sphere
Still brighter here
Now living am I
Dear son beware
Nor venture there
Thou too must die
It is of clay
Twill crumble away
There fragments lie

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of what use is the sieve

THE HEMONKEY taking it dozen

The sieve would show
If thou wert a thief or no
He runs to the SHEMONKEY and makes her look through it
Look through the sieve
Dost know him the thief
And darst thou not call him so

MEPHISTOPHELES approaching the fire

And then this pot

THE MONKEYS

The halfwitted sot
He knows not the pot
He knows not the kettle

MEPHISTOPHELES

Unmannerly beast
Be civil at least

THE HEMONKEY

Take the whisk and sit down in the settle
He makes MEPHISTOPHELES sit down

FAUST

who all this time has been standing before a lookingglass
now approaching and now retiring from it

What do I see what form whose charms transcend
The loveliness of earth is mirrord here
O Love to waft me to her sphere
To me the swiftest of thy pinions lend
Alas If I remain not rooted to this place
If to approach more near Im fondly lurd
Her image fades in veiling mist obscurd
Model of beauty both in form and face
Ist possible Hath woman charms so rare
In this recumbent form supremely fair
The essence must I see of heavenly grace
Can aught so exquisite on earth be found

MEPHISTOPHELES

The six days labour of a god my friend
Who doth himself cry bravo at the end
By something clever doubtless should be crownd
For this time gaze your fill and when you please
Just such a prize for you I can provide
How blest is he to whom kind fate decrees
To take her to his home a lovely bride

FAUST continues to gaze into the mirror MEPHISTOPHELES
stretching himself on the settle and playing with the whisk
continues to speak

Here sit I like a king upon his throne
My sceptre thisthe crown I want alone

THE MONKEYS

who have hitherto been making all sorts of strange gestures bring
MEPHISTOPHELES a crown with loud cries

Oh be so good
With Sweat and with blood
The crown to lime

They handle the crown awkwardly and break it in two
pieces with which they skip about

Twas fates decree
We speak and see
We hear and rhyme

FAUST before the mirror

Woes me wellnigh distraught I feel

MEPHISTOPHELES
pointing to the beasts

And even my own head almost begins to reel

THE MONKEYS

If good luck attend
If fitly things blend
Our jargon with thought
And with reason is fraught

FAUST as above

A flame is kindled in my breast
Let us begone nor linger here

MEPHISTOPTIELES
in the same position

It now at least must be confessed
That poets sometimes are sincere

The caldron begins to boil over a great flame arises
which streams up the chimney The WITCH comes down the
chimney with horrible cries

THE WITCH

Ough ough ough ough
Accursed brute accursed SOW
The caldron dost neglect for shame
Accursed brute to scorch the dame

Perceiving FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES

Whom have we here
Whos sneaking here
Whence are ye come
With what desire
The plague of fire
Your bones consume

She dips the skimmingladle into the caldron and
throws flames at FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES and
the MONKEYS The MONKEYS whimper

MEPHISTOPHELES
twirling the whisk which he holds in his hand and striking among
the glasses and pots

Dash Smash
There lies the glass
There lies the slime
Tis but a jest
I but keep time
Thou hellish pest
To thine own chime

While the WITCH steps back in rage aind astonishment

Dost know me Skeleton Vile scarecrow thou
Thy lord and master dost thou know
What holds me that I deal not now
Thee and thine apes a stunning blow
No more respect to my red vest dost pay
Does my cocks feather no allegiance claim
Have I my visage masked today
Must I be forced myself to name

THE WITCH

Master forgive this rude salute
But I perceive no cloven foot
And your two ravens where are they

MEPHISTOPHELES

This once I must admit your plea
For truly I must own that we
Each other have not seen for many a day
The culture too that shapes the world at last
Hath een the devil in its sphere embraced
The northern phantom from the scene hath passd
Tail talons horns are nowhere to be traced
As for the foot with which I cant dispense
Twould injure me in company and hence
Like many a youthful cavalier
False calves I now have worn for many a year

THE WITCH dancing

I am beside myself with joy
To see once more the gallant Satan here

MEPHISTOPHELES

Woman no more that name employ

THE WITCH

But why what mischief hath it done

MEPHISTOPHELES

To fablebooks it now doth appertain
But people from the change have nothing won
Rid of the evil one the evil ones remain
Lord Baron call thou me so is the matter good
Of other cavaliers the mien I wear
Dost make no question of my gentle blood
See here this is the scutcheon that I bear
He makes an unseemly gesture

THE WITCH
laughing immoderately

Ha Ha Just like yourself You are I ween
The same mad wag that you have ever been

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

My friend learn this to understand I pray
To deal with witches this is still the way

THE WITCH

Now tell me gentlemen what you desire

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of your known juice a goblet we require
But for the very oldest let me ask
Double its strength with years doth grow

THE WITCH

Most willingly And here I have a flask
From which Ive sippd myself ere now
Whats more it doth no longer stink
To you a glass I joyfully will give
Aside

If unprepard however this man drink
He hath not as you know an hour to live

MEPHISTOPHELES

Hes my good friend with whom twill prosper well
I grudge him not the choicest of thy store
Now draw thy circle speak thy spell
And straight a bumper for him pour

The WITCH with extraordinary gestures describes a circle and
places strange things within it The glasses meanwhile begin to
ring the caldron to sound and to make music Lastly she brings a
great book places the MONKEYS in the circle to serve her as a
desk and to hold the torches She beckons FAUST to approach

FAUST to MEPHISTOPHELES

Tell me to what doth all this tend
Where will these frantic gestures end
This loathsome cheat this senseless stuff
Ive known and hated long enough

MEPHISTOPHELES

Mere mummery a laugh to raise
Pray dont be so fastidious She
But as a leech her hocuspocus plays
That well with you her potion may agree
He compels FAUST to enter the circle

The WITCH with great emphasis begins to declaim the book

This must thou ken
Of one make ten
Pass two and then
Make square the three
So rich thoult be
Drop out the four
From five and six
Thus says the witch
Make seven and eight
So all is straight
And nine is one
And ten is none
This is the witchs onetimeone

FAUST

The hag doth as in fever rave

MEPHISTOPHELES

To these will follow many a stave
I know it well so rings the book throughout
Much time Ive lost in puzzling oer its pages
For downright paradox no doubt
A mystery remains alike to fools and sages
Ancient the art and modern too my friend
Tis still the fashion as it used to be
Error instead of truth abroad to send
By means of three and one and one and three
Tis ever taught and babbled in the schools
Whod take the trouble to dispute with fools
When words men hear in sooth they usually believe
That there must needs therein be something to conceive

THE WITCH continues
The lofty power
Of wisdoms dower
From all the world conceald
Who thinketh not
To him I wot
Unsought it is reveald

FAUST

What nonsense doth the hag propound
My brain it doth wellnigh confound
A hundred thousand fools or more
Methinks I hear in chorus roar

MEPHISTOPHELES

Incomparable Sibyl cease I pray
Hand us thy liquor without more delay
And to the very brim the goblet crown
My friend he is and need not be afraid
Besides he is a man of many a grade
Who bath drunk deep already

The WITCH with many ceremonies pours the liquor into a cup
as FAUST lifts it to his mouth a light flame arises

MEPHISTOPHELES

Gulp it down
No hesitation It will prove
A cordial and your heart inspire
What with the devil hand and glove
And yet shrink back afraid of fire

The WITCH dissolves the circle FAUST steps Out

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now forth at once thou darst not rest

WITCH

And much sir may the liquor profit you

MEPHISTOPHELES to the WITCH

And if to pleasure thee I aught can do
Pray on Walpurgis mention thy request

WITCH

Here is a song sung oer sometimes youll see
That twill a singular effect produce

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

Come quick and let thyself be led by me
Thou must perspire in order that the juice
Thy frame may penetrate through every part
Then noble idleness I thee will teach to prize
And soon with ecstasy thoult recognise
How Cupid stirs and gambols in thy heart

FAUST

Let me but gaze one moment in the glass
Too lovely was that female form

MEPHISTOPHELES

Nay nay

A model which all women shall surpass
In flesh and blood ere long thou shalt survey
As works the draught thou presently shalt greet
A Helen in each woman thou dost meet

A STREET

FAUST MARGARET passing by

FAUST

Fair lady may I thus make free
To offer you my arm and company

MARGARET

I am no lady am not fair
Can without escort home repair
She disengages herself and exit

FAUST

By heaven This girl is fair indeed
No form like hers can I recall
Virtue she hath and modest heed
Is piquant too and sharp withal
Her cheeks soft light her rosy lips
No length of time will eer eclipse
Her downward glance in passing by
Deep in my heart is stampd for aye
How curt and sharp her answer too
To ecstasy the feeling grew

MEPHISTOPHZLES enters

FAUST

This girl must win for me Dost hear

MEPHISTOPHELES

Which

FAUST

She who but now passed

MEPHISTOPHELES

She from confession coineth here
From every sin absolved and free
I crept near the confessors chair
All innocence her virgin soul
For next to nothing went she there
Oer such as she Ive no control

FAUST

Shes past fourteen

MEPHISTOPHELES

You really talk
Like any gay Lothario
Who every floweret from its stalk
Would pluck and deems nor grace nor truth
Secure against his arts forsooth
This neer the less wont always do

FAUST

Sir Moralizer prithee pause
Nor plague me with your tiresome laws
To cut the matter short my friend
She must this very night be mine
And if to help me you decline
Midnight shall see our compact end

MEPHISTOPHELES

What may occur just bear in mind
A fortnights space at least I need
A fit occasion but to find

FAUST

With but Seven hours I could succeed
Nor should I want the devils wile
So young a creature to beguile

MEPHISTOPHELES

Like any Frenchman now you speak
But do not fret I pray why seek
To hurry to enjoyment straight
The pleasure is not half so great
As when at first around above
With all the fooleries of love
The puppet you can knead and mould
As in Italian story oft is told

FAUST

No such incentives do I need

MEPHISTOPHELES

But now without offence or jest
You cannot quickly I protest
In winning this sweet child succeed
By storm we cannot take the fort
To stratagem we must resort

FAUST

Conduct me to her place of rest
Some token of the angel bring
A kerchief from her snowy breast
A garter bring meany thing

MEPHISTOPHELES

That I my anxious zeal may prove
Your pangs to sooth and aid your love
A single moment will we not delay
Will lead you to her room this very day

FAUST

And shall I see her Have her

MEPHISTOPHELES

No
She to a neighbours house will go
But in her atmosphere alone
The tedious hours meanwhile you may employ
In blissful dreams of future joy

FAUST

Can we go now

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis yet too soon

FAUST

Some present for my love procure
Exit

MEPHISTOPHELES

Presents so soon tis well success is sure
Full many a goodly place I know
And treasures buried long ago
I must a bit oerlook them now
Exit

EVENING A SMALL AND NEAT ROOM

MARGARET
braiding and binding up her hair

I would give something now to know
Who yonder gentleman could be
He had a gallant air I trow
And doubtless was of high degree
That written on his brow was seen
Nor else would lie so bold have been
Exit

MEPHISTOPHELES

Come in tread softly be discreet

FAUST after a pause

Begone and leave me I entreat

MEPHISTOPHELES looking round

Not every maiden is so neat

FAUST gazing round

Welcome sweet twilight calm and blest
That in this hallowd precinct reigns
Fond yearning love inspire my breast
Feeding on hopes sweet dew thy blissful pains
What stillness here environs me
Content and order brood around
What fulness in this poverty
In this small cell what bliss profound
He throws himself on the leather armchair beside
the bed

Receive me thou who hast in thine embrace
Welcomd in joy and grief the ages flown
How oft the children of a bygone race
Have clusterd round this patriarchal throne
Haply she also whom I hold so dear
For Christmas gift with grateful joy possessd
Hath with the full round cheek of childhood here
Her grandsires witherd hand devoutly pressd
Maiden I feel thy spirit haunt the place
Breathing of order and abounding grace
As with a mothers voice it prompteth thee
The pure white cover oer the board to spread
To strew the crisping sand beneath thy tread
Dear hand so godlike in its ministry
The hut becomes a paradise through thee
And here
He raises the bedcurtain
How thrills my pulse with strange delight
Here could I linger hours untold
Thou Nature didst in vision bright
The embryo angel here unfold
Here lay the child her bosom warm
With life while steeped in slumbers dew
To perfect grace her godlike form
With pure and hallowd weavings grew

And thou ah here what seekest thou
How quails mine inmost being now
What wouldst thou here what makes thy heart so sore
Unhappy Faust I know thee now no more

Do I a magic atmosphere inhale
Erewhile my passion would not brook delay
Now in a pure lovedream I melt away
Are we the sport of every passing gale

Should she return and enter now
How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame
Proud vaunterthou wouldst hide thy brow
And at her feet sink down with shame

MEPHISTOPHELES

Quick quick below I see her there

FAUST

Away I will return no more

MEPHISTOPHELES

Here is a casket with a store
Of jewels which I got elsewhere
Just lay it in the press make haste
I swear to you twill turn her brain
Therein some trifles I have placed
Wherewith another to obtain
But child is child and play is play

FAUST

I know notshall I

MEPHISTOPHELES

Do you ask
Perchance you would retain the treasure
If such your wish why then I say
Henceforth absolve me from my task
Nor longer waste your hours of leisure
I trust youre not by avarice led
I rub my hands I scratch my head
He places the casket in the press and closes the lock
Now quick Away
That soon the sweet young creature may
The wish and purpose of your heart obey
Yet stand you there
As would you to the lectureroom repair
As if before you stood
Arrayed in flesh and blood
Physics and metaphysics weird and grey
Away Exeunt

MARGARET with a lamp
Here tis so close so sultry now
She opens the window
Yet out of doors tis not so warm
I feel so strange I know not how
I wish my mother would come home
Through me there runs a shuddering
Im but a foolish timid thing
While undressing herself she begins to sing

There was a king in Thule
True even to the grave
To whom his dying mistress
A golden beaker gave

At every feast he drained it
Naught was to him so dear
And often as he drained it
Gushd from his eyes the tear

When death came unrepining
His cities oer he told
All to his heir resigning
Except his cup of gold

With many a knightly vassal
At a royal feast sat he
In yon proud ball ancestral
In his castle oer the sea

Up stood the jovial monarch
And quaffd his last lifes glow
Then hurled the hallowd goblet
Into the flood below

He saw it splashing drinking
And plunging hi the sea
His eyes meanwhile were sinking
And never again drank he
She opens the press to put away her clothes and perceives the
casket

How comes this lovely casket here The press
I locked of that Im confident
Tis very wonderful Whats in it I cant guess
Perhaps twas brought by some one in distress
And left in pledge for loan my mother lent
Here by a ribbon hangs a little key
I have a mind to open it and see
Heavens only look what have we here
In all my days neer saw I such a sight
Jewels which any noble dame might wear
For some high pageant richly dight
This chainhow would it look on me
These splendid gems whose may they be
She puts them on and steps before the glass

Were but the earrings only mine
Thus one has quite another air
What hoots it to be young and fair
It doubtless may be very flue
But then alas none cares for you
And praise sounds half like pity too
Gold all doth lure
Gold doth secure
All things Alas we poor

PROMENADE

FAUST walking thoughtfully up and down To him
MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES

By all rejected love By hellish fire I curse
Would I knew aught to make my imprecation worse

FAUST

What aileth thee what chafes thee now so sore
A face like that I never saw before

MEPHISTOPHELES

Id yield me to the devil instantly
Did it not happen that myself am he

FAUST

There must be some disorder in thy wit
To rave thus like a madman is it fit

MEPHISTOPHELES

Think only think The gems for Gretchen brought
Them hath a priest now made his own
A glimpse of them the mother caught
And gan with secret fear to groan
The womans scent is keen enough
Doth ever in the prayerbook snuff
Smells every article to ascertain
Whether the thing is holy or profane
And scented in the jewels rare
That there was not much blessing there
My child she cries illgotten good
Ensnares the soul consumes the blood
With them well deck our Ladys shrine
Shell cheer our souls with bread divine
At this poor Gretchen gan to pout
Tis a gifthorse at least she thought
And sure he godless cannot be
Who brought them here so cleverly
Straight for a priest the mother sent
Who when he understood the jest
With what he saw was well content
This shows a pious mind Quoth he
Selfconquest is true victory
The Church bath a good stomach she with zest
Whole countries hath swallowd down
And never yet a surfeit known
The Church alone be it confessed
Daughters can illgot wealth digest

FAUST

It is a general custom too
Practised alike by king and jew

MEPHISTOPHELES

With that clasp chain and ring he swept
As they were mushrooms and the casket
Without one word of thanks he kept
As if of nuts it were a basket
Promised reward in heaven then forth he hied
And greatly they were edified

FAUST

And Gretchen

MEPHISTOPHELES

In unquiet mood
Knows neither what she would or should
The trinkets night and day thinks oer
On him who brought them dwells still more

FAUST

The darlings sorrow grieves me bring
Another set without delay
The first methinks was no great thing

MEPHISTOPHELES

Alls to my gentleman childs play

FAUST

Plan all things to achieve my end
Engage the attention of her friend
No milkandwater devil be
And bring fresh jewels instantly

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ay sir Most gladly Ill obey
FAUST exit

MEPHISTOPHELES

Your doting lovesick fool with ease
Merely his ladylove to please
Sun moon and stars in sport would puff away
Exit

THE NEIGHBOURS HOUSE
MARTHA alone

God pardon my dear husband he
Doth not in truth act well by me
Forth in the world abroad to roam
And leave me on the straw at home
And yet his will I neer did thwart
God knows I lovd him from my heart
She weeps

Perchance hes deadoh wretched state
Had I but a certificate

MARGARET comes

MARGARET

Dame Martha

MARTHA

Gretchen

MARGARET

Only think
My knees beneath me wellnigh sink
Within my press Ive found today
Another case of ebony
And thingsmagnificent they are
More costly than the first by far

MARTHA

You must not name it to your mother
It would to shrift just like the other

MARGARET

Nay look at them now only see

MARTHA dresses her up

Thou happy creature

MARGARET

Woe is me
Them in the street I cannot wear
Or in the church or any where

MARTHA

Come often over here to me
The gems put on quite privately
And then before the mirror walk an hour or so
Thus we shall have our pleasure too
Then suitable occasions we must seize
As at a feast to show them by degrees
A chain at first pearl eardrops thenyour mother
Wont see them or well coin some tale or other

MARGARET

But who I wonder could the caskets bring
I fear theres something wrong about the thing
a knock

MARTHA peering through the blind

Tis a strange gentleman I see
Come in

MEPHISTOPHELES enters

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ive venturd to intrude today
Ladies excuse the liberty I pray
He steps back respectfully before MARGARET

After dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire

MARTHA

Tis I Pray what have you to say to me

MEPHISTOPHELES aside to her

I know you nowand therefore will retire
At present youve distinguished company
Pardon the freedom Madam with your leave
I will make free to call again at eve

MARTHA aloud

Why child of all strange notions he
For some grand lady taketh thee

MARGARET

I am in truth of humble blood
The gentleman is far too good
Nor gems nor trinkets are my own

MEPHISTOPHELES

Oh tis not the mere ornaments alone
Her glance and mien far more betray
Rejoiced I am that I may stay

MARTHA

Your business Sir I long to know

MEPHISTOPHELES

Would I could happier tidings show
I trust mine errand youll not let me rue
Your husbands dead and greeteth you

MARTHA

Is dead True heart Oh misery
My husband dead Oh I shall die

MARGARET

Alas good Martha dont despair

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now listen to the sad affair

MARGARET

I for this cause should fear to love
The loss my certain death would prove

MEPHISTOPHELES

Joy still must sorrow sorrow joy attend

MARTHA

Proceed and tell the story of his end

MEPHISTOPHELES

At Padua in St Anthonys
In holy ground his body lies
Quiet and cool his place of rest
With pious ceremonials blest

MARTHA

And had you naught besides to bring

MEPHISTOPHELES

Oh yes one grave and solemn prayer
Let them for him three hundred masses sing
But in my pockets I have nothing there

MARTHA

No trinket no lovetoken did he send
What every journeyman safe in his pouch will hoard
There for remembrance fondly stored
And rather hungers rather begs than spend

MEPHISTOPHELES

Madam in truth it grieves me sore
But he his gold not lavishly bath spent
His failings too he deeply did repent
Ay and his evil plight bewaild still more

MARGARET

Alas That men should thus be doomed to woe
I for his soul will many a requiem pray

MEPHISTOPHELES

A husband you deserve this very day
A child so worthy to be loved

MARGARET

Ah no
That time bath not yet come for me

MEPHISTOPHELES

If not a spouse a gallant let it be
Among heavens choicest gifts I place
So sweet a darling to embrace

MARGARET

MEPHISTOPHELES

Usage or not it happens so

MARTHA

Go on I pray

MEPHISTOPHELES

I stood by his bedside Something less foul it was than dung
Twas straw half rotten yet he as a Christian died
And sorely hath remorse his conscience wrung
Wretch that I was quoth he with parting breath
So to forsake my business and my wife
Ah the remembrance is my death
Could I but have her pardon in this life 

MARTHA weeping

Dear soul Ive long forgiven him indeed

MEPHISTOPHELES

Though she God knows was more to blame than I

MARTHA

He lied What on the brink of death to lie

MEPHISTOPHELES

If I am skilld the countenance to read
He doubtless fabled as he parted hence
No time had I to gape or take my ease he said
First to get children and then get them bread
And bread too in the very widest sense
Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share

MARTHA

What all my truth my love forgotten quite
My weary drudgery by day and night

MEPHISTOPHELES

Not so He thought of you with tender care
Quoth he Heaven knows how fervently I prayed
For wife and children when from Malta bound
The prayer hath heaven with favour crowned
We took a Turkish vessel which conveyed
Rich store of treasure for the Sultans court
Its own reward our gallant action brought
The capturd prize was shared among the crew
And of the treasure I received my due

MARTHA

How Where The treasure hath he buried pray

MEPHISTOPHELES

Where the four winds have blown it who can say
In Naples as he strolld a stranger there
A comely maid took pity on my friend
And gave such tokens of her love and care
That he retained them to his blessed end

MARTHA

Scoundrel to rob his children of their bread
And all this misery this bitter need
Could not his course of recklessness impede

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well he bath paid the forfeit and is dead
Now were I in your place my counsel hear
My weeds Id wear for one chaste year
And for another lover meanwhile would look out

MARTHA

Alas I might search far and near
Not quickly should I find another like my first
There could not be a fonder fool than mine
Only he loved too well abroad to roam
Loved foreign women too and foreign wine
And loved besides the dice accursd

MEPHISTOPHELES

All had gone swimmingly no doubt
Had he but given you at home
On his side just as wide a range
Upon such terms to you I swear
Myself with you would gladly rings exchange

MARTHA

The gentleman is surely pleasd to jest

MEPHISTOPIIELES aside

Now to be off in time were best
Shed make the very devil marry her
To MARGARET

How fares it with your heart

MARGARET

How mean you Sir

MEPHISTOPHELES aside

The sweet young innocent
aloud

Ladies farewell

MARGARET

Farewell

MARTHA

But ere you leave us quickly tell
I from a witness fain had heard
Where how and when my husband died and was interrd
To forms Ive always been attached indeed
His death I fain would in the journals read

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ay madam what two witnesses declare
Is held as valid everywhere
A gallant friend I have not far from here
Who will for you before the judge appear
Ill bring him straight

MARTHA

I pray you do

MEPHISTOPHELES

And this young lady we shall find her too
A noble youth far travelled he
Shows to the sex all courtesy

MARGARET

I in his presence needs must blush for shame

MEPHISTOPHELES

Not in the presence of a crowned king

MARTH A

The garden then behind my house well name
There well await you both this evening

A STREET

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

How is it now How speeds it Ist in train

MEPHISTOPHELES

Bravo I find you all aflame
Gretchen full soon your own youll name
This eve at neighbour Marthas her youll meet again
The woman seems expressly made
To drive the pimp and gipsys trade

FAUST

Good

MEPHISTOPHELES

But from us she something would request

FAUST

A favour claims return as this world goes

MEPHISTOPHELES

We have on oath but duly to attest
That her dead husbands limbs outstretchd repose
In holy ground at Padua

FAUST

Sage indeed
So I suppose we straight must journey there

MEPHISTOPHELES

Sancta simplicitas For that no need
Without much knowledge we have but to swear

FAUST

If you have nothing better to suggest
Against your plan I must at once protest

MEPHISTOPHELES

Oh holy man methinks I have you there
In all your life say have you neer
False witness borne until this hour
Have you of God the world and all it doth contain
Of man and that which worketh in his heart and brain
Not definitions given in words of weight and power
With front unblushing and a dauntless breast
Yet if into the depth of things you go
Touching these matters it must be confessd
As much as of Herr Schwerdtleins death you know

FAUST

Thou art and dost remain liar and sophist too

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ay if one did not take a somewhat deeper view
Tomorrow in all honour thou
Poor Gretchen wilt befool and vow
Thy souls deep love in lovers fashion

FAUST

And from my heart

MEPHISTOPHELES

All good and fair
Then deathless constancy thoult swear
Speak of one all oermastering passion
Will that too issue from the heart

FAUST

Forbear
When passion sways me and I seek to frame
Fit utterance for feeling deep intense
And for my frenzy finding no fit name
Sweep round the ample world with every sense
Grasp at the loftiest words to speak my flame
And call the glow wherewith I burn
Quenchless eternal yea eterne
Is that of sophistry a devilish play

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yet am I right

FAUST

Mark this my friend
And spare my lungs who would the right maintain
And hath a tongue wherewith his point to gain
Will gain it in the end
But come of gossip I am weary quite
Because Ive no resource thourt in the right

GARDEN

MARGARET on FAUSTS arm MARTHA with
MEPHISTOPHELES walking up and down

MARGARET

I feel it you but spare my ignorance
The gentleman to shame me stoops thus low
A traveller from complaisance
Still makes the best of things I know
Too well my humble prattle never can
Have power to entertain so wise a man

FAUST

One glance one word from thee doth charm me more
Than the worlds wisdom or the sages lore
He kisses her hand

MARGARET

Nay trouble not yourself A hand so coarse
So rude as mine how can you kiss
What constant work at home must I not do perforce
My mother too exacting is
They pass on

MARTHA

Thus sir unceasing travel is your lot

MEPHISTOPHELES

Traffic and duty urge us With what pain
Are we compelled to leave full many a spot
Where yet we dare not once remain

MARTHA

In youths wild years with vigour crownd
Tis not amiss thus through the world to sweep
But ah the evil days come round
And to a lonely grave as bachelor to creep
A pleasant thing has no one found

MEPHISTOPHELES

The prospect fills me with dismay

MARTHA

Therefore in time dear sir reflect I pray
They pass on

MARGARET

Ay out of sight is out of mind
Politeness easy is to you
Friends everywhere and not a few
Wiser than I am you will find

FAUST

O dearest trust me what doth pass for sense
Full oft is selfconceit and blindness

MARGARET

How

FAUST

Simplicity and holy innocence
When will ye learn your hallowed worth to know
Ah when will meekness and humility
Kind and allbounteous natures loftiest dower

MARGARET

Only one little moment think of me
To think of you I shall have many an hour

FAUST

You are perhaps much alone

MARGARET

Yes small our household is I own
Yet must I see to it No maid we keep
And I must cook sew knit and Sweep
Still early on my feet and late
My mother is in all things great and small
So accurate
Not that for thrift there is such pressing need
Than others we might make more show indeed
My father left behind a small estate
A house and garden near the citywall
But fairly quiet now my days I own
As soldier is my brother gone
My little sisters dead the babe to rear
Occasiond me some care and fond annoy
But I would go through all again with joy
The darling was to me so dear

FAUST

An angel sweet if it resembled thee

MARGARET

I reared it up and it grew fond of me
After my fathers death it saw the day
We gave my mother up for lost she lay
In such a wretched plight and then at length
So very slowly she regaind her strength
Weak as she was twas vain for her to try
Herself to suckle the poor babe so I
Reared it on milk and water all alone
And thus the child became as twere roy own
Within my arms it stretched itself and grew
And smiling nestled in my bosom too

FAUST

Doubtless the purest happiness was thine

MARGARET

But many weary hours in sooth were also mine
At night its little cradle stood
Close to my bed so was I wide awake
If it but stirred
One while I was obliged to give it food
Or to my arms the darling take
From bed full oft must rise wheneer its cry I heard
And dancing it must pace the chamber to and fro
Stand at the washtub early forthwith go
To market and then mind the cooking too
Tomorrow like today the whole year through
Ah sir thus living it must be confessd
Ones spirits are not always of the best
Yet it a relish gives to food and rest
They pass on

MARTHA

Poor women we are badly off I own
A bachelors conversions hard indeed

MEPHISTOPHELES

Madam with one like you it rests alone
To tutor me a better course to lead

MARTHA

Speak frankly sir none is there you have met
Has your heart neer attachd itself as yet

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ones own fireside and a good wife are gold
And pearls of price so says the proverb old

MARTHA

I mean has passion never stirred your breast

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ive everywhere been well received I own

MARTHA

Yet hath your heart no earnest preference known

MEPHISTOPHELES

With ladies one should neer presume to jest

MARTHA

Ah you mistake

MEPHISTOPHELES

Im sorry Im so blind
But this I knowthat you are very kind
They pass on

FAUST

Me little angel didst thou recognise
When in the garden first I came

MARGARET
Did you not see it I cast down my eyes

FAUST
Thou dost forgive my boldness dost not blame
The liberty I took that day
When thou from church didst lately wend thy way

MARGARET

I was confused So had it never been
No one of me could any evil say
Alas thought I he doubtless in thy mien
Something unmaidenly or bold hath seen
It seemed as if it struck him suddenly
Heres just a girl with whom one may make free
Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew
What in your favour here began at once to plead
Yet I was angry with myself indeed
That I more angry could not feel with you

FAUST

Sweet love

MARGARET

Just wait awhile
She gathers a starflower and plucks off the leaves one after
another

FAUST

A nosegay may that be

MARGARET

No It is but a game

FAUST

How

MARGARET

Go youll laugh at me
She plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself

FAUST

What murmurest thou

MARGARET half aloud

He loves meloves me not

FAUST

Sweet angel with thy face of heavenly bliss

MARGARET continues

He loves menothe loves menot
Plucking off the last leaf with fond joy

He loves me

FAUST

Yes
And this flowerlanguage darling let it be
A heavenly oracle He loveth thee
Knowst thou the meaning of He loveth thee
He seizes both her hands

MARGARET

I tremble so

FAUST

Nay Do not tremble love
Let this handpressure let this glance reveal
Feelings all power of speech above
To give oneself up wholly and to feel
A joy that must eternal prove
EternalYes its end would be despair
No endIt cannot end
MARGARET presses his hand extricates herself
and runs away He stands a moment in thought and then follows
her


MARTHA approaching

Nights closing

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes well presently away

MARTHA

I would entreat you longer yet to stay
But tis a wicked place just here about
It is as if the folk had nothing else to do
Nothing to think of too
But gaping watch their neighbours who goes in and out
And scandals busy still do whatsoeer one may
And our young couple

MEPHISTOPHELES

They have flown up there
The wanton butterflies

MARTHA

He seems to take to her

MEPHISTOPHELES

And she to him Tis of the world the way

A SUMMERHOUSE

MARGARET runs in hides behind the door holds the tip of her
finger to her lip and peeps through the crevice

MARGARET

He comes

FAUST

Ah little rogue so thou
Thinkst to provoke me I have caught thee now
He kisses her

MARGARET

embracing him and returning the kiss

Dearest of men I love thee from my heart
MEPHISTOPHELES knocks

Whos there

FAUST stamping

MEPHISTOPHELES

A friend

FAUST

A brute

MEPHISTOPHELES

MARTHA comes

Ay it is late good sir

FAUST

Maynt I attend you then

MARGARET

Oh nomy mother wouldadieu adieu

FAUST

And must I really then take leave of you Farewell

MARTHA

Goodbye

MARGARET

Ere long to meet again

Exeunt FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES

MARGARET

Good heavens how all things far and near
Must fill his minda man like this
Abashd before him I appear
And say to all things only yes
Poor simple child I cannot see
What tis that he can find in me
Exit

FOREST AND CAVERN

FAUST alone

Spirit sublime Thou gavst me gavst me all
For which I prayed Not vainly hast thou turnd
To me thy countenance in flaming fire
Gayest me glorious nature for my realm
And also power to feel her and enjoy
Not merely with a cold and wondering glance
Thou dost permit me in her depths profound
As in the bosom of a friend to gaze
Before me thou dost lead her living tribes
And dost in silent grove in air and stream
Teach me to know my kindred And when roars
The howling stormblast through the groaning wood
Wrenching the giant pine which in its fall
Crashing sweeps down its neighbour trunks and boughs
While hollow thunder from the hill resounds
Then thou dost lead me to some shelterd cave
Dost there reveal me to myself and show
Of my own bosom the mysterious depths
And when with soothing beam the moons pale orb
Full in my view climbs up the pathless sky
From crag and dewy grove the silvery forms
Of bygone ages hover and assuage
The joy austere of contemplative thought

Oh that naught perfect is assignd to man
I feel alas With this exalted joy
Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods
Thou gavst me this companion unto whom
I needs must cling though cold and insolent
He still degrades me to myself and turns
Thy glorious gifts to nothing with a breath
He in my bosom with malicious zeal
For that fair image fans a raging fire
From craving to enjoyment thus I reel
And in enjoyment languish for desire MEPHISTOPHELES
enters

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of this lone life have you not had your fill
How for so long can it have charms for you
Tis well enough to try it if you will
But then away again to something new

FAUST

Would you could better occupy your leisure
Than in disturbing thus my hours of joy

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well Well Ill leave you to yourself with pleasure
A serious tone you hardly dare employ
To part from one so crazy harsh and cross
Were not in truth a grievous loss
The livelong day for you I toil and fret
Neer from his worships face a hint I get
What pleases him or what to let alone

FAUST

Ay truly that is just the proper tone
He wearies me and would with thanks be paid

MEPHISTOPHELES

Poor Son of Earth without my aid
How would thy weary days have flown
Thee of thy foolish whims Ive cured
Thy vain imaginations banished
And but for me be well assured
Thou from this sphere must soon have vanished
In rocky hollows and in caverns drear
Why like an owl sit moping here
Wherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued
Dost suck like any toad thy food
A rare sweet pastime Verily
The doctor cleaveth still to thee

FAUST

Dost comprehend what bliss without alloy
From this wild wandring in the desert springs
Couldst thou but guess the new lifepower it brings
Thou wouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy

MEPHISTOPHELES

What superearthly ecstasy at night
To lie in darkness on the dewy height
Embracing heaven and earth in rapture high
The soul dilating to a deity
With prescient yearnings pierce the core of earth
Feel in your labouring breast the sixdays birth
Enjoy in proud delight what no one knows
While your loverapture oer creation flows
The earthly lost in beatific vision
And then the lofty intuition
With a gesture

I need not tell you howto close

FAUST

Fie on you

MEPHISTOPHELES

This displeases you For shame
You are forsooth entitled to exclaim
We to chaste ears it seems must not pronounce
What nathless the chaste heart cannot renounce
Well to be brief the joy as fit occasions rise
I grudge you not of specious lies
But long this mood thoult not retain
Already thourt again outworn
And should this last thou wilt be torn
By frenzy or remorse and pain
Enough of this Thy true love dwells apart
And all to her seems flat and tame
Alone thine image fills her heart
She loves thee with an alldevouring flame
First came thy passion with oerpowering rush
Like mountain torrent swollen by the melted snow
Pull in her heart didst pour the sudden gush
Now has thy brookiet ceased to flow
Instead of sitting throned midst forests wild
It would become so great a lord
To comfort the enamourd child
And the young monkey for her love reward
To her the hours seem miserably long
She from the window sees the clouds float by
As oer the lofty citywalls they fly
If I a birdie were so runs her song
Half through the night and all day long
Cheerful sometimes more oft at heart full sore
Fairly outwept seem now her tears
Anon she tranquil is or so appears
And lovesick evermore

FAUST

Snake Serpent vile

MEPHISTOPHELES aside

Good If I catch thee with my guile

FAUST

Vile reprobate go get thee hence
Forbear the lovely girl to name
Nor in my halfdistracted sense
Kindle anew the smouldering flame

MEPHISTOPHELES

What wouldest thou She thinks youve taken flight
It seems shes partly in the right

FAUST
Im near her stilland should I distant rove
Her I can neer forget neer lose her love
And all things touchd by those sweet lips of hers
Even the very Host my envy stirs

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis well I oft have envied you indeed
The twinpair that among the roses feed

FAUST

Pander avaunt

MEPHISTOPHELES

Go to I laugh the while you rail
The power which fashiond youth and maid
Well understood the noble trade
So neither shall occasion fail
But henceA mighty grief I trow
Unto thy lovd ones chamber thou
And not to death shouldst go

FAUST

What is to me heavens joy within her arms
What though my life her bosom warms
Do I not ever feel her woe
The outcast am I not unhoused unblest
Inhuman monster without aim or rest
Who like the greedy surge from rock to rock
Sweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock
While she within her lowly cot which graced
The Alpine slope beside the waters wild
Her homely cares in that small world embraced
Secluded lived a simple artless child
Wast not enough in thy delirious whirl
To blast the stedfast rocks
Her and her peace as well
Must I Godhated one to ruin hurl
Dost claim this holocaust remorseless Hell
Fiend help me to cut short the hours of dread
Let what must happen happen speedily
Her direful doom fall crushing on my head
And into ruin let her plunge with me

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why how again it seethes and glows
Away thou fool Her torment ease
When such a head no issue sees
It pictures straight the final close
Long life to him who boldly dares
A devils pluck thourt wont to show
As for a devil who despairs
Nothing I find so mawkish here below

MARGARETS ROOM

MARGARET
alone at her spinning wheel

My peace is gone
My heart is Sore
I find it never
And nevermore

Where him I have not
Is the grave and all
The world to me
Is turned to gall

My wilderd brain
Is overwrought
My feeble senses
Are distraught

My peace is gone
My heart is sore
I find it never
And nevermore

For him from the window
I gaze at home
For him and him only
Abroad I roam

His lofty step
His bearing high
The smile of his lip
The power of his eye

His witching words
Their tones of bliss
His hands fond pressure
And ahhis kiss

My peace is gone
My heart is sore
I find it never
And nevermore

My bosom aches
To feel him near
Ah could I clasp
And fold him here

Kiss him and kiss him
Again would I
And on his kisses
I fain would die

MARTHAS GARDEN

MARGARET and FAUST

MARGARET

Promise me Henry

FAUST

What I can

MARGARET

How thy religion fares I fain would hear
Thou art a good kindhearted man
Only that way not welldisposed I fear

FAUST

Forbear my child Thou feelest thee I love
My heart my blood Id give my love to prove
And none would of their faith or church bereave

MARGARET

Thats not enough we must ourselves believe

FAUST

Must we

MARGARET

Ah could I but thy soul inspire
Thou honourest not the sacraments alas

FAUST

I honour them

MARGARET

But yet without desire
Tis long since thou hast been either to shrift or mass
Dost thou believe in God

FAUST

My darling who dares say
Yes I in God believe
Question or priest or sage and they
Seem in the answer you receive
To mock the questioner

MARGARET

Then thou dost not believe

FAUST

Sweet one my meaning do not misconceive
Him who dare name
And who proclaim
Him I believe
Who that can feel
His heart can steel
To say I believe him not
The Allembracer
Allsustainer

Holds and sustains he not
Thee me himself
Lifts not the Heaven its dome above
Doth not the firmset earth beneath us lie
And beaming tenderly with looks of love
Climb not the everlasting stars on high
Do we not gaze into each others eyes
Natures impenetrable agencies
Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain
Viewless or visible to mortal ken
Around thee weaving their mysterious chain
Fill thence thy heart how large soeer it be
And in the feeling when thou utterly art blest
Then call it what thou wilt
Call it Bliss Heart Love God
I have no name for it
Tis feeling all
Name is but sound and smoke
Shrouding the glow of heaven

MARGARET

All this is doubtless good and fair
Almost the same the parson says
Only in slightly different phrase

FAUST

Beneath Heavens sunshine everywhere
This is the utterance of the human heart
Each in his language doth the like impart
Then why not I in mine

MARGARET

What thus I hear
Sounds plausible yet Im not reconciled
Theres something wrong about it much I fear
That thou art not a Christian

FAUST

My sweet child

MARGARET

Alas it long bath sorely troubled me
To see thee in such odious company

FAUST

How so

MARGARET

The man who comes with thee I hate
Yea in my spirits inmost depths abhor
As his loathd visage in my life before
Naught to my heart eer gave a pang so great

FAUST

Him fear not my sweet love

MARGARET

His presence chills my blood
Towards all beside I have a kindly mood
Yet though I yearn to gaze on thee I feel
At sight of him strange horror oer me steal
That hes a villain my convictions strong
May Heaven forgive me if I do him wrong

FAUST

Yet such strange fellows in the world must be

MARGARET

I would not live with such an one as he
If for a moment he but enter here
He looks around him with a mocking sneer
And malice illconceald
That he with naught on earth can sympathize is clear
Upon his brow tis legibly revealed
That to his heart no living soul is dear
So blest I feel within thine arms
So warm and happyfree from all alarms
And still my heart doth close when he comes near

FAUST

Foreboding angel check thy fear

MARGARET

It so oermasters me that when
Or wheresoeer his step I hear
I almost think no more I love thee then
Besides when he is near I neer could pray
This eats into my heart with thee
The same my Henry it must be

FAUST

This is antipathy

MARGARET

I must away

FAUST

For one brief hour then may I never rest
And heart to heart and soul to soul be pressed

MARGARET

Ah if I slept alone Tonight
The bolt I fain would leave undrawn for thee
But then my mothers sleep is light
Were we surprised by her ah me
Upon the spot I should be dead

FAUST

Dear angel theres no cause for dread
Here is a little phialif she take
Mixed in her drink three drops twill steep
Her nature in a deep and soothing sleep

MARGARET

What Do I not for thy dear sake
To her it will not harmful prove

FAUST

Should I advise it else sweet love

MARGARET

I know not dearest when thy face I see
What doth my spirit to thy will constrain
Already I have done so much for thee
That scarcely more to do doth now remain
Exit

MEPHISTOPHELES enters

MEPHISTOPHELES

The monkey Is she gone

FAUST

Again hast played the spy

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of all that passd Im well apprized
I heard the doctor catechised
And trust hell profit much thereby
Fain would the girls inquire indeed
Touching their lovers faith and creed
And whether pious in the good old way
They think if pliant there us too he will obey

FAUST

Thou monster does not see that this
Pure soul possessed by ardent love
Full of the living faith
To her of bliss
The only pledge must holy anguish prove
Holding the man she loves Foredoomed to endless death

MEPHISTOPHELES

Most sensual supersensualist The while
A damsel leads thee by the nose

FAUST

Of filth and fire abortion vile

MEPHISTOPHELES

In physiognomy strange skill she shows
She in my presence feels she knows not how
My mask it seems a hidden sense reveals
That Im a genius she must needs allow
That Im the very devil perhaps she feels
So then tonight

FAUST

Whats that to you

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ive my amusement in it too

AT THE WELL

MARGARET and BESSY with pitchers

BESSY

Of Barbara hast nothing heard

MARGARET

I rarely go from homeno not a word

BESSY

Tis true Sybilla told me so today
That comes of being proud methinks
She played the fool at last

MARGARET

How so

BESSY

They say
That two she feedeth when she eats and drinks

MARGARET

Alas

BESSY

Shes rightly served in sooth
How long she hung upon the youth
What promenades what jaunts there were
To dancing booth and village fair
The first she everywhere must shine
He always treating her to pastry and to wine
Of her good looks she was so vain
So shameless too that to retain
His presents she did not disdain
Sweet words and kisses came anon
And then the virgin flower was gone

MARGARET

Poor thing

BESSY

Forsooth dost pity her
At night when at our wheels we sat
Abroad our mothers neer would let us stir
Then with her lover she must chat
Or on the bench or in the dusky walk
Thinking the hours too brief for their Sweet talk
Her proud head she will have to bow
And in white sheet do penance now

MARGARET

But he will surely marry her

BESSY

Not he
He wont be such a fool a gallant lad
Like him can roam oer land and sea
Besides hes off

MARGARET
That is not fair

BESSY

If she should get him twere almost as bad
Her myrtle wreath the boys would tear
And then we girls would plague her too
For we choppd straw before her door would strew
Exit

MARGARET walking towards home

How stoutly once I could inveigh
If a poor maiden went astray
Not words enough my tongue could find
Gainst others sin to speak my mind
Black as it seemed I blackend it still more
And strove to make it blacker than before
And did myself securely bless
Now my own trespass doth appear
Yet ahwhat urgd me to transgress
God knows it was so sweet so dear

ZWINGER

Enclosure between the Citywall and the Gate
In the niche of the wall a devotional image of the Mater
dolorosa with flowerpots before it

MARGARET
putting fresh flowers in the pots

Ah rich in sorrow thou
Stoop thy maternal brow
And mark with pitying eye my misery
The sword in thy pierced heart
Thou dost with bitter smart
Gaze upwards on thy Sons death agony
To the dear God on high
Ascends thy piteous sigh
Pleading for his and thy sore misery
Ah who can know
The torturing woe
The pangs that rack me to the bone
How my poor heart without relief
Trembles and throbs its yearning grief
Thou knowest thou alone
Ah wheresoeer I go
With woe with woe with woe
My anguishd breast is aching
When all alone I creep
I weep I weep I weep
Alas my heart is breaking
The flowerpots at my window
Were wet with tears of mine
The while I pluckd these blossoms
At dawn to deck thy shrine
When early in my chamber
Shone bright the rising morn
I sat there on my pallet
My heart with anguish torn
Help from disgrace and death deliver me
Ah rich in sorrow thou
Stoop thy maternal brow
And mark with pitying eye my misery

NIGHT STREET BEFORE MARGARETS DOOR

VALENTINE
a soldier MARGARETS brother

When seated mong the jovial crowd
Where merry comrades boasting loud
Each named with pride his favourite lass
And in her honour draind his glass
Upon my elbows I would lean
With easy quiet view the scene
Nor give my tongue the rein until
Each swaggering blade had talked his fill
Then smiling I my beard would stroke
The while with brimming glass I spoke
Each to his tastebut to my mind
Where in the country will you find
A maid as my dear Gretchen fair
Who with my sister can compare
Cling Clang so rang the jovial sound
Shouts of assent went circling round
Pride of her sex is shecried some
Then were the noisy boasters dumb

And now II could tear out my hair
Or dash my brains out in despair
Me every scurvy knave may twit
With stinging jest and taunting sneer
Like skulking debtor I must sit
And sweat each casual word to hear
And though I smashd them one and all
Yet them I could not liars call
Who comes this way whos sneaking here
If I mistake not two draw near
If he be one have at himwell I wot
Alive he shall not leave this spot

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

How from yon sacristy athwart the night
Its beams the everburning taper throws
While ever waning fades the glimmering light
As gathering darkness doth around it close
So nightlike gloom doth in my bosom reign

MEPHISTOPHELES

Im like a tomcat in a thievish vein
That up fireladders tall and steep
And round the walls doth slyly creep
Virtuous withal I feel with I confess
A touch of thievish joy and wantonness
Thus through my limbs already burns
The glorious Walpurgis night
After tomorrow it returns
Then why one wakes one knows aright

FAUST

Meanwhile the treasure I see glimmering there
Will it ascend into the open air

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ere long thou wilt proceed with pleasure
To raise the casket with its treasure
I took a peep therein are stored
Of liondollars a rich hoard

FAUST

And not a trinket not a ring
Wherewith my lovely girl to deck

MEPHISTOPHELES

I saw among them some such thing
A string of pearls to grace her neck

FAUST

Tis well Im always loath to go
Without some gift my love to show

MEPHISTOPHELES

Some pleasures gratis to enjoy
Should surely cause you no annoy
While bright with stars the heavens appear
Ill sing a masterpiece of art
A moral song shall charm her ear
More surely to beguile her heart
Sings to the guitar

Kathrina say
Why lingering stay
At dawn of day
Before your lovers door
Maiden beware
Nor enter there
Lest forth you fare
A maiden never more

Maiden take heed
Reck well my rede
Ist done the deed
Good night you poor poor thing
The spoilers lies His arts despise
Nor yield your prize
Without the marriage ring

VALENTINE steps forward
Whom are you luring here Ill give it you
Accursed ratcatchers your strains Ill end
First to the devil the guitar Ill send
Then to the devil with the singer too

MEPHISTOPHELES

The poor guitar tis done for now

VALENTINE

Your skull shall follow next I trow

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

Doctor stand fast your strength collect
Be prompt and do as I direct
Out with your whisk keep close I pray
Ill parry I do you thrust away

VALENTINE

Then parry that

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why not

VALENTINE

That too

MEPHISTOPHELES

With ease

VALENTINE

The devil fights for you
Why how is this my hands already lamed

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

Thrust home

VALENTINE falls

Alas

MEPHISTOPHELES

There Now the lubbers tamed
But quick away We must at once take wing
A cry of murder strikes upon the ear
With the police I know my course to steer
But with the bloodban tis another thing

MARTHA at the window

Without without

MARGARET at the window

Quick bring a light

MARTHA as above

They rail and scuffle scream and fight

PEOPLE

One lieth here already dead

MARTHA coming out

Where are the murderers are they fled

MARGARET coming out

Who lieth here

PEOPLE

Thy mothers son

MARGARET

Almighty God I am undone

VALENTINE
Im dyingtis a soontold tale
And sooner done the deed
Why women do ye howl and wail
To my last words give heed All gather round him
My Gretchen see still young art thou
Art not discreet enough I trow
Thou dost thy matters ill
Let this in confidence be said
Since thou the path of shame dost tread
Tread it with right good will

MARGARET

My brother God what can this mean

VALENTINE

Abstain
Nor dare Gods holy name profane
Whats done alas is done and past
Matters will take their course at last
By stealth thou dost begin with one
Others will follow him anon
And when a dozen thee have known
Thoult common be to all the town
When infamy is newly born
In secret she is brought to light
And the mysterious veil of night
Oer head and ears is drawn
The loathsome birth men fain would slay
But soon full grown she waxes bold
And though not fairer to behold
With brazen front insults the day
The more abhorrent to the sight
The more she courts the days pure light

The time already I discern
When thee all honest folk will spurn
And shun thy hated form to meet
As when a corpse infects the street
Thy heart will sink in blank despair
When they shall look thee in the face
A golden chain no more thoult wear
Nor near the altar take in church thy place
In fair lace collar simply dight
Thoult dance no more with spirits light
In darksome corners thou wilt bide
Where beggars vile and cripples hide
And een though God thy crime forgive
On earth a thing accursed thoult live

MARTHA

Your parting soul to God commend
Your dying breath in slander will you spend

VALENTINE

Could I but reach thy witherd frame
Thou wretched beldame void of shame
Full measure I might hope to win
Of pardon then for every sin

MARGARET

VALENTINE

I tell thee from vain tears abstain
Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart
Thy fall the fatal deathstab gave
Through the deathsleep I now depart
To God a soldier true and brave
dies

CATHEDRAL

Service Organ and Anthem

MARGARET amongst a number of people

EVILSPIRIT behind MARGARET

EVILSPIRIT

How different Gretchen was it once with thee
When thou still full of innocence
Here to the altar camest
And from the small and wellconnd book
Didst lisp thy prayer
Half childish sport
Half God in thy young heart
Gretchen
What thoughts are thine
What deed of shame
Lurks in thy sinful heart
Is thy prayer utterd for thy mothers soul
Who into long long torment slept through thee
Whose blood is on thy threshold
And stirs there not already neath thy heart
Another quickning pulse that even now
Tortures itself and thee
With its foreboding presence

MARGARET

Woe Woe
Oh could I free me from the thoughts
That hither thither crowd upon my brain
Against my will

CHORUS

Dies irae dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
The organ sounds

EVILSPIRIT

Grim horror seizes thee
The trumpet sounds
The graves are shaken
And thy heart
From ashy rest
For torturing flames
Anew created
Trembles into life

MARGARET

Would I were hence
It is as if the organ
Choked my breath
As if the choir
Melted my inmost heart

CHORUS

Judex ergo cum sedebit
Quidquid latet adparebit
Nil inultunt remanebit

MARGARET

I feel oppressed
The pillars of the wall
Imprison me
The vaulted roof
Weighs down upon me Iair

EVILSPIRIT

Wouldst hide thee sin and shame
Remain not hidden
Air light
Woes thee

CHORUS

Quid sum miser tunc dicturus
Quem patronum rogaturus
Cum vix justus sit securus

EVILSPIRIT

The glorified their faces turn
Away from thee
Shudder the pure to reach
Their hands to thee
Woe

CHORUS

Quid sum miser tunc dicturus

MARGARET

Neighbour your smelling bottle
She swoons away

WALPURGISNIGHT

THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS DISTRICT OF SCHIERKE
AND ELEND

FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES

A broomstick dost thou not at least desire
The roughest hegoat fain would I bestride
By this road from our goal were still far wide

FAUST

While fresh upon my legs so long I naught require
Except this knotty staff Beside
What boots it to abridge a pleasant way
Along the labyrinth of these vales to creep
Then scale these rocks whence in eternal spray
Adown the cliffs the silvery fountains leap
Such is the joy that seasons paths like these
Spring weaves already in the birchen trees
Een the late pinegrove feels her quickening powers
Should she not work within these limbs of ours

MEPHISTOPHELES

Naught of this genial influence do I know
Within me all is wintry Frost and snow
I should prefer my dismal path to bound
How sadly yonder with belated glow
Rises the ruddy moons imperfect round
Shedding so faint a light at every tread
Ones sure to stumble gainst a rock or tree
An Ignis Fatuus I must call instead
Yonder one burning merrily I see
Holla my friend may I request your light
Why should you flare away so uselessly
Be kind enough to show us up the height

IGNIS FATUUS

Through reverence I hope I may subdue
The lightness of my nature true
Our course is but a zigzag one

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ho ho
So men forsooth he thinks to imitate
Now in the devils name for once go straight
Or out at once your flickering life Ill blow

IGNIS FAPUUS

That you are master here it obvious quite
To do your will Ill cordially essay
Only reflect The hill is magicmad tonight
And if to show the path you choose a meteors light
You must not wonder should we go astray

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES IGNIS FATUUS
in alternate song

Through the dream and magicsphere
As it seems we now are speeding
Honour win us rightly leading
That betimes we may appear
In yon wide and desert region

Trees on trees a stalwart legion
Swiftly past us are retreating
And the cliffs with lowly greeting
Rocks longsnouted row on row
How they snort and how they blow

Through the stones and heather springing
Brook and brooklet haste below
Hark the rustling Hark the singing
Hearken to loves plaintive lays
Voices of those heavenly days
What we hope and what we love
Like a tale of olden time
Echos voice prolongs the chime

Towhit Towhoo It sounds more near
Plover owl and jay appear
All awake around above
Paunchy salamanders too
Peer longlimbed the bushes through
And like snakes the roots of trees
Coil themselves from rock and sand
Stretching many a wondrous band
Us to frighten us to seize
From rude knots with life embued
Polypfangs abroad they spread
To snare the wanderer Neath our tread
Mice in myriads thousandhued
Through the heath and through the moss
And the fireflies glittering throng
Wildering escort whirls along
Here and there our path across

Tell me stand we motionless
Or still forward do we press
All things round us whirl and fly
Rocks and trees make strange grimaces
Dazzling meteors change their places
How they puff and multiply

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now grasp my doubletwe at last
A central peak have reached which shows
If round a wondering glance we cast
How in the mountain Mammon glows

FAUST

How through the chasms strangely gleams
A lurid light like dawns red glow
Pervading with its quivering beams
The gorges of the gulf below
Here vapours rise there clouds float by
Here through the mist the light doth shine
Now like a fount it bursts on high
Meanders now a slender line
Far reaching with a hundred veins
Here through the valley see it glide
Here where its force the gorge restrains
At once it scatters far and wide
Anear like showers of golden sand
Strewn broadcast sputter sparks of light
And mark yon rocky walls that stand
Ablaze in all their towering height

MEPHISTOPHELES

Doth not Sir Mammon for this fete
Grandly illume his palace Thou
Art lucky to have seen it now
The boisterous guests I feel are coming straight

FAUST

How through the air the storm doth whirl
Upon my neck it strikes with sudden shock

MEPHISTOPHELES

Cling to these ancient ribs of granite rock
Else to yon depths profound it you will hurl
A murky vapour thickens night
Hark Through the woods the tempests roar
The owlets flit in wild affright
Hark Splinterd are the columns that upbore
The leafy palace green for aye
The shivered branches whirr and sigh
Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan
The roots upriven creak and moan
In fearful and entangled fall
One crashing ruin whelms them all
While through the desolate abyss
Sweeping the wreckstrewn precipice
The raging stormblasts howl and hiss
Aloft strange voices dost thou hear
Distant now and now more near
Hark the mountain ridge along
Streameth a raving magicsong

WITCHES in chorus

Now to the Brocken the witches hie
The stubble is yellow the corn is green
Thither the gathering legions fly
And sitting aloft is Sir Urial seen
Oer stick and oer stone they go whirling along
Witches and hegoats a motley throng

VOICES

Alone old Baubos coming now
She rides upon a farrow sow

CHORUS

Honour to her to whom honour is due
Forward Dame Baubo Honour to you
A goodly sow and mother thereon
The whole witch chorus follows anon

VOICE

Which way didst come

VOICE

Oer Ilsenstein
There I peepd in an owlets nest
With her broad eye she gazed in mine

VOICE

Drive to the devil thou hellish pest
Why ride so hard

VOICE

She has grazd my side
Look at the wounds how deep and how wide

WITCHES in chorus

The way is broad the way is long
What mad pursuit What tumult wild
Scratches the besom and sticks the prong
Crushd is the mother and stifled the child

WIZARDS half chorus

Like houseencumberd Snail we creep
While far ahead the women keep
For when to the devils house we speed
By a thousand steps they take the lead

THE OTHER HALF

Not so precisely do we view it
They with a thousand steps may do it

But let them hasten as they can
With one long bound tis cleard by man

VOICES above

Come with us come with us from Felsensee

VOICES from below

Aloft to you we would mount with glee
We wash and free from all stain are we
Yet barren evermore must be

BOTH CHORUSES

The wind is hushed the stars grow pale
The pensive moon her light doth veil
And whirling on the magic choir
Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire

VOICE from below

Stay stay

VOICE from above

What voice of woe
Calls from the cavernd depths below

VOICE from below

Take me with you Oh take me too
Three centuries I climb in vain
And yet can neer the summit gain
To be with my kindred I am fain

BOTH CHORUSES

Broom and pitchfork goat and prong
Mounted on these we whirl along
Who vainly strives to climb tonight
Is evermore a luckless wight

DEMIWITCH below

I hobble after many a day
Already the others are far away

No rest at home can I obtain
Here too my efforts are in vain

CHORUS OF WITCHES

Salve gives the witches strength to rise
A rag for a sail does well enough
A goodly ship is every trough
Tonight who flies not never flies

BOTH CHORUSES

And when the topmost peak we round
Then alight ye on the ground
The heaths wide regions cover ye
With your mad swarms of witchery
They let themselves down

MEPHISTOPHELES

They crowd and jostle whirl and flutter
They whisper babble twirl and splutter
They glimmer sparkle stink and flare
A true witchelement
Beware
Stick close else we shall severed be
Where art thou

FAUST in the distance

Here

MEPHISTOPHELES

Already whirld so far away
The master then indeed I needs must play
Give ground Squire Voland comes
Sweet folk give ground
Here doctor grasp me With a single bound
Let us escape this ceaseless jar
Even for me too mad these people are
Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare
Yon brake allureth me it is not far
Come come along with me well slip in there

FAUST

Spirit of contradiction Lead Ill follow straight
Twas wisely done however to repair
On Maynight to the Brocken and when there
By our own choice ourselves to isolate

MEPHISTOPHELES

Murk of those flames the motley glare
A merry club assembles there
In a small circle one is not alone

FAUST

Id rather be above though I must own
Already fire and eddying smoke I view
The impetuous millions to the devil ride
Full many a riddle will be there untied

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ay and full many a riddle tied anew
But let the great world rave and riot
Here will we house ourselves in quiet
A custom tis of ancient date
Our lesser worlds within the great world to create
Young witches there I see naked and bare
And old ones veild more prudently
For my sake only courteous be
The troubles small the sport is rare
Of instruments I hear the cursed din
One must get used to it
Come in come in
Theres now no help for it Ill step before
And introducing you as my good friend
Confer on you one obligation more
How say you now Tis no such paltry room
Why only look you scarce can see the end
A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom
They dance they talk they cook make love and drink
Where could we find aught better do you think

FAUST

To introduce us do you purpose here
As devil or as wizard to appear

MEPHISTOPHELES

Though I am wont indeed to strict incognito
Yet upon galadays one must ones orders show
No garter have I to distinguish me
Nathless the cloven foot doth here give dignity
Seest thou yonder snail Crawling this way she hies
With searching feelers she no doubt
Hath me already scented out
Here even if I would for me theres no disguise
From fire to fire well saunter at our leisure
The gallant you Ill cater for your pleasure
To a party seated round some expiring embers
Old gentleman apart why sit ye moping here
Ye in the midst should be of all this jovial cheer
Girt round with noise and youthful riot
At home one surely has enough of quiet

GENERAL

In nations put his trust who may
Whateer for them one may have done
For with the people as with women they
Honour your rising stars alone

MINISTER

Now all too far they wander from the right
I praise the good old ways to them I hold
Then was the genuine age of gold
When we ourselves were foremost in mens sight

PARVENU

Neer were we mong your dullards found
And what we ought not that to do were fair

Yet now are all things turning round and round
When on firm basis we would them maintain

AUTHOR

Who as a rule a treatise now would care
To read of even moderate sense
As for the rising generation neer
Has youth displayed such arrogant pretence

MEPHISTOPHELES
suddenly appearing very old

Since for the last time I the Brocken scale
That folk are ripe for doomsday now one sees
And just because my cask begins to fail
So the whole world is also on the lees

HUCKSTERWITCH

Stop gentlemen nor pass me by
Of wares I have a choice collection
Pray honour them with your inspection
Lose not this opportunity
Yet nothing in my booth youll find
Without its counterpart on earth theres naught
Which to the world and to mankind
Hath not some direful mischief wrought
No dagger here which bath not flowd with blood
No chalice whence into some healthy frame
Hath not been poured hot poisons wasting flood
No trinket but bath wrought some womans shame
No weapon but bath cut some sacred tie
Or from behind bath stabbd an enemy

MEPHISTOPHELES

Gossip For wares like these the times gone by
Whats done is past whats past is done
With novelties your booth supply
Us novelties attract alone

FAUST

May this wild scene my senses spare
This may in truth be called a fair

MEPHISTOPHELES

Upward the eddying concourse throng
Thinking to push thyself art pushd along

FAUST

Whos that pray

MEPHISTOPHELES

Mark her well Thats Lilith

FAUST

Who

MEPHISTOPHELES

Adams first wife Of her rich locks beware
That charm in which shes paralleld by few
When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare
He will not soon escape I promise you

FAUST

There sit a pair the old one with the young
Already they have bravely danced and sprung

MEPHISTOPHELES

Here there is no repose today
Another dance begins well join it come away

FAUST
dancing with the young one

Once a fair vision came to me
Therein I saw an appletree
Two beauteous apples charmed mine eyes
I climbd forthwith to reach the prize

THE FAIR ONE

Apples still fondly ye desire
From paradise it bath been so
Feelings of joy my breast inspire
That such too in my garden grow

MEPHISTOPHELES with the old one

Once a weird vision came to me
Therein I saw a rifted tree
I had a     have ready here
But as it was it pleased me too

THE OLD ONE

I beg most humbly to salute
The gallant with the cloven foot
Let him a    have ready here
If he a    does not fear

PROCTOPHANTASMIST

Accursed mob How dare ye thus to meet
Have I not shown and demonstrated too
That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet
Yet here ye dance as other mortals do

THE FAIR ONE dancing

Then at our ball what doth he here

FAUST dancing

Oh He must everywhere appear
He must adjudge when others dance
If on each step his says not said
So is that step as good as never made
Hes most annoyed so soon as we advance
If ye would circle in one narrow round
As he in his old mill then doubtless he
Your dancing would approveespecially
If ye forthwith salute him with respect profound

PROCTOPHANTASMIST

Still here what arrogance unheard of quite
Vanish we now have filld the world with light
Laws are unheeded by the devils host
Wise as we are yet Tegel hath its ghost
How long at this conceit Ive swept with all my might
Lost is the labour tis unheard of quite

THE FAIR ONE

Cease here to teaze us any more I pray

PROCTOPHANTASMIST

Spirits I plainly to your face declare
No spiritual control myself will bear
Since my own spirit can exert no sway
The dancing continues

Tonight I see I shall in naught succeed
But Im prepard my travels to pursue
And hope before my final step indeed
To triumph over bards and devils too

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now in some puddle will he take his station
Such is his mode of seeking consolation
Where leeches feasting on his rump will drain
Spirits alike and spirit from his brain
To FAUST who has left the dance

But why the charming damsel leave I pray
Who to you in the dance so sweetly sang

FAUST

Ah in the very middle of her lay
Out of her mouth a small red mouse there sprang

MEPHISTOPHELES

Suppose there did One must not be too nice
Twas well it was not grey let that suffice
Who mid his pleasures for a trifle cares

FAUST

Then saw I

MEPHISTOPHELES

What

FAUST

Mephisto seest thou there
Standing far off a lone child pale and fair
Slow from the spot her drooping form she tears
And seems with shackled feet to move along
I own within me the delusions strong
That she the likeness of my Gretchen wears

MEPHISTOPHELES

Gaze not upon her Tis not good Forbear
Tis lifeless magical a shape of air
An idol Such to meet with bodes no good
That rigid look of hers doth freeze mans blood
And wellnigh petrifies his heart to stone
The story of Medusa thou hast known

FAUST

Ay verily a corpses eyes are those
Which there was no fond loving hand to close
That is the bosom I so fondly pressd
That my sweet Gretchens form so oft caressd

MEPHISTOPHELES

Deluded fool Tis magic I declare
To each she doth his lovd
ones image wear

FAUST

What bliss what torture vainly I essay
To turn me from that piteous look away
How strangely doth a single crimson line
Around that lovely neck its coil entwine
It shows no broader than a knifes blunt edge

MEPHISTOPHELES

Quite right I see it also and allege
That she beneath her arm her head can bear
Since Perseus cut it offBut you I swear
Are craving for illusion still
Come then ascend yon little hill
As on the Prater all is gay
And if my senses are not gone
I see a theatrewhats going on

SERVIRILIS

They are about to recommencethe play
Will be the last of seven and spickspan new
Tis usual here that number to present
A dilettante did the piece invent
And dilettanti will enact it too
Excuse me gentlemen to mes assignd
As dilettante to uplift the curtain

MEPHISTOPHELES

You on the Blocksberg Im rejoiced to find
That tis your most appropriate sphere is certain

WALPURGISNIGHTS DREAM
OR OBERON AND TITANIAS GOLDEN WEDDINGFEAST

Intermezzo

THEATRE

MANAGER

Vales where mists still shift and play
To ancient hills succeeding
These our scenesso we today
May rest brave sons of Mieding

HERALD

That the marriage golden be
Must fifty years be ended
More dear this feast of gold to me
Contention now suspended

OBERON

Spirits if present grace the scene
And if with me united
Then gratulate the king and queen
Their troth thus newly plighted

PUCK

Puck draws near and wheels about
In mazy circles dancing
Hundreds swell his joyous shout
Behind him still advancing

ARIEL

Ariel wakes his dainty air
His lyre celestial stringing
Fools he lureth and the fair
With his celestial singing

OBERON

Wedded ones would ye agree
We court your imitation
Would ye fondly love as we
We counsel separation

TITANIA

If husband scold and wife retort
Then bear them far asunder
Her to the burning south transport
And him the North Pole under

THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA fortissimo

Flies and midges all unite
With frog and chirping cricket
Our orchestra throughout the night
Resounding in the thicket

Solo
Yonder doth the bagpipe come
Its sack an airy bubble
Schnick schnick schnack with nasal hum
Its notes it doth redouble

EMBRYO SPIRIT

Spiders foot and midges wing
A toad in form and feature
Together verses it can string
Though scarce n living creature

A LITTLE PAIR

Tiny step and lofty bound
Through dew and exhalation
Ye trip it deftly on the ground
But gain no elevation

INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER

Can I indeed believe my eyes
Ist not mere masquerading
What Oberon in beauteous step
Among the groups parading

ORTHODOX

No claws no tail to whisk about
To fright us at our revel
Yet like the gods of Greece no doubt
He toos a genuine devil

NORTHERN ARTIST

These that Im hitting off today
Are sketches unpretending
Towards Italy without delay
My steps I think of bending

PURIST

Alas illfortune leads me here
Where riot still grows louder
And mong the witches gatherd here
But two alone wear powder

YOUNG WITCH

Your powder and your petticoat
Suit hags theres no gainsaying
Hence I sit fearless on my goat
My naked charms displaying

MATRON

Were too wellbred to squabble here
Or insult back to render
But may you wither soon my dear
Although so young and tender

LEADER OF THE BAND

Nose of fly and gnats proboscis
Throng not the naked beauty
Frogs and crickets in the mosses
Keep time and do your duty

WEATHERCOCK towards one side

What charming company I view
Together here collected
Gay bachelors a hopeful crew
And brides so unaffected

WEATHERCOCK towards the other side

Unless indeed the yawning ground
Should open to receive them
From this vile crew with sudden bound
To Hell Id jump and leave them

XENIEN

With small sharp shears in insect guise
Behold us at your revel
That we may tender filialwise
Our homage to the devil

HENNINGS

Look now at yonder eager crew
How naively theyre jesting
That they have tender hearts and true
They stoutly keep protesting

MUSAGET

Oneself amid this witchery
How pleasantly one loses
For witches easier are to me
To govern than the Muses

CIDEVANT GENIUS OF THE AGE

With proper folks when we appear
No one can then surpass us
Keep close wide is the Blocksberg here
As Germanys Parnassus

INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER

How name ye that stiff formal man
Who strides with lofty paces
He tracks the game whereer he can
He scents the Jesuits traces

CRANE

Where waters troubled are or clear
To fish I am delighted
Thus pious gentlemen appear
With devils here united

WORLDLING

By pious people it is true
No medium is rejected
Conventicles and not a few
On Blocksberg are erected

DANCER

Another chorus now succeeds
Far off the drums are beating
Be still The bitterns mong the reeds
Their one note are repeating

DANCING MASTER

Each twirls about and never stops
And as he can he fareth
The crooked leaps the clumsy hops
Nor for appearance careth

FIDDLER

To take each others life I trow
Would cordially delight them
As Orpheus lyre the beasts so now
The bagpipe doth unite them

DOGMATIST

My views in spite of doubt and sneer
I hold with stout persistence
Inferring from the devils here
The evil ones existence

IDEALIST

My every sense rules Phantasy
With sway quite too potential
Sure Im demented if the I
Alone is the essential

REALIST

This entitys a dreadful bore
And cannot choose but vex me
The ground beneath me neer before
Thus totterd to perplex me

SUPERNATURALIST

Well pleased assembled here I view
Of spirits this profusion
From devils touching angels too
I gather some conclusion

SCEPTIC

The ignis fatuus they track out
And think theyre near the treasure
Devil alliterates with doubt
Here I abide with pleasure

LEADER OF THE BAND

Frog and cricket in the mosses
Confound your gasconading
Nose of fly and gnats proboscis
Most tuneful serenading

THE KNOWING ONES

Sanssouci so this host we greet
Their jovial humour showing
Theres now no walking on our feet
So on our heads were going

THE AWKWARD ONES

In seasons past we snatchd tis true
Some titbits by our cunning
Our shoes alas are now danced through
On our bare soles were running

WILLOTHEWISPS

From marshy bogs we sprang to light
Yet here behold us dancing
The gayest gallants of the night
In glittring rows advancing

SHOOTING STAR

With rapid motion from on high
I shot in starry splendour
Now prostrate on the grass I lie
Who aid will kindly render

THE MASSIVE ONES

Room wheel round Theyre coming lo
Down sink the bending grasses
Though spirits yet their limbs we know
Are huge substantial masses

PUCK

Dont stamp so heavily I pray
Like elephants youre treading
And mong the elves be Puck today
The stoutest at the wedding

ARIEL

If nature boon or subtle sprite
Endow your soul with pinions
Then follow to yon rosy height
Through ethers calm dominions

ORCHESTRA pianissimo

Drifting cloud and misty wreathes
Are filld with light elysian
Oer reed and leaf the zephyr breathes
So fades the fairy vision

A GLOOMY DAY A PLAIN

FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

In misery despairing long wandering pitifully on the face of the
earth and now imprisoned This gentle hapless creature immured
in the dungeon as a malefactor and reserved for horrid tortures
That it should come to this To thisPerfidious worthless spirit
and this thou hast concealed from meStand ay stand roll in
malicious rage thy fiendish eyes Stand and brave me with thine
insupportable presence Imprisoned In hopeless misery Delivered
over to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying
humanity IAnd me the while thou wert lulling with tasteless
dissipations concealing from me her growing anguish and leaving
her to perish without help

MEPHISTOPHELES

She is not the first

FAUST

Hound Execrable monsterBack with him oh thou infinite
spirit back with the reptile into his dogs shape in which it was his
wont to scamper before me at eventide to roll before the feet of
the harmless wanderer and to fasten on his shoulders when he fell
Change him again into his favourite shape that he may crouch on
his belly before me in the dust whilst I spurn him with my foot
the reprobateNot the firstWoe Woe By no human soul is it
conceivable that more than one human creature has ever sunk into
a depth of wretchedness like this or that the first in her writhing
deathagony should not have atoned in the sight of allpardoning
Heaven for the guilt of all the rest The misery of this one pierces
me to the very marrow and harrows up my soul thou art grinning
calmly over the doom of thousands

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now we are once again at our wits end just where the reason of
you mortals snaps Why dost thou seek our fellowship if thou
canst not go through with it Wilt fly and art not proof against
dizziness Did we force ourselves on thee or thou on us

FAUST

Cease thus to gnash thy ravenous fangs at me I loathe theeGreat
and glorious spirit thou who didst vouchsafe to reveal thyself unto
me thou who dost know my very heart and soul why hast thou
linked me with this base associate who feeds on mischief and
revels in destruction

MEPHISTOPHELES

Hast done

FAUST

Save heror woe to thee The direst of curses on thee for
thousands of years

MEPHISTOPHELES

I cannot loose the bands of the avenger nor withdraw his
boltsSave herWho was it plunged her into perdition I or
thou

FAUST looks wildly around

MEPHISTOPHELES

Wouldst grasp the thunder Well for you poor mortals that tis
not yours to wield To smite to atoms the being however innocent
who obstructs his path such is the tyrants fashion of relieving
himself in difficulties

FAUST

Convey me thither She shall be free

MEPHISTOPHELES

And the danger to which thou dust expose thyself Know the guilt
of blood shed by thy hand lies yet upon the town Over the place
where fell the murdered one avenging spirits hover and watch for
the returning murderer

FAUST

This too from thee The death and downfall of a world be on thee
monster I Conduct me thither I say and set
her free

MEPHISTOPHELES

I will conduct thee And what I can dohear Have I all power in
heaven and upon earth Ill cloud the senses of the warderdo
thou possess thyself of the keys and lead her forth with human
hand I will keep watch The magic steeds are waiting I bear thee
off Thus much is in my power

FAUST

Tip and sway

NIGHT OPEN COUNTRY

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

Rushing along on black horses

FAUST

What weave they yonder round the Ravenstone

MEPHISTOPHELES

I know not what they shape and brew

FAUST

Theyre soaring swooping betiding stooping

MEPHISTOPHELES

A witches pack

FAUST

They charm they strew

MEPHISTOPHELES

On On

DUNGEON

FAUST
with a bunch of keys and a lamp before a small iron door

A fear unwonted oer my spirit falls
Mans concentrated woe oerwhelms me here
She dwells immurd within these dripping walls
Her only trespass a delusion dear
Thou lingerest at the fatal door
Thou dreadst to see her face once more
On While thou dalliest draws her deathhour near
He seizes the lock Singing within
My mother the harlot
She took me and slew
My father the scoundrel
Hath eaten me too
My sweet little sister
Hath all my bones laid
Where soft breezes whisper
All in the cool shade
Then became I a woodbird and sang on the spray
Fly away little bird fly away fly away

FAUST opening the lock

Ah she forebodes not that her lovers near
The clanking chains the rustling straw to hear
He enters

MARGARET
hiding her face in the bed of straw

Woe woe they come oh bitter tis to die

FAUST softly

Hush hush be still I come to set thee free

MARGARET
throwing herself at his feet

If thou art human feel my misery

FAUST

Thou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry
He grasps the chains to unlock them

MARGARET on her knees

Who headsman unto thee this power
Oer me could give
Thou comst for me at midnighthour
Be merciful and let me live
Is morrows dawn not time enough
She stands up

Im still so young so young
And must so early die
Fair was I too and that was my undoing
My love is now afar he then was nigh
Torn lies the garland the fair blossoms strewd
Nay seize me not with hand so rude
Spare me What harm have I eer done to thee
Oh let me not in vain implore
I neer have seen thee in my life before

FAUST
Can I endure this bitter agony

MARGARET

I now am at thy mercy quite
Let me my babe but suckle once again
I fondled it the livelong night
They took it from me but to give me pain
And now they say that I my child have slain
Gladness I neer again shall know
Then they sing songs about metis wicked of the throng
An ancient ballad endeth so
Who bade them thus apply the song

FAUST
throwing himself on the ground

A lover at thy feet bends low
To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe

MARGARET
throws herself beside him

Oh let us kneel and move the saints by prayer
Look look yon stairs below
Under the threshold there
Hells flames are all aglow
Beneath the floor
With hideous noise
The devils roar

FAUST aloud

Gretchen Gretchen

MARGARET listening

That was my lovd ones voice
She springs up the chains fall off

Where is he I heard him calling me
Free am I Theres none shall hinder me
To his neck will I fly
On his bosom will lie

Gretchen he called
On yon threshold he stood
Amidst all the howling of hells fiery flood
The scoff and the scorn of its devilish crew
The tones of his voice sweet and loving I knew

FAUST

Tis I

MARGARET

Tis thou O say so once again
embracing him

Tis he Tis he wheres now the torturing pain
Where are the fetters where the dungeons gloom
Tis thou To save me thou art come
And I am savd
Already now the street I see
Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee
There too the pleasant garden shade
Where I and Martha for thy coming stayd

FAUST
endeavouring to lead her away

Come come away

MARGARET

Oh do not haste
I love to linger where thou stayest caressing him

FAUST

Ah haste For if thou still delayest
Our lingering we shall both deplore

MARGARET

How dearest canst thou kiss no more
So short a time away from me and yet
To kiss thou couldst so soon forget
Why on thy neck so anxious do I feel
When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss
From thy dear looks and words would oer me steal
As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss
Kiss me
Or Ill kiss thee She embraces him

Woe woe Thy lips are cold Are dumb
Thy love where hast thou left
Who bath me of thy love bereft
She turns away from him

FAUST

Come Follow me my dearest love be bold
Ill cherish thee with ardour thousandfold
I but entreat thee now to follow me

MARGARET
turning towards him

And art thou he and art thou really he

FAUST

Tis I O come

MARGARET

Thou wilt strike off my chain
And thou wilt take me to thine arms again
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me
And dost thou know love whom thou wouldst set free

FAUST

Come come already night begins to wane

MARGARET

I sent my mother to her grave
I drownd my child beneath the wave
Was it not given to thee and methee too
Tis thou thyself I scarce believe it yet
Give me thy hand It is no dream Tis true
Thine own dear handBut how is this Tis wet
Quick wipe it off Meseems that yet
Theres blood thereon
Ah God what hast thou done
Put up thy sword I beg of thee

FAUST

Oh dearest let the past forgotten be
Death is in every word

MARGARET

No thou must linger here in sorrow
The graves I will describe to thee
And thou to them must see
Tomorrow
The best place give to my mother
Close at her side my brother
Me at some distance lay
But not too far away
And the little one place on my right breast
Nobody else will near me lie
To nestle beside thee so lovingly
That was a rapture gracious and sweet
A rapture I never again shall prove
Methinks I would force myself on thee love
And thou dost spurn me and back retreat
Yet tis thyself thy fond kind looks I see

FAUST

If thou dost feel tis I then come with me

MARGARET

What there without

FAUST

Yes forth in the free air

MARGARET

Ay if the graves without
If death lurk there
Hence to the everlasting restingplace
And not one step beyond
Thourt leaving me
Oh Henry would that I could go with thee

FAUST

Thou canst But will it
Open stands the door

MARGARET

I dare not go Ive naught to hope for more
What boots it to escape They lurk for me
Tis wretched to beg as I must do
And with an evil conscience thereto
Tis wretched in foreign lands to stray
And me they will catch do what I may

FAUST

With thee will I abide

MARGARET

Quick Quick
Save thy poor child
Keep to the path
The brook along
Over the bridge
To the wood beyond
To the left where the plank is
In the pond
Seize it at once
It fain would rise
It struggles still
Save it Oh save

FAUST

Dear Gretchen more collected be
One little step and thou art free

MARGARET

Were we but only past the hill
There sits my mother upon a stone
My brain alas is cold with dread
There sits my mother upon a stone
And to and fro she shakes her head
She winks not she nods not her head it droops sore
She slept so long she waked no more
She slept that we might taste of bliss
Ah those were happy times I wis

FAUST

Since here avails nor argument nor prayer
Thee hence by force I needs must bear

MARGARET

Loose me I will not suffer violence
With murderous hand hold not so fast
I have done all to please thee in the past

FAUST

Day dawns My love My love

MARGARET

Yes day draws near
The day of judgment too will soon appear
It should have been my bridal No one tell
That thy poor Gretchen thou hast known too well
Woe to my garland
Its bloom is oer
Though not at the dance
We shall meet once more
The crowd doth gather in silence it rolls
The squares the streets
Scarce hold the throng
The staff is brokenthe deathbell tolls
They bind and seize me
Im hurried along
To the seat of blood already Im bound
Quivers each neck as the naked steel
Quivers on mine the blow to deal
The silence of the grave now broods around

FAUST

Would I had never been born

MEPHISTOPHELES appears without

Up or youre lost
Vain hesitation Babbling quaking
My steeds are shivering
Morn is breaking

MARGARET

What from the floor ascendeth like a ghost
Tis he Tis he Him from my presence chase
What would he in this holy place
It is for me he cometh

FAUST

Thou shalt live

MARGARET

Judgment of God To thee my soul I give

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

Come come With her Ill else abandon thee

MARGARET

Father Im thine Do thou deliver me
Ye angels Ye angelic hosts descend
Encamp around to guard me and defend
Henry I shudder now to look on thee

MEPHISTOPHELES

She now is judged

VOICES from above

Is saved

MEPHISTOPHELES to FAUST

Come thou with me
Vanishes with FAUST

VOICE from within dying away
