BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

Although Bret Hartes name is identified with Californian life it was
not till he was fifteen that the author of Plain Language from Truthful
James saw the country of his adoption Francis Bret Harte to give the
full name which he carried till he became famous was born at Albany
New York August 25 1839 He went with his widowed mother to
California in 1854 and was thrown as a young man into the hurlyburly
which he more than any other writer has made real to distant and later
people He was by turns a miner schoolteacher express messenger
printer and journalist The types which live again in his pages are
thus not only what he observed but what he himself impersonated in his
own experience

He began trying his pen in The Golden Era of San Francisco where he was
working as a compositor and when The Californian edited by Charles
Henry Webb was started in 1864 as a literary newspaper he was one of a
group of brilliant young fellowsMark Twain Charles Warren Stoddard
Webb himself and Prentice Mulfordwho gave at once a new interest in
California beside what mining and agriculture caused Here in an early
number appeared The Ballad of the Emeu and he contributed many poems
grave and gay as well as prose in a great variety of form At the same
time he was appointed Secretary of the United States Branch Mint at San
Francisco holding the office till 1870

But Bret Hartes great opportunity came when The Overland Monthly was
established in 1868 by Anton Roman This magazine was the outgrowth of
the racy exuberant literary spirit which had already found free
expression in the journals named An eager ambition to lift all the new
life of the Pacific into a recognized place in the world of letters made
the young men we have named put their wits together in a monthly
magazine which should rival the Atlantic in Boston and Blackwood in
Edinburgh The name was easily had and for a sign manual on the cover
some one drew a grizzly bear that formidable exemplar of Californian
wildness But the design did not quite satisfy until Bret Harte with
a felicitous stroke drew two parallel lines just before the feet of the
halting brute Now it was the grizzly of the wilderness drawing back
before the railway of civilization and the picture was complete as an
emblem

Bret Harte became by the common urgency of his companions the first
editor of the Overland and at once his own tales and poems began and
in the second number appeared The Luck of Roaring Camp which
instantly brought him wide fame In a few months he found himself
besought for poems and articles sketches and stories in influential
magazines and in 1871 he turned away from the Pacific coast and took
up his residence first in New York afterward in Boston

No one says his old friend Mr Stoddard who knows Mr Harte and
knew the California of his day wonders that he left it as he did
Eastern editors were crying for his work Cities vied with one another
in the offer of tempting bait When he turned his back on San
Francisco and started for Boston he began a tour that the greatest
author of any age might have been proud of It was a veritable ovation
that swelled from sea to sea the classic sheep was sacrificed all along
the route I have often thought that if Bret Harte had met with a fatal
accident during that transcontinental journey the world would have
declared with one voice that the greatest genius of his time was lost to
it

In Boston he entered into an arrangement with the predecessors of the
publishers of this volume and his contributions appeared in their
periodicals and were gathered into volumes The arrangement in one form
or another continued to the time of his death and has for witness a
stately array of comely volumes but the prose has far outstripped the
poetry There are few writers of Mr Hartes prodigality of nature who
have used with so much fine reserve their faculty for melodious verse
and the present volume contains the entire body of his poetical work
growing by minute accretions during thirty odd years

In 1878 he was appointed United States Consul at Crefeld Germany and
after that date he resided with little interruption on the Continent
or in England He was transferred to Glasgow in March 1880 and
remained there until July 1885 During the rest of his life he made
his home in London His foreign residence is disclosed in a number of
prose sketches and tales and in one or two poems but life abroad never
dimmed the vividness of the impressions made on him by the experience of
his early manhood when he partook of the elixir vitae of California and
the stories which from year to year flowed from an apparently
inexhaustible fountain glittered with the gold washed down from the
mountain slopes of that country which through his imagination he had
made so peculiarly his own

Mr Harte died suddenly at Camberley England May 6 1902

 JOHN BURNS OF GETTYSBURG

 Have you heard the story that gossips tell
 Of Burns of GettysburgNo Ah well
 Brief is the glory that hero earns
 Briefer the story of poor John Burns
 He was the fellow who won renown
 The only man who didnt back down
 When the rebels rode through his native town
 But held his own in the fight next day
 When all his townsfolk ran away
 That was in July sixtythree
 The very day that General Lee
 Flower of Southern chivalry
 Baffled and beaten backward reeled
 From a stubborn Meade and a barren field

 I might tell how but the day before
 John Burns stood at his cottage door
 Looking down the village street
 Where in the shade of his peaceful vine
 He heard the low of his gathered kine
 And felt their breath with incense sweet
 Or I might say when the sunset burned
 The old farm gable he thought it turned
 The milk that fell like a babbling flood
 Into the milkpail red as blood
 Or how he fancied the hum of bees
 Were bullets buzzing among the trees
 But all such fanciful thoughts as these
 Were strange to a practical man like Burns
 Who minded only his own concerns
 Troubled no more by fancies fine
 Than one of his calmeyed longtailed kine
 Quite oldfashioned and matteroffact
 Slow to argue but quick to act
 That was the reason as some folk say
 He fought so well on that terrible day

 And it was terrible On the right
 Raged for hours the heady fight
 Thundered the batterys double bass
 Difficult music for men to face
 While on the leftwhere now the graves
 Undulate like the living waves
 That all that day unceasing swept
 Up to the pits the rebels kept
 Round shot ploughed the upland glades
 Sown with bullets reaped with blades
 Shattered fences here and there
 Tossed their splinters in the air
 The very trees were stripped and bare
 The barns that once held yellow grain
 Were heaped with harvests of the slain
 The cattle bellowed on the plain
 The turkeys screamed with might and main
 And brooding barnfowl left their rest
 With strange shells bursting in each nest

 Just where the tide of battle turns
 Erect and lonely stood old John Burns
 How do you think the man was dressed
 He wore an ancient long buff vest
 Yellow as saffronbut his best
 And buttoned over his manly breast
 Was a bright blue coat with a rolling collar
 And large gilt buttonssize of a dollar
 With tails that the countryfolk called swaller
 He wore a broadbrimmed bellcrowned hat
 White as the locks on which it sat
 Never had such a sight been seen
 For forty years on the village green
 Since old John Burns was a country beau
 And went to the quiltings long ago

 Close at his elbows all that day
 Veterans of the Peninsula
 Sunburnt and bearded charged away
 And striplings downy of lip and chin
 Clerks that the Home Guard mustered in
 Glanced as they passed at the hat he wore
 Then at the rifle his right hand bore
 And hailed him from out their youthful lore
 With scraps of a slangy repertoire
 How are you White Hat Put her through
 Your heads level and Bully for you
 Called him Daddybegged hed disclose
 The name of the tailor who made his clothes
 And what was the value he set on those
 While Burns unmindful of jeer and scoff
 Stood there picking the rebels off
 With his long brown rifle and bellcrown hat
 And the swallowtails they were laughing at

 Twas but a moment for that respect
 Which clothes all courage their voices checked
 And something the wildest could understand
 Spake in the old mans strong right hand
 And his corded throat and the lurking frown
 Of his eyebrows under his old bellcrown
 Until as they gazed there crept an awe
 Through the ranks in whispers and some men saw
 In the antique vestments and long white hair
 The Past of the Nation in battle there
 And some of the soldiers since declare
 That the gleam of his old white hat afar
 Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre
 That day was their oriflamme of war

 So raged the battle You know the rest
 How the rebels beaten and backward pressed
 Broke at the final charge and ran
 At which John Burnsa practical man
 Shouldered his rifle unbent his brows
 And then went back to his bees and cows

 That is the story of old John Burns
 This is the moral the reader learns
 In fighting the battle the questions whether
 Youll show a hat thats white or a feather




HOW ARE YOU SANITARY

 Down the picketguarded lane
 Rolled the comfortladen wain
 Cheered by shouts that shook the plain
 Soldierlike and merry
 Phrases such as camps may teach
 Sabrecuts of Saxon speech
 Such as Bully Thems the peach
 Wade in Sanitary

 Right and left the caissons drew
 As the car went lumbering through
 Quick succeeding in review
 Squadrons military
 Sunburnt men with beards like frieze
 Smoothfaced boys and cries like these
 U S San Com Thats the cheese
 Pass in Sanitary

 In such cheer it struggled on
 Till the battle front was won
 Then the car its journey done
 Lo was stationary
 And where bullets whistling fly
 Came the sadder fainter cry
 Help us brothers ere we die
 Save us Sanitary

 Such the work The phantom flies
 Wrapped in battle clouds that rise
 But the bravewhose dying eyes
 Veiled and visionary
 See the jasper gates swung wide
 See the parted throng outside
 Hears the voice to those who ride
 Pass in Sanitary




BATTLE BUNNY

 MALVERN HILL 1864


 After the men were ordered to lie down a white rabbit which had
 been hopping hither and thither over the field swept by grape and
 musketry took refuge among the skirmishers in the breast of a
 corporalReport of the Battle of Malvern Hill


 Bunny lying in the grass
 Saw the shining column pass
 Saw the starry banner fly
 Saw the chargers fret and fume
 Saw the flapping hat and plume
 Saw them with his moist and shy
 Most unspeculative eye
 Thinking only in the dew
 That it was a fine review

 Till a flash not all of steel
 Where the rolling caissons wheel
 Brought a rumble and a roar
 Rolling down that velvet floor
 And like blows of autumn flail
 Sharply threshed the iron hail

 Bunny thrilled by unknown fears
 Raised his soft and pointed ears
 Mumbled his prehensile lip
 Quivered his pulsating hip
 As the sharp vindictive yell
 Rose above the screaming shell
 Thought the world and all its men
 All the charging squadrons meant
 All were rabbithunters then
 All to capture him intent
 Bunny was not much to blame
 Wiser folk have thought the same
 Wiser folk who think they spy
 Every ill begins with I

 Wildly panting here and there
 Bunny sought the freer air
 Till he hopped below the hill
 And saw lying close and still
 Men with muskets in their hands
 Never Bunny understands
 That hypocrisy of sleep
 In the vigils grim they keep
 As recumbent on that spot
 They elude the level shot

 Onea grave and quiet man
 Thinking of his wife and child
 Far beyond the Rapidan
 Where the Androscoggin smiled
 Felt the little rabbit creep
 Nestling by his arm and side
 Wakened from strategic sleep
 To that soft appeal replied
 Drew him to his blackened breast
 And But you have guessed the rest

 Softly oer that chosen pair
 Omnipresent Love and Care
 Drew a mightier Hand and Arm
 Shielding them from every harm
 Right and left the bullets waved
 Saved the saviour for the saved

 

 Who believes that equal grace
 God extends in every place
 Little difference he scans
 Twixt a rabbits God and mans




THE REVEILLE

 Hark I hear the tramp of thousands
 And of armed men the hum
 Lo a nations hosts have gathered
 Round the quick alarming drum
 Saying Come
 Freemen come
 Ere your heritage be wasted said the quick alarming drum

 Let me of my heart take counsel
 War is not of life the sum
 Who shall stay and reap the harvest
 When the autumn days shall come
 But the drum
 Echoed Come
 Death shall reap the braver harvest said the solemnsounding drum

 But when won the coming battle
 What of profit springs therefrom
 What if conquest subjugation
 Even greater ills become
 But the drum
 Answered Come
 You must do the sum to prove it said the Yankee answering drum

 What if mid the cannons thunder
 Whistling shot and bursting bomb
 When my brothers fall around me
 Should my heart grow cold and numb
 But the drum
 Answered Come
 Better there in death united than in life a recreantCome

 Thus they answeredhoping fearing
 Some in faith and doubting some
 Till a trumpetvoice proclaiming
 Said My chosen people come
 Then the drum
 Lo was dumb
 For the great heart of the nation throbbing answered Lord we come




OUR PRIVILEGE

 Not ours where battle smoke upcurls
 And battle dews lie wet
 To meet the charge that treason hurls
 By sword and bayonet

 Not ours to guide the fatal scythe
 The fleshless Reaper wields
 The harvest moon looks calmly down
 Upon our peaceful fields

 The long grass dimples on the hill
 The pines sing by the sea
 And Plenty from her golden horn
 Is pouring far and free

 O brothers by the farther sea
 Think still our faith is warm
 The same bright flag above us waves
 That swathed our baby form

 The same red blood that dyes your fields
 Here throbs in patriot pride
 The blood that flowed when Lander fell
 And Bakers crimson tide

 And thus apart our hearts keep time
 With every pulse ye feel
 And Mercys ringing gold shall chime
 With Valors clashing steel




RELIEVING GUARD

 THOMAS STARR KING OBIIT MARCH 4 1864

 Came the relief What sentry ho
 How passed the night through thy long waking
 Cold cheerless darkas may befit
 The hour before the dawn is breaking

 No sight no sound No nothing save
 The plover from the marshes calling
 And in yon western sky about
 An hour ago a star was falling

 A star Theres nothing strange in that
 No nothing but above the thicket
 Somehow it seemed to me that God
 Somewhere had just relieved a picket




THE GODDESS

 CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAIR FOR THE LADIES PATRIOTIC FUND OF THE PACIFIC

 Who comes The sentrys warning cry
 Rings sharply on the evening air
 Who comes The challenge no reply
 Yet something motions there

 A woman by those graceful folds
 A soldier by that martial tread
 Advance three paces Halt until
 Thy name and rank be said

 My name Her name in ancient song
 Who fearless from Olympus came
 Look on me Mortals know me best
 In battle and in flame

 Enough I know that clarion voice
 I know that gleaming eye and helm
 Those crimson lipsand in their dew
 The best blood of the realm

 The young the brave the good and wise
 Have fallen in thy curst embrace
 The juices of the grapes of wrath
 Still stain thy guilty face

 My brother lies in yonder field
 Face downward to the quiet grass
 Go back he cannot see thee now
 But here thou shalt not pass

 A crack upon the evening air
 A wakened echo from the hill
 The watchdog on the distant shore
 Gives mouth and all is still

 The sentry with his brother lies
 Face downward on the quiet grass
 And by him in the pale moonshine
 A shadow seems to pass

 No lance or warlike shield it bears
 A helmet in its pitying hands
 Brings water from the nearest brook
 To meet his last demands

 Can this be she of haughty mien
 The goddess of the sword and shield
 Ah yes The Grecian poets myth
 Sways still each battlefield

 For not alone that rugged War
 Some grace or charm from Beauty gains
 But when the goddess work is done
 The womans still remains




ON A PEN OF THOMAS STARR KING

 This is the reed the dead musician dropped
 With tuneful magic in its sheath still hidden
 The prompt allegro of its music stopped
 Its melodies unbidden

 But who shall finish the unfinished strain
 Or wake the instrument to awe and wonder
 And bid the slender barrel breathe again
 An organpipe of thunder

 His pen what humbler memories cling about
 Its golden curves what shapes and laughing graces
 Slipped from its point when his full heart went out
 In smiles and courtly phrases

 The truth half jesting half in earnest flung
 The word of cheer with recognition in it
 The note of alms whose golden speech outrung
 The golden gift within it

 But all in vain the enchanters wand we wave
 No stroke of ours recalls his magic vision
 The incantation that its power gave
 Sleeps with the dead magician




A SECOND REVIEW OF THE GRAND ARMY

 I read last night of the grand review
 In Washingtons chiefest avenue
 Two hundred thousand men in blue
 I think they said was the number
 Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet
 The bugle blast and the drums quick beat
 The clatter of hoofs in the stony street
 The cheers of people who came to greet
 And the thousand details that to repeat
 Would only my verse encumber
 Till I fell in a reverie sad and sweet
 And then to a fitful slumber

 When lo in a vision I seemed to stand
 In the lonely Capitol On each hand
 Far stretched the portico dim and grand
 Its columns ranged like a martial band
 Of sheeted spectres whom some command
 Had called to a last reviewing
 And the streets of the city were white and bare
 No footfall echoed across the square
 But out of the misty midnight air
 I heard in the distance a trumpet blare
 And the wandering nightwinds seemed to bear
 The sound of a far tattooing

 Then I held my breath with fear and dread
 For into the square with a brazen tread
 There rode a figure whose stately head
 Oerlooked the review that morning
 That never bowed from its firmset seat
 When the living column passed its feet
 Yet now rode steadily up the street
 To the phantom bugles warning

 Till it reached the Capitol square and wheeled
 And there in the moonlight stood revealed
 A wellknown form that in State and field
 Had led our patriot sires
 Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp
 Afar through the rivers fog and damp
 That showed no flicker nor waning lamp
 Nor wasted bivouac fires

 And I saw a phantom army come
 With never a sound of fife or drum
 But keeping time to a throbbing hum
 Of wailing and lamentation
 The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill
 Of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville
 The men whose wasted figures fill
 The patriot graves of the nation

 And there came the nameless deadthe men
 Who perished in fever swamp and fen
 The slowlystarved of the prison pen
 And marching beside the others
 Came the dusky martyrs of Pillows fight
 With limbs enfranchised and bearing bright
 I thoughtperhaps twas the pale moonlight
 They looked as white as their brothers

 And so all night marched the nations dead
 With never a banner above them spread
 Nor a badge nor a motto brandished
 No marksave the bare uncovered head
 Of the silent bronze Reviewer
 With never an arch save the vaulted sky
 With never a flower save those that lie
 On the distant gravesfor love could buy
 No gift that was purer or truer

 So all night long swept the strange array
 So all night long till the morning gray
 I watched for one who had passed away
 With a reverent awe and wonder
 Till a blue cap waved in the lengthning line
 And I knew that one who was kin of mine
 Had come and I spakeand lo that sign
 Awakened me from my slumber




THE COPPERHEAD

 1864

 There is peace in the swamp where the Copperhead sleeps
 Where the waters are stagnant the white vapor creeps
 Where the musk of Magnolia hangs thick in the air
 And the lilies phylacteries broaden in prayer
 There is peace in the swamp though the quiet is death
 Though the mist is miasma the upastrees breath
 Though no echo awakes to the cooing of doves
 There is peace yes the peace that the Copperhead loves

 Go seek him he coils in the ooze and the drip
 Like a thong idly flung from the slavedrivers whip
 But beware the false footstepthe stumble that brings
 A deadlier lash than the overseer swings
 Never arrow so true never bullet so dread
 As the straight steady stroke of that hammershaped head
 Whether slave or proud planter who braves that dull crest
 Woe to him who shall trouble the Copperheads rest

 Then why waste your labors brave hearts and strong men
 In tracking a trail to the Copperheads den
 Lay your axe to the cypress hew open the shade
 To the free sky and sunshine Jehovah has made
 Let the breeze of the North sweep the vapors away
 Till the stagnant lake ripples the freed waters play
 And then to your heel can you righteously doom
 The Copperhead born of its shadow and gloom




A SANITARY MESSAGE

 Last night above the whistling wind
 I heard the welcome rain
 A fusillade upon the roof
 A tattoo on the pane
 The keyhole piped the chimneytop
 A warlike trumpet blew
 Yet mingling with these sounds of strife
 A softer voice stole through

 Give thanks O brothers said the voice
 That He who sent the rains
 Hath spared your fields the scarlet dew
 That drips from patriot veins
 Ive seen the grass on Eastern graves
 In brighter verdure rise
 But oh the rain that gave it life
 Sprang first from human eyes

 I come to wash away no stain
 Upon your wasted lea
 I raise no banners save the ones
 The forest waves to me
 Upon the mountain side where Spring
 Her farthest picket sets
 My reveille awakes a host
 Of grassy bayonets

 I visit every humble roof
 I mingle with the low
 Only upon the highest peaks
 My blessings fall in snow
 Until in tricklings of the stream
 And drainings of the lea
 My unspent bounty comes at last
 To mingle with the sea

 And thus all night above the wind
 I heard the welcome rain
 A fusillade upon the roof
 A tattoo on the pane
 The keyhole piped the chimneytop
 A warlike trumpet blew
 But mingling with these sounds of strife
 This hymn of peace stole through




THE OLD MAJOR EXPLAINS

 REUNION ARMY OF THE POTOMAC 12TH MAY 1871

 Well you see the fact is Colonel I dont know as I can come
 For the farm is not half planted and theres work to do at home
 And my leg is getting troublesomeit laid me up last fall
 And the doctors they have cut and hacked and never found the ball

 And then for an old man like me its not exactly right
 This kind o playing soldier with no enemy in sight
 The Unionthat was well enough way up to 66
 But this ReUnion maybe now its mixed with politics

 No Well you understand it best but then you see my lad
 Im deacon now and some might think that the examples bad
 And week from next is Conference You said the twelfth of May
 Why thats the day we broke their line at Spottsylvania

 Hot work eh Colonel wasnt it Ye mind that narrow front
 They called it the DeathAngle Well well my lad we wont
 Fight that old battle over now I only meant to say
 I really cant engage to come upon the twelfth of May

 Hows Thompson What will he be there Well now I want to know
 The first man in the rebel works they called him Swearing Joe
 A wild young fellow sir I fear the rascal was but then
 Well short of heaven there want a place he dursnt lead his men

 And Dick you say is coming too And Billy ah its true
 We buried him at Gettysburg I mind the spot do you
 A little field below the hillit must be green this May
 Perhaps thats why the fields about bring him to me today

 Well well excuse me Colonel but there are some things that drop
 The tailboard out ones feelings and the only ways to stop
 So they want to see the old man ah the rascals do they eh
 Well Ive business down in Boston about the twelfth of May




CALIFORNIAS GREETING TO SEWARD

 1869

 We know him well no need of praise
 Or bonfire from the windy hill
 To light to softer paths and ways
 The worldworn man we honor still

 No need to quote the truths he spoke
 That burned through years of war and shame
 While History carves with surer stroke
 Across our map his noonday fame

 No need to bid him show the scars
 Of blows dealt by the Scaean gate
 Who lived to pass its shattered bars
 And see the foe capitulate

 Who lived to turn his slower feet
 Toward the western setting sun
 To see his harvest all complete
 His dream fulfilled his duty done

 The one flag streaming from the pole
 The one faith borne from sea to sea
 For such a triumph and such goal
 Poor must our human greeting be

 Ah rather that the conscious land
 In simpler ways salute the Man
 The tall pines bowing where they stand
 The bared head of El Capitan

 The tumult of the waterfalls
 Pohonos kerchief in the breeze
 The waving from the rocky walls
 The stir and rustle of the trees

 Till lapped in sunset skies of hope
 In sunset lands by sunset seas
 The Young Worlds Premier treads the slope
 Of sunset years in calm and peace




THE AGED STRANGER

 AN INCIDENT OF THE WAR

 I was with Grantthe stranger said
 Said the farmer Say no more
 But rest thee here at my cottage porch
 For thy feet are weary and sore

 I was with Grantthe stranger said
 Said the farmer Nay no more
 I prithee sit at my frugal board
 And eat of my humble store

 How fares my boymy soldier boy
 Of the old Ninth Army Corps
 I warrant he bore him gallantly
 In the smoke and the battles roar

 I know him not said the aged man
 And as I remarked before
 I was with Grant Nay nay I know
 Said the farmer say no more

 He fell in battleI see alas
 Thoudst smooth these tidings oer
 Nay speak the truth whatever it be
 Though it rend my bosoms core

 How fell he With his face to the foe
 Upholding the flag he bore
 Oh say not that my boy disgraced
 The uniform that he wore

 I cannot tell said the aged man
 And should have remarked before
 That I was with Grantin Illinois
 Some three years before the war

 Then the farmer spake him never a word
 But beat with his fist full sore
 That aged man who had worked for Grant
 Some three years before the war




THE IDYL OF BATTLE HOLLOW

 WAR OF THE REBELLION 1884

 No I wontthar now so And it aint nothinno
 And thars nary to tell that you folks yer dont know
 And its Belle tell us do and its Belle is it true
 And Wots this yer yarn of the Major and you
 Till Im sick of it allso I am but I spose
 Thet is nothin to you Well then listen yer goes

 It was after the fight and around us all night
 Thar was poppin and shootin a powerful sight
 And the niggers had fled and Aunt Chlo was abed
 And Pinky and Milly were hid in the shed
 And I ran out at daybreak and nothin was nigh
 But the growlin of cannon low down in the sky

 And I saw not a thing as I ran to the spring
 But a splintered fence rail and a brokendown swing
 And a bird said Kerchee as it sat on a tree
 As if it was lonesome and glad to see me
 And I filled up my pail and was risin to go
 When up comes the Major acanterin slow

 When he saw me he drew in his reins and then threw
 On the gatepost his bridle andwhat does he do
 But come down where I sat and he lifted his hat
 And he sayswell thar aint any need to tell THAT
 Twas some foolishness sure but it mounted to this
 Thet he asked for a drink and he wanteda kiss

 Then I said I was mad For the water my lad
 Youre too big and must stoop for a kiss its as bad
 You aint near big enough And I turned in a huff
 When that Major he laid his white hand on my cuff
 And he says Youre a trump Take my pistol dont fear
 But shoot the next man that insults you my dear

 Then he stooped to the pool very quiet and cool
 Leavin me with that pistol stuck there like a fool
 When thar flashed on my sight a quick glimmer of light
 From the top of the little stone fence on the right
 And I knew twas a rifle and back of it all
 Rose the face of that bushwhacker Cherokee Hall

 Then I felt in my dread that the moment the head
 Of the Major was lifted the Major was dead
 And I stood still and white but Lord gals in spite
 Of my care that derned pistol went off in my fright
 Went offtrue as gospiland strangest of all
 It actooally injured that Cherokee Hall

 Thets allnow go long Yes some folks thinks its wrong
 And thars some wants to know to what side I belong
 But I says Served him right and I go all my might
 In love or in war for a fair standup fight
 And as for the Majorsho gals dont you know
 ThetLord thars his step in the garden below




CALDWELL OF SPRINGFIELD

 NEW JERSEY 1780

 Heres the spot Look around you Above on the height
 Lay the Hessians encamped By that church on the right
 Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers And here ran a wall
 You may dig anywhere and youll turn up a ball
 Nothing more Grasses spring waters run flowers blow
 Pretty much as they did ninetythree years ago

 Nothing more did I say Stay one moment youve heard
 Of Caldwell the parson who once preached the word
 Down at Springfield What no Comethats bad why he had
 All the Jerseys aflame And they gave him the name
 Of the rebel high priest He stuck in their gorge
 For he loved the Lord Godand he hated King George

 He had cause you might say When the Hessians that day
 Marched up with Knyphausen they stopped on their way
 At the farms where his wife with a child in her arms
 Sat alone in the house How it happened none knew
 But Godand that one of the hireling crew
 Who fired the shot Enoughthere she lay
 And Caldwell the chaplain her husband away

 Did he preachdid he pray Think of him as you stand
 By the old church todaythink of him and his band
 Of militant ploughboys See the smoke and the heat
 Of that reckless advance of that straggling retreat
 Keep the ghost of that wife foully slain in your view
 And what could you what should you what would YOU do

 Why just what HE did They were left in the lurch
 For the want of more wadding He ran to the church
 Broke the door stripped the pews and dashed out in the road
 With his arms full of hymnbooks and threw down his load
 At their feet Then above all the shouting and shots
 Rang his voice Put Watts into em Boys give em Watts

 And they did That is all Grasses spring flowers blow
 Pretty much as they did ninetythree years ago
 You may dig anywhere and youll turn up a ball
 But not always a hero like thisand thats all




POEM

 DELIVERED ON THE FOURTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF CALIFORNIAS ADMISSION
 INTO THE UNION SEPTEMBER 9 1864

 We meet in peace though from our native East
 The sun that sparkles on our birthday feast
 Glanced as he rose on fields whose dews were red
 With darker tints than those Aurora spread
 Though shorn his rays his welcome disk concealed
 In the dim smoke that veiled each battlefield
 Still striving upward in meridian pride
 He climbed the walls that East and West divide
 Saw his bright face flashed back from golden sand
 And sapphire seas that lave the Western land

 Strange was the contrast that such scenes disclose
 From his high vantage oer eternal snows
 There Wars alarm the brazen trumpet rings
 Here his lovesong the mailed cicala sings
 There bayonets glitter through the forest glades
 Here yellow cornfields stack their peaceful blades
 There the deep trench where Valor finds a grave
 Here the long ditch that curbs the peaceful wave
 There the bold sapper with his lighted train
 Here the dark tunnel and its stores of gain
 Here the full harvest and the wains advance
 There the Grim Reaper and the ambulance

 With scenes so adverse what mysterious bond
 Links our fair fortunes to the shores beyond
 Why come we herelast of a scattered fold
 To pour new metal in the broken mould
 To yield our tribute stamped with Caesars face
 To Caesar stricken in the marketplace

 Ah love of country is the secret tie
 That joins these contrasts neath one arching sky
 Though brighter paths our peaceful steps explore
 We meet together at the Nations door
 War winds her horn and giant cliffs go down
 Like the high walls that girt the sacred town
 And bares the pathway to her throbbing heart
 From clustered village and from crowded mart

 Part of Gods providence it was to found
 A Nations bulwark on this chosen ground
 Not Jesuits zeal nor pioneers unrest
 Planted these pickets in the distant West
 But He who first the Nations fate forecast
 Placed here His fountains sealed for ages past
 Rockribbed and guarded till the coming time
 Should fit the people for their work sublime
 When a new Moses with his rod of steel
 Smote the tall cliffs with one wideringing peal
 And the old miracle in record told
 To the new Nation was revealed in gold

 Judge not too idly that our toils are mean
 Though no new levies marshal on our green
 Nor deem too rashly that our gains are small
 Weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall
 See where thick vapor wreathes the battleline
 There Mercy follows with her oil and wine
 Or where brown Labor with its peaceful charm
 Stiffens the sinews of the Nations arm
 What nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow
 And hurl its legions on the rebel foe
 Lo for each town new rising oer our State
 See the foes hamlet waste and desolate
 While each new factory lifts its chimney tall
 Like a fresh mortar trained on Richmonds wall

 For this O brothers swings the fruitful vine
 Spread our broad pastures with their countless kine
 For this oerhead the arching vault springs clear
 Sunlit and cloudless for one half the year
 For this no snowflake eer so lightly pressed
 Chills the warm impulse of our mothers breast
 Quick to reply from meadows brown and sere
 She thrills responsive to Springs earliest tear
 Breaks into blossom flings her loveliest rose
 Ere the white crocus mounts Atlantic snows
 And the example of her liberal creed
 Teaches the lesson that today we heed

 Thus ours the lot with peaceful generous hand
 To spread our bounty oer the suffering land
 As the deep cleft in Mariposas wall
 Hurls a vast river splintering in its fall
 Though the rapt soul who stands in awe below
 Sees but the arching of the promised bow
 Lo the far streamlet drinks its dews unseen
 And the whole valley wakes a brighter green




MISS BLANCHE SAYS

 And you are the poet and so you want
 Somethingwhat is ita theme a fancy
 Something or other the Muse wont grant
 To your old poetical necromancy
 Why one half you poetsyou cant deny
 Dont know the Muse when you chance to meet her
 But sit in your attics and mope and sigh
 For a faineant goddess to drop from the sky
 When flesh and blood may be standing by
 Quite at your service should you but greet her

 What if I told you my own romance
 Women are poets if you so take them
 One third poetthe rest what chance
 Of man and marriage may choose to make them
 Give me ten minutes before you go
 Here at the window well sit together
 Watching the currents that ebb and flow
 Watching the world as it drifts below
 Up the hot Avenues dusty glow
 Isnt it pleasant this bright June weather

 Well it was after the war broke out
 And I was a schoolgirl fresh from Paris
 Papa had contracts and roamed about
 And Idid nothingfor I was an heiress
 Picked some lint now I think perhaps
 Knitted some stockingsa dozen nearly
 Havelocks made for the soldiers caps
 Stood at fairtables and peddled traps
 Quite at a profit The shoulderstraps
 Thought I was pretty Ah thank you really

 Still it was stupid Ratatattat
 Those were the sounds of that battle summer
 Till the earth seemed a parchment round and flat
 And every footfall the tap of a drummer
 And day by day down the Avenue went
 Cavalry infantry all together
 Till my pitying angel one day sent
 My fate in the shape of a regiment
 That halted just as the day was spent
 Here at our door in the bright June weather

 None of your dandy warriors they
 Men from the West but where I know not
 Haggard and travelstained worn and gray
 With never a ribbon or lace or bowknot
 And I opened the window and leaning there
 I felt in their presence the free winds blowing
 My neck and shoulders and arms were bare
 I did not dream they might think me fair
 But I had some flowers that night in my hair
 And here on my bosom a red rose glowing

 And I looked from the window along the line
 Dusty and dirty and grim and solemn
 Till an eye like a bayonet flash met mine
 And a dark face shone from the darkening column
 And a quick flame leaped to my eyes and hair
 Till cheeks and shoulders burned all together
 And the next I found myself standing there
 With my eyelids wet and my cheeks less fair
 And the rose from my bosom tossed high in air
 Like a blooddrop falling on plume and feather

 Then I drew back quickly there came a cheer
 A rush of figures a noise and tussle
 And then it was over and high and clear
 My red rose bloomed on his guns black muzzle
 Then far in the darkness a sharp voice cried
 And slowly and steadily all together
 Shoulder to shoulder and side to side
 Rising and falling and swaying wide
 But bearing above them the rose my pride
 They marched away in the twilight weather

 And I leaned from my window and watched my rose
 Tossed on the waves of the surging column
 Warmed from above in the sunset glows
 Borne from below by an impulse solemn
 Then I shut the window I heard no more
 Of my soldier friend nor my flower neither
 But lived my life as I did before
 I did not go as a nurse to the war
 Sick folks to me are a dreadful bore
 So I didnt go to the hospital either

 You smile O poet and what do you
 You lean from your window and watch lifes column
 Trampling and struggling through dust and dew
 Filled with its purposes grave and solemn
 And an act a gesture a facewho knows
 Touches your fancy to thrill and haunt you
 And you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows
 And down it flies like my red red rose
 And you sit and dream as away it goes
 And think that your duty is donenow dont you

 I know your answer Im not yet through
 Look at this photographIn the Trenches
 That dead man in the coat of blue
 Holds a withered rose in his hand That clenches
 Nothingexcept that the sun paints true
 And a woman is sometimes propheticminded
 And thats my romance And poet you
 Take it and mould it to suit your view
 And who knows but you may find it too
 Come to your heart once more as mine did




AN ARCTIC VISION

 Where the shortlegged Esquimaux
 Waddle in the ice and snow
 And the playful Polar bear
 Nips the hunter unaware
 Where by day they track the ermine
 And by night another vermin
 Segment of the frigid zone
 Where the temperature alone
 Warms on St Elias cone
 Polar dock where Nature slips
 From the ways her icy ships
 Land of fox and deer and sable
 Shore end of our western cable
 Let the news that flying goes
 Thrill through all your Arctic floes
 And reverberate the boast
 From the cliffs off Beecheys coast
 Till the tidings circling round
 Every bay of Norton Sound
 Throw the vocal tidewave back
 To the isles of Kodiac
 Let the stately Polar bears
 Waltz around the pole in pairs
 And the walrus in his glee
 Bare his tusk of ivory
 While the bold seaunicorn
 Calmly takes an extra horn
 All ye Polar skies reveal your
 Very rarest of parhelia
 Trip it all ye merry dancers
 In the airiest of Lancers
 Slide ye solemn glaciers slide
 One inch farther to the tide
 Nor in rash precipitation
 Upset Tyndalls calculation
 Know you not what fate awaits you
 Or to whom the future mates you
 All ye icebergs make salaam
 You belong to Uncle Sam

 On the spot where Eugene Sue
 Led his wretched Wandering Jew
 Stands a form whose features strike
 Russ and Esquimaux alike
 He it is whom Skalds of old
 In their Runic rhymes foretold
 Lean of flank and lank of jaw
 See the real Northern Thor
 See the awful Yankee leering
 Just across the Straits of Behring
 On the drifted snow too plain
 Sinks his fresh tobacco stain
 Just beside the deep inden
 Tation of his Number 10

 Leaning on his icy hammer
 Stands the hero of this drama
 And above the wildducks clamor
 In his own peculiar grammar
 With its linguistic disguises
 La the Arctic prologue rises
 Wall I reckon taint so bad
 Seein ez twas all they had

 True the Springs are rather late
 And early Falls predominate
 But the icecrops pretty sure
 And the air is kind o pure
 Taint so very mean a trade
 When the land is all surveyed
 Theres a right smart chance for furchase
 All along this recent purchase
 And unless the stories fail
 Every fish from cod to whale
 Rocks too mebbe quartz lets see
 Twould be strange if there should be
 Seems Ive heerd such stories told
 Ehwhy bless usyes its gold

 While the blows are falling thick
 From his California pick
 You may recognize the Thor
 Of the vision that I saw
 Freed from legendary glamour
 See the real magicians hammer




ST THOMAS

 A GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEY 1868

 Very fair and full of promise
 Lay the island of St Thomas
 Ocean oer its reefs and bars
 Hid its elemental scars
 Groves of cocoanut and guava
 Grew above its fields of lava
 So the gem of the Antilles
 Isles of Eden where no ill is
 Like a great green turtle slumbered
 On the sea that it encumbered

 Then said William Henry Seward
 As he cast his eye to leeward
 Quite important to our commerce
 Is this island of St Thomas

 Said the Mountain ranges Thankee
 But we cannot stand the Yankee
 Oer our scars and fissures poring
 In our very vitals boring
 In our sacred caverns prying
 All our secret problems trying
 Digging blasting with dynamit
 Mocking all our thunders Damn it
 Other lands may be more civil
 Bust our lava crust if we will

 Said the Sea its white teeth gnashing
 Through its coralreef lips flashing
 Shall I let this scheming mortal
 Shut with stone my shining portal
 Curb my tide and check my play
 Fence with wharves my shining bay
 Rather let me be drawn out
 In one awful waterspout

 Said the blackbrowed Hurricane
 Brooding down the Spanish Main
 Shall I see my forces zounds
 Measured by square inch and pounds
 With detectives at my back
 When I double on my track
 And my secret paths made clear
 Published oer the hemisphere
 To each gaping prying crew
 Shall I Blow me if I do

 So the Mountains shook and thundered
 And the Hurricane came sweeping
 And the people stared and wondered
 As the Sea came on them leaping
 Each according to his promise
 Made things lively at St Thomas

 Till one morn when Mr Seward
 Cast his weather eye to leeward
 There was not an inch of dry land
 Left to mark his recent island
 Not a flagstaff or a sentry
 Not a wharf or port of entry
 Onlyto cut matters shorter
 Just a patch of muddy water
 In the open ocean lying
 And a gull above it flying




OFF SCARBOROUGH

 SEPTEMBER 1779

 I

 Have a care the bailiffs cried
 From their cockleshell that lay
 Off the frigates yellow side
 Tossing on Scarborough Bay
 While the forty sail it convoyed on a bowline stretched away
 Take your chicks beneath your wings
 And your claws and feathers spread
 Ere the hawk upon them springs
 Ere around Flamborough Head
 Swoops Paul Jones the Yankee falcon with his beak and talons red

 II

 How we laughedmy mate and I
 On the Bon Homme Richards deck
 As we saw that convoy fly
 Like a snowsquall till each fleck
 Melted in the twilight shadows of the coastline speck by speck
 And scuffling back to shore
 The Scarborough bailiffs sped
 As the Richard with a roar
 Of her cannon round the Head
 Crossed her royal yards and signaled to her consort Chase ahead

 III

 But the devil seize Landais
 In that consort ship of France
 For the shabby lubber way
 That he worked the Alliance
 In the offingnor a broadside fired save to our mischance
 When tumbling to the van
 With his battlelanterns set
 Rose the burly Englishman
 Gainst our hull as black as jet
 Rode the yellowsided Serapis and all alone we met

 IV

 All alone though far at sea
 Hung his consort rounding to
 All alone though on our lee
 Fought our Pallas stanch and true
 For the first broadside around us both a smoky circle drew
 And like champions in a ring
 There was cleared a little space
 Scarce a cables length to swing
 Ere we grappled in embrace
 All the world shut out around us and we only face to face

 V

 Then awoke all hell below
 From that broadside doubly curst
 For our long eighteens in row
 Leaped the first discharge and burst
 And on deck our men came pouring fearing their own guns the worst
 And as dumb we lay till through
 Smoke and flame and bitter cry
 Hailed the Serapis Have you
 Struck your colors Our reply
 We have not yet begun to fight went shouting to the sky

 VI

 Roux of Brest old fisher lay
 Like a herring gasping here
 Bunker of Nantucket Bay
 Blown from out the port dropped sheer
 Half a cables length to leeward yet we faintly raised a cheer
 As with his own right hand
 Our Commodore made fast
 The foemans headgear and
 The Richards mizzenmast
 And in that deathlock clinging held us there from first to last

 VII

 Yet the foeman gun on gun
 Through the Richard tore a road
 With his gunners rammers run
 Through our ports at every load
 Till clear the blue beyond us through our yawning timbers showed
 Yet with entrails torn we clung
 Like the Spartan to our fox
 And on deck no coward tongue
 Wailed the enemys hard knocks
 Nor that all below us trembled like a wreck upon the rocks

 VIII

 Then a thought rose in my brain
 As through Channel mists the sun
 From our tops a fire like rain
 Drove below decks every one
 Of the enemys ships company to hide or work a gun
 And that thought took shape as I
 On the Richards yard lay out
 That a man might do and die
 If the doing brought about
 Freedom for his home and country and his messmates cheering shout

 IX

 Then I crept out in the dark
 Till I hung above the hatch
 Of the Serapisa mark
 For her marksmenwith a match
 And a handgrenade but lingered just a moment more to snatch
 One last look at sea and sky
 At the lighthouse on the hill
 At the harvestmoon on high
 And our pine flag fluttering still
 Then turned and down her yawning throat I launched that devils pill

 X

 Then a blank was all between
 As the flames around me spun
 Had I fired the magazine
 Was the victory lost or won
 Nor knew I till the fight was oer but half my work was done
 For I lay among the dead
 In the cockpit of our foe
 With a roar above my head
 Till a trampling to and fro
 And a lantern showed my mates face and I knew what now you know




CADET GREY

 CANTO I

 I

 Act first scene first A study Of a kind
 Half cell half salon opulent yet grave
 Rare books lowshelved yet far above the mind
 Of common man to compass or to crave
 Some slight relief of pamphlets that inclined
 The soul at first to trifling till dismayed
 By text and title it drew back resigned
 Nor cared with levity to vex a shade
 That to itself such perfect concord made

 II

 Some thoughts like these perplexed the patriot brain
 Of Jones Lawgiver to the Commonwealth
 As on the threshold of this chaste domain
 He paused expectant and looked up in stealth
 To darkened canvases that frowned amain
 With sterneyed Puritans who first began
 To spread their roots in Georgius Primus reign
 Nor dropped till now obedient to some plan
 Their century fruitthe perfect Boston man

 III

 Somewhere within that Russiascented gloom
 A voice catarrhal thrilled the Members ear
 Brief is our business Jones Look round this room
 Regard yon portraits Read their meaning clear
 These much proclaim MY station I presume
 YOU are our Congressman before whose wit
 And sober judgment shall the youth appear
 Who for West Point is deemed most just and fit
 To serve his country and to honor it

 IV

 Such is my son Elsewhere perhaps twere wise
 Trial competitive should guide your choice
 There are some people I can well surmise
 Themselves must show their merits Historys voice
 Spares me that trouble all desert that lies
 In yonder ancestor of Queen Annes day
 Or yon grave Governor is all my boys
 Reverts to him entailed as one might say
 In brief result in Winthrop Adams Grey

 V

 He turned and laid his wellbred hand and smiled
 On the cropped head of one who stood beside
 Ah me in sooth it was no ruddy child
 Nor brawny youth that thrilled the fathers pride
 Twas but a Mind that somehow had beguiled
 From soulless Matter processes that served
 For speech and motion and digestion mild
 Content if all one moral purpose nerved
 Nor recked thereby its spine were somewhat curved

 VI

 He was scarce eighteen Yet ere he was eight
 He had despoiled the classics much he knew
 Of Sanskrit not that he placed undue weight
 On this but that it helped him with Hebrew
 His favorite tongue He learned alas too late
 One cant begin too earlywould regret
 That boyish whim to ascertain the state
 Of Venus atmosphere made him forget
 That philologic goal on which his soul was set

 VII

 He too had traveled at the age of ten
 Found Paris empty dull except for art
 And accent Mabille with its glories then
 Less than Egyptian Almees touched a heart
 Nothing if not pure classic If some men
 Thought him a prig it vexed not his conceit
 But moved his pity and ofttimes his pen
 The better to instruct them through some sheet
 Published in Boston and signed Beacon Street

 VIII

 From premises so plain the blind could see
 But one deduction and it came next day
 In times like these the very name of G
 Speaks volumes wrote the Honorable J
 Inclosed please find appointment Presently
 Came a reception to which Harvard lent
 Fourteen professors and to give esprit
 The Liberal Club some eighteen ladies sent
 Five that spoke Greek and thirteen sentiment

 IX

 Four poets came who loved each others song
 And two philosophers who thought that they
 Were in most things impractical and wrong
 And two reformers each in his own way
 Peculiarone who had waxed strong
 On herbs and water and such simple fare
 Two foreign lions Ram See and Chy Long
 And several artists claimed attention there
 Based on the fact they had been snubbed elsewhere

 X

 With this indorsement nothing now remained
 But counsel Godspeed and some calm adieux
 No foolish tear the fathers eyelash stained
 And Winthrops cheek as guiltless shone of dew
 A slight publicity such as obtained
 In classic Rome these few last hours attended
 The day arrived the train and depot gained
 The mayors own presence this last act commended
 The train moved off and here the first act ended

 CANTO II

 I

 Where West Point crouches and with lifted shield
 Turns the whole river eastward through the pass
 Whose jutting crags half silver stand revealed
 Like bossy bucklers of Leonidas
 Where buttressed low against the storms that wield
 Their summer lightnings where her eaglets swarm
 By Freedoms cradle Natures self has steeled
 Her heart like Winkelried and to that storm
 Of leveled lances bares her bosom warm

 II

 But not tonight The air and woods are still
 The faintest rustle in the trees below
 The lowest tremor from the mountain rill
 Come to the ear as but the trailing flow
 Of spirit robes that walk unseen the hill
 The moon low sailing oer the upland farm
 The moon low sailing where the waters fill
 The lozenge lake beside the banks of balm
 Gleams like a chevron on the rivers arm

 III

 All space breathes languor from the hilltop high
 Where Putnams bastion crumbles in the past
 To swooning depths where drowsy cannon lie
 And widemouthed mortars gape in slumbers vast
 Stroke upon stroke the far oars glance and die
 On the hushed bosom of the sleeping stream
 Bright for one moment drifts a white sail by
 Bright for one moment shows a bayonet gleam
 Far on the level plain then passes as a dream

 IV

 Soft down the line of darkened battlements
 Bright on each lattice of the barrack walls
 Where the low arching sallyport indents
 Seen through its gloom beyond the moonbeam falls
 All is repose save where the camping tents
 Mock the white gravestones farther on where sound
 No morning guns for reveille nor whence
 No drumbeat calls retreat but still is ever found
 Waiting and present on each sentrys round

 V

 Within the camp they lie the young the brave
 Half knight half schoolboy acolytes of fame
 Pledged to one altar and perchance one grave
 Bred to fear nothing but reproach and blame
 Ascetic dandies oer whom vestals rave
 Cleanlimbed young Spartans disciplined young elves
 Taught to destroy that they may live to save
 Students embattled soldiers at their shelves
 Heroes whose conquests are at first themselves

 VI

 Within the camp they lie in dreams are freed
 From the grim discipline they learn to love
 In dreams no more the sentrys challenge heed
 In dreams afar beyond their pickets rove
 One treads once more the piny paths that lead
 To his green mountain home and pausing hears
 The cattle call one treads the tangled weed
 Of slippery rocks beside Atlantic piers
 One smiles in sleep one wakens wet with tears

 VII

 One scents the breath of jasmine flowers that twine
 The pillared porches of his Southern home
 One hears the coo of pigeons in the pine
 Of Western woods where he was wont to roam
 One sees the sunset fire the distant line
 Where the long prairie sweeps its levels down
 One treads the snowpeaks one by lamps that shine
 Down the broad highways of the seagirt town
 And two are missingCadets Grey and Brown

 VIII

 Much as I grieve to chronicle the fact
 That selfsame truant known as Cadet Grey
 Was the young hero of our moral tract
 Shorn of his twofold names on entranceday
 Winthrop and Adams dropped in that one act
 Of martial curtness and the rollcall thinned
 Of his ancestors he with youthful tact
 Indulgence claimed since Winthrop no more sinned
 Nor sainted Adams winced when he plain Grey was skinned


 IX

 He had known trials since we saw him last
 By sheer good luck had just escaped rejection
 Not for his learning but that it was cast
 In a spare frame scarce fit for drill inspection
 But when he oped his lips a stream so vast
 Of information flooded each professor
 They quite forgot his eyeglasssomething past
 All precedentaccepting the transgressor
 Weak eyes and all of which he was possessor

 X

 Een the first day he touched a blackboards space
 So the tradition of his glory lingers
 Two wise professors fainted each with face
 White as the chalk within his rapid fingers
 All day he ciphered at such frantic pace
 His form was hid in chalk precipitation
 Of every problem till they said his case
 Could meet from them no fair examination
 Till Congress made a new appropriation

 XI

 Famous in molecules he demonstrated
 From the mess hash to many a listening classful
 Great as a botanist he separated
 Three kinds of Mentha in one juleps glassful
 High in astronomy it has been stated
 He was the first at West Point to discover
 Mars missing satellites and calculated
 Their true positions not the heavens over
 But neath the window of Miss Kitty Rover

 XII

 Indeed I fear this novelty celestial
 That very night was visible and clear
 At least two youths of aspect most terrestrial
 And clad in uniform were loitering near
 A villas casement where a gentle vestal
 Took their impatience somewhat patiently
 Knowing the youths were somewhat green and bestial
 A certain slang of the Academy
 I beg the reader wont refer to me

 XIII

 For when they ceased their ardent strain Miss Kitty
 Glowed not with anger nor a kindred flame
 But rather flushed with an odd sort of pity
 Half matrons kindness and half coquettes shame
 Proud yet quite blameful when she heard their ditty
 She gave her soul poetical expression
 And being clever too as she was pretty
 From her high casement warbled this confession
 Half provocation and one half repression


 NOT YET

 Not yet O friend not yet the patient stars
 Lean from their lattices content to wait
 All is illusion till the morning bars
 Slip from the levels of the Eastern gate
 Night is too young O friend day is too near
 Wait for the day that maketh all things clear
 Not yet O friend not yet

 Not yet O love not yet all is not true
 All is not ever as it seemeth now
 Soon shall the river take another blue
 Soon dies yon light upon the mountain brow
 What lieth dark O love bright day will fill
 Wait for thy morning be it good or ill
 Not yet O love not yet


 XIV

 The strain was finished softly as the night
 Her voice died from the window yet een then
 Fluttered and fell likewise a kerchief white
 But that no doubt was accident for when
 She sought her couch she deemed her conduct quite
 Beyond the reach of scandalous commenter
 Washing her hands of either gallant wight
 Knowing the moralist might compliment her
 Thus voicing Siren with the words of Mentor

 XV

 She little knew the youths below who straight
 Dived for her kerchief and quite overlooked
 The pregnant moral she would inculcate
 Nor dreamed the less how little Winthrop brooked
 Her right to doubt his souls maturer state
 Brownwho was Western amiable and new
 Might take the moral and accept his fate
 The which he did but being stronger too
 Took the white kerchief also as his due

 XVI

 They did not quarrel which no doubt seemed queer
 To those who knew not how their friendship blended
 Each was opposed and each the others peer
 Yet each the other in some things transcended
 Where Brown lacked culture brainsand oft I fear
 Cash in his pocketGrey of course supplied him
 Where Grey lacked frankness force and faith sincere
 Brown of his manhood suffered none to chide him
 But in his faults stood manfully beside him

 XVII

 In academic walks and studies grave
 In the camp drill and martial occupation
 They helped each other but just here I crave
 Space for the readers full imagination
 The fact is patent Grey became a slave
 A tool a fag a pleb To state it plainer
 All that blue blood and ancestry eer gave
 Cleaned guns brought waterwas in fact retainer
 To Jones whose uncle was a paperstainer

 XVIII

 How they bore this at home I cannot say
 I only know so runs the gossips tale
 It chanced one day that the paternal Grey
 Came to West Point that he himself might hail
 The future hero in some proper way
 Consistent with his lineage With him came
 A judge a poet and a brave array
 Of aunts and uncles bearing each a name
 Eyeglass and respirator with the same

 XIX

 Observe quoth Grey the elder to his friends
 Not in these giddy youths at baseball playing
 Youll notice Winthrop Adams Greater ends
 Than these absorb HIS leisure No doubt straying
 With Caesars Commentaries he attends
 Some Roman council Let us ask however
 Yon grimy urchin who my soul offends
 By wheeling offal if he will endeavor
 To find What heaven Winthrop Oh no never

 XX

 Alas too true The last of all the Greys
 Was doing police detailit had come
 To this in vain the rare historic bays
 That crowned the pictured Puritans at home
 And yet twas certain that in grosser ways
 Of health and physique he was quite improving
 Straighter he stood and had achieved some praise
 In other exercise much more behooving
 A soldiers taste than merely dirt removing

 XXI

 But to resume we left the youthful pair
 Some stanzas back before a ladys bower
 Tis to be hoped they were no longer there
 For stars were pointing to the morning hour
 Their escapade discovered ill twould fare
 With our two heroes derelict of orders
 But like the ghost they scent the morning air
 And back again they steal across the borders
 Unseen unheeded by their martial warders

 XXII

 They got to bed with speed young Grey to dream
 Of some vague future with a generals star
 And Mistress Kitty basking in its gleam
 While Brown content to worship her afar
 Dreamed himself dying by some lonely stream
 Having snatched Kitty from eighteen Nez Perces
 Till a far bugle with the morning beam
 In his dull ear its fateful song rehearses
 Which Winthrop Adams after put to verses

 XXIII

 So passed three years of their novitiate
 The first real boyhood Grey had ever known
 His youth ran clearnot choked like his Cochituate
 In civic pipes but free and pure alone
 Yet knew repression could himself habituate
 To having mind and body well rubbed down
 Could read himself in others and could situate
 Themselves in himexcept I grieve to own
 He couldnt see what Kitty saw in Brown

 XXIV

 At last came graduation Brown received
 In the One Hundredth Cavalry commission
 Then frolic flirting partingwhen none grieved
 Save Brown who loved our young Academician
 And Grey who felt his friend was still deceived
 By Mistress Kitty who with other beauties
 Graced the occasion and it was believed
 Had promised Brown that when he could recruit his
 Promised command shed share with him those duties

 XXV

 Howeer this was I know not all I know
 The night was Junes the moon rode high and clear
 Twas such a night as this three years ago
 Miss Kitty sang the song that two might hear
 There is a walk where trees oerarching grow
 Too wide for one not wide enough for three
 A fact precluding any plural beau
 Which quite explained Miss Kittys company
 But not why Grey that favored one should be

 XXVI

 There is a spring whose limpid waters hide
 Somewhere within the shadows of that path
 Called Kosciuskos There two figures bide
 Grey and Miss Kitty Surely Nature hath
 No fairer mirror for a mightbe bride
 Than this same pool that caught our gentle belle
 To its dark heart one moment At her side
 Grey bent A something trembled oer the well
 Bright sphericala tear Ah no a button fell

 XXVII

 Material minds might think that gravitation
 Quoth Grey drew yon metallic spheroid down
 The soul poetic views the situation
 Fraught with more meaning When thy girlish crown
 Was mirrored there there was disintegration
 Of me and all my spirit moved to you
 Taking the form of slow precipitation
 But here came Taps a start a smile adieu
 A blush a sigh and end of Canto II

 BUGLE SONG

 Fades the light
 And afar
 Goeth day cometh night
 And a star
 Leadeth all
 Speedeth all
 To their rest

 Love goodnight
 Must thou go
 When the day
 And the light
 Need thee so
 Needeth all
 Heedeth all
 That is best

 CANTO III

 I

 Where the sun sinks through leagues of arid sky
 Where the sun dies oer leagues of arid plain
 Where the dead bones of wasted rivers lie
 Trailed from their channels in yon mountain chain
 Where day by day naught takes the wearied eye
 But the lowrimming mountains sharply based
 On the dead levels moving far or nigh
 As the sick vision wanders oer the waste
 But ever day by day against the sunset traced

 II

 There moving through a poisonous cloud that stings
 With dust of alkali the trampling band
 Of Indian ponies ride on dusky wings
 The red marauders of the Western land
 Heavy with spoil they seek the trail that brings
 Their flaunting lances to that sheltered bank
 Where lie their lodges and the river sings
 Forgetful of the plain beyond that drank
 Its life blood where the wasted caravan sank

 III

 They brought with them the thiefs ignoble spoil
 The beggars dole the greed of chiffonnier
 The scum of camps the implements of toil
 Snatched from dead hands to rust as useless here
 All they could rake or glean from hut or soil
 Piled their lean ponies with the jackdaws greed
 For vacant glitter It were scarce a foil
 To all this tinsel that one feathered reed
 Bore on its barb two scalps that freshly bleed

 IV

 They brought with them alas a wounded foe
 Bound hand and foot yet nursed with cruel care
 Lest that in death he might escape one throe
 They had decreed his living flesh should bear
 A youthful officer by one foul blow
 Of treachery surprised yet fighting still
 Amid his ambushed train calm as the snow
 Above him hopeless yet content to spill
 His blood with theirs and fighting but to kill

 V

 He had fought nobly and in that brief spell
 Had won the awe of those rude border men
 Who gathered round him and beside him fell
 In loyal faith and silence save that when
 By smoke embarrassed and near sight as well
 He paused to wipe his eyeglass and decide
 Its nearer focus there arose a yell
 Of approbation and Bob Barker cried
 Wade in Dundreary tossed his cap anddied

 VI

 Their sole survivor now his captors bear
 Him all unconscious and beside the stream
 Leave him to rest meantime the squaws prepare
 The stake for sacrifice nor wakes a gleam
 Of pity in those Furies eyes that glare
 Expectant of the torture yet alway
 His steadfast spirit shines and mocks them there
 With peace they know not till at close of day
 On his dull ear there thrills a whispered Grey

 VII

 He starts Was it a trick Had angels kind
 Touched with compassion some weak womans breast
 Such things hed read of Faintly to his mind
 Came Pocahontas pleading for her guest
 But then this voice though soft was still inclined
 To baritone A squaw in ragged gown
 Stood near him frowning hatred Was he blind
 Whose eye was this beneath that beetling frown
 The frown was painted but that wink meantBrown

 VIII

 Hush for your life and mine the thongs are cut
 He whispers in yon thicket stands my horse
 One dashI follow close as if to glut
 My own revenge yet bar the others course
 Now And tis done Grey speeds Brown follows but
 Ere yet they reach the shade Grey fainting reels
 Yet not before Browns circling arms close shut
 His in uplifting him Anon he feels
 A horse beneath him bound and hears the rattling heels

 IX

 Then rose a yell of baffled hate and sprang
 Headlong the savages in swift pursuit
 Though speed the fugitives they hope to hang
 Hot on their heels like wolves with tireless foot
 Long is the chase Brown hears with inward pang
 The short hard panting of his gallant steed
 Beneath its double burden vainly rang
 Both voice and spur The heaving flanks may bleed
 Yet comes the sequel that they still must heed

 X

 Brown saw itreined his steed dismounting stood
 Calm and inflexible Old chap you see
 There is but ONE escape You know it Good
 There is ONE man to take it You are he
 The horse wont carry double If he could
 Twould but protract this bother I shall stay
 Ive business with these devils they with me
 I will occupy them till you get away
 Hush quick time forward There God bless you Grey

 XI

 But as he finished Grey slipped to his feet
 Calm as his ancestors in voice and eye
 You do forget yourself when you compete
 With him whose RIGHT it is to stay and die
 Thats not YOUR duty Please regain your seat
 And take my ORDERSsince I rank you here
 Mount and rejoin your men and my defeat
 Report at quarters Take this letter neer
 Give it to aught but HER nor let aught interfere

 XII

 And shamed and blushing Brown the letter took
 Obediently and placed it in his pocket
 Then drawing forth another said I look
 For death as you do wherefore take this locket
 And letter Here his comrades hand he shook
 In silence Should we both together fall
 Some other manbut here all speech forsook
 His lips as ringing cheerily oer all
 He heard afar his own dear buglecall

 XIII

 Twas his command and succor but een then
 Grey fainted with poor Brown who had forgot
 He likewise had been wounded and both men
 Were picked up quite unconscious of their lot
 Long lay they in extremity and when
 They both grew stronger and once more exchanged
 Old vows and memories one common den
 In hospital was theirs and free they ranged
 Awaiting orders but no more estranged

 XIV

 And yet twas strangenor can I end my tale
 Without this moral to be fair and just
 They never sought to know why each did fail
 The prompt fulfillment of the others trust
 It was suggested they could not avail
 Themselves of either letter since they were
 Duly dispatched to their address by mail
 By Captain X who knew Miss Rover fair
 Now meant stout Mistress Bloggs of Blank Blank Square





II SPANISH IDYLS AND LEGENDS




THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO

 This is the tale that the Chronicle
 Tells of the wonderful miracle
 Wrought by the pious Padre Serro
 The very reverend Junipero

 The heathen stood on his ancient mound
 Looking over the desert bound
 Into the distant hazy South
 Over the dusty and broad champaign
 Where with many a gaping mouth
 And fissure cracked by the fervid drouth
 For seven months had the wasted plain
 Known no moisture of dew or rain
 The wells were empty and choked with sand
 The rivers had perished from the land
 Only the seafogs to and fro
 Slipped like ghosts of the streams below
 Deep in its bed lay the rivers bones
 Bleaching in pebbles and milkwhite stones
 And tracked oer the desert faint and far
 Its ribs shone bright on each sandy bar

 Thus they stood as the sun went down
 Over the foothills bare and brown
 Thus they looked to the South wherefrom
 The paleface medicineman should come
 Not in anger or in strife
 But to bringso ran the tale
 The welcome springs of eternal life
 The living waters that should not fail

 Said one He will come like Manitou
 Unseen unheard in the falling dew
 Said another He will come full soon
 Out of the roundfaced watery moon
 And another said He is here and lo
 Faltering staggering feeble and slow
 Out from the deserts blinding heat
 The Padre dropped at the heathens feet

 They stood and gazed for a little space
 Down on his pallid and careworn face
 And a smile of scorn went round the band
 As they touched alternate with foot and hand
 This mortal waif that the outer space
 Of dim mysterious sky and sand
 Flung with so little of Christian grace
 Down on their barren sterile strand

 Said one to him It seems thy God
 Is a very pitiful kind of God
 He could not shield thine aching eyes
 From the blowing desert sands that rise
 Nor turn aside from thy old gray head
 The glittering blade that is brandished
 By the sun He set in the heavens high
 He could not moisten thy lips when dry
 The desert fire is in thy brain
 Thy limbs are racked with the feverpain
 If this be the grace He showeth thee
 Who art His servant what may we
 Strange to His ways and His commands
 Seek at His unforgiving hands

 Drink but this cup said the Padre straight
 And thou shalt know whose mercy bore
 These aching limbs to your heathen door
 And purged my soul of its gross estate
 Drink in His name and thou shalt see
 The hidden depths of this mystery
 Drink and he held the cup One blow
 From the heathen dashed to the ground below
 The sacred cup that the Padre bore
 And the thirsty soil drank the precious store
 Of sacramental and holy wine
 That emblem and consecrated sign
 And blessed symbol of blood divine

 Then says the legend and they who doubt
 The same as heretics be accurst
 From the dry and feverish soil leaped out
 A living fountain a wellspring burst
 Over the dusty and broad champaign
 Over the sandy and sterile plain
 Till the granite ribs and the milkwhite stones
 That lay in the valleythe scattered bones
 Moved in the river and lived again

 Such was the wonderful miracle
 Wrought by the cup of wine that fell
 From the hands of the pious Padre Serro
 The very reverend Junipero




THE WONDERFUL SPRING OF SAN JOAQUIN

 Of all the fountains that poets sing
 Crystal thermal or mineral spring
 Ponce de Leons Fount of Youth
 Wells with bottoms of doubtful truth
 In short of all the springs of Time
 That ever were flowing in fact or rhyme
 That ever were tasted felt or seen
 There were none like the Spring of San Joaquin

 Anno Domini eighteenseven
 Father Dominguez now in heaven
 Obiit eighteen twentyseven
 Found the spring and found it too
 By his mules miraculous cast of a shoe
 For his beasta descendant of Balaams ass
 Stopped on the instant and would not pass

 The Padre thought the omen good
 And bent his lips to the trickling flood
 Thenas the Chronicles declare
 On the honest faith of a true believer
 His cheeks though wasted lank and bare
 Filled like a withered russet pear
 In the vacuum of a glass receiver
 And the snows that seventy winters bring
 Melted away in that magic spring

 Such at least was the wondrous news
 The Padre brought into Santa Cruz
 The Church of course had its own views
 Of who were worthiest to use
 The magic spring but the prior claim
 Fell to the aged sick and lame
 Far and wide the people came
 Some from the healthful Aptos Creek
 Hastened to bring their helpless sick
 Even the fishers of rude Soquel
 Suddenly found they were far from well
 The brawny dwellers of San Lorenzo
 Said in fact they had never been so
 And all were ailingstrange to say
 From Pescadero to Monterey

 Over the mountain they poured in
 With leathern bottles and bags of skin
 Through the canyons a motley throng
 Trotted hobbled and limped along
 The Fathers gazed at the moving scene
 With pious joy and with souls serene
 And thena result perhaps foreseen
 They laid out the Mission of San Joaquin

 Not in the eyes of faith alone
 The good effects of the water shone
 But skins grew rosy eyes waxed clear
 Of rough vaquero and muleteer
 Angular forms were rounded out
 Limbs grew supple and waists grew stout
 And as for the girlsfor miles about
 They had no equal To this day
 From Pescadero to Monterey
 Youll still find eyes in which are seen
 The liquid graces of San Joaquin

 There is a limit to human bliss
 And the Mission of San Joaquin had this
 None went abroad to roam or stay
 But they fell sick in the queerest way
 A singular maladie du pays
 With gastric symptoms so they spent
 Their days in a sensuous content
 Caring little for things unseen
 Beyond their bowers of living green
 Beyond the mountains that lay between
 The world and the Mission of San Joaquin

 Winter passed and the summer came
 The trunks of madrono all aflame
 Here and there through the underwood
 Like pillars of fire starkly stood
 All of the breezy solitude
 Was filled with the spicing of pine and bay
 And resinous odors mixed and blended
 And dim and ghostlike far away
 The smoke of the burning woods ascended
 Then of a sudden the mountains swam
 The rivers piled their floods in a dam
 The ridge above Los Gatos Creek
 Arched its spine in a feline fashion
 The forests waltzed till they grew sick
 And Nature shook in a speechless passion
 And swallowed up in the earthquakes spleen
 The wonderful Spring of San Joaquin
 Vanished and never more was seen

 Two days passed the Mission folk
 Out of their rosy dream awoke
 Some of them looked a trifle white
 But that no doubt was from earthquake fright
 Three days there was sore distress
 Headache nausea giddiness
 Four days faintings tenderness
 Of the mouth and fauces and in less
 Than one weekhere the story closes
 We wont continue the prognosis
 Enough that now no trace is seen
 Of Spring or Mission of San Joaquin

 MORAL

 You see the point Dont be too quick
 To break bad habits better stick
 Like the Mission folk to your ARSENIC




THE ANGELUS

 HEARD AT THE MISSION DOLORES 1868

 Bells of the Past whose longforgotten music
 Still fills the wide expanse
 Tingeing the sober twilight of the Present
 With color of romance

 I hear your call and see the sun descending
 On rock and wave and sand
 As down the coast the Mission voices blending
 Girdle the heathen land

 Within the circle of your incantation
 No blight nor mildew falls
 Nor fierce unrest nor lust nor low ambition
 Passes those airy walls

 Borne on the swell of your long waves receding
 I touch the farther Past
 I see the dying glow of Spanish glory
 The sunset dream and last

 Before me rise the domeshaped Mission towers
 The white Presidio
 The swart commander in his leathern jerkin
 The priest in stole of snow

 Once more I see Portalas cross uplifting
 Above the setting sun
 And past the headland northward slowly drifting
 The freighted galleon

 O solemn bells whose consecrated masses
 Recall the faith of old
 O tinkling bells that lulled with twilight music
 The spiritual fold

 Your voices break and falter in the darkness
 Break falter and are still
 And veiled and mystic like the Host descending
 The sun sinks from the hill




CONCEPCION DE ARGUELLO

 PRESIDIO DE SAN FRANCISCO 1800

 I

 Looking seaward oer the sandhills stands the fortress old and
 quaint
 By the San Francisco friars lifted to their patron saint

 Sponsor to that wondrous city now apostate to the creed
 On whose youthful walls the Padre saw the angels golden reed

 All its trophies long since scattered all its blazon brushed away
 And the flag that flies above it but a triumph of today

 Never scar of siege or battle challenges the wandering eye
 Never breach of warlike onset holds the curious passerby

 Only one sweet human fancy interweaves its threads of gold
 With the plain and homespun present and a love that neer grows old

 Only one thing holds its crumbling walls above the meaner dust
 Listen to the simple story of a womans love and trust

 II

 Count von Resanoff the Russian envoy of the mighty Czar
 Stood beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are

 He with grave provincial magnates long had held serene debate
 On the Treaty of Alliance and the high affairs of state

 He from grave provincial magnates oft had turned to talk apart
 With the Commandantes daughter on the questions of the heart

 Until points of gravest import yielded slowly one by one
 And by Love was consummated what Diplomacy begun

 Till beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are
 He received the twofold contract for approval of the Czar

 Till beside the brazen cannon the betrothed bade adieu
 And from sallyport and gateway north the Russian eagles flew

 III

 Long beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are
 Did they wait the promised bridegroom and the answer of the Czar

 Day by day on wall and bastion beat the hollow empty breeze
 Day by day the sunlight glittered on the vacant smiling seas

 Week by week the near hills whitened in their dusty leather cloaks
 Week by week the far hills darkened from the fringing plain of oaks

 Till the rains came and far breaking on the fierce southwester tost
 Dashed the whole long coast with color and then vanished and were
 lost

 So each year the seasons shiftedwet and warm and drear and dry
 Half a year of clouds and flowers half a year of dust and sky

 Still it brought no ship nor messagebrought no tidings ill or meet
 For the statesmanlike Commander for the daughter fair and sweet

 Yet she heard the varying message voiceless to all ears beside
 He will come the flowers whispered Come no more the dry hills
 sighed

 Still she found him with the waters lifted by the morning breeze
 Still she lost him with the folding of the great whitetented seas

 Until hollows chased the dimples from her cheeks of olive brown
 And at times a swift shy moisture dragged the long sweet lashes down

 Or the small mouth curved and quivered as for some denied caress
 And the fair young brow was knitted in an infantine distress

 Then the grim Commander pacing where the brazen cannon are
 Comforted the maid with proverbs wisdom gathered from afar

 Bits of ancient observation by his fathers garnered each
 As a pebble worn and polished in the current of his speech

 Those who wait the coming rider travel twice as far as he
 Tired wench and coming butter never did in time agree

 He that getteth himself honey though a clown he shall have flies
 In the end God grinds the miller In the dark the mole has eyes

 He whose father is Alcalde of his trial hath no fear
 And be sure the Count has reasons that will make his conduct clear

 Then the voice sententious faltered and the wisdom it would teach
 Lost itself in fondest trifles of his soft Castilian speech

 And on Concha Conchitita and Conchita he would dwell
 With the fond reiteration which the Spaniard knows so well

 So with proverbs and caresses half in faith and half in doubt
 Every day some hope was kindled flickered faded and went out

 IV

 Yearly down the hillside sweeping came the stately cavalcade
 Bringing revel to vaquero joy and comfort to each maid

 Bringing days of formal visit social feast and rustic sport
 Of bullbaiting on the plaza of lovemaking in the court

 Vainly then at Conchas lattice vainly as the idle wind
 Rose the thin high Spanish tenor that bespoke the youth too kind

 Vainly leaning from their saddles caballeros bold and fleet
 Plucked for her the buried chicken from beneath their mustangs feet

 So in vain the barren hillsides with their gay serapes blazed
 Blazed and vanished in the dustcloud that their flying hoofs had
 raised

 Then the drum called from the rampart and once more with patient
 mien
 The Commander and his daughter each took up the dull routine

 Each took up the petty duties of a life apart and lone
 Till the slow years wrought a music in its dreary monotone

 V

 Forty years on wall and bastion swept the hollow idle breeze
 Since the Russian eagle fluttered from the California seas

 Forty years on wall and bastion wrought its slow but sure decay
 And St Georges cross was lifted in the port of Monterey

 And the citadel was lighted and the hall was gayly drest
 All to honor Sir George Simpson famous traveler and guest

 Far and near the people gathered to the costly banquet set
 And exchanged congratulations with the English baronet

 Till the formal speeches ended and amidst the laugh and wine
 Some one spoke of Conchas loverheedless of the warning sign

 Quickly then cried Sir George Simpson Speak no ill of him I pray
 He is dead He died poor fellow forty years ago this day

 Died while speeding home to Russia falling from a fractious horse
 Left a sweetheart too they tell me Married I suppose of course

 Lives she yet A deathlike silence fell on banquet guests and
 hall
 And a trembling figure rising fixed the awestruck gaze of all

 Two black eyes in darkened orbits gleamed beneath the nuns white hood
 Black serge hid the wasted figure bowed and stricken where it stood

 Lives she yet Sir George repeated All were hushed as Concha drew
 Closer yet her nuns attire Senor pardon she died too




FOR THE KING

 NORTHERN MEXICO 1640

 As you look from the plaza at Leon west
 You can see her house but the view is best
 From the porch of the church where she lies at rest

 Where much of her past still lives I think
 In the scowling brows and sidelong blink
 Of the worshiping throng that rise or sink

 To the waxen saints that yellow and lank
 Lean out from their niches rank on rank
 With a bloodless Saviour on either flank

 In the gouty pillars whose cracks begin
 To show the adobe core within
 A soul of earth in a whitewashed skin

 And I think that the moral of all youll say
 Is the sculptured legend that moulds away
 On a tomb in the choir Por el Rey

 Por el Rey Well the king is gone
 Ages ago and the Hapsburg one
 Shotbut the Rock of the Church lives on

 Por el Rey What matters indeed
 If king or president succeed
 To a country haggard with sloth and greed

 As long as one granary is fat
 And yonder priest in a shovel hat
 Peeps out from the bin like a sleek brown rat

 What matters Naught if it serves to bring
 The legend nearerno other thing
 Well spare the moral Live the king

 Two hundred years ago they say
 The Viceroy Marquis of MonteRey
 Rode with his retinue that way

 Grave as befitted Spains grandee
 Grave as the substitute should be
 Of His Most Catholic Majesty

 Yet from his black plumes curving grace
 To his slim black gauntlets smaller space
 Exquisite as a piece of lace

 Two hundred years agoeen so
 The Marquis stopped where the limetrees blow
 While Leons seneschal bent him low

 And begged that the Marquis would that night take
 His humble roof for the royal sake
 And then as the custom demanded spake

 The usual wish that his guest would hold
 The house and all that it might enfold
 As hiswith the bride scarce three days old

 Be sure that the Marquis in his place
 Replied to all with the measured grace
 Of chosen speech and unmoved face

 Nor raised his head till his black plume swept
 The hem of the ladys robe who kept
 Her place as her husband backward stept

 And then I know not how nor why
 A subtle flame in the ladys eye
 Unseen by the courtiers standing by

 Burned through his lace and titled wreath
 Burned through his bodys jeweled sheath
 Till it touched the steel of the man beneath

 And yet mayhap no more was meant
 Than to point a wellworn compliment
 And the ladys beauty her worst intent

 Howbeit the Marquis bowed again
 Who rules with awe well serveth Spain
 But best whose law is love made plain

 Be sure that night no pillow prest
 The seneschal but with the rest
 Watched as was due a royal guest

 Watched from the wall till he saw the square
 Fill with the moonlight white and bare
 Watched till he saw two shadows fare

 Out from his garden where the shade
 That the old church tower and belfry made
 Like a benedictory hand was laid

 Few words spoke the seneschal as he turned
 To his nearest sentry These monks have learned
 That stolen fruit is sweetly earned

 Myself shall punish yon acolyte
 Who gathers my garden grapes by night
 Meanwhile wait thou till the morning light

 Yet not till the sun was riding high
 Did the sentry meet his commanders eye
 Nor then till the Viceroy stood by

 To the lovers of grave formalities
 No greeting was ever so fine I wis
 As this hosts and guests high courtesies

 The seneschal feared as the wind was west
 A blast from Morena had chilled his rest
 The Viceroy languidly confest

 That cares of state andhe dared to say
 Some fears that the King could not repay
 The thoughtful zeal of his host some way

 Had marred his rest Yet he trusted much
 None shared his wakefulness though such
 Indeed might be If he dared to touch

 A theme so finethe bride perchance
 Still slept At least they missed her glance
 To give this greeting countenance

 Be sure that the seneschal in turn
 Was deeply bowed with the grave concern
 Of the painful news his guest should learn

 Last night to her fathers dying bed
 By a priest was the lady summoned
 Nor know we yet how well she sped

 But hope for the best The grave Viceroy
 Though grieved his visit had such alloy
 Must still wish the seneschal great joy

 Of a bride so true to her filial trust
 Yet now as the day waxed on they must
 To horse if theyd scape the noonday dust

 Nay said the seneschal at least
 To mend the news of this funeral priest
 Myself shall ride as your escort east

 The Viceroy bowed Then turned aside
 To his nearest follower With me ride
 You and Felipeon either side

 And list Should anything me befall
 Mischance of ambush or musketball
 Cleave to his saddle yon seneschal

 No more Then gravely in accents clear
 Took formal leave of his late good cheer
 Whiles the seneschal whispered a musketeer

 Carelessly stroking his pommel top
 If from the saddle ye see me drop
 Riddle me quickly yon solemn fop

 So these with many a compliment
 Each on his own dark thought intent
 With grave politeness onward went

 Riding high and in sight of all
 Viceroy escort and seneschal
 Under the shade of the Almandral

 Holding their secret hard and fast
 Silent and grave they ride at last
 Into the dusty traveled Past

 Even like this they passed away
 Two hundred years ago today
 What of the lady Who shall say

 Do the souls of the dying ever yearn
 To some favored spot for the dusts return
 For the homely peace of the family urn

 I know not Yet did the seneschal
 Chancing in afteryears to fall
 Pierced by a Flemish musketball

 Call to his side a trusty friar
 And bid him swear as his last desire
 To bear his corse to San Pedros choir

 At Leon where neath a shield azure
 Should his mortal frame find sepulture
 This much for the pains Christ did endure

 Be sure that the friar loyally
 Fulfilled his trust by land and sea
 Till the spires of Leon silently

 Rose through the green of the Almandral
 As if to beckon the seneschal
 To his kindred dust neath the choir wall

 I wot that the saints on either side
 Leaned from their niches openeyed
 To see the doors of the church swing wide

 That the wounds of the Saviour on either flank
 Bled fresh as the mourners rank by rank
 Went by with the coffin clank on clank

 For why When they raised the marble door
 Of the tomb untouched for years before
 The friar swooned on the choir floor

 For there in her laces and festal dress
 Lay the dead mans wife her loveliness
 Scarcely changed by her long duress

 As on the night she had passed away
 Only that near her a dagger lay
 With the written legend Por el Rey

 What was their greeting the groom and bride
 They whom that steel and the years divide
 I know not Here they lie side by side

 Side by side Though the king has his way
 Even the dead at last have their day
 Make you the moral Por el Rey




RAMON

 REFUGIO MINE NORTHERN MEXICO

 Drunk and senseless in his place
 Prone and sprawling on his face
 More like brute than any man
 Alive or dead
 By his great pump out of gear
 Lay the peon engineer
 Waking only just to hear
 Overhead
 Angry tones that called his name
 Oaths and cries of bitter blame
 Woke to hear all this and waking turned and fled

 To the man wholl bring to me
 Cried Intendant Harry Lee
 Harry Lee the English foreman of the mine
 Bring the sot alive or dead
 I will give to him he said
 Fifteen hundred pesos down
 Just to set the rascals crown
 Underneath this heel of mine
 Since but death
 Deserves the man whose deed
 Be it vice or want of heed
 Stops the pumps that give us breath
 Stops the pumps that suck the death
 From the poisoned lower levels of the mine

 No one answered for a cry
 From the shaft rose up on high
 And shuffling scrambling tumbling from below
 Came the miners each the bolder
 Mounting on the weakers shoulder
 Grappling clinging to their hold or
 Letting go
 As the weaker gasped and fell
 From the ladder to the well
 To the poisoned pit of hell
 Down below

 To the man who sets them free
 Cried the foreman Harry Lee
 Harry Lee the English foreman of the mine
 Brings them out and sets them free
 I will give that man said he
 Twice that sum who with a rope
 Face to face with Death shall cope
 Let him come who dares to hope
 Hold your peace some one replied
 Standing by the foremans side
 There has one already gone whoeer he be

 Then they held their breath with awe
 Pulling on the rope and saw
 Fainting figures reappear
 On the black rope swinging clear
 Fastened by some skillful hand from below
 Till a score the level gained
 And but one alone remained
 He the hero and the last
 He whose skillful hand made fast
 The long line that brought them back to hope and cheer

 Haggard gasping down dropped he
 At the feet of Harry Lee
 Harry Lee the English foreman of the mine
 I have come he gasped to claim
 Both rewards Senor my name
 Is Ramon
 Im the drunken engineer
 Im the coward Senor Here
 He fell over by that sign
 Dead as stone




DON DIEGO OF THE SOUTH

 REFECTORY MISSION SAN GABRIEL 1869

 Goodsaid the Padrebelieve me still
 Don Giovanni or what you will
 The types eternal We knew him here
 As Don Diego del Sud I fear
 The storys no new one Will you hear

 One of those spirits you cant tell why
 God has permitted Therein I
 Have the advantage for I hold
 That wolves are sent to the purest fold
 And wed save the wolf if wed get the lamb
 Youre no believer Good I am

 Well for some purpose I grant you dim
 The Don loved women and they loved him
 Each thought herself his LAST love Worst
 Many believed that they were his FIRST
 And such are these creatures since the Fall
 The very doubt had a charm for all

 You laugh You are young but Iindeed
 I have no patience To proceed
 You saw as you passed through the upper town
 The Eucinal where the road goes down
 To San Felipe There one morn
 They found Diegohis mantle torn
 And as many holes through his doublets band
 As there were wronged husbandsyou understand

 Dying so said the gossips Dead
 Was what the friars who found him said
 May be Quien sabe Who else should know
 It was a hundred years ago
 There was a funeral Small indeed
 Private What would you To proceed

 Scarcely the year had flown One night
 The Commandante awoke in fright
 Hearing below his casements bar
 The wellknown twang of the Dons guitar
 And rushed to the window just to see
 His wife aswoon on the balcony

 One week later Don Juan Ramirez
 Found his own daughter the Dona Inez
 Pale as a ghost leaning out to hear
 The song of that phantom cavalier
 Even Alcalde Pedro Blas
 Saw it was said through his nieces glass
 The shade of Diego twice repass

 What these gentlemen each confessed
 Heaven and the Church only knows At best
 The case was a bad one How to deal
 With Sin as a Ghost they couldnt but feel
 Was an awful thing Till a certain Fray
 Humbly offered to show the way

 And the way was this Did I say before
 That the Fray was a stranger No Senor
 Strange very strange I should have said
 That the very week that the Don lay dead
 He came among us Bread he broke
 Silent nor ever to one he spoke
 So he had vowed it Below his brows
 His face was hidden There are such vows

 Strange are they not You do not use
 Snuff A bad habit

 Well the views
 Of the Fray were these that the penance done
 By the caballeros was right but one
 Was due from the CAUSE and that in brief
 Was Dona Dolores Gomez chief
 And Inez Sanchicha Concepcion
 And Carmenwell half the girls in town
 On his tablets the Friar had written down

 These were to come on a certain day
 And ask at the hands of the pious Fray
 For absolution That done small fear
 But the shade of Diego would disappear

 They came each knelt in her turn and place
 To the pious Fray with his hidden face
 And voiceless lips and each again
 Took back her soul freed from spot or stain
 Till the Dona Inez with eyes downcast
 And a tear on their fringes knelt her last

 And thenperhaps that her voice was low
 From fear or from shamethe monks said so
 But the Fray leaned forward when presto all
 Were thrilled by a scream and saw her fall
 Fainting beside the confessional

 And so was the ghost of Diego laid
 As the Fray had said Never more his shade
 Was seen at San Gabriels Mission Eh
 The girl interests you I dare say
 Nothing said she when they brought her to
 Only a faintness They spoke more true
 Who said twas a stubborn soul But then
 Women are women and men are men

 So to return As I said before
 Having got the wolf by the same high law
 We saved the lamb in the wolfs own jaw
 And thats my moral The tale I fear
 But poorly told Yet it strikes me here
 Is stuff for a moral Whats your view
 You smile Don Pancho Ah thats like you




AT THE HACIENDA

 Know I not whom thou mayst be
 Carved upon this olivetree
 Manuela of La Torre
 For around on broken walls
 Summer sun and spring rain falls
 And in vain the low wind calls
 Manuela of La Torre

 Of that song no words remain
 But the musical refrain
 Manuela of La Torre
 Yet at night when winds are still
 Tinkles on the distant hill
 A guitar and words that thrill
 Tell to me the old old story
 Old when first thy charms were sung
 Old when these old walls were young
 Manuela of La Torre




FRIAR PEDROS RIDE

 It was the morning season of the year
 It was the morning era of the land
 The watercourses rang full loud and clear
 Portalas cross stood where Portalas hand
 Had planted it when Faith was taught by Fear
 When monks and missions held the sole command
 Of all that shore beside the peaceful sea
 Where springtides beat their longdrawn reveille

 Out of the mission of San Luis Rey
 All in that brisk tumultuous spring weather
 Rode Friar Pedro in a pious way
 With six dragoons in cuirasses of leather
 Each armed alike for either prayer or fray
 Handcuffs and missals they had slung together
 And as an aid the gospel truth to scatter
 Each swung a lassoalias a riata

 In sooth that year the harvest had been slack
 The crop of converts scarce worth computation
 Some souls were lost whose owners had turned back
 To save their bodies frequent flagellation
 And some preferred the songs of birds alack
 To Latin matins and their souls salvation
 And thought their own wild whoopings were less dreary
 Than Father Pedros droning miserere

 To bring them back to matins and to prime
 To pious works and secular submission
 To prove to them that liberty was crime
 This was in fact the Padres present mission
 To get new souls perchance at the same time
 And bring them to a sense of their condition
 That easy phrase which in the past and present
 Means making that condition most unpleasant

 He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow
 He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill
 He saw the gopher working in his burrow
 He saw the squirrel scampering at his will
 He saw all this and felt no doubt a thorough
 And deep conviction of Gods goodness still
 He failed to see that in His glory He
 Yet left the humblest of His creatures free

 He saw the flapping crow whose frequent note
 Voiced the monotony of land and sky
 Mocking with graceless wing and rusty coat
 His priestly presence as he trotted by
 He would have cursed the bird by bell and rote
 But other game just then was in his eye
 A savage camp whose occupants preferred
 Their heathen darkness to the living Word

 He rang his bell and at the martial sound
 Twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed
 Six horses sprang across the level ground
 As six dragoons in open order dashed
 Above their heads the lassos circled round
 In every eye a pious fervor flashed
 They charged the camp and in one moment more
 They lassoed six and reconverted four

 The Friar saw the conflict from a knoll
 And sang Laus Deo and cheered on his men
 Well thrown Bautistathats another soul
 After him Gomeztry it once again
 This way Felipethere the heathen stole
 Bones of St Francissurely that makes TEN
 Te Deum laudamusbut theyre very wild
 Non nobis Domineall right my child

 When at that momentas the story goes
 A certain squaw who had her foes eluded
 Ran past the Friar just before his nose
 He stared a moment and in silence brooded
 Then in his breast a pious frenzy rose
 And every other prudent thought excluded
 He caught a lasso and dashed in a canter
 After that Occidental Atalanta

 High oer his head he swirled the dreadful noose
 But as the practice was quite unfamiliar
 His first cast tore Felipes captive loose
 And almost choked Tiburcio Camilla
 And might have interfered with that brave youths
 Ability to gorge the tough tortilla
 But all things come by practice and at last
 His flying slipknot caught the maiden fast

 Then rose above the plain a mingled yell
 Of rage and triumpha demoniac whoop
 The Padre heard it like a passing knell
 And would have loosened his unchristian loop
 But the tough rawhide held the captive well
 And held alas too well the captordupe
 For with one bound the savage fled amain
 Dragging horse Friar down the lonely plain

 Down the arroyo out across the mead
 By heath and hollow sped the flying maid
 Dragging behind her still the panting steed
 And helpless Friar who in vain essayed
 To cut the lasso or to check his speed
 He felt himself beyond all human aid
 And trusted to the saintsand for that matter
 To some weak spot in Felipes riata

 Alas the lasso had been duly blessed
 And like baptism held the flying wretch
 A doctrine that the priest had oft expressed
 Which like the lasso might be made to stretch
 But would not break so neither could divest
 Themselves of it but like some awful fetch
 The holy Friar had to recognize
 The image of his fate in heathen guise

 He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow
 He saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill
 He saw the gopher standing in his burrow
 He saw the squirrel scampering at his will
 He saw all this and felt no doubt how thorough
 The contrast was to his condition still
 The squaw kept onward to the sea till night
 And the cold seafog hid them both from sight

 The morning came above the serried coast
 Lighting the snowpeaks with its beaconfires
 Driving before it all the fleetwinged host
 Of chattering birds above the Mission spires
 Filling the land with light and joy but most
 The savage woods with all their leafy lyres
 In pearly tints and opal flame and fire
 The morning came but not the holy Friar

 Weeks passed away In vain the Fathers sought
 Some trace or token that might tell his story
 Some thought him dead or like Elijah caught
 Up to the heavens in a blaze of glory
 In this surmise some miracles were wrought
 On his account and souls in purgatory
 Were thought to profit from his intercession
 In brief his absence made a deep impression

 A twelvemonth passed the welcome Spring once more
 Made green the hills beside the whitefaced Mission
 Spread her bright dais by the western shore
 And sat enthroned a most resplendent vision
 The heathen converts thronged the chapel door
 At morning mass when says the old tradition
 A frightful whoop throughout the church resounded
 And to their feet the congregation bounded

 A tramp of hoofs upon the beaten course
 Then came a sight that made the bravest quail
 A phantom Friar on a spectre horse
 Dragged by a creature decked with horns and tail
 By the lone Mission with the whirlwinds force
 They madly swept and left a sulphurous trail
 And that was allenough to tell the story
 And leave unblessed those souls in purgatory

 And ever after on that fatal day
 That Friar Pedro rode abroad lassoing
 A ghostly couple came and went away
 With savage whoop and heathenish hallooing
 Which brought discredit on San Luis Rey
 And proved the Missions ruin and undoing
 For ere ten years had passed the squaw and Friar
 Performed to empty walls and fallen spire

 The Mission is no more upon its wall
 The golden lizards slip or breathless pause
 Still as the sunshine brokenly that falls
 Through crannied roof and spiderwebs of gauze
 No more the bell its solemn warning calls
 A holier silence thrills and overawes
 And the sharp lights and shadows of today
 Outline the Mission of San Luis Rey




IN THE MISSION GARDEN

 1865

 FATHER FELIPE

 I speak not the English well but Pachita
 She speak for me is it not so my Pancha
 Eh little rogue Come salute me the stranger
 Americano

 Sir in my country we say Where the heart is
 There live the speech Ah you not understand So
 Pardon an old manwhat you call old fogy
 Padre Felipe

 Old Senor old just so old as the Mission
 You see that peartree How old you think Senor
 Fifteen year Twenty Ah Senor just fifty
 Gone since I plant him

 You like the wine It is some at the Mission
 Made from the grape of the year eighteen hundred
 All the same time when the earthquake he come to
 San Juan Bautista

 But Pancha is twelve and she is the rosetree
 And I am the olive and this is the garden
 And Pancha we say but her name is Francisca
 Same like her mother

 Eh you knew HER No Ah it is a story
 But I speak not like Pachita the English
 So if I try you will sit here beside me
 And shall not laugh eh

 When the American come to the Mission
 Many arrive at the house of Francisca
 Onehe was fine manhe buy the cattle
 Of Jose Castro

 So he came much and Francisca she saw him
 And it was loveand a very dry season
 And the pears bake on the treeand the rain come
 But not Francisca

 Not for one year and one night I have walk much
 Under the olivetree when comes Francisca
 Comes to me here with her child this Francisca
 Under the olivetree

 Sir it was sad but I speak not the English
 So she stay here and she wait for her husband
 He come no more and she sleep on the hillside
 There stands Pachita

 Ah theres the Angelus Will you not enter
 Or shall you walk in the garden with Pancha
 Go little roguest attend to the stranger
 Adios Senor

 PACHITA briskly

 So hes been telling that yarn about mother
 Bless you he tells it to every stranger
 Folks about yer say the old mans my father
 Whats your opinion




THE LOST GALLEON

 In sixteen hundred and fortyone
 The regular yearly galleon
 Laden with odorous gums and spice
 India cottons and India rice
 And the richest silks of far Cathay
 Was due at Acapulco Bay

 Due she was and overdue
 Galleon merchandise and crew
 Creeping along through rain and shine
 Through the tropics under the line
 The trains were waiting outside the walls
 The wives of sailors thronged the town
 The traders sat by their empty stalls
 And the Viceroy himself came down
 The bells in the tower were all atrip
 Te Deums were on each Fathers lip
 The limes were ripening in the sun
 For the sick of the coming galleon

 All in vain Weeks passed away
 And yet no galleon saw the bay
 India goods advanced in price
 The Governor missed his favorite spice
 The Senoritas mourned for sandal
 And the famous cottons of Coromandel
 And some for an absent lover lost
 And one for a husbandDona Julia
 Wife of the captain tempesttossed
 In circumstances so peculiar
 Even the Fathers unawares
 Grumbled a little at their prayers
 And all along the coast that year
 Votive candles wore scarce and dear

 Never a tear bedims the eye
 That time and patience will not dry
 Never a lip is curved with pain
 That cant be kissed into smiles again
 And these same truths as far as I know
 Obtained on the coast of Mexico
 More than two hundred years ago
 In sixteen hundred and fiftyone
 Ten years after the deed was done
 And folks had forgotten the galleon
 The divers plunged in the gulf for pearls
 White as the teeth of the Indian girls
 The traders sat by their full bazaars
 The mules with many a weary load
 And oxen dragging their creaking cars
 Came and went on the mountain road

 Where was the galleon all this while
 Wrecked on some lonely coral isle
 Burnt by the roving seamarauders
 Or sailing north under secret orders
 Had she found the Anian passage famed
 By lying Maldonado claimed
 And sailed through the sixtyfifth degree
 Direct to the North Atlantic Sea
 Or had she found the River of Kings
 Of which De Fonte told such strange things
 In sixteen forty Never a sign
 East or west or under the line
 They saw of the missing galleon
 Never a sail or plank or chip
 They found of the longlost treasureship
 Or enough to build a tale upon
 But when she was lost and where and how
 Are the facts were coming to just now

 Take if you please the chart of that day
 Published at Madridpor el Rey
 Look for a spot in the old South Sea
 The hundred and eightieth degree
 Longitude west of Madrid there
 Under the equatorial glare
 Just where the east and west are one
 Youll find the missing galleon
 Youll find the San Gregorio yet
 Riding the seas with sails all set
 Fresh as upon the very day
 She sailed from Acapulco Bay

 How did she get there What strange spell
 Kept her two hundred years so well
 Free from decay and mortal taint
 What but the prayers of a patron saint

 A hundred leagues from Manilla town
 The San Gregorios helm came down
 Round she went on her heel and not
 A cables length from a galliot
 That rocked on the waters just abreast
 Of the galleons course which was westsouwest

 Then said the galleons commandante
 General Pedro Sobriente
 That was his rank on land and main
 A regular custom of Old Spain
 My pilot is dead of scurvy may
 I ask the longitude time and day
 The first two given and compared
 The thirdthe commandante stared
 The FIRST of June I make it second
 Said the stranger Then youve wrongly reckoned
 I make it FIRST as you came this way
 You should have lost dye see a day
 Lost a day as plainly see
 On the hundred and eightieth degree
 Lost a day Yes if not rude
 When did you make east longitude
 On the ninth of Mayour patrons day
 On the ninthYOU HAD NO NINTH OF MAY
 Eighth and tenth was there but stay
 Too late for the galleon bore away

 Lost was the day they should have kept
 Lost unheeded and lost unwept
 Lost in a way that made search vain
 Lost in a trackless and boundless main
 Lost like the day of Jobs awful curse
 In his third chapter third and fourth verse
 Wrecked was their patrons only day
 What would the holy Fathers say

 Said the Fray Antonio Estavan
 The galleons chaplaina learned man
 Nothing is lost that you can regain
 And the way to look for a thing is plain
 To go where you lost it back again
 Back with your galleon till you see
 The hundred and eightieth degree
 Wait till the rolling year goes round
 And there will the missing day be found
 For youll find if computations true
 That sailing EAST will give to you
 Not only one ninth of May but two
 One for the good saints present cheer
 And one for the day we lost last year

 Back to the spot sailed the galleon
 Where for a twelvemonth off and on
 The hundred and eightieth degree
 She rose and fell on a tropic sea
 But lo when it came to the ninth of May
 All of a sudden becalmed she lay
 One degree from that fatal spot
 Without the power to move a knot
 And of course the moment she lost her way
 Gone was her chance to save that day

 To cut a lengthening story short
 She never saved it Made the sport
 Of evil spirits and baffling wind
 She was always before or just behind
 One day too soon or one day too late
 And the sun meanwhile would never wait
 She had two Eighths as she idly lay
 Two Tenths but never a NINTH of May
 And there she rides through two hundred years
 Of dreary penance and anxious fears
 Yet through the grace of the saint she served
 Captain and crew are still preserved

 By a computation that still holds good
 Made by the Holy Brotherhood
 The San Gregorio will cross that line
 In nineteen hundred and thirtynine
 Just three hundred years to a day
 From the time she lost the ninth of May
 And the folk in Acapulco town
 Over the waters looking down
 Will see in the glow of the setting sun
 The sails of the missing galleon
 And the royal standard of Philip Rey
 The gleaming mast and glistening spar
 As she nears the surf of the outer bar
 A Te Deum sung on her crowded deck
 An odor of spice along the shore
 A crash a cry from a shattered wreck
 And the yearly galleon sails no more
 In or out of the olden bay
 For the blessed patron has found his day

 

 Such is the legend Hear this truth
 Over the trackless past somewhere
 Lie the lost days of our tropic youth
 Only regained by faith and prayer
 Only recalled by prayer and plaint
 Each lost day has its patron saint

 Up to our flanks in the gulch and Rattlesnake Creek just abilin
 Not a plank left in the dam and nary a bridge on the river
 I had the gray and the Jedge had his roan and his nevey Chiquita

 Lickity lickity switch we came to the ford and Chiquita

DOWS FLAT

 1856

 Dows Flat Thats its name
 And I reckon that you
 Are a stranger The same
 Well I thought it was true
 For thar isnt a man on the river as cant spot the place at first
 view

 It was called after Dow
 Which the same was an ass
 And as to the how
 Thet the thing kem to pass
 Jest tie up your hoss to that buckeye and sit ye down here in the
 grass

 You see this yer Dow
 Hed the worst kind of luck
 He slipped up somehow
 On each thing thet he struck
 Why ef hed a straddled thet fencerail the derned thingd get up
 and buck

 He mined on the bar
 Till he couldnt pay rates
 He was smashed by a car
 When he tunneled with Bates
 And right on the top of his trouble kem his wife and five kids from
 the States

 It was roughmighty rough
 But the boys they stood by
 And they brought him the stuff
 For a house on the sly
 And the old womanwell she did washing and took on when no one
 was nigh

 But this yer luck of Dows
 Was so powerful mean
 That the spring near his house
 Dried right up on the green
 And he sunk forty feet down for water but nary a drop to be seen

 Then the bar petered out
 And the boys wouldnt stay
 And the chills got about
 And his wife fell away
 But Dow in his well kept a peggin in his usual ridikilous way

 One dayit was June
 And a year ago jest
 This Dow kem at noon
 To his work like the rest
 With a shovel and pick on his shoulder and derringer hid in his
 breast

 He goes to the well
 And he stands on the brink
 And stops for a spell
 Jest to listen and think
 For the sun in his eyes jest like this sir you see kinder made
 the cuss blink

 His two ragged gals
 In the gulch were at play
 And a gownd that was Sals
 Kinder flapped on a bay
 Not much for a man to be leavin but his allas Ive heerd the
 folks say

 AndThats a peart hoss
 Thet youve gotaint it now
 What might be her cost
 Eh OhWell then Dow
 Lets seewell that fortyfoot grave wasnt his sir that day
 anyhow

 For a blow of his pick
 Sorter caved in the side
 And he looked and turned sick
 Then he trembled and cried
 For you see the dern cuss had struckWaterBeg your parding
 young manthere you lied

 It was GOLDin the quartz
 And it ran all alike
 And I reckon five oughts
 Was the worth of that strike
 And that house with the coopilows hisnwhich the same isnt bad
 for a Pike

 Thets why its Dows Flat
 And the thing of it is
 That he kinder got that
 Through sheer contrairiness
 For twas WATER the derned cuss was seekin and his luck made him
 certain to miss

 Thets so Thars your way
 To the left of yon tree
 Butalook hyur say
 Wont you come up to tea
 No Well then the next time youre passin and ask after Dow

CICELY

 ALKALI STATION

 Cicely says youre a poet maybeI aint much on rhyme
 I reckon youd give me a hundred and beat me every time
 Poetrythats the way some chaps puts up an idee
 But I takes mine straight without sugar and thats whats the
 matter with me

 Poetryjust look round youalkali rock and sage
 Sagebrush rock and alkali aint it a pretty page
 Sun in the east at mornin sun in the west at night
 And the shadow of this yer station the ony thing moves in sight

 PoetryWell nowPolly Polly run to your mam
 Run right away my pooty Byby Aint she a lamb
 Poetrythat reminds me o suthin right in that suit
 Jest shet that door thar will yerfor Cicelys ears is cute

 Ye noticed Pollythe baby A month afore she was born
 Cicelymy old womanwas moodylike and forlorn
 Out of her head and crazy and talked of flowers and trees
 Family man yourself sir Well you know what a woman bes

 Narvous she was and restlesssaid that she couldnt stay
 Stayand the nearest woman seventeen miles away
 But I fixed it up with the doctor and he said he would be on hand
 And I kinder stuck by the shanty and fenced in that bit o land

 One nightthe tenth of OctoberI woke with a chill and a fright
 For the door it was standing open and Cicely warnt in sight
 But a note was pinned on the blanket which it said that she
 couldnt stay
 But had gone to visit her neighborseventeen miles away

 When and how she stampeded I didnt wait for to see
 For out in the road next minit I started as wild as she
 Running first this way and that way like a hound that is off the
 scent
 For there warnt no track in the darkness to tell me the way she went

 Ive had some mighty mean moments afore I kem to this spot
 Lost on the Plains in 50 drownded almost and shot
 But out on this alkali desert ahunting a crazy wife
 Was raly as onsatisfactory as anything in my life

 Cicely Cicely Cicely I called and I held my breath
 And Cicely came from the canyonand all was as still as death
 And Cicely Cicely Cicely came from the rocks below
 And jest but a whisper of Cicely down from them peaks of snow

 I aint what you call religiousbut I jest looked up to the sky
 Andthis yers to what Im coming and maybe ye think I lie
 But up away to the eastard yaller and big and far
 I saw of a suddent rising the singlerist kind of star

 Big and yaller and dancing it seemed to beckon to me
 Yaller and big and dancing such as you never see
 Big and yaller and dancingI never saw such a star
 And I thought of them sharps in the Bible and I went for it then
 and thar

 Over the brush and bowlders I stumbled and pushed ahead
 Keeping the star afore me I went wherever it led
 It might hev been for an hour when suddent and peart and nigh
 Out of the yearth afore me thar riz up a babys cry

 Listen thars the same music but her lungs they are stronger now
 Than the day I packed her and her motherIm derned if I jest know
 how
 But the doctor kem the next minit and the joke o the whole thing is
 That Cis never knew what happened from that very night to this

 But Cicely says youre a poet and maybe you might some day
 Jest sling her a rhyme bout a baby that was born in a curious way
 And see what she says and old fellow when you speak of the star
 dont tell
 As how twas the doctors lanternfor maybe twont sound so well

PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES

 TABLE MOUNTAIN 1870

 Which I wish to remark
 And my language is plain
 That for ways that are dark
 And for tricks that are vain
 The heathen Chinee is peculiar
 Which the same I would rise to explain

 Ah Sin was his name
 And I shall not deny
 In regard to the same
 What that name might imply
 But his smile it was pensive and childlike
 As I frequent remarked to Bill Nye

 It was August the third
 And quite soft was the skies
 Which it might be inferred
 That Ah Sin was likewise
 Yet he played it that day upon William
 And me in a way I despise

 Which we had a small game
 And Ah Sin took a hand
 It was Euchre The same
 He did not understand
 But he smiled as he sat by the table
 With the smile that was childlike and bland

 Yet the cards they were stocked
 In a way that I grieve
 And my feelings were shocked
 At the state of Nyes sleeve
 Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers
 And the same with intent to deceive

 But the hands that were played
 By that heathen Chinee
 And the points that he made
 Were quite frightful to see
 Till at last he put down a right bower
 Which the same Nye had dealt unto me

 Then I looked up at Nye
 And he gazed upon me
 And he rose with a sigh
 And said Can this be
 We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor
 And he went for that heathen Chinee

 In the scene that ensued
 I did not take a hand
 But the floor it was strewed
 Like the leaves on the strand
 With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding
 In the game he did not understand

 In his sleeves which were long
 He had twentyfour packs
 Which was coming it strong
 Yet I state but the facts
 And we found on his nails which were taper
 What is frequent in tapersthats wax

 Which is why I remark
 And my language is plain
 That for ways that are dark
 And for tricks that are vain
 The heathen Chinee is peculiar
 Which the same I am free to maintain




THE SOCIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS

 I reside at Table Mountain and my name is Truthful James
 I am not up to small deceit or any sinful games
 And Ill tell in simple language what I know about the row
 That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow

 But first I would remark that it is not a proper plan
 For any scientific gent to whale his fellowman
 And if a member dont agree with his peculiar whim
 To lay for that same member for to put a head on him

 Now nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see
 Than the first six months proceedings of that same Society
 Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones
 That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones

 Then Brown he read a paper and he reconstructed there
 From those same bones an animal that was extremely rare
 And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules
 Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules

 Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile and said he was at fault
 It seemed he had been trespassing on Joness family vault
 He was a most sarcastic man this quiet Mr Brown
 And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town

 Now I hold it is not decent for a scientific gent
 To say another is an assat least to all intent
 Nor should the individual who happens to be meant
 Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent

 Then Abner Dean of Angels raised a point of order when
 A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen
 And he smiled a kind of sickly smile and curled up on the floor
 And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more

 For in less time than I write it every member did engage
 In a warfare with the remnants of a palaeozoic age
 And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin
 Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in

 And this is all I have to say of these improper games
 For I live at Table Mountain and my name is Truthful James
 And Ive told in simple language what I know about the row
 That broke up our Society upon the Stanislow




LUKE

 IN THE COLORADO PARK 1873

 Wots that youre readina novel A novelwell darn my skin
 You a man grown and bearded and histin such stuff ez that in
 Stuff about gals and their sweethearts No wonder youre thin ez a
 knife
 Look at meclar two hundredand never read one in my life

 Thats my opinion o novels And ez to their lyin round here
 They belong to the Jedges daughterthe Jedge who came up last year
 On account of his lungs and the mountains and the balsam o pine and
 fir
 And his daughterwell she read novels and thats whats the
 matter with her

 Yet she was sweet on the Jedge and stuck by him day and night
 Alone in the cabin up yertill she grew like a ghost all white
 She wus only a slip of a thing ez light and ez up and away
 Ez rifle smoke blown through the woods but she wasnt my kindno
 way

 Speakin o gals dye mind that house ez you rise the hill
 A mile and a half from Whites and jist above Mattinglys mill
 You do Well now THARs a gal What you saw her Oh come now
 thar quit
 She was only bedevlin you boys for to me she dont cotton one bit

 Now shes what I call a galez pretty and plump ez a quail
 Teeth ez white ez a hounds and theyd go through a tenpenny nail
 Eyes that kin snap like a cap So she asked to know whar I was hid
 She did Oh its jist like her sass for shes peart ez a Katydid

 But what was I talking ofOh the Jedge and his daughtershe read
 Novels the whole day long and I reckon she read them abed
 And sometimes she read them out loud to the Jedge on the porch where
 he sat
 And twas how Lord Augustus said this and how Lady Blanche she
 said that

 But the sickest of all that I heerd was a yarn thet they read bout
 a chap
 Leatherstocking by name and a hunter chock full o the greenest
 o sap
 And they asked me to hear but I says Miss Mabel not any for me
 When I likes I kin sling my own lies and thet chap and I shouldnt
 agree

 Yet somehow or other that gal allus said that I brought her to mind
 Of folks about whom she had read or suthin belike of thet kind
 And thar warnt no end o the names that she give me thet summer up
 here
 Robin Hood Leatherstocking Rob RoyOh I tell you the
 critter was queer

 And yet ef she hadnt been spiled she was harmless enough in her
 way
 She could jabber in French to her dad and they said that she knew
 how to play
 And she worked me that shotpouch up thar which the man doesnt
 live ez kin use
 And slippersyou see em down yerez would cradle an Injins
 papoose

 Yet along o them novels you see she was wastin and mopin away
 And then she got shy with her tongue and at last she had nothin to
 say
 And whenever I happened around her face it was hid by a book
 And it warnt till the day she left that she give me ez much ez a
 look

 And this was the way it was It was night when I kem up here
 To say to em all goodby for I reckoned to go for deer
 At sun up the day they left So I shook em all round by the hand
 Cept Mabel and she was sick ez they give me to understand

 But jist ez I passed the house next morning at dawn some one
 Like a little waver o mist got up on the hill with the sun
 Miss Mabel it was aloneall wrapped in a mantle o lace
 And she stood there straight in the road with a touch o the sun in
 her face

 And she looked me right in the eyeId seen suthin like it before
 When I hunted a wounded doe to the edge o the Clear Lake Shore
 And I had my knee on its neck and I jist was raisin my knife
 When it give me a look like that andwell it got off with its life

 We are going today she said and I thought I would say goodby
 To you in your own house Lukethese woods and the bright blue sky
 Youve always been kind to us Luke and papa has found you still
 As good as the air he breathes and wholesome as Laurel Tree Hill

 And well always think of you Luke as the thing we could not take
 away
 The balsam that dwells in the woods the rainbow that lives in the
 spray
 And youll sometimes think of ME Luke as you know you once used to
 say
 A rifle smoke blown through the woods a moment but never to stay

 And then we shook hands She turned but asuddent she tottered and
 fell
 And I caught her sharp by the waist and held her a minit Well
 It was only a minit you know thet ez cold and ez white she lay
 Ez a snowflake here on my breast and thenwell she melted away

 And was gone And thar are her books but I says not any for me
 Good enough may be for some but them and I mightnt agree
 They spiled a decent gal ez might hev made some chap a wife
 And look at meclar two hundredand never read one in my life




THE BABES IN THE WOODS

 BIG PINE FLAT 1871

 Something characteristic eh
 Humph I reckon you mean by that
 Something that happened in our way
 Here at the crossin of Big Pine Flat
 Times arent now as they used to be
 When gold was flush and the boys were frisky
 And a man would pull out his battery
 For anythingmaybe the price of whiskey

 Nothing of that sort eh Thats strange
 Why I thought you might be diverted
 Hearing how Jones of Red Rock Range
 Drawed his hint to the unconverted
 And saying Whar will you have it shot
 Cherokee Bob at the last debating
 What was the question I forgot
 But Jones didnt like Bobs way of stating

 Nothing of that kind eh You mean
 Something milder Lets seeO Joe
 Tell to the stranger that little scene
 Out of the Babes in the Woods You know
 Babes was the name that we gave em sir
 Two lean lads in their teens and greener
 Than even the belt of spruce and fir
 Where they built their nest and each day grew leaner

 No one knew where they came from None
 Cared to ask if they had a mother
 Runaway schoolboys maybe One
 Tall and dark as a spruce the other
 Blue and gold in the eyes and hair
 Soft and low in his speech but rarely
 Talking with us and we didnt care
 To get at their secret at all unfairly

 For they were so quiet so sad and shy
 Content to trust each other solely
 That somehow wed always shut one eye
 And never seem to observe them wholly
 As they passed to their work Twas a wornout claim
 And it paid them grub They could live without it
 For the boys had a way of leaving game
 In their tent and forgetting all about it

 Yet no one asked for their secret Dumb
 It lay in their big eyes heavy hollows
 It was understood that no one should come
 To their tent unawares save the bees and swallows
 So they lived alone Until one warm night
 I was sitting here at the tentdoorso sir
 When out of the sunsets rosy light
 Up rose the Sheriff of Mariposa

 I knew at once there was something wrong
 For his hand and his voice shook just a little
 And there isnt much you can fetch along
 To make the sinews of Jack Hill brittle
 Go warn the Babes he whispered hoarse
 Tell them Im comingto get and scurry
 For Ive got a story thats badand worse
 Ive got a warrant Gd dn it hurry

 Too late they had seen him cross the hill
 I ran to their tent and found them lying
 Dead in each others arms and still
 Clasping the drug they had taken flying
 And there lay their secret cold and bare
 Their life their trialthe old old story
 For the sweet blue eyes and the golden hair
 Was a WOMANS shame and a WOMANS glory

 Who were they Ask no more or ask
 The sun that visits their grave so lightly
 Ask of the whispering reeds or task
 The mourning crickets that chirrup nightly
 All of their life but its love forgot
 Everything tender and soft and mystic
 These are our Babes in the Woodsyouve got
 Wellhuman naturethats characteristic




THE LATEST CHINESE OUTRAGE

 It was noon by the sun we had finished our game
 And was passin remarks goin back to our claim
 Jones was countin his chips Smith relievin his mind
 Of ideas that a straight should beat three of a kind
 When Johnson of Elko came gallopin down
 With a look on his face twixt a grin and a frown
 And he calls Drop your shovels and face right about
 For them Chinees from Murphys are cleanin us out
 With their chingaringchow
 And their chiccolorow
 Theyre bent upon making
 No slouch of a row

 Then Jonesmy own pardnerlooks up with a sigh
 Its your washbill sez he and I answers You lie
 But afore he could draw or the others could arm
 Up tumbles the Bates boys who heard the alarm
 And a yell from the hilltop and roar of a gong
 Mixed up with remarks like Hi yi Changawong
 And bombs shells and crackers that crashed through the trees
 Revealed in their wartogs four hundred Chinees
 Four hundred Chinee
 We are eight dont ye see
 That made a square fifty
 To just one o we

 They were dressed in their best but I grieve that that same
 Was largely made up of our own to their shame
 And my pardners best shirt and his trousers were hung
 On a spear and above him were tauntingly swung
 While that beggar Chey Lee like a conjurer sat
 Pullin out eggs and chickens from Johnsons best hat
 And Batess game rooster was part of their loot
 And all of Smiths pigs were skyugled to boot
 But the climax was reached and I like to have died
 When my demijohn empty came down the hillside
 Down the hillside
 What once held the pride
 Of Robertson County
 Pitched down the hillside

 Then we axed for a parley When out of the din
 To the front comes arockin that heathen Ah Sin
 You owe flowty dolleeme washee you camp
 You catchee my washeeme catchee no stamp
 One dollar hap dozen me no catchee yet
 Now that flowty dolleeno habhow can get
 Me catchee you piggeeme sellee for cash
 It catchee me liceeyou catchee no hash
 Me belly good Sheliffme lebbee when can
 Me allee same halp pin as Melican man
 But Melican man
 He washee him pan
 On BOTTOM side hillee
 And catcheehow can

 Are we men says Joe Johnson and list to this jaw
 Without process of warrant or color of law
 Are we men orachewhere be gasped in his speech
 For a stinkpot had fallen just out of his reach
 Shall we stand here as idle and let Asia pour
 Her barbaric hordes on this civilized shore
 Has the White Man no country Are we left in the lurch
 And likewise whats gone of the Established Church
 One man to four hundred is great odds I own
 But this yers a White ManI plays it alone
 And he sprang up the hillsideto stop him none dare
 Till a yell from the top told a White Man was there
 A White Man was there
 We prayed he might spare
 Those misguided heathens
 The few clothes they wear

 They fled and he followed but no matter where
 They fled to escape himthe White Man was there
 Till we missed first his voice on the pinewooded slope
 And we knew for the heathen henceforth was no hope
 And the yells they grew fainter when Petersen said
 It simply was human to bury his dead
 And then with slow tread
 We crept up in dread
 But found nary mortal there
 Living or dead

 But there was his trail and the way that they came
 And yonder no doubt he was bagging his game
 When Jones drops his pickaxe and Thompson says Shoo
 And both of em points to a cage of bamboo
 Hanging down from a tree with a label that swung
 Conspicuous with letters in some foreign tongue
 Which when freely translated the same did appear
 Was the Chinese for saying A White Man is here
 And as we drew near
 In anger and fear
 Bound hand and foot Johnson
 Looked down with a leer

 In his mouth was an opium pipewhich was why
 He leered at us so with a drunkenlike eye
 They had shaved off his eyebrows and tacked on a cue
 They had painted his face of a coppery hue
 And rigged him all up in a heathenish suit
 Then softly departed each man with his loot
 Yes every galoot
 And Ah Sin to boot
 Had left him there hanging
 Like ripening fruit

 At a mass meeting held up at Murphys next day
 There were seventeen speakers and each had his say
 There were twelve resolutions that instantly passed
 And each resolution was worse than the last
 There were fourteen petitions which granting the same
 Will determine what Governor Murphys shall name
 And the man from our district that goes up next year
 Goes up on one issuethats patent and clear
 Can the work of a mean
 Degraded unclean
 Believer in Buddha
 Be held as a lien




TRUTHFUL JAMES TO THE EDITOR

 YREKA 1873

 Which it is not my style
 To produce needless pain
 By statements that rile
 Or that go gin the grain
 But heres Captain Jack still alivin and Nye has no skelp on his
 brain

 On that Caucasian head
 There is no crown of hair
 It has gone it has fled
 And Echo sez Where
 And I asks Is this Nation a White Mans and is generally things
 on the square

 She was known in the camp
 As Nyes other squaw
 And folks of that stamp
 Hez no rights in the law
 But is treacherous sinful and slimy as Nye might hev well known
 before

 But she said that she knew
 Where the Injins was hid
 And the statement was true
 For it seemed that she did
 Since she led William where he was covered by seventeen Modocs and
 slid

 Then they reached for his hair
 But Nye sez By the law
 Of nations forbear
 I surrendersno more
 And I looks to be treatedyou hear meas a prisner a prisner
 of war

 But Captain Jack rose
 And he sez Its too thin
 Such statements as those
 Its too late to begin
 Theres a MODOC INDICTMENT agin you O Paleface and youre goin in

 You stole Schonchins squaw
 In the year sixtytwo
 It was in sixtyfour
 That Long Jack you went through
 And you burned Nasty Jims rancheria and his wives and his papooses
 too

 This gun in my hand
 Was sold me by you
 Gainst the law of the land
 And I grieves it is true
 And he buried his face in his blanket and wept as he hid it from view

 But youre tried and condemned
 And skelpings your doom
 And he paused and he hemmed
 But why this resume
 He was skelped gainst the custom of nations and cut off like a rose
 in its bloom

 So I asks without guile
 And I trusts not in vain
 If this is the style
 That is going to obtain
 If heres Captain Jack still alivin and Nye with no skelp on his
 brain

DRAMATIS PERSONAE

 First Tourist
 Second Tourist
 Yuba Bill Driver
 A Stranger


 FIRST TOURIST

 Look how the upland plunges into cover
 Green where the pines fade sullenly away
 Wonderful those olive depths and wonderful moreover

 SECOND TOURIST

 The red dust that rises in a suffocating way

 FIRST TOURIST

 Small is the soul that cannot soar above it
 Cannot but cling to its everkindred clay
 Better be yon bird that seems to breathe and love it

 SECOND TOURIST

 Doubtless a hawk or some other bird of prey
 Were we like him as sure of a dinner
 That on our stomachs would comfortably stay
 Or were the fried ham a shade or two just thinner
 That must confront us at closing of the day
 Then might you sing like Theocritus or Virgil
 Then might we each make a metrical essay
 But verse just nowI must protest and urgeill
 Fits a digestion by travel led astray

 CHORUS OF PASSENGERS

 Speed Yuba Bill oh speed us to our dinner
 Speed to the sunset that beckons far away

 SECOND TOURIST

 William of Yuba O Son of Nimshi hearken
 Check thy profanity but not thy chariots play
 Tell us O William before the shadows darken
 Where and oh how we shall dine O William say

 YUBA BILL

 It aint my fault nor the Kumpeneys I reckon
 Ye cant get ez square meal ez any on the Bay
 Up at you place whar the senset pears to beckon
 Ez thet sharp allows in his airy sort o way
 Thar woz a place wor yer hash ye might hev wrestled
 Kept by a woman ez chipper ez a jay
 Warm in her breast all the morning sunshine nestled
 Red on her cheeks all the evenings sunshine lay

 SECOND TOURIST

 Praise is but breath O chariot compeller
 Yet of that hash we would bid you farther say

 YUBA BILL

 Thar woz a snipelike you a fancy tourist
 Kem to that ranch ez if to make a stay
 Ran off the gal and ruined jist the purist
 Critter that lived

 STRANGER quietly

 Youre a liar driver

 YUBA BILL reaching for his revolver

 Eh
 Here take my lines somebody

 CHORUS OF PASSENGERS

 Hush boys listen
 Inside theres a lady Remember No affray

 YUBA BILL

 Ef that man lives the fault aint mine or hisn

 STRANGER

 Wait for the sunset that beckons far away
 Thenas you will But meantime friends believe me
 Nowhere on earth lives a purer woman nay
 If my perceptions do surely not deceive me
 She is the lady we have inside today
 As for the manyou see that blackened pine tree
 Up which the green vine creeps heavenward away
 He was that scarred trunk and she the vine that sweetly
 Clothed him with life again and lifted

 SECOND TOURIST

 Yes but pray
 How know you this

 STRANGER

 Shes my wife

 YUBA BILL

 The hll you say




THOMPSON OF ANGELS

 It is the story of Thompsonof Thompson the hero of Angels
 Frequently drunk was Thompson but always polite to the stranger
 Light and free was the touch of Thompson upon his revolver
 Great the mortality incident on that lightness and freedom

 Yet not happy or gay was Thompson the hero of Angels
 Often spoke to himself in accents of anguish and sorrow
 Why do I make the graves of the frivolous youth who in folly
 Thoughtlessly pass my revolver forgetting its lightness and freedom

 Why in my daily walks does the surgeon drop his left eyelid
 The undertaker smile and the sculptor of gravestone marbles
 Lean on his chisel and gaze I care not oer much for attention
 Simple am I in my ways save but for this lightness and freedom

 So spake that pensive manthis Thompson the hero of Angels
 Bitterly smiled to himself as he strode through the chapparal musing
 Why oh why echoed the pines in the dark olive depth far
 resounding
 Why indeed whispered the sage brush that bent neath his feet
 nonelastic

 Pleasant indeed was that morn that dawned oer the barroom at Angels
 Where in their manhoods prime was gathered the pride of the hamlet
 Six took sugar in theirs and nine to the barkeeper lightly
 Smiled as they said Well Jim you can give us our regular fusil

 Suddenly as the gray hawk swoops down on the barnyard alighting
 Where pensively picking their corn the favorite pullets are
 gathered
 So in that festive barroom dropped Thompson the hero of Angels
 Grasping his weapon dread with his pristine lightness and freedom

 Never a word he spoke divesting himself of his garments
 Danced the wardance of the playful yet truculent Modoc
 Uttered a single whoop and then in the accents of challenge
 Spake Oh behold in me a Crested Jay Hawk of the mountain

 Then rose a pallid mana man sick with fever and ague
 Small was he and his step was tremulous weak and uncertain
 Slowly a Derringer drew and covered the person of Thompson
 Said in his feeblest pipe Im a Baldheaded Snipe of the Valley

 As on its native plains the kangaroo startled by hunters
 Leaps with successive bounds and hurries away to the thickets
 So leaped the Crested Hawk and quietly hopping behind him
 Ran and occasionally shot that Baldheaded Snipe of the Valley

 Vain at the festive bar still lingered the people of Angels
 Hearing afar in the woods the petulant pop of the pistol
 Never again returned the Crested Jay Hawk of the mountains
 Never again was seen the Baldheaded Snipe of the Valley

 Yet in the hamlet of Angels when truculent speeches are uttered
 When bloodshed and life alone will atone for some trifling
 misstatement
 Maidens and men in their prime recall the last hero of Angels
 Think of and vainly regret the Baldheaded Snipe of the Valley




THE HAWKS NEST

 SIERRAS

 We checked our pace the red road sharply rounding
 We heard the troubled flow
 Of the dark olive depths of pines resounding
 A thousand feet below

 Above the tumult of the canyon lifted
 The gray hawk breathless hung
 Or on the hill a winged shadow drifted
 Where furze and thornbush clung

 Or where halfway the mountain side was furrowed
 With many a seam and scar
 Or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed
 A molehill seen so far

 We looked in silence down across the distant
 Unfathomable reach
 A silence broken by the guides consistent
 And realistic speech

 Walker of Murphys blew a hole through Peters
 For telling him he lied
 Then up and dusted out of South Hornitos
 Across the Long Divide

 We ran him out of Strongs and up through Eden
 And cross the ford below
 And up this canyon Peters brother leadin
 And me and Clark and Joe

 He fout us game somehow I disremember
 Jest how the thing kem round
 Some say twas wadding some a scattered ember
 From fires on the ground

 But in one minute all the hill below him
 Was just one sheet of flame
 Guardin the crest Sam Clark and I called to him
 Andwell the dog was game

 He made no sign the fires of hell were round him
 The pit of hell below
 We sat and waited but we never found him
 And then we turned to go

 And thenyou see that rock thats grown so bristly
 With chapparal and tan
 Suthin crep out it might hev been a grizzly
 It might hev been a man

 Suthin that howled and gnashed its teeth and shouted
 In smoke and dust and flame
 Suthin that sprang into the depths about it
 Grizzly or manbut game

 Thats all Well yes it does look rather risky
 And kinder makes one queer
 And dizzy looking down A drop of whiskey
 Aint a bad thing right here




HER LETTER

 Im sitting alone by the fire
 Dressed just as I came from the dance
 In a robe even YOU would admire
 It cost a cool thousand in France
 Im bediamonded out of all reason
 My hair is done up in a cue
 In short sir the belle of the season
 Is wasting an hour upon you

 A dozen engagements Ive broken
 I left in the midst of a set
 Likewise a proposal half spoken
 That waitson the stairsfor me yet
 They say hell be richwhen he grows up
 And then he adores me indeed
 And you sir are turning your nose up
 Three thousand miles off as you read

 And how do I like my position
 And what do I think of New York
 And now in my higher ambition
 With whom do I waltz flirt or talk
 And isnt it nice to have riches
 And diamonds and silks and all that
 And arent they a change to the ditches
 And tunnels of Poverty Flat

 Well yesif you saw us out driving
 Each day in the Park fourinhand
 If you saw poor dear mamma contriving
 To look supernaturally grand
 If you saw papas picture as taken
 By Brady and tinted at that
 Youd never suspect he sold bacon
 And flour at Poverty Flat

 And yet just this moment when sitting
 In the glare of the grand chandelier
 In the bustle and glitter befitting
 The finest soiree of the year
 In the mists of a gaze de Chambery
 And the hum of the smallest of talk
 Somehow Joe I thought of the Ferry
 And the dance that we had on The Fork

 Of Harrisons barn with its muster
 Of flags festooned over the wall
 Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
 And tallow on headdress and shawl
 Of the steps that we took to one fiddle
 Of the dress of my queer visavis
 And how I once went down the middle
 With the man that shot Sandy McGee

 Of the moon that was quietly sleeping
 On the hill when the time came to go
 Of the few baby peaks that were peeping
 From under their bedclothes of snow
 Of that ridethat to me was the rarest
 Ofthe something you said at the gate
 Ah Joe then I wasnt an heiress
 To the bestpaying lead in the State

 Well well its all past yet its funny
 To think as I stood in the glare
 Of fashion and beauty and money
 That I should be thinking right there
 Of some one who breasted high water
 And swam the North Fork and all that
 Just to dance with old Folinsbees daughter
 The Lily of Poverty Flat

 But goodness what nonsense Im writing
 Mamma says my taste still is low
 Instead of my triumphs reciting
 Im spooning on Josephheighho
 And Im to be finished by travel
 Whatevers the meaning of that
 Oh why did papa strike pay gravel
 In drifting on Poverty Flat

 Goodnightheres the end of my paper
 Goodnightif the longitude please
 For maybe while wasting my taper
 YOUR suns climbing over the trees
 But know if you havent got riches
 And are poor dearest Joe and all that
 That my hearts somewhere there in the ditches
 And youve struck iton Poverty Flat




HIS ANSWER TO HER LETTER

 REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES

 Being asked by an intimate party
 Which the same I would term as a friend
 Though his health it were vain to call hearty
 Since the mind to deceit it might lend
 For his arm it was broken quite recent
 And theres something gone wrong with his lung
 Which is why it is proper and decent
 I should write what he runs off his tongue

 First he says Miss hes read through your letter
 To the endand the end came too soon
 That a slight illness kept him your debtor
 Which for weeks he was wild as a loon
 That his spirits are buoyant as yours is
 That with you Miss he challenges Fate
 Which the language that invalid uses
 At times it were vain to relate

 And he says that the mountains are fairer
 For once being held in your thought
 That each rock holds a wealth that is rarer
 Than ever by goldseeker sought
 Which are words he would put in these pages
 By a party not given to guile
 Though the claim not at date paying wages
 Might produce in the sinful a smile

 He remembers the ball at the Ferry
 And the ride and the gate and the vow
 And the rose that you gave himthat very
 Same rose he is treasuring now
 Which his blanket hes kicked on his trunk Miss
 And insists on his legs being free
 And his language to me from his bunk Miss
 Is frequent and painful and free

 He hopes you are wearing no willows
 But are happy and gay all the while
 That he knowswhich this dodging of pillows
 Imparts but small ease to the style
 And the same you will pardonhe knows Miss
 That though parted by many a mile
 Yet were HE lying under the snows Miss
 Theyd melt into tears at your smile

 And youll still think of him in your pleasures
 In your brief twilight dreams of the past
 In this green laurel spray that he treasures
 It was plucked where your parting was last
 In this specimenbut a small trifle
 It will do for a pin for your shawl
 Which the truth not to wickedly stifle
 Was his last weeks clean upand HIS ALL

 Hes asleep which the same might seem strange Miss
 Were it not that I scorn to deny
 That I raised his last dose for a change Miss
 In view that his fever was high
 But he lies there quite peaceful and pensive
 And now my respects Miss to you
 Which my language although comprehensive
 Might seem to be freedom is true

 For I have a small favor to ask you
 As concerns a bullpup and the same
 If the duty would not overtask you
 You would please to procure for me GAME
 And send per express to the Flat Miss
 For they say York is famed for the breed
 Which though words of deceit may be that Miss
 Ill trust to your taste Miss indeed

 PSWhich this same interfering
 Into other folks way I despise
 Yet if it so be I was hearing
 That its just empty pockets as lies
 Betwixt you and Joseph it follers
 That having no family claims
 Heres my pile which its six hundred dollars
 As is YOURS with respects
 TRUTHFUL JAMES




THE RETURN OF BELISARIUS

 MUD FLAT 1860

 So youre back from your travels old fellow
 And you left but a twelvemonth ago
 Youve hobnobbed with Louis Napoleon
 Eugenie and kissed the Popes toe
 By Jove it is perfectly stunning
 Astoundingand all that you know
 Yes things are about as you left them
 In Mud Flat a twelvemonth ago

 The boystheyre all rightOh Dick Ashley
 Hes buried somewhere in the snow
 He was lost on the Summit last winter
 And Bob has a hard row to hoe
 You know that hes got the consumption
 You didnt Well come thats a go
 I certainly wrote you at Baden
 Dear me that was six months ago

 I got all your outlandish letters
 All stamped by some foreign P O
 I handed myself to Miss Mary
 That sketch of a famous chateau
 Tom Saunders is living at Frisco
 They say that he cuts quite a show
 You didnt meet Euchredeck Billy
 Anywhere on your road to Cairo

 So you thought of the rusty old cabin
 The pines and the valley below
 And heard the North Fork of the Yuba
 As you stood on the banks of the Po
 Twas just like your romance old fellow
 But now there is standing a row
 Of stores on the site of the cabin
 That you lived in a twelvemonth ago

 But its jolly to see you old fellow
 To think its a twelvemonth ago
 And you have seen Louis Napoleon
 And look like a Johnny Crapaud
 Come in You will surely see Mary
 You know we are married What no
 Oh ay I forgot there was something
 Between you a twelvemonth ago




FURTHER LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES

 NYES FORD STANISLAUS 1870

 Do I sleep do I dream
 Do I wonder and doubt
 Are things what they seem
 Or is visions about
 Is our civilization a failure
 Or is the Caucasian played out

 Which expressions are strong
 Yet would feebly imply
 Some account of a wrong
 Not to call it a lie
 As was worked off on William my pardner
 And the same being W Nye

 He came down to the Ford
 On the very same day
 Of that lottery drawed
 By those sharps at the Bay
 And he says to me Truthful how goes it
 I replied It is far far from gay

 For the camp has gone wild
 On this lottery game
 And has even beguiled
 Injin Dick by the same
 Then said Nye to me Injins is pizen
 But what is his number eh James

 I replied 7 2
 9 8 4 is his hand
 When he started and drew
 Out a list which he scanned
 Then he softly went for his revolver
 With language I cannot command

 Then I said William Nye
 But he turned upon me
 And the look in his eye
 Was quite painful to see
 And he says You mistake this poor Injin
 I protects from such sharps as YOU be

 I was shocked and withdrew
 But I grieve to relate
 When he next met my view
 Injin Dick was his mate
 And the two around town was alying
 In a frightfully dissolute state

 Which the war dance they had
 Round a tree at the Bend
 Was a sight that was sad
 And it seemed that the end
 Would not justify the proceedings
 As I quiet remarked to a friend

 For that Injin he fled
 The next day to his band
 And we found William spread
 Very loose on the strand
 With a peacefullike smile on his features
 And a dollar greenback in his hand

 Which the same when rolled out
 We observed with surprise
 Was what he no doubt
 Thought the number and prize
 Them figures in red in the corner
 Which the number of notes specifies

 Was it guile or a dream
 Is it Nye that I doubt
 Are things what they seem
 Or is visions about
 Is our civilization a failure
 Or is the Caucasian played out

THE GHOST THAT JIM SAW

 Why as to that said the engineer
 Ghosts aint things we are apt to fear
 Spirits dont fool with levers much
 And throttlevalves dont take to such
 And as for Jim
 What happened to him
 Was one half fact and tother half whim

 Running one night on the line he saw
 A houseas plain as the moral law
 Just by the moonlit bank and thence
 Came a drunken man with no more sense
 Than to drop on the rail
 Flat as a flail
 As Jim drove by with the midnight mail

 Down went the patentssteam reversed
 Too late for there came a thud Jim cursed
 As the fireman there in the cab with him
 Kinder stared in the face of Jim
 And says What now
 Says Jim What now
 Ive just run over a manthats how

 The fireman stared at Jim They ran
 Back but they never found house nor man
 Nary a shadow within a mile
 Jim turned pale but he tried to smile
 Then on he tore
 Ten mile or more
 In quicker time than hed made afore

 Would you believe it the very next night
 Up rose that house in the moonlight white
 Out comes the chap and drops as before
 Down goes the brake and the rest encore
 And so in fact
 Each night that act
 Occurred till folks swore Jim was cracked

 Humph let me see its a year now most
 That I met Jim East and says Hows your ghost
 Gone says Jim and more its plain
 That ghost dont trouble me again
 I thought I shook
 That ghost when I took
 A place on an Eastern linebut look

 What should I meet the first trip out
 But the very house we talked about
 And the selfsame man Well says I I guess
 Its time to stop this yer foolishness
 So I crammed on steam
 When there came a scream
 From my fireman that jest broke my dream

 Youve killed somebody Says I Not much
 Ive been thar often and thar aint no such
 And now Ill prove it Back we ran
 Anddarn my skinbut thar WAS a man
 On the rail dead
 Smashed in the head
 Now I call that meanness Thats all Jim said

THE STAGEDRIVERS STORY

 It was the stagedrivers story as he stood with his back to the
 wheelers
 Quietly flecking his whip and turning his quid of tobacco
 While on the dusty road and blent with the rays of the moonlight
 We saw the long curl of his lash and the juice of tobacco descending

 Danger Sir I believe youindeed I may say on that subject
 You your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager
 I have seen danger Oh no not me sir indeed I assure you
 Twas only the man with the dog that is sitting alone in yon wagon

 It was the Geiger Grade a mile and a half from the summit
 Black as your hat was the night and never a star in the heavens
 Thundering down the grade the gravel and stones we sent flying
 Over the precipice sidea thousand feet plumb to the bottom

 Halfway down the grade I felt sir a thrilling and creaking
 Then a lurch to one side as we hung on the bank of the canyon
 Then looking up the road I saw in the distance behind me
 The off hind wheel of the coach just loosed from its axle and
 following

 One glance alone I gave then gathered together my ribbons
 Shouted and flung them outspread on the straining necks of my
 cattle
 Screamed at the top of my voice and lashed the air in my frenzy
 While down the Geiger Grade on THREE wheels the vehicle thundered

 Speed was our only chance when again came the ominous rattle
 Crack and another wheel slipped away and was lost in the darkness
 TWO only now were left yet such was our fearful momentum
 Upright erect and sustained on TWO wheels the vehicle thundered

 As some huge boulder unloosed from its rocky shelf on the mountain
 Drives before it the hare and the timorous squirrel far leaping
 So down the Geiger Grade rushed the Pioneer coach and before it
 Leaped the wild horses and shrieked in advance of the danger
 impending

 But to be brief in my tale Again ere we came to the level
 Slipped from its axle a wheel so that to be plain in my statement
 A matter of twelve hundred yards or more as the distance may be
 We traveled upon ONE wheel until we drove up to the station

 Then sir we sank in a heap but picking myself from the ruins
 I heard a noise up the grade and looking I saw in the distance
 The three wheels following still like moons on the horizon whirling
 Till circling they gracefully sank on the road at the side of the
 station

 This is my story sir a trifle indeed I assure you
 Much more perchance might be saidbut I hold him of all men most
 lightly
 Who swerves from the truth in his tale No thank you Well since
 you ARE pressing
 Perhaps I dont care if I do you may give me the same Jimno
 sugar




A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

 REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES

 It was Andrew Jackson Sutter who despising Mr Cutter for remarks
 he heard him utter in debate upon the floor
 Swung him up into the skylight in the peaceful pensive twilight
 and then keerlessly proceeded makin no account what WE did
 To wipe up with his person casual dust upon the floor

 Now a square fight never frets me nor unpleasantness upsets me but
 the simple thing that gets menow the job is done and gone
 And weve come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery
 leavin Cutter there with Sutterthat mebbee just a stutter
 On the part of Mr Cutter caused the loss we deeply mourn

 Some bashful hesitation just like spellin punctooationmight have
 worked an aggravation on to Sutters mournful mind
 For the witnesses all vary ez to wot was said and nary a galoot will
 toot his horn except the way he is inclined

 But they all allow that Sutter had begun a kind of mutter when
 uprose Mr Cutter with a sickening kind of ease
 And proceeded then to wade in to the subject then prevadin Is
 Profanity degradin in words like unto these

 Onlike the previous speaker Mr Sutter of Yreka he was but a
 humble seekerand not like hima cuss
 It was here that Mr Sutter softly reached for Mr Cutter when the
 latter with a stutter said accustomed to discuss

 Then Sutter he rose grimly and sorter smilin dimly bowed onto the
 Chairman primlyjust like Cutter ez could be
 Drawled he guessed he must fallbackasMr Cutter owned the
 packashe just had played theJackas here Cutters gun
 went crack as Mr Sutter gasped and ended every man can see

 But William Henry Pryorjust in range of Sutters firehere
 evinced a wild desire to do somebody harm
 And in the general scrimmage no one thought if Sutters image was
 a misplaced punctooationlike the hole in Pryors arm

 For we all waltzed in together never carin to ask whether it was
 Sutter or was Cutter we woz tryin to abate
 But we couldnt help perceivin when we took to inkstand heavin
 that the process was relievin to the sharpness of debate

 So weve come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery and I
 make no commentary on these simple childish games
 Things is various and humanand the man aint born of woman who is
 free to intermeddle with his pals intents and aims




THE THOUGHTREADER OF ANGELS

 REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES

 We hev tumbled ez dust
 Or ez worms of the yearth
 Wot we looked for hez bust
 We are objects of mirth
 They have played usold Pards of the riverthey hev played us for
 all we was worth

 Was it euchre or draw
 Cut us off in our bloom
 Was it faro whose law
 Is uncertain ez doom
 Or an innocent Jack pot thatopenedwas to us ez the jaws of the
 tomb

 It was nary It kem
 With some sharps from the States
 Ez folks sez All things kem
 To the fellers ez waits
 And wed waited six months for that suthinhad me and Bill Nyein
 such straits

 And it kem It was small
 It was dreamlike and weak
 It wore store clothesthats all
 That we knew so to speak
 But it called itself Billson ThoughtReaderwhich aint half a
 name for its cheek

 He could read wot you thought
 And he knew wot you did
 He could find things untaught
 No matter whar hid
 And he went to it blindfold and smiling being led by the hand like
 a kid

 Then I glanced at Bill Nye
 And I sez without pride
 Youll excuse US Weve nigh
 On to nothin to hide
 But if some gent will lend us a twenty well hide it whar folks
 shall decide

 It was Billsons own self
 Who forked over the gold
 With a smile Thars the pelf
 He remarked I make bold
 To advance it and go twenty better that Ill find it without being
 told

 Then I passed it to Nye
 Who repassed it to me
 And we bandaged each eye
 Of that Billsonez we
 Softly dropped that coin in his coat pocket ez the hull crowd
 around us could see

 That was all Hed one hand
 Locked in mine Then he groped
 We could not understand
 Why that minit Nye sloped
 For we knew wed the dead thing on Billsoneven more than we
 dreamed of or hoped

 For he stood thar in doubt
 With his hand to his head
 Then he turned and lit out
 Through the door where Nye fled
 Draggin me and the rest of us arter while we larfed till we
 thought we was dead

 Till he overtook Nye
 And went through him Words fail
 For what follers Kin I
 Paint our agonized wail
 Ez he drew from Nyes pocket that twenty wot we sworn was in his own
 coattail

 And it WAS But when found
 It proved bogus and brass
 And the question goes round
 How the thing kem to pass
 Or if PASSED woz it passed thar by William and I listens and
 echoes Alas

 For the days when the skill
 Of the keerds was no blind
 When no effort of will
 Could beat four of a kind
 When the thing wot you held in your hand Pard was worth more than
 the thing in your mind




THE SPELLING BEE AT ANGELS

 REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES

 Waltz in waltz in ye little kids and gather round my knee
 And drop them books and first pothooks and hear a yarn from me
 I kin not sling a fairy tale of Jinnys fierce and wild
 For I hold it is unchristian to deceive a simple child
 But as from school yer driftin by I thowt yed like to hear
 Of a Spelling Bee at Angels that we organized last year

 It warnt made up of gentle kids of pretty kids like you
 But gents ez hed their reglar growth and some enough for two
 There woz Lanky Jim of Sutters Fork and Bilson of Lagrange
 And Pistol Bob who wore that day a knife by way of change
 You start you little kids you think these are not pretty names
 But each had a man behind it andmy name is Truthful James

 There was Poker Dick from Whisky Flat and Smith of Shooters Bend
 And Brown of Calaveraswhich I want no better friend
 Threefingered Jackyes pretty dears three fingersYOU have five
 Clapp cut off twoits singlar too that Clapp aint now alive
 Twas very wrong indeed my dears and Clapp was much to blame
 Likewise was Jack in afteryears for shootin of that same

 The nights was kinder lengthenin out the rains had jest begun
 When all the camp came up to Petes to have their usual fun
 But we all sot kinder sadlike around the barroom stove
 Till Smith got up permiskisslike and this remark he hove
 Thars a new game down in Frisco that ez far ez I can see
 Beats euchre poker and vantoon they calls the Spellin Bee

 Then Brown of Calaveras simply hitched his chair and spake
 Poker is good enough for me and Lanky Jim sez Shake
 And Bob allowed he warnt proud but he must say right thar
 That the man who tackled euchre hed his education squar
 This brought up Lenny Fairchild the schoolmaster who said
 He knew the game and he would give instructions on that head

 For instance take some simple word sez he like separate
 Now who can spell it Dog my skin ef thar was one in eight
 This set the boys all wild at once The chairs was put in row
 And at the head was Lanky Jim and at the foot was Joe
 And high upon the bar itself the schoolmaster was raised
 And the barkeep put his glasses down and sat and silent gazed

 The first word out was parallel and seven let it be
 Till Joe waltzed in his double l betwixt the a and e
 For since he drilled them Mexicans in San Jacintos fight
 Thar warnt no prouder man got up than Pistol Joe that night
 Till rhythm came He tried to smile then said they had him
 there
 And Lanky Jim with one long stride got up and took his chair

 O little kids my pretty kids twas touchin to survey
 These bearded men with weppings on like schoolboys at their play
 Theyd laugh with glee and shout to see each other lead the van
 And Bob sat up as monitor with a cue for a rattan
 Till the Chair gave out incinerate and Brown said hed be durned
 If any such blamed word as that in school was ever learned

 When phthisis came they all sprang up and vowed the man who rung
 Another blamed Greek word on them be taken out and hung
 As they sat down again I saw in Bilsons eye a flash
 And Brown of Calaveras was atwistin his mustache
 And when at last Brown slipped on gneiss and Bilson took his chair
 He dropped some casual words about some folks who dyed their hair

 And then the Chair grew very white and the Chair said hed adjourn
 But Poker Dick remarked that HE would wait and get his turn
 Then with a tremblin voice and hand and with a wanderin eye
 The Chair next offered eiderduck and Dick began with I
 And Bilson smiledthen Bilson shrieked Just how the fight begun
 I never knowed for Bilson dropped and Dick he moved up one

 Then certain gents arose and said theyd business down in camp
 And ez the road was rather dark and ez the night was damp
 Theydhere got up Threefingered Jack and locked the door and
 yelled
 No not one mothers son goes out till that thar word is spelled
 But while the words were on his lips he groaned and sank in pain
 And sank with Webster on his chest and Worcester on his brain

 Below the bar dodged Poker Dick and tried to look ez he
 Was huntin up authorities thet no one else could see
 And Brown got down behind the stove allowin he was cold
 Till it upsot and down his legs the cinders freely rolled
 And several gents called Order till in his simple way
 Poor Smith began with OrOrand he was dragged away

 O little kids my pretty kids down on your knees and pray
 Youve got your eddication in a peaceful sort of way
 And bear in mind thar may be sharps ez slings their spellin square
 But likewise slings their bowieknives without a thought or care
 You wants to know the rest my dears Thets all In me you see
 The only gent that lived to tell about the Spellin Bee

 

 He ceased and passed that truthful man the children went their way
 With downcast heads and downcast heartsbut not to sport or play
 For when at eve the lamps were lit and supperless to bed
 Each child was sent with tasks undone and lessons all unsaid
 No man might know the awful woe that thrilled their youthful frames
 As they dreamed of Angels Spelling Bee and thought of Truthful James

 Halt Here we are Now wheel your mare a trifle
 Just where you stand then doff your hat and swear
 Never yet was scene you might cover with your rifle
 Half as complete or as marvelously fair

 PHILOSOPHER

 Dropped from Olympus or lifted out of Tempe
 Swung like a censer betwixt the earth and sky
 He who in Greece sang of flocks and flax and hemphe
 Here might recall themsix thousand feet on high

 POET

 Well you may say so The clamor of the river
 Hum of base toil and mans ignoble strife
 Halt far below where the stifling sunbeams quiver
 But never climb to this purer higher life

 Not to this glade where Jones of Mariposa
 Simple and meek as his flocks were looking at
 Tends his soft charge nor where his daughter Rosa
 A shot
 Hallo Whats that

 PHILOSOPHER

 Asomething thro my hat
 Bullet I think You were speaking of his daughter

 POET

 Yes butyour hat you were moving through the leaves
 Likely he thought it some eagle bent on slaughter
 Lightly he shoots A second shot

 PHILOSOPHER

 As one readily perceives
 Still he improves This time YOUR hat has got it
 Quite near the band Eh Oh just as you please
 Stop or go on

 POET

 Perhaps wed better trot it
 Down through the hollow and up among the trees

 BOTH

 Trot trot trot where the bullets cannot follow
 Trot down and up again among the laurel trees

 PHILOSOPHER

 Thanks that is better now of this shotdispensing
 Jones and his girlyou were saying

 POET

 Well you see
 Ihang it allOh whats the use of fencing
 Sir I confess itthese shots were meant for ME

 PHILOSOPHER

 Are you mad

 POET

 God knows I shouldnt wonder
 I love this coy nymph who coldlyas yon peak
 Shines on the river it feeds yet keeps asunder
 Long have I worshiped but never dared to speak

 Till she no doubt her love no longer hiding
 Waked by some chance word her fathers jealousy
 Slips her disdainas an avalanche down gliding
 Sweeps flocks and kin awayto clear a path for ME

 Hence his attack

 PHILOSOPHER

 I see What I admire
 Chiefly I think in your idyl so to speak
 Is the cool modesty that checks your youthful fire
 Absence of selflove and abstinence of cheek

 Still I might mention Ive met the gentle Rosa
 Danced with her thrice to her fathers jealous dread
 And it is possible shes happened to disclose a
 Ahem You can fancy why he shoots at ME instead

 POET

 And heres the father who alone can be the solver

 Shrewdly you question Senor and I fancy
 You are no novice Confess that to little
 Of my poor gossip of Mission and Pueblo
 You are a stranger

 Am I not right Ah believe me that ever
 Since we joined company at the posada
 Ive watched you closely andpardon an old priest
 Ive caught you smiling

 Smiling to hear an old fellow like me talk
 Gossip of pillage and robbers and even
 Air his opinion of law and alcaldes

 By that straight line from the heel to the shoulder
 By that curt speechnay nay no offense son

 Peons and silly vaqueros who dazzled
 By reckless skill and perchance reckless largesse
 Wink at some queer things

 No You would crush THEM as well as the robbers
 Root them out scatter them Ah you are bitter
 And yetquien sabe perhaps thats the one way
 To catch their leader

 As to myself now Id share your displeasure
 For I admit in this Jack of the Tules
 Certain good points He still comes to confession

 Home by a thread Good Again you are smiling
 You have no faith in such shrift and but little
 In priest or penitent

 Bueno We take no offense sir whatever
 It please you to say it becomes us for Church sake
 To bear in peace Yet if you were kinder

IV MISCELLANEOUS




A GREYPORT LEGEND

 1797

 They ran through the streets of the seaport town
 They peered from the decks of the ships that lay
 The cold seafog that came whitening down
 Was never as cold or white as they
 Ho Starbuck and Pinckney and Tenterden
 Run for your shallops gather your men
 Scatter your boats on the lower bay

 Good cause for fear In the thick midday
 The hulk that lay by the rotting pier
 Filled with the children in happy play
 Parted its moorings and drifted clear
 Drifted clear beyond reach or call
 Thirteen children they were in all
 All adrift in the lower bay

 Said a hardfaced skipper God help us all
 She will not float till the turning tide
 Said his wife My darling will hear MY call
 Whether in sea or heaven she bide
 And she lifted a quavering voice and high
 Wild and strange as a seabirds cry
 Till they shuddered and wondered at her side

 The fog drove down on each laboring crew
 Veiled each from each and the sky and shore
 There was not a sound but the breath they drew
 And the lap of water and creak of oar
 And they felt the breath of the downs fresh blown
 Oer leagues of clover and cold gray stone
 But not from the lips that had gone before

 They came no more But they tell the tale
 That when fogs are thick on the harbor reef
 The mackerel fishers shorten sail
 For the signal they know will bring relief
 For the voices of children still at play
 In a phantom hulk that drifts alway
 Through channels whose waters never fail

 It is but a foolish shipmans tale
 A theme for a poets idle page
 But still when the mists of Doubt prevail
 And we lie becalmed by the shores of Age
 We hear from the misty troubled shore
 The voice of the children gone before
 Drawing the soul to its anchorage




A NEWPORT ROMANCE

 They say that she died of a broken heart
 I tell the tale as twas told to me
 But her spirit lives and her soul is part
 Of this sad old house by the sea

 Her lover was fickle and fine and French
 It was nearly a hundred years ago
 When he sailed away from her armspoor wench
 With the Admiral Rochambeau

 I marvel much what periwigged phrase
 Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker
 At what goldlaced speech of those modish days
 She listenedthe mischief take her

 But she kept the posies of mignonette
 That he gave and ever as their bloom failed
 And faded though with her tears still wet
 Her youth with their own exhaled

 Till one night when the seafog wrapped a shroud
 Round spar and spire and tarn and tree
 Her soul went up on that lifted cloud
 From this sad old house by the sea

 And ever since then when the clock strikes two
 She walks unbidden from room to room
 And the air is filled that she passes through
 With a subtle sad perfume

 The delicate odor of mignonette
 The ghost of a deadandgone bouquet
 Is all that tells of her story yet
 Could she think of a sweeter way


 I sit in the sad old house tonight
 Myself a ghost from a farther sea
 And I trust that this Quaker woman might
 In courtesy visit me

 For the laugh is fled from porch and lawn
 And the bugle died from the fort on the hill
 And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone
 And the grand piano is still

 Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two
 And there is no sound in the sad old house
 But the long veranda dripping with dew
 And in the wainscot a mouse

 The light of my studylamp streams out
 From the library door but has gone astray
 In the depths of the darkened hall Small doubt
 But the Quakeress knows the way

 Was it the trick of a sense oerwrought
 With outward watching and inward fret
 But I swear that the air just now was fraught
 With the odor of mignonette

 I open the window and seem almost
 So still lies the oceanto hear the beat
 Of its Great Gulf artery off the coast
 And to bask in its tropic heat

 In my neighbors windows the gaslights flare
 As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss
 And I wonder now could I fit that air
 To the song of this sad old house

 And no odor of mignonette there is
 But the breath of morn on the dewy lawn
 And mayhap from causes as slight as this
 The quaint old legend is born

 But the soul of that subtle sad perfume
 As the spiced embalmings they say outlast
 The mummy laid in his rocky tomb
 Awakens my buried past

 And I think of the passion that shook my youth
 Of its aimless loves and its idle pains
 And am thankful now for the certain truth
 That only the sweet remains

 And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade
 And I see no face at my library door
 For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid
 She is viewless for evermore

 But whether she came as a faint perfume
 Or whether a spirit in stole of white
 I feel as I pass from the darkened room
 She has been with my soul tonight




SAN FRANCISCO

 FROM THE SEA

 Serene indifferent of Fate
 Thou sittest at the Western Gate

 Upon thy height so lately won
 Still slant the banners of the sun

 Thou seest the white seas strike their tents
 O Warder of two continents

 And scornful of the peace that flies
 Thy angry winds and sullen skies

 Thou drawest all things small or great
 To thee beside the Western Gate

 O lions whelp that hidest fast
 In jungle growth of spire and mast

 I know thy cunning and thy greed
 Thy hard high lust and willful deed

 And all thy glory loves to tell
 Of specious gifts material

 Drop down O Fleecy Fog and hide
 Her skeptic sneer and all her pride

 Wrap her O Fog in gown and hood
 Of her Franciscan Brotherhood

 Hide me her faults her sin and blame
 With thy gray mantle cloak her shame

 So shall she cowled sit and pray
 Till morning bears her sins away

 Then rise O Fleecy Fog and raise
 The glory of her coming days

 Be as the cloud that flecks the seas
 Above her smoky argosies

 When forms familiar shall give place
 To stranger speech and newer face

 When all her throes and anxious fears
 Lie hushed in the repose of years

 When Art shall raise and Culture lift
 The sensual joys and meaner thrift

 And all fulfilled the vision we
 Who watch and wait shall never see

 Who in the morning of her race
 Toiled fair or meanly in our place

 But yielding to the common lot
 Lie unrecorded and forgot




THE MOUNTAIN HEARTSEASE

 By scattered rocks and turbid waters shifting
 By furrowed glade and dell
 To feverish men thy calm sweet face uplifting
 Thou stayest them to tell

 The delicate thought that cannot find expression
 For ruder speech too fair
 That like thy petals trembles in possession
 And scatters on the air

 The miner pauses in his rugged labor
 And leaning on his spade
 Laughingly calls unto his comradeneighbor
 To see thy charms displayed

 But in his eyes a mist unwonted rises
 And for a moment clear
 Some sweet home face his foolish thought surprises
 And passes in a tear

 Some boyish vision of his Eastern village
 Of uneventful toil
 Where golden harvests followed quiet tillage
 Above a peaceful soil

 One moment only for the pick uplifting
 Through root and fibre cleaves
 And on the muddy current slowly drifting
 Are swept by bruised leaves

 And yet O poet in thy homely fashion
 Thy work thou dost fulfill
 For on the turbid current of his passion
 Thy face is shining still




GRIZZLY

 Cowardof heroic size
 In whose lazy muscles lies
 Strength we fear and yet despise
 Savagewhose relentless tusks
 Are content with acorn husks
 Robberwhose exploits neer soared
 Oer the bees or squirrels hoard
 Whiskered chin and feeble nose
 Claws of steel on baby toes
 Here in solitude and shade
 Shambling shuffling plantigrade
 Be thy courses undismayed

 Here where Nature makes thy bed
 Let thy rude halfhuman tread
 Point to hidden Indian springs
 Lost in ferns and fragrant grasses
 Hovered oer by timid wings
 Where the woodduck lightly passes
 Where the wild bee holds her sweets
 Epicurean retreats
 Fit for thee and better than
 Fearful spoils of dangerous man
 In thy fatjowled deviltry
 Friar Tuck shall live in thee
 Thou mayst levy tithe and dole
 Thou shalt spread the woodland cheer
 From the pilgrim taking toll
 Match thy cunning with his fear
 Eat and drink and have thy fill
 Yet remain an outlaw still




MADRONO

 Captain of the Western wood
 Thou that apest Robin Hood
 Green above thy scarlet hose
 How thy velvet mantle shows
 Never tree like thee arrayed
 O thou gallant of the glade

 When the fervid August sun
 Scorches all it looks upon
 And the balsam of the pine
 Drips from stem to needle fine
 Round thy compact shade arranged
 Not a leaf of thee is changed

 When the yellow autumn sun
 Saddens all it looks upon
 Spreads its sackcloth on the hills
 Strews its ashes in the rills
 Thou thy scarlet hose dost doff
 And in limbs of purest buff
 Challengest the sombre glade
 For a sylvan masquerade

 Where oh where shall he begin
 Who would paint thee Harlequin
 With thy waxen burnished leaf
 With thy branches red relief
 With thy polytinted fruit
 In thy spring or autumn suit
 Where begin and oh where end
 Thou whose charms all art transcend




COYOTE

 Blown out of the prairie in twilight and dew
 Half bold and half timid yet lazy all through
 Loath ever to leave and yet fearful to stay
 He limps in the clearing an outcast in gray

 A shade on the stubble a ghost by the wall
 Now leaping now limping now risking a fall
 Lopeared and largejointed but ever alway
 A thoroughly vagabond outcast in gray

 Here Carlo old fellowhes one of your kind
 Go seek him and bring him in out of the wind
 What snarling my Carlo So even dogs may
 Deny their own kin in the outcast in gray

 Well take what you willthough it be on the sly
 Marauding or beggingI shall not ask why
 But will call it a dole just to help on his way
 A fourfooted friar in orders of gray




TO A SEABIRD

 SANTA CRUZ 1869

 Sauntering hither on listless wings
 Careless vagabond of the sea
 Little thou heedest the surf that sings
 The bar that thunders the shale that rings
 Give me to keep thy company

 Little thou hast old friend thats new
 Storms and wrecks are old things to thee
 Sick am I of these changes too
 Little to care for little to rue
 I on the shore and thou on the sea

 All of thy wanderings far and near
 Bring thee at last to shore and me
 All of my journeyings end them here
 This our tether must be our cheer
 I on the shore and thou on the sea

 Lazily rocking on oceans breast
 Something in common old friend have we
 Thou on the shingle seekst thy nest
 I to the waters look for rest
 I on the shore and thou on the sea




WHAT THE CHIMNEY SANG

 Over the chimney the nightwind sang
 And chanted a melody no one knew
 And the Woman stopped as her babe she tossed
 And thought of the one she had long since lost
 And said as her teardrops back she forced
 I hate the wind in the chimney

 Over the chimney the nightwind sang
 And chanted a melody no one knew
 And the Children said as they closer drew
 Tis some witch that is cleaving the black night through
 Tis a fairy trumpet that just then blew
 And we fear the wind in the chimney

 Over the chimney the nightwind sang
 And chanted a melody no one knew
 And the Man as he sat on his hearth below
 Said to himself It will surely snow
 And fuel is dear and wages low
 And Ill stop the leak in the chimney

 Over the chimney the nightwind sang
 And chanted a melody no one knew
 But the Poet listened and smiled for he
 Was Man and Woman and Child all three
 And said It is Gods own harmony
 This wind we hear in the chimney




DICKENS IN CAMP

 Above the pines the moon was slowly drifting
 The river sang below
 The dim Sierras far beyond uplifting
 Their minarets of snow

 The roaring campfire with rude humor painted
 The ruddy tints of health
 On haggard face and form that drooped and fainted
 In the fierce race for wealth

 Till one arose and from his packs scant treasure
 A hoarded volume drew
 And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure
 To hear the tale anew

 And then while round them shadows gathered faster
 And as the firelight fell
 He read aloud the book wherein the Master
 Had writ of Little Nell

 Perhaps twas boyish fancyfor the reader
 Was youngest of them all
 But as he read from clustering pine and cedar
 A silence seemed to fall

 The firtrees gathering closer in the shadows
 Listened in every spray
 While the whole camp with Nell on English meadows
 Wandered and lost their way

 And so in mountain solitudesoertaken
 As by some spell divine
 Their cares dropped from them like the needles shaken
 From out the gusty pine

 Lost is that camp and wasted all its fire
 And he who wrought that spell
 Ah towering pine and stately Kentish spire
 Ye have one tale to tell

 Lost is that camp but let its fragrant story
 Blend with the breath that thrills
 With hopvines incense all the pensive glory
 That fills the Kentish hills

 And on that grave where English oak and holly
 And laurel wreaths entwine
 Deem it not all a too presumptuous folly
 This spray of Western pine

 July 1870




TWENTY YEARS

 Beg your pardon old fellow I think
 I was dreaming just now when you spoke
 The fact is the musical clink
 Of the ice on your winegoblets brink
 A chord of my memory woke

 And I stood in the pasturefield where
 Twenty summers ago I had stood
 And I heard in that sound I declare
 The clinking of bells in the air
 Of the cows coming home from the wood

 Then the applebloom shook on the hill
 And the mulleinstalks tilted each lance
 And the sun behind Rapalyes mill
 Was my uttermost West and could thrill
 Like some fanciful land of romance

 Then my friend was a hero and then
 My girl was an angel In fine
 I drank buttermilk for at ten
 Faith asks less to aid her than when
 At thirty we doubt over wine

 Ah well it DOES seem that I must
 Have been dreaming just now when you spoke
 Or lost very like in the dust
 Of the years that slow fashioned the crust
 On that bottle whose seal you last broke

 Twenty years was its age did you say
 Twenty years Ah my friend it is true
 All the dreams that have flown since that day
 All the hopes in that time passed away
 Old friend Ive been drinking with you




FATE

 The sky is clouded the rocks are bare
 The spray of the tempest is white in air
 The winds are out with the waves at play
 And I shall not tempt the sea today

 The trail is narrow the wood is dim
 The panther clings to the arching limb
 And the lions whelps are abroad at play
 And I shall not join in the chase today

 But the ship sailed safely over the sea
 And the hunters came from the chase in glee
 And the town that was builded upon a rock
 Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock




GRANDMOTHER TENTERDEN

 MASSACHUSETTS SHORE 1800

 I mind it was but yesterday
 The sun was dim the air was chill
 Below the town below the hill
 The sails of my sons ship did fill
 My Jacob who was cast away

 He said God keep you mother dear
 But did not turn to kiss his wife
 They had some foolish idle strife
 Her tongue was like a twoedged knife
 And he was proud as any peer

 Howbeit that night I took no note
 Of sea nor sky for all was drear
 I marked not that the hills looked near
 Nor that the moon though curved and clear
 Through curdlike scud did drive and float

 For with my darling went the joy
 Of autumn woods and meadows brown
 I came to hate the little town
 It seemed as if the sun went down
 With him my only darling boy

 It was the middle of the night
 The wind it shifted westbysouth
 It piled high up the harbor mouth
 The marshes black with summer drouth
 Were all abroad with seafoam white

 It was the middle of the night
 The sea upon the garden leapt
 And my sons wife in quiet slept
 And I his mother waked and wept
 When lo there came a sudden light

 And there he stood His seamans dress
 All wet and dripping seemed to be
 The pale blue fires of the sea
 Dripped from his garments constantly
 I could not speak through cowardness

 I come through night and storm he said
 Through storm and night and death said he
 To kiss my wife if it so be
 That strife still holds twixt her and me
 For all beyond is peace he said

 The sea is His and He who sent
 The wind and wave can soothe their strife
 And brief and foolish is our life
 He stooped and kissed his sleeping wife
 Then sighed and like a dream he went

 Now when my darling kissed not me
 But herhis wifewho did not wake
 My heart within me seemed to break
 I swore a vow nor thenceforth spake
 Of what my clearer eyes did see

 And when the slow weeks brought him not
 Somehow we spake of aught beside
 For sheher hope upheld her pride
 And Iin me all hope had died
 And my son passed as if forgot

 It was about the next springtide
 She pined and faded where she stood
 Yet spake no word of ill or good
 She had the hard cold Edwards blood
 In all her veinsand so she died

 One time I thought before she passed
 To give her peace but ere I spake
 Methought HE will be first to break
 The news in heaven and for his sake
 I held mine back until the last

 And here I sit nor care to roam
 I only wait to hear his call
 I doubt not that this day next fall
 Shall see me safe in port where all
 And every ship at last comes home

 And you have sailed the Spanish Main
 And knew my Jacob Eh Mercy
 Ah God of wisdom hath the sea
 Yielded its dead to humble me
 My boy My Jacob Turn again




GUILDS SIGNAL


 William Guild was engineer of the train which on the 19th of April
 1813 plunged into Meadow Brook on the line of the Stonington and
 Providence Railroad It was his custom as often as he passed his
 home to whistle an Alls well to his wife He was found after
 the disaster dead with his hand on the throttlevalve of his
 engine


 Two low whistles quaint and clear
 That was the signal the engineer
 That was the signal that Guild tis said
 Gave to his wife at Providence
 As through the sleeping town and thence
 Out in the night
 On to the light
 Down past the farms lying white he sped

 As a husbands greeting scant no doubt
 Yet to the woman looking out
 Watching and waiting no serenade
 Lovesong or midnight roundelay
 Said what that whistle seemed to say
 To my trust true
 So love to you
 Working or waiting goodnight it said

 Brisk young bagmen tourists fine
 Old commuters along the line
 Brakemen and porters glanced ahead
 Smiled as the signal sharp intense
 Pierced through the shadows of Providence
 Nothing amiss
 Nothingit is
 Only Guild calling his wife they said

 Summer and winter the old refrain
 Rang oer the billows of ripening grain
 Pierced through the budding boughs oerhead
 Flew down the track when the red leaves burned
 Like living coals from the engine spurned
 Sang as it flew
 To our trust true
 First of all duty Goodnight it said

 And then one night it was heard no more
 From Stonington over Rhode Island shore
 And the folk in Providence smiled and said
 As they turned in their beds The engineer
 Has once forgotten his midnight cheer
 ONE only knew
 To his trust true
 Guild lay under his engine dead




ASPIRING MISS DE LAINE

 A CHEMICAL NARRATIVE

 Certain facts which serve to explain
 The physical charms of Miss Addie De Laine
 Who as the common reports obtain
 Surpassed in complexion the lily and rose
 With a very sweet mouth and a retrousse nose
 A figure like Hebes or that which revolves
 In a milliners window and partially solves
 That question which mentor and moralist pains
 If grace may exist minus feeling or brains

 Of course the young lady had beaux by the score
 All that she wantedwhat girl could ask more
 Lovers that sighed and lovers that swore
 Lovers that danced and lovers that played
 Men of profession of leisure and trade
 But one who was destined to take the high part
 Of holding that mythical treasure her heart
 This lover the wonder and envy of town
 Was a practicing chemist a fellow called Brown

 I might here remark that twas doubted by many
 In regard to the heart if Miss Addie had any
 But no one could look in that eloquent face
 With its exquisite outline and features of grace
 And mark through the transparent skin how the tide
 Ebbed and flowed at the impulse of passion or pride
 None could look who believed in the bloods circulation
 As argued by Harvey but saw confirmation
 That here at least Nature had triumphed oer art
 And as far as complexion went she had a heart

 But this par parenthesis Brown was the man
 Preferred of all others to carry her fan
 Hook her glove drape her shawl and do all that a belle
 May demand of the lover she wants to treat well
 Folks wondered and stared that a fellow called Brown
 Abstracted and solemn in manner a clown
 Ill dressed with a lingering smell of the shop
 Should appear as her escort at party or hop
 Some swore he had cooked up some villainous charm
 Or love philter not in the regular Pharm
 Acopoeia and thus from pure malice prepense
 Had bewitched and bamboozled the young ladys sense
 Others thought with more reason the secret to lie
 In a magical wash or indelible dye
 While Society with its censorious eye
 And judgment impartial stood ready to damn
 What wasnt improper as being a sham

 For a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog
 With a party the finest the season had seen
 To be given in honor of Miss Pollywog
 Who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen
 The guests were invited but one night before
 A carriage drew up at the modest back door
 Of Browns labratory and full in the glare
 Of a big purple bottle some closely veiled fair
 Alighted and entered to make matters plain
 Spite of veils and disguises twas Addie De Laine

 As a bower for true love twas hardly the one
 That a lady would choose to be wooed in or won
 No odor of rose or sweet jessamines sigh
 Breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by
 Nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme
 But the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime
 And salts which your chemist delights to explain
 As the base of the smell of the rose and the drain
 Think of this O ye lovers of sweetness and know
 What you smell when you snuff up Lubin or Pinaud

 I pass by the greetings the transports and bliss
 Which of course duly followed a meeting like this
 And come down to businessfor such the intent
 Of the lady who now oer the crucible leant
 In the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime
 Like a fairy called up in the new pantomime
 And give but her words as she coyly looked down
 In reply to the questioning glances of Brown
 I am taking the drops and am using the paste
 And the little white powders that had a sweet taste
 Which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye
 And the depilatory and also the dye
 And Im charmed with the trial and now my dear Brown
 I have one other favornow ducky dont frown
 Only one for a chemist and genius like you
 But a trifle and one you can easily do
 Now listen tomorrow you know is the night
 Of the birthday soiree of that Pollywog fright
 And Im to be there and the dress I shall wear
 Is TOO lovely but But what then ma chere
 Said Brown as the lady came to a full stop
 And glanced round the shelves of the little back shop
 Well I wantI want something to fill out the skirt
 To the proper dimensions without being girt
 In a stiff crinoline or caged in a hoop
 That shows through ones skirt like the bars of a coop
 Something light that a lady may waltz in or polk
 With a freedom that none but you masculine folk
 Ever know For however poor woman aspires
 Shes always bound down to the earth by these wires
 Are you listening Nonsense dont stare like a spoon
 Idiotic some light thing and spacious and soon
 Something likewell in factsomething like a balloon

 Here she paused and here Brown overcome by surprise
 Gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes
 And the lady departed But just at the door
 Something happenedtis true it had happened before
 In this sanctum of sciencea sibilant sound
 Like some element just from its trammels unbound
 Or two substances that their affinities found

 The night of the anxiously looked for soiree
 Had come with its fair ones in gorgeous array
 With the rattle of wheels and the tinkle of bells
 And the How do ye dos and the Hope you are wells
 And the crush in the passage and last lingering look
 You give as you hang your best hat on the hook
 The rush of hot air as the door opens wide
 And your entrythat blending of selfpossessed pride
 And humility shown in your perfectbred stare
 At the folk as if wondering how they got there
 With other tricks worthy of Vanity Fair
 Meanwhile the safe topic the beat of the room
 Already was losing its freshness and bloom
 Young people were yawning and wondering when
 The dance would come off and why didnt it then
 When a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd
 Lo the door swung its hinges with utterance proud
 And Pompey announced with a trumpetlike strain
 The entrance of Brown and Miss Addie De Laine

 She entered but oh how imperfect the verb
 To express to the senses her movement superb
 To say that she sailed in more clearly might tell
 Her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell
 Her robe was a vague circumambient space
 With shadowy boundaries made of pointlace
 The rest was but guesswork and well might defy
 The power of critical feminine eye
 To define or describe twere as futile to try
 The gossamer web of the cirrus to trace
 Floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky

 Midst the humming of praises and glances of beaux
 That greet our fair maiden wherever she goes
 Brown slipped like a shadow grim silent and black
 With a look of anxiety close in her track
 Once he whispered aside in her delicate ear
 A sentence of warningit might be of fear
 Dont stand in a draught if you value your life
 Nothing moresuch advice might be given your wife
 Or your sweetheart in times of bronchitis and cough
 Without mystery romance or frivolous scoff
 But hark to the music the dance has begun
 The closely draped windows wide open are flung
 The notes of the piccolo joyous and light
 Like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night
 Round about go the dancers in circles they fly
 Trip trip go their feet as their skirts eddy by
 And swifter and lighter but somewhat too plain
 Whisks the fair circumvolving Miss Addie De Laine
 Taglioni and Cerito well might have pined
 For the vigor and ease that her movements combined
 Een Rigelboche never flung higher her robe
 In the naughtiest city thats known on the globe
 Twas amazing twas scandalous lost in surprise
 Some opened their mouths and a few shut their eyes

 But hark At the moment Miss Addie De Laine
 Circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse
 Which brought her fair form to the window again
 From the arms of her partner incautiously slips
 And a shriek fills the air and the music is still
 And the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn
 Still frenziedly points from the wide windowsill
 Into space and the night for Miss Addie was gone
 Gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun
 Gone like the grain when the reaper is done
 Gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass
 Gone without parting farewell and alas
 Gone with a flavor of hydrogen gas

 When the weather is pleasant you frequently meet
 A whiteheaded man slowly pacing the street
 His trembling hand shading his lacklustre eye
 Half blind with continually scanning the sky
 Rumor points him as some astronomical sage
 Reperusing by day the celestial page
 But the reader sagacious will recognize Brown
 Trying vainly to conjure his lost sweetheart down
 And learn the stern moral this story must teach
 That Genius may lift its love out of its reach




A LEGEND OF COLOGNE

 Above the bones
 St Ursula owns
 And those of the virgins she chaperons
 Above the boats
 And the bridge that floats
 And the Rhine and the steamers smoky throats
 Above the chimneys and quainttiled roofs
 Above the clatter of wheels and hoofs
 Above Newmarkets open space
 Above that consecrated place
 Where the genuine bones of the Magi seen are
 And the dozen shops of the real Farina
 Higher than even old Hohestrasse
 Whose houses threaten the timid passer
 Above them all
 Through scaffolds tall
 And spires like delicate limbs in splinters
 The great Colognes
 Cathedral stones
 Climb through the storms of eight hundred winters

 Unfinished there
 In high midair
 The towers halt like a broken prayer
 Through years belated
 Unconsummated
 The hope of its architect quite frustrated
 Its very youth
 They say forsooth
 With a quite improper purpose mated
 And every stone
 With a curse of its own
 Instead of that sermon Shakespeare stated
 Since the day its choir
 Which all admire
 By Colognes Archbishop was consecrated

 Ah THAT was a day
 One well might say
 To be marked with the largest whitest stone
 To be found in the towers of all Cologne
 Along the Rhine
 From old Rheinstein
 The people flowed like their own good wine
 From Rudesheim
 And Geisenheim
 And every spot that is known to rhyme
 From the famed Cats Castle of St Goarshausen
 To the pictured roofs of Assmannshausen
 And down the track
 From quaint Schwalbach
 To the clustering tiles of Bacharach
 From Bingen hence
 To old Coblentz
 From every castellated crag
 Where the robber chieftains kept their swag
 The folk flowed in and OberCassel
 Shone with the pomp of knight and vassal
 And pouring in from near and far
 As the Rhine to its bosom draws the Ahr
 Or takes the arm of the sober Mosel
 So in Cologne knight squire and losel
 Choked up the citys gates with men
 From old St Stephen to Zint Marjen

 What had they come to see Ah me
 I fear no glitter of pageantry
 Nor sacred zeal
 For Churchs weal
 Nor faith in the virgins bones to heal
 Nor childlike trust in frank confession
 Drew these who dyed in deep transgression
 Still in each nest
 On every crest
 Kept stolen goods in their possession
 But only their gout
 For something new
 More rare than the roast of a wandering Jew
 Orto be exact
 To seein fact
 A Christian soul in the very act
 Of being damned secundum artem
 By the devil before a soul could part em

 For a rumor had flown
 Throughout Cologne
 That the church in fact was the devils own
 That its architect
 Being long suspect
 Had confessed to the Bishop that he had wrecked
 Not only his OWN soul but had lost
 The VERY FIRST CHRISTIAN SOUL that crossed
 The sacred threshold and all in fine
 For that very beautiful design
 Of the wonderful choir
 They were pleased to admire
 And really he must be allowed to say
 To speak in a purely business way
 That taking the ruling market prices
 Of souls and churches in such a crisis
 It would be shown
 And his Grace must own
 It was really a BARGAIN for Cologne

 Such was the tale
 That turned cheeks pale
 With the thought that the enemy might prevail
 And the church doors snap
 With a thunderclap
 On a Christian soul in that devils trap
 But a wiser few
 Who thought that they knew
 Colognes Archbishop replied Pooh pooh
 Just watch him and wait
 And as sure as fate
 Youll find that the Bishop will give checkmate

 One here might note
 How the popular vote
 As shown in all legends and anecdote
 Declares that a breach
 Of trust to oerreach
 The devil is something quite proper for each
 And really if you
 Give the devil his due
 In spite of the proverbits something youll rue
 But to lie and deceive him
 To use and to leave him
 From Job up to Faust is the way to receive him
 Though no one has heard
 It ever averred
 That the Father of Lies ever yet broke HIS word
 But has left this position
 In every tradition
 To be taken alone by the truthloving Christian
 Bom from the tower
 It is the hour
 The host pours in in its pomp and power
 Of banners and pyx
 And high crucifix
 And crosiers and other processional sticks
 And no end of Marys
 In quaint reliquaries
 To gladden the souls of all true antiquaries
 And an Osculum Pacis
 A myth to the masses
 Who trusted their bones more to mail and cuirasses
 All borne by the throng
 Who are marching along
 To the square of the Dom with processional song
 With the flaring of dips
 And bending of hips
 And the chanting of hundred perfunctory lips
 And some good little boys
 Who had come up from Neuss
 And the Quirinuskirche to show off their voice
 All march to the square
 Of the great Dom and there
 File right and left leaving alone and quite bare
 A covered sedan
 Containingso ran
 The rumorthe victim to take off the ban

 They have left it alone
 They have sprinkled each stone
 Of the porch with a sanctified Eau de Cologne
 Guaranteed in this case
 To disguise every trace
 Of a sulphurous presence in that sacred place
 Two Carmelites stand
 On the right and left hand
 Of the covered sedan chair to wait the command
 Of the prelate to throw
 Up the cover and show
 The form of the victim in terror below
 Theres a pause and a prayer
 Then the signal and there
 Is a WOMANby all that is good and is fair

 A woman and known
 To them allone must own
 TOO WELL KNOWN to the many today to be shown
 As a martyr or een
 As a Christian A queen
 Of pleasance and revel of glitter and sheen
 So bad that the worst
 Of Cologne spake up first
 And declared twas an outrage to suffer one curst
 And already a fief
 Of the Satanic chief
 To martyr herself for the Churchs relief
 But in vain fell their sneer
 On the mob who I fear
 On the whole felt a strong disposition to cheer

 A woman and there
 She stands in the glare
 Of the pitiless sun and their pitying stare
 A woman still young
 With garments that clung
 To a figure though wasted with passion and wrung
 With remorse and despair
 Yet still passing fair
 With jewels and gold in her dark shining hair
 And cheeks that are faint
 Neath her dyes and her paint
 A woman most surelybut hardly a saint

 She moves She has gone
 From their pity and scorn
 She has mounted alone
 The first step of stone
 And the high swinging doors she wide open has thrown
 Then pauses and turns
 As the altar blaze burns
 On her cheeks and with one sudden gesture she spurns
 Archbishop and Prior
 Knight ladye and friar
 And her voice rings out high from the vault of the choir

 O men of Cologne
 What I WAS ye have known
 What I AM as I stand here One knoweth alone
 If it be but His will
 I shall pass from Him still
 Lost curst and degraded I reckon no ill
 If still by that sign
 Of His anger divine
 One soul shall be saved He hath blessed more than mine
 O men of Cologne
 Stand forth if ye own
 A faith like to this or more fit to atone
 And take ye my place
 And God give you grace
 To stand and confront Him like me face to face

 She paused Yet aloof
 They all stand No reproof
 Breaks the silence that fills the celestial roof
 One instantno more
 She halts at the door
 Then enters A flood from the roof to the floor
 Fills the church rosy red
 She is gone
 But instead
 Who is this leaning forward with glorified head
 And hands stretched to save
 Sure this is no slave
 Of the Powers of Darkness with aspect so brave

 They press to the door
 But too late All is oer
 Naught remains but a womans form prone on the floor
 But they still see a trace
 Of that glow in her face
 That they saw in the light of the altars high blaze
 On the image that stands
 With the babe in its hands
 Enshrined in the churches of all Christian lands

 A Te Deum sung
 A censer high swung
 With praise benediction and incense wideflung
 Proclaim that the CURSE
 IS REMOVEDand no worse
 Is the Dom for the trialin fact the REVERSE
 For instead of their losing
 A soul in abusing
 The Evil Ones faith they gained one of his choosing

 Thus the legend is told
 You will find in the old
 Vaulted aisles of the Dom stiff in marble or cold
 In iron and brass
 In gown and cuirass
 The knights priests and bishops who came to that Mass
 And high oer the rest
 With her babe at her breast
 The image of Mary Madonna the blest
 But you look round in vain
 On each high pictured pane
 For the woman most worthy to walk in her train

 Yet standing today
 Oer the dust and the clay
 Midst the ghosts of a life that has long passed away
 With the slowsinking sun
 Looking softly upon
 That stainedglass procession I scarce miss the one
 That it does not reveal
 For I know and I feel
 That these are but shadowsthe woman was real




THE TALE OF A PONY

 Name of my heroine simply Rose
 Surname tolerable only in prose
 Habitat Paristhat is where
 She resided for change of air
 Aetat twenty complexion fair
 Rich good looking and debonnaire
 Smarter than Jersey lightning There
 Thats her photograph done with care

 In Paris whatever they do besides
 EVERY LADY IN FULL DRESS RIDES
 Moire antiques you never meet
 Sweeping the filth of a dirty street
 But every womans claim to ton
 Depends upon
 The team she drives whether phaeton
 Landau or britzka Hence its plain
 That Rose who was of her toilet vain
 Should have a team that ought to be
 Equal to any in all Paris

 Bring forth the horse The commissaire
 Bowed and brought Miss Rose a pair
 Leading an equipage rich and rare
 Why doth that lovely lady stare
 Why The tail of the off gray mare
 Is bobbed by all thats good and fair
 Like the shavingbrushes that soldiers wear
 Scarcely showing as much back hair
 As Tam OShanters Megand there
 Lord knows shed little enough to spare

 That stare and frown the Frenchman knew
 But did as wellbred Frenchmen do
 Raised his shoulders above his crown
 Joined his thumbs with the fingers down
 And said Ah Heaventhen Mademoiselle
 Delay one minute and all is well
 He wentreturned by what good chance
 These things are managed so well in France
 I cannot say but he made the sale
 And the bobtailed mare had a flowing tail

 All that is false in this world below
 Betrays itself in a love of show
 Indignant Nature hides her lash
 In the purpleblack of a dyed mustache
 The shallowest fop will trip in French
 The wouldbe critic will misquote Trench
 In short youre always sure to detect
 A sham in the things folks most affect
 Beanpods are noisiest when dry
 And you always wink with your weakest eye
 And thats the reason the old gray mare
 Forever had her tail in the air
 With flourishes beyond compare
 Though every whisk
 Incurred the risk
 Of leaving that sensitive region bare
 She did some things that you couldnt but feel
 She wouldnt have done had her tail been real

 Champs Elysees time past five
 There go the carriageslook alive
 Everything that man can drive
 Or his inventive skill contrive
 Yankee buggy or English chay
 Dogcart droschky and smart coupe
 A desobligeante quite bulky
 French idea of a Yankee sulky
 Band in the distance playing a march
 Footman standing stiff as starch
 Savans lorettes deputies Arch
 Bishops and there together range
 Souslieutenants and centgardes strange
 Way these soldierchaps make change
 Mixed with blackeyed Polish dames
 With unpronounceable awful names
 Laces tremble and ribbons flout
 Coachmen wrangle and gendarmes shout
 Bless us what is the row about
 Ah here comes Rosys new turnout
 Smart You bet your life twas that
 Nifty short for magnificat
 Mulberry panelsheraldic spread
 Ebony wheels picked out with red
 And two gray mares that were thoroughbred
 No wonder that every dandys head
 Was turned by the turnoutand twas said
 That Caskowhisky friend of the Czar
 A very good whip as Russians are
 Was tied to Rosys triumphal car
 Entranced the reader will understand
 By ribbons that graced her head and hand

 Alas the hour you think would crown
 Your highest wishes should let you down
 Or Fate should turn by your own mischance
 Your victors car to an ambulance
 From cloudless heavens her lightnings glance
 And these things happen even in France
 And so Miss Rose as she trotted by
 The cynosure of every eye
 Saw to her horror the off mare shy
 Flourish her tail so exceedingly high
 That disregarding the closest tie
 And without giving a reason why
 She flung that tail so free and frisky
 Off in the face of Caskowhisky

 Excuses blushes smiles in fine
 End of the ponys tail and mine




ON A CONE OF THE BIG TREES

 SEQUOIA GIGANTEA

 Brown foundling of the Western wood
 Babe of primeval wildernesses
 Long on my table thou hast stood
 Encounters strange and rude caresses
 Perchance contented with thy lot
 Surroundings new and curious faces
 As though ten centuries were not
 Imprisoned in thy shining cases

 Thou bringst me back the halcyon days
 Of grateful rest the week of leisure
 The journey lapped in autumn haze
 The sweet fatigue that seemed a pleasure
 The morning ride the noonday halt
 The blazing slopes the red dust rising
 And then the dim brown columned vault
 With its cool damp sepulchral spicing

 Once more I see the rocking masts
 That scrape the sky their only tenant
 The jaybird that in frolic casts
 From some high yard his broad blue pennant
 I see the Indian files that keep
 Their places in the dusty heather
 Their red trunks standing ankledeep
 In moccasins of rusty leather

 I see all this and marvel much
 That thou sweet woodland waif art able
 To keep the company of such
 As throng thy friendsthe poetstable
 The latest spawn the press hath cast
 The modern popes the later Byrons
 Why een the best may not outlast
 Thy poor relationSempervirens

 Thy sire saw the light that shone
 On Mohammeds uplifted crescent
 On many a royal gilded throne
 And deed forgotten in the present
 He saw the age of sacred trees
 And Druid groves and mystic larches
 And saw from forest domes like these
 The builder bring his Gothic arches

 And must thou foundling still forego
 Thy heritage and high ambition
 To lie full lowly and full low
 Adjusted to thy new condition
 Not hidden in the drifted snows
 But under inkdrops idly spattered
 And leaves ephemeral as those
 That on thy woodland tomb were scattered

 Yet lie thou there O friend and speak
 The moral of thy simple story
 Though life is all that thou dost seek
 And age alone thy crown of glory
 Not thine the only germs that fail
 The purpose of their high creation
 If their poor tenements avail
 For worldly show and ostentation




LONE MOUNTAIN

 CEMETERY SAN FRANCISCO

 This is that hill of awe
 That Persian Sindbad saw
 The mount magnetic
 And on its seaward face
 Scattered along its base
 The wrecks prophetic

 Here come the argosies
 Blown by each idle breeze
 To and fro shifting
 Yet to the hill of Fate
 All drawing soon or late
 Day by day drifting

 Drifting forever here
 Barks that for many a year
 Braved wind and weather
 Shallops but yesterday
 Launched on yon shining bay
 Drawn all together

 This is the end of all
 Sun thyself by the wall
 O poorer Hindbad
 Envy not Sindbads fame
 Here come alike the same
 Hindbad and Sindbad

THE TWO SHIPS

 As I stand by the cross on the lone mountains crest
 Looking over the ultimate sea
 In the gloom of the mountain a ship lies at rest
 And one sails away from the lea
 One spreads its white wings on a farreaching track
 With pennant and sheet flowing free
 One hides in the shadow with sails laid aback
 The ship that is waiting for me

 But lo in the distance the clouds break away
 The Gates glowing portals I see
 And I hear from the outgoing ship in the bay
 The song of the sailors in glee
 So I think of the luminous footprints that bore
 The comfort oer dark Galilee
 And wait for the signal to go to the shore
 To the ship that is waiting for me




ADDRESS

 OPENING OF THE CALIFORNIA THEATRE SAN FRANCISCO JANUARY 19 1870

 Brief words when actions wait are well
 The prompters hand is on his bell
 The coming heroes lovers kings
 Are idly lounging at the wings
 Behind the curtains mystic fold
 The glowing future lies unrolled
 And yet one moment for the Past
 One retrospectthe first and last

 The worlds a stage the Master said
 Tonight a mightier truth is read
 Not in the shifting canvas screen
 The flash of gas or tinsel sheen
 Not in the skill whose signal calls
 From empty boards baronial halls
 But fronting sea and curving bay
 Behold the players and the play

 Ah friends beneath your real skies
 The actors shortlived triumph dies
 On that broad stage of empire won
 Whose footlights were the setting sun
 Whose flats a distant background rose
 In trackless peaks of endless snows
 Here genius bows and talent waits
 To copy that but One creates

 Your shifting scenes the league of sand
 An avenue by ocean spanned
 The narrow beach of straggling tents
 A mile of stately monuments
 Your standard lo a flag unfurled
 Whose clinging folds clasp half the world
 This is your drama built on facts
 With twenty years between the acts

 One moment more if here we raise
 The oftsung hymn of local praise
 Before the curtain facts must sway
 HERE waits the moral of your play
 Glassed in the poets thought you view
 What money can yet cannot do
 The faith that soars the deeds that shine
 Above the gold that builds the shrine

 And oh when others take our place
 And Earths green curtain hides our face
 Ere on the stage so silent now
 The last new hero makes his bow
 So may our deeds recalled once more
 In Memorys sweet but brief encore
 Down all the circling ages run
 With the worlds plaudit of Well done




DOLLY VARDEN

 Dear Dolly who does not recall
 The thrilling page that pictured all
 Those charms that held our sense in thrall
 Just as the artist caught her
 As down that English lane she tripped
 In bowered chintz hat sideways tipped
 Trimbodiced brighteyed roguishlipped
 The locksmiths pretty daughter

 Sweet fragment of the Masters art
 O simple faith O rustic heart
 O maid that hath no counterpart
 In lifes dry dogeared pages
 Where shall we find thy like Ah stay
 Methinks I saw her yesterday
 In chintz that flowered as one might say
 Perennial for ages

 Her fathers modest cot was stone
 Five stories high in style and tone
 Composite and I frankly own
 Within its walls revealing
 Some certain novel strange ideas
 A Gothic door with Roman piers
 And floors removed some thousand years
 From their Pompeian ceiling

 The small salon where she received
 Was Louis Quatorze and relieved
 By Chinese cabinets conceived
 Grotesquely by the heathen
 The sofas were a classic sight
 The Roman bench sedilia hight
 The chairs were French in gold and white
 And one Elizabethan

 And she the goddess of that shrine
 Two ringed fingers placed in mine
 The stones were many carats fine
 And of the purest water
 Then dropped a curtsy far enough
 To fairly fill her cretonne puff
 And show the petticoats rich stuff
 That her fond parent bought her

 Her speech was simple as her dress
 Not French the more but English less
 She loved yet sometimes I confess
 I scarce could comprehend her
 Her manners were quite far from shy
 There was a quiet in her eye
 Appalling to the Hugh whod try
 With rudeness to offend her

 But whence I cried this masquerade
 Some figure for tonights charade
 A Watteau shepherdess or maid
 She smiled and begged my pardon
 Why surely you must know the name
 That woman who was Shakespeares flame
 Or Byronswell its all the same
 Why Lord Im Dolly Varden




TELEMACHUS VERSUS MENTOR

 Dont mind me I beg you old fellowIll do very well here alone
 You must not be kept from your German because Ive dropped in like
 a stone
 Leave all ceremony behind you leave all thought of aught but
 yourself
 And leave if you like the Madeira and a dozen cigars on the shelf

 As for me you will say to your hostesswell I scarcely need give
 you a cue
 Chant my praise All will list to Apollo though Mercury pipe to a
 few
 Say just what you please my dear boy theres more eloquence lies
 in youths rash
 Outspoken heartimpulse than ever growled under this grizzling
 mustache

 Go don the dress coat of our tyrantyouths panoplied armor for
 fight
 And tie the white neckcloth that rumples like pleasure and lasts
 but a night
 And pray the Nine Gods to avert you what time the Three Sisters
 shall frown
 And youll lose your highcomedy figure and sit more at ease in
 your gown

 Hes off Theres his foot on the staircase By Jove what a bound
 Really now
 Did I ever leap like this springald with Loves chaplet green on my
 brow
 Was I such an ass No I fancy Indeed I remember quite plain
 A gravity mixed with my transports a cheerfulness softened my pain

 Hes gone Theres the slam of his cab door theres the clatter
 of hoofs and the wheels
 And while he the light toe is tripping in this armchair Ill tilt
 up my heels
 Hes gone and for what For a tremor from a waist like a teetotum
 spun
 For a rosebud thats crumpled by many before it is gathered by one

 Is there naught in the halo of youth but the glow of a passionate
 raceMidst the cheers and applause of a crowdto the goal of a
 beautiful face
 A race that is not to the swift a prize that no merits enforce
 But is won by some faineant youth who shall simply walk over the
 course

 Poor boy shall I shock his conceit When he talks of her cheeks
 loveliness
 Shall I say twas the air of the room and was due to carbonic excess
 That when waltzing she drooped on his breast and the veins of her
 eyelids grew dim
 Twas oxygens absence she felt but never the presence of him

 Shall I tell him first love is a fraud a weakling thats strangled
 in birth
 Recalled with perfunctory tears but lost in unsanctified mirth
 Or shall I go bid him believe in all womankinds charm and forget
 In the light ringing laugh of the world the rattlesnakes gay
 castanet

 Shall I tear out a leaf from my heart from that book that forever
 is shut
 On the past Shall I speak of my first loveAugustamy Lalage
 But
 I forget Was it really Augusta No Twas Lucy No Mary
 No Di
 Never mind they were all first and faithless and yetIve forgotten
 just why

 No no Let him dream on and ever Alas he will waken too soon
 And it doesnt look well for October to always be preaching at June
 Poor boy All his fond foolish trophies pinned yondera bow from
 HER hair
 A few billetsdoux invitations andwhats this My name I
 declare

 Humph Youll come for Ive got you a prize with beauty and money
 no end
 You know her I think twas on dit she once was engaged to your
 friend
 But she says thats all over Ah is it Sweet Ethel incomparable
 maid
 Orwhat if the thing were a trickthis letter so freely displayed

 My opportune presence No nonsense Will nobody answer the bell
 Call a cab Half past ten Not too late yet Oh Ethel Why dont
 you go Well
 Master said you would wait Hang your master Have I ever a
 message to send
 Yes tell him Ive gone to the German to dance with the friend of
 his friend




WHAT THE WOLF REALLY SAID TO LITTLE RED RIDINGHOOD

 Wondering maiden so puzzled and fair
 Why dost thou murmur and ponder and stare
 Why are my eyelids so open and wild
 Only the better to see with my child
 Only the better and clearer to view
 Cheeks that are rosy and eyes that are blue

 Dost thou still wonder and ask why these arms
 Fill thy soft bosom with tender alarms
 Swaying so wickedly Are they misplaced
 Clasping or shielding some delicate waist
 Hands whose coarse sinews may fill you with fear
 Only the better protect you my dear

 Little Red RidingHood when in the street
 Why do I press your small hand when we meet
 Why when you timidly offered your cheek
 Why did I sigh and why didnt I speak
 Why well you seeif the truth must appear
 Im not your grandmother RidingHood dear




HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUPPER

 So shes here your unknown Dulcinea the lady you met on the train
 And you really believe she would know you if you were to meet her
 again

 Of course he replied she would know me there never was
 womankind yet
 Forgot the effect she inspired She excuses but does not forget

 Then you told her your love asked the elder The younger looked
 up with a smile
 I sat by her side half an hourwhat else was I doing the while

 What sit by the side of a woman as fair as the sun in the sky
 And look somewhere else lest the dazzle flash back from your own to
 her eye

 No I hold that the speech of the tongue be as frank and as bold as
 the look
 And I held up herself to herselfthat was more than she got from
 her book

 Young blood laughed the elder no doubt you are voicing the mode
 of ToDay
 But then we old fogies at least gave the lady some chance for delay

 Theres my wife you must knowwe first met on the journey from
 Florence to Rome
 It took me three weeks to discover who was she and where was her home

 Three more to be duly presented three more ere I saw her again
 And a year ere my romance BEGAN where yours ended that day on the
 train

 Oh that was the style of the stagecoach we travel today by
 express
 Forty miles to the hour he answered wont admit of a passion
 thats less

 But what if you make a mistake quoth the elder The younger half
 sighed
 What happens when signals are wrong or switches misplaced he
 replied

 Very well I must bow to your wisdom the elder returned but
 submit
 Your chances of winning this woman your boldness has bettered no whit

 Why you do not at best know her name And what if I try your ideal
 With something if not quite so fair at least more en regle and real

 Let me find you a partner Nay come I insistyou shall follow
 this way
 My dear will you not add your grace to entreat Mr Rapid to stay

 My wife Mr Rapid Eh what Why hes goneyet he said he
 would come
 How rude I dont wonder my dear you are properly crimson and
 dumb




WHAT THE BULLET SANG

 O joy of creation
 To be
 O rapture to fly
 And be free
 Be the battle lost or won
 Though its smoke shall hide the sun
 I shall find my lovethe one
 Born for me

 I shall know him where he stands
 All alone
 With the power in his hands
 Not oerthrown
 I shall know him by his face
 By his godlike front and grace
 I shall hold him for a space
 All my own

 It is heO my love
 So bold
 It is Iall thy love
 Foretold
 It is I O love what bliss
 Dost thou answer to my kiss
 O sweetheart what is this
 Lieth there so cold




THE OLD CAMPFIRE

 Now shift the blanket pad before your saddle back you fling
 And draw your cinch up tighter till the sweat drops from the ring
 Weve a dozen miles to cover ere we reach the next divide
 Our limbs are stiffer now than when we first set out to ride
 And worse the horses know it and feel the leggrip tire
 Since in the days when long ago we sought the old campfire

 Yes twenty years Lord how wed scent its incense down the trail
 Through balm of bay and spice of spruce when eye and ear would fail
 And worn and faint from useless quest we crept like this to rest
 Or flushed with luck and youthful hope we rode like this abreast
 Ay straighten up old friend and let the mustang think hes nigher
 Through looser rein and stirrup strain the welcome old campfire

 You know the shout that would ring out before us down the glade
 And start the blue jays like a flight of arrows through the shade
 And sift the thin pine needles down like slanting shining rain
 And send the squirrels scampering back to their holes again
 Until we saw blueveiled and dim or leaping like desire
 That flame of twenty years ago which lit the old campfire

 And then that rest on Natures breast when talk had dropped and slow
 The night wind went from tree to tree with challenge soft and low
 We lay on lazy elbows propped or stood to stir the flame
 Till up the soaring redwoods shaft our shadows danced and came
 As if to draw us with the sparks high oer its unseen spire
 To the five stars that kept their ward above the old campfire

 Those picket stars whose tranquil watch half soothed half shamed
 our sleep
 What recked we then what beasts or men around might lurk or creep
 We lay and heard with listless ears the faroff panthers cry
 The near coyotes snarling snap the grizzlys deepdrawn sigh
 The brown bears blundering human tread the gray wolves yelping
 choir
 Beyond the magic circle drawn around the old campfire

 And then that morn Was ever morn so filled with all things new
 The light that fell through long brown aisles from out the kindling
 blue
 The creak and yawn of stretching boughs the jaybirds early call
 The rattattat of woodpecker that waked the woodland hall
 The fainter stir of lower life in fern and brake and brier
 Till flashing leaped the torch of Day from last nights old campfire

 Well well well see it once again we should be near it now
 Its scarce a mile to where the trail strikes off to skirt the slough
 And then the dip to Indian Spring the wooded rise andstrange
 Yet here should stand the blasted pine that marked our farther range
 And herewhats this A ragged swab of ruts and stumps and mire
 Sure this is not the sacred grove that hid the old campfire

 Yet heres the blaze I cut myself and theres the stumbling ledge
 With quartz outcrop that lay atop now leveled to its edge
 And mounds of mossgrown stumps beside the woodmans rotting chips
 And gashes in the hillside that gape with dumb red lips
 And yet above the shattered wreck and ruin curling higher
 Ah yesstill lifts the smoke that marked the welcome old campfire

 Perhaps some friend of twenty years still lingers there to raise
 To weary hearts and tired eyes that beacon of old days
 Perhaps but stay tis gone and yet once more it lifts as though
 To meet our tardy blundering steps and seems to MOVE and lo
 Whirls by us in a rush of soundthe vanished funeral pyre
 Of hopes and fears that twenty years burned in the old campfire

 For see beyond the prospect spreads with chimney spire and roof
 Two iron bands across the trail clank to our mustangs hoof
 Above them leap two blackened threads from limblopped tree to tree
 To where the whitewashed station speeds its message to the sea
 Rein in Rein in The quest is oer The goal of our desire
 Is but the train whose track has lain across the old campfire




THE STATIONMASTER OF LONE PRAIRIE

 An empty bench a sky of grayest etching
 A bare bleak shed in blackest silhouette
 Twelve years of platform and before them stretching
 Twelve miles of prairie glimmering through the wet

 North south east westthe same dull gray persistence
 The tattered vapors of a vanished train
 The narrowing rails that meet to pierce the distance
 Or break the columns of the faroff rain

 Naught but myself nor form nor figure breaking
 The long hushed level and stark shining waste
 Nothing that moves to fill the vision aching
 When the last shadow fled in sullen haste

 Nothing beyond Ah yes From out the station
 A stiff gaunt figure thrown against the sky
 Beckoning me with some wooden salutation
 Caught from his signals as the train flashed by

 Yielding me place beside him with dumb gesture
 Born of that reticence of sky and air
 We sit apart yet wrapped in that one vesture
 Of silence sadness and unspoken care

 Each following his own thoughtaround us darkening
 The rainwashed boundaries and stretching track
 Each following those dim parallels and hearkening
 For longlost voices that will not come back

 Until unaskedI knew not why or wherefore
 He yielded bit by bit his dreary past
 Like gathered clouds that seemed to thicken there for
 Some dull downdropping of their care at last

 Long had he lived there As a boy had started
 From the stacked corn the Indians painted face
 Heard the wolves howl the wearying waste that parted
 His fathers hut from the last campingplace

 Nature had mocked him thrice had claimed the reaping
 With scythe of fire of lands she once had sown
 Sent the tornado round his hearthstone heaping
 Rafters dead faces that were like his own

 Then came the War Time When its shadow beckoned
 He had walked dumbly where the flag had led
 Through swamp and fenunknown unpraised unreckoned
 To famine fever and a prison bed

 Till the storm passed and the slow tide returning
 Cast him a wreck beneath his native sky
 Here at his watch gave him the chance of earning
 Scant means to livewho won the right to die

 All this I heardor seemed to hearhalf blending
 With the low murmur of the coming breeze
 The call of some lost bird and the unending
 And tireless sobbing of those grassy seas

 Until at last the spell of desolation
 Broke with a trembling star and faroff cry
 The coming train I glanced around the station
 All was as empty as the upper sky

 Naught but myself nor form nor figure waking
 The long hushed level and stark shining waste
 Naught but myself that cry and the dull shaking
 Of wheel and axle stopped in breathless haste

 Now thenlook sharp Eh what The StationMaster
 THARS NONE We stopped here of our own accord
 The man got killed in that downtrain disaster
 This time last evening Right there All aboard




THE MISSION BELLS OF MONTEREY

 O bells that rang O bells that sang
 Above the martyrs wilderness
 Till from that reddened coastline sprang
 The Gospel seed to cheer and bless
 What are your garnered sheaves today
 O Mission bells Eleison bells
 O Mission bells of Monterey

 O bells that crash O bells that clash
 Above the chimneycrowded plain
 On wall and tower your voices dash
 But never with the old refrain
 In mart and temple gone astray
 Ye dangle bells Ye jangle bells
 Ye wrangle bells of Monterey

 O bells that die so far so nigh
 Come back once more across the sea
 Not with the zealots furious cry
 Not with the creeds austerity
 Come with His love alone to stay
 O Mission bells Eleison bells
 O Mission bells of Monterey


  This poem was set to music by Monsieur Charles Gounod




CROTALUS

 RATTLESNAKE BAR SIERRAS

 No life in earth or air or sky
 The sunbeams broken silently
 On the bared rocks around me lie

 Cold rocks with halfwarmed lichens scarred
 And scales of moss and scarce a yard
 Away one long strip yellowbarred

 Lost in a cleft Tis but a stride
 To reach it thrust its roots aside
 And lift it on thy stick astride

 Yet stay That moment is thy grace
 For round thee thrilling air and space
 A chattering terror fills the place

 A sound as of dry bones that stir
 In the dead Valley By yon fir
 The locust stops its noonday whir

 The wild bird hears smote with the sound
 As if by bullet brought to ground
 On broken wing dips wheeling round

 The hare transfixed with trembling lip
 Halts breathless on pulsating hip
 And palsied tread and heels that slip

 Enough old friendtis thou Forget
 My heedless foot nor longer fret
 The peace with thy grim castanet

 I know thee Yes Thou mayst forego
 That lifted crest the measured blow
 Beyond which thy pride scorns to go

 Or yet retract For me no spell
 Lights those slit orbs where some think dwell
 Machicolated fires of hell

 I only know thee humble bold
 Haughty with miseries untold
 And the old Curse that left thee cold

 And drove thee ever to the sun
 On blistering rocks nor made thee shun
 Our cabins hearth when day was done

 And the spent ashes warmed thee best
 We knew theesilent joyless guest
 Of our rude ingle Een thy quest

 Of the rare milkbowl seemed to be
 Naught but a brothers poverty
 And Spartan taste that kept thee free

 From lust and rapine Thou whose fame
 Searchest the grass with tongue of flame
 Making all creatures seem thy game

 When the whole woods before thee run
 Asked butwhen all was said and done
 To lie untrodden in the sun




ON WILLIAM FRANCIS BARTLETT

 DEAD AT PITTSFIELD MASS 1876

 O poor Romancerthou whose printed page
 Filled with rude speech and ruder forms of strife
 Was given to heroes in whose vulgar rage
 No trace appears of gentler ways and life

 Thou who wast wont of commoner clay to build
 Some rough Achilles or some Ajax tall
 Thou whose free brush too oft was wont to gild
 Some single virtue till it dazzled all

 What right hast thou beside this laureled bier
 Whereon all manhood lieswhereon the wreath
 Of Harvard rests the civic crown and here
 The starry flag and sword and jeweled sheath

 Seest thou these hatchments Knowest thou this blood
 Nourished the heroes of Colonial days
 Sent to the dim and savagehaunted wood
 Those sadeyed Puritans with hymns of praise

 Look round thee Everywhere is classic ground
 There Greylock rears Beside yon silver Bowl
 Great Hawthorne dwelt and in its mirror found
 Those quaint strange shapes that filled his poets soul

 Still silent Stranger Thou who now and then
 Touched the too credulous ear with pathos canst not speak
 Hast lost thy ready skill of tongue and pen
 What Jester Tears upon that painted cheek

 Pardon good friends I am not here to mar
 His laureled wreaths with this poor tinseled crown
 This man who taught me how twas better far
 To be the poem than to write it down

 I bring no lesson Well have others preached
 This sword that dealt full many a gallant blow
 I come once more to touch the hand that reached
 Its knightly gauntlet to the vanquished foe

 O pale Aristocrat that liest there
 So cold so silent Couldst thou not in grace
 Have borne with us still longer and so spare
 The scorn we see in that proud placid face

 Hail and farewell So the proud Roman cried
 Oer his dead hero Hail but not farewell
 With each high thought thou walkest side by side
 We feel thee touch thee know who wrought the spell




THE BIRDS OF CIRENCESTER

 Did I ever tell you my dears the way
 That the birds of CisseterCisseter eh
 Well Cirencesterone OUGHT to say
 From Castra or Caster
 As your Latin master
 Will further explain to you some day
 Though even the wisest err
 And Shakespeare writes Cicester
 While every visitor
 Who doesnt say Cissiter
 Is in Cirencester considered astray

 A hundred miles from London town
 Where the river goes curving and broadening down
 From treetop to spire and spire to mast
 Till it tumbles outright in the Channel at last
 A hundred miles from that flat foreshore
 That the Danes and the Northmen haunt no more
 Theres a little cup in the Cotswold hills
 Which a spring in a meadow bubbles and fills
 Spanned by a herons wingcrossed by a stride
 Calm and untroubled by dreams of pride
 Guiltless of Fame or ambitions aims
 That is the source of the lordly Thames
 Remark here again that custom contemns
 Both Tames and Thamesyou must SAY Tems
 But WHY no matterfrom them you can see
 Cirencesters tall spires loom up oer the lea

 A D Five Hundred and Fiftytwo
 The Saxon invadersa terrible crew
 Had forced the lines of the Britons through
 And Cirencester half mud and thatch
 Dry and crisp as a tinder match
 Was fiercely beleaguered by foes whod catch
 At any device that could harry and rout
 The folk that so boldly were holding out

 For the streets of the townas youll see today
 Were twisted and curved in a curious way
 That kept the invaders still at bay
 And the longest bolt that a Saxon drew
 Was stopped ere a dozen of yards it flew
 By a turn in the street and a law so true
 That even these robbersof all laws scorners
 Knew you couldnt shoot arrows AROUND street corners

 So they sat them down on a little knoll
 And each man scratched his Saxon poll
 And stared at the sky where clear and high
 The birds of that summer went singing by
 As if in his glee each motley jester
 Were mocking the foes of Cirencester
 Till the jeering crow and the saucy linnet
 Seemed all to be saying Ah youre not in it

 High oer their heads the mavis flew
 And the ouzelcock so black of hue
 And the throstle with his note so true
 You remember what Shakespeare saysHE knew
 And the soaring lark that kept dropping through
 Like a bucket spilling in wells of blue
 And the merlinseen on heraldic panes
 With legs as vague as the Queen of Spains

 And the dashing swift that would ricochet
 From the tufts of grasses before them yet
 Like bold Antaeuswould each time bring
 New life from the earth barely touched by his wing
 And the swallow and martlet that always knew
 The straightest way home Here a Saxon churl drew
 His breathtapped his foreheadan idea had got through

 So they brought them some nets which straightway they filled
 With the swallows and martletsthe sweet birds who build
 In the houses of manall that innocent guild
 Who sing at their labor on eaves and in thatch
 And they stuck on their feathers a rude lighted match
 Made of resin and tow Then they let them all go
 To be free As a childlike diversion Ah no
 To work Cirencesters red ruin and woe

 For straight to each nest they flew in wild quest
 Of their homes and their fledgelingsthat they loved the best
 And straighter than arrow of Saxon eer sped
 They shot oer the curving streets high overhead
 Bringing fire and terror to roof tree and bed
 Till the town broke in flame wherever they came
 To the Britons red ruinthe Saxons red shame

 Yet theyre all gone together Today youll dig up
 From mound or from barrow some arrow or cup
 Their fame is forgottentheir story is ended
 Neath the feet of the race they have mixed with and blended
 But the birds are unchangedthe ouzelcock sings
 Still gold on his crest and still black on his wings
 And the lark chants on high as he mounts to the sky
 Still brown in his coat and still dim in his eye
 While the swallow or martlet is still a free nester
 In the eaves and the roofs of thricebuilt Cirencester




LINES TO A PORTRAIT BY A SUPERIOR PERSON

 When I bought you for a song
 Years agoLord knows how long
 I was struckI may be wrong
 By your features
 Anda something in your air
 That I couldnt quite compare
 To my other plain or fair
 Fellow creatures

 In your simple oval frame
 You were not well known to fame
 But to metwas all the same
 Whoeer drew you
 For your face I cant forget
 Though I oftentimes regret
 That somehow I never yet
 Saw quite through you

 Yet each morning when I rise
 I go first to greet your eyes
 And in turn YOU scrutinize
 My presentment
 And when shades of evening fall
 As you hang upon my wall
 Youre the last thing I recall
 With contentment

 It is weakness yet I know
 That I never turned to go
 Anywhere for weal or woe
 But I lingered
 For one parting thrilling flash
 From your eyes to give that dash
 To the curl of my mustache
 That I fingered

 If to some you may seem plain
 And when people glance again
 Where you hang their lips refrain
 From confession
 Yet they turn in stealth aside
 And I note they try to hide
 How much they are satisfied
 In expression

 Other faces I have seen
 Other forms have come between
 Other things I have I ween
 Done and dared for
 But OUR ties they cannot sever
 And though I should say it never
 Youre the only one I ever
 Really cared for

 And youll still be hanging there
 When were both the worse for wear
 And the silvers on my hair
 And off your backing
 Yet my faith shall never pass
 In my dear old shavingglass
 Till my face and yours alas
 Both are lacking




HER LAST LETTER

 BEING A REPLY TO HIS ANSWER

 June 4th Do you know what that date means
 June 4th By this air and these pines
 Wellonly you know how I hate scenes
 These might be my very last lines
 For perhaps sir youll kindly remember
 If some OTHER things youve forgot
 That you last wrote the 4th of DECEMBER
 Just six months ago Ifrom this spot

 From this spot that you said was the fairest
 For once being held in my thought
 Now really I call that the barest
 Ofwell I wont say what I ought
 For here I am back from my riches
 My triumphs my tours and all that
 And YOURE not to be found in the ditches
 Or temples of Poverty Flat

 From Paris we went for the season
 To London when pa wired Stop
 Mama says his HEALTH was the reason
 Ive heard that some things took a drop
 But she said if my patience Id summon
 I could go back with him to the Flat
 Perhaps I was thinking of some one
 Who of mewellwas not thinking THAT

 Of course you will SAY that I never
 Replied to the letter you wrote
 That is just like a man But however
 I read itor how could I quote
 And as to the stories youve heard No
 Dont tell me you haventI know
 Youll not believe one blessed word Joe
 But just whence they came let them go

 And they came from Sade Lotski of Yolo
 Whose father sold clothes on the Bar
 You called him Joblotski you know Joe
 And the boys said HER value was par
 Well we met her in Parisjust flaring
 With diamonds and lost in a hat
 And she asked me how Joseph was faring
 In his lovesuit on Poverty Flat

 She thought it would shame me I met her
 With a look Joe that made her eyes drop
 And I said that your lovesuit fared better
 Than any suit out of THEIR shop
 And I didnt blush THENas Im doing
 To find myself here all alone
 And left Joe to do all the sueing
 To a lover thats certainly flown

 In this brandnew hotel called The Lily
 I wonder who gave it that name
 I really am feeling quite silly
 To think I was once called the same
 And I stare from its windows and fancy
 Im labeled to each passerby
 Ah gone is the old necromancy
 For nothing seems right to my eye

 On that hill there are stores that I knew not
 Theres a streetwhere I once lost my way
 And the copse where you once tied my shoeknot
 Is shamelessly open as day
 And that bank by the springI once drank there
 And you called the place Eden you know
 Now Im banished like Evethough the bank there
 Is belonging to Adams and Co

 Theres the rustle of silk on the sidewalk
 Just now there passed by a tall hat
 But theres gloom in this boom and this wild talk
 Of the future of Poverty Flat
 Theres a decorous chill in the air Joe
 Where once we were simple and free
 And I hear theyve been making a mayor Joe
 Of the man who shot Sandy McGee

 But theres still the lap lap of the river
 Theres the song of the pines deep and low
 How my longing for them made me quiver
 In the park that they call Fontainebleau
 Theres the snowpeak that looked on our dances
 And blushed when the morning said Go
 Theres a lot that remains which one fancies
 But somehow theres never a Joe

 Perhaps on the whole it is better
 For you might have been changed like the rest
 Though its strange that Im trusting this letter
 To papa just to have it addressed
 He thinks he may find you and really
 Seems kinder now Im all alone
 You might have been here Joe if merely
 To LOOK what Im willing to OWN

 Well well thats all past so goodnight Joe
 Goodnight to the river and Flat
 Goodnight to whats wrong and whats right Joe
 Goodnight to the past and all that
 To Harrisons barn and its dancers
 To the moon and the white peak of snow
 And goodnight to the canyon that answers
 My Joe with its echo of No

 P S

 Ive just got your note You deceiver
 How dared youhow COULD you Oh Joe
 To think Ive been kept a believer
 In things that were six months ago
 And its YOUVE built this house and the bank too
 And the mills and the stores and all that
 And for everything changed I must thank YOU
 Who have struck it on Poverty Flat

 How dared you get richyou great stupid
 Like papa and some men that I know
 Instead of just trusting to Cupid
 And to me for your money Ah Joe
 Just to think you sent never a word dear
 Till you wrote to papa for consent
 Now I know why they had me transferred here
 And the health of papawhat THAT meant

 Now I know why they call this The Lily
 Why the man who shot Sandy McGee
 You made mayor Twas becauseoh you silly
 He once went down the middle with me
 Ive been fooled to the top of my bent here
 So come and ask pardonyou know
 That youve still got to get MY consent dear
 And just think what that echo saidJoe





V PARODIES




BEFORE THE CURTAIN

 Behind the footlights hangs the rusty baize
 A trifle shabby in the upturned blaze
 Of flaring gas and curious eyes that gaze

 The stage methinks perhaps is none too wide
 And hardly fit for royal Richards stride
 Or Falstaffs bulk or Denmarks youthful pride

 Ah well no passion walks its humble boards
 Oer it no king nor valiant Hector lords
 The simplest skill is all its space affords

 The song and jest the dance and trifling play
 The local hit at follies of the day
 The trick to pass an idle hour away

 For these no trumpets that announce the Moor
 No blast that makes the heros welcome sure
 A single fiddle in the overture




TO THE PLIOCENE SKULL

 A GEOLOGICAL ADDRESS

 Speak O man less recent Fragmentary fossil
 Primal pioneer of pliocene formation
 Hid in lowest drifts below the earliest stratum
 Of volcanic tufa

 Older than the beasts the oldest Palaeotherium
 Older than the trees the oldest Cryptogami
 Older than the hills those infantile eruptions
 Of earths epidermis

 EoMioPliowhatsoeer the cene was
 That those vacant sockets filled with awe and wonder
 Whether shores Devonian or Silurian beaches
 Tell us thy strange story

 Or has the professor slightly antedated
 By some thousand years thy advent on this planet
 Giving thee an air thats somewhat better fitted
 For coldblooded creatures

 Wert thou true spectator of that mighty forest
 When above thy head the stately Sigillaria
 Reared its columned trunks in that remote and distant
 Carboniferous epoch

 Tell us of that scenethe dim and watery woodland
 Songless silent hushed with never bird or insect
 Veiled with spreading fronds and screened with tall club mosses
 Lycopodiacea

 When beside thee walked the solemn Plesiosaurus
 And around thee crept the festive Ichthyosaurus
 While from time to time above thee flew and circled
 Cheerful Pterodactyls

 Tell us of thy foodthose halfmarine refections
 Crinoids on the shell and Brachipods au naturel
 Cuttlefish to which the pieuvre of Victor Hugo
 Seems a periwinkle

 Speak thou awful vestige of the earths creation
 Solitary fragment of remains organic
 Tell the wondrous secret of thy past existence
 Speak thou oldest primate

 Even as I gazed a thrill of the maxilla
 And a lateral movement of the condyloid process
 With postpliocene sounds of healthy mastication
 Ground the teeth together

 And from that imperfect dental exhibition
 Stained with express juices of the weed nicotian
 Came these hollow accents blent with softer murmurs
 Of expectoration

 Which my name is Bowers and my crust was busted
 Falling down a shaft in Calaveras County
 But Id take it kindly if youd send the pieces
 Home to old Missouri

THE BALLAD OF MR COOKE

 LEGEND OF THE CLIFF HOUSE SAN FRANCISCO

 Where the sturdy ocean breeze
 Drives the spray of roaring seas
 That the Cliff House balconies
 Overlook
 There in spite of rain that balked
 With his sandals duly chalked
 Once upon a tightrope walked
 Mr Cooke

 But the jesters lightsome mien
 And his spangles and his sheen
 All had vanished when the scene
 He forsook
 Yet in some delusive hope
 In some vague desire to cope
 ONE still came to view the rope
 Walked by Cooke

 Amid Beautys bright array
 On that strange eventful day
 Partly hidden from the spray
 In a nook
 Stood Florinda Vere de Vere
 Who with winddisheveled hair
 And a rapt distracted air
 Gazed on Cooke

 Then she turned and quickly cried
 To her lover at her side
 While her form with love and pride
 Wildly shook
 Clifford Snook oh hear me now
 Here I break each plighted vow
 Theres but one to whom I bow
 And thats Cooke

 Haughtily that young man spoke
 I descend from noble folk
 Seven Oaks and then Sennoak
 Lastly Snook
 Is the way my name I trace
 Shall a youth of noble race
 In affairs of love give place
 To a Cooke

 Clifford Snook I know thy claim
 To that lineage and name
 And I think Ive read the same
 In Horne Tooke
 But I swear by all divine
 Never never to be thine
 Till thou canst upon yon line
 Walk like Cooke

 Though to that gymnastic feat
 He no closer might compete
 Than to strike a BALANCEsheet
 In a book
 Yet thenceforward from that day
 He his figure would display
 In some wild athletic way
 After Cooke

 On some household eminence
 On a clothesline or a fence
 Over ditches drains and thence
 Oer a brook
 He by high ambition led
 Ever walked and balanced
 Till the people wondering said
 How like Cooke

 Step by step did he proceed
 Nerved by valor not by greed
 And at last the crowning deed
 Undertook
 Misty was the midnight air
 And the cliff was bleak and bare
 When he came to do and dare
 Just like Cooke

 Through the darkness oer the flow
 Stretched the line where he should go
 Straight across as flies the crow
 Or the rook
 One wild glance around he cast
 Then he faced the ocean blast
 And he strode the cable last
 Touched by Cooke

 Vainly roared the angry seas
 Vainly blew the ocean breeze
 But alas the walkers knees
 Had a crook
 And before he reached the rock
 Did they both together knock
 And he stumbled with a shock
 Unlike Cooke

 Downward dropping in the dark
 Like an arrow to its mark
 Or a fishpole when a shark
 Bites the hook
 Dropped the pole he could not save
 Dropped the walker and the wave
 Swift engulfed the rival brave
 Of J Cooke

 Came a roar across the sea
 Of sealions in their glee
 In a tongue remarkably
 Like Chinook
 And the maddened seagull seemed
 Still to utter as he screamed
 Perish thus the wretch who deemed
 Himself Cooke

 But on misty moonlit nights
 Comes a skeleton in tights
 Walks once more the giddy heights
 He mistook
 And unseen to mortal eyes
 Purged of grosser earthly ties
 Now at last in spirit guise
 Outdoes Cooke

 Still the sturdy ocean breeze
 Sweeps the spray of roaring seas
 Where the Cliff House balconies
 Overlook
 And the maidens in their prime
 Reading of this mournful rhyme
 Weep where in the olden time
 Walked J Cooke




THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU

 Oh say have you seen at the Willows so green
 So charming and rurally true
 A singular bird with a manner absurd
 Which they call the Australian Emeu
 Have you
 Ever seen this Australian Emeu

 It trots all around with its head on the ground
 Or erects it quite out of your view
 And the ladies all cry when its figure they spy
 Oh what a sweet pretty Emeu
 Oh do
 Just look at that lovely Emeu

 One day to this spot when the weather was hot
 Came Matilda Hortense Fortescue
 And beside her there came a youth of high name
 Augustus Florell Montague
 The two
 Both loved that wild foreign Emeu

 With two loaves of bread then they fed it instead
 Of the flesh of the white Cockatoo
 Which once was its food in that wild neighborhood
 Where ranges the sweet Kangaroo
 That too
 Is game for the famous Emeu

 Old saws and gimlets but its appetite whets
 Like the worldfamous bark of Peru
 Theres nothing so hard that the bird will discard
 And nothing its taste will eschew
 That you
 Can give that longlegged Emeu

 The time slipped away in this innocent play
 When up jumped the bold Montague
 Wheres that specimen pin that I gayly did win
 In raffle and gave unto you
 Fortescue
 No word spoke the guilty Emeu

 Quick tell me his name whom thou gavest that same
 Ere these hands in thy blood I imbrue
 Nay dearest she cried as she clung to his side
 Im innocent as that Emeu
 Adieu
 He replied Miss M H Fortescue

 Down she dropped at his feet all as white as a sheet
 As wildly he fled from her view
 He thought twas her sinfor he knew not the pin
 Had been gobbled up by the Emeu
 All through
 The voracity of that Emeu




MRS JUDGE JENKINS

 BEING THE ONLY GENUINE SEQUEL TO MAUD MULLER

 Maud Muller all that summer day
 Raked the meadow sweet with hay

 Yet looking down the distant lane
 She hoped the Judge would come again

 But when he came with smile and bow
 Maud only blushed and stammered Haow

 And spoke of her pa and wondered whether
 Hed give consent they should wed together

 Old Muller burst in tears and then
 Begged that the Judge would lend him ten

 For trade was dull and wages low
 And the craps this year were somewhat slow

 And ere the languid summer died
 Sweet Maud became the Judges bride

 But on the day that they were mated
 Mauds brother Bob was intoxicated

 And Mauds relations twelve in all
 Were very drunk at the Judges hall

 And when the summer came again
 The young bride bore him babies twain

 And the Judge was blest but thought it strange
 That bearing children made such a change

 For Maud grew broad and red and stout
 And the waist that his arm once clasped about

 Was more than he now could span and he
 Sighed as he pondered ruefully

 How that which in Maud was native grace
 In Mrs Jenkins was out of place

 And thought of the twins and wished that they
 Looked less like the men who raked the hay

 On Mullers farm and dreamed with pain
 Of the day he wandered down the lane

 And looking down that dreary track
 He half regretted that he came back

 For had he waited he might have wed
 Some maiden fair and thoroughbred

 For there be women fair as she
 Whose verbs and nouns do more agree

 Alas for maiden alas for judge
 And the sentimentalthats onehalf fudge

 For Maud soon thought the Judge a bore
 With all his learning and all his lore

 And the Judge would have bartered Mauds fair face
 For more refinement and social grace

 If of all words of tongue and pen
 The saddest are It might have been

 More sad are these we daily see
 It is but hadnt ought to be




A GEOLOGICAL MADRIGAL

 I have found out a gift for my fair
 I know where the fossils abound
 Where the footprints of Aves declare
 The birds that once walked on the ground
 Oh come andin technical speech
 Well walk this Devonian shore
 Or on some Silurian beach
 Well wander my love evermore

 I will show thee the sinuous track
 By the slowmoving Annelid made
 Or the Trilobite that farther back
 In the old Potsdam sandstone was laid
 Thou shalt see in his Jurassic tomb
 The Plesiosaurus embalmed
 In his Oolitic prime and his bloom
 Iguanodon safe and unharmed

 You wishedI remember it well
 And I loved you the more for that wish
 For a perfect cystedian shell
 And a WHOLE holocephalic fish
 And oh if Earths strata contains
 In its lowest Silurian drift
 Or palaeozoic remains
 The same tis your lovers free gift

 Then come love and never say nay
 But calm all your maidenly fears
 Well note love in one summers day
 The record of millions of years
 And though the Darwinian plan
 Your sensitive feelings may shock
 Well find the beginning of man
 Our fossil ancestors in rock




AVITOR

 AN AERIAL RETROSPECT

 What was it filled my youthful dreams
 In place of Greek or Latin themes
 Or beautys wild bewildering beams
 Avitor

 What visions and celestial scenes
 I filled with aerial machines
 Montgolfiers and Mr Greens
 Avitor

 What fairy tales seemed things of course
 The roc that brought Sindbad across
 The Calendars own winged horse
 Avitor

 How many things I took for facts
 Icarus and his conduct lax
 And how he sealed his fate with wax
 Avitor

 The first balloons I sought to sail
 Soapbubbles fair but all too frail
 Or kitesbut thereby hangs a tail
 Avitor

 What made me launch from attic tall
 A kitten and a parasol
 And watch their bitter frightful fall
 Avitor

 What youthful dreams of high renown
 Bade me inflate the parsons gown
 That went not up nor yet came down
 Avitor

 My first ascent I may not tell
 Enough to know that in that well
 My first high aspirations fell
 Avitor

 My other failures let me pass
 The dire explosions and alas
 The friends I choked with noxious gas
 Avitor

 For lo I see perfected rise
 The vision of my boyish eyes
 The messenger of upper skies
 Avitor




THE WILLOWS

 AFTER EDGAR ALLAN POE

 The skies they were ashen and sober
 The streets they were dirty and drear
 It was night in the month of October
 Of my most immemorial year
 Like the skies I was perfectly sober
 As I stopped at the mansion of Shear
 At the Nightingaleperfectly sober
 And the willowy woodland down here

 Here once in an alley Titanic
 Of Tenpins I roamed with my soul
 Of Tenpins with Mary my soul
 They were days when my heart was volcanic
 And impelled me to frequently roll
 And made me resistlessly roll
 Till my tenstrikes created a panic
 In the realms of the Boreal pole
 Till my tenstrikes created a panic
 With the monkey atop of his pole

 I repeat I was perfectly sober
 But my thoughts they were palsied and sear
 My thoughts were decidedly queer
 For I knew not the month was October
 And I marked not the night of the year
 I forgot that sweet morceau of Auber
 That the band oft performed down here
 And I mixed the sweet music of Auber
 With the Nightingales music by Shear

 And now as the night was senescent
 And stardials pointed to morn
 And cardrivers hinted of morn
 At the end of the path a liquescent
 And bibulous lustre was born
 Twas made by the barkeeper present
 Who mixed a duplicate horn
 His two hands describing a crescent
 Distinct with a duplicate horn

 And I said This looks perfectly regal
 For its warm and I know I feel dry
 I am confident that I feel dry
 We have come past the emeu and eagle
 And watched the gay monkey on high
 Let us drink to the emeu and eagle
 To the swan and the monkey on high
 To the eagle and monkey on high
 For this barkeeper will not inveigle
 Bully boy with the vitreous eye
 He surely would never inveigle
 Sweet youth with the crystalline eye

 But Mary uplifting her finger
 Said Sadly this bar I mistrust
 I fear that this bar does not trust
 Oh hasten oh let us not linger
 Oh flylet us flyare we must
 In terror she cried letting sink her
 Parasol till it trailed in the dust
 In agony sobbed letting sink her
 Parasol till it trailed in the dust
 Till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust

 Then I pacified Mary and kissed her
 And tempted her into the room
 And conquered her scruples and gloom
 And we passed to the end of the vista
 But were stopped by the warning of doom
 By some words that were warning of doom
 And I said What is written sweet sister
 At the opposite end of the room
 She sobbed as she answered All liquors
 Must be paid for ere leaving the room

 Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
 As the streets were deserted and drear
 For my pockets were empty and drear
 And I cried It was surely October
 On this very night of last year
 That I journeyed I journeyed down here
 That I brought a fair maiden down here
 On this night of all nights in the year
 Ah to me that inscription is clear
 Well I know now Im perfectly sober
 Why no longer they credit me here
 Well I know now that music of Auber
 And this Nightingale kept by one Shear




NORTH BEACH

 AFTER SPENSER

 Lo where the castle of bold Pfeiffer throws
 Its sullen shadow on the rolling tide
 No more the home where joy and wealth repose
 But now where wassailers in cells abide
 See yon long quay that stretches far and wide
 Well known to citizens as wharf of Meiggs
 There each sweet Sabbath walks in maiden pride
 The pensive Margaret and brave Pat whose legs
 Encased in broadcloth oft keep time with Pegs

 Here cometh oft the tender nurserymaid
 While in her ear her love his tale doth pour
 Meantime her infant doth her charge evade
 And rambleth sagely on the sandy shore
 Till the sly seacrab low in ambush laid
 Seizeth his leg and biteth him full sore
 Ah me what sounds the shuddering echoes bore
 When his small treble mixed with Oceans roar

 Hard by there stands an ancient hostelrie
 And at its side a garden where the bear
 The stealthy catamount and coon agree
 To work deceit on all who gather there
 And when Augustathat unconscious fair
 With nuts and apples plieth Bruin free
 Lo the green parrot claweth her back hair
 And the gray monkey grabbeth fruits that she
 On her gay bonnet wears and laugheth loud in glee




THE LOST TAILS OF MILETUS

 High on the Thracian hills half hid in the billows of clover
 Thyme and the asphodel blooms and lulled by Pactolian streamlet
 She of Miletus lay and beside her an aged satyr
 Scratched his ear with his hoof and playfully mumbled his chestnuts

 Vainly the Maenid and the Bassarid gamboled about her
 The freeeyed Bacchante sang and Panthe renowned the
 accomplishedExecuted his difficult solo In vain were their
 gambols and dances
 High oer the Thracian hills rose the voice of the shepherdess
 wailing

 Ai for the fleecy flocks the meeknosed the passionless faces
 Ai for the tallowscented the straighttailed the highstepping
 Ai for the timid glance which is that which the rustic sagacious
 Applies to him who loves but may not declare his passion

 Her then Zeus answered slow O daughter of song and sorrow
 Hapless tender of sheep arise from thy long lamentation
 Since thou canst not trust fate nor behave as becomes a Greek maiden
 Look and behold thy sheep And lo they returned to her tailless




THE RITUALIST

 BY A COMMUNICANT OF ST JAMESS

 He wore I think a chasuble the day when first we met
 A stole and snowy alb likewiseI recollect it yet
 He called me daughter as he raised his jeweled hand to bless
 And then in thrilling undertones he asked Would I confess

 O mother dear blame not your child if then on bended knees
 I dropped and thought of Abelard and also Eloise
 Or when beside the altar high he bowed before the pyx
 I envied that seraphic kiss he gave the crucifix

 The cruel world may think it wrong perhaps may deem me weak
 And speaking of that sainted man may call his conduct cheek
 And like that wicked barrister whom Cousin Harry quotes
 May term his mixed chalice grog his vestments petticoats

 But whatsoeer they do or say Ill build a Christians hope
 On incense and on altarlights on chasuble and cope
 Let others prove by precedent the faith that they profess
 His cant be wrong thats symbolized by such becoming dress




A MORAL VINDICATOR

 If Mr Jones Lycurgus B
 Had one peculiar quality
 Twas his severe advocacy
 Of conjugal fidelity

 His views of heaven were very free
 His views of life were painfully
 Ridiculous but fervently
 He dwelt on marriage sanctity

 He frequently went on a spree
 But in his wildest revelry
 On this especial subject he
 Betrayed no ambiguity

 And though at times Lycurgus B
 Did lay his hands not lovingly
 Upon his wife the sanctity
 Of wedlock was his guaranty

 But Mrs Jones declined to see
 Affairs in the same light as he
 And quietly got a decree
 Divorcing her from that L B

 And what did Jones Lycurgus B
 With his known idiosyncrasy
 He smileda bitter smile to see
 And drew the weapon of Bowie

 He did what Sickles did to Key
 What Cole on Hiscock wrought did he
 In fact on persons twentythree
 He proved the marriage sanctity

 The counselor who took the fee
 The witnesses and referee
 The judge who granted the decree
 Died in that wholesale butchery

 And then when Jones Lycurgus B
 Had wiped the weapon of Bowie
 Twelve jurymen did instantly
 Acquit and set Lycurgus free




CALIFORNIA MADRIGAL

 ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING

 Oh come my beloved from thy winter abode
 From thy home on the Yuba thy ranch overflowed
 For the waters have fallen the winter has fled
 And the river once more has returned to its bed

 Oh mark how the spring in its beauty is near
 How the fences and tules once more reappear
 How soft lies the mud on the banks of yon slough
 By the hole in the levee the waters broke through

 All nature dear Chloris is blooming to greet
 The glance of your eye and the tread of your feet
 For the trails are all open the roads are all free
 And the highwaymans whistle is heard on the lea

 Again swings the lash on the high mountain trail
 And the pipe of the packer is scenting the gale
 The oath and the jest ringing high oer the plain
 Where the smut is not always confined to the grain

 Once more glares the sunlight on awning and roof
 Once more the red clays pulverized by the hoof
 Once more the dust powders the outsides with red
 Once more at the station the whiskey is spread

 Then fly with me love ere the summers begun
 And the mercury mounts to one hundred and one
 Ere the grass now so green shall be withered and sear
 In the spring that obtains but one month in the year




WHAT THE ENGINES SAID

 OPENING OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD

 What was it the Engines said
 Pilots touchinghead to head
 Facing on the single track
 Half a world behind each back
 This is what the Engines said
 Unreported and unread

 With a prefatory screech
 In a florid Western speech
 Said the Engine from the WEST
 I am from Sierras crest
 And if altitudes a test
 Why I reckon its confessed
 That Ive done my level best

 Said the Engine from the EAST
 They who work best talk the least
 Spose you whistle down your brakes
 What youve done is no great shakes
 Pretty fairbut let our meeting
 Be a different kind of greeting
 Let these folks with champagne stuffing
 Not their Engines do the PUFFING

 Listen Where Atlantic beats
 Shores of snow and summer heats
 Where the Indian autumn skies
 Paint the woods with wampum dyes
 I have chased the flying sun
 Seeing all he looked upon
 Blessing all that he has blessed
 Nursing in my iron breast
 All his vivifying heat
 All his clouds about my crest
 And before my flying feet
 Every shadow must retreat

 Said the Western Engine Phew
 And a long low whistle blew
 Come now really thats the oddest
 Talk for one so very modest
 You brag of your East YOU do
 Why I bring the East to YOU
 All the Orient all Cathay
 Find through me the shortest way
 And the sun you follow here
 Rises in my hemisphere
 Reallyif one must be rude
 Length my friend aint longitude

 Said the Union Dont reflect or
 Ill run over some Director
 Said the Central Im Pacific
 But when riled Im quite terrific
 Yet today we shall not quarrel
 Just to show these folks this moral
 How two Enginesin their vision
 Once have met without collision

 That is what the Engines said
 Unreported and unread
 Spoken slightly through the nose
 With a whistle at the close




THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE

 Beetling walls with ivy grown
 Frowning heights of mossy stone
 Turret with its flaunting flag
 Flung from battlemented crag
 Dungeonkeep and fortalice
 Looking down a precipice
 Oer the darkly glancing wave
 By the Lurlinehaunted cave
 Robber haunt and maiden bower
 Home of Love and Crime and Power
 Thats the scenery in fine
 Of the Legends of the Rhine

 One bold baron doubledyed
 Bigamist and parricide
 And as most the stories run
 Partner of the Evil One
 Injured innocence in white
 Fair but idiotic quite
 Wringing of her lily hands
 Valor fresh from Paynim lands
 Abbot ruddy hermit pale
 Minstrel fraught with many a tale
 Are the actors that combine
 In the Legends of the Rhine

 Bellmouthed flagons round a board
 Suits of armor shield and sword
 Kerchief with its bloody stain
 Ghosts of the untimely slain
 Thunderclap and clanking chain
 Headsmans block and shining axe
 Thumbscrew crucifixes racks
 Midnighttolling chapel bell
 Heard across the gloomy fell
 These and other pleasant facts
 Are the properties that shine
 In the Legends of the Rhine

 Maledictions whispered vows
 Underneath the linden boughs
 Murder bigamy and theft
 Travelers of goods bereft
 Rapine pillage arson spoil
 Everything but honest toil
 Are the deeds that best define
 Every Legend of the Rhine

 That Virtue always meets reward
 But quicker when it wears a sword
 That Providence has special care
 Of gallant knight and lady fair
 That villains as a thing of course
 Are always haunted by remorse
 Is the moral I opine
 Of the Legends of the Rhine




SONGS WITHOUT SENSE

FOR THE PARLOR AND PIANO


 I THE PERSONIFIED SENTIMENTAL

 Affections charm no longer gilds
 The idol of the shrine
 But cold Oblivion seeks to fill
 Regrets ambrosial wine
 Though Friendships offering buried lies
 Neath cold Aversions snow
 Regard and Faith will ever bloom
 Perpetually below

 I see thee whirl in marble halls
 In Pleasures giddy train
 Remorse is never on that brow
 Nor Sorrows mark of pain
 Deceit has marked thee for her own
 Inconstancy the same
 And Ruin wildly sheds its gleam
 Athwart thy path of shame

 II THE HOMELY PATHETIC

 The dews are heavy on my brow
 My breath comes hard and low
 Yet mother dear grant one request
 Before your boy must go
 Oh lift me ere my spirit sinks
 And ere my senses fail
 Place me once more O mother dear
 Astride the old fencerail

 The old fencerail the old fencerail
 How oft these youthful legs
 With Alice and Ben Bolts were hung
 Across those wooden pegs
 Twas there the nauseating smoke
 Of my first pipe arose
 O mother dear these agonies
 Are far less keen than those

 I know where lies the hazel dell
 Where simple Nellie sleeps
 I know the cot of Nettie Moore
 And where the willow weeps
 I know the brookside and the mill
 But all their pathos fails
 Beside the days when once I sat
 Astride the old fencerails

 III SWISS AIR

 Im a gay tra la la
 With my fal lal la la
 And my bright
 And my light
 Tra la le Repeat

 Then laugh ha ha ha
 And ring ting ling ling
 And sing fal la la
 La la le Repeat



 VI LITTLE POSTERITY




MASTER JOHNNYS NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOR

 It was spring the first time that I saw her for her papa and mamma
 moved in
 Next door just as skating was over and marbles about to begin
 For the fence in our back yard was broken and I saw as I peeped
 through the slat
 There were Johnnyjumpups all around her and I knew it was
 spring just by that

 I never knew whether she saw me for she didnt say nothing to me
 But Ma heres a slat in the fence broke and the boy that is next
 door can see
 But the next day I climbed on our woodshed as you know Mamma says
 Ive a right
 And she calls out Well peekin is manners and I answered her
 Sass is perlite

 But I wasnt a bit mad no Papa and to prove it the very next day
 When she ran past our fence in the morning I happened to get in her
 way
 For you know I am chunked and clumsy as she says are all boys of
 my size
 And she nearly upset me she did Pa and laughed till tears came in
 her eyes

 And then we were friends from that moment for I knew that she told
 Kitty Sage
 And she wasnt a girl that would flatterthat she thought I was
 tall for my age
 And I gave her four apples that evening and took her to ride on my
 sled
 And What am I telling you this for Why Papa my neighbor is
 DEAD

 You dont hear one half I am sayingI really do think its too bad
 Why you might have seen crape on her doorknob and noticed today
 Ive been sad
 And theyve got her a coffin of rosewood and they say they have
 dressed her in white
 And Ive never once looked through the fence Pa since she diedat
 eleven last night

 And Ma says its decent and proper as I was her neighbor and friend
 That I should go there to the funeral and she thinks that YOU ought
 to attend
 But I am so clumsy and awkward I know I shall be in the way
 And suppose they should speak to me Papa I wouldnt know just what
 to say

 So I think I will get up quite earlyI know I sleep late but I know
 Ill be sure to wake up if our Bridget pulls the string that Ill tie
 to my toe
 And Ill crawl through the fence and Ill gather the Johnnyjumpups
 as they grew
 Round her feet the first day that I saw her and Papa Ill give
 them to you

 For youre a big man and you know Pa can come and go just where
 you choose
 And youll take the flowers in to her and surely theyll never
 refuse
 But Papa dont SAY theyre from Johnny THEY wont understand
 dont you see
 But just lay them down on her bosom and Papa SHELL know theyre
 from Me




MISS EDITHS MODEST REQUEST

 My Papa knows you and he says youre a man who makes reading for
 books
 But I never read nothing you wrote nor did PapaI know by his
 looks
 So I guess youre like me when I talk and I talk and I talk all
 the day
 And they only say Do stop that child or Nurse take Miss Edith
 away

 But Papa said if I was good I could ask youalone by myself
 If you wouldnt write me a book like that little one up on the shelf
 I dont mean the pictures of course for to make THEM youve got to
 be smart
 But the reading that runs all around them you knowjust the
 easiest part

 You neednt mind what its about for no one will see it but me
 And Janethats my nurseand Johnhes the coachmanjust
 only us three
 Youre to write of a bad little girl that was wicked and bold and
 all that
 And then youre to write if you please something goodvery good
 of a cat

 This cat she was virtuous and meek and kind to her parents and
 mild
 And careful and neat in her ways though her mistress was such a bad
 child
 And hours she would sit and would gaze when her mistressthats me
 was so bad
 And blink just as if she would say Oh Edith you make my heart
 sad

 And yet you would scarcely believe it that beautiful angelic cat
 Was blamed by the servants for stealing whatever they said shed
 get at
 And when John drank my milkdont you tell me I know just the
 way it was done
 They said twas the catand she sitting and washing her face in
 the sun

 And then there was Dick my canary When I left its cage open one
 day
 They all made believe that she ate it though I know that the bird
 flew away
 And why Just because she was playing with a feather she found on
 the floor
 As if cats couldnt play with a feather without people thinking
 twas more

 Why once we were romping together when I knocked down a vase from
 the shelf
 That cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself
 And she walked away sadly and hid herself and never came out until
 tea
 So they say for they sent ME to bed and she never came even to me

 No matter whatever happened it was laid at the door of that cat
 Why once when I tore my apronshe was wrapped in it and I called
 Rat
 Why they blamed that on HER I shall neverno not to my dying
 day
 Forget the pained look that she gave me when they slapped ME and
 took me away

 Of course you know just what comes next when a child is as lovely
 as that
 She wasted quite slowly away it was goodness was killing that cat
 I know it was nothing she ate for her taste was exceedingly nice
 But they said she stole Bobbys ice cream and caught a bad cold
 from the ice

 And youll promise to make me a book like that little one up on the
 shelf
 And youll call her Naomi because its a name that she just gave
 herself
 For shed scratch at my door in the morning and whenever Id call
 out Whos there
 She would answer Naomi Naomi like a Christian I vow and declare

 And youll put me and her in a book And mind youre to say I was
 bad
 And I might have been badder than that but for the example I had
 And youll say that she was a Maltese andwhats that you asked
 Is she dead
 Why please sir THERE AINT ANY CAT Youre to make one up out of
 your head




MISS EDITH MAKES IT PLEASANT FOR BROTHER JACK

 Crying Of course I am crying and I guess you would be crying
 too
 If people were telling such stories as they tell about me about YOU
 Oh yes you can laugh if you want to and smoke as you didnt care
 how
 And get your brains softened like uncles Dr Jones says youre
 gettin it now

 Why dont you say Stop to Miss Ilsey She cries twice as much as
 I do
 And shes older and cries just from meannessfor a ribbon or
 anything new
 Ma says its her sensitive nature Oh my No I shant stop my
 talk
 And I dont want no apples nor candy and I dont want to go take a
 walk

 I know why youre mad Yes I do now You think that Miss Ilsey
 likes YOU
 And Ive heard her REPEATEDLY call you the boldfacest boy that she
 knew
 And shed like to know where you learnt manners Oh yes Kick
 the tablethats right
 Spill the ink on my dress and go then round telling Ma that I look
 like a fright

 What stories Pretend you dont know that theyre saying I broke
 off the match
 Twixt old Moneygrubber and Mary by saying she called him
 Crosspatch
 When the only allusion I made him about sister Mary was she
 Cared more for his cash than his temper and you know Jack you
 said that to me

 And its true But its ME and Im scolded and Pa says if I keep
 on I might
 By and by get my name in the papers Who cares Why twas only
 last night
 I was reading how Pa and the sheriff were selling some lots and
 its plain
 If its awful to be in the papers why Papa would go and complain

 You think it aint true about Ilsey Well I guess I know girls
 and I say
 Theres nothing I see about Ilsey to show she likes you anyway
 I know what it means when a girl who has called her cat after one
 boy
 Goes and changes its name to anothers And shes done itand I
 wish you joy




MISS EDITH MAKES ANOTHER FRIEND

 Oh youre the girl lives on the corner Come inif you want to
 come quick
 Theres no one but me in the house and the cookbut shes only a
 stick
 Dont try the front way but come over the fencethrough the
 windowthats how
 Dont mind the big doghe wont bite youjust see him obey me
 there now

 Whats your name Mary Ellen How funny Mines Edithits
 nicer you see
 But yours does for you for youre plainer though maybe youre
 gooder than me
 For Jack says Im sometimes a devil but Jack of all folks neednt
 talk
 For I dont call the seamstress an angel till Ma says the poor thing
 must walk

 Come in Its quite dark in the parlor for sister will keep the
 blinds down
 For you know her complexion is sallow like yours but she isnt as
 brown
 Though Jack says that isnt the reason she likes to sit here with
 Jim Moore
 Do you think that he meant that she kissed him Would youif your
 lips wasnt sore

 If you like you can try our piano Taint ours A man left it
 here
 To rent by the month although Ma says he hasnt been paid for a
 year
 Sister playsoh such fine variationswhy I once heard a
 gentleman say
 That she didnt mind THAT for the musicin fact it was just in her
 way

 Aint I funny And yet its the queerest of all that whatever I
 say
 One half of the folks die alaughing and the rest they all look
 tother way
 And some say That child Do they ever say that to such people as
 you
 Though maybe youre naturally silly and that makes your eyes so
 askew

 Now stopdont you dare to be crying Just as sure as you live if
 you do
 Ill call in my big dog to bite you and Ill make my Papa kill you
 too
 And then wherell you be So play pretty Theres my doll and a
 nice piece of cake
 You dont want ityou think it is poison Then ILL eat it dear
 just for your sake




WHAT MISS EDITH SAW FROM HER WINDOW

 Our windows not much though it fronts on the street
 Theres a fly in the pane that gets nothin to eat
 But its curious how people think its a treat
 For ME to look out of the window

 Why when company comes and theyre all speaking low
 With their chairs drawn together then some one says Oh
 Edith dearthats a good childnow run love and go
 And amuse yourself there at the window

 Or Bobthats my brothercomes in with his chum
 And they whisper and chuckle the same words will come
 And its Edith look here Oh I say what a rum
 Lot of things you can see from that window

 And yet as I told you theres only that fly
 Buzzing round in the pane and a bit of blue sky
 And the girl in the opposite window that I
 Look at when SHE looks from HER window

 And yet Ive been thinking Id so like to see
 If what goes on behind HER goes on behind ME
 And then goodness gracious what fun it would be
 For us BOTH as we sit by our window

 How wed know when the parcels were hid in a drawer
 Or things taken out that one never sees more
 What people come in and go out of the door
 That we never see from the window

 And that night when the stranger came home with our Jane
 I might SEE what I HEARD then that sounded so plain
 Like when my wet fingers I rub on the pane
 Which they wont let ME do on my window

 And Id know why papa shut the door with a slam
 And said something funny that sounded like jam
 And then Edithwhere are you I said Here I am
 Ah thats right dear look out of the window

 They say when Im grown up these things will appear
 More plain than they do when I look at them here
 But I think I see some things uncommonly clear
 As I sit and look down from the window

 What things Oh the things that I make up you know
 Out of stories Ive readand they all pass below
 Ali Baba the Forty Thieves all in a row
 Go by as I look from my window

 Thats only at church time other days theres no crowd
 Dont laugh See that big man who looked up and bowed
 Thats our butcherI call him the Sultan Mahoud
 When he nods to me here at the window

 And THAT manhes our neighborjust gone for a ride
 Has three wives in the churchyard that lie side by side
 So I call him Bluebeard in search of his bride
 While Im Sister Anne at the window

 And what do I call you Well heres what I DO
 When my sister expects you she puts me here too
 But I wait till you enter to see if its you
 And thenI just OPEN the window

 Dear child Yes thats me Oh you ask what thats for
 Well Papa says youre Povertys self and whats more
 I open the window when YOURE at the door
 To see Love fly out of the window




ON THE LANDING

 AN IDYL OF THE BALUSTERS


 BOBBY aetat 3 12 JOHNNY aetat 4 12


 BOBBY

 Do you know why theyve put us in that back room
 Up in the attic close against the sky
 And made believe our nurserys a cloakroom
 Do you know why

 JOHNNY

 No more I dont nor why that Sammys mother
 What Ma thinks horrid cause he bunged my eye
 Eats an ice cream down there like any other
 No more dont I

 BOBBY

 Do you know why Nurse says it isnt manners
 For you and me to ask folks twice for pie
 And no one hits that man with two bananas
 Do you know why

 JOHNNY

 No more I dont nor why that girl whose dress is
 Off of her shoulders dont catch cold and die
 When you and me gets croup when WE undresses
 No more dont I

 BOBBY

 Perhaps she aint as good as you and I is
 And God dont want her up there in the sky
 And lets her liveto come in just when pie is
 Perhaps thats why

 JOHNNY

 Do you know why that man thats got a cropped head
 Rubbed it just now as if he felt a fly
 Could it be Bobby something that I dropped
 And is that why

 BOBBY

 Good boys behaves and so they dont get scolded
 Nor drop hot milk on folks as they pass by

 JOHNNY piously

 Marbles would bounce on Mr Jones bald head
 But I shant try

 BOBBY

 Do you know why Aunt Jane is always snarling
 At you and me because we tells a lie
 And she dont slap that man that called her darling
 Do you know why

 JOHNNY

 No more I dont nor why that man with Mamma
 Just kissed her hand

 BOBBY

 She hurt itand thats why
 He made it well the very way that Mamma
 Does do to I

 JOHNNY

 I feel so sleepy Was that Papa kissed us
 What made him sigh and look up to the sky

 BOBBY

 We werent downstairs and he and God had missed us
 And that was why





NOTES

THE LOST GALLEON As the custom on which the central incident of
this legend is based may not be familiar to all readers I will
repeat here that it is the habit of navigators to drop a day from
their calendar in crossing westerly the 180th degree of longitude of
Greenwich adding a day in coming east and that the idea of the
lost galleon had an origin as prosaic as the log of the first China
Mail Steamer from San Francisco The explanation of the custom and
its astronomical relations belongs rather to the usual textbooks
than to poetical narration If any reader thinks I have overdrawn
the credulous superstitions of the ancient navigators I refer him
to the veracious statements of Maldonado De Fonte the later
voyages of La Perouse and Anson and the charts of 1640 In the
charts of that day Spanish navigators reckoned longitude E 360
degrees from the meridian of the Isle of Ferro For the sake of
perspicuity before a modern audience the more recent meridian of
Madrid was substituted The custom of dropping a day at some
arbitrary point in crossing the Pacific westerly I need not say
remains unaffected by any change of meridian I know not if any
galleon was ever really missing For two hundred and fifty years an
annual trip was made between Acapulco and Manila It may be some
satisfaction to the more severely practical of my readers to know
that according to the best statistics of insurance the loss during
that period would be exactly three vessels and six hundredths of a
vessel which would certainly justify me in this summary disposition
of ONE

THE PLIOCENE SKULL This extraordinary fossil is in the possession
of Prof Josiah D Whitney of the State Geological Survey of
California The poem was based on the following paragraph from the
daily press of 1868 A human skull has been found in California in
the pliocene formation This skull is the remnant not only of the
earliest pioneer of this State but the oldest known human being
The skull was found in a shaft 150 feet deep two miles from Angels
in Calaveras County by a miner named James Watson who gave it to
Mr Scribner a merchant who gave it to Dr Jones who sent it to
the State Geological Survey The published volume of the
State Survey of the Geology of California states that man existed
here contemporaneously with the mastodon but this fossil proves
that he was here before the mastodon was known to exist
