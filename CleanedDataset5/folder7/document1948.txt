THE STORY OF A BAD BOY


by Thomas Bailey Aldrich




Chapter OneIn Which I Introduce Myself


This is the story of a bad boy Well not such a very bad but a pretty
bad boy and I ought to know for I am or rather I was that boy
myself

Lest the title should mislead the reader I hasten to assure him here
that I have no dark confessions to make I call my story the story of
a bad boy partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young
gentlemen who generally figure in narratives of this kind and partly
because I really was not a cherub I may truthfully say I was an
amiable impulsive lad blessed with fine digestive powers and no
hypocrite I didnt want to be an angel and with the angels stand I
didnt think the missionary tracts presented to me by the Rev Wibird
Hawkins were half so nice as Robinson Crusoe and I didnt send my
little pocketmoney to the natives of the Feejee Islands but spent
it royally in peppermintdrops and taffy candy In short I was a real
human boy such as you may meet anywhere in New England and no more
like the impossible boy in a storybook than a sound orange is like one
that has been sucked dry But let us begin at the beginning

Whenever a new scholar came to our school I used to confront him at
recess with the following words My names Tom Bailey whats your
name If the name struck me favorably I shook hands with the new
pupil cordially but if it didnt I would turn on my heel for I was
particular on this point Such names as Higgins Wiggins and Spriggins
were deadly affronts to my ear while Langdon Wallace Blake and the
like were passwords to my confidence and esteem

Ah me some of those dear fellows are rather elderly boys by this
timelawyers merchants seacaptains soldiers authors what not Phil
Adams a special good name that Adams is consul at Shanghai where I
picture him to myself with his head closely shavedhe never had too much
hairand a long pigtail banging down behind He is married I hear
and I hope he and she that was Miss Wang Wang are very happy together
sitting crosslegged over their diminutive cups of tea in a skyblue
tower hung with bells It is so I think of him to me he is henceforth
a jewelled mandarin talking nothing but broken China Whitcomb is a
judge sedate and wise with spectacles balanced on the bridge of that
remarkable nose which in former days was so plentifully sprinkled with
freckles that the boys christened him Pepper Whitcomb Just to think
of little Pepper Whitcomb being a judge What would he do to me now I
wonder if I were to sing out Pepper some day in court Fred Langdon
is in California in the nativewine businesshe used to make the best
licoricewater I ever tasted Binny Wallace sleeps in the Old South
BuryingGround and Jack Harris too is deadHarris who commanded us
boys of old in the famous snowball battles of Slatters Hill Was it
yesterday I saw him at the head of his regiment on its way to join the
shattered Army of the Potomac Not yesterday but six years ago It was
at the battle of the Seven Pines Gallant Jack Harris that never drew
rein until he had dashed into the Rebel battery So they found himlying
across the enemys guns

How we have parted and wandered and married and died I wonder what
has become of all the boys who went to the Temple Grammar School at
Rivermouth when I was a youngster All all are gone the old familiar
faces

It is with no ungentle hand I summon them back for a moment from that
Past which has closed upon them and upon me How pleasantly they live
again in my memory Happy magical Past in whose fairy atmosphere even
Conway mine ancient foe stands forth transfigured with a sort of
dreamy glory encircling his bright red hair

With the old school formula I commence these sketches of my boyhood My
name is Tom Bailey what is yours gentle reader I take for granted
it is neither Wiggins nor Spriggins and that we shall get on famously
together and be capital friends forever




Chapter TwoIn Which I Entertain Peculiar Views


I was born at Rivermouth but before I had a chance to become very well
acquainted with that pretty New England town my parents removed to New
Orleans where my father invested his money so securely in the banking
business that he was never able to get any of it out again But of this
hereafter

I was only eighteen months old at the time of the removal and it didnt
make much difference to me where I was because I was so small but
several years later when my father proposed to take me North to be
educated I had my own peculiar views on the subject I instantly kicked
over the little Negro boy who happened to be standing by me at the
moment and stamping my foot violently on the floor of the piazza
declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees

You see I was what is called a Northern man with Southern principles
I had no recollection of New England my earliest memories were
connected with the South with Aunt Chloe my old Negro nurse and
with the great illkept garden in the centre of which stood our housea
whitewashed stone house it was with wide verandasshut out from the
street by lines of orange fig and magnolia trees I knew I was born
at the North but hoped nobody would find it out I looked upon the
misfortune as something so shrouded by time and distance that maybe
nobody remembered it I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee
because they talked about the Yankees in such a scornful way it made
me feel that it was quite a disgrace not to be born in Louisiana or at
least in one of the Border States And this impression was strengthened
by Aunt Chloe who said dar wasnt no gentlmen in the Norf no way
and on one occasion terrified me beyond measure by declaring that
if any of dem mean whites tried to git her away from marster she was
jesgwine to knock em on de head wid a gourd

The way this poor creatures eyes flashed and the tragic air with which
she struck at an imaginary mean white are among the most vivid things
in my memory of those days

To be frank my idea of the North was about as accurate as that
entertained by the welleducated Englishmen of the present day
concerning America I supposed the inhabitants were divided into two
classesIndians and white people that the Indians occasionally dashed
down on New York and scalped any woman or child giving the preference
to children whom they caught lingering in the outskirts after
nightfall that the white men were either hunters or schoolmasters and
that it was winter pretty much all the year round The prevailing style
of architecture I took to be logcabins

With this delightful picture of Northern civilization in my eye the
reader will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being
transported to Rivermouth to school and possibly will forgive me for
kicking over little black Sam and otherwise misconducting myself when
my father announced his determination to me As for kicking little SamI
always did that more or less gently when anything went wrong with me

My father was greatly perplexed and troubled by this unusually violent
outbreak and especially by the real consternation which he saw written
in every line of my countenance As little black Sam picked himself up
my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library

I can see him now as he leaned back in the bamboo chair and questioned
me He appeared strangely agitated on learning the nature of my
objections to going North and proceeded at once to knock down all my
pine log houses and scatter all the Indian tribes with which I had
populated the greater portion of the Eastern and Middle States

Who on earth Tom has filled your brain with such silly stories
asked my father wiping the tears from his eyes

Aunt Chloe sir she told me

And you really thought your grandfather wore a blanket embroidered with
beads and ornamented his leggins with the scalps of his enemies

Well sir I didnt think that exactly

Didnt think that exactly Tom you will be the death of me

He hid his face in his handkerchief and when he looked up he seemed
to have been suffering acutely I was deeply moved myself though I did
not clearly understand what I had said or done to cause him to feel so
badly Perhaps I had hurt his feelings by thinking it even possible that
Grandfather Nutter was an Indian warrior

My father devoted that evening and several subsequent evenings to giving
me a clear and succinct account of New England its early struggles its
progress and its present conditionfaint and confused glimmerings
of all which I had obtained at school where history had never been a
favorite pursuit of mine

I was no longer unwilling to go North on the contrary the proposed
journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights I promised
myself all sorts of fun and adventures though I was not entirely at
rest in my mind touching the savages and secretly resolved to go on
board the shipthe journey was to be made by seawith a certain little
brass pistol in my trouserspocket in case of any difficulty with the
tribes when we landed at Boston

I couldnt get the Indian out of my head Only a short time previously
the Cherokeesor was it the Camancheshad been removed from their
huntinggrounds in Arkansas and in the wilds of the Southwest the red
men were still a source of terror to the border settlers Trouble
with the Indians was the staple news from Florida published in the New
Orleans papers We were constantly hearing of travellers being attacked
and murdered in the interior of that State If these things were done in
Florida why not in Massachusetts

Yet long before the sailing day arrived I was eager to be off My
impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me
a fine little Mustang pony and shipped it to Rivermouth a fortnight
previous to the date set for our own departurefor both my parents were
to accompany me The pony which nearly kicked me out of bed one night
in a dream and my fathers promise that he and my mother would come to
Rivermouth every other summer completely resigned me to the situation
The ponys name was Gitana which is the Spanish for gypsy so I always
called hershe was a lady ponyGypsy

At length the time came to leave the vinecovered mansion among the
orangetrees to say goodby to little black Sam I am convinced he was
heartily glad to get rid of me and to part with simple Aunt Chloe
who in the confusion of her grief kissed an eyelash into my eye and
then buried her face in the bright bandana turban which she had mounted
that morning in honor of our departure

I fancy them standing by the open garden gate the tears are rolling
down Aunt Chloes cheeks Sams six front teeth are glistening like
pearls I wave my hand to him manfully then I call out goodby in a
muffled voice to Aunt Chloe they and the old home fade away I am never
to see them again




Chapter ThreeOn Board the Typhoon


I do not remember much about the voyage to Boston for after the first
few hours at sea I was dreadfully unwell

The name of our ship was the A No 1 fastsailing packet Typhoon
I learned afterwards that she sailed fast only in the newspaper
advertisements My father owned one quarter of the Typhoon and that is
why we happened to go in her I tried to guess which quarter of the ship
he owned and finally concluded it must be the hind quarterthe cabin
in which we had the cosiest of staterooms with one round window in the
roof and two shelves or boxes nailed up against the wall to sleep in

There was a good deal of confusion on deck while we were getting under
way The captain shouted orders to which nobody seemed to pay any
attention through a battered tin trumpet and grew so red in the face
that he reminded me of a scoopedout pumpkin with a lighted candle
inside He swore right and left at the sailors without the slightest
regard for their feelings They didnt mind it a bit however but went
on singing

 Heave ho
 With the rum below
 And hurrah for the Spanish Main O

I will not be positive about the Spanish Main but it was hurrah for
something O I considered them very jolly fellows and so indeed they
were One weatherbeaten tar in particular struck my fancya thickset
jovial man about fifty years of age with twinkling blue eyes and a
fringe of gray hair circling his head like a crown As he took off his
tarpaulin I observed that the top of his head was quite smooth and flat
as if somebody had sat down on him when he was very young

There was something noticeably hearty in this mans bronzed face a
heartiness that seemed to extend to his loosely knotted neckerchief But
what completely won my goodwill was a picture of enviable loveliness
painted on his left arm It was the head of a woman with the body of a
fish Her flowing hair was of livid green and she held a pink comb in
one hand I never saw anything so beautiful I determined to know that
man I think I would have given my brass pistol to have had such a
picture painted on my arm

While I stood admiring this work of art a fat wheezy steamtug with
the word AJAX in staring black letters on the paddlebox came puffing up
alongside the Typhoon It was ridiculously small and conceited compared
with our stately ship I speculated as to what it was going to do In a
few minutes we were lashed to the little monster which gave a snort and
a shriek and commenced backing us out from the levee wharf with the
greatest ease

I once saw an ant running away with a piece of cheese eight or ten times
larger than itself I could not help thinking of it when I found the
chubby smokynosed tugboat towing the Typhoon out into the Mississippi
River

In the middle of the stream we swung round the current caught us and
away we flew like a great winged bird Only it didnt seem as if we were
moving The shore with the countless steamboats the tangled rigging of
the ships and the long lines of warehouses appeared to be gliding away
from us

It was grand sport to stand on the quarterdeck and watch all this
Before long there was nothing to be seen on other side but stretches of
low swampy land covered with stunted cypress trees from which drooped
delicate streamers of Spanish mossa fine place for alligators and Congo
snakes Here and there we passed a yellow sandbar and here and there a
snag lifted its nose out of the water like a shark

This is your last chance to see the city To see the city Tom said
my father as we swept round a bend of the river

I turned and looked New Orleans was just a colorless mass of something
in the distance and the dome of the St Charles Hotel upon which
the sun shimmered for a moment was no bigger than the top of old Aunt
Chloes thimble

What do I remember next The gray sky and the fretful blue waters of the
Gulf The steamtug had long since let slip her hawsers and gone panting
away with a derisive scream as much as to say Ive done my duty now
look out for yourself old Typhoon

The ship seemed quite proud of being left to take care of itself and
with its huge white sails bulged out strutted off like a vain turkey
I had been standing by my father near the wheelhouse all this while
observing things with that nicety of perception which belongs only
to children but now the dew began falling and we went below to have
supper

The fresh fruit and milk and the slices of cold chicken looked very
nice yet somehow I had no appetite There was a general smell of tar
about everything Then the ship gave sudden lurches that made it a
matter of uncertainty whether one was going to put his fork to his mouth
or into his eye The tumblers and wineglasses stuck in a rack over the
table kept clinking and clinking and the cabin lamp suspended by four
gilt chains from the ceiling swayed to and fro crazily Now the floor
seemed to rise and now it seemed to sink under ones feet like a
featherbed

There were not more than a dozen passengers on board including
ourselves and all of these excepting a baldheaded old gentlemana
retired seacaptaindisappeared into their staterooms at an early hour
of the evening

After supper was cleared away my father and the elderly gentleman
whose name was Captain Truck played at checkers and I amused myself
for a while by watching the trouble they had in keeping the men in the
proper places Just at the most exciting point of the game the ship
would careen and down would go the white checkers pellmell among the
black Then my father laughed but Captain Truck would grow very angry
and vow that he would have won the game in a move or two more if
the confounded old chickencoopthats what he called the shiphadnt
lurched

II think I will go to bed now please I said laying my band on my
fathers knee and feeling exceedingly queer

It was high time for the Typhoon was plunging about in the most
alarming fashion I was speedily tucked away in the upper berth where
I felt a trifle more easy at first My clothes were placed on a narrow
shelf at my feet and it was a great comfort to me to know that my
pistol was so handy for I made no doubt we should fall in with
Pirates before many hours This is the last thing I remember with any
distinctness At midnight as I was afterwards told we were struck by
a gale which never left us until we came in sight of the Massachusetts
coast

For days and days I had no sensible idea of what was going on around me
That we were being hurled somewhere upsidedown and that I didnt like
it was about all I knew I have indeed a vague impression that my
father used to climb up to the berth and call me his Ancient Mariner
bidding me cheer up But the Ancient Mariner was far from cheering up
if I recollect rightly and I dont believe that venerable navigator
would have cared much if it had been announced to him through a
speakingtrumpet that a low black suspicious craft with raking
masts was rapidly bearing down upon us

In fact one morning I thought that such was the case for bang went
the big cannon I had noticed in the bow of the ship when we came on
board and which had suggested to me the idea of Pirates Bang went
the gun again in a few seconds I made a feeble effort to get at my
trouserspocket But the Typhoon was only saluting Cape Codthe
first land sighted by vessels approaching the coast from a southerly
direction

The vessel had ceased to roll and my seasickness passed away as
rapidly as it came I was all right now only a little shaky in my
timbers and a little blue about the gills as Captain Truck remarked to
my mother who like myself had been confined to the stateroom during
the passage

At Cape Cod the wind parted company with us without saying as much
as Excuse me so we were nearly two days in making the run which in
favorable weather is usually accomplished in seven hours Thats what
the pilot said

I was able to go about the ship now and I lost no time in cultivating
the acquaintance of the sailor with the greenhaired lady on his arm
I found him in the forecastlea sort of cellar in the front part of the
vessel He was an agreeable sailor as I had expected and we became the
best of friends in five minutes

He had been all over the world two or three times and knew no end of
stories According to his own account he must have been shipwrecked
at least twice a year ever since his birth He had served under Decatur
when that gallant officer peppered the Algerines and made them promise
not to sell their prisoners of war into slavery he had worked a gun
at the bombardment of Vera Cruz in the Mexican War and he had been on
Alexander Selkirks Island more than once There were very few things he
hadnt done in a seafaring way

I suppose sir I remarked that your name isnt Typhoon

Why Lord love ye lad my names Benjamin Watson of Nantucket But
Im a true blue Typhooner he added which increased my respect for
him I dont know why and I didnt know then whether Typhoon was the
name of a vegetable or a profession

Not wishing to be outdone in frankness I disclosed to him that my name
was Tom Bailey upon which he said he was very glad to hear it

When we got more intimate I discovered that Sailor Ben as he wished
me to call him was a perfect walking picturebook He had two anchors a
star and a frigate in full sail on his right arm a pair of lovely blue
hands clasped on his breast and Ive no doubt that other parts of his
body were illustrated in the same agreeable manner I imagine he was
fond of drawings and took this means of gratifying his artistic taste
It was certainly very ingenious and convenient A portfolio might
be misplaced or dropped overboard but Sailor Ben had his pictures
wherever he went just as that eminent person in the poem

With rings on her fingers and bells on her toeswas accompanied by
music on all occasions

The two bands on his breast he informed me were a tribute to the
memory of a dead messmate from whom he had parted years agoand surely a
more touching tribute was never engraved on a tombstone This caused me
to think of my parting with old Aunt Chloe and I told him I should take
it as a great favor indeed if he would paint a pink hand and a black
hand on my chest He said the colors were pricked into the skin with
needles and that the operation was somewhat painful I assured him in
an offhand manner that I didnt mind pain and begged him to set to
work at once

The simplehearted fellow who was probably not a little vain of his
skill took me into the forecastle and was on the point of complying
with my request when my father happened to own the gangwaya
circumstance that rather interfered with the decorative art

I didnt have another opportunity of conferring alone with Sailor Ben
for the next morning bright and early we came in sight of the cupola
of the Boston State House




Chapter FourRivermouth


It was a beautiful May morning when the Typhoon hauled up at Long Wharf
Whether the Indians were not early risers or whether they were away
just then on a warpath I couldnt determine but they did not appear
in any great forcein fact did not appear at all

In the remarkable geography which I never hurt myself with studying
at New Orleans was a picture representing the landing of the Pilgrim
Fathers at Plymouth The Pilgrim Fathers in rather odd hats and coats
are seen approaching the savages the savages in no coats or hats
to speak of are evidently undecided whether to shake hands with the
Pilgrim Fathers or to make one grand rush and scalp the entire party
Now this scene had so stamped itself on my mind that in spite of
all my father had said I was prepared for some such greeting from
the aborigines Nevertheless I was not sorry to have my expectations
unfulfilled By the way speaking of the Pilgrim Fathers I often used
to wonder why there was no mention made of the Pilgrim Mothers

While our trunks were being hoisted from the hold of the ship I mounted
on the roof of the cabin and took a critical view of Boston As we came
up the harbor I had noticed that the houses were huddled together on an
immense bill at the top of which was a large building the State House
towering proudly above the rest like an amiable motherhen surrounded
by her brood of manycolored chickens A closer inspection did not
impress me very favorably The city was not nearly so imposing as New
Orleans which stretches out for miles and miles in the shape of a
crescent along the banks of the majestic river

I soon grew tired of looking at the masses of houses rising above one
another in irregular tiers and was glad my father did not propose
to remain long in Boston As I leaned over the rail in this mood a
measlylooking little boy with no shoes said that if I would come down
on the wharf hed lick me for two centsnot an exorbitant price But I
didnt go down I climbed into the rigging and stared at him This as
I was rejoiced to observe so exasperated him that he stood on his head
on a pile of boards in order to pacify himself

The first train for Rivermouth left at noon After a late breakfast
on board the Typhoon our trunks were piled upon a baggagewagon and
ourselves stowed away in a coach which must have turned at least one
hundred corners before it set us down at the railway station

In less time than it takes to tell it we were shooting across the
country at a fearful ratenow clattering over a bridge now screaming
through a tunnel here we cut a flourishing village in two like a
knife and here we dived into the shadow of a pine forest Sometimes
we glided along the edge of the ocean and could see the sails of ships
twinkling like bits of silver against the horizon sometimes we dashed
across rocky pasturelands where stupideyed cattle were loafing It was
fun to scare lazylooking cows that lay round in groups under the newly
budded trees near the railroad track

We did not pause at any of the little brown stations on the route they
looked just like overgrown blackwalnut clocks though at every one of
them a man popped out as if he were worked by machinery and waved a red
flag and appeared as though he would like to have us stop But we were
an express train and made no stoppages excepting once or twice to give
the engine a drink It is strange how the memory clings to some things
It is over twenty years since I took that first ride to Rivermouth
and yet oddly enough I remember as if it were yesterday that as we
passed slowly through the village of Hampton we saw two boys fighting
behind a red barn There was also a shaggy yellow dog who looked as
if he had commenced to unravel barking himself all up into a knot with
excitement We had only a hurried glimpse of the battlelong enough
however to see that the combatants were equally matched and very much
in earnest I am ashamed to say how many times since I have speculated
as to which boy got licked Maybe both the small rascals are dead now
not in consequence of the setto let us hope or maybe they are
married and have pugnacious urchins of their own yet to this day I
sometimes find myself wondering how that fight turned out

We had been riding perhaps two hours and a half when we shot by a tall
factory with a chimney resembling a church steeple then the locomotive
gave a scream the engineer rang his bell and we plunged into the
twilight of a long wooden building open at both ends Here we stopped
and the conductor thrusting his head in at the car door cried out
Passengers for Rivermouth

At last we had reached our journeys end On the platform my father
shook hands with a straight brisk old gentleman whose face was very
serene and rosy He had on a white hat and a long swallowtailed coat
the collar of which came clear up above his cars He didnt look unlike
a Pilgrim Father This of course was Grandfather Nutter at whose
house I was born My mother kissed him a great many times and I was
glad to see him myself though I naturally did not feel very intimate
with a person whom I had not seen since I was eighteen months old

While we were getting into the doubleseated wagon which Grandfather
Nutter had provided I took the opportunity of asking after the health
of the pony The pony had arrived all right ten days before and was in
the stable at home quite anxious to see me

As we drove through the quiet old town I thought Rivermouth the
prettiest place in the world and I think so still The streets are long
and wide shaded by gigantic American elms whose drooping branches
interlacing here and there span the avenues with arches graceful
enough to be the handiwork of fairies Many of the houses have small
flowergardens in front gay in the season with chinaasters and are
substantially built with massive chimneystacks and protruding eaves
A beautiful river goes rippling by the town and after turning and
twisting among a lot of tiny islands empties itself into the sea

The harbor is so fine that the largest ships can sail directly up to
the wharves and drop anchor Only they dont Years ago it was a famous
seaport Princely fortunes were made in the West India trade and in
1812 when we were at war with Great Britain any number of privateers
were fitted out at Rivermouth to prey upon the merchant vessels of the
enemy Certain people grew suddenly and mysteriously rich A great many
of the first families of today do not care to trace their pedigree
back to the time when their grandsires owned shares in the Matilda Jane
twentyfour guns Well well

Few ships come to Rivermouth now Commerce drifted into other ports The
phantom fleet sailed off one day and never came back again The crazy
old warehouses are empty and barnacles and eelgrass cling to the piles
of the crumbling wharves where the sunshine lies lovingly bringing
out the faint spicy odor that haunts the placethe ghost of the old dead
West India trade During our ride from the station I was struck of
course only by the general neatness of the houses and the beauty of
the elmtrees lining the streets I describe Rivermouth now as I came to
know it afterwards

Rivermouth is a very ancient town In my day there existed a tradition
among the boys that it was here Christopher Columbus made his first
landing on this continent I remember having the exact spot pointed out
to me by Pepper Whitcomb One thing is certain Captain John Smith who
afterwards according to the legend married Pocahontaswhereby he got
Powhatan for a fatherinlawexplored the river in 1614 and was much
charmed by the beauty of Rivermouth which at that time was covered with
wild strawberryvines

Rivermouth figures prominently in all the colonial histories Every
other house in the place has its tradition more or less grim and
entertaining If ghosts could flourish anywhere there are certain
streets in Rivermouth that would be full of them I dont know of a town
with so many old houses Let us linger for a moment in front of the
one which the Oldest Inhabitant is always sure to point out to the
curious stranger

It is a square wooden edifice with gambrel roof and deepset
windowframes Over the windows and doors there used to be heavy
carvingsoakleaves and acorns and angels heads with wings spreading
from the ears oddly jumbled together but these ornaments and other
outward signs of grandeur have long since disappeared A peculiar
interest attaches itself to this house not because of its age for
it has not been standing quite a century nor on account of its
architecture which is not strikingbut because of the illustrious men
who at various periods have occupied its spacious chambers

In 1770 it was an aristocratic hotel At the left side of the entrance
stood a high post from which swung the sign of the Earl of Halifax The
landlord was a stanch loyalistthat is to say he believed in the king
and when the overtaxed colonies determined to throw off the British
yoke the adherents to the Crown held private meetings in one of the
back rooms of the tavern This irritated the rebels as they were
called and one night they made an attack on the Earl of Halifax tore
down the signboard broke in the windowsashes and gave the landlord
hardly time to make himself invisible over a fence in the rear

For several months the shattered tavern remained deserted At last the
exiled innkeeper on promising to do better was allowed to return a
new sign bearing the name of William Pitt the friend of America swung
proudly from the doorpost and the patriots were appeased Here it was
that the mailcoach from Boston twice a week for many a year set
down its load of travelers and gossip For some of the details in this
sketch I am indebted to a recently published chronicle of those times

It is 1782 The French fleet is lying in the harbor of Rivermouth and
eight of the principal officers in white uniforms trimmed with gold
lace have taken up their quarters at the sign of the William Pitt Who
is this young and handsome officer now entering the door of the tavern
It is no less a personage than the Marquis Lafayette who has come all
the way from Providence to visit the French gentlemen boarding there
What a gallantlooking cavalier he is with his quick eyes and coal
black hair Forty years later he visited the spot again his locks were
gray and his step was feeble but his heart held its young love for
Liberty

Who is this finely dressed traveler alighting from his coachandfour
attended by servants in livery Do you know that sounding name written
in big valorous letters on the Declaration of Independencewritten as
if by the hand of a giant Can you not see it now JOHN HANCOCK This is
he

Three young men with their valet are standing on the doorstep of the
William Pitt bowing politely and inquiring in the most courteous terms
in the world if they can be accommodated It is the time of the French
Revolution and these are three sons of the Duke of OrleansLouis
Philippe and his two brothers Louis Philippe never forgot his visit
to Rivermouth Years afterwards when he was seated on the throne of
France he asked an American lady who chanced to be at his court if
the pleasant old mansion were still standing

But a greater and a better man than the king of the French has honored
this roof Here in 1789 came George Washington the President of
the United States to pay his final complimentary visit to the State
dignitaries The wainscoted chamber where he slept and the dininghall
where he entertained his guests have a certain dignity and sanctity
which even the present Irish tenants cannot wholly destroy

During the period of my reign at Rivermouth an ancient lady Dame
Jocelyn by name lived in one of the upper rooms of this notable
building She was a dashing young belle at the time of Washingtons
first visit to the town and must have been exceedingly coquettish and
pretty judging from a certain portrait on ivory still in the possession
of the family According to Dame Jocelyn George Washington flirted with
her just a little bitin what a stately and highly finished manner can
be imagined

There was a mirror with a deep filigreed frame hanging over the
mantelpiece in this room The glass was cracked and the quicksilver
rubbed off or discolored in many places When it reflected your face
you had the singular pleasure of not recognizing yourself It gave your
features the appearance of having been run through a mincemeat machine
But what rendered the lookingglass a thing of enchantment to me was a
faded green feather tipped with scarlet which drooped from the top
of the tarnished gilt mouldings This feather Washington took from the
plume of his threecornered hat and presented with his own hand to the
worshipful Mistress Jocelyn the day he left Rivermouth forever I wish
I could describe the mincing genteel air and the illconcealed
selfcomplacency with which the dear old lady related the incident

Many a Saturday afternoon have I climbed up the rickety staircase to
that dingy room which always had a flavor of snuff about it to sit
on a stiffbacked chair and listen for hours together to Dame Jocelyns
stories of the olden time How she would prattle She was bedriddenpoor
creatureand had not been out of the chamber for fourteen years
Meanwhile the world had shot ahead of Dame Jocelyn The changes that had
taken place under her very nose were unknown to this faded crooning old
gentlewoman whom the eighteenth century had neglected to take away with
the rest of its odd traps She had no patience with newfangled notions
The old ways and the old times were good enough for her She had never
seen a steam engine though she had heard the dratted thing screech in
the distance In her day when gentlefolk traveled they went in
their own coaches She didnt see how respectable people could bring
themselves down to riding in a car with ragtag and bobtail and
Lordknowswho Poor old aristocrat The landlord charged her no rent
for the room and the neighbors took turns in supplying her with meals
Towards the close of her lifeshe lived to be ninetynineshe grew very
fretful and capricious about her food If she didnt chance to fancy
what was sent her she had no hesitation in sending it back to the giver
with Miss Jocelyns respectful compliments

But I have been gossiping too longand yet not too long if I have
impressed upon the reader an idea of what a rusty delightful old town
it was to which I had come to spend the next three or four years of my
boyhood

A drive of twenty minutes from the station brought us to the doorstep
of Grandfather Nutters house What kind of house it was and what sort
of people lived in it shall be told in another chapter




Chapter FiveThe Nutter House and the Nutter Family


The Nutter Houseall the more prominent dwellings in Rivermouth are
named after somebody for instance there is the Walford House the
Venner House the Trefethen House etc though it by no means follows
that they are inhabited by the people whose names they bearthe Nutter
House to resume has been in our family nearly a hundred years and
is an honor to the builder an ancestor of ours I believe supposing
durability to be a merit If our ancestor was a carpenter he knew his
trade I wish I knew mine as well Such timber and such workmanship
dont often come together in houses built nowadays

Imagine a lowstudded structure with a wide hall running through the
middle At your right band as you enter stands a tall black mahogany
clock looking like an Egyptian mummy set up on end On each side of
the hall are doors whose knobs it must be confessed do not turn very
easily opening into large rooms wainscoted and rich in woodcarvings
about the mantelpieces and cornices The walls are covered with
pictured paper representing landscapes and seaviews In the parlor
for example this enlivening figure is repeated all over the room A
group of English peasants wearing Italian hats are dancing on a lawn
that abruptly resolves itself into a seabeach upon which stands a
flabby fisherman nationality unknown quietly hauling in what appears
to be a small whale and totally regardless of the dreadful naval combat
going on just beyond the end of his fishingrod On the other side of
the ships is the mainland again with the same peasants dancing
Our ancestors were very worthy people but their wallpapers were
abominable

There are neither grates nor stoves in these quaint chambers but
splendid open chimneyplaces with room enough for the corpulent
backlog to turn over comfortably on the polished andirons A wide
staircase leads from the hall to the second story which is arranged
much like the first Over this is the garret I neednt tell a
New England boy whata museum of curiosities is the garret of a
wellregulated New England house of fifty or sixty years standing
Here meet together as if by some preconcerted arrangement all the
brokendown chairs of the household all the spavined tables all
the seedy hats all the intoxicatedlooking boots all the split
walkingsticks that have retired from business weary with the march of
life The pots the pans the trunks the bottleswho may hope to
make an inventory of the numberless odds and ends collected in this
bewildering lumberroom But what a place it is to sit of an afternoon
with the rain pattering on the roof What a place in which to read
Gullivers Travels or the famous adventures of Rinaldo Rinaldini

My grandfathers house stood a little back from the main street in
the shadow of two handsome elms whose overgrown boughs would dash
themselves against the gables whenever the wind blew hard In the rear
was a pleasant garden covering perhaps a quarter of an acre full of
plumtrees and gooseberry bushes These trees were old settlers and are
all dead now excepting one which bears a purple plum as big as an egg
This tree as I remark is still standing and a more beautiful tree
to tumble out of never grew anywhere In the northwestern corner of the
garden were the stables and carriagehouse opening upon a narrow lane
You may imagine that I made an early visit to that locality to inspect
Gypsy Indeed I paid her a visit every halfhour during the first day
of my arrival At the twentyfourth visit she trod on my foot rather
heavily as a reminder probably that I was wearing out my welcome She
was a knowing little pony that Gypsy and I shall have much to say of
her in the course of these pages

Gypsys quarters were all that could be wished but nothing among my new
surroundings gave me more satisfaction than the cosey sleeping apartment
that had been prepared for myself It was the hall room over the front
door

I had never had a chamber all to myself before and this one about
twice the size of our stateroom on board the Typhoon was a marvel of
neatness and comfort Pretty chintz curtains hung at the window and a
patch quilt of more colors than were in Josephs coat covered the little
trucklebed The pattern of the wallpaper left nothing to be desired in
that line On a gray background were small bunches of leaves unlike
any that ever grew in this world and on every other bunch perched a
yellowbird pitted with crimson spots as if it had just recovered from
a severe attack of the smallpox That no such bird ever existed did
not detract from my admiration of each one There were two hundred and
sixtyeight of these birds in all not counting those split in two where
the paper was badly joined I counted them once when I was laid up with
a fine black eye and falling asleep immediately dreamed that the whole
flock suddenly took wing and flew out of the window From that time I
was never able to regard them as merely inanimate objects

A washstand in the corner a chest of carved mahogany drawers a
lookingglass in a filigreed frame and a highbacked chair studded with
brass nails like a coffin constituted the furniture Over the head of
the bed were two oak shelves holding perhaps a dozen booksamong which
were Theodore or The Peruvians Robinson Crusoe an odd volume of
Tristram Shandy Baxters Saints Rest and a fine English edition of
the Arabian Nights with six hundred woodcuts by Harvey

Shall I ever forget the hour when I first overhauled these books I do
not allude especially to Baxters Saints Rest which is far from being
a lively work for the young but to the Arabian Nights and particularly
Robinson Crusoe The thrill that ran into my fingers ends then has not
run out yet Many a time did I steal up to this nest of a room
and taking the dogseared volume from its shelf glide off into an
enchanted realm where there were no lessons to get and no boys to
smash my kite In a lidless trunk in the garret I subsequently unearthed
another motley collection of novels and romances embracing the
adventures of Baron Trenck Jack Sheppard Don Quixote Gil Blas and
Charlotte Templeall of which I fed upon like a bookworm

I never come across a copy of any of those works without feeling a
certain tenderness for the yellowhaired little rascal who used to lean
above the magic pages hour after hour religiously believing every word
he read and no more doubting the reality of Sindbad the Sailor or the
Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance than he did the existence of his
own grandfather

Against the wall at the foot of the bed hung a singlebarrel
shotgunplaced there by Grandfather Nutter who knew what a boy
loved if ever a grandfather did As the trigger of the gun had been
accidentally twisted off it was not perhaps the most dangerous weapon
that could be placed in the hands of youth In this maimed condition
its bump of destructiveness was much less than that of my small brass
pocketpistol which I at once proceeded to suspend from one of the
nails supporting the fowlingpiece for my vagaries concerning the red
man had been entirely dispelled

Having introduced the reader to the Nutter House a presentation to the
Nutter family naturally follows The family consisted of my
grandfather his sister Miss Abigail Nutter and Kitty Collins the
maidofallwork

Grandfather Nutter was a hale cheery old gentleman as straight and as
bald as an arrow He had been a sailor in early life that is to say at
the age of ten years he fled from the multiplicationtable and ran away
to sea A single voyage satisfied him There never was but one of our
family who didnt run away to sea and this one died at his birth My
grandfather had also been a soldiera captain of militia in 1812 If I
owe the British nation anything I owe thanks to that particular British
soldier who put a musketball into the fleshy part of Captain Nutters
leg causing that noble warrior a slight permanent limp but offsetting
the injury by furnishing him with the material for a story which the old
gentleman was never weary of telling and I never weary of listening to
The story in brief was as follows

At the breaking out of the war an English frigate lay for several days
off the coast near Rivermouth A strong fort defended the harbor and a
regiment of minutemen scattered at various points alongshore stood
ready to repel the boats should the enemy try to effect a landing
Captain Nutter had charge of a slight earthwork just outside the mouth
of the river Late one thick night the sound of oars was heard the
sentinel tried to fire off his gun at halfcock and couldnt when
Captain Nutter sprung upon the parapet in the pitch darkness and
shouted Boat ahoyl A musketshot immediately embedded itself in the
calf of his leg The Captain tumbled into the fort and the boat which
had probably come in search of water pulled back to the frigate

This was my grandfathers only exploit during the war That his prompt
and bold conduct was instrumental in teaching the enemy the hopelessness
of attempting to conquer such a people was among the firm beliefs of my
boyhood

At the time I came to Rivermouth my grandfather had retired from active
pursuits and was living at ease on his money invested principally
in shipping He had been a widower many years a maiden sister the
aforesaid Miss Abigail managing his household Miss Abigail also
managed her brother and her brothers servant and the visitor at her
brothers gatenot in a tyrannical spirit but from a philanthropic
desire to be useful to everybody In person she was tall and angular
she had a gray complexion gray eyes gray eyebrows and generally wore
a gray dress Her strongest weak point was a belief in the efficacy of
hotdrops as a cure for all known diseases

If there were ever two people who seemed to dislike each other Miss
Abigail and Kitty Collins were those people If ever two people really
loved each other Miss Abigail and Kitty Collins were those people also
They were always either skirmishing or having a cup of tea lovingly
together

Miss Abigail was very fond of me and so was Kitty and in the course of
their disagreements each let me into the private history of the other

According to Kitty it was not originally my grandfathers intention
to have Miss Abigail at the head of his domestic establishment She had
swooped down on him Kittys own words with a bandbox in one hand and
a faded blue cotton umbrella still in existence in the other Clad
in this singular garbI do not remember that Kitty alluded toany
additional peculiarity of dressMiss Abigail had made her appearance at
the door of the Nutter House on the morning of my grandmothers funeral
The small amount of baggage which the lady brought with her would have
led the superficial observer to infer that Miss Abigails visit was
limited to a few days I run ahead of my story in saying she remained
seventeen years How much longer she would have remained can never be
definitely known now as she died at the expiration of that period

Whether or not my grandfather was quite pleased by this unlookedfor
addition to his family is a problem He was very kind always to Miss
Abigail and seldom opposed her though I think she must have tried his
patience sometimes especially when she interfered with Kitty

Kitty Collins or Mrs Catherine as she preferred to be called
was descended in a direct line from an extensive family of kings who
formerly ruled over Ireland In consequence of various calamities
among which the failure of the potatocrop may be mentioned Miss
Kitty Collins in company with several hundred of her countrymen and
countrywomenalso descended from kingscame over to America in an
emigrant ship in the year eighteen hundred and something

I dont know what freak of fortune caused the royal exile to turn up
at Rivermouth but turn up she did a few months after arriving in this
country and was hired by my grandmother to do general housework for
the sum of four shillings and sixpence a week

Kitty had been living about seven years in my grandfathers family when
she unburdened her heart of a secret which had been weighing upon it all
that time It may be said of people as it is said of nations Happy
are they that have no history Kitty had a history and a pathetic one
I think

On board the emigrant ship that brought her to America she became
acquainted with a sailor who being touched by Kittys forlorn
condition was very good to her Long before the end of the voyage
which had been tedious and perilous she was heartbroken at the thought
of separating from her kindly protector but they were not to part just
yet for the sailor returned Kittys affection and the two were married
on their arrival at port Kittys husbandshe would never mention his
name but kept it locked in her bosom like some precious relichad a
considerable sum of money when the crew were paid off and the young
couplefor Kitty was young thenlived very happily in a lodginghouse on
South Street near the docks This was in New York

The days flew by like hours and the stocking in which the little bride
kept the funds shrunk and shrunk until at last there were only three
or four dollars left in the toe of it Then Kitty was troubled for
she knew her sailor would have to go to sea again unless he could
get employment on shore This he endeavored to do but not with much
success One morning as usual he kissed her good day and set out in
search of work

Kissed me goodby and called me his little Irish lass sobbed Kitty
telling the story kissed me goodby and Heaven help me I niver set
oi on him nor on the likes of him again

He never came back Day after day dragged on night after night and
then the weary weeks What had become of him Had he been murdered Had
he fallen into the docks Had hedeserted her No She could not believe
that he was too brave and tender and true She couldnt believe that
He was dead dead or hed come back to her

Meanwhile the landlord of the lodginghouse turned Kitty into the
streets now that her man was gone and the payment of the rent
doubtful She got a place as a servant The family she lived with
shortly moved to Boston and she accompanied them then they went
abroad but Kitty would not leave America Somehow she drifted to
Rivermouth and for seven long years never gave speech to her sorrow
until the kindness of strangers who had become friends to her unsealed
the heroic lips

Kittys story you may be sure made my grandparents treat her more
kindly than ever In time she grew to be regarded less as a servant than
as a friend in the home circle sharing its joys and sorrowsa faithful
nurse a willing slave a happy spirit in spite of all I fancy I hear
her singing over her work in the kitchen pausing from time to time to
make some witty reply to Miss Abigailfor Kitty like all her race had
a vein of unconscious humor Her bright honest face comes to me out from
the past the light and life of the Nutter House when I was a boy at
Rivermouth




Chapter SixLights and Shadows


The first shadow that fell upon me in my new home was caused by the
return of my parents to New Orleans Their visit was cut short by
business which required my fathers presence in Natchez where he was
establishing a branch of the bankinghouse When they had gone a sense
of loneliness such as I had never dreamed of filled my young breast
I crept away to the stable and throwing my arms about Gypsys neck
sobbed aloud She too had come from the sunny South and was now a
stranger in a strange land

The little mare seemed to realize our situation and gave me all the
sympathy I could ask repeatedly rubbing her soft nose over my face and
lapping up my salt tears with evident relish

When night came I felt still more lonesome My grandfather sat in
his armchair the greater part of the evening reading the Rivermouth
Bamacle the local newspaper There was no gas in those days and the
Captain read by the aid of a small blocktin lamp which he held in one
hand I observed that he had a habit of dropping off into a doze every
three or four minutes and I forgot my homesickness at intervals in
watching him Two or three times to my vast amusement he scorched the
edges of the newspaper with the wick of the lamp and at about half
past eight oclock I had the satisfactionsI am sorry to confess it was a
satisfactionof seeing the Rivermouth Barnacle in flames

My grandfather leisurely extinguished the fire with his hands and Miss
Abigail who sat near a low table knitting by the light of an astral
lamp did not even look up She was quite used to this catastrophe

There was little or no conversation during the evening In fact I do
not remember that anyone spoke at all excepting once when the Captain
remarked in a meditative manner that my parents must have reached New
York by this time at which supposition I nearly strangled myself in
attempting to intercept a sob

The monotonous click click of Miss Abigails needles made me nervous
after a while and finally drove me out of the sittingroom into the
kitchen where Kitty caused me to laugh by saying Miss Abigail thought
that what I needed was a good dose of hotdrops a remedy she was
forever ready to administer in all emergencies If a boy broke his
leg or lost his mother I believe Miss Abigail would have given him
hotdrops

Kitty laid herself out to be entertaining She told me several funny
Irish stories and described some of the odd people living in the town
but in the midst of her comicalities the tears would involuntarily
ooze out of my eyes though I was not a lad much addicted to weeping
Then Kitty would put her arms around me and tell me not to mind itthat
it wasnt as if I had been left alone in a foreign land with no one to
care for me like a poor girl whom she had once known I brightened up
before long and told Kitty all about the Typhoon and the old seaman
whose name I tried in vain to recall and was obliged to fall back on
plain Sailor Ben

I was glad when ten oclock came the bedtime for young folks and old
folks too at the Nutter House Alone in the hallchamber I had my cry
out once for all moistening the pillow to such an extent that I was
obliged to turn it over to find a dry spot to go to sleep on

My grandfather wisely concluded to put me to school at once If I had
been permitted to go mooning about the house and stables I should have
kept my discontent alive for months The next morning accordingly he
took me by the hand and we set forth for the academy which was located
at the farther end of the town

The Temple School was a twostory brick building standing in the centre
of a great square piece of land surrounded by a high picket fence
There were three or four sickly trees but no grass in this enclosure
which had been worn smooth and hard by the tread of multitudinous feet
I noticed here and there small holes scooped in the ground indicating
that it was the season for marbles A better playground for baseball
couldnt have been devised

On reaching the schoolhouse door the Captain inquired for Mr Grimshaw
The boy who answered our knock ushered us into a sideroom and in a
few minutesduring which my eye took in fortytwo caps hung on fortytwo
wooden pegsMr Grimshaw made his appearance He was a slender man with
white fragile hands and eyes that glanced half a dozen different ways
at oncea habit probably acquired from watching the boys

After a brief consultation my grandfather patted me on the head and
left me in charge of this gentleman who seated himself in front of
me and proceeded to sound the depth or more properly speaking the
shallowness of my attainments I suspect my historical information
rather startled him I recollect I gave him to understand that Richard
III was the last king of England

This ordeal over Mr Grimshaw rose and bade me follow him A door
opened and I stood in the blaze of fortytwo pairs of upturned eyes
I was a cool hand for my age but I lacked the boldness to face this
battery without wincing In a sort of dazed way I stumbled after Mr
Grimshaw down a narrow aisle between two rows of desks and shyly took
the seat pointed out to me

The faint buzz that had floated over the schoolroom at our entrance
died away and the interrupted lessons were resumed By degrees I
recovered my coolness and ventured to look around me

The owners of the fortytwo caps were seated at small green desks like
the one assigned to me The desks were arranged in six rows with spaces
between just wide enough to prevent the boys whispering A blackboard
set into the wall extended clear across the end of the room on a raised
platform near the door stood the masters table and directly in front
of this was a recitationbench capable of seating fifteen or twenty
pupils A pair of globes tattooed with dragons and winged horses
occupied a shelf between two windows which were so high from the floor
that nothing but a giraffe could have looked out of them

Having possessed myself of these details I scrutinized my new
acquaintances with unconcealed curiosity instinctively selecting my
friends and picking out my enemiesand in only two cases did I mistake
my man

A sallow boy with bright red hair sitting in the fourth row shook
his fist at me furtively several times during the morning I had a
presentiment I should have trouble with that boy some daya presentiment
subsequently realized

On my left was a chubby little fellow with a great many freckles this
was Pepper Whitcomb who made some mysterious motions to me I didnt
understand them but as they were clearly of a pacific nature I winked
my eye at him This appeared to be satisfactory for he then went on
with his studies At recess he gave me the core of his apple though
there were several applicants for it

Presently a boy in a loose olivegreen jacket with two rows of brass
buttons held up a folded paper behind his slate intimating that it was
intended for me The paper was passed skillfully from desk to desk until
it reached my hands On opening the scrap I found that it contained
a small piece of molasses candy in an extremely humid state This was
certainly kind I nodded my acknowledgments and hastily slipped the
delicacy into my mouth In a second I felt my tongue grow redhot with
cayenne pepper

My face must have assumed a comical expression for the boy in the
olivegreen jacket gave an hysterical laugh for which he was instantly
punished by Mr Grimshaw I swallowed the fiery candy though it brought
the water to my eyes and managed to look so unconcerned that I was
the only pupil in the form who escaped questioning as to the cause of
Mardens misdemeanor C Marden was his name

Nothing else occurred that morning to interrupt the exercises excepting
that a boy in the reading class threw us all into convulsions by calling
Absalom Abolsom Abolsom O my son Abolsom I laughed as loud as
anyone but I am not so sure that I shouldnt have pronounced it Abolsom
myself

At recess several of the scholars came to my desk and shook hands with
me Mr Grimshaw having previously introduced me to Phil Adams charging
him to see that I got into no trouble My new acquaintances suggested
that we should go to the playground We were no sooner outofdoors than
the boy with the red hair thrust his way through the crowd and placed
himself at my side

I say youngster if youre comin to this school youve got to toe the
mark

I didnt see any mark to toe and didnt understand what he meant but I
replied politely that if it was the custom of the school I should be
happy to toe the mark if he would point it out to me

I dont want any of your sarse said the boy scowling

Look here Conway cried a clear voice from the other side of the
playground You let young Bailey alone Hes a stranger here and might
be afraid of you and thrash you Why do you always throw yourself in
the way of getting thrashed

I turned to the speaker who by this time had reached the spot where we
stood Conway slunk off favoring me with a parting scowl of defiance
I gave my hand to the boy who had befriended mehis name was Jack
Harrisand thanked him for his goodwill

I tell you what it is Bailey he said returning my pressure
goodnaturedly youll have to fight Conway before the quarter ends
or youll have no rest That fellow is always hankering after a licking
and of course youll give him one by and by but whats the use of
hurrying up an unpleasant job Lets have some baseball By the way
Bailey you were a good kid not to let on to Grimshaw about the candy
Charley Marden would have caught it twice as heavy Hes sorry he played
the joke on you and told me to tell you so Hallo Blake Where are the
bats

This was addressed to a handsome franklooking lad of about my own age
who was engaged just then in cutting his initials on the bark of a tree
near the schoolhouse Blake shut up his penknife and went off to get the
bats

During the game which ensued I made the acquaintance of Charley Marden
Binny Wallace Pepper Whitcomb Harry Blake and Fred Langdon These
boys none of them more than a year or two older than I Binny Wallace
was younger were ever after my chosen comrades Phil Adams and Jack
Harris were considerably our seniors and though they always treated
us kids very kindly they generally went with another set Of course
before long I knew all the Temple boys more or less intimately but the
five I have named were my constant companions

My first day at the Temple Grammar School was on the whole satisfactory
I had made several warm friends and only two permanent enemiesConway
and his echo Seth Rodgers for these two always went together like a
deranged stomach and a headache

Before the end of the week I had my studies well in hand I was a
little ashamed at finding myself at the foot of the various classes and
secretly determined to deserve promotion The school was an admirable
one I might make this part of my story more entertaining by picturing
Mr Grimshaw as a tyrant with a red nose and a large stick but
unfortunately for the purposes of sensational narrative Mr Grimshaw
was a quiet kindhearted gentleman Though a rigid disciplinarian he
had a keen sense of justice was a good reader of character and the
boys respected him There were two other teachersa French tutor and a
writingmaster who visited the school twice a week On Wednesdays and
Saturdays we were dismissed at noon and these halfholidays were the
brightest epochs of my existence

Daily contact with boys who had not been brought up as gently as I
worked an immediate and in some respects a beneficial change in my
character I had the nonsense taken out of me as the saying issome
of the nonsense at least I became more manly and selfreliant I
discovered that the world was not created exclusively on my account
In New Orleans I labored under the delusion that it was Having neither
brother nor sister to give up to at home and being moreover the
largest pupil at school there my will had seldom been opposed At
Rivermouth matters were different and I was not long in adapting myself
to the altered circumstances Of course I got many severe rubs often
unconsciously given but I had the sense to see that I was all the
better for them

My social relations with my new schoolfellows were the pleasantest
possible There was always some exciting excursion on foota ramble
through the pine woods a visit to the Devils Pulpit a high cliff
in the neighborhoodor a surreptitious low on the river involving
an exploration of a group of diminutive islands upon one of which we
pitched a tent and played we were the Spanish sailors who got wrecked
there years ago But the endless pine forest that skirted the town was
our favorite haunt There was a great green pond hidden somewhere in its
depths inhabited by a monstrous colony of turtles Harry Blake who
had an eccentric passion for carving his name on everything never let
a captured turtle slip through his fingers without leaving his mark
engraved on its shell He must have lettered about two thousand from
first to last We used to call them Harry Blakes sheep

These turtles were of a discontented and migratory turn of mind and we
frequently encountered two or three of them on the crossroads several
miles from their ancestral mud Unspeakable was our delight whenever we
discovered one soberly walking off with Harry Blakes initials Ive
no doubt there are at this moment fat ancient turtles wandering about
that gummy woodland with HB neatly cut on their venerable backs

It soon became a custom among my playmates to make our barn their
rendezvous Gypsy proved a strong attraction Captain Nutter bought me a
little twowheeled cart which she drew quite nicely after kicking out
the dasher and breaking the shafts once or twice With our lunchbaskets
and fishingtackle stowed away under the seat we used to start off
early in the afternoon for the seashore where there were countless
marvels in the shape of shells mosses and kelp Gypsy enjoyed the
sport as keenly as any of us even going so far one day as to trot
down the beach into the sea where we were bathing As she took the cart
with her our provisions were not much improved I shall never forget
how squashpie tastes after being soused in the Atlantic Ocean
Sodacrackers dipped in salt water are palatable but not squashpie

There was a good deal of wet weather during those first six weeks at
Rivermouth and we set ourselves at work to find some indoor amusement
for our halfholidays It was all very well for Amadis de Gaul and Don
Quixote not to mind the rain they had iron overcoats and were not
from all we can learn subject to croup and the guidance of their
grandfathers Our case was different

Now boys what shall we do I asked addressing a thoughtful conclave
of seven assembled in our barn one dismal rainy afternoon

Lets have a theatre suggested Binny Wallace

The very thing But where The loft of the stable was ready to burst
with hay provided for Gypsy but the long room over the carriagehouse
was unoccupied The place of all places My managerial eye saw at a
glance its capabilities for a theatre I had been to the play a great
many times in New Orleans and was wise in matters pertaining to the
drama So here in due time was set up some extraordinary scenery of my
own painting The curtain I recollect though it worked smoothly enough
on other occasions invariably hitched during the performances and it
often required the united energies of the Prince of Denmark the King
and the Gravedigger with an occasional band from the fair Ophelia
Pepper Whitcomb in a lownecked dress to hoist that bit of green
cambric

The theatre however was a success as far as it went I retired from
the business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins after deducting
the headless the pointless and the crooked pins with which our
doorkeeper frequently got stuck From first to last we took in a
great deal of this counterfeit money The price of admission to the
Rivermouth Theatre was twenty pins I played all the principal parts
myselfnot that I was a finer actor than the other boys but because I
owned the establishment

At the tenth representation my dramatic career was brought to a close
by an unfortunate circumstance We were playing the drama of William
Tell the Hero of Switzerland Of course I was William Tell in spite
of Fred Langdon who wanted to act that character himself I wouldnt
let him so he withdrew from the company taking the only bow and arrow
we had I made a crossbow out of a piece of whalebone and did very
well without him We had reached that exciting scene where Gessler the
Austrian tyrant commands Tell to shoot the apple from his sons head
Pepper Whitcomb who played all the juvenile and women parts was my
son To guard against mischance a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a
handkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcombs face while the arrow
to be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel I was a capital marksman
and the big apple only two yards distant turned its russet cheek
fairly towards me

I can see poor little Pepper now as he stood without flinching
waiting for me to perform my great feat I raised the crossbow amid the
breathless silence of the crowded audience consisting of seven boys and
three girls exclusive of Kitty Collins who insisted on paying her way
in with a clothespin I raised the crossbow I repeat Twang went the
whipcord but alas instead of hitting the apple the arrow flew right
into Pepper Whitcombs mouth which happened to be open at the time and
destroyed my aim

I shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory
Peppers roar expressive of astonishment indignation and pain is
still ringing in my cars I looked upon him as a corpse and glancing
not far into the dreary future pictured myself led forth to execution
in the presence of the very same spectators then assembled

Luckily poor Pepper was not seriously hurt but Grandfather Nutter
appearing in the midst of the confusion attracted by the howls of young
Tell issued an injunction against all theatricals thereafter and the
place was closed not however without a farewell speech from me in
which I said that this would have been the proudest moment of my life
if I hadnt hit Pepper Whitcomb in the mouth Whereupon the audience
assisted I am glad to state by Pepper cried Hear Hear I then
attributed the accident to Pepper himself whose mouth being open at
the instant I fired acted upon the arrow much after the fashion of a
whirlpool and drew in the fatal shaft I was about to explain how a
comparatively small maelstrom could suck in the largest ship when the
curtain fell of its own accord amid the shouts of the audience

This was my last appearance on any stage It was some time though
before I heard the end of the William Tell business Malicious little
boys who had not been allowed to buy tickets to my theatre used to cry
out after me in the street

 Who killed Cock Robin
 I said the sparrer
 With my bow and arrer
 I killed Cock Robin

The sarcasm of this verse was more than I could stand And it made
Pepper Whitcomb pretty mad to be called Cock Robin I can tell you

So the days glided on with fewer clouds and more sunshine than fall to
the lot of most boys Conway was certainly a cloud Within schoolbounds
he seldom ventured to be aggressive but whenever we met about town he
never failed to brush against me or pull my cap over my eyes or
drive me distracted by inquiring after my family in New Orleans always
alluding to them as highly respectable colored people

Jack Harris was right when he said Conway would give me no rest until I
fought him I felt it was ordained ages before our birth that we should
meet on this planet and fight With the view of not running counter to
destiny I quietly prepared myself for the impending conflict The scene
of my dramatic triumphs was turned into a gymnasium for this purpose
though I did not openly avow the fact to the boys By persistently
standing on my head raising heavy weights and going hand over hand up
a ladder I developed my muscle until my little body was as tough as a
hickory knot and as supple as tripe I also took occasional lessons in
the noble art of selfdefence under the tuition of Phil Adams

I brooded over the matter until the idea of fighting Conway became a
part of me I fought him in imagination during schoolhours I dreamed
of fighting with him at night when he would suddenly expand into a
giant twelve feet high and then as suddenly shrink into a pygmy so
small that I couldnt hit him In this latter shape he would get into
my hair or pop into my waistcoatpocket treating me with as little
ceremony as the Liliputians showed Captain Lemuel Gulliverall of which
was not pleasant to be sure On the whole Conway was a cloud

And then I had a cloud at home It was not Grandfather Nutter nor Miss
Abigail nor Kitty Collins though they all helped to compose it It
was a vague funereal impalpable something which no amount of gymnastic
training would enable me to knock over It was Sunday If ever I have
a boy to bring up in the way he should go I intend to make Sunday a
cheerful day to him Sunday was not a cheerful day at the Nutter House
You shall judge for yourself

It is Sunday morning I should premise by saying that the deep gloom
which has settled over everything set in like a heavy fog early on
Saturday evening

At seven oclock my grandfather comes smilelessly downstairs He is
dressed in black and looks as if he had lost all his friends during
the night Miss Abigail also in black looks as if she were prepared to
bury them and not indisposed to enjoy the ceremony Even Kitty Collins
has caught the contagious gloom as I perceive when she brings in the
coffeeurna solemn and sculpturesque urn at any time but monumental
nowand sets it down in front of Miss Abigail Miss Abigail gazes at
the urn as if it held the ashes of her ancestors instead of a generous
quantity of fine old Java coffee The meal progresses in silence

Our parlor is by no means thrown open every day It is open this June
morning and is pervaded by a strong smell of centretable The furniture
of the room and the little China ornaments on the mantelpiece have a
constrained unfamiliar look My grandfather sits in a mahogany chair
reading a large Bible covered with green baize Miss Abigail occupies
one end of the sofa and has her hands crossed stiffly in her lap I
sit in the corner crushed Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas are in close
confinement Baron Trenck who managed to escape from the fortress of
Clatz cant for the life of him get out of our sittingroom closet Even
the Rivermouth Barnacle is suppressed until Monday Genial converse
harmless books smiles lightsome hearts all are banished If I want to
read anything I can read Baxters Saints Rest I would die first So
I sit there kicking my heels thinking about New Orleans and watching
a morbid bluebottle fly that attempts to commit suicide by butting his
head against the windowpane Listenno yesit isit is the robins
singing in the gardenthe grateful joyous robins singing away like mad
just as if it wasnt Sunday Their audacity tickles me

My grandfather looks up and inquires in a sepulchral voice if I am
ready for Sabbath school It is time to go I like the Sabbath school
there are bright young faces there at all events When I get out into
the sunshine alone I draw a long breath I would turn a somersault up
against Neighbor Penhallows newly painted fence if I hadnt my best
trousers on so glad am I to escape from the oppressive atmosphere of
the Nutter House

Sabbath school over I go to meeting joining my grandfather who
doesnt appear to be any relation to me this day and Miss Abigail in
the porch Our minister holds out very little hope to any of us of being
saved Convinced that I am a lost creature in common with the human
family I return home behind my guardians at a snails pace We have a
dead cold dinner I saw it laid out yesterday

There is a long interval between this repast and the second service
and a still longer interval between the beginning and the end of that
service for the Rev Wibird Hawkinss sermons are none of the shortest
whatever else they may be

After meeting my grandfather and I take a walk We visit appropriately
enougha neighboring graveyard I am by this time in a condition of
mind to become a willing inmate of the place The usual evening
prayermeeting is postponed for some reason At half past eight I go to
bed

This is the way Sunday was observed in the Nutter House and pretty
generally throughout the town twenty years ago1 People who were
prosperous and natural and happy on Saturday became the most rueful of
human beings in the brief space of twelve hours I dont think there was
any hypocrisy in this It was merely the old Puritan austerity cropping
out once a week Many of these people were pure Christians every day in
the sevenexcepting the seventh Then they were decorous and solemn to
the verge of moroseness I should not like to be misunderstood on this
point Sunday is a blessed day and therefore it should not be made a
gloomy one It is the Lords day and I do believe that cheerful hearts
and faces are not unpleasant in His sight

 O day of rest How beautiful how fair
 How welcome to the weary and the old
 Day of the Lord and truce to earthly cares
 Day of the Lord as all our days should be
 Ah why will man by his austerities
 Shut out the blessed sunshine and the light
 And make of thee a dungeon of despair

Chapter SevenOne Memorable Night


Two months had elapsed since my arrival at Rivermouth when the approach
of an important celebration produced the greatest excitement among the
juvenile population of the town

There was very little hard study done in the Temple Grammar School the
week preceding the Fourth of July For my part my heart and brain were
so full of firecrackers Roman candles rockets pinwheels squibs
and gunpowder in various seductive forms that I wonder I didnt explode
under Mr Grimshaws very nose I couldnt do a sum to save me I
couldnt tell for love or money whether Tallahassee was the capital
of Tennessee or of Florida the present and the pluperfect tenses
were inextricably mixed in my memory and I didnt know a verb from an
adjective when I met one This was not alone my condition but that of
every boy in the school

Mr Grimshaw considerately made allowances for our temporary
distraction and sought to fix our interest on the lessons by connecting
them directly or indirectly with the coming Event The class in
arithmetic for instance was requested to state how many boxes of
firecrackers each box measuring sixteen inches square could be stored
in a room of such and such dimensions He gave us the Declaration of
Independence for a parsing exercise and in geography confined his
questions almost exclusively to localities rendered famous in the
Revolutionary War

What did the people of Boston do with the tea on board the English
vessels asked our wily instructor

Threw it into the river shrieked the smaller boys with an
impetuosity that made Mr Grimshaw smile in spite of himself One
luckless urchin said Chucked it for which happy expression he was
kept in at recess

Notwithstanding these clever stratagems there was not much solid work
done by anybody The trail of the serpent an inexpensive but dangerous
firetoy was over us all We went round deformed by quantities of
Chinese crackers artlessly concealed in our trouserspockets and if a
boy whipped out his handkerchief without proper precaution he was sure
to let off two or three torpedoes

Even Mr Grimshaw was made a sort of accessory to the universal
demoralization In calling the school to order he always rapped on
the table with a heavy ruler Under the green baize tablecloth on the
exact spot where he usually struck certain boy whose name I withhold
placed a fat torpedo The result was a loud explosion which caused Mr
Grimshaw to look queer Charley Marden was at the waterpail at the
time and directed general attention to himself by strangling for
several seconds and then squirting a slender thread of water over the
blackboard

Mr Grimshaw fixed his eyes reproachfully on Charley but said nothing
The real culprit it wasnt Charley Marden but the boy whose name I
withhold instantly regretted his badness and after school confessed
the whole thing to Mr Grimshaw who heaped coals of fire upon the
nameless boys head giving him five cents for the Fourth of July If
Mr Grimshaw had caned this unknown youth the punishment would not have
been half so severe

On the last day of June the Captain received a letter from my father
enclosing five dollars for my son Tom which enabled that young
gentleman to make regal preparations for the celebration of our national
independence A portion of this money two dollars I hastened to invest
in fireworks the balance I put by for contingencies In placing the
fund in my possession the Captain imposed one condition that dampened
my ardor considerablyI was to buy no gunpowder I might have all the
snappingcrackers and torpedoes I wanted but gunpowder was out of the
question

I thought this rather hard for all my young friends were provided with
pistols of various sizes Pepper Whitcomb had a horsepistol nearly as
large as himself and Jack Harris though he to be sure was a big
boy was going to have a real oldfashioned flintlock musket However I
didnt mean to let this drawback destroy my happiness I had one charge
of powder stowed away in the little brass pistol which I brought from
New Orleans and was bound to make a noise in the world once if I never
did again

It was a custom observed from time immemorial for the townsboys to have
a bonfire on the Square on the midnight before the Fourth I didnt ask
the Captains leave to attend this ceremony for I had a general idea
that he wouldnt give it If the Captain I reasoned doesnt forbid me
I break no orders by going Now this was a specious line of argument
and the mishaps that befell me in consequence of adopting it were richly
deserved

On the evening of the 3d I retired to bed very early in order to disarm
suspicion I didnt sleep a wink waiting for eleven oclock to come
round and I thought it never would come round as I lay counting from
time to time the slow strokes of the ponderous bell in the steeple of
the Old North Church At length the laggard hour arrived While the
clock was striking I jumped out of bed and began dressing

My grandfather and Miss Abigail were heavy sleepers and I might have
stolen downstairs and out at the front door undetected but such a
commonplace proceeding did not suit my adventurous disposition I
fastened one end of a rope it was a few yards cut from Kitty Collinss
clothesline to the bedpost nearest the window and cautiously climbed
out on the wide pediment over the hall door I had neglected to knot the
rope the result was that the moment I swung clear of the pediment I
descended like a flash of lightning and warmed both my hands smartly
The rope moreover was four or five feet too short so I got a fall
that would have proved serious had I not tumbled into the middle of one
of the big rosebushes growing on either side of the steps

I scrambled out of that without delay and was congratulating myself on
my good luck when I saw by the light of the setting moon the form of a
man leaning over the garden gate It was one of the town watch who had
probably been observing my operations with curiosity Seeing no chance
of escape I put a bold face on the matter and walked directly up to
him

What on airth air you a doin asked the man grasping the collar of
my jacket

I live here sir if you please I replied and am going to the
bonfire I didnt want to wake up the old folks thats all

The man cocked his eye at me in the most amiable manner and released
his hold

Boys is boys he muttered He didnt attempt to stop me as I slipped
through the gate

Once beyond his clutches I took to my heels and soon reached the
Square where I found forty or fifty fellows assembled engaged in
building a pyramid of tarbarrels The palms of my hands still tingled
so that I couldnt join in the sport I stood in the doorway of the
Nautilus Bank watching the workers among whom I recognized lots of my
schoolmates They looked like a legion of imps coming and going in the
twilight busy in raising some infernal edifice What a Babel of
voices it was everybody directing everybody else and everybody doing
everything wrong

When all was prepared someone applied a match to the sombre pile A
fiery tongue thrust itself out here and there then suddenly the whole
fabric burst into flames blazing and crackling beautifully This was a
signal for the boys to join hands and dance around the burning barrels
which they did shouting like mad creatures When the fire had burnt
down a little fresh staves were brought and heaped on the pyre In the
excitement of the moment I forgot my tingling palms and found myself in
the thick of the carousal

Before we were half ready our combustible material was expended and a
disheartening kind of darkness settled down upon us The boys collected
together here and there in knots consulting as to what should be done
It yet lacked four or five hours of daybreak and none of us were in the
humor to return to bed I approached one of the groups standing near the
town pump and discovered in the uncertain light of the dying brands the
figures of Jack Harris Phil Adams Harry Blake and Pepper Whitcomb
their faces streaked with perspiration and tar and their whole
appearance suggestive of New Zealand chiefs

Hullo Heres Tom Bailey shouted Pepper Whitcomb Hell join in

Of course he would The sting had gone out of my hands and I was ripe
for anythingnone the less ripe for not knowing what was on the tapis
After whispering together for a moment the boys motioned me to follow
them

We glided out from the crowd and silently wended our way through a
neighboring alley at the head of which stood a tumbledown old barn
owned by one Ezra Wingate In former days this was the stable of the
mailcoach that ran between Rivermouth and Boston When the railroad
superseded that primitive mode of travel the lumbering vehicle was
rolled in the barn and there it stayed The stagedriver after
prophesying the immediate downfall of the nation died of grief and
apoplexy and the old coach followed in his wake as fast as could
by quietly dropping to pieces The barn had the reputation of being
haunted and I think we all kept very close together when we found
ourselves standing in the black shadow cast by the tall gable Here
in a low voice Jack Harris laid bare his plan which was to burn the
ancient stagecoach

The old trundlecart isnt worth twentyfive cents said Jack Harris
and Ezra Wingate ought to thank us for getting the rubbish out of the
way But if any fellow here doesnt want to have a hand in it let him
cut and run and keep a quiet tongue in his head ever after

With this he pulled out the staples that held the lock and the big barn
door swung slowly open The interior of the stable was pitchdark of
course As we made a movement to enter a sudden scrambling and the
sound of heavy bodies leaping in all directions caused us to start back
in terror

Rats cried Phil Adams

Bats exclaimed Harry Blake

Cats suggested Jack Harris Whos afraid

Well the truth is we were all afraid and if the pole of the stage had
not been lying close to the threshold I dont believe anything on earth
would have induced us to cross it We seized hold of the polestraps
and succeeded with great trouble in dragging the coach out The two fore
wheels had rusted to the axletree and refused to revolve It was the
merest skeleton of a coach The cushions had long since been removed
and the leather hangings where they had not crumbled away dangled in
shreds from the wormeaten frame A load of ghosts and a span of phantom
horses to drag them would have made the ghastly thing complete

Luckily for our undertaking the stable stood at the top of a very steep
hill With three boys to push behind and two in front to steer we
started the old coach on its last trip with little or no difficulty
Our speed increased every moment and the fore wheels becoming unlocked
as we arrived at the foot of the declivity we charged upon the crowd
like a regiment of cavalry scattering the people right and left Before
reaching the bonfire to which someone had added several bushels of
shavings Jack Harris and Phil Adams who were steering dropped on the
ground and allowed the vehicle to pass over them which it did without
injuring them but the boys who were clinging for dear life to the
trunkrack behind fell over the prostrate steersman and there we all
lay in a heap two or three of us quite picturesque with the nosebleed

The coach with an intuitive perception of what was expected of it
plunged into the centre of the kindling shavings and stopped The
flames sprung up and clung to the rotten woodwork which burned like
tinder At this moment a figure was seen leaping wildly from the inside
of the blazing coach The figure made three bounds towards us and
tripped over Harry Blake It was Pepper Whitcomb with his hair somewhat
singed and his eyebrows completely scorched off

Pepper had slyly ensconced himself on the back seat before we started
intending to have a neat little ride down hill and a laugh at us
afterwards But the laugh as it happened was on our side or would
have been if half a dozen watchmen had not suddenly pounced down upon
us as we lay scrambling on the ground weak with mirth over Peppers
misfortune We were collared and marched off before we well knew what
had happened

The abrupt transition from the noise and light of the Square to the
silent gloomy brick room in the rear of the Meat Market seemed like the
work of enchantment We stared at each other aghast

Well remarked Jack Harris with a sickly smile this is a go

No go I should say whimpered Harry Blake glancing at the bare brick
walls and the heavy ironplated door

Never say die muttered Phil Adams dolefully

The bridewell was a small lowstudded chamber built up against the
rear end of the Meat Market and approached from the Square by a narrow
passageway A portion of the rooms partitioned off into eight cells
numbered each capable of holding two persons The cells were full at
the time as we presently discovered by seeing several hideous faces
leering out at us through the gratings of the doors

A smoky oillamp in a lantern suspended from the ceiling threw a
flickering light over the apartment which contained no furniture
excepting a couple of stout wooden benches It was a dismal place by
night and only little less dismal by day tall houses surrounding the
lockup prevented the faintest ray of sunshine from penetrating the
ventilator over the doorlong narrow window opening inward and propped
up by a piece of lath

As we seated ourselves in a row on one of the benches I imagine that
our aspect was anything but cheerful Adams and Harris looked very
anxious and Harry Blake whose nose had just stopped bleeding was
mournfully carving his name by sheer force of habit on the prison
bench I dont think I ever saw a more wrecked expression on any
human countenance than Pepper Whitcombs presented His look of natural
astonishment at finding himself incarcerated in a jail was considerably
heightened by his lack of eyebrows

As for me it was only by thinking how the late Baron Trenck would
have conducted himself under similar circumstances that I was able to
restrain my tears

None of us were inclined to conversation A deep silence broken now
and then by a startling snore from the cells reigned throughout the
chamber By and by Pepper Whitcomb glanced nervously towards Phil Adams
and said Phil do you think they willhang us

Hang your grandmother returned Adams impatiently What Im afraid
of is that theyll keep us locked up until the Fourth is over

You aint smart ef they do cried a voice from one of the cells It
was a deep bass voice that sent a chill through me

Who are you said Jack Harris addressing the cells in general for
the echoing qualities of the room made it difficult to locate the voice

That dont matter replied the speaker putting his face close up to
the gratings of No 3 but ef I was a youngster like you free an easy
outside there this spot wouldnt hold me long

Thats so chimed several of the prisonbirds wagging their heads
behind the iron lattices

Hush whispered Jack Harris rising from his seat and walking on
tiptoe to the door of cell No 3 What would you do

Do Why Id pile them ere benches up agin that ere door an crawl
out of that erc winder in no time Thats my adwice

And werry good adwice it is Jim said the occupant of No 5
approvingly

Jack Harris seemed to be of the same opinion for he hastily placed the
benches one on the top of another under the ventilator and climbing up
on the highest bench peeped out into the passageway

If any gent happens to have a ninepence about him said the man in
cell No 3 theres a sufferin family here as could make use of it
Smallest favors gratefully received an no questions axed

This appeal touched a new silver quarter of a dollar in my
trouserspocket I fished out the coin from a mass of fireworks and
gave it to the prisoner He appeared to be so goodnatured a fellow that
I ventured to ask what he had done to get into jail

Intirely innocent I was clapped in here by a rascally nevew as wishes
to enjoy my wealth afore Im dead

Your name Sir I inquired with a view of reporting the outrage to my
grandfather and having the injured person re instated in society

Git out you insolent young reptyle shouted the man in a passion

I retreated precipitately amid a roar of laughter from the other cells

Cant you keep still exclaimed Harris withdrawing his head from the
window

A portly watchman usually sat on a stool outside the door day and night
but on this particular occasion his services being required elsewhere
the bridewell had been left to guard itself

All clear whispered Jack Harris as he vanished through the
aperture and dropped softly on the ground outside We all followed him
expeditiouslyPepper Whitcomb and myself getting stuck in the window for
a moment in our frantic efforts not to be last

Now boys everybody for himself




Chapter EightThe Adventures of a Fourth


The sun cast a broad column of quivering gold across the river at the
foot of our street just as I reached the doorstep of the Nutter House
Kitty Collins with her dress tucked about her so that she looked as if
she had on a pair of calico trousers was washing off the sidewalk

Arrah you bad boy cried Kitty leaning on the mop handle The Capen
has jist been askin for you Hes gone up town now Its a nate thing
you done with my clothesline and its me you may thank for gettin it
out of the way before the Capen come down

The kind creature had hauled in the rope and my escapade had not been
discovered by the family but I knew very well that the burning of the
stagecoach and the arrest of the boys concerned in the mischief were
sure to reach my grandfathers ears sooner or later

Well Thomas said the old gentleman an hour or so afterwards
beaming upon me benevolently across the breakfast table you didnt
wait to be called this morning

No sir I replied growing very warm I took a little run up town to
see what was going on

I didnt say anything about the little run I took home again They had
quite a time on the Square last night remarked Captain Nutter looking
up from the Rivermouth Barnacle which was always placed beside his
coffeecup at breakfast

I felt that my hair was preparing to stand on end

Quite a time continued my grandfather Some boys broke into Ezra
Wingates barn and carried off the old stagecoach The young rascals I
do believe theyd burn up the whole town if they had their way

With this he resumed the paper After a long silence he exclaimed
Hullo upon which I nearly fell off the chair

Miscreants unknown read my grandfather following the paragraph
with his forefinger escaped from the bridewell leaving no clew to
their identity except the letter H cut on one of the benches Five
dollars reward offered for the apprehension of the perpetrators Sho I
hope Wingate will catch them

I dont see how I continued to live for on hearing this the breath went
entirely out of my body I beat a retreat from the room as soon as I
could and flew to the stable with a misty intention of mounting Gypsy
and escaping from the place I was pondering what steps to take when
Jack Harris and Charley Marden entered the yard

I say said Harris as blithe as a lark has old Wingate been here

Been here I cried I should hope not

The whole things out you know said Harris pulling Gypsys forelock
over her eyes and blowing playfully into her nostrils

You dont mean it I gasped

Yes I do and we are to pay Wingate three dollars apiece Hell make
rather a good spec out of it

But how did he discover that we were thethe miscreants I asked
quoting mechanically from the Rivermouth Bamacle

Why he saw us take the old ark confound him Hes been trying to sell
it any time these ten years Now he has sold it to us When he found
that we had slipped out of the Meat Market he went right off and wrote
the advertisement offering five dollars reward though he knew well
enough who had taken the coach for he came round to my fathers
house before the paper was printed to talk the matter over Wasnt the
governor mad though But its all settled I tell you Were to pay
Wingate fifteen dollars for the old gocart which he wanted to sell
the other day for seventyfive cents and couldnt Its a downright
swindle But the funny part of it is to come

O theres a funny part to it is there I remarked bitterly

Yes The moment Bill Conway saw the advertisement he knew it was
Harry Blake who cut that letter H on the bench so off he rushes up to
Wingatekind of him wasnt itand claims the reward Too late young
man says old Wingate the culprits has been discovered You see
Slyboots hadnt any intention of paying that five dollars

Jack Harriss statement lifted a weight from my bosom The article in
the Rivermouth Barnacle had placed the affair before me in a new light
I had thoughtlessly committed a grave offence Though the property in
question was valueless we were clearly wrong in destroying it At the
same time Mr Wingate had tacitly sanctioned the act by not preventing
it when he might easily have done so He had allowed his property to be
destroyed in order that he might realize a large profit

Without waiting to hear more I went straight to Captain Nutter and
laying my remaining three dollars on his knee confessed my share in the
previous nights transaction

The Captain heard me through in profound silence pocketed the
banknotes and walked off without speaking a word He had punished me
in his own whimsical fashion at the breakfast table for at the very
moment he was harrowing up my soul by reading the extracts from the
Rivermouth Barnacle he not only knew all about the bonfire but had
paid Ezra Wingate his three dollars Such was the duplicity of that aged
impostor

I think Captain Nutter was justified in retaining my pocketmoney as
additional punishment though the possession of it later in the day
would have got me out of a difficult position as the reader will see
further on I returned with a light heart and a large piece of punk to
my friends in the stableyard where we celebrated the termination
of our trouble by setting off two packs of firecrackers in an empty
winecask They made a prodigious racket but failed somehow to fully
express my feelings The little brass pistol in my bedroom suddenly
occurred to me It had been loaded I dont know how many months long
before I left New Orleans and now was the time if ever to fire it
off Muskets blunderbusses and pistols were banging away lively all
over town and the smell of gunpowder floating on the air set me wild
to add something respectable to the universal din

When the pistol was produced Jack Harris examined the rusty cap and
prophesied that it would not explode

Never mind said I lets try it

I had fired the pistol once secretly in New Orleans and remembering
the noise it gave birth to on that occasion I shut both eyes tight as
I pulled the trigger The hammer clicked on the cap with a dull dead
sound Then Harris tried it then Charley Marden then I took it again
and after three or four trials was on the point of giving it up as a
bad job when the obstinate thing went off with a tremendous explosion
nearly jerking my arm from the socket The smoke cleared away and
there I stood with the stock of the pistol clutched convulsively in my
handthe barrel lock trigger and ramrod having vanished into thin
air

Are you hurt cried the boys in one breath

Nno I replied dubiously for the concussion had bewildered me a
little

When I realized the nature of the calamity my grief was excessive I
cant imagine what led me to do so ridiculous a thing but I gravely
buried the remains of my beloved pistol in our back garden and erected
over the mound a slate tablet to the effect that Mr Barker formerly of
new Orleans was killed accidentally on the Fourth of July 18 in the
2nd year of his Age Binny Wallace arriving on the spot just after
the disaster and Charley Marden who enjoyed the obsequies immensely
acted with me as chief mourners I for my part was a very sincere one

As I turned away in a disconsolate mood from the garden Charley Marden
remarked that he shouldnt be surprised if the pistolbutt took root and
grew into a mahoganytree or something He said he once planted an old
musketstock and shortly afterwards a lot of shoots sprung up Jack
Harris laughed but neither I nor Binny Wallace saw Charleys wicked
joke

We were now joined by Pepper Whitcomb Fred Langdon and several other
desperate characters on their way to the Square which was always a
busy place when public festivities were going on Feeling that I was
still in disgrace with the Captain I thought it politic to ask his
consent before accompanying the boys

He gave it with some hesitation advising me to be careful not to get
in front of the firearms Once he put his fingers mechanically into his
vestpocket and half drew forth some dollar bills then slowly thrust
them back again as his sense of justice overcame his genial disposition
I guess it cut the old gentleman to the heart to be obliged to keep
me out of my pocketmoney I know it did me However as I was passing
through the hall Miss Abigail with a very severe cast of countenance
slipped a brandnew quarter into my hand We had silver currency in
those days thank Heaven

Great were the bustle and confusion on the Square By the way I dont
know why they called this large open space a square unless because it
was an ovalan oval formed by the confluence of half a dozen streets
now thronged by crowds of smartly dressed townspeople and country
folks for Rivermouth on the Fourth was the centre of attraction to the
inhabitants of the neighboring villages

On one side of the Square were twenty or thirty booths arranged in
a semicircle gay with little flags and seductive with lemonade
gingerbeer and seedcakes Here and there were tables at which could be
purchased the smaller sort of fireworks such as pinwheels serpents
doubleheaders and punk warranted not to go out Many of the adjacent
houses made a pretty display of bunting and across each of the streets
opening on the Square was an arch of spruce and evergreen blossoming
all over with patriotic mottoes and paper roses

It was a noisy merry bewildering scene as we came upon the ground The
incessant rattle of small arms the booming of the twelvepounder firing
on the Mill Dam and the silvery clangor of the churchbells ringing
simultaneouslynot to mention an ambitious brassband that was blowing
itself to pieces on a balconywere enough to drive one distracted We
amused ourselves for an hour or two darting in and out among the crowd
and setting off our crackers At one oclock the Hon Hezekiah Elkins
mounted a platform in the middle of the Square and delivered an oration
to which his fellercitizens didnt pay much attention having all
they could do to dodge the squibs that were set loose upon them by
mischievous boys stationed on the surrounding housetops

Our little party which had picked up recruits here and there not being
swayed by eloquence withdrew to a booth on the outskirts of the crowd
where we regaled ourselves with root beer at two cents a glass I
recollect being much struck by the placard surmounting this tent

ROOT BEER

SOLD HERE

It seemed to me the perfection of pith and poetry What could be more
terse Not a word to spare and yet everything fully expressed Rhyme
and rhythm faultless It was a delightful poet who made those verses As
for the beer itselfthat I think must have been made from the root
of all evil A single glass of it insured an uninterrupted pain for
twentyfour hours

The influence of my liberality working on Charley Mardenfor it was I
who paid for the beerhe presently invited us all to take an icecream
with him at Pettingils saloon Pettingil was the Delmonico of
Rivermouth He furnished ices and confectionery for aristocratic balls
and parties and didnt disdain to officiate as leader of the orchestra
at the same for Pettingil played on the violin as Pepper Whitcomb
described it like Old Scratch

Pettingils confectionery store was on the corner of Willow and High
Streets The saloon separated from the shop by a flight of three steps
leading to a door hung with faded red drapery had about it an air of
mystery and seclusion quite delightful Four windows also draped faced
the sidestreet affording an unobstructed view of Marm Hatchs back
yard where a number of inexplicable garments on a clothesline were
always to be seen careering in the wind

There was a lull just then in the icecream business it being
dinnertime and we found the saloon unoccupied When we had seated
ourselves around the largest marbletopped table Charley Marden in a
manly voice ordered twelve sixpenny icecreams strawberry and verneller
mixed

It was a magnificent sight those twelve chilly glasses entering the
room on a waiter the red and white custard rising from each glass like
a churchsteeple and the spoonhandle shooting up from the apex like
a spire I doubt if a person of the nicest palate could have
distinguished with his eyes shut which was the vanilla and which the
strawberry but if I could at this moment obtain a cream tasting as that
did I would give five dollars for a very small quantity

We fell to with a will and so evenly balanced were our capabilities
that we finished our creams together the spoons clinking in the glasses
like one spoon

Lets have some more cried Charley Marden with the air of Aladdin
ordering up a fresh hogshead of pearls and rubies Tom Bailey tell
Pettingil to send in another round

Could I credit my ears I looked at him to see if he were in earnest
He meant it In a moment more I was leaning over the counter giving
directions for a second supply Thinking it would make no difference to
such a gorgeous young sybarite as Marden I took the liberty of ordering
ninepenny creams this time

On returning to the saloon what was my horror at finding it empty

There were the twelve cloudy glasses standing in a circle on the sticky
marble slab and not a boy to be seen A pair of hands letting go their
hold on the windowsill outside explained matters I had been made a
victim

I couldnt stay and face Pettingil whose peppery temper was well known
among the boys I hadnt a cent in the world to appease him What should
I do I heard the clink of approaching glassesthe ninepenny creams
I rushed to the nearest window It was only five feet to the ground I
threw myself out as if I had been an old hat

Landing on my feet I fled breathlessly down High Street through
Willow and was turning into Brierwood Place when the sound of several
voices calling to me in distress stopped my progress

Look out you fool The mine The mine yelled the warning voices

Several men and boys were standing at the head of the street making
insane gestures to me to avoid something But I saw no mine only in the
middle of the road in front of me was a common flourbarrel which as
I gazed at it suddenly rose into the air with a terrific explosion
I felt myself thrown violently off my feet I remember nothing else
excepting that as I went up I caught a momentary glimpse of Ezra
Wingate leering through is shop window like an avenging spirit

The mine that had wrought me woe was not properly a mine at all but
merely a few ounces of powder placed under an empty keg or barrel and
fired with a slowmatch Boys who didnt happen to have pistols or
cannon generally burnt their powder in this fashion

For an account of what followed I am indebted to hearsay for I was
insensible when the people picked me up and carried me home on a shutter
borrowed from the proprietor of Pettingils saloon I was supposed to
be killed but happily happily for me at least I was merely stunned
I lay in a semiunconscious state until eight oclock that night when
I attempted to speak Miss Abigail who watched by the bedside put
her ear down to my lips and was saluted with these remarkable words
Strawberry and verneller mixed

Mercy on us What is the boy saying cried Miss Abigail

Chapter NineI Become an R M C


In the course of ten days I recovered sufficiently from my injuries to
attend school where for a little while I was looked upon as a hero
on account of having been blown up What dont we make a hero of The
distraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the Fourth
had subsided and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities
excepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of Pepper Whitcomb
and myself

In August we had two weeks vacation It was about this time that I
became a member of the Rivermouth Centipedes a secret society composed
of twelve of the Temple Grammar School boys This was an honor to which
I had long aspired but being a new boy I was not admitted to the
fraternity until my character had fully developed itself

It was a very select society the object of which I never fathomed
though I was an active member of the body during the remainder of my
residence at Rivermouth and at one time held the onerous position of F
C First Centipede Each of the elect wore a copper cent some occult
association being established between a cent apiece and a centipedes
suspended by a string round his neck The medals were worn next the
skin and it was while bathing one day at Grave Point with Jack Harris
and Fred Langdon that I had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch
by a sight of these singular emblems As soon as I ascertained the
existence of a boys club of course I was ready to die to join it And
eventually I was allowed to join

The initiation ceremony took place in Fred Langdons barn where I was
submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a
timorous boy Before being led to the Grotto of Enchantmentsuch was the
modest title given to the loft over my friends woodhousemy hands were
securely pinioned and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief
At the head of the stairs I was told in an unrecognizable husky voice
that it was not yet too late to retreat if I felt myself physically too
weak to undergo the necessary tortures I replied that I was not too
weak in a tone which I intended to be resolute but which in spite of
me seemed to come from the pit of my stomach

It is well said the husky voice

I did not feel so sure about that but having made up my mind to be a
Centipede a Centipede I was bound to be Other boys had passed through
the ordeal and lived why should not I

A prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination and I was
wondering what would come next when a pistol fired off close by my car
deafened me for a moment The unknown voice then directed me to take ten
steps forward and stop at the word halt I took ten steps and halted

Stricken mortal said a second husky voice more husky if possible
than the first if you had advanced another inch you would have
disappeared down an abyss three thousand feet deep

I naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information A prick
from some twopronged instrument evidently a pitchfork gently
checked my retreat I was then conducted to the brink of several other
precipices and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms where
the result would have been instant death if I had committed the least
mistake I have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by
dismal groans from different parts of the grotto

Finally I was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an
incalculable height Here I stood breathless while the bylaws were read
aloud A more extraordinary code of laws never came from the brain of
man The penalties attached to the abject being who should reveal any
of the secrets of the society were enough to make the blood run cold A
second pistolshot was heard the something I stood on sunk with a crash
beneath my feet and I fell two miles as nearly as I could compute it
At the same instant the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes and I
found myself standing in an empty hogshead surrounded by twelve masked
figures fantastically dressed One of the conspirators was really
appalling with a tin saucepan on his head and a tigerskin sleighrobe
thrown over his shoulders I scarcely need say that there were no
vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which I had passed so
cautiously My ascent had been to the top of the hogshead and my
descent to the bottom thereof Holding one another by the hand
and chanting a low dirge the Mystic Twelve revolved about me This
concluded the ceremony With a merry shout the boys threw off their
masks and I was declared a regularly installed member of the R M C

I afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club for these
initiations as you may imagine were sometimes very comical spectacles
especially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a
timid disposition If he showed the slightest terror he was certain
to be tricked unmercifully One of our subsequent devicesa humble
invention of my ownwas to request the blindfolded candidate to put out
his tongue whereupon the First Centipede would say in a low tone
as if not intended for the ear of the victim Diabolus fetch me the
redhot iron The expedition with which that tongue would disappear was
simply ridiculous

Our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods but as
circumstances suggested Any member had a right to call a meeting Each
boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent Whenever a member
had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend
he called a meeting For instance immediately on learning the death of
Harry Blakes greatgrandfather I issued a call By these simple and
ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition
sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter

I have said that the society had no special object It is true there
was a tacit understanding among us that the Centipedes were to stand by
one another on all occasions though I dont remember that they did but
further than this we had no purpose unless it was to accomplish as
a body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as
individuals To mystify the staid and slowgoing Rivermouthians was our
frequent pleasure Several of our pranks won us such a reputation among
the townsfolk that we were credited with having a large finger in
whatever went amiss in the place

One morning about a week after my admission into the secret order the
quiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal
streets had changed places during the night People who went trustfully
to sleep in Currant Square opened their eyes in Honeysuckle Terrace
Joness Avenue at the north end had suddenly become Walnut Street
and Peanut Street was nowhere to be found Confusion reigned The town
authorities took the matter in hand without delay and six of the Temple
Grammar School boys were summoned to appear before justice Clapbam

Having tearfully disclaimed to my grandfather all knowledge of
the transaction I disappeared from the family circle and was not
apprehended until late in the afternoon when the Captain dragged me
ignominiously from the haymow and conducted me more dead than alive
to the office of justice Clapham Here I encountered five other pallid
culprits who had been fished out of divers coalbins garrets and
chickencoops to answer the demands of the outraged laws Charley
Marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his fathers house
and looked like a recently exhumed mummy

There was not the least evidence against us and indeed we were wholly
innocent of the offence The trick as was afterwards proved had been
played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor We
were indebted for our arrest to Master Conway who had slyly dropped a
hint within the hearing of Selectman Mudge to the effect that young
Bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs
When he was called upon to make good his assertion he was considerably
more terrified than the Centipedes though they were ready to sink into
their shoes

At our next meeting it was unanimously resolved that Conways animosity
should not be quietly submitted to He had sought to inform against
us in the stagecoach business he had volunteered to carry Pettingils
little bill for twentyfour icecreams to Charley Mardens father and
now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice Clapham on a charge
equally groundless and painful After much noisy discussion a plan of
retaliation was agreed upon

There was a certain slim mild apothecary in the town by the name of
Meeks It was generally given out that Mr Meeks had a vague desire
to get married but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral
courage to do so It was also well known that the Widow Conway had not
buried her heart with the late lamented As to her shyness that was not
so clear Indeed her attentions to Mr Meeks whose mother she might
have been were of a nature not to be misunderstood and were not
misunderstood by anyone but Mr Meeks himself

The widow carried on a dressmaking establishment at her residence on
the corner opposite Meekss drugstore and kept a wary eye on all the
young ladies from Miss Dorothy Gibbss Female Institute who patronized
the shop for sodawater aciddrops and slatepencils In the afternoon
the widow was usually seen seated smartly dressed at her window
upstairs casting destructive glances across the streetthe artificial
roses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a
label on a prescription To be Taken Immediately But Mr Meeks didnt
take

The ladys fondness and the gentlemans blindness were topics ably
handled at every sewingcircle in the town It was through these two
luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common
enemy To kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit
our sanguinary purpose We disliked the widow not so much for her
sentimentality as for being the mother of Bill Conway we disliked Mr
Meeks not because he was insipid like his own syrups but because the
widow loved him Bill Conway we hated for himself

Late one dark Saturday night in September we carried our plan into
effect On the following morning as the orderly citizens wended their
way to church past the widows abode their sober faces relaxed at
beholding over her front door the well known gilt Mortar and Pestle
which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner
while the passers on that side of the street were equally amused and
scandalized at seeing a placard bearing the following announcement
tacked to the druggists windowshutters

Wanted a Sempstress

The naughty cleverness of the joke which I should be sorry to defend
was recognized at once It spread like wildfire over the town and
though the mortar and the placard were speedily removed our triumph
was complete The whole community was on the broad grin and our
participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected

It was those wicked soldiers at the fort




Chapter TenI Fight Conway


There was one person however who cherished a strong suspicion that the
Centipedes had had a hand in the business and that person was Conway
His red hair seemed to change to a livelier red and his sallow cheeks
to a deeper sallow as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our
slates the next day in school He knew we were watching him and made
sundry mouths and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums

Conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his ownthat of throwing his
thumbs out of joint at will Sometimes while absorbed in study or on
becoming nervous at recitation he performed the feat unconsciously
Throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a
chronic state of dislocation indicating great mental agitation on the
part of the owner We fully expected an outbreak from him at recess but
the intermission passed off tranquilly somewhat to our disappointment

At the close of the afternoon session it happened that Binny Wallace
and myself having got swamped in our Latin exercise were detained in
school for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of Mr
Andrewss perplexing irregular verbs Binny Wallace finishing his task
first was dismissed I followed shortly after and on stepping into
the playground saw my little friend plastered as it were up against
the fence and Conway standing in front of him ready to deliver a blow
on the upturned unprotected face whose gentleness would have stayed
any arm but a cowards

Seth Rodgers with both hands in his pockets was leaning against the
pump lazily enjoying the sport but on seeing me sweep across the
yard whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling he called out
lustily Lay low Conway Heres young Bailey

Conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended
for his head He reached forward one of his long armshe had arms like
a windmill that boyand grasping me by the hair tore out quite a
respectable handful The tears flew to my eyes but they were not the
tears of defeat they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature
paid to the departed tresses

In a second my little jacket lay on the ground and I stood on guard
resting lightly on my right leg and keeping my eye fixed steadily on
Conwaysin all of which I was faithfully following the instructions of
Phil Adams whose father subscribed to a sporting journal

Conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude and there we were
glaring at each other motionless neither of us disposed to risk an
attack but both on the alert to resist one There is no telling how
long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been
interrupted

It was a custom with the larger pupils to return to the playground
after school and play baseball until sundown The town authorities
had prohibited ballplaying on the Square and there being no other
available place the boys fell back perforce on the schoolyard Just at
this crisis a dozen or so of the Templars entered the gate and seeing
at a glance the belligerent status of Conway and myself dropped bat and
ball and rushed to the spot where we stood

Is it a fight asked Phil Adams who saw by our freshness that we had
not yet got to work

Yes its a fight I answered unless Conway will ask Wallaces
pardon promise never to hector me in futureand put back my hair

This last condition was rather a staggerer

I shant do nothing of the sort said Conway sulkily

Then the thing must go on said Adams with dignity Rodgers as I
understand it is your second Conway Bailey come here Whats the row
about

He was thrashing Binny Wallace

No I wasnt interrupted Conway but I was going to because he knows
who put Meekss mortar over our door And I know well enough who did it
it was that sneaking little mulatter pointing at me

O by George I cried reddening at the insult

Cool is the word said Adams as he bound a handkerchief round my
head and carefully tucked away the long straggling locks that offered a
tempting advantage to the enemy Who ever heard of a fellow with such
a head of hair going into action muttered Phil twitching the
handkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied He then loosened my
gallowses braces and buckled them tightly above my hips Now then
bantam never say die

Conway regarded these businesslike preparations with evident misgiving
for he called Rodgers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar
manner though his hair was cropped so close that you couldnt have
taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers

Is your man ready asked Phil Adams addressing Rodgers

Ready

Keep your back to the gate Tom whispered Phil in my car and youll
have the sun in his eyes

Behold us once more face to face like David and the Philistine Look
at us as long as you may for this is all you shall see of the combat
According to my thinking the hospital teaches a better lesson than the
battlefield I will tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip if
you will but not a word of the fight

Youll get no description of it from me simply because I think it would
prove very poor reading and not because I consider my revolt against
Conways tyranny unjustifiable

I had borne Conways persecutions for many months with lamblike
patience I might have shielded myself by appealing to Mr Grimshaw but
no boy in the Temple Grammar School could do that without losing caste
Whether this was just or not doesnt matter a pin since it was soa
traditionary law of the place The personal inconvenience I suffered
from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly
by his persistent cruelty to little Binny Wallace I should have lacked
the spirit of a hen if I had not resented it finally I am glad that I
faced Conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever I am glad
that Phil Adams taught me to box and I say to all youngsters Learn to
box to ride to pull an oar and to swim The occasion may come round
when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments
will be of service to you

In one of the best books 1 ever written for boys are these words

Learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and football Not one
of you will be the worse but very much the better for learning to box
well Should you never have to use it in earnest theres no exercise in
the world so good for the temper and for the muscles of the back and
legs

As for fighting keep out of it if you can by all means When the
time comes if ever it should that you have to say Yes or No to a
challenge to fight say No if you canonly take care you make it plain
to yourself why you say No Its a proof of the highest courage if
done from true Christian motives Its quite right and justifiable if
done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger But dont say
No because you fear a licking and say or think its because you fear
God for thats neither Christian nor honest And if you do fight fight
it out and dont give in while you can stand and see

And dont give in when you cant see For I could stand very little
and see not at all having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty
seconds when Conway retired from the field As Phil Adams stepped up
to shake hands with me he received a telling blow in the stomach
for all the fight was not out of me yet and I mistook him for a new
adversary

Convinced of my error I accepted his congratulations with those of the
other boys blandly and blindly I remember that Binny Wallace wanted to
give me his silver pencilcase The gentle soul had stood throughout the
contest with his face turned to the fence suffering untold agony

A good wash at the pump and a cold key applied to my eye refreshed me
amazingly Escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows I walked home
through the pleasant autumn twilight battered but triumphant As I went
along my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye I
felt that I was not only following my nose but following it so closely
that I was in some danger of treading on it I seemed to have nose
enough for the whole party My left cheek also was puffed out like
a dumpling I couldnt help saying to myself If this is victory how
about that other fellow

Tom said Harry Blake hesitating

Well

Did you see Mr Grimshaw looking out of the recitationroom window just
as we left the yard

No was he though

I am sure of it

Then he must have seen all the row

Shouldnt wonder

No he didnt broke in Adams or he would have stopped it short
metre but I guess be saw you pitching into the pump which you did
uncommonly strongand of course be smelt mischief directly

Well it cant be helped now I reflected

As the monkey said when he fell out of the cocoanut tree added
Charley Marden trying to make me laugh

It was early candlelight when we reached the house Miss Abigail
opening the front door started back at my hilarious appearance I
tried to smile upon her sweetly but the smile rippling over my
swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose produced an
expression of which Miss Abigail declared she had never seen the like
excepting on the face of a Chinese idol

She hustled me unceremoniously into the presence of my grandfather in
the sittingroom Captain Nutter as the recognized professional warrior
of our family could not consistently take me to task for fighting
Conway nor was he disposed to do so for the Captain was well aware of
the longcontinued provocation I had endured

Ah you rascal cried the old gentleman after hearing my story Just
like me when I was youngalways in one kind of trouble or another I
believe it runs in the family

I think said Miss Abigail without the faintest expression on her
countenance that a tablespoonful of hotdro The Captain interrupted
Miss Abigail peremptorily directing her to make a shade out of
cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye Miss Abigail must have been
possessed with the idea that I had taken up pugilism as a profession
for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders

Theyll be handy to have in the house says Miss Abigail grimly

Of course so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by
Mr Grimshaw He had as we suspected witnessed the closing scene
of the fight from the schoolroom window and the next morning after
prayers I was not wholly unprepared when Master Conway and myself
were called up to the desk for examination Conway with a piece of
courtplaster in the shape of a Maltese cross on his right cheek and
I with the silk patch over my left eye caused a general titter through
the room

Silence said Mr Grimshaw sharply

As the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of
Bailey versus Conway I shall not report the trial further than to say
that Adams Marden and several other pupils testified to the fact that
Conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the Temple School
Their evidence also went to show that Conway was a quarrelsome character
generally Bad for Conway Seth Rodgers on the part of his friend
proved that I had struck the first blow That was bad for me

If you please sir said Binny Wallace holding up his hand for
permission to speak Bailey didnt fight on his own account he fought
on my account and if you please sir I am the boy to be blamed for I
was the cause of the trouble

This drew out the story of Conways harsh treatment of the smaller boys
As Binny related the wrongs of his playfellows saying very little
of his own grievances I noticed that Mr Grimshaws hand unknown to
himself perhaps rested lightly from time to time on Wallaces sunny
hair The examination finished Mr Grimshaw leaned on the desk
thoughtfully for a moment and then said

Every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to
fight If one boy maltreats another within schoolbounds or within
schoolhours that is a matter for me to settle The case should be laid
before me I disapprove of talebearing I never encourage it in
the slightest degree but when one pupil systematically persecutes a
schoolmate it is the duty of some headboy to inform me No pupil has a
right to take the law into his own hands If there is any fighting to be
done I am the person to be consulted I disapprove of boys fighting
it is unnecessary and unchristian In the present instance I consider
every large boy in this school at fault but as the offence is one of
omission rather than commission my punishment must rest only on the two
boys convicted of misdemeanor Conway loses his recess for a month
and Bailey has a page added to his Latin lessons for the next four
recitations I now request Bailey and Conway to shake hands in the
presence of the school and acknowledge their regret at what has
occurred

Conway and I approached each other slowly and cautiously as if we were
bent upon another hostile collision We clasped hands in the tamest
manner imaginable and Conway mumbled Im sorry I fought with you

I think you are I replied drily and Im sorry I had to thrash
you

You can go to your seats said Mr Grimshaw turning his face aside to
hide a smile I am sure my apology was a very good one

I never had any more trouble with Conway He and his shadow Seth
Rodgers gave me a wide berth for many months Nor was Binny Wallace
subjected to further molestation Miss Abigails sanitary stores
including a bottle of opodeldoc were never called into requisition The
six black silk patches with their elastic strings are still dangling
from a beam in the garret of the Nutter House waiting for me to get
into fresh difficulties

Chapter ElevenAll About Gypsy


This record of my life at Rivermouth would be strangely incomplete did I
not devote an entire chapter to Gypsy I had other pets of course for
what healthy boy could long exist without numerous friends in the animal
kingdom I had two white mice that were forever gnawing their way out
of a pasteboard chateau and crawling over my face when I lay asleep I
used to keep the pinkeyed little beggars in my bedroom greatly to the
annoyance of Miss Abigail who was constantly fancying that one of the
mice had secreted itself somewhere about her person

I also owned a dog a terrier who managed in some inscrutable way
to pick a quarrel with the moon and on bright nights kept up such a
kiyiing in our back garden that we were finally forced to dispose
of him at private sale He was purchased by Mr Oxford the butcher
I protested against the arrangement and ever afterwards when we had
sausages from Mr Oxfords shop I made believe I detected in them
certain evidences that Cato had been foully dealt with

Of birds I had no end robins purplemartins wrens bulfinches
bobolinks ringdoves and pigeons At one time I took solid comfort
in the iniquitous society of a dissipated old parrot who talked so
terribly that the Rev Wibird Hawkins happening to get a sample of
Polls vituperative powers pronounced him a benighted heathen and
advised the Captain to get rid of him A brace of turtles supplanted
the parrot in my affections the turtles gave way to rabbits and the
rabbits in turn yielded to the superior charms of a small monkey which
the Captain bought of a sailor lately from the coast of Africa

But Gypsy was the prime favorite in spite of many rivals I never grew
weary of her She was the most knowing little thing in the world Her
proper sphere in lifeand the one to which she ultimately attainedwas
the sawdust arena of a travelling circus There was nothing short of
the three Rs reading riting and rithmetic that Gypsy couldnt be
taught The gift of speech was not hers but the faculty of thought was

My little friend to be sure was not exempt from certain graceful
weaknesses inseparable perhaps from the female character She was
very pretty and she knew it She was also passionately fond of dressby
which I mean her best harness When she had this on her curvetings
and prancings were laughable though in ordinary tackle she went along
demurely enough There was something in the enamelled leather and the
silverwashed mountings that chimed with her artistic sense To have her
mane braided and a rose or a pansy stuck into her forelock was to make
her too conceited for anything

She had another trait not rare among her sex She liked the attentions
of young gentlemen while the society of girls bored her She would drag
them sulkily in the cart but as for permitting one of them in the
saddle the idea was preposterous Once when Pepper Whitcombs sister
in spite of our remonstrances ventured to mount her Gypsy gave a
little indignant neigh and tossed the gentle Emma heels over head in no
time But with any of the boys the mare was as docile as a lamb

Her treatment of the several members of the family was comical For the
Captain she entertained a wholesome respect and was always on her good
behavior when he was around As to Miss Abigail Gypsy simply laughed at
herliterally laughed contracting her upper lip and displaying all her
snowwhite teeth as if something about Miss Abigail struck her Gypsy
as being extremely ridiculous

Kitty Collins for some reason or another was afraid of the pony or
pretended to be The sagacious little animal knew it of course and
frequently when Kitty was banging out clothes near the stable the mare
being loose in the yard would make short plunges at her Once Gypsy
seized the basket of clothespins with her teeth and rising on her hind
legs pawing the air with her fore feet followed Kitty clear up to the
scullery steps

That part of the yard was shut off from the rest by a gate but no gate
was proof against Gypsys ingenuity She could let down bars lift up
latches draw bolts and turn all sorts of buttons This accomplishment
rendered it hazardous for Miss Abigail or Kitty to leave any eatables on
the kitchen table near the window On one occasion Gypsy put in her head
and lapped up six custard pies that had been placed by the casement to
cool

An account of my young ladys various pranks would fill a thick
volume A favorite trick of hers on being requested to walk like Miss
Abigail was to assume a little skittish gait so true to nature
that Miss Abigail herself was obliged to admit the cleverness of the
imitation

The idea of putting Gypsy through a systematic course of instruction
was suggested to me by a visit to the circus which gave an annual
performance in Rivermouth This show embraced among its attractions a
number of trained Shetland ponies and I determined that Gypsy should
likewise have the benefit of a liberal education I succeeded in
teaching her to waltz to fire a pistol by tugging at a string tied
to the trigger to lie down dead to wink one eye and to execute many
other feats of a difficult nature She took to her studies admirably
and enjoyed the whole thing as much as anyone

The monkey was a perpetual marvel to Gypsy They became bosomfriends
in an incredibly brief period and were never easy out of each others
sight Prince Zanythats what Pepper Whitcomb and I christened him one
day much to the disgust of the monkey who bit a piece out of Peppers
noseresided in the stable and went to roost every night on the ponys
back where I usually found him in the morning Whenever I rode out I
was obliged to secure his Highness the Prince with a stout cord to the
fence he chattering all the time like a madman

One afternoon as I was cantering through the crowded part of the town I
noticed that the people in the street stopped stared at me and fell to
laughing I turned round in the saddle and there was Zany with a great
burdock leaf in his paw perched up behind me on the crupper as solemn
as a judge

After a few months poor Zany sickened mysteriously and died The dark
thought occurred to me then and comes back to me now with redoubled
force that Miss Abigail must have given him some hotdrops Zany left
a large circle of sorrowing friends if not relatives Gypsy I think
never entirely recovered from the shock occasioned by his early
demise She became fonder of me though and one of her cunningest
demonstrations was to escape from the stableyard and trot up to the
door of the Temple Grammar School where I would discover her at recess
patiently waiting for me with her fore feet on the second step and
wisps of straw standing out all over her like quills upon the fretful
porcupine

I should fail if I tried to tell you how dear the pony was to me Even
hard unloving men become attached to the horses they take care of so
I who was neither unloving nor hard grew to love every glossy hair of
the pretty little creature that depended on me for her soft straw bed
and her daily modicum of oats In my prayer at night I never forgot to
mention Gypsy with the rest of the familygenerally setting forth her
claims first

Whatever relates to Gypsy belongs properly to this narrative therefore
I offer no apology for rescuing from oblivion and boldly printing here
a short composition which I wrote in the early part of my first quarter
at the Temple Grammar School It is my maiden effort in a difficult art
and is perhaps lacking in those graces of thought and style which are
reached only after the severest practice

Every Wednesday morning on entering school each pupil was expected
to lay his exercise on Mr Grimshaws desk the subject was usually
selected by Mr Grimshaw himself the Monday previous With a humor
characteristic of him our teacher had instituted two prizes one for
the best and the other for the worst composition of the month The first
prize consisted of a penknife or a pencilcase or some such article
dear to the heart of youth the second prize entitled the winner to wear
for an hour or two a sort of conical paper cap on the front of which
was written in tall letters this modest admission I AM A DUNCE The
competitor who took prize No 2 wasnt generally an object of envy

My pulse beat high with pride and expectation that Wednesday morning as
I laid my essay neatly folded on the masters table I firmly decline
to say which prize I won but heres the composition to speak for
itself

It is no smallauthor vanity that induces me to publish this stray
leaf of natural history I lay it before our young folks not for
their admiration but for their criticism Let each reader take
his leadpencil and remorselessly correct the orthography the
capitalization and the punctuation of the essay I shall not feel hurt
at seeing my treatise cut all to pieces though I think highly of the
production not on account of its literary excellence which I candidly
admit is not overpowering but because it was written years and years
ago about Gypsy by a little fellow who when I strive to recall him
appears to me like a reduced ghost of my present self

I am confident that any reader who has ever had pets birds or animals
will forgive me for this brief digression




Chapter TwelveWinter at Rivermouth


I guess were going to have a regular oldfashioned snowstorm
said Captain Nutter one bleak December morning casting a peculiarly
nautical glance skyward

The Captain was always hazarding prophecies about the weather which
somehow never turned out according to his prediction The vanes on the
churchsteeples seemed to take fiendish pleasure in humiliating the
dear old gentleman If he said it was going to be a clear day a dense
seafog was pretty certain to set in before noon Once he caused a
protracted drought by assuring us every morning for six consecutive
weeks that it would rain in a few hours But sure enough that
afternoon it began snowing

Now I had not seen a snowstorm since I was eighteen months old and of
course remembered nothing about it A boy familiar from his infancy with
the rigors of our New England winters can form no idea of the impression
made on me by this natural phenomenon My delight and surprise were as
boundless as if the heavy gray sky had let down a shower of pond
lilies and white roses instead of snowflakes It happened to be a
halfholiday so I had nothing to do but watch the feathery crystals
whirling hither and thither through the air I stood by the sittingroom
window gazing at the wonder until twilight shut out the novel scene

We had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before but this was
a regular noreaster

Several inches of snow had already fallen The rosebushes at the door
drooped with the weight of their magical blossoms and the two posts
that held the garden gate were transformed into stately Turks with
white turbans guarding the entrance to the Nutter House

The storm increased at sundown and continued with unabated violence
through the night The next morning when I jumped out of bed the sun
was shining brightly the cloudless heavens wore the tender azure of
June and the whole earth lay muffled up to the eyes as it were in a
thick mantle of milkwhite down

It was a very deep snow The Oldest Inhabitant what would become of a
New England town or village without its oldest Inhabitant overhauled
his almanacs and pronounced it the deepest snow we had had for twenty
years It couldnt have been much deeper without smothering us all
Our street was a sight to be seen or rather it was a sight not to
be seen for very little street was visible One huge drift completely
banked up our front door and half covered my bedroom window

There was no school that day for all the thoroughfares were impassable
By twelve oclock however the great snowploughs each drawn by four
yokes of oxen broke a wagonpath through the principal streets but the
footpassengers had a hard time of it floundering in the arctic drifts

The Captain and I cut a tunnel three feet wide and six feet high from
our front door to the sidewalk opposite It was a beautiful cavern with
its walls and roof inlaid with motherofpearl and diamonds I am sure
the ice palace of the Russian Empress in Cowpers poem was not a more
superb piece of architecture

The thermometer began falling shortly before sunset and we had the
bitterest cold night I ever experienced This brought out the Oldest
Inhabitant again the next dayand what a gay old boy he was for deciding
everything Our tunnel was turned into solid ice A crust thick enough
to bear men and horses had formed over the snow everywhere and the air
was alive with merry sleighbells Icy stalactites a yard long bung
from the eaves of the house and the Turkish sentinels at the gate
looked as if they had given up all hopes of ever being relieved from
duty

So the winter set in cold and glittering Everything outofdoors was
sheathed in silver mail To quote from Charley Marden it was cold
enough to freeze the tail off a brass monkeyan observation which
seemed to me extremely happy though I knew little or nothing concerning
the endurance of brass monkeys having never seen one

I had looked forward to the advent of the season with grave
apprehensions nerving myself to meet dreary nights and monotonous
days but summer itself was not more jolly than winter at Rivermouth
Snowballing at school skating on the Mill Pond coasting by moonlight
long rides behind Gypsy in a brandnew little sleigh built expressly for
her were sports no less exhilarating than those which belonged to the
sunny months And then Thanksgiving The nose of Memorywhy shouldnt
Memory have a nosedilates with pleasure over the rich perfume of Miss
Abigails forty mincepies each one more delightful than the other
like the Sultans forty wives Christmas was another redletter day
though it was not so generally observed in New England as it is now

The great woodfire in the tiled chimneyplace made our sittingroom
very cheerful of winter nights When the northwind howled about
the eaves and the sharp fingers of the sleet tapped against the
windowpanes it was nice to be so warmly sheltered from the storm A
dish of apples and a pitcher of chilly cider were always served during
the evening The Captain had a funny way of leaning back in the chair
and eating his apple with his eyes closed Sometimes I played dominos
with him and sometimes Miss Abigail read aloud to us pronouncing to
toe and sounding all the eds

In a former chapter I alluded to Miss Abigails managing propensities
She had affected many changes in the Nutter House before I came there
to live but there was one thing against which she had long contended
without being able to overcome This was the Captains pipe On
first taking command of the household she prohibited smoking in the
sittingroom where it had been the old gentlemans custom to take a
whiff or two of the fragrant weed after meals The edict went forthand
so did the pipe An excellent move no doubt but then the house was
his and if he saw fit to keep a tub of tobacco burning in the middle of
the parlor floor he had a perfect right to do so However he humored
her in this as in other matters and smoked by stealth like a guilty
creature in the barn or about the gardens That was practicable in
summer but in winter the Captain was hard put to it When he couldnt
stand it longer he retreated to his bedroom and barricaded the door
Such was the position of affairs at the time of which I write

One morning a few days after the great snow as Miss Abigail was
dusting the chronometer in the ball she beheld Captain Nutter slowly
descending the staircase with a long clay pipe in his mouth Miss
Abigail could hardly credit her own eyes

Danel she gasped retiring heavily on the hatrack

The tone of reproach with which this word was uttered failed to produce
the slightest effect on the Captain who merely removed the pipe from
his lips for an instant and blew a cloud into the chilly air The
thermometer stood at two degrees below zero in our hall

Danel cried Miss Abigail hystericallyDanel dont come near me
Whereupon she fainted away for the smell of tobaccosmoke always made
her deadly sick

Kitty Collins rushed from the kitchen with a basin of water and set to
work bathing Miss Abigails temples and chafing her hands I thought
my grandfather rather cruel as he stood there with a halfsmile on his
countenance complacently watching Miss Abigails sufferings When she
was brought to the Captain sat down beside her and with a lovely
twinkle in his eye said softly

Abigail my dear there wasnt any tobacco in that Pipe It was a new
pipe I fetched it down for Tom to blow soapbubbles with

At these words Kitty Collins hurried away her featuresworking
strangely Several minutes later I came upon her in the scullery with
the greater portion of a crash towel stuffed into her mouth Miss
Abygil smelt the terbacca with her oi cried Kitty partially removing
the cloth and then immediately stopping herself up again

The Captains joke furnished usthat is Kitty and mewith mirth for
many a day as to Miss Abigail I think she never wholly pardoned
him After this Captain Nutter gradually gave up smoking which is an
untidy injurious disgraceful and highly pleasant habit

A boys life in a secluded New England town in winter does not afford
many points for illustration Of course he gets his ears or toes
frostbitten of course he smashes his sled against another boys of
course be bangs his bead on the ice and hes a lad of no enterprise
whatever if he doesnt manage to skate into an eelhole and be brought
home half drowned All these things happened to me but as they lack
novelty I pass them over to tell you about the famous snowfort which
we built on Slatters Hill




Chapter ThirteenThe Snow Fort on Slatters Hill


The memory of man even that of the Oldest Inhabitant runneth not back
to the time when there did not exist a feud between the North End and
the South End boys of Rivermouth

The origin of the feud is involved in mystery it is impossible to say
which party was the first aggressor in the faroff anterevolutionary
ages but the fact remains that the youngsters of those antipodal
sections entertained a mortal hatred for each other and that this
hatred had been handed down from generation to generation like Miles
Standishs punchbowl

I know not what laws natural or unnatural regulated the warmth of the
quarrel but at some seasons it raged more violently than at others
This winter both parties were unusually lively and antagonistic
Great was the wrath of the SouthEnders when they discovered that the
NorthEnders had thrown up a fort on the crown of Slatters Hill

Slatters Hill or Nomansland as it was generally called was a
rise of ground covering perhaps an acre and a quarter situated on
an imaginary line marking the boundary between the two districts An
immense stratum of granite which here and there thrust out a wrinkled
boulder prevented the site from being used for building purposes The
street ran on either side of the hill from one part of which a quantity
of rock had been removed to form the underpinning of the new jail
This excavation made the approach from that point all but impossible
especially when the ragged ledges were aglitter with ice You see what
a spot it was for a snowfort

One evening twenty or thirty of the NorthEnders quietly took possession
of Slatters Hill and threw up a strong line of breastworks something
after this shape

Ft Slatter graphic

The rear of the entrenchment being protected by the quarry was left
open The walls were four feet high and twentytwo inches thick
strengthened at the angles by stakes driven firmly into the ground

Fancy the rage of the SouthEnders the next day when they spied our
snowy citadel with Jack Harriss red silk pocket handkerchief floating
defiantly from the flagstaff

In less than an hour it was known all over town in military circles at
least that the Puddledockers and the Riverrats these were the
derisive subtitles bestowed on our SouthEnd foes intended to attack
the fort that Saturday afternoon

At two oclock all the fighting boys of the Temple Grammar School
and as many recruits as we could muster lay behind the walls of Fort
Slatter with three hundred compact snowballs piled up in pyramids
awaiting the approach of the enemy The enemy was not slow in making his
approachfifty strong headed by one Mat Ames Our forces were under the
command of General J Harris

Before the action commenced a meeting was arranged between the rival
commanders who drew up and signed certain rules and regulations
respecting the conduct of the battle As it was impossible for the
NorthEnders to occupy the fort permanently it was stipulated that the
SouthEnders should assault it only on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons
between the hours of two and six For them to take possession of the
place at any other time was not to constitute a capture but on the
contrary was to be considered a dishonorable and cowardly act

The NorthEnders on the other hand agreed to give up the fort whenever
ten of the storming party succeeded in obtaining at one time a footing
on the parapet and were able to hold the same for the space of two
minutes Both sides were to abstain from putting pebbles into their
snowballs nor was it permissible to use frozen ammunition A snowball
soaked in water and left out to cool was a projectile which in previous
years had been resorted to with disastrous results

These preliminaries settled the commanders retired to their respective
corps The interview had taken place on the hillside between the
opposing lines

General Harris divided his men into two bodies the first comprised the
most skilful marksmen or gunners the second the reserve force was
composed of the strongest boys whose duty it was to repel the scaling
parties and to make occasional sallies for the purpose of capturing
prisoners who were bound by the articles of treaty to faithfully serve
under our flag until they were exchanged at the close of the day

The repellers were called light infantry but when they carried on
operations beyond the fort they became cavalry It was also their duty
when not otherwise engaged to manufacture snowballs The Generals
staff consisted of five Templars I among the number with the rank of
Major who carried the Generals orders and looked after the wounded

General Mat Ames a veteran commander was no less wideawake in the
disposition of his army Five companies each numbering but six men
in order not to present too big a target to our sharpshooters were to
charge the fort from different points their advance being covered by a
heavy fire from the gunners posted in the rear Each scaler was provided
with only two rounds of ammunition which were not to be used until he
had mounted the breastwork and could deliver his shots on our heads

The drawing below represents the interior of the fort just previous to
the assault Nothing on earth could represent the state of things after
the first volley

Fort Slatter detail graphic

The thrilling moment had now arrived If I had been going into a real
engagement I could not have been more deeply impressed by the importance
of the occasion

The fort opened fire firsta single ball from the dexterous band of
General Harris taking General Ames in the very pit of his stomach A
cheer went up from Fort Slatter In an instant the air was thick with
flying missiles in the midst of which we dimly descried the storming
parties sweeping up the hill shoulder to shoulder The shouts of the
leaders and the snowballs bursting like shells about our ears made it
very lively

Not more than a dozen of the enemy succeeded in reaching the crest of
the hill five of these clambered upon the icy walls where they were
instantly grabbed by the legs and jerked into the fort The rest retired
confused and blinded by our welldirected fire

When General Harris with his right eye bunged up said Soldiers I am
proud of you my heart swelled in my bosom

The victory however had not been without its price Six NorthEnders
having rushed out to harass the discomfited enemy were gallantly
cut off by General Ames and captured Among these were Lieutenant P
Whitcomb who had no business to join in the charge being weak in the
knees and Captain Fred Langdon of General Harriss staff Whitcomb
was one of the most notable shots on our side though he was not much
to boast of in a roughandtumble fight owing to the weakness before
mentioned General Ames put him among the gunners and we were quickly
made aware of the loss we had sustained by receiving a frequent artful
ball which seemed to light with unerring instinct on any nose that was
the least bit exposed I have known one of Peppers snowballs fired
pointblank to turn a corner and hit a boy who considered himself
absolutely safe

But we had no time for vain regrets The battle raged Already there
were two bad cases of black eye and one of nosebleed in the hospital

It was glorious excitement those pellmell onslaughts and handtohand
struggles Twice we were within an ace of being driven from our
stronghold when General Harris and his staff leaped recklessly upon the
ramparts and hurled the besiegers heels over head down hill

At sunset the garrison of Fort Slatter was still unconquered and the
SouthEnders in a solid phalanx marched off whistling Yankee Doodle
while we cheered and jeered them until they were out of hearing

General Ames remained behind to effect an exchange of prisoners We held
thirteen of his men and he eleven of ours General Ames proposed to
call it an even thing since many of his eleven prisoners were officers
while nearly all our thirteen captives were privates A dispute arising
on this point the two noble generals came to fisticuffs and in
the fracas our brave commander got his remaining well eye badly damaged
This didnt prevent him from writing a general order the next day on a
slate in which he complimented the troops on their heroic behavior

On the following Wednesday the siege was renewed I forget whether it
was on that afternoon or the next that we lost Fort Slatter but lose it
we did with much valuable ammunition and several men After a series
of desperate assaults we forced General Ames to capitulate and he in
turn made the place too hot to hold us So from day to day the tide
of battle surged to and fro sometimes favoring our arms and sometimes
those of the enemy

General Ames handled his men with great skill his deadliest foe could
not deny that Once he outgeneralled our commander in the following
manner He massed his gunners on our left and opened a brisk fire under
cover of which a single company six men advanced on that angle of the
fort Our reserves on the right rushed over to defend the threatened
point Meanwhile four companies of the enemys scalers made a detour
round the foot of the hill and dashed into Fort Slatter without
opposition At the same moment General Amess gunners closed in on our
left and there we were between two fires Of course we had to vacate
the fort A cloud rested on General Harriss military reputation until
his superior tactics enabled him to dispossess the enemy

As the winter wore on the warspirit waxed fiercer and fiercer At
length the provision against using heavy substances in the snowballs
was disregarded A ball stuck full of sandbird shot came tearing into
Fort Slatter In retaliation General Harris ordered a broadside of
shells i e snowballs containing marbles After this both sides
never failed to freeze their ammunition

It was no longer childs play to march up to the walls of Fort Slatter
nor was the position of the besieged less perilous At every assault
three or four boys on each side were disabled It was not an infrequent
occurrence for the combatants to hold up a flag of truce while they
removed some insensible comrade

Matters grew worse and worse Seven NorthEnders had been seriously
wounded and a dozen SouthEnders were reported on the sick list
The selectmen of the town awoke to the fact of what was going on and
detailed a posse of police to prevent further disturbance The boys at
the foot of the hill SouthEnders as it happened finding themselves
assailed in the rear and on the flank turned round and attempted
to beat off the watchmen In this they were sustained by numerous
volunteers from the fort who looked upon the interference as
tyrannical

The watch were determined fellows and charged the boys valiantly
driving them all into the fort where we made common cause fighting
side by side like the best of friends In vain the four guardians of the
peace rushed up the hill flourishing their clubs and calling upon us to
surrender They could not get within ten yards of the fort our fire was
so destructive In one of the onsets a man named Mugridge more valorous
than his peers threw himself upon the parapet when he was seized by
twenty pairs of hands and dragged inside the breastwork where fifteen
boys sat down on him to keep him quiet

Perceiving that it was impossible with their small number to dislodge
us the watch sent for reinforcements Their call was responded to not
only by the whole constabulary force eight men but by a numerous
body of citizens who had become alarmed at the prospect of a riot This
formidable array brought us to our senses we began to think that maybe
discretion was the better part of valor General Harris and General
Ames with their respective staffs held a council of war in the
hospital and a backward movement was decided on So after one grand
farewell volley we fled sliding jumping rolling tumbling down the
quarry at the rear of the fort and escaped without losing a man

But we lost Fort Slatter forever Those battlescarred ramparts were
razed to the ground and humiliating ashes sprinkled over the historic
spot near which a solitary lynxeyed policeman was seen prowling from
time to time during the rest of the winter

The event passed into a legend and afterwards when later instances of
pluck and endurance were spoken of the boys would say By golly You
ought to have been at the fights on Slatters Hill




Chapter FourteenThe Cruise of the Dolphin


It was spring again The snow had faded away like a dream and we were
awakened so to speak by the sudden chirping of robins in our back
garden Marvellous transformation of snowdrifts into lilacs wondrous
miracle of the unfolding leaf We read in the Holy Book how our Saviour
at the marriagefeast changed the water into wine we pause and wonder
but every hour a greater miracle is wrought at our very feet if we have
but eyes to see it

I had now been a year at Rivermouth If you do not know what sort of boy
I was it is not because I havent been frank with you Of my progress
at school I say little for this is a story pure and simple and not
a treatise on education Behold me however well up in most of the
classes I have worn my Latin grammar into tatters and am in the first
book of Virgil I interlard my conversation at home with easy quotations
from that poet and impress Captain Nutter with a lofty notion of my
learning I am likewise translating Les Aventures de Telemaque from the
French and shall tackle Blairs Lectures the next term I am ashamed of
my crude composition about The Horse and can do better now Sometimes
my head almost aches with the variety of my knowledge I consider Mr
Grimshaw the greatest scholar that ever lived and I dont know which I
would rather bea learned man like him or a circus rider

My thoughts revert to this particular spring more frequently than to any
other period of my boyhood for it was marked by an event that left an
indelible impression on my memory As I pen these pages I feel that
I am writing of something which happened yesterday so vividly it all
comes back to me

Every Rivermouth boy looks upon the sea as being in some way mixed up
with his destiny While he is yet a baby lying in his cradle he hears
the dull faroff boom of the breakers when he is older he wanders by
the sandy shore watching the waves that come plunging up the beach
like whitemaned seahorses as Thoreau calls them his eye follows the
lessening sail as it fades into the blue horizon and he burns for the
time when he shall stand on the quarterdeck of his own ship and go
sailing proudly across that mysterious waste of waters

Then the town itself is full of hints and flavors of the sea The gables
and roofs of the houses facing eastward are covered with red rust like
the flukes of old anchors a salty smell pervades the air and dense
gray fogs the very breath of Ocean periodically creep up into the
quiet streets and envelop everything The terrific storms that lash
the coast the kelp and spars and sometimes the bodies of drowned men
tossed on shore by the scornful waves the shipyards the wharves and
the tawny fleet of fishingsmacks yearly fitted out at Rivermouththese
things and a hundred other feed the imagination and fill the brain of
every healthy boy with dreams of adventure He learns to swim almost
as soon as he can walk he draws in with his mothers milk the art of
handling an oar he is born a sailor whatever he may turn out to be
afterwards

To own the whole or a portion of a rowboat is his earliest ambition
No wonder that I born to this life and coming back to it with freshest
sympathies should have caught the prevailing infection No wonder I
longed to buy a part of the trim little sailboat Dolphin which chanced
just then to be in the market This was in the latter part of May

Three shares at five or six dollars each I forget which had already
been taken by Phil Adams Fred Langdon and Binny Wallace The fourth
and remaining share hung fire Unless a purchaser could be found for
this the bargain was to fall through

I am afraid I required but slight urging to join in the investment
I had four dollars and fifty cents on hand and the treasurer of the
Centipedes advanced me the balance receiving my silver pencilcase as
ample security It was a proud moment when I stood on the wharf with my
partners inspecting the Dolphin moored at the foot of a very slippery
flight of steps She was painted white with a green stripe outside and
on the stern a yellow dolphin with its scarlet mouth wide open stared
with a surprised expression at its own reflection in the water The boat
was a great bargain

I whirled my cap in the air and ran to the stairs leading down from the
wharf when a hand was laid gently on my shoulder I turned and faced
Captain Nutter I never saw such an old sharpeye as he was in those
days

I knew he wouldnt be angry with me for buying a rowboat but I also
knew that the little bowsprit suggesting a jib and the tapering mast
ready for its few square feet of canvas were trifles not likely to
meet his approval As far as rowing on the river among the wharves was
concerned the Captain had long since withdrawn his decided objections
having convinced himself by going out with me several times that I
could manage a pair of sculls as well as anybody

I was right in my surmises He commanded me in the most emphatic
terms never to go out in the Dolphin without leaving the mast in the
boathouse This curtailed my anticipated sport but the pleasure of
having a pull whenever I wanted it remained I never disobeyed the
Captains orders touching the sail though I sometimes extended my row
beyond the points he had indicated

The river was dangerous for sailboats Squalls without the slightest
warning were of frequent occurrence scarcely a year passed that six or
seven persons were not drowned under the very windows of the town and
these oddly enough were generally seacaptains who either did not
understand the river or lacked the skill to handle a small craft

A knowledge of such disasters one of which I witnessed consoled me
somewhat when I saw Phil Adams skimming over the water in a spanking
breeze with every stitch of canvas set There were few better yachtsmen
than Phil Adams He usually went sailing alone for both Fred Langdon
and Binny Wallace were under the same restrictions I was

Not long after the purchase of the boat we planned an excursion to
Sandpeep Island the last of the islands in the harbor We proposed to
start early in the morning and return with the tide in the moonlight
Our only difficulty was to obtain a whole days exemption from school
the customary halfholiday not being long enough for our picnic
Somehow we couldnt work it but fortune arranged it for us I may
say here that whatever else I did I never played truant hookey we
called it in my life

One afternoon the four owners of the Dolphin exchanged significant
glances when Mr Grimshaw announced from the desk that there would be
no school the following day he having just received intelligence of the
death of his uncle in Boston I was sincerely attached to Mr Grimshaw
but I am afraid that the death of his uncle did not affect me as it
ought to have done

We were up before sunrise the next morning in order to take advantage
of the flood tide which waits for no man Our preparations for the
cruise were made the previous evening In the way of eatables and
drinkables we had stored in the stem of the Dolphin a generous bag
of hardtack for the chowder a piece of pork to fry the cunners in
three gigantic applepies bought at Pettingils half a dozen lemons
and a keg of springwaterthe lastnamed article we slung over the
side to keep it cool as soon as we got under way The crockery and
the bricks for our campstove we placed in the bows with the groceries
which included sugar pepper salt and a bottle of pickles Phil Adams
contributed to the outfit a small tent of unbleached cotton cloth under
which we intended to take our nooning

We unshipped the mast threw in an extra oar and were ready to embark
I do not believe that Christopher Columbus when he started on his
rather successful voyage of discovery felt half the responsibility
and importance that weighed upon me as I sat on the middle seat of the
Dolphin with my oar resting in the rowlock I wonder if Christopher
Columbus quietly slipped out of the house without letting his estimable
family know what he was up to

Charley Marden whose father had promised to cane him if he ever stepped
foot on sail or rowboat came down to the wharf in a sourgrape humor
to see us off Nothing would tempt him to go out on the river in such
a crazy clamshell of a boat He pretended that he did not expect
to behold us alive again and tried to throw a wet blanket over the
expedition

Guess youll have a squally time of it said Charley casting off
the painter Ill drop in at old Newburys Newbury was the parish
undertaker and leave word as I go along

Bosh muttered Phil Adams sticking the boathook into the
stringpiece of the wharf and sending the Dolphin half a dozen yards
towards the current

How calm and lovely the river was Not a ripple stirred on the glassy
surface broken only by the sharp cutwater of our tiny craft The sun
as round and red as an August moon was by this time peering above the
waterline

The town had drifted behind us and we were entering among the group of
islands Sometimes we could almost touch with our boathook the shelving
banks on either side As we neared the mouth of the harbor a little
breeze now and then wrinkled the blue water shook the spangles from
the foliage and gently lifted the spiral mistwreaths that still clung
along shore The measured dip of our oars and the drowsy twitterings
of the birds seemed to mingle with rather than break the enchanted
silence that reigned about us

The scent of the new clover comes back to me now as I recall that
delicious morning when we floated away in a fairy boat down a river like
a dream

The sun was well up when the nose of the Dolphin nestled against the
snowwhite bosom of Sandpeep Island This island as I have said before
was the last of the cluster one side of it being washed by the sea We
landed on the riverside the sloping sands and quiet water affording us
a good place to moor the boat

It took us an hour or two to transport our stores to the spot selected
for the encampment Having pitched our tent using the five oars to
support the canvas we got out our lines and went down the rocks
seaward to fish It was early for cunners but we were lucky enough to
catch as nice a mess as ever you saw A cod for the chowder was not so
easily secured At last Binny Wallace hauled in a plump little fellow
crusted all over with flaky silver

To skin the fish build our fireplace and cook the chowder kept us
busy the next two hours The fresh air and the exercise had given us the
appetites of wolves and we were about famished by the time the savory
mixture was ready for our clamshell saucers

I shall not insult the rising generation on the seaboard by telling them
how delectable is a chowder compounded and eaten in this Robinson Crusoe
fashion As for the boys who live inland and know naught of such marine
feasts my heart is full of pity for them What wasted lives Not to
know the delights of a clambake not to love chowder to be ignorant of
lobscouse

How happy we were we four sitting crosslegged in the crisp salt grass
with the invigorating seabreeze blowing gratefully through our hair
What a joyous thing was life and how far off seemed deathdeath that
lurks in all pleasant places and was so near

The banquet finished Phil Adams drew from his pocket a handful of
sweetfern cigars but as none of the party could indulge without
imminent risk of becoming sick we all on one pretext or another
declined and Phil smoked by himself

The wind had freshened by this and we found it comfortable to put
on the jackets which had been thrown aside in the heat of the day
We strolled along the beach and gathered large quantities of the
fairywoven Iceland moss which at certain seasons is washed to these
shores then we played at ducks and drakes and then the sun being
sufficiently low we went in bathing

Before our bath was ended a slight change had come over the sky and sea
fleecywhite clouds scudded here and there and a muffled moan from the
breakers caught our ears from time to time While we were dressing a
few hurried drops of rain came lisping down and we adjourned to the
tent to await the passing of the squall

Were all right anyhow said Phil Adams It wont be much of a blow
and well be as snug as a bug in a rug here in the tent particularly
if we have that lemonade which some of you fellows were going to make

By an oversight the lemons had been left in the boat Binny Wallace
volunteered to go for them

Put an extra stone on the painter Binny said Adams calling after
him it would be awkward to have the Dolphin give us the slip and
return to port minus her passengers

That it would answered Binny scrambling down the rocks

Sandpeep Island is diamondshapedone point running out into the sea
and the other looking towards the town Our tent was on the riverside
Though the Dolphin was also on the same side it lay out of sight by the
beach at the farther extremity of the island

Binny Wallace had been absent five or six minutes when we heard him
calling our several names in tones that indicated distress or surprise
we could not tell which Our first thought was The boat has broken
adrift

We sprung to our feet and hastened down to the beach On turning the
bluff which hid the mooringplace from our view we found the conjecture
correct Not only was the Dolphin afloat but poor little Binny Wallace
was standing in the bows with his arms stretched helplessly towards
usdrifting out to sea

Head the boat in shore shouted Phil Adams

Wallace ran to the tiller but the slight cockleshell merely swung
round and drifted broadside on O if we had but left a single scull in
the Dolphin

Can you swim it cried Adams desperately using his hand as a
speakingtrumpet for the distance between the boat and the island
widened momentarily

Binny Wallace looked down at the sea which was covered with white caps
and made a despairing gesture He knew and we knew that the stoutest
swimmer could not live forty seconds in those angry waters

A wild insane light came into Phil Adamss eyes as he stood kneedeep
in the boiling surf and for an instant I think he meditated plunging
into the ocean after the receding boat

The sky darkened and an ugly look stole rapidly over the broken surface
of the sea

Binny Wallace half rose from his seat in the stem and waved his hand
to us in token of farewell In spite of the distance increasing every
instant we could see his face plainly The anxious expression it wore
at first had passed It was pale and meek now and I love to think there
was a kind of halo about it like that which painters place around the
forehead of a saint So he drifted away

The sky grew darker and darker It was only by straining our eyes
through the unnatural twilight that we could keep the Dolphin in sight
The figure of Binny Wallace was no longer visible for the boat itself
had dwindled to a mere white dot on the black water Now we lost it and
our hearts stopped throbbing and now the speck appeared again for an
instant on the crest of a high wave

Finally it went out like a spark and we saw it no more Then we gazed
at each other and dared not speak

Absorbed in following the course of the boat we had scarcely noticed
the huddled inky clouds that sagged down all around us From these
threatening masses seamed at intervals with pale lightning there now
burst a heavy peal of thunder that shook the ground under our feet A
sudden squall struck the sea ploughing deep white furrows into it and
at the same instant a single piercing shriek rose above the tempestthe
frightened cry of a gull swooping over the island How it startled us

It was impossible any longer to keep our footing on the beach The wind
and the breakers would have swept us into the ocean if we had not clung
to each other with the desperation of drowning men Taking advantage of
a momentary lull we crawled up the sands on our hands and knees and
pausing in the lee of the granite ledge to gain breath returned to the
camp where we found that the gale had snapped all the fastenings of
the tent but one Held by this the puffedout canvas swayed in the wind
like a balloon It was a task of some difficulty to secure it which we
did by beating down the canvas with the oars

After several trials we succeeded in setting up the tent on the leeward
side of the ledge Blinded by the vivid flashes of lightning and
drenched by the rain which fell in torrents we crept half dead with
fear and anguish under our flimsy shelter Neither the anguish nor the
fear was on our own account for we were comparatively safe but for
poor little Binny Wallace driven out to sea in the merciless gale We
shuddered to think of him in that frail shell drifting on and on to his
grave the sky rent with lightning over his head and the green abysses
yawning beneath him We fell to crying the three of us and cried I
know not how long

Meanwhile the storm raged with augmented fury We were obliged to hold
on to the ropes of the tent to prevent it blowing away The spray
from the river leaped several yards up the rocks and clutched at us
malignantly The very island trembled with the concussions of the sea
beating upon it and at times I fancied that it had broken loose from
its foundation and was floating off with us The breakers streaked
with angry phosphorus were fearful to look at

The wind rose higher and higher cutting long slits in the tent through
which the rain poured incessantly To complete the sum of our miseries
the night was at hand It came down suddenly at last like a curtain
shutting in Sandpeep island from all the world

It was a dirty night as the sailors say The darkness was something
that could be felt as well as seenit pressed down upon one with a cold
clammy touch Gazing into the hollow blackness all sorts of imaginable
shapes seemed to start forth from vacancybrilliant colors stars
prisms and dancing lights What boy lying awake at night has not
amused or terrified himself by peopling the spaces around his bed with
these phenomena of his own eyes

I say whispered Fred Langdon at length clutching my hand dont
you see thingsout therein the dark

Yes yesBinny Wallaces face

I added to my own nervousness by making this avowal though for the
last ten minutes I had seen little besides that starpale face with
its angelic hair and brows First a slim yellow circle like the nimbus
round the moon took shape and grew sharp against the darkness then
this faded gradually and there was the Face wearing the same sad
sweet look it wore when he waved his hand to us across the awful water
This optical illusion kept repeating itself

And I too said Adams I see it every now and then outside there
What wouldnt I give if it really was poor little Wallace looking in at
us O boys how shall we dare to go back to the town without him Ive
wished a hundred times since weve been sitting here that I was in his
place alive or dead

We dreaded the approach of morning as much as we longed for it The
morning would tell us all Was it possible for the Dolphin to outride
such a storm There was a lighthouse on Mackerel Reef which lay
directly in the course the boat had taken when it disappeared If the
Dolphin had caught on this reef perhaps Binny Wallace was safe Perhaps
his cries had been heard by the keeper of the light The man owned a
lifeboat and had rescued several people Who could tell

Such were the questions we asked ourselves again and again as we lay in
each others arms waiting for daybreak What an endless night it was I
have known months that did not seem so long

Our position was irksome rather than perilous for the day was certain
to bring us relief from the town where our prolonged absence together
with the storm had no doubt excited the liveliest alarm for our safety
But the cold the darkness and the suspense were hard to bear

Our soaked jackets had chilled us to the bone To keep warm we lay
huddled together so closely that we could bear our hearts beat above the
tumult of sea and sky

After a while we grew very hungry not having broken our fast since
early in the day The rain had turned the hardtack into a sort of
dough but it was better than nothing

We used to laugh at Fred Langdon for always carrying in his pocket a
small vial of essence of peppermint or sassafras a few drops of which
sprinkled on a lump of loafsugar he seemed to consider a great luxury
I dont know what would have become of us at this crisis if it hadnt
been for that omnipresent bottle of hot stuff We poured the stinging
liquid over our sugar which had kept dry in a sardinebox and warmed
ourselves with frequent doses

After four or five hours the rain ceased the wind died away to a moan
and the seano longer raging like a maniacsobbed and sobbed with a
piteous human voice all along the coast And well it might after that
nights work Twelve sail of the Gloucester fishing fleet had gone down
with every soul on board just outside of Whalesback Light Think of
the wide grief that follows in the wake of one wreck then think of the
despairing women who wrung their hands and wept the next morning in
the streets of Gloucester Marblehead and Newcastle

Though our strength was nearly spent we were too cold to sleep Once
I sunk into a troubled doze when I seemed to bear Charley Mardens
parting words only it was the Sea that said them After that I threw
off the drowsiness whenever it threatened to overcome me

Fred Langdon was the earliest to discover a filmy luminous streak in
the sky the first glimmering of sunrise

Look it is nearly daybreak

While we were following the direction of his finger a sound of distant
oars fell on our ears

We listened breathlessly and as the dip of the blades became more
audible we discerned two foggy lights like willothewisps floating
on the river

Running down to the waters edge we hailed the boats with all
our might The call was heard for the oars rested a moment in the
rowlocks and then pulled in towards the island

It was two boats from the town in the foremost of which we could now
make out the figures of Captain Nutter and Binny Wallaces father We
shrunk back on seeing him

Thank God cried Mr Wallace fervently as he leaped from the wherry
without waiting for the bow to touch the beach

But when he saw only three boys standing on the sands his eye wandered
restlessly about in quest of the fourth then a deadly pallor overspread
his features

Our story was soon told A solemn silence fell upon the crowd of rough
boatmen gathered round interrupted only by a stifled sob from one poor
old man who stood apart from the rest

The sea was still running too high for any small boat to venture out so
it was arranged that the wherry should take us back to town leaving the
yawl with a picked crew to hug the island until daybreak and then set
forth in search of the Dolphin

Though it was barely sunrise when we reached town there were a great
many people assembled at the landing eager for intelligence from missing
boats Two picnic parties had started down river the day before just
previous to the gale and nothing had been beard of them It turned out
that the pleasureseekers saw their danger in time and ran ashore on
one of the least exposed islands where they passed the night Shortly
after our own arrival they appeared off Rivermouth much to the joy of
their friends in two shattered dismasted boats

The excitement over I was in a forlorn state physically and mentally
Captain Nutter put me to bed between hot blankets and sent Kitty
Collins for the doctor I was wandering in my mind and fancied myself
still on Sandpeep Island now we were building our brickstove to cook
the chowder and in my delirium I laughed aloud and shouted to my
comrades now the sky darkened and the squall struck the island now I
gave orders to Wallace how to manage the boat and now I cried because
the rain was pouring in on me through the holes in the tent Towards
evening a high fever set in and it was many days before my grandfather
deemed it prudent to tell me that the Dolphin had been found floating
keel upwards four miles southeast of Mackerel Reef

Poor little Binny Wallace How strange it seemed when I went to
school again to see that empty seat in the fifth row How gloomy the
playground was lacking the sunshine of his gentle sensitive face One
day a folded sheet slipped from my algebra it was the last note he ever
wrote me I couldnt read it for the tears

What a pang shot across my heart the afternoon it was whispered through
the town that a body had been washed ashore at Grave Pointthe place
where we bathed We bathed there no more How well I remember the
funeral and what a piteous sight it was afterwards to see his familiar
name on a small headstone in the Old South Burying Ground

Poor little Binny Wallace Always the same to me The rest of us have
grown up into hard worldly men fighting the fight of life but you
are forever young and gentle and pure a part of my own childhood
that time cannot wither always a little boy always poor little Binny
Wallace




Chapter FifteenAn Old Acquaintance Turns Up


A year had stolen by since the death of Binny Wallacea year of which I
have nothing important to record

The loss of our little playmate threw a shadow over our young lives for
many and many a month The Dolphin rose and fell with the tide at the
foot of the slippery steps unused the rest of the summer At the close
of November we hauled her sadly into the boathouse for the winter but
when spring came round we launched the Dolphin again and often went
down to the wharf and looked at her lying in the tangled eelgrass
without much inclination to take a row The associations connected with
the boat were too painful as yet but time which wears the sharp edge
from everything softened this feeling and one afternoon we brought out
the cobwebbed oars

The ice once broken brief trips along the wharveswe seldom cared to
go out into the river nowbecame one of our chief amusements Meanwhile
Gypsy was not forgotten Every clear morning I was in the saddle
before breakfast and there are few roads or lanes within ten miles of
Rivermouth that have not borne the print of her vagrant hoof

I studied like a good fellow this quarter carrying off a couple of
first prizes The Captain expressed his gratification by presenting me
with a new silver dollar If a dollar in his eyes was smaller than a
cartwheel it wasnt so very much smaller I redeemed my pencilcase
from the treasurer of the Centipedes and felt that I was getting on in
the world

It was at this time I was greatly cast down by a letter from my father
saying that he should be unable to visit Rivermouth until the following
year With that letter came another to Captain Nutter which he did not
read aloud to the family as usual It was on business he said folding
it up in his wallet He received several of these business letters from
time to time and I noticed that they always made him silent and moody

The fact is my fathers bankinghouse was not thriving The
unlookedfor failure of a firm largely indebted to him had crippled
the house When the Captain imparted this information to me I didnt
trouble myself over the matter I supposedif I supposed anythingthat
all grownup people had more or less money when they wanted it Whether
they inherited it or whether government supplied them was not clear
to me A loose idea that my father had a private goldmine somewhere or
other relieved me of all uneasiness

I was not far from right Every man has within himself a goldmine whose
riches are limited only by his own industry It is true it sometimes
happens that industry does not avail if a man lacks that something
which for want of a better name we call Luck My father was a person
of untiring energy and ability but he had no luck To use a Rivermouth
saying he was always catching sculpins when everyone else with the same
bait was catching mackerel

It was more than two years since I had seen my parents I felt that I
could not bear a longer separation Every letter from New Orleanswe
got two or three a monthgave me a fit of homesickness and when it was
definitely settled that my father and mother were to remain in the South
another twelvemonth I resolved to go to them

Since Binny Wallaces death Pepper Whitcomb had been my fidus Achates
we occupied desks near each other at school and were always together
in play hours We rigged a twine telegraph from his garret window to
the scuttle of the Nutter House and sent messages to each other in
a matchbox We shared our pocketmoney and our secretsthose amazing
secrets which boys have We met in lonely places by stealth and parted
like conspirators we couldnt buy a jackknife or build a kite without
throwing an air of mystery and guilt over the transaction

I naturally hastened to lay my New Orleans project before Pepper
Whitcomb having dragged him for that purpose to a secluded spot in the
dark pine woods outside the town Pepper listened to me with a gravity
which he will not be able to surpass when he becomes Chief Justice and
strongly advised me to go

The summer vacation said Pepper lasts six weeks that will give you
a fortnight to spend in New Orleans allowing two weeks each way for the
journey

I wrung his hand and begged him to accompany me offering to defray
all the expenses I wasnt anything if I wasnt princely in those days
After considerable urging he consented to go on terms so liberal The
whole thing was arranged there was nothing to do now but to advise
Captain Nutter of my plan which I did the next day

The possibility that he might oppose the tour never entered my head I
was therefore totally unprepared for the vigorous negative which met
my proposal I was deeply mortified moreover for there was Pepper
Whitcomb on the wharf at the foot of the street waiting for me to come
and let him know what day we were to start

Go to New Orleans Go to Jericho exclaimed Captain Nutter Youd
look pretty you two philandering off like the babes in the wood
twentyfive hundred miles with all the world before you where to
choose

And the Captains features which had worn an indignant air as he began
the sentence relaxed into a broad smile Whether it was at the felicity
of his own quotation or at the mental picture he drew of Pepper and
myself on our travels

I couldnt tell and I didnt care I was heartbroken How could I face
my chum after all the dazzling inducements I had held out to him

My grandfather seeing that I took the matter seriously pointed out
the difficulties of such a journey and the great expense involved He
entered into the details of my fathers money troubles and succeeded
in making it plain to me that my wishes under the circumstances were
somewhat unreasonable It was in no cheerful mood that I joined Pepper
at the end of the wharf

I found that young gentleman leaning against the bulkhead gazing
intently towards the islands in the harbor He had formed a telescope of
his hands and was so occupied with his observations as to be oblivious
of my approach

Hullo cried Pepper dropping his hands Look there Isnt that a
bark coming up the Narrows

Where

Just at the left of Fishcrate Island Dont you see the foremast
peeping above the old derrick

Sure enough it was a vessel of considerable size slowly beating up to
town In a few moments more the other two masts were visible above the
green hillocks

Foretopmasts blown away said Pepper Putting in for repairs I
guess

As the bark lazily crept from behind the last of the islands she let go
her anchors and swung round with the tide Then the gleeful chant of
the sailors at the capstan came to us pleasantly across the water The
vessel lay within three quarters of a mile of us and we could plainly
see the men at the davits lowering the starboard longboat It no sooner
touched the stream than a dozen of the crew scrambled like mice over the
side of the merchantman

In a neglected seaport like Rivermouth the arrival of a large ship is an
event of moment The prospect of having twenty or thirty jolly tars
let loose on the peaceful town excites divers emotions among the
inhabitants The small shopkeepers along the wharves anticipate a
thriving trade the proprietors of the two rival boardinghousesthe
Wee Drop and the Mariners Homehasten down to the landing to secure
lodgers and the female population of Anchor Lane turn out to a woman
for a ship fresh from sea is always full of possible husbands and
longlost prodigal sons

But aside from this there is scant welcome given to a ships crew in
Rivermouth The toilworn mariner is a sad fellow ashore judging him by
a severe moral standard

Once I remember a United States frigate came into port for repairs
after a storm She lay in the river a fortnight or more and every day
sent us a gang of sixty or seventy of our countrys gallant defenders
who spread themselves over the town doing all sorts of mad things They
were goodnatured enough but full of old Sancho The Wee Drop proved
a drop too much for many of them They went singing through the streets
at midnight wringing off doorknockers shinning up waterspouts and
frightening the Oldest Inhabitant nearly to death by popping their
heads into his secondstory window and shouting Fire One morning a
bluejacket was discovered in a perilous plight halfway up the steeple
of the South Church clinging to the lightningrod How he got there
nobody could tell not even bluejacket himself All he knew was that
the leg of his trousers had caught on a nail and there he stuck unable
to move either way It cost the town twenty dollars to get him down
again He directed the workmen how to splice the ladders brought to his
assistance and called his rescuers butterfingered landlubbers with
delicious coolness

But those were manofwars men The sedatelooking craft now lying off
Fishcrate Island wasnt likely to carry any such cargo Nevertheless we
watched the coming in of the longboat with considerable interest

As it drew near the figure of the man pulling the bowoar seemed oddly
familiar to me Where could I have seen him before When and where His
back was towards me but there was something about that closely cropped
head that I recognized instantly

Way enough cried the steersman and all the oars stood upright in
the air The man in the bow seized the boathook and turning round
quickly showed me the honest face of Sailor Ben of the Typhoon

Its Sailor Ben I cried nearly pushing Pepper Whitcomb overboard in
my excitement

Sailor Ben with the wonderful pink lady on his arm and the ships and
stars and anchors tattooed all over him was a wellknown hero among my
playmates And there he was like something in a dream come true

I didnt wait for my old acquaintance to get firmly on the wharf before
I grasped his hand in both of mine

Sailor Ben dont you remember me

He evidently did not He shifted his quid from one cheek to the other
and looked at me meditatively

Lord love ye lad I dont know you I was never here afore in my
life

What I cried enjoying his perplexity Have you forgotten the
voyage from New Orleans in the Typhoon two years ago you lovely old
picturebook

Ah then he knew me and in token of the recollection gave my hand such
a squeeze that I am sure an unpleasant change came over my countenance

Bless my eyes but you have growed so I shouldnt have knowed you if I
had met you in Singapore

Without stopping to inquire as I was tempted to do why he was more
likely to recognize me in Singapore than anywhere else I invited him to
come at once up to the Nutter House where I insured him a warm welcome
from the Captain

Hold steady Master Tom said Sailor Ben slipping the painter through
the ringbolt and tying the loveliest knot you ever saw hold steady
till I see if the mate can let me off If you please sir he
continued addressing the steersman a very redfaced bowlegged
person this here is a little shipmate o mine as wants to talk over
back times along of me if so its convenient

All right Ben returned the mate shant want you for an hour

Leaving one man in charge of the boat the mate and the rest of the
crew went off together In the meanwhile Pepper Whitcomb had got out his
cunnerline and was quietly fishing at the end of the wharf as if to
give me the idea that he wasnt so very much impressed by my intimacy
with so renowned a character as Sailor Ben Perhaps Pepper was a little
jealous At any rate he refused to go with us to the house

Captain Nutter was at home reading the Rivermouth Barnacle He was
a reader to do an editors heart good he never skipped over an
advertisement even if he had read it fifty times before Then the paper
went the rounds of the neighborhood among the poor people like the
single portable eye which the three blind crones passed to each other in
the legend of King Acrisius The Captain I repeat was wandering in
the labyrinths of the Rivermouth Barnacle when I led Sailor Ben into the
sittingroom

My grandfather whose inborn courtesy knew no distinctions received
my nautical friend as if he had been an admiral instead of a common
forecastlehand Sailor Ben pulled an imaginary tuft of hair on his
forehead and bowed clumsily Sailors have a way of using their forelock
as a sort of handle to bow with

The old tar had probably never been in so handsome an apartment in all
his days and nothing could induce him to take the inviting mahogany
chair which the Captain wheeled out from the corner

The abashed mariner stood up against the wall twirling his tarpaulin
in his two hands and looking extremely silly He made a poor show in a
gentlemans drawingroom but what a fellow he had been in his day when
the gale blew great guns and the topsails wanted reefing I thought of
him with the Mexican squadron off Vera Cruz where

The rushing battlebolt sung from the threedecker out of the foam

and he didnt seem awkward or ignoble to me for all his shyness

As Sailor Ben declined to sit down the Captain did not resume his seat
so we three stood in a constrained manner until my grandfather went to
the door and called to Kitty to bring in a decanter of Madeira and two
glasses

My grandson here has talked so much about you said the Captain
pleasantly that you seem quite like an old acquaintance to me

Thankee sir thankee returned Sailor Ben looking as guilty as if he
had been detected in picking a pocket

And Im very glad to see you MrMr

Sailor Ben suggested that worthy

Mr Sailor Ben added the Captain smiling Tom open the door
theres Kitty with the glasses

I opened the door and Kitty entered the room bringing the things on
a waiter which she was about to set on the table when suddenly she
uttered a loud shriek the decanter and glasses fell with a crash to the
floor and Kitty as white as a sheet was seen flying through the hall

Its his wraith Its his wraith we heard Kitty shrieking in the
kitchen

My grandfather and I turned with amazement to Sailor Ben His eyes were
standing out of his head like a lobsters

Its my own little Irish lass shouted the sailor and he darted into
the hall after her

Even then we scarcely caught the meaning of his words but when we saw
Sailor Ben and Kitty sobbing on each others shoulder in the kitchen we
understood it all

I begs your honors parden sir said Sailor Ben lifting his
tearstained face above Kittys tumbled hair I begs your honors
parden for kicking up a rumpus in the house but its my own little
Irish lass as I lost so long ago

Heaven preserve us cried the Captain blowing his nose violentlya
transparent ruse to hide his emotion

Miss Abigail was in an upper chamber sweeping but on hearing
the unusual racket below she scented an accident and came ambling
downstairs with a bottle of the infallible hotdrops in her hand
Nothing but the firmness of my grandfather prevented her from giving
Sailor Ben a tablespoonful on the spot But when she learned what had
come aboutthat this was Kittys husband that Kitty Collins wasnt
Kitty Collins now but Mrs Benjamin Watson of Nantucketthe good
soul sat down on the mealchest and sobbed as ifto quote from Captain
Nutteras if a husband of her own had turned up

A happier set of people than we were never met together in a dingy
kitchen or anywhere else The Captain ordered a fresh decanter of
Madeira and made all hands excepting myself drink a cup to the return
of the prodigal season as he persisted in calling Sailor Ben

After the first flush of joy and surprise was over Kitty grew silent
and constrained Now and then she fixed her eyes thoughtfully on her
husband Why had he deserted her all these years What right had he to
look for a welcome from one he had treated so cruelly She had been true
to him but had he been true to her Sailor Ben must have guessed what
was passing in her mind for presently he took her hand and saidWell
lass its a long yarn but you shall have it all in good time It was
my hard luck as made us part company an no will of mine for I loved
you dear

Kitty brightened up immediately needing no other assurance of Sailor
Bens faithfulness

When his hour had expired we walked with him down to the wharf where
the Captain held a consultation with the mate which resulted in an
extension of Mr Watsons leave of absence and afterwards in his
discharge from his ship We then went to the Mariners Home to engage
a room for him as he wouldnt hear of accepting the hospitalities of
the Nutter House

You see Im only an uneddicated man he remarked to my grandfather
by way of explanation




Chapter SixteenIn Which Sailor Ben Spins a Yarn


Of course we were all very curious to learn what had befallen Sailor
Ben that morning long ago when he bade his little bride goodby and
disappeared so mysteriously

After tea that same evening we assembled around the table in the
kitchenthe only place where Sailor Ben felt at hometo hear what he
had to say for himself

The candles were snuffed and a pitcher of foaming nutbrown ale was
set at the elbow of the speaker who was evidently embarrassed by the
respectability of his audience consisting of Captain Nutter Miss
Abigail myself and Kitty whose face shone with happiness like one of
the polished tin platters on the dresser

Well my hearties commenced Sailor Benthen he stopped short and
turned very red as it struck him that maybe this was not quite the
proper way to address a dignitary like the Captain and a severe elderly
lady like Miss Abigail Nutter who sat bolt upright staring at him as
she would have stared at the Tycoon of Japan himself

I aint much of a hand at spinnin a yarn remarked Sailor Ben
apologetically specially when the yarn is all about a man as has
made a fool of hisself an specially when that mans name is Benjamin
Watson

Bravo cried Captain Nutter rapping on the table encouragingly

Thankee sir thankee I go back to the time when Kitty an me was
livin in lodgins by the dock in New York We was as happy sir as two
porpusses which they toil not neither do they spin But when I seed the
money gittin low in the lockerKittys starboard stockin savin your
presence marmI got downhearted like seem as I should be obleeged
to ship agin for it didnt seem as I could do much ashore An then the
sea was my natral spear of action I wasnt exactly born on it look
you but I fell into it the fust time I was let out arter my birth My
mother slipped her cable for a heavenly port afore I was old enough to
hail her so I larnt to look on the ocean for a sort of stepmotheran
a precious hard one she has been to me

The idee of leavin Kitty so soon arter our marriage went agin my grain
considerable I cruised along the docks for somethin to do in the
way of stevedore an though I picked up a stray job here and there
I didnt arn enough to buy shipbisket for a rat let alone feedin two
human mouths There wasnt nothin honest I wouldnt have turned a hand
to but the longshoremen gobbled up all the work an a outsider like
me didnt stand a show

Things got from bad to worse the months rent took all our cash except
a dollar or so an the sky looked kind o squally fore an aft Well
I set out one morninthat identical unlucky mornindetermined to come
back an toss some pay into Kittys lap if I had to sell my jacket for
it I spied a brig unloadin coal at pier No 47how well I remembers
it I hailed the mate an offered myself for a coalheaver But I
wasnt wanted as he told me civilly enough which was better treatment
than usual As I turned off rather glum I was signalled by one of them
sleek smoothspoken rascals with a white hat an a weed on it as is
always goin about the piers aseekin who they may devower

We sailors know em for rascals from stem to starn but somehow every
fresh one fleeces us jest as his mate did afore him We dont larn
nothin by experence were jest no better than a lot of babys with no
brains

Good mornin my man sez the chap as iley as you please

Mornin sir sez I

Lookin for a job sez he

Through the big end of a telescope sez Imeanin that the chances
for a job looked very small from my pint of view

Youre the man for my money sez the sharper smilin as innocent as
a cherubim jest step in here till we talk it over

So I goes with him like a natralborn idiot into a little
groceryshop near by where we sets down at a table with a bottle atween
us Then it comes out as there is a New Bedford whaler about to start
for the fishin grounds an jest one ablebodied sailor like me is
wanted to make up the crew Would I go Yes I wouldnt on no terms

Ill bet you fifty dollars sez he that youll come back fust
mate

Ill bet you a hundred sez I that I dont for Ive signed papers
as keeps me ashore an the parson has witnessed the deed

So we sat there he urgin me to ship an I chaffin him cheerful over
the bottle

Arter a while I begun to feel a little queer things got foggy in my
upper works an I remembers faintlike of signin a paper then I
remembers bein in a small boat an then I remembers nothin until I
heard the mates whistle pipin all hands on deck I tumbled up with
the rest an there I wason board of a whaler outward bound for a three
years cruise an my dear little lass ashore awaitin for me

Miserable wretch said Miss Abigail in a voice that vibrated
among the tin platters on the dresser This was Miss Abigails way of
testifying her sympathy

Thankee marm returned Sailor Ben doubtfully

No talking to the man at the wheel cried the Captain Upon which we
all laughed Spin added my grandfather

Sailor Ben resumed

I leave you to guess the wretchedness as fell upon me for Ive not got
the gift to tell you There I was down on the ships books for a three
years viage an no help for it I feel nigh to six hundred years old
when I think how long that viage was There isnt no hourglass as runs
slow enough to keep a tally of the slowness of them fust hours But I
done my duty like a man seem there wasnt no way of gettin out of it
I told my shipmates of the trick as had been played on me an they tried
to cheer me up a bit but I was sore sorrowful for a long spell Many a
night on watch I put my face in my hands and sobbed for thinkin of the
little woman left among the landsharks an no man to have an eye on
her God bless her

Here Kitty softly drew her chair nearer to Sailor Ben and rested one
hand on his arm

Our adventures among the whales I take it doesnt consarn the present
company here assembled So I give that the go by Theres an end to
everythin even to a whalin viage My heart all but choked me the day
we put into New Bedford with our cargo of ile I got my three years pay
in a lump an made for New York like a flash of lightnin The people
hove to and looked at me as I rushed through the streets like a madman
until I came to the spot where the lodginhouse stood on West Street
But Lord love ye there wasnt no sech lodginhouse there but a great
new brick shop

I made bold to go in an ask arter the old place but nobody knowed
nothin about it save as it had been torn down two years or more I was
adrift now for I had reckoned all them days and nights on gittin word
of Kitty from Dan Shackford the man as kept the lodgin

As I stood there with all the wind knocked out of my sails the idee of
runnin alongside the perlicestation popped into my head The perlice
was likely to know the latitude of a man like Dan Shackford who wasnt
over an above respecktible They did knowhe had died in the Tombs jail
that day twelvemonth A coincydunce wasnt it I was ready to drop when
they told me this howsomever I bore up an give the chief a notion of
the fix I was in He writ a notice which I put into the newspapers every
day for three months but nothin come of it I cruised over the city
week in and week out I went to every sort of place where they hired
women hands I didnt leave a think undone that a uneddicated man could
do But nothin come of it I dont believe there was a wretcheder soul
in that big city of wretchedness than me Sometimes I wanted to lay down
in the sheets and die

Driftin disconsolate one day among the shippin who should I
overhaul but the identical smoothspoken chap with a white hat an a
weed on it I didnt know if there was any spent left in me till I
clapped eye on his very onpleasant countenance You villain sez
I wheres my little Irish lass as you dragged me away from an I
lighted on him hat and all like that

Here Sailor Ben brought his fist down on the deal table with the force
of a sledgehammer Miss Abigail gave a start and the ale leaped up in
the pitcher like a miniature fountain

I begs your parden ladies and gentlemen all but the thought of that
feller with his ring an his watchchain an his walrus face is alus
too many for me I was for pitchin him into the North River when a
perliceman prevented me from benefitin the human family I had to pay
five dollars for hittin the chap they said it was salt and buttery
an thats what I call a neat genteel luxury It was worth double the
money jest to see that white hat with a weed on it layin on the wharf
like a busted accordiun

Arter months of useless sarch I went to sea agin I never got into a
foren port but I kept a watch out for Kitty Once I thought I seed her
in Liverpool but it was only a gal as looked like her The numbers of
women in different parts of the world as looked like her was amazin So
a good many years crawled by an I wandered from place to place never
givin up the sarch I might have been chief mate scores of times maybe
master but I hadnt no ambition I seed many strange things in them
yearsoutlandish people an cities storms shipwracks an battles I
seed many a true mate go down an sometimes I envied them what went to
their rest But these things is neither here nor there

About a year ago I shipped on board the Belphoebe yonder an of all
the strange winds as ever blowed the strangest an the best was the
wind as blowed me to this here blessed spot I cant be too thankful
That Im as thankful as it is possible for an uneddicated man to be He
knows as reads the heart of all

Here ended Sailor Bens yarn which I have written down in his own
homely words as nearly as I can recall them After he had finished the
Captain shook hands with him and served out the ale

As Kitty was about to drink she paused rested the cup on her knee and
asked what day of the month it was

The twentyseventh said the Captain wondering what she was driving
at

Then cried Kitty its ten years this night sence

Since what asked my grandfather

Sence the little lass and I got spliced roared Sailor Ben Theres
another coincydunce for you

On hearing this we all clapped hands and the Captain with a degree
of ceremony that was almost painful drank a bumper to the health and
happiness of the bride and bridegroom

It was a pleasant sight to see the two old lovers sitting side by side
in spite of all drinking from the same little cupa battered zinc
dipper which Sailor Ben had unslung from a strap round his waist I
think I never saw him without this dipper and a sheathknife suspended
just back of his hip ready for any convivial occasion

We had a merry time of it The Captain was in great force this evening
and not only related his famous exploit in the War of 1812 but regaled
the company with a dashing seasong from Mr Shakespeares play of The
Tempest He had a mellow tenor voice not Shakespeare but the Captain
and rolled out the verse with a will

The master the swabber the boatswain and I
The gunner and his mate
Lovd Mall Meg and Marian and Margery
But none of us card for Kate

A very good song and very well sung says Sailor Ben but some of us
does care for Kate Is this Mr Shawkspear a seafarin man sir

Not at present replied the Captain with a monstrous twinkle in his
eye

The clock was striking ten when the party broke up The Captain walked
to the Mariners Home with his guest in order to question him
regarding his future movements

Well sir said he I aint as young as I was an I dont calulate
to go to sea no more I proposes to drop anchor here an hug the
land until the old hulk goes to pieces Ive got two or three thousand
dollars in the locker an expects to get on uncommon comfortable
without askin no odds from the Assylum for Decayed Mariners

My grandfather indorsed the plan warmly and Sailor Ben did drop anchor
in Rivermouth where he speedily became one of the institutions of the
town

His first step was to buy a small onestory cottage located at the
head of the wharf within gunshot of the Nutter House To the great
amusement of my grandfather Sailor Ben painted the cottage a light
skyblue and ran a broad black stripe around it just under the eaves
In this stripe he painted white portholes at regular distances making
his residence look as much like a manofwar as possible With a short
flagstaff projecting over the door like a bowsprit the effect was
quite magical My description of the exterior of this palatial residence
is complete when I add that the proprietor nailed a horseshoe against
the front door to keep off the witchesa very necessary precaution in
these latitudes

The inside of Sailor Bens abode was not less striking than the outside
The cottage contained two rooms the one opening on the wharf he
called his cabin here he ate and slept His few tumblers and a frugal
collection of crockery were set in a rack suspended over the table
which had a cleat of wood nailed round the edge to prevent the dishes
from sliding off in case of a heavy sea Hanging against the walls
were three or four highly colored prints of celebrated frigates and
a lithograph picture of a rosy young woman insufficiently clad in the
American flag This was labelled Kitty though Im sure it looked no
more like her than I did A walrustooth with an Esquimaux engraved on
it a sharks jaw and the blade of a swordfish were among the enviable
decorations of this apartment In one corner stood his bunk or bed
and in the other his wellworn seachest a perfect Pandoras box of
mysteries You would have thought yourself in the cabin of a real ship

The little room aft separated from the cabin by a sliding door was the
caboose It held a cookingstove pots pans and groceries also a lot
of fishinglines and coils of tarred twine which made the place smell
like a forecastle and a delightful smell it isto those who fancy it

Kitty didnt leave our service but played housekeeper for both
establishments returning at night to Sailor Bens He shortly added
a wherry to his worldly goods and in the fishing season made a very
handsome income During the winter he employed himself manufacturing
crabnets for which he found no lack of customers

His popularity among the boys was immense A jackknife in his expert
hand was a whole chest of tools He could whittle out anything from a
wooden chain to a Chinese pagoda or a fullrigged seventyfour a foot
long To own a ship of Sailor Bens building was to be exalted above
your fellowcreatures He didnt carve many and those he refused to
sell choosing to present them to his young friends of whom Tom Bailey
you may be sure was one

How delightful it was of winter nights to sit in his cosey cabin close
to the ships stove he wouldnt hear of having a fireplace and listen
to Sailor Bens yarns In the early summer twilights when he sat on
the doorstep splicing a rope or mending a net he always had a bevy of
blooming young faces alongside

The dear old fellow How tenderly the years touched him after thisall
the more tenderly it seemed for having roughed him so cruelly in other
days




Chapter SeventeenHow We Astonished the Rivermouthians


Sailor Bens arrival partly drove the New Orleans project from my brain
Besides there was just then a certain movement on foot by the Centipede
Club which helped to engross my attention

Pepper Whitcomb took the Captains veto philosophically observing that
he thought from the first the governor wouldnt let me go I dont think
Pepper was quite honest in that

But to the subject in hand

Among the few changes that have taken place in Rivermouth during the
past twenty years there is one which I regret I lament the removal of
all those varnished iron cannon which used to do duty as posts at
the corners of streets leading from the river They were quaintly
ornamental each set upon end with a solid shot soldered into its mouth
and gave to that part of the town a picturesqueness very poorly atoned
for by the conventional wooden stakes that have deposed them

These guns old sogers the boys called them had their story like
everything else in Rivermouth When that everlasting last warthe War of
1812 I meancame to an end all the brigs schooners and barks fitted
out at this port as privateers were as eager to get rid of their useless
twelvepounders and swivels as they had previously been to obtain them
Many of the pieces had cost large sums and now they were little better
than so much crude ironnot so good in fact for they were clumsy
things to break up and melt over The government didnt want them
private citizens didnt want them they were a drug in the market

But there was one man ridiculous beyond his generation who got it into
his head that a fortune was to be made out of these same guns To buy
them all to hold on to them until war was declared again as he had
no doubt it would be in a few months and then sell out at fabulous
pricesthis was the daring idea that addled the pate of Silas Trefethen
Dealer in E  W I Goods and Groceries as the faded sign over his
shopdoor informed the public

Silas went shrewdly to work buying up every old cannon he could lay
hands on His backyard was soon crowded with brokendown guncarriages
and his barn with guns like an arsenal When Silass purpose got wind
it was astonishing how valuable that thing became which just now was
worth nothing at all

Ha ha thought Silas Somebody else is tryin hi git control of the
market But I guess Ive got the start of him

So he went on buying and buying oftentimes paying double the original
price of the article People in the neighboring towns collected all
the worthless ordnance they could find and sent it by the cartload to
Rivermouth

When his barn was full Silas began piling the rubbish in his cellar
then in his parlor He mortgaged the stock of his grocery store
mortgaged his house his barn his horse and would have mortgaged
himself if anyone would have taken him as security in order to carry
on the grand speculation He was a ruined man and as happy as a lark

Surely poor Silas was cracked like the majority of his own cannon More
or less crazy he must have been always Years before this he purchased
an elegant rosewood coffin and kept it in one of the spare rooms in his
residence He even had his name engraved on the silverplate leaving a
blank after the word Died

The blank was filled up in due time and well it was for Silas that he
secured so stylish a coffin in his opulent days for when he died his
worldly wealth would not have bought him a pine box to say nothing of
rosewood He never gave up expecting a war with Great Britain Hopeful
and radiant to the last his dying words were Englandwarfew
daysgreat profits

It was that sweet old lady Dame Jocelyn who told me the story of Silas
Trefethen for these things happened long before my day Silas died in
1817

At Trefethens death his unique collection came under the auctioneers
hammer Some of the larger guns were sold to the town and planted at
the corners of divers streets others went off to the ironfoundry the
balance numbering twelve were dumped down on a deserted wharf at the
foot of Anchor Lane where summer after summer they rested at their
ease in the grass and fungi pelted in autumn by the rain and annually
buried by the winter snow It is with these twelve guns that our story
has to deal

The wharf where they reposed was shut off from the street by a high
fencea silent dreamy old wharf covered with strange weeds and mosses
On account of its seclusion and the good fishing it afforded it was
much frequented by us boys

There we met many an afternoon to throw out our lines or play
leapfrog among the rusty cannon They were famous fellows in our eyes
What a racket they had made in the heyday of their unchastened youth
What stories they might tell now if their puffy metallic lips could
only speak Once they were lively talkers enough but there the grim
seadogs lay silent and forlorn in spite of all their former growlings

They always seemed to me like a lot of venerable disabled tars
stretched out on a lawn in front of a hospital gazing seaward and
mutely lamenting their lost youth

But once more they were destined to lift up their dolorous voicesonce
more ere they keeled over and lay speechless for all time And this is
how it befell

Jack Harris Charley Marden Harry Blake and myself were fishing
off the wharf one afternoon when a thought flashed upon me like an
inspiration

I say boys I cried hauling in my line hand over hand Ive got
something

What does it pull like youngster asked Harris looking down at the
taut line and expecting to see a big perch at least

O nothing in the fish way I returned laughing its about the old
guns

What about them

I was thinking what jolly fun it would be to set one of the old sogers
on his legs and serve him out a ration of gunpowder

Up came the three lines in a jiffy An enterprise better suited to the
disposition of my companions could not have been proposed

In a short time we had one of the smaller cannon over on its back and
were busy scraping the green rust from the touchhole The mould had
spiked the gun so effectually that for a while we fancied we should
have to give up our attempt to resuscitate the old soger

A long gimlet would clear it out said Charley Marden if we only had
one

I looked to see if Sailor Bens flag was flying at the cabin door for
he always took in the colors when he went off fishing

When you want to know if the Admirals aboard jest cast an eye to the
buntin my hearties says Sailor Ben

Sometimes in a jocose mood he called himself the Admiral and I am
sure he deserved to be one The Admirals flag was flying and I soon
procured a gimlet from his carefully kept toolchest

Before long we had the gun in working order A newspaper lashed to the
end of a lath served as a swab to dust out the bore Jack Harris blew
through the touchhole and pronounced all clear

Seeing our task accomplished so easily we turned our attention to
the other guns which lay in all sorts of postures in the rank grass
Borrowing a rope from Sailor Ben we managed with immense labor to drag
the heavy pieces into position and place a brick under each muzzle to
give it the proper elevation When we beheld them all in a row like a
regular battery we simultaneously conceived an idea the magnitude of
which struck us dumb for a moment

Our first intention was to load and fire a single gun How feeble and
insignificant was such a plan compared to that which now sent the light
dancing into our eyes

What could we have been thinking of cried Jack Harris Well give
em a broadside to be sure if we die for it

We turned to with a will and before nightfall had nearly half the
battery overhauled and ready for service To keep the artillery dry we
stuffed wads of loose hemp into the muzzles and fitted wooden pegs to
the touchholes

At recess the next noon the Centipedes met in a corner of the
schoolyard to talk over the proposed lark The original projectors
though they would have liked to keep the thing secret were obliged
to make a club matter of it inasmuch as funds were required for
ammunition There had been no recent drain on the treasury and the
society could well afford to spend a few dollars in so notable an
undertaking

It was unanimously agreed that the plan should be carried out in the
handsomest manner and a subscription to that end was taken on the spot
Several of the Centipedes hadnt a cent excepting the one strung around
their necks others however were richer I chanced to have a dollar
and it went into the cap quicker than lightning When the club in view
of my munificence voted to name the guns Baileys Battery I was prouder
than I have ever been since over anything

The money thus raised added to that already in the treasury amounted
to nine dollarsa fortune in those days but not more than we had use
for This sum was divided into twelve parts for it would not do for one
boy to buy all the powder nor even for us all to make our purchases at
the same place That would excite suspicion at any time particularly at
a period so remote from the Fourth of July

There were only three stores in town licensed to sell powder that gave
each store four customers Not to run the slightest risk of remark
one boy bought his powder on Monday the next boy on Tuesday and so on
until the requisite quantity was in our possession This we put into a
keg and carefully hid in a dry spot on the wharf

Our next step was to finish cleaning the guns which occupied two
afternoons for several of the old sogers were in a very congested state
indeed Having completed the task we came upon a difficulty To set
off the battery by daylight was out of the question it must be done at
night it must be done with fuses for no doubt the neighbors would
turn out after the first two or three shots and it would not pay to be
caught in the vicinity

Who knew anything about fuses Who could arrange it so the guns would go
off one after the other with an interval of a minute or so between

Theoretically we knew that a minute fuse lasted a minute double the
quantity two minutes but practically we were at a standstill There
was but one person who could help us in this extremitySailor Ben To
me was assigned the duty of obtaining what information I could from the
exgunner it being left to my discretion whether or not to intrust him
with our secret

So one evening I dropped into the cabin and artfully turned the
conversation to fuses in general and then to particular fuses but
without getting much out of the old boy who was busy making a twine
hammock Finally I was forced to divulge the whole plot

The Admiral had a sailors love for a joke and entered at once and
heartily into our scheme He volunteered to prepare the fuses himself
and I left the labor in his hands having bound him by several
extraordinary oathssuch as HopeImaydie and Shivermytimbersnot
to betray us come what would

This was Monday evening On Wednesday the fuses were ready That night
we were to unmuzzle Baileys Battery Mr Grimshaw saw that something
was wrong somewhere for we were restless and absentminded in the
classes and the best of us came to grief before the morning session was
over When Mr Grimshaw announced Guy Fawkes as the subject for our
next composition you might have knocked down the Mystic Twelve with a
feather

The coincidence was certainly curious but when a man has committed
or is about to commit an offence a hundred trifles which would pass
unnoticed at another time seem to point at him with convicting fingers
No doubt Guy Fawkes himself received many a start after he had got his
wicked kegs of gunpowder neatly piled up under the House of Lords

Wednesday as I have mentioned was a halfholiday and the Centipedes
assembled in my barn to decide on the final arrangements These were
as simple as could be As the fuses were connected it needed but one
person to fire the train Hereupon arose a discussion as to who was the
proper person Some argued that I ought to apply the match the battery
being christened after me and the main idea moreover being mine
Others advocated the claim of Phil Adams as the oldest boy At last we
drew lots for the post of honor

Twelve slips of folded paper upon one of which was written Thou art
the man were placed in a quart measure and thoroughly shaken then
each member stepped up and lifted out his destiny At a given signal we
opened our billets Thou art the man said the slip of paper trembling
in my fingers The sweets and anxieties of a leader were mine the rest
of the afternoon

Directly after twilight set in Phil Adams stole down to the wharf and
fixed the fuses to the guns laying a train of powder from the principal
fuse to the fence through a chink of which I was to drop the match at
midnight

At ten oclock Rivermouth goes to bed At eleven oclock Rivermouth is
as quiet as a country churchyard At twelve oclock there is nothing
left with which to compare the stillness that broods over the little
seaport

In the midst of this stillness I arose and glided out of the house like
a phantom bent on an evil errand like a phantom I flitted through the
silent street hardly drawing breath until I knelt down beside the fence
at the appointed place

Pausing a moment for my heart to stop thumping I lighted the match
and shielded it with both hands until it was well under way and then
dropped the blazing splinter on the slender thread of gunpowder

A noiseless flash instantly followed and all was dark again I peeped
through the crevice in the fence and saw the main fuse spitting out
sparks like a conjurer Assured that the train had not failed I took
to my heels fearful lest the fuse might burn more rapidly than we
calculated and cause an explosion before I could get home This
luckily did not happen Theres a special Providence that watches over
idiots drunken men and boys

I dodged the ceremony of undressing by plunging into bed jacket boots
and all I am not sure I took off my cap but I know that I had hardly
pulled the coverlid over me when BOOM sounded the first gun of
Baileys Battery

I lay as still as a mouse In less than two minutes there was another
burst of thunder and then another The third gun was a tremendous
fellow and fairly shook the house

The town was waking up Windows were thrown open here and there and
people called to each other across the streets asking what that firing
was for

BOOM went gun number four

I sprung out of bed and tore off my jacket for I heard the Captain
feeling his way along the wall to my chamber I was half undressed by
the time he found the knob of the door

I say sir I cried do you hear those guns

Not being deaf I do said the Captain a little tartlyany reflection
on his hearing always nettled him but what on earth they are for I
cant conceive You had better get up and dress yourself

Im nearly dressed sir

BOOM BOOMtwo of the guns had gone off together

The door of Miss Abigails bedroom opened hastily and that pink of
maidenly propriety stepped out into the hail in her nightgownthe only
indecorous thing I ever knew her to do She held a lighted candle in her
hand and looked like a very aged Lady Macbeth

O Danel this is dreadful What do you suppose it means

I really cant suppose said the Captain rubbing his ear but I
guess its over now

BOOM said Baileys Battery

Rivermouth was wide awake now and half the male population were in the
streets running different ways for the firing seemed to proceed from
opposite points of the town Everybody waylaid everybody else with
questions but as no one knew what was the occasion of the tumult
people who were not usually nervous began to be oppressed by the
mystery

Some thought the town was being bombarded some thought the world was
coming to an end as the pious and ingenious Mr Miller had predicted
it would but those who couldnt form any theory whatever were the most
perplexed

In the meanwhile Baileys Battery bellowed away at regular intervals
The greatest confusion reigned everywhere by this time People with
lanterns rushed hither and thither The town watch had turned out to
a man and marched off in admirable order in the wrong direction
Discovering their mistake they retraced their steps and got down to
the wharf just as the last cannon belched forth its lightning

A dense cloud of sulphurous smoke floated over Anchor Lane obscuring
the starlight Two or three hundred people in various stages of
excitement crowded about the upper end of the wharf not liking to
advance farther until they were satisfied that the explosions were
over A board was here and there blown from the fence and through
the openings thus afforded a few of the more daring spirits at length
ventured to crawl

The cause of the racket soon transpired A suspicion that they had
been sold gradually dawned on the Rivermouthians Many were exceedingly
indignant and declared that no penalty was severe enough for those
concerned in such a prank othersand these were the very people who
had been terrified nearly out of their witshad the assurance to laugh
saying that they knew all along it was only a trick

The town watch boldly took possession of the ground and the crowd began
to disperse Knots of gossips lingered here and there near the place
indulging in vain surmises as to who the invisible gunners could be

There was no more noise that night but many a timid person lay awake
expecting a renewal of the mysterious cannonading The Oldest Inhabitant
refused to go to bed on any terms but persisted in sitting up in a
rockingchair with his hat and mittens on until daybreak

I thought I should never get to sleep The moment I drifted off in a
doze I fell to laughing and woke myself up But towards morning slumber
overtook me and I had a series of disagreeable dreams in one of which
I was waited upon by the ghost of Silas Trefethen with an exorbitant
bill for the use of his guns In another I was dragged before a
courtmartial and sentenced by Sailor Ben in a frizzled wig and
threecornered cocked hat to be shot to death by Baileys Batterya
sentence which Sailor Ben was about to execute with his own hand when
I suddenly opened my eyes and found the sunshine lying pleasantly across
my face I tell you I was glad

That unaccountable fascination which leads the guilty to hover about the
spot where his crime was committed drew me down to the wharf as soon as
I was dressed Phil Adams Jack Harris and others of the conspirators
were already there examining with a mingled feeling of curiosity and
apprehension the havoc accomplished by the battery

The fence was badly shattered and the ground ploughed up for several
yards round the place where the guns formerly layformerly lay for
now they were scattered every which way There was scarcely a gun that
hadnt burst Here was one ripped open from muzzle to breech and there
was another with its mouth blown into the shape of a trumpet Three of
the guns had disappeared bodily but on looking over the edge of the
wharf we saw them standing on end in the tidemud They had popped
overboard in their excitement

I tell you what fellows whispered Phil Adams it is lucky we didnt
try to touch em off with punk Theyd have blown us all to flinders

The destruction of Baileys Battery was not unfortunately the only
catastrophe A fragment of one of the cannon had earned away the chimney
of Sailor Bens cabin He was very mad at first but having prepared the
fuse himself he didnt dare complain openly

Id have taken a reef in the blessed stovepipe said the Admiral
gazing ruefully at the smashed chimney if I had known as how the
Flagship was agoin to be under fire

The next day he rigged out an iron funnel which being in sections
could be detached and taken in at a moments notice On the whole
I think he was resigned to the demolition of his brick chimney The
stovepipe was a great deal more shipshape

The town was not so easily appeased The selectmen determined to make
an example of the guilty parties and offered a reward for their arrest
holding out a promise of pardon to anyone of the offenders who would
furnish information against the rest But there were no faint hearts
among the Centipedes Suspicion rested for a while on several personson
the soldiers at the fort on a crazy fellow known about town as
BottleNose and at last on Sailor Ben

Shiver my timbers cries that deeply injured individual Do you
suppose sir as I have lived to sixty year an aint got no more sense
than to go for to blaze away at my own upper riggin It doesnt stand
to reason

It certainly did not seem probable that Mr Watson would maliciously
knock over his own chimney and Lawyer Hackett who had the case in
hand bowed himself out of the Admirals cabin convinced that the right
man had not been discovered

People living by the sea are always more or less superstitious Stories
of spectre ships and mysterious beacons that lure vessels out of their
course and wreck them on unknown reefs were among the stock legends of
Rivermouth and not a few people in the town were ready to attribute the
firing of those guns to some supernatural agency The Oldest Inhabitant
remembered that when he was a boy a dimlooking sort of schooner hove
to in the offing one foggy afternoon fired off a single gun that didnt
make any report and then crumbled to nothing spar mast and hulk
like a piece of burnt paper

The authorities however were of the opinion that human hands had
something to do with the explosions and they resorted to deeplaid
stratagems to get hold of the said hands One of their traps came very
near catching us They artfully caused an old brass fieldpiece to be
left on a wharf near the scene of our late operations Nothing in the
world but the lack of money to buy powder saved us from falling into
the clutches of the two watchmen who lay secreted for a week in a
neighboring sailloft

It was many a day before the midnight bombardment ceased to be the
towntalk The trick was so audacious and on so grand a scale that
nobody thought for an instant of connecting us lads with it
Suspicion at length grew weary of lighting on the wrong person and
as conjecturelike the physicians in the epitaphwas in vain the
Rivermouthians gave up the idea of finding out who had astonished them

They never did find out and never will unless they read this veracious
history If the selectmen are still disposed to punish the malefactors
I can supply Lawyer Hackett with evidence enough to convict Pepper
Whitcomb Phil Adams Charley Marden and the other honorable members of
the Centipede Club But really I dont think it would pay now




Chapter EighteenA Frog He Would AWooing Go


If the reader supposes that I lived all this while in Rivermouth without
falling a victim to one or more of the young ladies attending Miss
Dorothy Gibbss Female Institute why then all I have to say is the
reader exhibits his ignorance of human nature

Miss Gibbss seminary was located within a few minutes walk of the
Temple Grammar School and numbered about thirtyfive pupils the
majority of whom boarded at the HallPrimrose Hall as Miss Dorothy
prettily called it The Primroses as we called them ranged from
seven years of age to sweet seventeen and a prettier group of sirens
never got together even in Rivermouth for Rivermouth you should know
is famous for its pretty girls

There were tall girls and short girls rosy girls and pale girls and
girls as brown as berries girls like Amazons slender girls weird
and winning like Undine girls with black tresses girls with auburn
ringlets girls with every tinge of golden hair To behold Miss
Dorothys young ladies of a Sunday morning walking to church two by two
the smallest toddling at the end of the procession like the bobs at the
tail of a kite was a spectacle to fill with tender emotion the least
susceptible heart To see Miss Dorothy marching grimly at the head of
her light infantry was to feel the hopelessness of making an attack on
any part of the column

She was a perfect dragon of watchfulness The most unguarded lifting of
an eyelash in the fluttering battalion was sufficient to put her on the
lookout She had had experiences with the male sex this Miss Dorothy
so prim and grim It was whispered that her heart was a tattered album
scrawled over with lovelines but that she had shut up the volume long
ago

There was a tradition that she had been crossed in love but it was the
faintest of traditions A gay young lieutenant of marines had flirted
with her at a country ball AD 1811 and then marched carelessly away
at the head of his company to the shrill music of the fife without so
much as a sigh for the girl he left behind him The years rolled on the
gallant gay Lothariowhich wasnt his namemarried became a father
and then a grandfather and at the period of which I am speaking his
grandchild was actually one of Miss Dorothys young ladies So at
least ran the story

The lieutenant himself was dead these many years but Miss Dorothy never
got over his duplicity She was convinced that the sole aim of mankind
was to win the unguarded affection of maidens and then march off
treacherously with flying colors to the heartless music of the drum and
fife To shield the inmates of Primrose Hall from the bitter influences
that had blighted her own early affections was Miss Dorothys mission in
life

No wolves prowling about my lambs if you please said

Miss Dorothy I will not allow it

She was as good as her word I dont think the boy lives who ever set
foot within the limits of Primrose Hall while the seminary was under her
charge Perhaps if Miss Dorothy had given her young ladies a little more
liberty they would not have thought it such fun to make eyes over the
white lattice fence at the young gentlemen of the Temple Grammar School
I say perhaps for it is one thing to manage thirtyfive young ladies
and quite another thing to talk about it

But all Miss Dorothys vigilance could not prevent the young folks
from meeting in the town now and then nor could her utmost ingenuity
interrupt postal arrangements There was no end of notes passing between
the students and the Primroses Notes tied to the heads of arrows were
shot into dormitory windows notes were tucked under fences and hidden
in the trunks of decayed trees Every thick place in the boxwood hedge
that surrounded the seminary was a possible postoffice

It was a terrible shock to Miss Dorothy the day she unearthed a nest of
letters in one of the huge wooden urns surmounting the gateway that led
to her dovecot It was a bitter moment to Miss Phoebe and Miss Candace
and Miss Hesba when they had their locks of hair grimly handed back
to them by Miss Gibbs in the presence of the whole school Girls whose
locks of hair had run the blockade in safety were particularly severe on
the offenders But it didnt stop other notes and other tresses and I
would like to know what can stop them while the earth holds together

Now when I first came to Rivermouth I looked upon girls as rather tame
company I hadnt a spark of sentiment concerning them but seeing my
comrades sending and receiving mysterious epistles wearing bits of
ribbon in their buttonholes and leaving packages of confectionery
generally lemondrops in the hollow trunks of treeswhy I felt that
this was the proper thing to do I resolved as a matter of duty to
fall in love with somebody and I didnt care in the least who it was
In much the same mood that Don Quixote selected the Dulcinea del Toboso
for his ladylove I singled out one of Miss Dorothys incomparable
young ladies for mine

I debated a long while whether I should not select two but at last
settled down on onea pale little girl with blue eyes named Alice I
shall not make a long story of this for Alice made short work of
me She was secretly in love with Pepper Whitcomb This occasioned a
temporary coolness between Pepper and myself

Not disheartened however I placed Laura RiceI believe it was Laura
Ricein the vacant niche The new idol was more cruel than the old
The former frankly sent me to the right about but the latter was a
deceitful lot She wore my nosegay in her dress at the evening service
the Primroses were marched to church three times every Sunday she
penned me the daintiest of notes she sent me the glossiest of ringlets
cut as I afterwards found out from the stupid head of Miss Gibbss
chambermaid and at the same time was holding me and my pony up to
ridicule in a series of letters written to Jack Harris It was Harris
himself who kindly opened my eyes

I tell you what Bailey said that young gentleman Laura is an old
veteran and carries too many guns for a youngster She cant resist a
flirtation I believe shed flirt with an infant in arms Theres hardly
a fellow in the school that hasnt worn her colors and some of her hair
She doesnt give out any more of her own hair now Its been pretty well
used up The demand was greater than the supply you see Its all very
well to correspond with Laura but as to looking for anything serious
from her the knowing ones dont Hope I havent hurt your feelings
old boy that was a soothing stroke of flattery to call me old boy
but it was my duty as a friend and a Centipede to let you know who you
were dealing with

Such was the advice given me by that timestricken careworn and
embittered man of the world who was sixteen years old if he was a day

I dropped Laura In the course of the next twelve months I had perhaps
three or four similar experiences and the conclusion was forced upon
me that I was not a boy likely to distinguish myself in this branch of
business

I fought shy of Primrose Hall from that moment Smiles were smiled over
the boxwood hedge and little hands were occasionally kissed to me
but I only winked my eye patronizingly and passed on I never renewed
tender relations with Miss Gibbss young ladies All this occurred
during my first year and a half at Rivermouth

Between my studies at school my outdoor recreations and the hurts my
vanity received I managed to escape for the time being any very serious
attack of that love fever which like the measles is almost certain to
seize upon a boy sooner or later I was not to be an exception I was
merely biding my time The incidents I have now to relate took place
shortly after the events described in the last chapter


In a life so tranquil and circumscribed as ours in the Nutter House a
visitor was a novelty of no little importance The whole household awoke
from its quietude one morning when the Captain announced that a young
niece of his from New York was to spend a few weeks with us

The bluechintz room into which a ray of sun was never allowed to
penetrate was thrown open and dusted and its mouldy air made sweet
with a bouquet of potroses placed on the oldfashioned bureau Kitty
was busy all the forenoon washing off the sidewalk and sandpapering the
great brass knocker on our frontdoor and Miss Abigail was up to her
elbows in a pigeonpie

I felt sure it was for no ordinary person that all these preparations
were in progress and I was right Miss Nelly Glentworth was no ordinary
person I shall never believe she was There may have been lovelier
women though I have never seen them there may have been more brilliant
women though it has not been my fortune to meet them but that there
was ever a more charming one than Nelly Glentworth is a proposition
against which I contend

I dont love her now I dont think of her once in five years and
yet it would give me a turn if in the course of my daily walk I should
suddenly come upon her eldest boy I may say that her eldest boy was
not playing a prominent part in this life when I first made her
acquaintance

It was a drizzling cheerless afternoon towards the end of summer that
a hack drew up at the door of the Nutter House The Captain and Miss
Abigail hastened into the hall on hearing the carriage stop In a moment
more Miss Nelly Glentworth was seated in our sittingroom undergoing
a critical examination at the hands of a small boy who lounged
uncomfortably on a settee between the windows

The small boy considered himself a judge of girls and he rapidly came
to the following conclusions That Miss Nelly was about nineteen that
she had not given away much of her back hair which hung in two massive
chestnut braids over her shoulders that she was a shade too pale and a
trifle too tall that her hands were nicely shaped and her feet much
too diminutive for daily use He furthermore observed that her voice was
musical and that her face lighted up with an indescribable brightness
when she smiled

On the whole the small boy liked her well enough and satisfied that
she was not a person to be afraid of but on the contrary one who
might be made quite agreeable he departed to keep an appointment with
his friend Sir Pepper Whitcomb

But the next morning when Miss Glentworth came down to breakfast in a
purple dress her face as fresh as one of the mossroses on the bureau
upstairs and her laugh as contagious as the merriment of a robin the
small boy experienced a strange sensation and mentally compared her
with the loveliest of Miss Gibbss young ladies and found those young
ladies wanting in the balance

A nights rest had wrought a wonderful change in Miss Nelly The pallor
and weariness of the journey had passed away I looked at her through
the toastrack and thought I had never seen anything more winning than
her smile

After breakfast she went out with me to the stable to see Gypsy and the
three of us became friends then and there Nelly was the only girl that
Gypsy ever took the slightest notice of

It chanced to be a halfholiday and a baseball match of unusual
interest was to come off on the school ground that afternoon but
somehow I didnt go I hung about the house abstractedly The Captain
went up town and Miss Abigail was busy in the kitchen making immortal
gingerbread I drifted into the sittingroom and had our guest all to
myself for I dont know how many hours It was twilight I recollect
when the Captain returned with letters for Miss Nelly

Many a time after that I sat with her through the dreamy September
afternoons If I had played baseball it would have been much better for
me

Those first days of Miss Nellys visit are very misty in my remembrance
I try in vain to remember just when I began to fall in love with her
Whether the spell worked upon me gradually or fell upon me all at once
I dont know I only know that it seemed to me as if I had always loved
her Things that took place before she came were dim to me like events
that had occurred in the Middle Ages

Nelly was at least five years my senior But what of that Adam is the
only man I ever heard of who didnt in early youth fall in love with a
woman older than himself and I am convinced that he would have done so
if he had had the opportunity

I wonder if girls from fifteen to twenty are aware of the glamour they
cast over the straggling awkward boys whom they regard and treat as
mere children I wonder now Young women are so keen in such matters
I wonder if Miss Nelly Glentworth never suspected until the very last
night of her visit at Rivermouth that I was over ears in love with her
pretty self and was suffering pangs as poignant as if I had been
ten feet high and as old as Methuselah For indeed I was miserable
throughout all those five weeks I went down in the Latin class at the
rate of three boys a day Her fresh young eyes came between me and my
book and there was an end of Virgil

 O love love love
 Love is like a dizziness
 It winna let a body
 Gang aboot his business

I was wretched away from her and only less wretched in her presence
The special cause of my woe was this I was simply a little boy to Miss
Glentworth I knew it I bewailed it I ground my teeth and wept in
secret over the fact If I had been aught else in her eyes would she
have smoothed my hair so carelessly sending an electric shock through
my whole system Would she have walked with me hand in hand for hours
in the old garden and once when I lay on the sofa my head aching with
love and mortification would she have stooped down and kissed me if I
hadnt been a little boy How I despised little boys How I hated one
particular little boytoo little to be loved

I smile over this very grimly even now My sorrow was genuine and
bitter It is a great mistake on the part of elderly people male and
female to tell a child that he is seeing his happiest days Dont you
believe a word of it my little friend The burdens of childhood are as
hard to bear as the crosses that weigh us down later in life while the
happinesses of childhood are tame compared with those of our maturer
years And even if this were not so it is rank cruelty to throw shadows
over the young heart by croaking Be merry for tomorrow you die

As the last days of Nellys visit drew near I fell into a very
unhealthy state of mind To have her so frank and unconsciously
coquettish with me was a daily torment to be looked upon and treated as
a child was bitter almonds but the thought of losing her altogether was
distraction

The summer was at an end The days were perceptibly shorter and now and
then came an evening when it was chilly enough to have a woodfire in
our sittingroom The leaves were beginning to take hectic tints and
the wind was practising the minor pathetic notes of its autumnal
dirge Nature and myself appeared to be approaching our dissolution
simultaneously

One evening the evening previous to the day set for Nellys
departurehow well I remember itI found her sitting alone by the wide
chimneypiece looking musingly at the crackling back log There were
no candles in the room On her face and hands and on the small golden
cross at her throat fell the flickering firelightthat ruddy mellow
firelight in which ones grandmother would look poetical

I drew a low stool from the corner and placed it by the side of her
chair She reached out her hand to me as was her pretty fashion and so
we sat for several moments silently in the changing glow of the burning
logs At length I moved back the stool so that I could see her face in
profile without being seen by her I lost her hand by this movement but
I couldnt have spoken with the listless touch of her fingers on mine
After two or three attempts I said Nelly a good deal louder than I
intended

Perhaps the effort it cost me was evident in my voice She raised
herself quickly in the chair and half turned towards me

Well Tom

II am very sorry you are going away

So am I I have enjoyed every hour of my visit

Do you think you will ever come back here

Perhaps said Nelly and her eyes wandered off into the fitful
firelight

I suppose you will forget us all very quickly

Indeed I shall not I shall always have the pleasantest memories of
Rivermouth

Here the conversation died a natural death Nelly sank into a sort of
dream and I meditated Fearing every moment to be interrupted by some
member of the family I nerved myself to make a bold dash

Nelly

Well

Do you I hesitated

Do I what

Love anyone very much

Why of course I do said Nelly scattering her revery with a merry
laugh I love Uncle Nutter and Aunt Nutter and youand Towser

Towser our new dog I couldnt stand that I pushed back the stool
impatiently and stood in front of her

Thats not what I mean I said angrily

Well what do you mean

Do you love anyone to marry him

The idea of it cried Nelly laughing

But you must tell me

Must Tom

Indeed you must Nelly

She had risen from the chair with an amused perplexed look in her eyes
I held her an instant by the dress

Please tell me

O you silly boy cried Nelly Then she rumpled my hair all over my
forehead and ran laughing out of the room

Suppose Cinderella had rumpled the princes hair all over his forehead
how would he have liked it Suppose the Sleeping Beauty when the kings
son with a kiss set her and all the old clocks agoing in the spellbound
castlesuppose the young minx had looked up and coolly laughed in his
eye I guess the kings son wouldnt have been greatly pleased

I hesitated a second or two and then rushed after Nelly just in time to
run against Miss Abigail who entered the room with a couple of lighted
candles

Goodness gracious Tom exclaimed Miss Abigail Are you possessed

I left her scraping the warm spermaceti from one of her thumbs

Nelly was in the kitchen talking quite unconcernedly with Kitty Collins
There she remained until suppertime Supper over we all adjourned to
the sittingroom I planned and plotted but could manage in no way to
get Nelly alone She and the Captain played cribbage all the evening

The next morning my lady did not make her appearance until we were
seated at the breakfasttable I had got up at daylight myself
Immediately after breakfast the carriage arrived to take her to the
railway station A gentleman stepped from this carriage and greatly to
my surprise was warmly welcomed by the Captain and Miss Abigail and by
Miss Nelly herself who seemed unnecessarily glad to see him From the
hasty conversation that followed I learned that the gentleman had come
somewhat unexpectedly to conduct Miss Nelly to Boston But how did he
know that she was to leave that morning Nelly bade farewell to the
Captain and Miss Abigail made a little rush and kissed me on the nose
and was gone

As the wheels of the hack rolled up the street and over my finer
feelings I turned to the Captain

Who was that gentleman sir

That was Mr Waldron

A relation of yours sir I asked craftily

No relation of minea relation of Nellys said the Captain smiling

A cousin I suggested feeling a strange hatred spring up in my bosom
for the unknown

Well I suppose you might call him a cousin for the present Hes going
to marry little Nelly next summer

In one of Peter Parleys valuable historical works is a description of
an earthquake at Lisbon At the first shock the inhabitants rushed into
the streets the earth yawned at their feet and the houses tottered and
fell on every side I staggered past the Captain into the street a
giddiness came over me the earth yawned at my feet and the houses
threatened to fall in on every side of me How distinctly I remember
that momentary sense of confusion when everything in the world seemed
toppling over into ruins

As I have remarked my love for Nelly is a thing of the past I had not
thought of her for years until I sat down to write this chapter and
yet now that all is said and done I shouldnt care particularly to
come across Mrs Waldrons eldest boy in my afternoons walk He must be
fourteen or fifteen years old by this timethe young villain




Chapter NineteenI Become A Blighted Being


When a young boy gets to be an old boy when the hair is growing
rather thin on the top of the old boys head and he has been tamed
sufficiently to take a sort of chastened pleasure in allowing the baby
to play with his watchsealswhen I say an old boy has reached this
stage in the journey of life he is sometimes apt to indulge in sportive
remarks concerning his first love

Now though I bless my stars that it wasnt in my power to marry Miss
Nelly I am not going to deny my boyish regard for her nor laugh at
it As long as it lasted it was a very sincere and unselfish love and
rendered me proportionately wretched I say as long as it lasted for
ones first love doesnt last forever

I am ready however to laugh at the amusing figure I cut after I had
really ceased to have any deep feeling in the matter It was then I took
it into my head to be a Blighted Being This was about two weeks after
the spectral appearance of Mr Waldron

For a boy of a naturally vivacious disposition the part of a blighted
being presented difficulties I had an excellent appetite I liked
society I liked outofdoor sports I was fond of handsome clothes Now
all these things were incompatible with the doleful character I was to
assume and I proceeded to cast them from me I neglected my hair I
avoided my playmates I frowned abstractedly I didnt eat as much as
was good for me I took lonely walks I brooded in solitude I not only
committed to memory the more turgid poems of the late Lord ByronFare
thee well and if forever cbut I became a despondent poet on my own
account and composed a string of Stanzas to One who will understand
them I think I was a trifle too hopeful on that point for I came
across the verses several years afterwards and was quite unable to
understand them myself

It was a great comfort to be so perfectly miserable and yet not suffer
any I used to look in the glass and gloat over the amount and variety
of mournful expression I could throw into my features If I caught
myself smiling at anything I cut the smile short with a sigh The
oddest thing about all this is I never once suspected that I was not
unhappy No one not even Pepper Whitcomb was more deceived than I

Among the minor pleasures of being blighted were the interest and
perplexity I excited in the simple souls that were thrown in daily
contact with me Pepper especially I nearly drove him into a
corresponding state of mind

I had from time to time given Pepper slight but impressive hints of my
admiration for Some One this was in the early part of Miss Glentworths
visit I had also led him to infer that my admiration was not
altogether in vain He was therefore unable to explain the cause of
my strange behavior for I had carefully refrained from mentioning to
Pepper the fact that Some One had turned out to be Anothers

I treated Pepper shabbily I couldnt resist playing on his tenderer
feelings He was a boy bubbling over with sympathy for anyone in any
kind of trouble Our intimacy since Binny Wallaces death had been
uninterrupted but now I moved in a sphere apart not to be profaned by
the step of an outsider

I no longer joined the boys on the playground at recess I stayed at my
desk reading some lugubrious volumeusually The Mysteries of Udolpho by
the amiable Mrs Radcliffe A translation of The Sorrows of Werter fell
into my hands at this period and if I could have committed suicide
without killing myself I should certainly have done so

On halfholidays instead of fraternizing with Pepper and the rest of
our clique I would wander off alone to Grave Point

Grave Pointthe place where Binny Wallaces body came ashorewas a
narrow strip of land running out into the river A line of Lombardy
poplars stiff and severe like a row of grenadiers mounted guard on
the waterside On the extreme end of the peninsula was an old disused
graveyard tenanted principally by the early settlers who had been
scalped by the Indians In a remote corner of the cemetery set apart
from the other mounds was the grave of a woman who had been hanged
in the old colonial times for the murder of her infant Goodwife Polly
Haines had denied the crime to the last and after her death there had
arisen strong doubts as to her actual guilt It was a belief current
among the lads of the town that if you went to this grave at nightfall
on the 10th of Novemberthe anniversary of her executionand asked For
what did the magistrates hang you a voice would reply Nothing

Many a Rivermouth boy has tremblingly put this question in the dark
and sure enough Polly Haines invariably answered nothing

A low redbrick wall broken down in many places and frosted over with
silvery moss surrounded this burialground of our Pilgrim Fathers and
their immediate descendants The latest date on any of the headstones
was 1780 A crop of very funny epitaphs sprung up here and there among
the overgrown thistles and burdocks and almost every tablet had a
deathshead with crossbones engraved upon it or else a puffy round
face with a pair of wings stretching out from the ears like this



Cherub Graphic



These mortuary emblems furnished me with congenial food for reflection
I used to lie in the long grass and speculate on the advantages and
disadvantages of being a cherub

I forget what I thought the advantages were but I remember distinctly
of getting into an inextricable tangle on two points How could a
cherub being all head and wings manage to sit down when he was tired
To have to sit down on the back of his head struck me as an awkward
alternative Again Where did a cherub carry those indispensable
articles such as jackknives marbles and pieces of twine which
boys in an earthly state of existence usually stow away in their
trouserspockets

These were knotty questions and I was never able to dispose of them
satisfactorily

Meanwhile Pepper Whitcomb would scour the whole town in search of me
He finally discovered my retreat and dropped in on me abruptly one
afternoon while I was deep in the cherub problem

Look here Tom Bailey said Pepper shying a piece of clamshell
indignantly at the file jacet on a neighboring gravestone You are just
going to the dogs Cant you tell a fellow what in thunder ails you
instead of prowling round among the tombs like a jolly old vampire

Pepper I replied solemnly dont ask me All is not well
heretouching my breast mysteriously If I had touched my head instead
I should have been nearer the mark

Pepper stared at me

Earthly happiness I continued is a delusion and a snare You will
never be happy Pepper until you are a cherub

Pepper by the by would have made an excellent cherub he was so
chubby Having delivered myself of these gloomy remarks I arose
languidly from the grass and moved away leaving Pepper staring after
me in mute astonishment I was Hamlet and Werter and the late Lord Byron
all in one

You will ask what my purpose was in cultivating this factitious
despondency None whatever Blighted beings never have any purpose in
life excepting to be as blighted as possible

Of course my present line of business could not long escape the eye of
Captain Nutter I dont know if the Captain suspected my attachment for
Miss Glentworth He never alluded to it but he watched me Miss Abigail
watched me Kitty Collins watched me and Sailor Ben watched me

I cant make out his signals I overheard the Admiral remark to my
grandfather one day I hope he aint got no kind of sickness aboard

There was something singularly agreeable in being an object of so great
interest Sometimes I had all I could do to preserve my dejected aspect
it was so pleasant to be miserable I incline to the opinion that
people who are melancholy without any particular reason such as poets
artists and young musicians with long hair have rather an enviable
time of it In a quiet way I never enjoyed myself better in my life than
when I was a Blighted Being




Chapter TwentyI Prove Myself To Be the Grandson of My Grandfather


It was not possible for a boy of my temperament to be a blighted being
longer than three consecutive weeks

I was gradually emerging from my selfimposed cloud when events took
place that greatly assisted in restoring me to a more natural frame of
mind I awoke from an imaginary trouble to face a real one

I suppose you dont know what a financial crisis is I will give you an
illustration

You are deeply in debtsay to the amount of a quarter of a dollarto the
little knicknack shop round the corner where they sell picturepapers
sprucegum needles and Malaga raisins A boy owes you a quarter of a
dollar which he promises to pay at a certain time You are depending
on this quarter to settle accounts with the small shopkeeper The
time arrivesand the quarter doesnt Thats a financial crisis in one
sensetwentyfive senses if I may say so

When this same thing happens on a grander scale in the mercantile
world it produces what is called a panic One mans inability to pay
his debts ruins another man who in turn ruins someone else and
so on until failure after failure makes even the richest capitalists
tremble Public confidence is suspended and the smaller fry of
merchants are knocked over like tenpins

These commercial panics occur periodically after the fashion of comets
and earthquakes and other disagreeable things

Such a panic took place in New Orleans in the year 18 and my fathers
bankinghouse went to pieces in the crash

Of a comparatively large fortune nothing remained after paying his debts
excepting a few thousand dollars with which he proposed to return North
and embark in some less hazardous enterprise In the meantime it was
necessary for him to stay in New Orleans to wind up the business

My grandfather was in some way involved in this failure and lost I
fancy a considerable sum of money but he never talked much on the
subject He was an unflinching believer in the spiltmilk proverb

It cant be gathered up he would say and its no use crying over
it Pitch into the cow and get some more milk is my motto

The suspension of the bankinghouse was bad enough but there was an
attending circumstance that gave us at Rivermouth a great deal more
anxiety The cholera which someone predicted would visit the country
that year and which indeed had made its appearance in a mild form
at several points along the Mississippi River had broken out with much
violence at New Orleans

The report that first reached us through the newspapers was meagre and
contradictory many people discredited it but a letter from my mother
left us no room for doubt The sickness was in the city The hospitals
were filling up and hundreds of the citizens were flying from the
stricken place by every steamboat The unsettled state of my fathers
affairs made it imperative for him to remain at his post his desertion
at that moment would have been at the sacrifice of all he had saved from
the general wreck

As he would be detained in New Orleans at least three months my mother
declined to come North without him

After this we awaited with feverish impatience the weekly news that came
to us from the South The next letter advised us that my parents were
well and that the sickness so far had not penetrated to the faubourg
or district where they lived The following week brought less cheering
tidings My fathers business in consequence of the flight of the other
partners would keep him in the city beyond the period he had mentioned
The family had moved to Pass Christian a favorite wateringplace on
Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans where he was able to spend part of
each week So the return North was postponed indefinitely

It was now that the old longing to see my parents came back to me with
irresistible force I knew my grandfather would not listen to the
idea of my going to New Orleans at such a dangerous time since he had
opposed the journey so strongly when the same objection did not exist
But I determined to go nevertheless

I think I have mentioned the fact that all the male members of our
family on my fathers sideas far back as the Middle Ageshave
exhibited in early youth a decided talent for running away It was an
hereditary talent It ran in the blood to run away I do not pretend to
explain the peculiarity I simply admit it

It was not my fate to change the prescribed order of things I too was
to run away thereby proving if any proof were needed that I was the
grandson of my grandfather I do not hold myself responsible for the
step any more than I do for the shape of my nose which is said to be a
facsimile of Captain Nutters

I have frequently noticed how circumstances conspire to help a man or
a boy when he has thoroughly resolved on doing a thing That very week
the Rivermouth Barnacle printed an advertisement that seemed to have
been written on purpose for me It read as follows

WANTED A Few Ablebodied Seamen and a CabinBoy for the ship Rawlings
now loading for New Orleans at Johnsons Wharf Boston Apply in person
within four days at the office of Messrs Co or on board the Ship

How I was to get to New Orleans with only 462 was a question that had
been bothering me This advertisement made it as clear as day I would
go as cabinboy

I had taken Pepper into my confidence again I had told him the story
of my love for Miss Glentworth with all its harrowing details and now
conceived it judicious to confide in him the change about to take place
in my life so that if the Rawlings went down in a gale my friends
might have the limited satisfaction of knowing what had become of me

Pepper shook his head discouragingly and sought in every way to
dissuade me from the step He drew a disenchanting picture of the
existence of a cabinboy whose constant duty according to Pepper was
to have dishes broken over his head whenever the captain or the mate
chanced to be out of humor which was mostly all the time But nothing
Pepper said could turn me a hairsbreadth from my purpose

I had little time to spare for the advertisement stated explicitly that
applications were to be made in person within four days I trembled
to think of the bare possibility of some other boy snapping up that
desirable situation

It was on Monday that I stumbled upon the advertisement On Tuesday my
preparations were completed My baggageconsisting of four shirts half
a dozen collars a piece of shoemakers wax Heaven knows what for
and seven stockings wrapped in a silk handkerchieflay hidden under a
loose plank of the stable floor This was my point of departure

My plan was to take the last train for Boston in order to prevent the
possibility of immediate pursuit if any should be attempted The train
left at 4 PM

I ate no breakfast and little dinner that day I avoided the Captains
eye and wouldnt have looked Miss Abigail or Kitty in the face for the
wealth of the Indies

When it was time to start for the station I retired quietly to the
stable and uncovered my bundle I lingered a moment to kiss the white
star on Gypsys forehead and was nearly unmanned when the little animal
returned the caress by lapping my cheek Twice I went back and patted
her

On reaching the station I purchased my ticket with a bravado air that
ought to have aroused the suspicion of the ticketmaster and hurried to
the car where I sat fidgeting until the train shot out into the broad
daylight

Then I drew a long breath and looked about me The first object that
saluted my sight was Sailor Ben four or five seats behind me reading
the Rivermouth Barnacle

Reading was not an easy art to Sailor Ben he grappled with the sense of
a paragraph as if it were a polarbear and generally got the worst of
it On the present occasion he was having a hard struggle judging by
the way he worked his mouth and rolled his eyes He had evidently not
seen me But what was he doing on the Boston train

Without lingering to solve the question I stole gently from my seat and
passed into the forward car

This was very awkward having the Admiral on board I couldnt
understand it at all Could it be possible that the old boy had got
tired of land and was running away to sea himself That was too absurd
I glanced nervously towards the car door now and then half expecting to
see him come after me

We had passed one or two waystations and I had quieted down a good
deal when I began to feel as if somebody was looking steadily at the
back of my head I turned round involuntarily and there was Sailor
Ben again at the farther end of the car wrestling with the Rivermouth
Barnacle as before

I began to grow very uncomfortable indeed Was it by design or chance
that he thus dogged my steps If he was aware of my presence why didnt
he speak to me at once Why did he steal round making no sign like a
particularly unpleasant phantom Maybe it wasnt Sailor Ben I peeped at
him slyly There was no mistaking that tanned genial phiz of his Very
odd he didnt see me

Literature even in the mild form of a country newspaper always had the
effect of poppies on the Admiral When I stole another glance in his
direction his hat was tilted over his right eye in the most dissolute
style and the Rivermouth Barnacle lay in a confused heap beside him He
had succumbed He was fast asleep If he would only keep asleep until we
reached our destination

By and by I discovered that the rear car had been detached from the
train at the last stoppingplace This accounted satisfactorily for
Sailor Bens singular movements and considerably calmed my fears
Nevertheless I did not like the aspect of things

The Admiral continued to snooze like a good fellow and was snoring
melodiously as we glided at a slackened pace over a bridge and into
Boston

I grasped my pilgrims bundle and hurrying out of the car dashed up
the first street that presented itself

It was a narrow noisy zigzag street crowded with trucks and
obstructed with bales and boxes of merchandise I didnt pause to
breathe until I had placed a respectable distance between me and the
railway station By this time it was nearly twilight

I had got into the region of dwellinghouses and was about to seat
myself on a doorstep to rest when lo there was the Admiral trundling
along on the opposite sidewalk under a full spread of canvas as he
would have expressed it

I was off again in an instant at a rapid pace but in spite of all I
could do he held his own without any perceptible exertion He had a very
ugly gait to get away from the Admiral I didnt dare to run for
fear of being mistaken for a thief a suspicion which my bundle would
naturally lend color to

I pushed ahead however at a brisk trot and must have got over one or
two milesmy pursuer neither gaining nor losing groundwhen I concluded
to surrender at discretion I saw that Sailor Ben was determined to have
me and knowing my man I knew that escape was highly improbable

So I turned round and waited for him to catch up with me which he did
in a few seconds looking rather sheepish at first

Sailor Ben said I severely do I understand that you are dogging my
steps

Well little messmate replied the Admiral rubbing his nose which
he always did when he was disconcerted I am kind o followin in your
wake

Under orders

Under orders

Under the Captains orders

Surely

In other words my grandfather has sent you to fetch me back to
Rivermouth

Thats about it said the Admiral with a burst of frankness

And I must go with you whether I want to or not

The Capens very identical words

There was nothing to be done I bit my lips with suppressed anger and
signified that I was at his disposal since I couldnt help it The
impression was very strong in my mind that the Admiral wouldnt hesitate
to put me in irons if I showed signs of mutiny

It was too late to return to Rivermouth that nighta fact which I
communicated to the old boy sullenly inquiring at the same time what he
proposed to do about it

He said we would cruise about for some rations and then make a night
of it I didnt condescend to reply though I hailed the suggestion of
something to eat with inward enthusiasm for I had not taken enough food
that day to keep life in a canary

We wandered back to the railway station in the waiting room of which
was a kind of restaurant presided over by a severelooking young lady
Here we had a cup of coffee apiece several tough doughnuts and some
blocks of venerable spongecake The young lady who attended on us
whatever her age was then must have been a mere child when that
spongecake was made

The Admirals acquaintance with Boston hotels was slight but he knew
of a quiet lodginghouse near by much patronized by seacaptains and
kept by a former friend of his

In this house which had seen its best days we were accommodated with
a mouldy chamber containing two cotbeds two chairs and a cracked
pitcher on a washstand The mantelshelf was ornamented with three big
pink conchshells resembling pieces of petrified liver and over these
hung a cheap lurid print in which a United States sloopofwar was
giving a British frigate particular fits It is very strange how our own
ships never seem to suffer any in these terrible engagements It shows
what a nation we are

An oillamp on a dealtable cast a dismal glare over the apartment
which was cheerless in the extreme I thought of our sittingroom at
home with its flowery wallpaper and gay curtains and soft lounges I
saw Major Elkanah Nutter my grandfathers father in powdered wig and
Federal uniform looking down benevolently from his gilt frame between
the bookcases I pictured the Captain and Miss Abigail sitting at the
cosey round table in the moonlike glow of the astral lamp and then I
fell to wondering how they would receive me when I came back I wondered
if the Prodigal Son had any idea that his father was going to kill the
fatted calf for him and how he felt about it on the whole

Though I was very low in spirits I put on a bold front to Sailor
Ben you will understand To be caught and caged in this manner was a
frightful shock to my vanity He tried to draw me into conversation
but I answered in icy monosyllables He again suggested we should make
a night of it and hinted broadly that he was game for any amount of
riotous dissipation even to the extent of going to see a play if I
wanted to I declined haughtily I was dying to go

He then threw out a feeler on the subject of dominos and checkers and
observed in a general way that seven up was a capital game but I
repulsed him at every point

I saw that the Admiral was beginning to feel hurt by my systematic
coldness We had always been such hearty friends until now It was
too bad of me to fret that tender honest old heart even for an hour
I really did love the ancient boy and when in a disconsolate way he
ordered up a pitcher of beer I unbent so far as to partake of some in a
teacup He recovered his spirits instantly and took out his cuddy clay
pipe for a smoke

Between the beer and the soothing fragrance of the navyplug I fell
into a pleasanter mood myself and it being too late now to go to the
theatre I condescended to sayaddressing the northwest corner of the
ceilingthat seven up was a capital game Upon this hint the Admiral
disappeared and returned shortly with a very dirty pack of cards

As we played with varying fortunes by the flickering flame of the
lamp he sipped his beer and became communicative He seemed immensely
tickled by the fact that I had come to Boston It leaked out presently
that he and the Captain had had a wager on the subject

The discovery of my plans and who had discovered them were points on
which the Admiral refused to throw any light They had been discovered
however and the Captain had laughed at the idea of my running away
Sailor Ben on the contrary had stoutly contended that I meant to slip
cable and be off Whereupon the Captain offered to bet him a dollar that
I wouldnt go And it was partly on account of this wager that Sailor
Ben refrained from capturing me when he might have done so at the start

Now as the fare to and from Boston with the lodging expenses would
cost him at least five dollars I didnt see what he gained by winning
the wager The Admiral rubbed his nose violently when this view of the
case presented itself

I asked him why he didnt take me from the train at the first
stoppingplace and return to Rivermouth by the down train at 430 He
explained having purchased a ticket for Boston he considered himself
bound to the owners the stockholders of the road to fulfil his part of
the contract To use his own words he had shipped for the viage

This struck me as being so deliciously funny that after I was in bed
and the light was out I couldnt help laughing aloud once or twice I
suppose the Admiral must have thought I was meditating another escape
for he made periodical visits to my bed throughout the night satisfying
himself by kneading me all over that I hadnt evaporated

I was all there the next morning when Sailor Ben half awakened me by
shouting merrily All hands on deck The words rang in my ears like a
part of my own dream for I was at that instant climbing up the side of
the Rawlings to offer myself as cabinboy

The Admiral was obliged to shake me roughly two or three times before he
could detach me from the dream I opened my eyes with effort and stared
stupidly round the room Bit by bit my real situation dawned on me
What a sickening sensation that is when one is in trouble to wake up
feeling free for a moment and then to find yesterdays sorrow all ready
to go on again

Well little messmate how fares it

I was too much depressed to reply The thought of returning to
Rivermouth chilled me How could I face Captain Nutter to say nothing
of Miss Abigail and Kitty How the Temple Grammar School boys would look
at me How Conway and Seth Rodgers would exult over my mortification
And what if the Rev Wibird Hawkins should allude to me in his next
Sundays sermon

Sailor Ben was wise in keeping an eye on me for after these thoughts
took possession of my mind I wanted only the opportunity to give him
the slip

The keeper of the lodgings did not supply meals to his guests so we
breakfasted at a small chophouse in a crooked street on our way to the
cars The city was not astir yet and looked glum and careworn in the
damp morning atmosphere

Here and there as we passed along was a sharpfaced shopboy taking down
shutters and now and then we met a seedy man who had evidently spent
the night in a doorway Such early birds and a few laborers with their
tin kettles were the only signs of life to be seen until we came to the
station where I insisted on paying for my own ticket I didnt relish
being conveyed from place to place like a felon changing prisons at
somebody elses expense

On entering the car I sunk into a seat next the window and Sailor Ben
deposited himself beside me cutting off all chance of escape

The car filled up soon after this and I wondered if there was anything
in my mien that would lead the other passengers to suspect I was a boy
who had run away and was being brought back

A man in front of ushe was nearsighted as I discovered later by his
reading a guidebook with his nosebrought the blood to my cheeks by
turning round and peering at me steadily I rubbed a clear spot on the
cloudy windowglass at my elbow and looked out to avoid him

There in the travellers room was the severelooking young lady piling
up her blocks of spongecake in alluring pyramids and industriously
intrenching herself behind a breastwork of squashpie I saw with
cynical pleasure numerous victims walk up to the counter and recklessly
sow the seeds of death in their constitutions by eating her doughnuts I
had got quite interested in her when the whistle sounded and the train
began to move

The Admiral and I did not talk much on the journey I stared out of the
window most of the time speculating as to the probable nature of the
reception in store for me at the terminus of the road

What would the Captain say and Mr Grimshaw what would he do about
it Then I thought of Pepper Whitcomb Dire was the vengeance I meant to
wreak on Pepper for who but he had betrayed me Pepper alone had been
the repository of my secretperfidious Pepper

As we left station after station behind us I felt less and less like
encountering the members of our family Sailor Ben fathomed what was
passing in my mind for he leaned over and said

I dont think as the Capen will bear down very hard on you

But it wasnt that It wasnt the fear of any physical punishment that
might be inflicted it was a sense of my own folly that was creeping
over me for during the long silent ride I had examined my conduct from
every standpoint and there was no view I could take of myself in which
I did not look like a very foolish person indeed

As we came within sight of the spires of Rivermouth I wouldnt have
cared if the up train which met us outside the town had run into us
and ended me

Contrary to my expectation and dread the Captain was not visible when
we stepped from the cars Sailor Ben glanced among the crowd of faces
apparently looking for him too Conway was therehe was always hanging
about the stationand if he had intimated in any way that he knew of my
disgrace and enjoyed it I should have walked into him I am certain

But this defiant feeling entirely deserted me by the time we reached the
Nutter House The Captain himself opened the door

Come on board sir said Sailor Ben scraping his left foot and
touching his hat seafashion

My grandfather nodded to Sailor Ben somewhat coldly I thought and much
to my astonishment kindly took me by the hand

I was unprepared for this and the tears which no amount of severity
would have wrung from me welled up to my eyes

The expression of my grandfathers face as I glanced at it hastily
was grave and gentle there was nothing in it of anger or reproof I
followed him into the sittingroom and obeying a motion of his hand
seated myself on the sofa He remained standing by the round table for a
moment lost in thought then leaned over and picked up a letter

It was a letter with a great black seal




Chapter TwentyOneIn Which I Leave Rivermouth


A letter with a great black seal

I knew then what had happened as well as I know it now But which
was it father or mother I do not like to look back to the agony and
suspense of that moment

My father had died at New Orleans during one of his weekly visits to
the city The letter bearing these tidings had reached Rivermouth the
evening of my flighthad passed me on the road by the down train

I must turn back for a moment to that eventful evening When I failed
to make my appearance at supper the Captain began to suspect that I had
really started on my wild tour southwarda conjecture which Sailor Bens
absence helped to confirm I had evidently got off by the train and
Sailor Ben had followed me

There was no telegraphic communication between Boston and Rivermouth
in those days so my grandfather could do nothing but await the result
Even if there had been another mail to Boston he could not have availed
himself of it not knowing how to address a message to the fugitives
The postoffice was naturally the last place either I or the Admiral
would think of visiting

My grandfather however was too full of trouble to allow this to add to
his distress He knew that the faithful old sailor would not let me come
to any harm and even if I had managed for the time being to elude him
was sure to bring me back sooner or later

Our return therefore by the first train on the following day did not
surprise him

I was greatly puzzled as I have said by the gentle manner of his
reception but when we were alone together in the sittingroom and he
began slowly to unfold the letter I understood it all I caught a sight
of my mothers handwriting in the superscription and there was nothing
left to tell me

My grandfather held the letter a few seconds irresolutely and then
commenced reading it aloud but he could get no further than the date

I cant read it Tom said the old gentleman breaking down I
thought I could

He handed it to me I took the letter mechanically and hurried away
with it to my little room where I had passed so many happy hours

The week that followed the receipt of this letter is nearly a blank in
my memory I remember that the days appeared endless that at times
I could not realize the misfortune that had befallen us and my heart
upbraided me for not feeling a deeper grief that a full sense of my
loss would now and then sweep over me like an inspiration and I would
steal away to my chamber or wander forlornly about the gardens I
remember this but little more

As the days went by my first grief subsided and in its place grew up
a want which I have experienced at every step in life from boyhood to
manhood Often even now after all these years when I see a lad of
twelve or fourteen walking by his fathers side and glancing merrily
up at his face I turn and look after them and am conscious that I have
missed companionship most sweet and sacred

I shall not dwell on this portion of my story There were many tranquil
pleasant hours in store for me at that period and I prefer to turn to
them


One evening the Captain came smiling into the sittingroom with an open
letter in his hand My mother had arrived at New York and would be
with us the next day For the first time in weeksyears it seemed to
mesomething of the old cheerfulness mingled with our conversation round
the evening lamp I was to go to Boston with the Captain to meet her and
bring her home I need not describe that meeting With my mothers hand
in mine once more all the long years we had been parted appeared like a
dream Very dear to me was the sight of that slender pale woman
passing from room to room and lending a patient grace and beauty to the
saddened life of the old house

Everything was changed with us now There were consultations with
lawyers and signing of papers and correspondence for my fathers
affairs had been left in great confusion And when these were settled
the evenings were not long enough for us to hear all my mother had to
tell of the scenes she had passed through in the illfated city

Then there were old times to talk over full of reminiscences of Aunt
Chloe and little Black Sam Little Black Sam by the by had been taken
by his master from my fathers service ten months previously and put on
a sugarplantation near Baton Rouge Not relishing the change Sam had
run away and by some mysterious agency got into Canada from which
place he had sent back several indecorous messages to his late owner
Aunt Chloe was still in New Orleans employed as nurse in one of the
cholera hospital wards and the Desmoulins near neighbors of ours had
purchased the pretty stone house among the orangetrees

How all these simple details interested me will be readily understood by
any boy who has been long absent from home

I was sorry when it became necessary to discuss questions more nearly
affecting myself I had been removed from school temporarily but it
was decided after much consideration that I should not return the
decision being left in a manner in my own hands

The Captain wished to carry out his sons intention and send me to
college for which I was nearly fitted but our means did not admit of
this The Captain too could ill afford to bear the expense for his
losses by the failure of the New Orleans business had been heavy Yet he
insisted on the plan not seeing clearly what other disposal to make of
me

In the midst of our discussions a letter came from my Uncle Snow
a merchant in New York generously offering me a place in his
countinghouse The case resolved itself into this If I went to
college I should have to be dependent on Captain Nutter for several
years and at the end of the collegiate course would have no settled
profession If I accepted my uncles offer I might hope to work my
way to independence without loss of time It was hard to give up the
longcherished dream of being a Harvard boy but I gave it up

The decision once made it was Uncle Snows wish that I should enter
his countinghouse immediately The cause of my good uncles haste was
thishe was afraid that I would turn out to be a poet before he could
make a merchant of me His fears were based upon the fact that I had
published in the Rivermouth Barnacle some verses addressed in a familiar
manner To the Moon Now the idea of a boy with his living to get
placing himself in communication with the Moon struck the mercantile
mind as monstrous It was not only a bad investment it was lunacy

We adopted Uncle Snows views so far as to accede to his proposition
forthwith My mother I neglected to say was also to reside in New
York

I shall not draw a picture of Pepper Whitcombs disgust when the news
was imparted to him nor attempt to paint Sailor Bens distress at the
prospect of losing his little messmate

In the excitement of preparing for the journey I didnt feel any very
deep regret myself But when the moment came for leaving and I saw my
small trunk lashed up behind the carriage then the pleasantness of the
old life and a vague dread of the new came over me and a mist filled my
eyes shutting out the group of schoolfellows including all the members
of the Centipede Club who had come down to the house to see me off

As the carriage swept round the corner I leaned out of the window to
take a last look at Sailor Bens cottage and there was the Admirals
flag flying at halfmast

So I left Rivermouth little dreaming that I was not to see the old
place again for many and many a year




Chapter TwentyTwoExeunt Omnes


With the close of my schooldays at Rivermouth this modest chronicle
ends

The new life upon which I entered the new friends and foes I
encountered on the road and what I did and what I did not are matters
that do not come within the scope of these pages But before I write
Finis to the record as it stands before I leave itfeeling as if I
were once more going away from my boyhoodI have a word or two to say
concerning a few of the personages who have figured in the story if you
will allow me to call Gypsy a personage

I am sure that the reader who has followed me thus far will be willing
to hear what became of her and Sailor Ben and Miss Abigail and the
Captain

First about Gypsy A month after my departure from Rivermouth the Captain
informed me by letter that he had parted with the little mare according
to agreement She had been sold to the ringmaster of a travelling
circus I had stipulated on this disposal of her and was about to set
out on her travels She did not disappoint my glowing anticipations but
became quite a celebrity in her wayby dancing the polka to slow music
on a pineboard ballroom constructed for the purpose

I chanced once a long while afterwards to be in a country town where
her troupe was giving exhibitions I even read the gaudily illumined
showbill setting forth the accomplishments of Zuleika the famed
Arabian Trick Ponybut I failed to recognize my dear little Mustang
girl behind those highsounding titles and so alas did not attend the
performance I hope all the praises she received and all the spangled
trappings she wore did not spoil her but I am afraid they did for she
was always over much given to the vanities of this world

Miss Abigail regulated the domestic destinies of my grandfathers
household until the day of her death which Dr Theophilus Tredick
solemnly averred was hastened by the inveterate habit she had contracted
of swallowing unknown quantities of hotdrops whenever she fancied
herself out of sorts Eightyseven empty phials were found in a
bonnetbox on a shelf in her bedroom closet

The old house became very lonely when the family got reduced to Captain
Nutter and Kitty and when Kitty passed away my grandfather divided his
time between Rivermouth and New York

Sailor Ben did not long survive his little Irish lass as he always
fondly called her At his demise which took place about six years
since he left his property in trust to the managers of a Home for Aged
Mariners In his will which was a very whimsical documentwritten by
himself and worded with much shrewdness toohe warned the Trustees
that when he got aloft he intended to keep his weather eye on them
and should send a speritual shot across their bows and bring them to
if they didnt treat the Aged Mariners handsomely

He also expressed a wish to have his body stitched up in a shotted
hammock and dropped into the harbor but as he did not strenuously
insist on this and as it was not in accordance with my grandfathers
preconceived notions of Christian burial the Admiral was laid to rest
beside Kitty in the Old South Burying Ground with an anchor that would
have delighted him neatly carved on his headstone

I am sorry the fire has gone out in the old ships stove in that
skyblue cottage at the head of the wharf I am sorry they have taken
down the flagstaff and painted over the funny portholes for I loved
the old cabin as it was They might have let it alone

For several months after leaving Rivermouth I carried on a voluminous
correspondence with Pepper Whitcomb but it gradually dwindled down to a
single letter a month and then to none at all But while he remained
at the Temple Grammar School he kept me advised of the current gossip of
the town and the doings of the Centipedes

As one by one the boys left the academyAdams Harris Marden Blake
and Langdonto seek their fortunes elsewhere there was less to interest
me in the old seaport and when Pepper himself went to Philadelphia to
read law I had no one to give me an inkling of what was going on

There wasnt much to go on to be sure Great events no longer
considered it worth their while to honor so quiet a place

One Fourth of July the Temple Grammar School burnt downset on fire it
was supposed by an eccentric squib that was seen to bolt into an upper
windowand Mr Grimshaw retired from public life married and lived
happily ever after as the storybooks say

The Widow Conway I am able to state did not succeed in enslaving Mr
Meeks the apothecary who united himself clandestinely to one of Miss
Dorothy Gibbss young ladies and lost the patronage of Primrose Hall in
consequence

Young Conway went into the grocery business with his ancient chum
RodgersRODGERS  CONWAY I read the sign only last summer when I was
down in Rivermouth and had half a mind to pop into the shop and shake
hands with him and ask him if he wanted to fight I contented myself
however with flattening my nose against his dingy shopwindow and
beheld Conway in red whiskers and blue overalls weighing out sugar for
a customergiving him short weight Ill bet anything

I have reserved my pleasantest word for the last It is touching the
Captain The Captain is still hale and rosy and if he doesnt relate
his exploit in the War of 1812 as spiritedly as he used to he makes up
by relating it more frequently and telling it differently every time
He passes his winters in New York and his summers in the Nutter House
which threatens to prove a hard nut for the destructive gentleman with
the scythe and the hourglass for the seaward gable has not yielded a
clapboard to the eastwind these twenty years The Captain has now become
the Oldest Inhabitant in Rivermouth and so I dont laugh at the Oldest
Inhabitant any more but pray in my heart that he may occupy the post of
honor for half a century to come

So ends the Story of a Bad Boybut not such a very bad boy as I told
you to begin with

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
