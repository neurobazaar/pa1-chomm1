THE LAST GUN AT SNAKE RIVER


What had been in the cool gray of that summer morning a dewy country
lane marked only by a few wagon tracks that never encroached upon its
grassy border and indented only by the faint footprints of a crossing
fox or coon was now before high noon already crushed beaten down
and trampled out of all semblance of its former graciousness The heavy
springless jolt of guncarriage and caisson had cut deeply through the
middle track the hoofs of crowding cavalry had struck down and shredded
the wayside vines and bushes to bury them under a cloud of following
dust and the short plunging doublequick of infantry had trodden out
this hideous ruin into one dusty level chaos Along that rudely widened
highway useless muskets torn accoutrements knapsacks caps and
articles of clothing were scattered with here and there the larger
wrecks of brokendown wagons roughly thrown aside into the ditch to
make way for the living current For two hours the greater part of
an army corps had passed and repassed that way but coming or going
always with faces turned eagerly towards an open slope on the right
which ran parallel to the lane And yet nothing was to be seen there
For two hours a gray and bluish cloud rent and shaken with explosion
after explosion but always closing and thickening after each discharge
was all that had met their eyes Nevertheless into this ominous cloud
solid moving masses of men in gray or blue had that morning melted away
or emerged from it only as scattered fragments that crept crawled
ran or clung together in groups to be followed and overtaken in the
rolling vapor

But for the last half hour the desolated track had stretched empty and
deserted While there was no cessation of the rattling crackling and
detonations on the fateful slope beyond it had still been silent Once
or twice it had been crossed by timid hurrying wings and frightened
and hesitating little feet or later by skulkers and stragglers from
the main column who were tempted to enter it from the hedges and bushes
where they had been creeping and hiding Suddenly a prolonged yell from
the hidden slope beyondthe nearest sound that had yet been heard from
that ominous distancesent them to cover again It was followed by
the furious galloping of horses in the lane and a handsome redcapped
officer accompanied by an orderly dashed down the track wheeled
leaped the hedge rode out on the slope and halted In another instant a
cloud of dust came whirling down the lane after him Out of it strained
the heavy shoulders and tightened chaintraces of six frantic horses
dragging the swaying gun that in this tempest of motion alone seemed
passive and helpless with an awful foreknowledge of its power As in
obedience to a signal from the officer they crashed through the hedge
after him a sudden jolt threw an artilleryman from the limber before
the wheel A driver glanced back on the tense chain and hesitated Go
on yelled the prostrate man and the wheel went over him Another and
another gun followed out of the dust cloud until the whole battery had
deployed on the slope Before the drifting dust had fairly settled the
falling back of the panting horses with their drivers gave a momentary
glimpse of the nearest gun already in position and of the four erect
figures beside it The yell that seemed to have evoked this sudden
apparition again sounded nearer a blinding flash broke from the
gun which was instantly hidden by the closing group around it and
a deafening crash with the high ringing of metal ran down the lane A
column of white woolly smoke arose as another flash broke beside it
This was quickly followed by another and another with a response from
the gun first fired until the whole slope shook and thundered And the
smoke no longer white and woolly but darkening and thickening as with
unburnt grains of gunpowder mingled into the one ominous vapor and
driving along the lane hid even the slope from view

The yelling had ceased but the grinding and rattling heard through the
detonation of cannon came nearer still and suddenly there was a shower
of leaves and twigs from the lower branches of a chestnuttree near the
broken hedge As the smoke thinned again a rising and falling medley of
flapping hats tossing horses heads and shining steel appeared for an
instant advancing tumultuously up the slope But the apparition was as
instantly cloven by flame from the two nearest guns and went down in a
gush of smoke and roar of sound So level was the delivery and so close
the impact that a space seemed suddenly cleared between in which
the whirling of the shattered remnants of the charging cavalry was
distinctly seen and the shouts and oaths of the inextricably struggling
mass became plain and articulate Then a gunner serving the nearest
piece suddenly dropped his swab and seized a carbine for out of
the whirling confusion before them a single rider was seen galloping
furiously towards the gun

The redcapped young officer rode forward and knocked up the gunners
weapon with his sword For in that rapid glance he had seen that the
riders reins were hanging loosely on the neck of his horse who was
still dashing forwards with the frantic impetus of the charge and
that the youthful figure of the rider wearing the stripes of a
lieutenantalthough still erect exercised no control over the animal
The face was boyish blond and ghastly the eyes were set and glassy
It seemed as if Death itself were charging the gun

Within a few feet of it the horse swerved before a brandished rammer
and striking the cheeks of the guncarriage pitched his inanimate rider
across the gun The hot blood of the dead man smoked on the hotter brass
with the reek of the shambles and bespattered the hand of the gunner
who still mechanically served the vent As they lifted the dead body
down the order came to cease firing For the yells from below had
ceased too the rattling and grinding were receding with the smoke
farther to the left The ominous central cloud parted for a brief moment
and showed the unexpected sun glittering down the slope upon a near and
peaceful river

The young artillery officer had dismounted and was now gently examining
the dead man His breast had been crushed by a fragment of shell he
must have died instantly The same missile had cut the chain of a locket
which slipped from his opened coat The officer picked it up with a
strange feelingperhaps because he was conscious himself of wearing a
similar one perhaps because it might give him some clue to the mans
identity It contained only the photograph of a pretty girl a tendril
of fair hair and the word Sally In the breastpocket was a sealed
letter with the inscription For Miss Sally Dows To be delivered if I
fall by the mudsills hand A faint smile came over the officers face
he was about to hand the articles to a sergeant but changed his mind
and put them in his pocket

Meantime the lane and woods beyond and even the slope itself were
crowding with supports and waiting troops His own battery was still
unlimbered waiting orders There was a slight commotion in the lane

Very well done captain Smartly taken and gallantly held

It was the voice of a general officer passing with his staff There was
a note of pleasant relief in its tone and the middleaged caredrawn
face of its owner was relaxed in a paternal smile The young captain
flushed with pleasure

And you seem to have had close work too added the general pointing
to the dead man

The young officer hurriedly explained The general nodded saluted and
passed on But a youthful aide airily lingered

The old mans feeling good Courtland he said Weve rolled em up
all along the line Its all over now In point of fact I reckon youve
fired the last round in this particular fratricidal engagement

The last round Courtland remained silent looking abstractedly at the
man it had crushed and broken at his feet

And I shouldnt wonder if you got your goldleaf for todays work
But whos your sunny Southern friend here he added following his
companions eyes

Courtland repeated his story a little more seriously which however
failed to subdue the young aides levity So he concluded to stop
over he interrupted cheerfully But looking at the letter and
photograph I saylook here Sally Dows Why there was another man
picked up yesterday with a letter to the same girl Doc Murphy has it
And by Jove the same picture tooeh I say Sally must have gathered
in the boys and raked down the whole pile Look here Courty you might
get Doc Murphys letter and hunt her up when this cruel war is over Say
youre fulfilling a sacred trust See Good idea old man Tata and
he trotted quickly after his superior

Courtland remained with the letter and photograph in his hand gazing
abstractedly after him The smoke had rolled quite away from the fields
on the left but still hung heavily down the south on the heels of the
flying cavalry A long bugle call swelled up musically from below The
freed sun caught the white flags of two field hospitals in the woods
and glanced tranquilly on the broad cypressfringed lazyflowing
and cruel but beautiful Southern river which had all unseen crept so
smilingly that morning through the very heart of the battle


CHAPTER I


The two oclock express from Redlands to Forestville Georgia had
been proceeding with the languid placidity of the river whose banks it
skirted for more than two hours But unlike the river it had stopped
frequently sometimes at recognized stations and villages sometimes at
the apparition of strawhatted and linencoated natives in the solitude
of pine woods where after a decent interval of cheery conversation
with the conductor and engineer it either took the stranger on board
or relieved him of his parcel letter basket or even the verbal
message with which he was charged Much of the way lay through
pinebarren and swampy woods which had never been cleared or cultivated
much through decayed settlements and ruined villages that had remained
unchanged since the War of the Rebellion now three years past There
were vestiges of the severity of a former military occupation the
blackened timbers of railway bridges still unrepaired and along the
line of a certain memorable march sections of iron rails taken from
the tornup track roasted in bonfires and bent while redhot around the
trunks of trees were still to be seen These mementos of defeat seemed
to excite neither revenge nor the energy to remove them the dull apathy
which had succeeded the days of hysterical passion and convulsion still
lingered even the slow improvement that could be detected was marked
by the languor of convalescence The helplessness of a race hitherto
dependent upon certain barbaric conditions or political place and power
unskilled in invention and suddenly confronted with the necessity of
personal labor was visible everywhere Eyes that but three short years
before had turned vindictively to the North now gazed wistfully to that
quarter for help and direction They scanned eagerly the faces of their
energetic and prosperous neighborsand quondam foesupon the verandas
of Southern hotels and the decks of Southern steamboats and were even
now watching from a group in the woods the windows of the halted train
where the faces appeared of two men of manifestly different types but
still alien to the country in dress features and accent

Two negroes were slowly loading the engine tender from a woodpile The
rich brown smoke of the turpentine knots was filling the train with its
stinging fragrance The elder of the two Northern passengers with sharp
New England angles in his face impatiently glanced at his watch

Of all created shiftlessness this beats everything Why couldnt we
have taken in enough wood to last the ten miles farther to the terminus
when we last stopped And why in thunder with all this firing up cant
we go faster

The younger passenger whose quiet wellbred face seemed to indicate
more discipline of character smiled

If you really wish to know and as weve only ten miles farther to
goIll show you WHY Come with me

He led the way through the car to the platform and leaped down Then he
pointed significantly to the rails below them His companion started
The metal was scaling off in thin strips from the rails and in some
places its thickness had been reduced a quarter of an inch while in
others the projecting edges were torn off or hanging in iron shreds
so that the wheels actually ran on the narrow central strip It seemed
marvelous that the train could keep the track

NOW you know why we dont go more than five miles an hour andare
thankful that we dont said the young traveler quietly

But this is disgracefulcriminal ejaculated the other nervously

Not at their rate of speed returned the younger man The crime would
be in going faster And now you can understand why a good deal of the
other progress in this State is obliged to go as slowly over their
equally decaying and rotten foundations You cant rush things here as
we do in the North

The other passenger shrugged his shoulders as they remounted the
platform and the train moved on It was not the first time that the two
fellowtravelers had differed although their mission was a common
one The elder Mr Cyrus Drummond was the vicepresident of a large
Northern land and mill company which had bought extensive tracts of
land in Georgia and the younger Colonel Courtland was the consulting
surveyor and engineer for the company Drummonds opinions were a good
deal affected by sectional prejudice and a selfsatisfied and righteous
ignorance of the actual conditions and limitations of the people with
whom he was to deal while the younger man who had served through the
war with distinction retained a soldiers respect and esteem for his
late antagonists with a conscientious and thoughtful observation of
their character Although he had resigned from the army the fact that
he had previously graduated at West Point with high honors had given
him preferment in this technical appointment and his knowledge of the
country and its people made him a valuable counselor And it was a fact
that the country people had preferred this soldier with whom they had
once personally grappled to the capitalist they had never known during
the struggle

The train rolled slowly through the woods so slowly that the fragrant
pine smoke from the engine still hung round the windows of the cars
Gradually the clearings became larger they saw the distant white
wooden colonnades of some planters house looking still opulent and
pretentious although the fence of its inclosure had broken gaps and
the gate sagged on its single hinge

Mr Drummond sniffed at this damning record of neglect and indifference
Even if they were ruined they might still have spent a few cents for
nails and slats to enable them to look decent before folks and not
parade their poverty before their neighbors he said

But thats just where you misunderstand them Drummond said
Courtland smiling They have no reason to keep up an attitude towards
their neighbors who still know them as Squire soandso Colonel
this and that and the Judgeowners of their vast but crippled
estates They are not ashamed of being poor which is an accident

But they are of working which is DELIBERATION interrupted Drummond
They are ashamed to mend their fences themselves now that they have no
slaves to do it for them

I doubt very much if some of them know how to drive a nail for the
matter of that said Courtland still goodhumoredly but thats
the fault of a system older than themselves which the founders of the
Republic retained We cannot give them experience in their new condition
in one day and in fact Drummond I am very much afraid that for our
purposesand I honestly believe for THEIR goodwe must help to keep
them for the present as they are

Perhaps said Drummond sarcastically you would like to reinstate
slavery

No But I should like to reinstate the MASTER And not for HIS sake
alone but for freedoms sake and OURS To be plain since I have taken
up this matter for the company I have satisfied myself from personal
observation that the negroeven more than his mastercannot handle his
new condition He is accustomed to his old traditional taskmaster and
I doubt if he will work fairly for any otherparticularly for those who
dont understand him Dont mistake me I dont propose to go back to
the whip to that brutal institution the irresponsible overseer to
the buying and selling and separation of the family nor any of the
old wrongs but I propose to make the old master OUR OVERSEER and
responsible to US He is not a fool and has already learned that it
is more profitable to pay wages to his old slaves and have the power
of dismissal like any other employer than be obliged under the old
system of enforced labor and life servitude to undergo the cost of
maintaining incompetence and idleness The old sentiment of slaveowning
has disappeared before natural commonsense and selfishness I am
satisfied that by some such process as this utilizing of the old master
and the new freedom we will be better able to cultivate our lands than
by buying up their estates and setting the old owners adrift with a
little money in their pockets as an idle discontented class to
revive old political dogmas and foment new issues or perhaps set up a
dangerous opposition to us

You dont mean to say that those infernal niggers would give the
preference to their old oppressors

Dollar for dollar in wagesyes And why shouldnt they Their old
masters understand them betterand treat them generally better They
know our interest in them is only an abstract sentiment not a real
liking We show it at every turn But we are nearing Redlands and Major
Reed will I have no doubt corroborate my impressions He insists upon
our staying at his house although the poor old fellow I imagine can
ill afford to entertain company But he will be offended if we refuse

He is a friend of yours then asked Drummond

I fought against his division at Stony Creek said Courtland grimly
He never tires of talking of it to meso I suppose I am

A few moments later the train glided beside the Redlands platform As
the two travelers descended a hand was laid on Courtlands shoulder and
a stout figure in the blackest and shiniest of alpaca jackets and the
whitest and broadest of Panama hats welcomed him Glad to see yo
cunnel I reckoned Id waltz over and bring along the boy pointing to
a grizzled negro servant of sixty who was bowing before them to
tote yor things over instead of using a hack I havent run much on
horseflesh since the wahha ha What I didnt use up for remounts I
reckon yor commissary gobbled up with the other live stock eh He
laughed heartily as if the recollections were purely humorous and
again clapped Courtland on the back

Let me introduce my friend Mr Drummond Major Reed said Courtland
smiling

Yo were in the wah sir

NoIreturned Drummond hesitating he knew not why and angry at
his own embarrassment

Mr Drummond the vicepresident of the company interposed Courtland
cheerfully was engaged in furnishing to us the sinews of war

Major Reed bowed a little more formally Most of us heah sir were
in the wah some time or other and if you gentlemen will honah me by
joining in a social glass at the hotel across the way Ill introduce
you to Captain Prendergast who left a leg at Fair Oaks Drummond would
have declined but a significant pressure on his arm from Courtland
changed his determination He followed them to the hotel and into the
presence of the onelegged warrior who turned out to be the landlord
and barkeeper to whom Courtland was hilariously introduced by Major
Reed as the man sir who had pounded my division for three hours at
Stony Creek

Major Reeds house was but a few minutes walk down the dusty lane
and was presently heralded by the baying of three or four foxhounds and
foreshadowed by a dilapidated condition of picketfence and stuccoed
gate front Beyond it stretched the wooden Doric columns of the
usual Southern mansion dimly seen through the broad leaves of the
horsechestnuttrees that shaded it There were the usual listless black
shadows haunting the veranda and outer officesformer slaves and still
attached houseservants arrested like lizards in breathless attitudes
at the approach of strange footsteps and still holding the brush
broom duster or home implement they had been lazily using in their
fixed hands From the doorway of the detached kitchen connected by a
gallery to the wing of the mansion Aunt Martha the cook gazed also
with a saucepan clasped to her bosom and her revolving hand with the
scrubbing cloth in it apparently stopped on a dead centre

Drummond whose gorge had risen at these evidences of hopeless
incapacity and utter shiftlessness was not relieved by the presence of
Mrs Reeda soured disappointed woman of forty who still carried in
her small dark eyes and thin handsome lips something of the bitterness
and antagonism of the typical Southern rights woman nor of her two
daughters Octavia and Augusta whose languid atrabiliousness seemed a
part of the mourning they still wore The optimistic gallantry and good
fellowship of the major appeared the more remarkable by contrast with
his cypressshadowed family and their venomous possibilities Perhaps
there might have been a light vein of Southern insincerity in his good
humor Paw said Miss Octavia with gloomy confidence to Courtland
but with a pretty curl of the hereditary lip is about the only
reconstructed one of the entire family We dont make em much about
yer But Id advise yo friend Mr Drummond if hes coming here
carpetbagging not to trust too much to paws reconstruction It
wont wash But when Courtland hastened to assure her that Drummond
was not a carpetbagger was not only free from any of the political
intrigue implied under that baleful title but was a wealthy Northern
capitalist simply seeking investment the young lady was scarcely more
hopeful I suppose he reckons to pay paw for those niggers yo stole
she suggested with gloomy sarcasm

No said Courtland smiling but what if he reckoned to pay those
niggers for working for your father and him

If paw is going into trading business with him if Major Reeda
Sothn gentlemanis going to keep shop he aint such a fool as to
believe niggers will work when they aint obliged to THATS been tried
over at Mirandy Dowss not five miles from here and the niggers are
half the time hangin round here takin holiday She put up new quarters
for em and tried to make em eat together at a long table like those
lowdown folks up North and did away with their cabins and their melon
patches and allowed it would get em out of lying round too much and
wanted em to work overtime and get mo pay And the result was that
she and her niece and a lot of poor whites Irish and Scotch that she
had to pick up long the river do all the work And her niece Sally
was mo than half Union woman during the wah and up to all Nothn
tricks and dodges and swearin by them and yet for all thatthe
thing wont work

But isnt that partly the reason Isnt her failure a great deal due to
this lack of sympathy from her neighbors Discontent is easily sown
and the negro is still weighted down by superstition the Fifteenth
Amendment did not quite knock off ALL his chains

Yes but that is nothing to HER For if there ever was a person in this
world who reckoned she was just born to manage everything and everybody
it is Sally Dows

Sally Dows repeated Courtland with a slight start

Yes Sally Dows of Pineville

You say she was half Union but did she have any relations
ororfriendsin the waron your side Anywhowere killed in
battle

They were all killed I reckon returned Miss Reed darkly There was
her cousin Jule Jeffcourt shot in the cemetery with her beau who
they say was Sallys too there were Chet Brooks and Joyce Masterton
who were both gone on her and both killed too and there was old Captain
Dows himself who never lifted his head again after Richmond was taken
and drank himself to death It wasnt considered healthy to be Miss
Sallys relations in those times or to be even wantin to be one

Colonel Courtland did not reply The face of the dead young officer
coming towards him out of the blue smoke rose as vividly as on that
memorable day The picture and letter he had taken from the dead mans
breast which he had retained ever since the romantic and fruitless
quest he had made for the fair original in after days and the strange
and fateful interest in her which had grown up in his heart since then
he now knew had only been lulled to sleep in the busy preoccupation of
the last six months for it all came back to him with redoubled force
His present mission and its practical object his honest zeal in its
pursuit and the cautious skill and experience he had brought to it
all seemed to be suddenly displaced by this romantic and unreal fantasy
Oddly enough it appeared now to be the only reality in his life the
rest was an incoherent purposeless dream

IsisMiss Sally married he asked collecting himself with an
effort

Married Yes to that farm of her aunts I reckon thats the only
thing she cares for

Courtland looked up recovering his usual cheerful calm Well I think
that after luncheon Ill pay my respects to her family From what you
have just told me the farm is certainly an experiment worth seeing I
suppose your father will have no objection to give me a letter to Miss
Dows


CHAPTER II


Nevertheless as Colonel Courtland rode deliberately towards Dows
Folly as the new experiment was locally called although he had not
abated his romantic enthusiasm in the least he was not sorry that he
was able to visit it under a practical pretext It was rather late now
to seek out Miss Sally Dows with the avowed intent of bringing her a
letter from an admirer who had been dead three years and whose memory
she had probably buried Neither was it tactful to recall a sentiment
which might have been a weakness of which she was ashamed Yet
clearheaded and logical as Courtland was in his ordinary affairs he
was nevertheless not entirely free from that peculiar superstition which
surrounds every mans romance He believed there was something more than
a mere coincidence in his unexpectedly finding himself in such favorable
conditions for making her acquaintance For the restif there was any
resthe would simply trust to fate And so believing himself a
cool sagacious reasoner but being actually as far as Miss Dows was
concerned as blind fatuous and unreasoning as any of her previous
admirers he rode complacently forward until he reached the lane that
led to the Dows plantation

Here a better kept roadway and fence whose careful repair would
have delighted Drummond seemed to augur well for the new enterprise
Presently even the oldfashioned local form of the fence a slanting
zigzag gave way to the more direct line of post and rail in the
Northern fashion Beyond it presently appeared a long low frontage of
modern buildings which to Courtlands surprise were entirely new in
structure and design There was no reminiscence of the usual Southern
porticoed gable or columned veranda Yet it was not Northern either The
factorylike outline of facade was partly hidden in Cherokee rose and
jessamine

A long roofed gallery connected the buildings and became a veranda to
one A broad wellrolled gravel drive led from the open gate to the
newest building which seemed to be the office a smaller path diverged
from it to the corner house which despite its severe simplicity had a
more residential appearance Unlike Reeds house there were no lounging
servants or field hands to be seen they were evidently attending to
their respective duties Dismounting Courtland tied his horse to a post
at the office door and took the smaller path to the corner house

The door was open to the fragrant afternoon breeze wafted through the
rose and jessamine So also was a side door opening from the hall into
a long parlor or sittingroom that ran the whole width of the house
Courtland entered it It was prettily furnished but everything had the
air of freshness and of being uncharacteristically new It was empty
but a faint hammering was audible on the rear wall of the house through
the two open French windows at the back curtained with trailing vines
which gave upon a sunlit courtyard Courtland walked to the window Just
before it on the ground stood a small light ladder which he gently
put aside to gain a better view of the courtyard as he put on his hat
and stepped out of the open window

In this attitude he suddenly felt his hat tipped from his head followed
almost instantaneously by a falling slipper and the distinct impression
of a very small foot on the crown of his head An indescribable
sensation passed over him He hurriedly stepped back into the room just
as a small stripedstockinged foot was as hastily drawn up above the top
of the window with the feminine exclamation Good gracious me

Lingering for an instant only to assure himself that the fair speaker
had secured her foothold and was in no danger of falling Courtland
snatched up his hat which had providentially fallen inside the room
and retreated ingloriously to the other end of the parlor The voice
came again from the window and struck him as being very sweet and
clear

Sophy is that YOU

Courtland discreetly retired to the hall To his great relief a voice
from the outside answered Whar Miss Sally

What did yo move the ladder for Yo might have killed me

Fo God Miss Sally I didnt move no ladder

Dont tell me but go down and get my slipper And bring up some more
nails

Courtland waited silently in the hall In a few moments he heard a heavy
footstep outside the rear window This was his opportunity Reentering
the parlor somewhat ostentatiously he confronted a tall negro girl
who was passing through the room carrying a tiny slipper in her hand
Excuse me he said politely but I could not find any one to announce
me Is Miss Dows at home

The girl instantly whipped the slipper behind her Is yo wanting Miss
Mirandy Dows she asked with great dignity oah Miss Sally Dowsher
niece Miss Mirandys bin gone to Atlanta for a week

I have a letter for Miss Miranda but I shall be very glad if Miss
Sally Dows will receive me returned Courtland handing the letter and
his card to the girl

She received it with a still greater access of dignity and marked
deliberation Its clean gone outer my mind sah ef Miss Sally is in
de resumption of visitahs at dis houah In fac sah she continued
with intensified gravity and an exaggeration of thoughtfulness as the
sounds of Miss Sallys hammering came shamelessly from the wall I
doahn know exacly ef shes engaged playin de harp practicin de
languages or paintin in oil and watah colors o givin audiences to
offishals from de Court House It might be de houah for de one or de
odder But Ill communicate wid her sah in de budwoh on de uppah
flo She backed dexterously so as to keep the slipper behind her but
with no diminution of dignity out of a side door In another moment the
hammering ceased followed by the sound of rapid whispering without a
few tiny twigs and leaves slowly rustled to the ground and then there
was complete silence He ventured to walk to the fateful window again

Presently he heard a faint rustle at the other end of the room and he
turned A sudden tremulousness swept along his pulses and then they
seemed to pause he drew a deep breath that was almost a sigh and
remained motionless

He had no preconceived idea of falling in love with Miss Sally at first
sight nor had he dreamed such a thing possible Even the girlish face
that he had seen in the locket although it had stirred him with a
singular emotion had not suggested that And the ideal he had evolved
from it was never a potent presence But the exquisitely pretty face
and figure before him although it might have been painted from his own
fancy of her was still something more and something unexpected All
that had gone before had never prepared him for the beautiful girl who
now stood there It was a poor explanation to say that Miss Sally was
four or five years older than her picture and that later experiences
enlarged capacity a different life and new ambition had impressed her
youthful face with a refined mobility it was a weird fancy to imagine
that the blood of those who had died for her had in some vague
mysterious way imparted an actual fascination to her and he dismissed
it But even the most familiar spectator like Sophy could see that
Miss Sally had the softest pink complexion the silkiest hair that
looked as the floss of the Indian corn might look if curled or golden
spider threads if materialized and eyes that were in bright gray
harmony with both that the frock of India muslin albeit homemade
fitted her figure perfectly from the azure bows on her shoulders to the
ribbon around her waist and that the hem of its billowy skirt showed a
foot which had the reputation of being the smallest foot south of Mason
and Dixons Line But it was something more intangible than this which
kept Courtland breathless and silent

Im not Miss Miranda Dows said the vision with a frankness that was
half childlike and half practical as she extended a little hand but I
can talk fahm with yo about as well as aunty and I reckon from what
Major Reed says heah holding up the letter between her fingers as
long as yo get the persimmons yo dont mind what kind o pole yo
knock em down with

The voice that carried this speech was so fresh clear and sweet that I
am afraid Courtland thought little of its bluntness or its conventional
transgressions But it brought him his own tongue quite unemotionally
and quietly I dont know what was in that note Miss Dows but I can
hardly believe that Major Reed ever put my present felicity quite in
that way

Miss Sally laughed Then with a charming exaggeration she waved her
little hand towards the sofa

There Yo naturally wanted a little room for that connle but now
that yo ve got it offand mighty pooty it was tooyo can sit
down And with that she sank down at one end of the sofa prettily drew
aside a white billow of skirt so as to leave ample room for Courtland
at the other and clasping her fingers over her knees looked demurely
expectant

But let me hope that I am not disturbing you unseasonably said
Courtland catching sight of the fateful little slipper beneath her
skirt and remembering the window I was so preoccupied in thinking of
your aunt as the business manager of these estates that I quite forget
that she might have a ladys hours for receiving

We havent got any company hours said Miss Sally and we havent
just now any servants for company manners for were shorthanded in the
fields and barns When yo came I was nailing up the laths for the vines
outside because we couldnt spare carpenters from the factory But
she added with a faint accession of mischief in her voice yo came to
talk about the fahm

Yes said Courtland rising but not to interrupt the work on it
Will you let me help you nail up the laths on the wall I have some
experience that way and we can talk as we work Do oblige me

The young girl looked at him brightly

Well now theres nothing mean about THAT Yo mean it for sure

Perfectly I shall feel so much less as if I was enjoying your company
under false pretenses

Yo just wait here then

She jumped from the sofa ran out of the room and returned presently
tying the string of a long striped cotton blouseevidently an extra one
of Sophysbehind her back as she returned It was gathered under her
oval chin by a tape also tied behind her while her fair hair was tucked
under the usual red bandana handkerchief of the negro housemaid It is
scarcely necessary to add that the effect was bewitching

But said Miss Sally eying her guests smartly fitting frockcoat
yo ll spoil yor pooty clothes sure Take off yor coatdont mind
meand work in yor shirtsleeves

Courtland obediently flung aside his coat and followed his active
hostess through the French window to the platform outside Above them a
wooden ledge or cornice projecting several inches ran the whole length
of the building It was on this that Miss Sally had evidently found a
foothold while she was nailing up a trelliswork of laths between it and
the windows of the second floor Courtland found the ladder mounted
to the ledge followed by the young girl who smilingly waived his
proffered hand to help her up and the two gravely set to work But in
the intervals of hammering and tying up the vines Miss Sallys tongue
was not idle Her talk was as fresh as quaint as original as herself
and yet so practical and to the purpose of Courtlands visit as to
excuse his delight in it and her own fascinating propinquity Whether
she stopped to take a nail from between her pretty lips when she spoke
to him or whether holding on perilously with one hand to the trellis
while she gesticulated with the hammer pointing out the divisions of
the plantation from her coign of vantage he thought she was as clear
and convincing to his intellect as she was distracting to his senses

She told him how the war had broken up their old home in Pineville
sending her father to serve in the Confederate councils of Richmond
and leaving her aunt and herself to manage the property alone how the
estate had been devastated the house destroyed and how they had
barely time to remove a few valuables how although SHE had always been
opposed to secession and the war she had not gone North preferring to
stay with her people and take with them the punishment of the folly she
had foreseen How after the war and her fathers death she and her aunt
had determined to reconstruct THEMSELVES after their own fashion on
this bit of property which had survived their fortunes because it had
always been considered valueless and unprofitable for negro labor How
at first they had undergone serious difficulty through the incompetence
and ignorance of the freed laborer and the equal apathy and prejudice
of their neighbors How they had gradually succeeded with the adoption
of new methods and ideas that she herself had conceived which she now
briefly and clearly stated Courtland listened with a new breathless
and almost superstitious interest they were HIS OWN THEORIESperfected
and demonstrated

But you must have had capital for this

Ah yes that was where they were fortunate There were some French
cousins with whom she had once stayed in Paris who advanced enough to
stock the estate There were some English friends of her fathers old
blockade runners who had taken shares provided them with more capital
and imported some skilled laborers and a kind of steward or agent to
represent them But they were getting on and perhaps it was better for
their reputation with their neighbors that they had not been BEHOLDEN to
the Noth Seeing a cloud pass over Courtlands face the young lady
added with an affected sigh and the first touch of feminine coquetry
which had invaded their wholesome camaraderie

Yo ought to have found us out BEFORE connle

For an impulsive moment Courtland felt like telling her then and there
the story of his romantic quest but the reflection that they were
standing on a narrow ledge with no room for the emotions and that Miss
Sally had just put a nail in her mouth and a start might be dangerous
checked him To this may be added a new jealousy of her previous
experiences which he had not felt before Nevertheless he managed to
say with some effusion

But I hope we are not too late NOW I think my principals are quite
ready and able to buy up any English or French investor now or to come

Yo might try yo hand on that one said Miss Sally pointing to a
young fellow who had just emerged from the office and was crossing the
courtyard Hes the English agent

He was squareshouldered and roundheaded fresh and clean looking in
his white flannels but with an air of being utterly distinct and alien
to everything around him and mentally and morally irreconcilable to it
As he passed the house he glanced shyly at it his eye brightened and
his manner became selfconscious as he caught sight of the young girl
but changed again when he saw her companion Courtland likewise was
conscious of a certain uneasiness it was one thing to be helping Miss
Sally ALONE but certainly another thing to be doing so under the eye
of a stranger and I am afraid that he met the stony observation of the
Englishman with an equally cold stare Miss Sally alone retained her
languid ease and selfpossession She called out Wait a moment Mr
Champney slipped lightly down the ladder and leaning against it with
one foot on its lowest rung awaited his approach

I reckoned yo might be passing by she said as he came forward
Connle Courtland with an explanatory wave of the hammer towards her
companion who remained erect and slightly stiffened on the cornice
is no relation to those figures along the frieze of the Redlands Court
House but a Nothn officer a friend of Major Reeds whos come down
here to look after Sothn property for some Nothn capitalists Mr
Champney she continued turning and lifting her eyes to Courtland as
she indicated Champney with her hammer when he isnt talking English
seeing English thinking English dressing English and wondering why
God didnt make everything English is trying to do the same for
HIS folks Mr Champney Connle Courtland Connle Courtland Mr
Champney The two men bowed formally And now Connle if yoll
come down Mr Champney will show yo round the fahm When yo ve got
through yoll find me here at work

Courtland would have preferred and half looked for her company
and commentary on this round of inspection but he concealed his
disappointment and descended It did not exactly please him that
Champney seemed relieved and appeared to accept him as a bona fide
stranger who could not possibly interfere with any confidential
relations that he might have with Miss Sally Nevertheless he met the
Englishmans offer to accompany him with polite gratitude and they left
the house together

In less than an hour they returned It had not even taken that time for
Courtland to discover that the real improvements and the new methods
had originated with Miss Sally that she was virtually the controlling
influence there and that she was probably retarded rather than assisted
by the oldfashioned and traditional conservatism of the company of
which Champney was steward It was equally plain however that the
young fellow was dimly conscious of this and was frankly communicative
about it

You see over there they work things in a different way and by Jove
they cant understand that there is any other dont you know Theyre
always wigging me as if I could help it although Ive tried to explain
the nigger business and all that dont you know They want Miss Dows
to refer her plans to me and expect me to report on them and then
theyll submit them to the Board and wait for its decision Fancy Miss
Dows doing that But by Jove they cant conceive of her AT ALL over
there dont you know

Which Miss Dows do you mean asked Courtland dryly

Miss Sally of course said the young fellow briskly SHE manages
everythingher aunt included She can make those niggers work when no
one else can a word or smile from her is enough She can make terms
with dealers and contractorsher own terms toowhen they wont look
at MY figures By Jove she even gets points out of those traveling
agents and inventors dont you know who come along the road with
patents and samples She got one of those lightningrod and wirefence
men to show her how to put up an arbor for her trailing roses Why when
I first saw YOU up on the cornice I thought you were some other chap
that shed askeddont you knowthat is at first of courseyou
know what I meanha by Jovebefore we were introduced dont you
know

I think I OFFERED to help Miss Dows said Courtland with a quickness
that he at once regretted

So did HE dont you know Miss Sally does not ASK anybody Dont you
see a fellow dont like to stand by and see a young lady like her doing
such work Vaguely aware of some infelicity in his speech he awkwardly
turned the subject I dont think I shall stay here long myself

You expect to return to England asked Courtland

Oh no But I shall go out of the companys service and try my own
hand Theres a good bit of land about three miles from here thats in
the market and I think I could make something out of it A fellow ought
to settle down and be his own master he answered tentatively eh

But how will Miss Dows be able to spare you asked Courtland uneasily
conscious that he was assuming an indifference

Oh Im not much use to her dont you knowat least not HERE But
I might if I had my own land and if we were neighbors I told you SHE
runs the place no matter whos here or whose money is invested

I presume you are speaking now of young Miss Dows said Courtland
dryly

Miss Sallyof coursealways said Champney simply She runs the
shop

Were there not some French investorsrelations of Miss Dows Does
anybody represent THEM asked Courtland pointedly

Yet he was not quite prepared for the naive change in his companions
face No There was a sort of French cousin who used to be a good deal
to the fore dont you know But I rather fancy he didnt come here to
look after the PROPERTY returned Champney with a quick laugh I think
the aunt must have written to his friends for they called him off
and I dont think Miss Sally broke her heart about him Shes not that
sort of girleh She could have her pick of the State if she went in
for that sort of thingeh

Although this was exactly what Courtland was thinking it pleased him
to answer in a distrait sort of fashion Certainly I should think so
and to relapse into an apparently business abstraction

I think I wont go in continued Champney as they neared the house
again I suppose youll have something more to say to Miss Dows If
theres anything else you want of ME come to the office But SHELL
know Andererif youreerstaying long in this part of the
country ride over and look me up dont you know and have a smoke
and a julep I have a boy who knows how to mix them and Ive some old
brandy sent me from the other side Goodby

More awkward in his kindliness than in his simple business confidences
but apparently equally honest in both he shook Courtlands hand and
walked away Courtland turned towards the house He had seen the farm
and its improvements he had found some of his own ideas practically
discounted clearly there was nothing left for him to do but to thank
his hostess and take his leave But he felt far more uneasy than when
he had arrived and there was a singular sense of incompleteness in
his visit that he could not entirely account for His conversation with
Champney had complicatedhe knew not whyhis previous theories of Miss
Dows and although he was half conscious that this had nothing to do
with the business that brought him there he tried to think that it had
If Miss Sally was reallyaadistracting element to contiguous man
it was certainly something to be considered in a matter of business of
which she would take a managerial part It was true that Champney had
said she was not that sort of girl but this was the testimony of one
who was clearly under her influence He entered the house through the
open French window The parlor was deserted He walked through the front
hall and porch no one was there He lingered a few moments a slight
chagrin beginning to mingle with his uneasiness She might have been on
the lookout for him She or Sophy must have seen him returning He would
ring for Sophy and leave his thanks and regrets for her mistress
He looked for a bell touched it but on being confronted with Sophy
changed his mind and asked to SEE Miss Dows In the interval between her
departure and the appearance of Miss Sally he resolved to do the very
thing which he had dismissed from his thoughts but an hour before as
illtimed and doubtful He had the photograph and letter in his pocket
he would make them his excuse for personally taking leave of her

She entered with her fair eyebrows lifted in a pretty surprise

I declare to goodness I thought yo d ridden over to the red barn and
gone home from there I got through my work on the vines earlier than
I thought One of Judge Garrets nephews dropped in in time to help me
with the last row Yo neednt have troubled yoself to send up for me
for mere company manners but Sophy says yo looked sort of anxious and
particular when yo asked for meso I suppose yo want to see me for
something

Mentally objurgating Sophy and with an unpleasant impression in his
mind of the unknown neighbor who had been helping Miss Sally in his
place he nevertheless tried to collect himself gallantly

I dont know what my expression conveyed to Sophy he said with a
smile but I trust that what I have to tell you may be interesting
enough to make you forget my second intrusion He paused and still
smiling continued For more than three years Miss Dows you have more
or less occupied my thoughts and although we have actually met today
only for the first time I have during that time carried your image
with me constantly Even this meeting which was only the result of an
accident I had been seeking for three years I find you here under your
own peaceful vine and figtree and yet three years ago you came to me
out of the thundercloud of battle

My good gracious said Miss Sally

She had been clasping her knee with her linked fingers but separated
them and leaned backward on the sofa with affected consternation but
an expression of growing amusement in her bright eyes Courtland saw the
mistake of his tone but it was too late to change it now He handed
her the locket and the letter and briefly and perhaps a little more
seriously recounted the incident that had put him in possession of
them But he entirely suppressed the more dramatic and ghastly details
and his own superstition and strange prepossession towards her

Miss Sally took the articles without a tremor or the least deepening
or paling of the delicate faint suffusion of her cheek When she had
glanced over the letter which appeared to be brief she said with
smiling halfpitying tranquillity

Yesit WAS that poor Chet Brooks sure I heard that he was killed
at Snake River It was just like him to rush in and get killed the first
pop And all for nothing toopure foolishness

Shocked yet relieved but uneasy under both sensations Courtland went
on blindly

But he was not the only one Miss Dows There was another man picked up
who also had your picture

YesJoyce Masterton They sent it to me But you didnt kill HIM
too

I dont know that I personally killed either he said a little coldly
He paused and continued with a gravity which he could not help feeling
very inconsistent and even ludicrous They were brave men Miss Dows

To have worn my picture said Miss Sally brightly

To have THOUGHT they had so much to live for and yet to have willingly
laid down their lives for what they believed was right

Yo didnt go huntin me for three years to tell ME a Sothn girl
that Sothn men know how to fight did yo connle returned the
young lady with the slightest lifting of her head and drooping of her
blueveined lids in a divine hauteur They were always ready enough for
that even among themselves It was much easier for these pooah boys to
fight a thing out than think it out or work it out Yo folks in the
Noth learned to do all three thats where you got the grip on us Yo
look surprised connle

I didnt expect you would look at itquite ininthat way said
Courtland awkwardly

I am sorry I disappointed yo after yo d taken such a heap o
trouble returned the young lady with a puzzling assumption of humility
as she rose and smoothed out her skirts but I couldnt know exactly
what yo might be expecting after three years if I HAD I might have
put on moning She stopped and adjusted a straying tendril of her hair
with the sharp corner of the dead mans letter But I thank yo all
the same connle It was real good in yo to think of toting these
things over here And she held out her hand frankly

Courtland took it with the sickening consciousness that for the last
five minutes he had been an unconscionable ass He could not prolong the
interview after she had so significantly risen If he had only taken
his leave and kept the letter and locket for a later visit perhaps when
they were older friends It was too late now He bent over her hand for
a moment again thanked her for her courtesy and withdrew A moment
later she heard the receding beat of his horses hoofs on the road

She opened the drawer of a brasshandled cabinet and after a moments
critical survey of her picture in the dead mans locket tossed it and
the letter into the recesses of the drawer Then she stopped removed
her little slipper from her foot looked at THAT too thoughtfully and
called Sophy

Miss Sally said the girl reappearing at the door

Are you sure you did not move that ladder

I clare to goodness Miss Sally I never teched it

Miss Sally directed a critical glance at her handmaidens redcoifed
head No she said to herself softly it felt nicer than wool
anyway


CHAPTER III


In spite of the awkward termination of his visitor perhaps BECAUSE of
itCourtland called again at the plantation within the week But this
time he was accompanied by Drummond and was received by Miss Miranda
Dows a tall aquilinenosed spinster of fifty whose oldtime
politeness had become slightly affected and whose old beliefs had given
way to a halfcynical acceptance of new facts Mr Drummond delighted
with the farm and its management was no less fascinated by Miss Sally
while Courtland was now discreet enough to divide his attentions between
her and her aunt with the result that he was far from participating in
Champneys conviction of Miss Mirandas unimportance To the freedmen
she still represented the old implacable taskmistress and it was
evident that they superstitiously believed that she still retained a
vague power of overriding the Fourteenth Amendment at her pleasure
and was only to be restrained by the mediation of the goodhumored
and sensible Miss Sally Courtland was quick to see the value of this
influence in the transition state of the freedmen and pointed it out
to his principal Drummonds previous doubts and skepticism already
weakened by Miss Sallys fascinations vanished entirely at this
prospect of beneficially utilizing these lingering evils of slavery He
was convinced he was even enthusiastic The foreign investors were men
to be bought out the estate improved and enlarged by the company
and the fair owners retained in the management and control Like most
prejudiced men Drummonds conversion was sudden and extreme and being
a practical man was at once acted upon At a second and third interview
the preliminaries were arranged and in three weeks from Courtlands
first visit the Dows plantation and part of Major Reeds were merged
in the Drummond Syndicate and placed beyond financial uncertainty
Courtland remained to represent the company as superintendent at
Redlands and with the transfer of the English investments Champney
retired as he had suggested to a smaller venture of his own on a
plantation a few miles distant which the company had been unable to
secure

During this interval Courtland had frequent interviews with Miss Sally
and easy and unrestrained access to her presence He had never again
erred on the side of romance or emotion he had never again referred to
the infelix letter and photograph and without being obliged to confine
himself strictly to business affairs he had maintained an even quiet
neighborly intercourse with her Much of this was the result of his own
selfcontrol and soldierly training and gave little indication of the
deeper feeling that he was conscious lay beneath it At times he caught
the young girls eyes fixed upon him with a mischievous curiosity A
strange thrill went through him there are few situations so subtle and
dangerous as the accidental confidences and understandings of two young
people of opposite sex even though the question of any sentimental
inclination be still in abeyance Courtland knew that Miss Sally
remembered the too serious attitude he had taken towards her past She
might laugh at it and even resent it but she KNEW it remembered
it knew that HE did and this precious knowledge was confined to
themselves It was in their minds when there was a pause in their more
practical and conventional conversation and was even revealed in the
excessive care which Miss Sally later took to avert at the right moment
her mischievously smiling eyes Once she went farther Courtland had
just finished explaining to her a plan for substituting small farm
buildings for the usual halfcultivated gardenpatches dear to the negro
fieldhand and had laid down the drawings on the table in the office
when the young lady leaning against it with her hands behind her fixed
her bright gray eyes on his serious face

I vow and protest connle she said dropping into one of the quaint
survivals of an oldtime phraseology peculiar to her people I never
allowed yo could just give yoself up to business soul and body as
yo do when I first met yo that day

Why what did you think me he asked quickly

Miss Sally who had a Southern aptitude for gesture took one little
hand from behind her twirled it above her head with a pretty air of
disposing of some airy nothing in a presumably masculine fashion and
said Oh THAT

I am afraid I did not impress you then as a very practical man he
said with a faint color

I thought you roosted rather high connle to pick up many worms in
the moning But she added with a dazzling smile I reckon from what
yo said about the photograph yo thought I wasnt exactly what yo
believed I ought to be either

He would have liked to tell her then and there that he would have been
content if those bright beautiful eyes had never kindled with anything
but love or womanly aspiration that that soft lazy caressing voice
had never been lifted beyond the fireside or domestic circle that the
sunny tendriled hair and pink ears had never inclined to anything but
whispered admiration and that the graceful lithe erect figure so
independent and selfcontained had been satisfied to lean only upon his
arm for support He was conscious that this had been in his mind when he
first saw her he was equally conscious that she was more bewilderingly
fascinating to him in her present inaccessible intelligence and
practicality

I confess he said looking into her eyes with a vague smile I did
not expect you would be so forgetful of some one who had evidently cared
for you

Meaning Mr Chet Brooks or Mr Joyce Masterton or both Thats like
most yo men connle Yo reckon because a girl pleases yo she ought
to be grateful all her lifeand yors too Yo think different
now But yo neednt act up to it quite so much She made a little
deprecating gesture with her disengaged hand as if to ward off any
retaliating gallantry I aint speaking for myself connle Yo and me
are good enough friends But the girls round here think yo re a trifle
too much taken up with rice and niggers And looking at it even in yor
light connle it aint BUSINESS Yo want to keep straight with Major
Reed so it would be just as well to square the majors woman folks
Tavy and Gussie Reed aint exactly poisonous connle and yo might see
one or the other home from church next Sunday The Sunday after that
just to show yo aint particular and that yo go in for being a
regular beau yo might walk home with ME Dont be frightenedIve got
a better gown than this Its a new one just come home from Louisville
and Ill wear it for the occasion

He did not dare to say that the quaint frock she was then wearinga
plain checked household gingham used for childrens pinafores with
its ribbons of the same pattern gathered in bows at the smart apron
pocketshad become a part of her beauty for he was already hopelessly
conscious that she was lovely in anything and he might be impelled to
say so He thanked her gravely and earnestly but without gallantry or
effusion and had the satisfaction of seeing the mischief in her eyes
increase in proportion to his seriousness and heard her say with
affected concern Bear up connle Dont let it worry yo till the
time comes and took his leave

On the following Sunday he was present at the Redlands Episcopal Church
and after the service stood with outward composure but some inward
chafing among the gallant youth who after the local fashion had ranged
themselves outside the doors of the building He was somewhat surprised
to find Mr Champney evidently as much out of place as himself but
less selfcontained waiting in the crowd of expectant cavaliers
Although convinced that the young Englishman had come only to see Miss
Sally he was glad to share his awkward isolation with another stranger
and greeted him pleasantly The Dows pew being nearer to the entrance
than the Reeds gave up its occupants first Colonel Courtland lifted
his hat to Miss Miranda and her niece at the same moment that Champney
moved forward and ranged himself beside them Miss Sally catching
Courtlands eye showed the whites of her own in a backward glance of
mischievous significance to indicate the following Reeds When they
approached Courtland joined them and finding himself beside Miss
Octavia entered into conversation Apparently the suppressed passion
and sardonic melancholy of that darkeyed young lady spurred him to a
lighter gayer humor even in proportion as Miss Sallys goodnatured
levity and sunny practicality always made him serious They presently
fell to the rear with other couples and were soon quite alone

A little haughty but tall and erect in her wellpreserved black
grenadine dress which gave her the appearance of a youthful but
implacable widow Miss Reed declared she had not seen the connle for
a coons age and certainly had not expected to have the honor of his
company as long as there were niggers to be elevated or painted to look
like white men She hoped that he and paw and Sally Dows were happy
They hadnt yet got so far as to put up a nigger preacher in the place
of Mr Symes their rector but she understood that there was some talk
of running Hannibal JohnsonMiss Dows coachmanfor county judge next
year No she had not heard that the connle HIMSELF had thought of
running for the office He might laugh at her as much as he likedhe
seemed to be in better spirits than when she first saw himonly she
would like to know if it was Nothn style to laugh coming home
from church Of course if it WAS she would have to adopt it with the
Fourteenth Amendment But just now she noticed the folks were staring
at them and Miss Sally Dows had turned round to look Nevertheless
Miss Octavias sallow cheek nearest the colonelthe sunny sidehad
taken a faint brunettes flush and the corners of her proud mouth were
slightly lifted

But candidly Miss Reed dont you think that you would prefer to
have old Hannibal whom you know as county judge than a stranger and a
Northern man like ME

Miss Reeds dark eyes glanced sideways at the handsome face and elegant
figure beside her Something like a saucy smile struggled to her thin
lips

There mightnt be much to choose Connle

I admit it We should both acknowledge our mistress and be like wax in
her hands

Yo ought to make that pooty speech to Sally Dows shes generally
mistress around here But she added suddenly fixing her eyes on him
how does it happen that yo aint walking with her instead of that
Englishman Yo know that its as plain as day that he took that land
over there just to be near her when he was no longer agent

But Courtland was always master of himself and quite at ease regarding
Miss Sally when not in that ladys presence You forget he said
smilingly that Im still a stranger and knew little of the local
gossip and if I did know it I am afraid we didnt bargain to buy up
with the LAND Mr Champneys personal interest in the LANDLADY

Yo d have had your hands full for I reckon shes pooty heavily
mortgaged in that fashion already returned Miss Reed with mere
badinage than spitefulness in the suggestion And Mr Champney was run
pooty close by a French cousin of hers when he was here Yo havent got
any French books to lend me connlehave yo Paw says you read a heap
of French and I find it mighty hard to keep up MY practice since I
left the Convent at St Louis for paw dont knew what sort of books to
order and I reckon he makes awful mistakes sometimes

The conversation here turning upon polite literature it appeared that
Miss Octavias French reading through a shy proud innocence and
an imperfect knowledge of the wicked subtleties of the language was
somewhat broad and unconventional for a young lady Courtland promised
to send her some books and even ventured to suggest some American and
English novels not intensely Nothn nor metaphysicalaccording
to the accepted Southern beliefs A new respect and pitying interest
in this sullen solitary girl cramped by tradition and bruised rather
than enlightened by sad experiences came over him He found himself
talking quite confidentially to the lifted head arched eyebrows and
aquiline nose beside him and even thinking what a handsome highbred
BROTHER she might have been to some one When they had reached the
house in compliance with the familiar custom he sat down on one of
the lower steps of the veranda while she shaking out her skirt took a
seat a step or two above him This enabled him after the languid local
fashion to lean on his elbow and gaze up into the eyes of the young
lady while she with equal languor looked down upon him But in the
present instance Miss Reed leaned forward suddenly and darting a sharp
quick glance into his very consciousness said

And yo mean to say connle theres nothing between yo and Sally
Dows

Courtland neither flushed trembled grew confused nor prevaricated

We are good friends I think he replied quietly without evasion or
hesitation

Miss Reed looked at him thoughtfully I reckon that is soand no more
And thats why yo ve been so lucky in everything she said slowly

I dont think I quite understand returned Courtland smiling Is
this a paradoxor a consolation

Its the TRUTH said Miss Reed gravely Those who try to be anything
more to Sally Dows lose their luck

That isare rejected by her Is she really so relentless continued
Courtland gayly

I mean that they lose their luck in everything Something is sure to
happen And SHE cant help it either

Is this a Sibylline warning Miss Reed

No Its nigger superstition It came from Mammy Judy Sallys old
nurse Its part of their regular Hoodoo She bewitched Miss Sally when
she was a baby so that everybody is bound to HER as long as they care
for her and she isnt bound to THEM in any way All their luck goes to
her as soon as the spell is on them she added darkly

I think I know the rest returned Courtland with still greater
solemnity You gather the buds of the witchhazel in April when the
moon is full You then pluck three hairs from the young ladys right
eyebrow when she isnt looking

Yo can laugh connle for yo re luckybecause yo re free

Im not so sure of that he said gallantly for I ought to be riding
at this moment over to the Infirmary to visit my Sunday sick If being
made to pleasantly forget ones time and duty is a sign of witchcraft
I am afraid Mammy Judys enchantments were not confined to only one
Southern young lady

The sound of quick footsteps on the gravel path caused them both to look
up A surly looking young fellow ostentatiously booted and spurred
and carrying a heavy rawhide ridingwhip in his swinging hand was
approaching them Deliberately yet with uneasy selfconsciousness
ignoring the presence of Courtland he nodded abruptly to Miss Reed
ascended the steps brushed past them both without pausing and entered
the house

Is that yor manners Mr Tom called the young lady after him
a slight flush rising to her sallow cheek The young man muttered
something from the hall which Courtland did not catch Its Cousin Tom
Higbee she explained half disdainfully Hes had some ugliness with
his horse I reckon but paw ought to teach him how to behave AndI
dont think he likes Nothn men she added gravely

Courtland who had kept his temper with his full understanding of the
intruders meaning smiled as he took Miss Reeds hand in parting
Thats quite enough explanation and I dont know why it shouldnt be
even an apology

Yet the incident left little impression on him as he strolled back to
Redlands It was not the first time he had tasted the dregs of former
sectional hatred in incivility and discourtesy but as it seldom came
from his old personal antagoniststhe soldiersand was confined to the
callow youth previous noncombatants and politicians he could afford
to overlook it He did not see Miss Sally during the following week


CHAPTER IV


On the next Sunday he was early at church But he had perhaps
accented the occasion by driving there in a light buggy behind a fast
thoroughbred possibly selected more to the taste of a smart cavalry
officer than an agricultural superintendent He was already in a side
pew his eyes dreamily fixed on the prayerbook ledge before him when
there was a rustle at the church door and a thrill of curiosity and
admiration passed over the expectant congregation It was the entrance
of the Dows party Miss Sally well to the fore She was in her new
clothes the latest fashion in Louisville the latest but two in Paris
and New York

It was over twenty years ago I shall not imperil the effect of that
lovely vision by recalling to the eye of today a fashion of yesterday
Enough that it enabled her to set her sweet face and vapory golden hair
in a horseshoe frame of delicate flowers and to lift her oval chin
out of a bewildering mist of tulle Nor did a certain light polonaise
conceal the outlines of her charming figure Even those who were
constrained to whisper to each other that Miss Sally must be now
going on twentyfive did so because she still carried the slender
graces of seventeen The organ swelled as if to welcome her as she took
her seat a ray of sunlight that would have been cruel and searching to
any other complexion drifted across the faint pink of her cheeks
and nestling in her nebulous hair became itself transfigured A few
stainedglass Virtues on the windows did not come out of this effulgence
as triumphantly and it was small wonder that the devotional eyes of the
worshipers wandered from them to the face of Sally Dows

When the service was over as the congregation filed slowly into the
aisle Courtland slipped mutely behind her As she reached the porch he
said in an undertone

I brought my horse and buggy I thought you might possibly allow me
to driveBut he was stopped by a distressful knitting of her golden
brows No she said quickly but firmly you must notit wont do
As Courtland hesitated in momentary perplexity she smiled sweetly
Well walk round by the cemetery if you like it will take about as
long as a drive Courtland vanished gave hurried instructions and a
dollar to a lounging negro and rejoined Miss Sally as the delighted and
proud freedman drove out of the gate Miss Sally heaved a slight sigh
as the gallant equipage passed It was a mighty pooty turnout connle
and Id have just admired to go but it would have been rather hard on
the other folks Theres the Reeds and Maxwells and Robertsons that are
too pooah to keep blood horses and too proud to ride behind anything
else It wouldnt be the right thing for us to go whirling by
scattering our dust over them There was something so subtly pleasant
in this implied partnership of responsibility that Courtland forgot
the abrupt refusal and thought only of the tact that prompted it
Nevertheless here a spell seemed to fall upon his usually ready speech
Now that they were together for the first time in a distinctly social
fashion he found himself vacantly meaninglessly silent content to
walk beside this charming summery presence brushed by its delicate
draperies and inhaling its freshness Presently it spoke

It would take more than a thousand feet of lumber to patch up the
cowsheds beyond the Moseley pasture and an entirely new building with
an improved dairy would require only about two thousand more All the
old material would come in good for fencing and could be used with
the new post and rails Dont yo think it would be better to have an
outandout new building

Yes certainly returned Courtland a little confusedly He had
not calculated upon this practical conversation and was the more
disconcerted as they were passing some of the other couples who had
purposely lingered to overhear them

And continued the young girl brightly the freight question is
getting to be a pretty serious one Aunt Miranda holds some shares in
the Briggsville branch line and thinks something could be done with
the directors for a new tariff of charges if she put a pressure on them
Tyler says that there was some talk of their reducing it one sixteenth
per cent before we move this years crop

Courtland glanced quickly at his companions face It was grave but
there was the faintest wrinkling of the corner of the eyelid nearest
him Had we not better leave these serious questions until tomorrow
he said smiling

Miss Sally opened her eyes demurely Why yo seemed SO quiet I
reckoned yo must be full of business this morning but if yo prefer
company talk well change the subject They say that yo and Miss Reed
didnt have much trouble to find one last Sunday She dont usually talk
much but she keeps up a power of thinking I should reckon she added
suddenly eying him critically that yo and she might have a heap o
things to say to each other Shes a good deal in yo fashion
connle she dont forget butmore slowlyI dont know that THATS
altogether the best thing for YO

Courtland lifted his eyes with affected consternation If this is in
the light of another mysterious warning Miss Dows I warn you that my
intellect is already tottering with them Last Sunday Miss Reed thrilled
me for an hour with superstition and Cassandralike prophecy Dont
things ever happen accidentally here and without warning

I mean returned the young lady with her usual practical directness
that Tave Reed remembers a good many horrid things about the wah that
she ought to forget but dont But she continued looking at him
curiously she allows she was mighty cut up by her cousins manner to
yo

I am afraid that Miss Reed was more annoyed than I was said
Courtland I should be very sorry if she attached any importance to
it he added earnestly

And YO dont continued Miss Sally

No Why should I She noticed however that he had slightly drawn
himself up a little more erect and she smiled as he continued I dare
say I should feel as he does if I were in his place

But YO wouldnt do anything underhanded she said quietly As he
glanced at her quickly she added dryly Dont trust too much to people
always acting in yo fashion connle And dont think too much nor too
little of what yo hear here Yo re just the kind of man to make a
good many silly enemies and as many foolish friends And I dont know
which will give yo the most trouble Only dont yo underrate EITHER
or hold yo head so high yo dont see whats crawlin around yo
Thats why in a copperhead swamp a horse is bitten oftener than a
hog

She smiled yet with knitted brows and such a pretty affectation of
concern for her companion that he suddenly took heart

I wish I had ONE friend I could call my own he said boldly looking
straight into her eyes Id care little for other friends and fear no
enemies

Yo re right connle she said ostentatiously slanting her parasol
in a marvelous simulation of hiding a purely imaginative blush on a
cheek that was perfectly infantine in its unchanged pink company talk
is much pootier than what weve been saying Andmeaning mefor I
reckon yo wouldnt say that of any other girl but the one yo re
walking withwhats the matter with me

He could not help smiling though he hesitated Nothing but others
have been disappointed

And that bothers YO

I mean I have as yet had no right to put your feelings to any test
while

Poor Chet had yo were going to say Well here we are at the
cemetery I reckoned yo were bound to get back to the dead again before
wed gone far and thats why I thought we might take the cemetery on
our way It may put me in a more proper frame of mind to please yo

As he raised his eyes he could not repress a slight start He had not
noticed before that they had passed through a small gateway on diverging
from the road and was quite unprepared to find himself on the edge of a
gentle slope leading to a beautiful valley and before him a long vista
of tombs white headstones and low crosses edged by drooping cypress
and trailing feathery vines Some vines had fallen and been caught in
long loops from bough to bough like funeral garlands and here and
there the tops of isolated palmettos lifted a cluster of hearselike
plumes Yet in spite of this dominance of sombre but graceful shadow
the drooping delicacy of darktasseled foliage and leafy fringes
and the waving mourning veils of gray translucent moss a glorious
vivifying Southern sun smiled and glittered everywhere as through tears
The balm of bay southernwood pine and syringa breathed through the
long alleys the stimulating scent of roses moved with every zephyr
and the closer odors of jessamine honeysuckle and orange flowers hung
heavily in the hollows It seemed to Courtland like the mourning of
beautiful and youthful widowhood seductive even in its dissembling
trappings provocative in the contrast of its own still strong virility
Everywhere the grass grew thick and luxuriant the quick earth was
teeming with the germination of the dead below

They moved slowly along side by side speaking only of the beauty of the
spot and the glory of that summer day which seemed to have completed
its perfection here Perhaps from the heat the overpowering perfume
or some unsuspected sentiment the young lady became presently as silent
and preoccupied as her companion She began to linger and loiter behind
hovering like a butterfly over some flowering shrub or clustered sheaf
of lilies until encountered suddenly in her floating draperies she
might have been taken for a somewhat early and far too becoming ghost
It seemed to him also that her bright eyes were slightly shadowed by
a gentle thoughtfulness He moved close to her side with an irresistible
impulse of tenderness but she turned suddenly and saying Come
moved at a quicker pace down a narrow side path Courtland followed He
had not gone far before he noticed that the graves seemed to fall into
regular lines the emblems became cheaper and more common wooden head
and foot stones of one monotonous pattern took the place of carved
freestone or marble and he knew that they had reached that part of the
cemetery reserved for those who had fallen in the war The long lines
drawn with military precision stretched through the little valley and
again up the opposite hill in an odd semblance of hollow squares ranks
and columns A vague recollection of the fateful slope of Snake River
came over him It was intensified as Miss Sally who was still preceding
him suddenly stopped before an isolated mound bearing a broken marble
shaft and a pedestal with the inscription Chester Brooks A few
withered garlands and immortelles were lying at its base but encircling
the broken shaft was a perfectly fresh unfaded wreath

You never told me he was buried here said Courtland quickly half
shocked at the unexpected revelation Was he from this State

No but his regiment was said Miss Sally eying the wreath
critically

And this wreath is it from you continued Courtland gently

Yes I thought yo d like to see something fresh and pooty instead of
those stale ones

And were they also from you he asked even more gently

Dear no They were left over from last anniversary day by some of the
veterans Thats the only one I put therethat isI got Mr Champney
to leave it here on his way to his house He lives just yonder yo
know

It was impossible to resist this invincible naivete Courtland bit
his lip as the vision arose before him of this still more naif English
admirer bringing hither at Miss Sallys bidding the tribute which
she wished to place on the grave of an old lover to please a THIRD
man Meantime she had put her two little hands behind her back in the
simulated attitude of a good girl and was saying half smilingly and
he even thought half wistfully

Are yo satisfied

Perfectly

Then lets go away Its mighty hot here

They turned away and descending the slope again reentered the thicker
shade of the main avenue Here they seemed to have left the sterner
aspect of Death They walked slowly the air was heavy with the hot
incense of flowers the road sinking a little left a grassy bank on one
side Here Miss Sally halted and listlessly seated herself motioning
Courtland to do the same He obeyed eagerly The incident of the wreath
had troubled him albeit with contending sensations She had given it to
please HIM why should HE question the manner or torment himself with
any retrospective thought He would have given worlds to have been able
to accept it lightly or gallantlywith any other girl he could but
he knew he was trembling on the verge of a passionate declaration the
magnitude of the stake was too great to be imperiled by a levity
of which she was more a mistress than himself and he knew that his
sentiment had failed to impress her His pride kept him from appealing
to her strangely practical nature although he had recognized and
accepted it and had even begun to believe it an essential part of the
strong fascination she had over him But being neither a coward nor a
weak hesitating idealist when he deliberately took his seat beside
her he as deliberately made up his mind to accept his fate whatever it
might be then and there

Perhaps there was something of this in his face I thought yo were
looking a little white connle she said quietly and I reckoned
we might sit down a spell and then take it slowly home Yo aint
accustomed to the Sothn sun and the air in the hollow WAS swampy As
he made a slight gesture of denial she went on with a pretty sisterly
superiority Thats the way of yo Nothn men Yo think yo can
do everything just as if yo were reared to it and yo never make
allowance for different climates different blood and different
customs Thats where yo slip up

But he was already leaning towards her with his dark earnest eyes fixed
upon her in a way she could no longer mistake At the risk of slipping
up again Miss Dows he said gently dropping into her dialect with
utterly unconscious flattery I am going to ask you to teach me
everything YOU wish to be all that YOU demandwhich would be far
better You have said we were good friends I want you to let me hope to
be more I want you to overlook my deficiencies and the differences of
my race and let me meet you on the only level where I can claim to be
the equal of your own peoplethat of loving you Give me only the same
chance you gave the other poor fellow who sleeps yonderthe same chance
you gave the luckier man who carried the wreath for you to put upon his
grave

She had listened with delicately knitted brows the faintest touch of
color and a halflaughing halfsuperior disapprobation When he had
finished she uttered a plaintive little sigh Yo oughtnt to have
said that connle but yo and me are too good friends to let even THAT
stand between us And to prove it to yo Im going to forget it right
awayand so are yo

But I cannot he said quickly if I could I should be unworthy of
even your friendship If you must reject it do not make me feel the
shame of thinking you believe me capable of wanton trifling I know that
this avowal is abrupt to you but it is not to me You have known
me only for three months but these three months have been to me the
realization of three years dreaming As she remained looking at him
with bright curious eyes but still shaking her fair head distressedly
he moved nearer and caught her hand in the little pale lilac thread
glove that was nevertheless too wide for her small fingers and said
appealingly But why should YOU forget it Why must it be a forbidden
topic What is the barrier Are you no longer free Speak Miss
Dowsgive me some hope Miss DowsSally

She had drawn herself away distressed protesting her fair head turned
aside until with a slight twist and narrowing of her hand she succeeded
in slipping it from the glove which she left a prisoner in his eager
clasp There Yo can keep the glove connle she said breathing
quickly Sit down This is not the place nor the weather for husking
frolics Wellyo want to know WHY yo mustnt speak to me in that
way Be still and Ill tell yo

She smoothed down the folds of her frock sitting sideways on the bank
one little foot touching the road Yo mustnt speak that way to me
she went on slowly because its as much as yo companys woth as
much as OUR propertys woth as much maybe as yo lifes woth Dont
lift yo comb connle if you dont care for THAT others may Sit
still I tell yo Well yo come here from the Noth to run this
property for moneythats square and fair business THAT any fool here
can understandits Nothn style it dont interfere with these fools
family affairs it dont bring into their blood any Nothn taint
it dont divide their clannishness it dont separate father and son
sister and brother and even if yo got a foothold here and settled
down they know they can always outvote yo five to one But let these
same fools know that yo re courtin a Sothn girl known to be Union
during the wah that girl who has laughed at their foolishness let them
even THINK that he wants that girl to mix up the family and the race and
the property for him and there aint a young or old fool that believes
in Sothn isolation as the price of Sothn salvation that wouldnt
rise against yo There isnt one that wouldnt make shipwreck of yor
syndicate and yor capital and the prosperity of Redlands for the next
four years to come and think they were doing right They began to
suspect yo from the first They suspected yo when yo never went
anywhere but stuck close to the fahm and me Thats why I wanted yo
to show yourself among the girls they wouldnt have minded yo flirting
with them with the chance of yo breaking yo heart over Tave Reed or
Lympy Morris Theyre fools enough to believe that a snub or a jilt
from a Sothn girl would pay them back for a lost battle or a ruined
plantation

For the first time Miss Sally saw Courtlands calm blood fly to his
cheek and kindle in his eye You surely do not expect ME to tolerate
this blind and insolent interference he said rising to his feet

She lifted her ungloved hand in deprecation Sit still connle Yo
ve been a soldier and yo know what duty is Well whats yo duty to
yo company

It neither includes my private affairs nor regulates the beating of my
heart I will resign

And leave me and Aunt Miranda and the plantation

No The company will find another superintendent to look after your
aunts affairs and carry out our plans And you Sallyyou will let me
find you a home and fortune North There is work for me there there is
room for you among my people

She shook her head slowly with a sweet but superior smile No connle
I didnt believe in the wah but the least I could do was to stand by my
folks and share the punishment that I knew was coming from it I despise
this foolishness as much as yo but I cant run away from it Come
connle I wont ask yo to forget this mo Ill even believe yo
MEANT it but yo ll promise me yo wont speak of it again as long
as yo are with the company and Aunt Miranda and me There mustnt be
morethere mustnt even SEEM to be morebetween us

But then I may hope he said eagerly grasping her hand

I promise nothing for yo must not even have THAT excuse for speaking
of this again either from anything I do or may seem to do She
stopped released her hand as her eyes were suddenly fixed on the
distance Then she said with a slight smile but without the least
embarrassment or impatience Theres Mr Champney coming here now I
reckon hes looking to see if that wreath is safe

Courtland looked up quickly He could see the straw hat of the young
Englishman just above the myrtle bushes in a path intersecting the
avenue A faint shadow crossed his face Let me know one thing more
he said hurriedly I know I have no right to ask the question but
hashashas Mr Champney anything to do with your decision

She smiled brightly Yo asked just now if yo could have the same
chance he and Chet Brooks had Well poor Chet is dead and Mr
Champneywellwait and see She lifted her voice and called Mr
Champney The young fellow came briskly towards them his face betrayed
a slight surprise but no discomfiture as he recognized her companion

Oh Mr Champney said Miss Sally plaintively Ive lost my glove
somewhere near pooah Brookss tomb in the hollow Wont you go and fetch
it and come back here to take me home The connle has got to go and
see his sick niggers in the hospital Champney lifted his hat nodded
genially to Courtland and disappeared below the cypresses on the slope
Yo mustnt be mad she said turning in explanation to her companion
but we have been here too long already and its better that I should
be seen coming home with him than yo

Then this sectional interference does not touch him said Courtland
bitterly

No Hes an Englishman his father was a known friend of the
Confederacy and bought their cotton bonds

She stopped gazing into Courtlands face with a pretty vague impatience
and a slight pouting of her lip

Connle

Miss Sally

Yo say yo had known me for three years before yo saw me Well we
met once before we ever spoke to each other

Courtland looked in her laughing eyes with admiring wonder When he
asked

The first day yo came Yo moved the ladder when I was on the cornice
and I walked all ever yo head And like a gentleman yo never said a
word about it I reckon I stood on yo head for five minutes

Not as long as that said Courtland laughing if I remember rightly

Yes said Miss Sally with dancing eyes I a Sothn girl actually
set my foot on the head of a Nothn scum of a connle My

Let that satisfy your friends then

No I want to apologize Sit down connle

But Miss Sally

Sit down quick

He did so seating himself sideways on the bank Miss Sally stood beside
him

Take off yo hat sir

He obeyed smilingly Miss Sally suddenly slipped behind him He felt the
soft touch of her small hands on his shoulders warm breath stirred the
roots of his hair and thenthe light pressure on his scalp of what
seemed the lips of a child

He leaped to his feet yet before he could turn completely rounda
difficulty the young lady had evidently calculated uponhe was too
late The floating draperies of the artful and shameless Miss Sally were
already disappearing among the tombs in the direction of the hollow


CHAPTER V


The house occupied by the manager of the Drummond Syndicate in
Redlandsthe former residence of a local lawyer and justice of the
peacewas not large but had an imposing portico of wooden Doric
columns which extended to the roof and fronted the main street The
allpervading creeper closely covered it the sidewalk before it was
shaded by a row of broadleaved ailantus The front room with French
windows opening on the portico was used by Colonel Courtland as a
general office beyond this a sittingroom and diningroom overlooked
the oldfashioned garden with its detached kitchen and inevitable negro
cabin It was a close evening there were dark clouds coming up in the
direction of the turnpike road but the leaves of the ailantus hung
heavy and motionless in the hush of an impending storm The sparks of
lazily floating fireflies softly expanded and went out in the gloom of
the black foliage or in the dark recesses of the office whose windows
were widely open and whose lights Courtland had extinguished when he
brought his armchair to the portico for coolness One of these sparks
beyond the fence although alternately glowing and paling was still so
persistent and stationary that Courtland leaned forward to watch it more
closely at which it disappeared and a voice from the street said

Is that you Courtland

Yes Come in wont you

The voice was Champneys and the light was from his cigar As he
opened the gate and came slowly up the steps of the portico the usual
hesitation of his manner seemed to have increased A long sigh trilled
the limp leaves of the ailantus and as quickly subsided A few heavy
perpendicular raindrops crashed and spattered through the foliage like
molten lead

Youve just escaped the shower said Courtland pleasantly He had not
seen Champney since they parted in the cemetery six weeks before

YesII thought Id like to have a little talk with you Courtland
said Champney He hesitated a moment before the proffered chair and
then added with a cautious glance towards the street Hadnt we better
go inside

As you like But youll find it wofully hot Were quite alone here
theres nobody in the house and this shower will drive any loungers
from the street He was quite frank although their relations to each
other in regard to Miss Sally were still so undefined as to scarcely
invite his confidence

Howbeit Champney took the proffered chair and the glass of julep which
Courtland brought him

You remember my speaking to you of Dumont he said hesitatingly Miss
Dows French cousin you know Wellhes coming here hes got property
herethose three houses opposite the Court House From what I hear
hes come over with a lot of newfangled French ideas on the nigger
questionrot about equality and fraternity dont you knowand the
highest education and highest offices for them You know what the
feeling is here already You know what happened at the last election at
Coolidgevillehow the whites wouldnt let the niggers go to the polls
and the jolly row that was kicked up over it Well it looks as if that
sort of thing might happen HERE dont you know if Miss Dows takes up
these ideas

But Ive reason to supposeI mean said Courtland correcting himself
with some deliberation that any one who knows Miss Dows opinions
knows that these are not her views Why should she take them up

Because she takes HIM up returned Champney hurriedly and even
if she didnt believe in them herself shed have to share the
responsibility with him in the eyes of every unreconstructed rowdy like
Tom Higbee and the rest of them Theyd make short work of her niggers
all the same

But I dont see why she should be made responsible for the opinions of
her cousin nor do I exactly knew what taking him up means returned
Courtland quietly

Champney moistened his dry lips with the julep and uttered a nervous
laugh Suppose we say her husbandfor thats what his coming back here
means Everybody knows that you would too if you ever talked with her
about anything but business

A bright flash of lightning that lit up the faces of the two men would
have revealed Champneys flushed features and Courtlands lack of color
had they been looking at each other But they were not and the long
reverberating crash of thunder which followed prevented any audible
reply from Courtland and covered his agitation

For without fully accepting Champneys conclusions he was cruelly
shocked at the young mans utterance of them He had scrupulously
respected the wishes of Miss Sally and had faithfullyalthough never
hopelesslyheld back any expression of his own love since their
conversation in the cemetery But while his native truthfulness and
sense of honor had overlooked the seeming insincerity of her attitude
towards Champney he had never justified his own tacit participation
in it and the concealment of his own pretensions before his possible
rival It was true that she had forbidden him to openly enter the
lists with her admirers but Champneys innocent assumption of his
indifference to her and his consequent half confidences added poignancy
to his story There seemed to be only one way to extricate himself
and that was by a quarrel Whether he did or did not believe Champneys
story whether it was only the jealous exaggeration of a rival or
Miss Sally was actually deceiving them both his position had become
intolerable

I must remind you Champney he said with freezing deliberation
that Miss Miranda Dows and her niece now represent the Drummond Company
equally with myself and that you cannot expect me to listen to any
reflections upon the way they choose to administer their part in its
affairs either now or to come Still less do I care to discuss the
idle gossip which can affect only the PRIVATE interests of these ladies
with which neither you nor I have any right to interfere

But the naivete of the young Englishman was as invincible as Miss
Sallys own and as fatal to Courtlands attitude Of course I havent
any RIGHT you know he said calmly ignoring the severe preamble of
his companions speech but I say hang it all even if a fellow has
no chance HIMSELF he dont like to see a girl throw herself and her
property away on a man like that

One moment Champney said Courtland under the infection of his
guests simplicity abandoning his former superior attitude You say
you have no chance Do you want me to understand that you are regularly
a suitor of Miss Dows

Yees said the young fellow but with the hesitation of
conscientiousness rather than evasion That isyou know I WAS But
dont you see it couldnt be It wouldnt do you know If those
clannish neighbors of hersthat Southern setsuspected that Miss
Sally was courted by an Englishman dont you knowa poacher on their
preservesit would be all up with her position on the property and her
influence over them I dont mind telling you thats one reason why I
left the company and took that other plantation But even that didnt
work they had their suspicions excited already

Did Miss Dows give that as a reason for declining your suit asked
Courtland slowly

Yes You know what a straightforward girl she is She didnt come no
rot about not expecting anything of the kind or about being a sister
to me and all that for by Jove shes always more like a fellows
sister dont you know than his girl Of course it was hard lines for
me but I suppose she was about right He stopped and then added with
a kind of gentle persistency YOU think she was about right dont
you

With what was passing in Courtlands mind the question seemed so
bitterly ironical that at first he leaned half angrily forward in an
unconscious attempt to catch the speakers expression in the darkness
I should hardly venture to give an opinion he said after a pause
Miss Dows relations with her neighbors are so very peculiar And from
what you tell me of her cousin it would seem that her desire to placate
them is not always to be depended upon

Im not finding fault with HER you know said Champney hastily Im
not such a beastly cad as that I wouldnt have spoken of my affairs at
all but you asked you know I only thought if she was going to get
herself into trouble on account of that Frenchman you might talk to
hershed listen to you because shed know you only did it out of
business reasons And theyre really business reasons you know I
suppose you dont think much of my business capacity colonel and you
wouldnt go much on my judgmentespecially now but Ive been here
longer than you andhe lowered his voice slightly and dragged his
chair nearer CourtlandI dont like the looks of things here Theres
some devilment plotting among those rascals Theyre only awaiting an
opportunity a single flash would be enough to set them in a blaze even
if the fire wasnt lit and smouldering already like a spark in a bale of
cotton Id cut the whole thing and clear out if I didnt think it would
make it harder for Miss Dows who would be left alone

Youre a good fellow Champney said Courtland laying his hand on
the young mans shoulder with a sudden impulse and I forgive you for
overlooking any concern that I might have Indeed he added with an
odd seriousness and a half sigh its not strange that you should But
I must remind you that the Dowses are strictly the agents and tenants of
the company I represent and that their rights and property under that
tenancy shall not be interfered with by others as long as I am here
I have no right however he added gravely to keep Miss Dows from
imperiling them by her social relations

Champney rose and shook hands with him awkwardly The shower seems to
be holding up he said and Ill toddle along before it starts afresh
Goodnight I sayyou didnt mind my coming to you this way did you
By Jove I thought you were a little standoffish at first But you know
what I meant

Perfectly and I thank you They shook hands again Champney stepped
from the portico and reaching the gate seemed to vanish as he had
come out of the darkness

The storm was not yet over the air had again become close and
suffocating Courtland remained brooding in his chair Whether he could
accept Champneys news as true or not he felt that he must end this
suspense at once A halfguilty consciousness that he was thinking more
of it in reference to his own passion than his duty to the company
did not render his meditations less unpleasant Yet while he could
not reconcile Miss Sallys confidences in the cemetery concerning the
indifference of her people to Champneys attentions with what Champney
had just told him of the reasons she had given HIM for declining them
I am afraid he was not shocked by her peculiar ethics A lover seldom
finds fault with his mistress for deceiving his rival and is as little
apt to consider the logical deduction that she could deceive him also
as Othello was to accept Brabantios warning The masculine sense of
honor which might have resented the friendship of a man capable of such
treachery did not hesitate to accept the love of a woman under the same
conditions Perhaps there was an implied compliment in thus allowing her
to take the sole ethical responsibility which few women would resist

In the midst of this gloomy abstraction Courtland suddenly raised his
head and listened

Cato

Yes sah

There was a sound of heavy footsteps in the hall coming from the rear of
the house and presently a darker bulk appeared in the shadowed doorway
It was his principal overseera strong and superior negro selected
by his fellowfreedmen from among their number in accordance with
Courtlands new regime

Did you come here from the plantation or the town

The town sah

I think you had better keep out of the town in the evenings for the
present said Courtland in a tone of quiet but positive authority

Are dey goin to bring back de ole patter rollers sah asked the
man with a slight sneer

  The patrol or local police who formerly had the
 surveillance of slaves

I dont know returned Courtland calmly ignoring his overseers
manner But if they did you must comply with the local regulations
unless they conflict with the Federal laws when you must appeal to the
Federal authorities I prefer you should avoid any trouble until you are
sure

I reckon they wont try any games on me said the negro with a short
laugh

Courtland looked at him intently

I thought as much Youre carrying arms Cato Hand them over

The overseer hesitated for a moment and then unstrapped a revolver from
his belt and handed it to Courtland

Now how many of you are in the habit of going round the town armed like
this

Only de men whove been insulted sah

And how have YOU been insulted

Marse Tom Highee down in de market reckoned it was high time fancy
niggers was drov into de swamp and I allowed that loafers and beggars
had better roost high when workin folks was around and Marse Tom said
hed cut my haht out

And do you think your carrying a revolver will prevent him and his
friends performing that operation if you provoked them

You said we was to pertect oursefs sah returned the negro gloomily
What foh den did you drill us to use dem rifles in de armory

To defend yourselves TOGETHER under orders if attacked not to singly
threaten with them in a street row Together you would stand some
chance against those men separately they could eat you up Cato

I wouldnt trust too much to some of dem niggers standing together
sah said Gate darkly Deyd run before de old mastersif they didnt
run to em Shuah

A fear of this kind had crossed Courtlands mind before but he made no
present comment I found two of the armory rifles in the mens cabins
yesterday he resumed quietly See that it does not occur again They
must not be taken from the armory except to defend it

Yes sah

There was a moment of silence Then it was broken by a sudden gust that
swept through the columns of the portico stirring the vines The broad
leaves of the ailantus began to rustle an ominous pattering followed
the rain had recommenced And as Courtland rose and walked towards the
open window its blank panes and the interior of the office were suddenly
illuminated by a gleam of returning lightning

He entered the office bidding Cato follow and lit the lamp above
his desk The negro remained standing gloomily but respectfully by the
window

Cato do you know anything of Mr DumontMiss Dows cousin

The negros white teeth suddenly flashed in the lamplight Ya ha I
reckon sah

Then hes a great friend of your people

I dont know about dat sah But hes a powful enemy of de Reeds and
de Higbees

On account of his views of course

Deed no said Cato with an astounded air Jess on account of de
vendetta

The vendetta

Yes sah De old blood quoll of de families Its been goin on over
fifty years sah De granfader fader and brudder of de Higbees was
killed by de granfader fader and brudder of de Doomonts De Reeds
chipped in when all de Higbees was played out fo dey was relations
but dey was chawed up by some of de Dowses first cousins to de
Doomonts

What Are the Dows in this vendetta

No sah No mo Deys bin no man in de family since Miss Sallys fader
dieddats let de Dows out fo ever De las shootin was done by
Marse Jack Doomont who crippled Marse Tom Higbees brudder Jo and
den skipped to Europe Dey say hes come back and is lying low over at
Atlanty Darll be lively times of he comes here to see Miss Sally

But he may have changed his ideas while living abroad where this sort
of thing is simple murder

The negro shook his head grimly Den he wouldnt come sah No sah He
knows dat Tom Higbees bound to go fo him or leave de place and Marse
Jack wouldnt mind settlin HIM too as well as his brudder for de
scores is agin de Doomonts yet And Marse Jack aint no slouch wid a
scatter gun

At any other time the imminence of this survival of a lawless barbarism
of which he had heard so much would have impressed Courtland now he was
only interested in it on account of the inconceivable position in which
it left Miss Sally Had she anything to do with this baleful cousins
return or was she only to be a helpless victim of it

A white dazzling and bewildering flash of lightning suddenly lit
up the room the porch the dripping ailantus and the flooded street
beyond It was followed presently by a crash of thunder with what
seemed to be a second fainter flash of lightning or rather as if the
first flash had suddenly ignited some inflammable substance With the
long reverberation of the thunder still shaking the house Courtland
slipped quickly out of the window and passed down to the gate

Did it strike anything sah said the startled negro as Courtland
returned

Not that I can see said his employer shortly Go inside and call
Zoe and her daughter from the cabin and bring them in the hall Stay
till I come GoIll shut the windows myself

It must have struck somewhere sah shuah Dehs a powful smell of
sulphur right here said the negro as he left the room

Courtland thought so too but it was a kind of sulphur that he had
smelled beforeon the battlefield For when the door was closed behind
his overseer he took the lamp to the opposite wall and examined it
carefully There was the distinct hole made by a bullet which had missed
Catos head at the open window by an inch


CHAPTER VI


In an instant Courtland had regained complete possession of himself His
distracting passionhow distracting he had never before realizedwas
gone His clear sightno longer distorted by sentimenthad come back
he saw everything in its just proportionhis duty the plantation the
helpless freedman threatened by lawless fury the two womenno longer
his one tantalizing vision but now only a passing detail of the work
before him He saw them through no aberrating mist of tenderness or
expediencybut with the single directness of the man of action

The shot had clearly been intended for Cato Even if it were an act
of mere personal revenge it showed a confidence and security in the
wouldbe assassin that betokened cooperation and an organized plan
He had availed himself of the thunderstorm the flash and long
reverberating roll of soundan artifice not unknown to border
ambushto confuse discovery at the instant Yet the attack might be
only an isolated one or it might be the beginning of a general raid
upon the Syndicates freedmen If the former he could protect Cato from
its repetition by guarding him in the office until he could be conveyed
to a place of safety if the latter he must at once collect the negroes
at their quarters and take Cato with him He resolved upon the latter
course The quarters were half a mile from the Dows dwellingwhich was
two miles away

He sat down and wrote a few lines to Miss Dows stating that in view
of some threatened disturbances in the town he thought it advisable
to keep the negroes in their quarters whither he was himself going He
sent her his housekeeper and the child as they had both better remain
in a place of security until he returned to town He gave the note to
Zoe bidding her hasten by the back garden across the fields Then he
turned to Cato

I am going with you to the quarters tonight he said quietly and you
can carry your pistol back to the armory yourself He handed him the
weapon The negro received it gratefully but suddenly cast a searching
glance at his employer Courtlands face however betrayed no change
When Zoe had gone he continued tranquilly We will go by the back way
through the woods As the negro started slightly Courtland continued
in the same even tone The sulphur you smelled just now Cato was the
smoke of a gun fired at YOU from the street I dont propose that the
shot shall be repeated under the same advantages

The negro became violently agitated It was dat sneakin hound Tom
Higbee he said huskily

Courtland looked at him sharply Then there was something more than
WORDS passed between him and you Cato What happened Come speak out

He lashed me with his whip and I gib him one right under the yeah and
drupped him said Cato recovering his courage with his anger at the
recollection I had a right to defend mysef sah

Yes and I hope youll be able to do it now said Courtland calmly
his face giving no sign of his conviction that Catos fate was doomed by
that single retaliating blow but youll be safer at the quarters
He passed into his bedroom took a revolver from his bedhead and a
derringer from the drawer both of which he quickly slipped beneath his
buttoned coat and returned

When we are in the fields clear of the house keep close by my side
and even try to keep step with me What you have to say say NOW there
must be no talking to betray our positionwe must go silently and
youll have enough to do to exercise your eyes and ears I shall stand
between you and any attack but I expect you to obey orders without
hesitation He opened the back door motioned to Cato to pass out
followed him locked the door behind them and taking the negros arm
walked beside the low palings to the end of the garden where they
climbed the fence and stood upon the open field beyond

Unfortunately it had grown lighter with the breaking of the heavy
clouds and gusty gleams of moonlight chased each other over the
field or struck a glitter from standing rainpools between the little
hillocks To cross the open field and gain the fringe of woods on the
other side was the nearest way to the quarters but for the moment was
the most exposed course to follow the hedge to the bottom of the field
and the boundary fence and then cross at right angles in its shadow
would be safer but they would lose valuable time Believing that Catos
vengeful assailant was still hovering near with his comrades Courtland
cast a quick glance down the shadowy line of Osage hedge beside them
Suddenly Cato grasped his arm and pointed in the same direction where
the boundary fence he had noticeda barrier of rough palingscrossed
the field With the moon low on the other side of it it was a mere
black silhouette broken only by bright silver openings and gaps along
its surface that indicated the moonlit field beyond At first Courtland
saw nothing else Then he was struck by the fact that these openings
became successively and regularly eclipsed as with the passing of some
opaque object behind them It was a file of men on the other side of
the fence keeping in its shelter as they crossed the field towards his
house Roughly calculating from the passing obscurations there must
have been twelve or fifteen in all

He could no longer doubt their combined intentions nor hesitate how to
meet them He must at once make for the quarters with Cato even if he
had to cross that open field before them He knew that they would avoid
injuring him personally in the fear of possible Federal and political
complications and he resolved to use that fear to insure Catos safety
Placing his hands on the negros shoulders he shoved him forwards
falling into a lock step so close behind him that it became impossible
for the most expert marksman to fire at one without imperiling the
others life When half way across the field he noticed that the shadows
seen through the openings of the fence had paused The ambushed men
had evidently seen the double apparition understood it and as he
expected dared not fire He reached the other side with Cato in safety
but not before he saw the fateful shadows again moving and this time in
their own direction They were evidently intending to pursue them But
once within the woods Courtland knew that his chances were equal
He breathed more freely Cato now less agitated had even regained
something of his former emotional combativeness which Courtland had
checked Although far from confident of his henchmans prowess in an
emergency the prospect of getting him safe into the quarters seemed
brighter

It was necessary also to trust to his superior woodcraft and
knowledge of the locality and Courtland still walking between him and
his pursuers and covering his retreat allowed him to lead the way It
lay over ground that was beginning to slope gently the underbrush
was presently exchanged for springy moss the character of the trees
changed the black trunks of cypresses made the gloom thicker Trailing
vines and parasites brushed their faces a current of damp air seemed to
flow just above the soil in which their lower limbs moved sluggishly as
through stagnant water As yet there was no indication of pursuit But
Courtland felt that it was not abandoned Indeed he had barely time
to check an exclamation from the negro before the dull gallop of
horsehoofs in the open ahead of them was plain to them both It was a
second party of their pursuers mounted who had evidently been sent
to prevent their final egress from the woods while those they had just
evaded were no doubt slowly and silently following them on foot They
were to be caught between two fires

What is there to the left of us whispered Courtland quickly

De swamp

Courtland set his teeth together His dullwitted companion had
evidently walked them both into the trap Nevertheless his resolve was
quickly made He could already see through the thinning fringe of timber
the figures of the mounted men in the moonlight

This should be the boundary line of the plantation This field beside
us is ours he said interrogatively

Yes returned the negro but de quarters is a mile furder

Good Stay here until I come back or call you Im going to talk to
these fellows But if you value your life dont YOU speak nor stir

He strode quickly through the intervening trees and stepped out into the
moonlight A suppressed shout greeted him and half a dozen mounted
men masked and carrying rifles rode down towards him but he remained
quietly waiting there and as the nearest approached him he made a step
forward and cried Halt

The men pulled up sharply and mechanically at that ring of military
imperiousness

What are you doing here said Courtland

We reckon thats OUR business connle

Its mine when youre on property that I control

The man hesitated and looked interrogatively towards his fellows I
allow youve got us there connle he said at last with the lazy
insolence of conscious power but I dont mind telling you were wanting
a nigger about the size of your Cato We haint got anything agin YOU
connle we dont want to interfere with YOUR property and YOUR ways
but we dont calculate to have strangers interfere with OUR ways and
OUR customs Trot out your niggeryou Nothn folks dont call HIM
property you knowand well clear off your land

And may I ask what you want of Cato said Courtland quietly

To show him that all the Federal law in hll wont protect him when
he strikes a white man burst out one of the masked figures riding
forward

Then you compel me to show YOU said Courtland immovably what any
Federal citizen may do in the defense of Federal law For Ill kill the
first man that attempts to lay hands upon him on my property Some of
you who have already tried to assassinate him in cold blood I have met
before in less dishonorable warfare than this and THEY know I am able
to keep my word

There was a moments silence the barrel of the revolver he was holding
at his side glistened for an instant in the moonlight but he did not
move The two men rode up to the first speaker and exchanged words A
light laugh followed and the first speaker turned again to Courtland
with a mocking politeness

Very well connle if thats your opinion and you allow we cant
follow our game over your property why we reckon well have to give
way TO THOSE WHO CAN Sorry to have troubled YOU Goodnight

He lifted his hat ironically waved it to his followers and the next
moment the whole party were galloping furiously towards the high road

For the first time that evening a nervous sense of apprehension passed
over Courtland The impending of some unknown danger is always more
terrible to a brave man than the most overwhelming odds that he can
see and realize He felt instinctively that they had uttered no vague
bravado to cover up their defeat there was still some advantage on
which they confidently reckonedbut what Was it only a reference to
the other party tracking them through the woods on which their enemies
now solely relied He regained Cato quickly the white teeth of the
foolishly confident negro were already flashing his imagined triumph to
his employer Courtlands heart grew sick as he saw it

Were not out of the woods yet Cato he said dryly nor are they
Keep your eyes and ears open and attend to me How long can we keep
in the cover of these woods and still push on in the direction of the
quarters

Theres a way roun de edge o de swamp sah but wed have to go back
a spell to find it

Go on

And dars moccasins and copperheads lying round here in de trail Dey
dont go for us ginerallybut he hesitated white men dont stand
much show

Good Then it is as bad for those who are chasing us as for me That
will do Lead on

They retraced their steps cautiously until the negro turned into a
lighter byway A strange mephitic odor seemed to come from sodden
leaves and mosses that began to ooze under their feet They had picked
their way in silence for some minutes the stunted willows and cypress
standing farther and farther apart and the openings with clumps of
sedge were frequent Courtland was beginning to fear this exposure
of his follower and had moved up beside him when suddenly the negro
caught his arm and trembled violently His lips were parted over
his teeth the whites of his eyes glistened he seemed gasping and
speechless with fear

Whats the matter Cato said Courtland glancing instinctively at the
ground beneath Speak manhave you been bitten

The word seemed to wring an agonized cry from the miserable man

Bitten No but dont you hear em coming sah God Almighty dont you
hear dat

What

De dogs de hounsDE BLOODHOUNS Deyve set em loose on me

It was true A faint baying in the distance was now distinctly audible
to Courtland He knew now plainly the full cruel purport of the
leaders speechthose who could go anywhere were tracking their game

Every trace of manhood had vanished from the negros cowering frame
Courtland laid his hand assuringly appealingly and then savagely on
his shoulder

Come Enough of this I am here and will stand by you whatever comes
These dogs are no more to be feared than the others Rouse yourself
man and at least help ME make a fight of it

No no screamed the terrified man Lemme go Lemme go back to de
Massas Tell em Ill come Tell em to call de houns off me and Ill
go quiet Lemme go He struggled violently in his companions grasp

In all Courtlands selfcontrol habits of coolness and discipline it
is to be feared there was still something of the old Berserker temper
His face was white his eyes blazed in the darkness only his voice kept
that level distinctness which made it for a moment more terrible than
even the baying of the tracking hounds to the negros ear Cato he
said attempt to run now and by God Ill save the dogs the trouble
of grappling your living carcass Come here Up that tree with you
pointing to a swamp magnolia Dont move as long as I can stand here
and when Im downbut not till thensave yourselfthe best you can

He half helped half dragged the now passive African to the solitary
tree as the bay of a single hound came nearer the negro convulsively
scrambled from Courtlands knee and shoulder to the fork of branches a
dozen feet from the ground Courtland drew his revolver and stepping
back a few yards into the open awaited the attack

It came unexpectedly from behind A sudden yelp of panting cruelty and
frenzied anticipation at Courtlands back caused him to change front
quickly and the dripping fangs and snaky boalike neck of a gray weird
shadow passed him With an awful supernaturalness of instinct it kept
on in an unerring line to the fateful tree But that dread directness of
scent was Courtlands opportunity His revolver flashed out in an aim as
unerring The brute pierced through neck and brain dashed on against
the tree in his impetus and then rolled over against it in a quivering
bulk Again another bay coming from the same direction told Courtland
that his pursuers had outflanked him and the whole pack were crossing
the swamp But he was prepared again the same weird shadow as spectral
and monstrous as a dream dashed out into the brief light of the open
but this time it was stopped and rolled over convulsively before it had
crossed Flushed with the fire of fight in his veins Courtland turned
almost furiously from the fallen brutes at his feet to meet the onset of
the more cowardly hunters whom he knew were at his heels At that moment
it would have fared ill with the foremost No longer the calculating
steward and diplomatic manager no longer the coolheaded arbiter of
conflicting interests he was ready to meet them not only with the
intrepid instincts of a soldier but with an aroused partisan fury equal
to their own To his surprise no one followed the baying of a third
hound seemed to be silenced and checked the silence was broken only by
the sound of distant disputing voices and the uneasy trampling of hoofs
This was followed by two or three rifle shots in the distance but not
either in the direction of the quarters nor the Dows dwellinghouse
There evidently was some interruption in the pursuita diversion of
some kind had taken placebut what he knew not He could think of
no one who might have interfered on his behalf and the shouting and
wrangling seemed to be carried on in the accents of the one sectional
party He called cautiously to Cato The negro did not reply He crossed
to the tree and shook it impatiently Its boughs were empty Cato
was gone The miserable negro must have taken advantage of the first
diversion in his favor to escape But where and how there was nothing
left to indicate

As Courtland had taken little note of the trail he had no idea of his
own whereabouts He knew he must return to the fringe of cypress to be
able to cross the open field and gain the negro quarters where it was
still possible that Cato had fled Taking a general direction from the
few stars visible above the opening he began to retrace his steps But
he had no longer the negros woodcraft to guide him At times his feet
were caught in trailing vines which seemed to coil around his ankles
with ominous suggestiveness at times the yielding soil beneath his
tread showed his perilous proximity to the swamp as well as the fact
that he was beginning to incline towards that dread circle which is the
hopeless instinct of all lost and straying humanity Luckily the edge of
the swamp was more open and he would be enabled to correct his changed
course again by the position of the stars But he was becoming chilled
and exhausted by these fruitless efforts and at length after a more
devious and prolonged detour which brought him back to the swamp again
he resolved to skirt its edge in search of some other mode of issuance
Beyond him the light seemed stronger as of a more extended opening
or clearing and there was even a superficial gleam from the end of the
swamp itself as if from some ignis fatuus or the glancing of a pool of
unbroken water A few rods farther brought him to it and a full view of
the unencumbered expanse Beyond him far across the swamp he could see
a hillside bathed in the moonlight with symmetrical lines of small white
squares dotting its slopes and stretching down into a valley of gleaming
shafts pyramids and tombs It was the cemetery the white squares
on the hillside were the soldiers graves And among them even at that
distance uplifting solemnly like a reproachful phantom was the broken
shaft above the dust of Chester Brooks

With the view of that fateful spot which he had not seen since his last
meeting there with Sally Dows a flood of recollection rushed upon him
In the white mist that hung low along the farther edge of the swamp he
fancied he could see again the battery smoke through which the ghostly
figure of the dead rider had charged his gun three years before in
the vapory white plumes of a funereal plant in the long avenue he was
reminded of the light figure of Miss Sally as she appeared at their last
meeting In another moment in his already dazed condition he might
have succumbed to some sensuous memory of her former fascinations but
he threw it off savagely now with a quick and bitter recalling of her
deceit and his own weakness Turning his back upon the scene with a
halfsuperstitious tremor he plunged once more into the trackless
covert But he was conscious that his eyesight was gradually growing dim
and his strength falling He was obliged from time to time to stop and
rally his sluggish senses that seemed to grow heavier under some deadly
exhalation that flowed around him He even seemed to hear familiar
voicesbut that must be delusion At last he stumbled Throwing out an
arm to protect himself he came heavily down upon the ooze striking
a dull halfelastic root that seemedit must have been another
delusionto move beneath him and evenso confused were his senses
nowto strike back angrily upon his prostrate arm A sharp pain
ran from his elbow to shoulder and for a moment stung him to full
consciousness again There were voices surelythe voices of their
former pursuers If they were seeking to revenge themselves upon him for
Catos escape he was ready for them He cocked his revolver and stood
erect A torch flashed through the wood But even at that moment a film
came over his eyes he staggered and fell

An interval of helpless semiconsciousness ensued He felt himself
lifted by strong arms and carried forward his arm hanging uselessly at
his side The dank odor of the wood was presently exchanged for the free
air of the open field the flaming pineknot torches were extinguished
in the bright moonlight People pressed around him but so indistinctly
he could not recognize them All his consciousness seemed centred in
the burning throbbing pain of his arm He felt himself laid upon the
gravel the sleeve cut from his shoulder the cool sensation of the hot
and bursting skin bared to the night air and then a soft cool and
indescribable pressure upon a wound he had not felt before A voice
followedhigh lazily petulant and familiar to him and yet one he
strove in vain to recall

De LawdyGawd save us Miss Sally Wot yo doin dah Chile Chile Yo
ll kill yosef shuah

The pressure continued strange and potent even through his pain and
was then withdrawn And a voice that thrilled him said

Its the only thing to save him Hush ye chattering black crow Say
anything about this to a living soul and Ill have yo flogged Now
trot out the whiskey bottle and pour it down him


CHAPTER VII


When Courtlands eyes opened again he was in bed in his own room at
Redlands with the vivid morning sun occasionally lighting up the wall
whenever the closely drawn curtains were lightly blown aside by the
freshening breeze The whole events of the night might have been a
dream but for the insupportable languor which numbed his senses and
the torpor of his arm that swollen and discolored lay outside the
coverlet on a pillow before him Cloths that had been wrung out in
iced water were replaced upon it from time to time by Sophy Miss Dows
housekeeper who seated near his bedhead was lazily fanning him Their
eyes met

Broken he said interrogatively with a faint return of his old
deliberate manner glancing at his helpless arm

Deedy no cunnle Snake bite responded the negress

Snake bite repeated Courtland with languid interest what snake

Moccasin o copperheadif you doun know yosef which she replied
But its all right now honey De pizens drawd out and clean gone
Wot yer feels now is de whiskey De whiskey STAYS sah It gets into de
lubrications of de skin sah and has to be absobed

Some faint chord of memory was touched by the girls peculiar
vocabulary

Ah said Courtland quickly youre Miss Dows Sophy Then you can
tell me

Nuffin sah absomlutely nuffin interrupted the girl shaking her head
with impressive official dignity Its done gone fobid by de doctor
Yo re to lie dar and shut yor eye honey she added for the moment
reverting unconsciously to the native maternal tenderness of her race
and yo re not to bodder yosef ef school keeps o not De medical
man say distinctly sah she concluded sternly recalling her duty
again no conversation wid de patient

But Courtland had winning ways with all dependents But you will answer
me ONE question Sophy and Ill not ask another Hashe hesitated
in his still uncertainty as to the actuality of his experience and its
probable extenthasCatoescaped

If yo mean dat sassy bullnigger oberseer of yose cunnle HES
safe yo bet returned Sophy sharply Safe in his own quotahs night
afo las after braggin about the bloodhaowns he killed and safe ober
the county line yesday moanin after kicking up all dis rumpus If
dar is a sassy highfalutin nigger I jiss spisesits dat black nigger
Cato o yose Nowrelentingyo jiss wink yo eye honey
and dont excite yosef about sach black trash drap off to sleep
comforble Fo you doan get annuder word out o Sophy shuah

As if in obedience Courtland closed his eyes But even in his weak
state he was conscious of the blood coming into his cheek at Sophys
relentless criticism of the man for whom he had just periled his life
and position Much of it he felt was true but how far had he been a
dupe in his quixotic defense of a quarrelsome blusterer and cowardly
bully Yet there was the unmistakable shot and coldblooded attempt at
Catos assassination And there were the bloodhounds sent to track the
unfortunate man That was no dreambut a brutal inexcusable fact

The medical practitioner of Redlands he remembered was conservative
oldfashioned and diplomatic But his sympathies had been broadened by
some army experiences and Courtland trusted to some soldierly and frank
exposition of the matter from him Nevertheless Dr Maynard was first
healer and like Sophy professionally cautious The colonel had better
not talk about it now It was already two days old the colonel had been
nearly fortyeight hours in bed It was a regrettable affair but the
natural climax of longcontinued political and racial irritationand
not without GREAT provocation Assassination was a strong word could
Colonel Courtland swear that Cato was actually AIMED AT or was it not
merely a demonstration to frighten a bullying negro It might have been
necessary to teach him a lessonwhich the colonel by this time ought
to know could only be taught to these inferior races by FEAR The
bloodhounds Ah yeswell the bloodhounds were in fact only a
part of that wholesome discipline Surely Colonel Courtland was not so
foolish as to believe that even in the old slaveholding days planters
sent dogs after runaways to mangle and destroy THEIR OWN PROPERTY They
might as well at once let them escape No sir They were used only
to frighten and drive the niggers out of swamps brakes and
hidingplacesas no nigger had ever dared to face em Cato might lie
as much as he liked but everybody knew WHO it was that killed Major
Reeds hounds Nobody blamed the colonel for itnot even Major
Reedbut if the colonel had lived a little longer in the South hed
have known it wasnt necessary to do that in selfpreservation as the
hounds would never have gone for a white man But that was not a matter
for the colonel to bother about NOW He was doing well he had slept
nearly thirty hours there was no fever he must continue to doze off
the exhaustion of his powerful stimulant and he the doctor would
return later in the afternoon

Perhaps it was his very inability to grasp in that exhausted state the
full comprehension of the doctors meaning perhaps because the physical
benumbing of his brain was stronger than any mental excitement but he
slept again until the doctor reappeared Youre doing well enough now
colonel said the physician after a brief examination of his patient
and I think we can afford to wake you up a bit and even let you move
your arm Youre luckier than poor Tom Higbee who wont be able to
set his leg to the floor for three weeks to come I havent got all the
buckshot out of it yet that Jack Dumont put there the other night

Courtland started slightly Jack Dumont That was the name of Sally Dows
cousin of whom Champney had spoken He had resolutely put aside from his
returning memory the hazy recollection of the young girls voicethe
last thing he had heard that nightand the mystery that seemed to
surround it But there was no delusion in this cousinhis rival
and that of the equally deceived Champney He controlled himself and
repeated coldly

Jack Dumont

Yes But of course you knew nothing of all that while you were off
in the swamp there Yet by Jingo it was Dumonts shooting Higbee that
helped YOU to get off your nigger a darned sight more than YOUR killing
the dogs

I dont understand returned Courtland coldly

Well you see Dumont who had taken up Nothn principles I reckon
more to goad the Higbees and please Sally Dows than from any conviction
came over here that night Whether he suspected anything was up or
wanted to dare Higbee for bedevilment or was only dancing attendance on
Miss Sally no one knows But he rode slap into Highees party called
out If youre out hunting Tom heres a chance for your score
meaning their old vendetta feud and brings his shotgun up to his
shoulder Higbee wasnt quick enough Dumont lets fly drops Higbee and
then gallops off chased by the Reeds to avenge Higbee and followed
by the whole crowd to see the fun which was a little better than
niggerdriving And that let you and Cato out colonel

And Dumont

Got clean away to Foxboro Station leaving another score on his side
for the Reeds and Higbees to wipe out as best they can You Nothn men
dont believe in these sort of things colonel but taken as a straight
dash and hit o raiding that stroke of Sally Dows cousin was mighty
fine

Courtland controlled himself with difficulty The doctor had spoken
truly The hero of this miserable affair was HER cousinHIS RIVAL And
to himperhaps influenced by some pitying appeal of Miss Sally for the
man she had deceivedCourtland owed his life He instinctively drew a
quick sharp breath

Are you in pain

Not at all When can I get up

Perhaps tomorrow

And this arm

Better not use it for a week or two He stopped and glancing
paternally at the younger man added gravely but kindly If youll
take my unprofessional advice Colonel Courtland youll let this matter
simmer down It wont hurt you and your affairs here that folks have had
a taste of your quality and the nigger a lesson that his fellows wont
forget

I thank you returned Courtland coldly but I think I already
understand my duty to the company I represent and the Government I have
served

Possibly colonel said the doctor quietly but youll let an older
man remind you and the Government that you cant change the habits or
relations of two distinct races in a few years Your friend Miss Sally
Dowsalthough not quite in my way of thinkinghas never attempted
THAT

I am fully aware that Miss Dows possesses diplomatic accomplishments
and graces that I cannot lay claim to returned Courtland bitterly

The doctor lifted his eyebrows slightly and changed the subject

When he had gone Courtland called for writing materials He had already
made up his mind and one course alone seemed proper to him He wrote to
the president of the company detailing the circumstances that had just
occurred admitting the alleged provocation given by his overseer
but pointing out the terrorism of a moblaw which rendered his
own discipline impossible He asked that the matter be reported to
Washington and some measures taken for the protection of the freedmen
in the mean time he begged to tender his own resignation but he would
stay until his successor was appointed or the safety of his employees
secured Until then he should act upon his own responsibility and
according to his judgment He made no personal charges mentioned no
names asked for no exemplary prosecution or trial of the offenders but
only demanded a safeguard against a repetition of the offense His next
letter although less formal and official was more difficult It was
addressed to the commandant of the nearest Federal barracks who was an
old friend and former companioninarms He alluded to some conversation
they had previously exchanged in regard to the presence of a small
detachment of troops at Redlands during the elections which Courtland
at the time however had diplomatically opposed He suggested it now
as a matter of public expediency and prevention When he had sealed
the letters not caring to expose them to the espionage of the local
postmaster or his ordinary servants he intrusted them to one of Miss
Sallys own henchmen to be posted at the next office at Bitter Creek
Station ten miles distant

Unfortunately this duty accomplished the reaction consequent on
his still weak physical condition threw him back upon himself and his
memory He had resolutely refused to think of Miss Sally he had
been able to withstand the suggestions of her in the presence of her
handmaidsupposed to be potent in nursing and herblorewhom she
had detached to wait upon him and he had returned politely formal
acknowledgments to her inquiries He had determined to continue this
personal avoidance as far as possible until he was relieved on
the ground of that BUSINESS expediency which these events had made
necessary She would see that he was only accepting the arguments with
which she had met his previous advances Briefly he had recourse to
that hopeless logic by which a man proves to himself that he has no
reason for loving a certain woman and is as incontestably convinced
by the same process that he has And in the midst of it he weakly fell
asleep and dreamed that he and Miss Sally were walking in the cemetery
that a hideous snake concealed among some lilies over which the young
girl was bending had uplifted its triangular head to strike That he
seized it by the neck struggled with it until he was nearly exhausted
when it suddenly collapsed and shrunk leaving in his palm the limp
crushed and delicately perfumed little thread glove which he remembered
to have once slipped from her hand

When he awoke that perfume seemed to be still in the air distinct
from the fresh but homelier scents of the garden which stole through the
window A sense of delicious coolness came with the afternoon breeze
that faintly trilled the slanting slats of the blind with a slumberous
humming as of bees The golden glory of a sinking southern sun was
penciling the cheap paper on the wall with leafy tracery and glowing
arabesques But more than that the calm of some potent influenceor
some unseen presencewas upon him which he feared a movement might
dispel The chair at the foot of his bed was empty Sophy had gone
out He did not turn his head to look further his languid eyes falling
aimlessly upon the carpet at his bedside suddenly dilated For they fell
also on the smallest foot in the State

He started to his elbow but a soft hand was laid gently yet firmly upon
his shoulder and with a faint rustle of muslin skirts Miss Sally rose
from an unseen chair at the head of his bed and stood beside him

Dont stir connle I didnt sit where I could look in yor face for
fear of waking yo But Ill change seats now She moved to the chair
which Sophy had vacated drew it slightly nearer the bed and sat down

It was very kind of youto come said Courtland hesitatingly as with
a strong effort he drew his eyes away from the fascinating vision and
regained a certain cold composure but I am afraid my illness has been
greatly magnified I really am quite well enough to be up and about my
business if the doctor would permit it But I shall certainly manage to
attend to my duty tomorrow and I hope to be at your service

Meaning that yo dont care to see me NOW connle she said lightly
with a faint twinkle in her wise sweet eyes I thought of that but as
my business wouldnt wait I brought it to yo She took from the folds
of her gown a letter To his utter amazement it was the one he had given
his overseer to post to the commandant that morning To his greater
indignation the seal was broken

Who has dared he demanded half rising

Her little hand was thrust out half deprecatingly No one yo can
fight connle only ME I dont generally open other folks letters
and I wouldnt have done it for MYSELF I did for yo

For me

For yo I reckoned what yo MIGHT do and I told Sam to bring ME the
letters first I didnt mind what yo wrote to the companyfor theyll
take care of yo and their own eggs are all in the same basket I
didnt open THAT one but I did THIS when I saw the address It was as
I expected and yo d given yoself away For if yo had those soldiers
down here yo d have a row sure Dont move connle YO may not
care for that its in YOR line But folks will say that the soldiers
werent sent to prevent RIOTING but that Connle Courtland was using
his old comrades to keep order on his property at Govment expense Hol
on Hol on connle said the little figure rising and waving its
pretty arms with a mischievous simulation of terrified deprecation
Dont shoot Of course yo didnt mean THAT but thats about the way
that Sothn men will put it to yor Govment For she continued more
gently yet with the shrewdest twinkle in her gray eyes if yo really
thought the niggers might need Federal protection yo d have let ME
write to the commandant to send an escortnot to YO but to CATOthat
HE might be able to come back in safety Yo d have had yor soldiers
Id have had back my nigger whichdemurelyyo dont seem to worry
yoself much about connle and there isnt a Sothn man would have
objected But still more demurely and affectedly smoothing out her
crisp skirt with her little hands yo havent been troubling me much
with yor counsel lately

A swift and utterly new comprehension swept over Courtland For the
first time in his knowledge of her he suddenly grasped what was
perhaps the true conception of her character Looking at her clearly
now he understood the meaning of those pliant graces so unaffected
and yet always controlled by the reasoning of an unbiased intellect her
frank speech and plausible intonations Before him stood the trueborn
daughter of a long race of politicians All that he had heard of their
dexterity tact and expediency rose here incarnate with the added
grace of womanhood A strange sense of reliefperhaps a dawning of
hopestole over him

But how will this insure Catos safety hereafter or give protection to
the others he said fixing his eyes upon her

The future wont concern YO much connle if as yo say here yor
resignation is sent in and yor successor appointed she replied with
more gravity than she had previously shown

But you do not think I will leave YOU in this uncertainty he said
passionately He stopped suddenly his brow darkened I forgot he
added coldly you will be well protected YourCOUSINwill give you
the counsel of raceandcloser ties

To his infinite astonishment Miss Sally leaned forward in her chair
and buried her laughing face in both of her hands When her dimples
had become again visible she said with an effort Dont yo think
connle that as a peacemaker my cousin was even a bigger failure than
yoself

I dont understand stammered Courtland

Dont yo think she continued wiping her eyes demurely that if a
young woman about my size who had got perfectly tired and sick of
all this fuss made about yo because yo were a Nothn man managing
niggersif that young woman wanted to show her people what sort of a
radical and abolitionist a SOTHN man of their own sort might become
shed have sent for Jack Dumont as a sample Eh Only I declare
to goodness I never reckoned that he and Higbee would revive the
tomfooling of the vendetta and take to shootin each other at once

And your sending for your cousin was only a feint to protect me said
Courtland faintly

Perhaps he didnt have to be SENT for connle she said with a
slight touch of coquetry Suppose we say I LET HIM COME Hed be
hanging round for he has property here and wanted to get me to take it
up with mine in the company I knew what his new views and ideas were
and I thought Id better consult Champneywho being a foreigner and
an older resident than yo was quite neutral He didnt happen to tell
YO anything about itdid he connle she added with a grave mouth
but an indescribable twinkle in her eyes

Courtlands face darkened He didand he further told me Miss Dows
that he himself was your suitor and that you had refused him because of
the objections of your people

She raised her eyes to his swiftly and dropped them

And yo think I ought to have accepted him she said slowly

No butyou knowyou told mehe began hurriedly But she had
already risen and was shaking out the folds of her dress

Were not talking BUSINESS connleand business was my only excuse for
coming here and taking Sophys place Ill send her in to yo now

But Miss DowsMiss Sally

She stoppedhesitateda singular weakness for so selfcontained a
natureand then slowly produced from her pocket a second letterthe
one that Courtland had directed to the company I didnt read THIS
letter as I just told yo connle for I reckon I know whats in it
but I thought Id bring it with me too in case YO CHANGED YOR MIND

He raised himself on his pillow as she turned quickly away but in that
single vanishing glimpse of her bright face he saw what neither he nor
any one else had ever seen upon the face of Sally Dowsa burning blush

Miss Sally He almost leaped from the bed but she was gone There was
another rustle at the doorthe entrance of Sophy

Call her back Sophy quick he said

The negress shook her turbaned head Not much honey When Miss Sally
say she goesshe done gone shuah

But Sophy Perhaps something in the significant face of the girl
tempted him perhaps it was only an impulse of his forgotten youth
Sophy appealinglytell meis Miss Sally engaged to her cousin

Wat dat said Sophy in indignant scorn Miss Sally engaged to dat
Dumont What fo Yo re crazy No

Nor Champney Tell me Sophy has she a LOVER

For a moment the whites of Sophys eyes were uplifted in speechless
scorn Yo ask dat Yo lyin dar wid dat snakebit arm Yo lyin dar
and Miss Sallywho has only to whistle to call de fust quality in de
State raoun hercoming and going here wid you and trotting on yor
arrantsand yo ask dat Yes she has a lover and whats me she
CANT HELP IT and yo re her lover and whats me YO cant help it
either And yo cant back out of it nowbofe of yonebber Fo yo
re hers and shes yorsfo ebber For she sucked yo blood

What gasped Courtland aghast at what he believed to be the sudden
insanity of the negress

Yes Whars yor eyes whars yor years whos yo dat yo didnt see
nor heah nuffin When dey dragged yo outer de swamp dat nightwid de
snakebite freshen yor armdidnt SHE dat poh chiledat same Miss
Sallyfrow herself down on yo and put dat baby mouf of hers to de
wound and suck out de pizen and sabe de life ob yo at de risk ob her
own Say And if deys any troof in Hoodoo dont dat make yo one blood
and one soul Go way white man Im sick of yo Stop dar Lie down
dar Hol on connle for massys sake Well darIll call her back

And she did


Look heredont you knowit rather took me by surprise said
Champney a few days later with a hearty grip of the colonels
uninjured hand but I dont bear malice old fellow and by Jove it
was SUCH a sensible allround businesslike choice for the girl to
make that no wonder we never thought of it before Hang it all you see
a fellow was always so certain it would be something out of the way and
detrimental dont you know that would take the fancy of a girl like
thatsomebody like that cousin of hers or Higbee or even ME by Jove
that we never thought of looking beyond our nosesnever thought of the
BUSINESS And YOU all the time so cold and silent and matteroffact
about it But I congratulate you Youve got the business down on a safe
basis now and whats more youve got the one woman who can run it

They say he was a true prophet At least the Syndicate affairs
prospered and in course of time even the Reeds and the Higbees
participated in the benefits There were no more racial disturbances
only the districts polled a peaceful and SMALLER Democratic majority at
the next election There were not wanting those who alleged that Colonel
Courtland had simply become MRS COURTLANDS SUPERINTENDENT that she
had absorbed him as she had every one who had come under her influence
and that she would not rest until she had made him a Senator to
represent Mrs Courtland in the councils of the nation But when I last
dined with them in Washington ten years ago I found them both very
happy and comfortable and I remember that Mrs Courtlands remarks upon
Federal and State interests the proper education of young girls and
the management of the family were eminently wise and practical




THE CONSPIRACY OF MRS BUNKER


PART I


On the northerly shore of San Francisco Bay a line of bluffs terminates
in a promontory at whose base formed by the crumbling debris of the
cliff above there is a narrow stretch of beach salt meadow and scrub
oak The abrupt wall of rock behind it seems to isolate it as completely
from the mainland as the sea before it separates it from the opposite
shore In spite of its contiguity to San Franciscoopposite also but
hidden by the sharp reentering curve of coastthe locality was wild
uncultivated and unfrequented A solitary fishermans cabin half hidden
in the rocks was the only trace of habitation White drifts of seagulls
and pelican across the face of the cliff gray clouds of sandpipers
rising from the beach the dripping flight of ducks over the salt
meadows and the occasional splash of a seal from the rocks were the
only signs of life that could be seen from the decks of passing ships
And yet the fishermans cabin was occupied by Zephas Bunker and
his young wife and he had succeeded in wresting from the hard soil
pasturage for a cow and goats while his lateensailed fishingboat
occasionally rode quietly in the sheltered cove below

Three years ago Zephas Bunker an exwhaler had found himself stranded
on a San Francisco wharf and had hired out to a small Petaluma farmer
At the end of a year he had acquired little taste for the farmers
business but considerable for the farmers youthful daughter who
equally weary of small agriculture had consented to elope with him
in order to escape it They were married at Oakland he put his scant
earnings into a fishingboat discovered the site for his cabin and
brought his bride thither The novelty of the change pleased her
although perhaps it was but little advance on her previous humble
position Yet she preferred her present freedom to the bare restricted
home life of her past the perpetual presence of the restless sea was a
relief to the old monotony of the wheat field and its isolated drudgery
For Marys youthful fancy thinly sustained in childhood by the lightest
literary food had neither been stimulated nor disillusioned by her
marriage That practical experience which is usually the end of girlish
romance had left her still a child in sentiment The long absences
of her husband in his fishingboat kept her from wearying of or even
knowing his older and unequal companionship it gave her a freedom her
girlhood had never known yet added a protection that suited her still
childish dependency while it tickled her pride with its equality When
not engaged in her easy household duties in her threeroomed cottage or
the care of her rocky garden patch she found time enough to indulge her
fancy over the mysterious haze that wrapped the invisible city so near
and yet unknown to her in the sails that slipped in and out of the
Golden Gate but of whose destination she knew nothing and in the long
smoke trail of the mail steamer which had yet brought her no message
Like all dwellers by the sea her face and her thoughts were more
frequently turned towards it and as with them it also seemed to her
that whatever change was coming into her life would come across that
vast unknown expanse But it was here that Mrs Bunker was mistaken

It had been a sparkling summer morning The waves were running before
the dry northwest trade winds with crystalline but colorless brilliancy
Sheltered by the high northerly bluff the house and its garden were
exposed to the untempered heat of the cloudless sun refracted from the
rocky wall behind it Some tarpaulin and ropes lying among the rocks
were sticky and odorous the scrub oaks and manzanita bushes gave out
the aroma of baking wood occasionally a faint potpourri fragrance from
the hot wild roses and beach grass was blown along the shore even the
lingering odors of Bunkers vocation and of Mrs Bunkers cooking were
idealized and refined by the saline breath of the sea at the doors and
windows Mrs Bunker in the dazzling sun bending over her peas
and lettuces with a small hoe felt the comfort of her brown holland
sunbonnet Secure in her isolation she unbuttoned the neck of her gown
for air and did not put up the strand of black hair that had escaped
over her shoulder It was very hot in the lee of the bluff and very
quiet in that still air So quiet that she heard two distinct reports
following each other quickly but very faint and far She glanced
mechanically towards the sea Two merchantmen in midstream were shaking
out their wings for a long flight a pilot boat and coasting schooner
were rounding the point but there was no smoke from their decks She
bent over her work again and in another moment had forgotten it But
the heat with the dazzling reflection from the cliff forced her to
suspend her gardening and stroll along the beach to the extreme limit
of her domain Here she looked after the cow that had also strayed
away through the tangled bush for coolness The goats impervious to
temperature were basking in inaccessible fastnesses on the cliff
itself that made her eyes ache to climb Over an hour passed she was
returning and had neared her house when she was suddenly startled to
see the figure of a man between her and the cliff He was engaged in
brushing his dusty clothes with a handkerchief and although he saw her
coming and even moved slowly towards her continued his occupation
with a halfimpatient halfabstracted air Her feminine perception was
struck with the circumstance that he was in deep black with scarcely a
gleam of white showing even at his throat and that he wore a tall black
hat Without knowing anything of social customs it seemed to her that
his dress was inconsistent with his appearance there

Goodmorning he said lifting his hat with a preoccupied air Do you
live here

Yes she said wonderingly

Anybody else

My husband

I mean any other people Are there any other houses he said with a
slight impatience

No

He looked at her and then towards the sea I expect some friends who
are coming for me in a boat I suppose they can land easily here

Didnt you yourself land here just now she said quickly

He half hesitated and then as if scorning an equivocation made a
hasty gesture over her shoulder and said bluntly No I came over the
cliff

Down the cliff she repeated incredulously

Yes he said glancing at his clothes it was a rough scramble but
the goats showed me the way

And you were up on the bluff all the time she went on curiously

Yes You seeIhe stopped suddenly at what seemed to be the
beginning of a prearranged and plausible explanation as if impatient of
its weakness or hypocrisy and said briefly Yes I was there

Like most women more observant of his face and figure she did not miss
this lack of explanation He was a very goodlooking man of middle age
with a thin proud highbred face which in a country of bearded men
had the further distinction of being smoothly shaven She had never seen
any one like him before She thought he looked like an illustration of
some novel she had read but also somewhat melancholy worn and tired

Wont you come in and rest yourself she said motioning to the cabin

Thank you he said still half absently Perhaps Id better It may
be some time yet before they come

She led the way to the cabin entered the living rooma plainly
furnished little apartment between the bedroom and the kitchenpointed
to a large bamboo armchair and placed a bottle of whiskey and some
water on the table before him He thanked her again very gently poured
out some spirits in his glass and mixed it with water But when she
glanced towards him again he had apparently risen without tasting it
and going to the door was standing there with his hand in the breast
of his buttoned frock coat gazing silently towards the sea There was
something vaguely historical in his attitudeor what she thought might
be historicalas of somebody of great importance who had halted on the
eve of some great event at the door of her humble cabin

His apparent unconsciousness of her and of his surroundings his
preoccupation with something far beyond her ken far from piquing her
only excited her interest the more And then there was such an odd
sadness in his eyes

Are you anxious for your folks coming she said at last following
his outlook

Ioh no he returned quickly recalling himself theyll be sure to
comesooner or later No fear of that he added half smilingly half
wearily

Mrs Bunker passed into the kitchen where while apparently attending
to her household duties she could still observe her singular guest
Left alone he seated himself mechanically in the chair and gazed
fixedly at the fireplace He remained a long time so quiet and unmoved
in spite of the marked ostentatious clatter Mrs Bunker found it
necessary to make with her dishes that an odd fancy that he was
scarcely a human visitant began to take possession of her Yet she was
not frightened She remembered distinctly afterwards that far from
having any concern for herself she was only moved by a strange and
vague admiration of him

But her prolonged scrutiny was not without effect Suddenly he raised
his dark eyes and she felt them pierce the obscurity of her kitchen
with a quick suspicious impatient penetration which as they met hers
gave way however to a look that she thought was gently reproachful
Then he rose stretched himself to his full height and approaching the
kitchen door leaned listlessly against the doorpost

I dont suppose you are ever lonely here

No sir

Of course not You have yourself and husband Nobody interferes with
you You are contented and happy together

Mrs Bunker did not say what was the fact that she had never before
connected the sole companionship of her husband with her happiness
Perhaps it had never occurred to her until that moment how little it had
to do with it She only smiled gratefully at the change in her guests
abstraction

Do you often go to San Francisco he continued

I have never been there at all Some day I expect we will go there to
live

I wouldnt advise you to he said looking at her gravely I dont
think it will pay you Youll never be happy there as here Youll never
have the independence and freedom you have here Youll never be
your own mistress again But how does it happen you never were in San
Francisco he said suddenly

If he would not talk of himself here at least was a chance for Mrs
Bunker to say something She related how her family had emigrated from
Kansas across the plains and had taken up a location at Contra Costa
How she didnt care for it and how she came to marry the seafaring man
who brought her hereall with great simplicity and frankness and as
unreservedly as to a superior beingalbeit his attention wandered at
times and a rare but melancholy smile that he had apparently evoked
to meet her conversational advances became fixed occasionally Even his
dark eyes which had obliged Mrs Bunker to put up her hair and button
her collar rested upon her without seeing her

Then your husbands name is Bunker he said when she paused at last
Thats one of those Nantucket Quaker namessailors and whalers for
generationsand yours you say was MacEwan Well Mrs Bunker YOUR
family came from Kentucky to Kansas only lately though I suppose your
father calls himself a FreeStates man You ought to know something of
farming and cattle for your ancestors were old Scotch Covenanters who
emigrated a hundred years ago and were great stock raisers

All this seemed only the natural omniscience of a superior being And
Mrs Bunker perhaps was not pained to learn that her husbands family
was of a lower degree than her own But the strangers knowledge did not
end there He talked of her husbands businesshe explained the vast
fishing resources of the bay and coast He showed her how the large
colony of Italian fishermen were inimical to the interests of California
and to her husbandparticularly as a native American trader He told
her of the volcanic changes of the bay and coast line of the formation
of the rocky ledge on which she lived He pointed out to her its value
to the Government for defensive purposes and how it naturally commanded
the entrance of the Golden Gate far better than Fort Point and that it
ought to be in its hands If the Federal Government did not buy it of
her husband certainly the State of California should And here he fell
into an abstraction as deep and as gloomy as before He walked to the
window paced the floor with his hand in his breast went to the door
and finally stepped out of the cabin moving along the ledge of rocks to
the shore where he stood motionless

Mrs Bunker had listened to him with parted lips and eyes of eloquent
admiration She had never before heard anyone talk like THATshe had
not believed it possible that any one could have such knowledge Perhaps
she could not understand all he said but she would try to remember it
after he had gone She could only think now how kind it was of him that
in all this mystery of his coming and in the singular sadness that was
oppressing him he should try to interest her And thus looking at him
and wondering an idea came to her

She went into her bedroom and took down her husbands heavy pilot
overcoat and souwester and handed them to her guest

Youd better put them on if youre going to stand there she said

But I am not cold he said wonderingly

But you might be SEEN she said simply It was the first suggestion
that had passed between them that his presence there was a secret He
looked at her intently then he smiled and said I think youre right
for many reasons put the pilot coat over his frock coat removed
his hat with the gesture of a bow handed it to her and placed the
souwester in its stead Then for an instant he hesitated as if about
to speak but Mrs Bunker with a delicacy that she could not herself
comprehend at the moment hurried back to the cabin without giving him
an opportunity

Nor did she again intrude upon his meditations Hidden in his disguise
which to her eyes did not however seem to conceal his characteristic
figure he wandered for nearly an hour under the bluff and along the
shore returning at last almost mechanically to the cabin where
oblivious of his surroundings he reseated himself in silence by
the table with his cheek resting on his hand Presently her quick
experienced ear detected the sound of oars in their rowlocks she could
plainly see from her kitchen window a small boat with two strangers
seated at the stern being pulled to the shore With the same strange
instinct of delicacy she determined not to go out lest her presence
might embarrass her guests reception of his friends But as she turned
towards the living room she found he had already risen and was removing
his hat and pilot coat She was struck however by the circumstance
that not only did he exhibit no feeling of relief at his deliverance
but that a halfcynical halfsavage expression had taken the place of
his former melancholy As he went to the door the two gentlemen hastily
clambered up the rocks to greet him

Jim reckoned it was you hangin round the rocks but I couldnt tell at
that distance Seemed you borrowed a hat and coat Wellits all fixed
and weve no time to lose Theres a coasting steamer just dropping down
below the Heads and it will take you aboard But I can tell you youve
kicked up a hll of a row over there He stopped evidently at some
sign from her guest The rest of the mans speech followed in a hurried
whisper which was stopped again by the voice she knew No Certainly
not The next moment his tall figure was darkening the door of the
kitchen his hand was outstretched Goodby Mrs Bunker and many
thanks for your hospitality My friends here he turned grimly to the
men behind him think I ought to ask you to keep this a secret even
from your husband I DONT They also think that I ought to offer you
money for your kindness I DONT But if you will honor me by keeping
this ring in remembrance of ithe took a heavy seal ring from his
fingerits the only bit of jewelry I have about meIll be very
glad Goodby She felt for a moment the firm soft pressure of his
long thin fingers around her own and thenhe was gone The sound of
retreating oars grew fainter and fainter and was lost The same reserve
of delicacy which now appeared to her as a duty kept her from going to
the window to watch the destination of the boat No he should go as he
came without her supervision or knowledge

Nor did she feel lonely afterwards On the contrary the silence and
solitude of the isolated domain had a new charm They kept the memory of
her experience intact and enabled her to refill it with his presence
She could see his tall figure again pausing before her cabin without
the incongruous association of another personality she could hear his
voice again unmingled with one more familiar For the first time the
regular absence of her husband seemed an essential good fortune instead
of an accident of their life For the experience belonged to HER and
not to him and her together He could not understand it he would have
acted differently and spoiled it She should not tell him anything of
it in spite of the strangers suggestion which of course he had only
made because he didnt know Zephas as well as she did For Mrs Bunker
was getting on rapidly it was her first admission of the conjugal
knowledge that ones husband is inferior to the outside estimate of
him The next stepthe belief that he was deceiving HER as he was
THEMwould be comparatively easy

Nor should she show him the ring The stranger had certainly never said
anything about that It was a heavy ring with a helmeted head carved on
its red carnelian stone and what looked like strange letters around it
It fitted her third finger perfectly but HIS fingers were small and
he had taken it from his little finger She should keep it herself Of
course if it had been money she would have given it to Zephas but the
stranger knew that she wouldnt take money How firmly he had said that
I dont She felt the warm blood fly to her fresh young face at the
thought of it He had understood her She might be living in a
poor cabin doing all the housework herself and her husband only a
fisherman but he had treated her like a lady

And so the afternoon passed The outlying fog began to roll in at the
Golden Gate obliterating the headland and stretching a fleecy bar
across the channel as if shutting out from vulgar eyes the way that he
had gone Night fell but Zephas had not yet come This was unusual
for he was generally as regular as the afternoon trades which blew
him there There was nothing to detain him in this weather and at this
season She began to be vaguely uneasy then a little angry at this new
development of his incompatibility Then it occurred to her for the
first time in her wifehood to think what she would do if he were lost
Yet in spite of some pain terror and perplexity at the possibility
her dominant thought was that she would be a free woman to order her
life as she liked

It was after ten before his lateen sail flapped in the little cove She
was waiting to receive him on the shore His goodhumored hirsute face
was slightly apologetic in expression but flushed and disturbed with
some new excitement to which an extra glass or two of spirits had
apparently added intensity The contrast between his evident
indulgence and the previous abstemiousness of her late guest struck her
unpleasantly WellI declare she said indignantly so THATS what
kept you

No he said quickly theres been awful times over in Frisco
Everybody just wild and the Vigilance Committee in session Jo
Hendersons killed Shot by Wynyard Marion in a duel Hell be lynched
sure as a gun if they ketch him

But I thought men who fought duels always went free

Yes but this aint no common duel they say the whole thing was
planned beforehand by them Southern fireeaters to get rid o Henderson
because hes a Northern man and antislavery and that they picked out
Colonel Marion to do it because he was a dead shot They got him to
insult Henderson so he was bound to challenge Marion and that giv
Marion the chyce of weppings It was a reglar put up job to kill him

And whats all this to do with you she asked with irritation

Hold on wont you and Ill tell you I was pickin up nets off
Saucelito about noon when I was hailed by one of them Vigilance tugs
and they set me to stand off and on the shore and watch that Marion
didnt get away while they were scoutin inland Ye see THE DUEL TOOK
PLACE JUST OVER THE BLUFF THEREBEHIND YEand they allowed that
Marion had struck away north for Mendocino to take ship there For after
overhaulin his seconds boat they found out that they had come away
from Saucelito ALONE But they sent a tug around by sea to Mendocino to
head him off there while theyre closin in around him inland Theyre
bound to catch him sooner or later But you aint listenin Mollie

She wasin every fibrebut with her head turned towards the window
and the invisible Golden Gate through which the fugitive had escaped
For she saw it all nowthat glorious visionher highbred handsome
guest and Wynyard Marion were one and the same person And this rough
commonplace man before herher own husbandhad been basely set to
capture him


PART II


During that evening and the next Mrs Bunker without betraying her
secret or exciting the least suspicion on the part of her husband
managed to extract from him not only a rough description of Marion which
tallied with her own impressions but a short history of his career He
was a famous politician who had held high office in the South he was an
accomplished lawyer he had served in the army he was a fiery speaker
he had a singular command of men He was unmarried but there were queer
stories of his relations with some of the wives of prominent officials
and there was no doubt that he used them in some of his political
intrigues He Zephas would bet something that it was a woman who had
helped him off Did she speak

Yes she had spoken It made her sick to sit there and hear such
stories Because a man did not agree with some people in politics it
was perfectly awful to think how they would abuse him and take away his
character Men were so awfully jealous too if another man happened to
be superior and finelooking there wasnt anything bad enough for them
to say about him No she wasnt a slavery sympathizer either and
hadnt anything to do with man politics although she was a Southern
woman and the MacEwans had come from Kentucky and owned slaves Of
course he Zephas whose ancestors were Cape Cod Quakers and had always
been sailors couldnt understand She did not know what he meant by
saying what a long tail our cats got but if he meant to call her
a cat and was going to use such language to her he had better have
stayed in San Francisco with his Vigilance friends And perhaps it would
have been better if he had stayed there before he took her away from her
parents at Martinez Then she wouldnt have been left on a desert rock
without any chance of seeing the world or ever making any friends or
acquaintances

It was their first quarrel Discreetly made up by Mrs Bunker in some
alarm at betraying herself honestly forgiven by Zephas in a rude
remorseful consciousness of her limited life One or two nights later
when he returned it was with a mingled air of mystery and satisfaction
Well Mollie he said cheerfully it looks as if your pets were not
as bad as I thought them

My pets repeated Mrs Bunker with a faint rising of color

Well I call these Southern Chivs your pets Mollie because you stuck
up for them so the other night But never mind that now What do you
suppose has happened Jim Rider you know the Southern banker and
speculator whos a regular big Injin among the Chivs he sent Cap
Simmons down to the wharf while I was unloadin to come up and see him
Well I went and what do yu think He told me he was gettin up an
American Fishin Company and wanted me to take charge of a firstclass
schooner on shares Said he heard of me afore and knew I was an
American and a white man and just the chap ez could knock them
Eytalians outer the market

Yes interrupted Mrs Bunker quickly but emphatically the fishing
interest ought to be American and protected by the State with regular
charters and treaties

I say Mollie said her astonished but admiring husband youve been
readin the papers or listenin to stump speakin sure

Go on returned Mrs Bunker impatiently and say what happened next

Well returned Zephas I first thought you see that it had suthin
to do with that Marion business particklerly ez folks allowed he was
hidin somewhere yet and they wanted me to run him off So I thought
Rider might as well know that I wasnt to be bribed so I ups and tells
him how Id been lyin off Saucelito the other day workin for the
other side agin him With that he laughs says he didnt want any better
friends than me but that I must be livin in the backwoods not to
know that Wynyard Marion had escaped and was then at sea on his way
to Mexico or Central America Then we agreed to terms and the long and
short of it is Mollie that Im to have the schooner with a hundred and
fifty dollars a month and ten per cent shares after a year Looks like
biz eh Mollie old girl but you dont seem pleased

She had put aside the arm with which he was drawing her to him and
had turned her white face away to the window So HE had gonethis
strangerthis one friend of her lifeshe would never see him again
and all that would ever come of it was this pecuniary benefit to her
husband who had done nothing He would not even offer her money but he
had managed to pay his debt to her in this way that their vulgar poverty
would appreciate And this was the end of her dream

You dont seem to take it in Mollie continued the surprised Zephas
It means a house in Frisco and a little cabin for you on the schooner
when you like

I dont want it I wont have it I shall stay here she burst out
with a halfpassionate halfchildish cry and ran into her bedroom
leaving the astonished Zephas helpless in his awkward consternation

By Gum I must take her to Frisco right off or shell be havin the
high strikes here alone I oughter knowed it would come to this But
although he consulted Cap Simmons the next day who informed him it
was all womans ways when struck and advised him to pay out all the
line he could at such delicate moments she had no recurrence of the
outbreak On the contrary for days and weeks following she seemed
calmer older and more growed up although she resisted changing her
seashore dwelling for San Francisco she accompanied him on one or two
of his deep sea trips down the coast and seemed happier on their
southern limits She had taken to reading the political papers and
speeches and some cheap American histories Captain Bunkers crew
profoundly convinced that their skippers wife was a womans rights
fanatic with the baleful qualities of sea lawyer superadded marveled
at his bringing her

It was on returning home from one of these trips that they touched
briefly at San Francisco where the Secretary of the Fishing Company
came on board Mrs Bunker was startled to recognize in him one of the
two gentlemen who had taken Mr Marion off in the boat but as he did
not appear to recognize her even after an awkward introduction by her
husband she would have recovered her equanimity but for a singular
incident As her husband turned momentarily away the Secretary with a
significant gesture slipped a letter into her hand She felt the blood
rush to her face as with a smile he moved away to follow her husband
She came down to the little cabin and impatiently tore open the
envelope which bore no address A small folded note contained the
following lines


I never intended to burden you with my confidence but the discretion
tact and courage you displayed on our first meeting and what I know
of your loyalty since have prompted me to trust myself again to your
kindness even though you are now aware whom you have helped and the
risks you ran My friends wish to communicate with me and to forward to
me from time to time certain papers of importance which owing to the
tyrannical espionage of the Government would be discovered and stopped
in passing through the express or postoffice These papers will be left
at your house but here I must trust entirely to your wit and judgment
as to the way in which they should be delivered to my agent at the
nearest Mexican port To facilitate your action your husband will
receive directions to pursue his course as far south as Todos Santos
where a boat will be ready to take charge of them when he is sighted I
know I am asking a great favor but I have such confidence in you that I
do not even ask you to commit yourself to a reply to this If it can
be done I know that you will do it if it cannot I will understand and
appreciate the reason why I will only ask you that when you are ready
to receive the papers you will fly a small red pennant from the little
flagstaff among the rocks Believe me your friend and grateful debtor

Mrs Bunker cast a hasty glance around her and pressed the letter
to her lips It was a sudden consummation of her vaguest halfformed
wishes the realization of her wildest dreams To be the confidante of
the gallant but melancholy hero in his lonely exile and persecution was
to satisfy all the unformulated romantic fancies of her girlish reading
to be later perhaps the Flora Macdonald of a middleaged Prince
Charlie did not however evoke any ludicrous associations in her mind
Her feminine fancy exalted the escaped duelist and alleged assassin into
a social martyr His actual small political intrigues and ignoble aims
of office seemed to her little different from those aspirations of
royalty which she had read aboutas perhaps they were Indeed it is to
be feared that in foolish little Mrs Bunker Wynyard Marion had found
the old feminine adoration of pretension and privilege which every
rascal has taken advantage of since the flood

Howbeit the next morning after she had returned and Zephas had sailed
away she flew a red bandana handkerchief on the little flagstaff before
the house A few hours later a boat appeared mysteriously from around
the Point Its only occupanta common sailorasked her name and
handed her a sealed package Mrs Bunkers invention had already been
at work She had created an aunt in Mexico for whom she had with some
ostentation made some small purchases while in San Francisco When her
husband spoke of going as far south as Todos Santos she begged him to
deliver the parcel to her aunts messenger and even addressed it boldly
to her Inside the outer wrapper she wrote a note to Marion which with
a new and amazing diffidence she composed and altered a dozen times at
last addressing the following in a large schoolgirl hand Sir I obey
your commands to the last Whatever your oppressors or enemies may do
you can always rely and trust upon She who in deepest sympathy signs
herself ever Mollie Rosalie MacEwan The substitution of her maiden
name in full seemed in her simplicity to be a delicate exclusion of
her husband from the affair and a certain disguise of herself to alien
eyes The superscription To Mrs Marion MacEwan from Mollie Bunker to
be called for by hand at Todos Santos also struck her as a marvel of
ingenuity The package was safely and punctually delivered by Zephas
who brought back a small packet directed to her which on private
examination proved to contain a letter addressed to J E Kirby to
be called for with the hurried line A thousand thanks W M Mrs
Bunker drew a long quick breath He might have written more he might
havebut the wish remained still unformulated The next day she ran up
a signal the same boat and solitary rower appeared around the Point
and took the package A week later when her husband was ready for sea
she again hoisted her signal It brought a return package for Mexico
which she inclosed and readdressed and gave to her husband The
recurrence of this incident apparently struck a bright idea from the
simple Zephas

Look here Mollie why dont you come YOURSELF and see your aunt I
cant go into port without a license and them port charges cost a heap
o red tape for theyve got a Filibuster scare on down there just
now but you can go ashore in the boat and Ill get permission from the
Secretary to stand off and wait for you there for twentyfour hours
Mrs Bunker flushed and paled at the thought She could see him The
letter would be sufficient excuse the distrust suggested by her husband
would give color to her delivering it in person There was perhaps a
brief twinge of conscience in taking this advantage of Zephas kindness
but the next moment with that peculiar logic known only to the sex she
made the unfortunate mans suggestion a condonation of her deceit SHE
hadnt asked to go HE had offered to take her He had only himself to
thank

Meantime the political excitement in which she had become a partisan
without understanding or even conviction presently culminated with the
Presidential campaign and the election of Abraham Lincoln The intrigues
of Southern statesmen were revealed in open expression and echoed in
California by those citizens of Southern birth and extraction who
had long held place power and opinion there There were rumors
of secession of California joining the South or of her founding an
independent Pacific Empire A note from J E Kirby informed Mrs
Bunker that she was to carefully retain any correspondence that might be
in her hands until further orders almost at the same time that Zephas
as regretfully told her that his projected Southern trip had been
suspended Mrs Bunker was disappointed and yet in some singular
conditions of her feelings felt relieved that her meeting with Marion
was postponed It is to be feared that some dim conviction unworthy
a partisan that in the magnitude of political events her own petty
personality might be overlooked by her hero tended somewhat to her
resignation

Meanwhile the seasons had changed The winter rains had set in the
trade winds had shifted to the southeast and the cottage although
strengthened enlarged and made more comfortable through the good
fortunes of the Bunkers was no longer sheltered by the cliff but
was exposed to the full strength of the Pacific gales There were long
nights when she could hear the rain fall monotonously on the shingles
or startle her with a short sharp reveille en the windows there were
brief days of flying clouds and drifting sunshine and intervals of
dull gray shadow when the heaving white breakers beyond the Gate slowly
lifted themselves and sank before her like wraiths of warning At such
times in her accepted solitude Mrs Bunker gave herself up to strange
moods and singular visions the more audacious and more striking it
seemed to her from their very remoteness and the difficulty she was
beginning to have in materializing them The actual personality of
Wynyard Marion as she knew it in her one interview had become very
shadowy and faint in the months that passed yet when the days were
heavy she sometimes saw herself standing by his side in some vague
tropical surroundings and hailed by the multitude as the faithful wife
and consort of the great Leader President Emperorshe knew not what
Exactly how this was to be managed and the manner of Zephas effacement
from the scene never troubled her childish fancy and it is but fair
to say her womans conscience In the logic before alluded to it
seemed to her that all ethical responsibility for her actions rested
with the husband who had unduly married her Nor were those visions
always roseate In the wild declamation of that exciting epoch which
filled the newspapers there was talk of short shrift with traitors So
there were days when the sudden onset of a squall of hail against her
window caused her to start as if she had heard the sharp fusillade of
that file of muskets of which she had sometimes read in history

One day she had a singular fright She had heard the sound of oars
falling with a precision and regularity unknown to her She was startled
to see the approach of a large eightoared barge rowed by men in
uniform with two officers wrapped in cloaks in the stern sheets and
before them the glitter of musket barrels The two officers appeared to
be conversing earnestly and occasionally pointing to the shore and the
bluff above For an instant she trembled and then an instinct of revolt
and resistance followed She hurriedly removed the ring which she
usually wore when alone from her finger slipped it with the packet
under the mattress of her bed and prepared with blazing eyes to face
the intruders But when the boat was beached the two officers with
scarcely a glance towards the cottage proceeded leisurely along the
shore Relieved yet it must be confessed a little piqued at their
indifference she snatched up her hat and sallied forth to confront
them

I suppose you dont know that this is private property she said
sharply

The group halted and turned towards her The orderly who was following
turned his face aside and smiled The younger officer demurely lifted
his cap The elder gray handsome in a generals uniform after a
moments halfastounded halfamused scrutiny of the little figure
gravely raised his gauntleted fingers in a military salute

I beg your pardon madam but I am afraid we never even thought of
that We are making a preliminary survey for the Government with a
possible view of fortifying the bluff It is very doubtful if you will
be disturbed in any rights you may have but if you are the Government
will not fail to make it good to you He turned carelessly to the aide
beside him I suppose the bluff is quite inaccessible from here

I dont know about that general They say that Marion after he killed
Henderson escaped down this way said the young man

Indeed what good was that How did he get away from here

They say that Mrs Fairfax was hanging round in a boat waiting for
him The story of the escape is all out now

They moved away with a slight perfunctory bow to Mrs Bunker only the
younger officer noting that the pert pretty little Western woman wasnt
as sharp and snappy to his superior as she had at first promised to be

She turned back to the cottage astounded angry and vaguely alarmed
Who was this Mrs Fairfax who had usurped her fame and solitary
devotion There was no woman in the boat that took him off it was
equally well known that he went in the ship alone If they had heard
that some woman was with him herewhy should they have supposed it was
Mrs Fairfax Zephas might know somethingbut he was away The thought
haunted her that day and the next On the third came a more startling
incident

She had been wandering along the edge of her domain in a state of
restlessness which had driven her from the monotony of the house when
she heard the barking of the big Newfoundland dog which Zephas had
lately bought for protection and company She looked up and saw the boat
and its solitary rower at the landing She ran quickly to the house to
bring the packet As she entered she started back in amazement For the
sittingroom was already in possession of a woman who was seated calmly
by the table

The stranger turned on Mrs Bunker that frankly insolent glance and
deliberate examination which only one woman can give another In that
glance Mrs Bunker felt herself in the presence of a superior even if
her own eyes had not told her that in beauty attire and bearing the
intruder was of a type and condition far beyond her own or even that of
any she had known It was the more crushing that there also seemed to be
in this haughty woman the same incongruousness and sharp contrast to the
plain and homely surroundings of the cottage that she remembered in HIM

Yo aw Mrs Bunker I believe she said in languid Southern accents
How de doh

I am Mrs Bunker said Mrs Bunker shortly

And so this is where Cunnle Marion stopped when he waited fo the
boat to take him off said the stranger glancing lazily around and
delaying with smiling insolence the explanation she knew Mrs Bunker was
expecting The cunnle said it was a pooh enough place but I dont see
it I reckon however he was too worried to judge and glad enough to
get off Yo ought to have made him talkhe generally dont want much
prompting to talk to women if theyre pooty

He didnt seem in a hurry to go said Mrs Bunker indignantly The
next moment she saw her error even before the cruel handsome smile of
her unbidden guest revealed it

I thought so she said lazily this IS the place and heres where the
cunnle stayed Only yo oughtnt have given him and yoself away to the
first stranger quite so easy The cunnle might have taught yo THAT the
two or three hours he was with yo

What do you want with me demanded Mrs Bunker angrily

I want a letter yo have for me from Cunnle Marion

I have nothing for you said Mrs Bunker I dont know who you are

You ought to considering youve been acting as messenger between the
cunnle and me said the lady coolly

Thats not true said Mrs Bunker hotly to combat an inward sinking

The lady rose with a lazy languid grace walked to the door and called
still lazily O Pedro

The solitary rower clambered up the rocks and appeared on the cottage
threshold

Is this the lady who gave you the letters for me and to whom you took
mine

Si senora

They were addressed to a Mr Kirby said Mrs Bunker sullenly How
was I to know they were for Mrs Kirby

Mr Kirby Mrs Kirby and myself are all the same You dont suppose
the cunnle would give my real name and address Did you address yor
packet to HIS real name or to some one else Did you let your husband
know who they were for

Oddly a sickening sense of the meanness of all these deceits and
subterfuges suddenly came over Mrs Bunker Without replying she went
to her bedroom and returned with Colonel Marions last letter which she
tossed into her visitors lap

Thank yo Mrs Bunker Ill be sure to tell the cunnle how careful yo
were not to give up his correspondence to everybody Itll please him
mo than to hear yo are wearing his ringwhich everybody knowsbefore
people

He gave it to mehehe knew I wouldnt take money said Mrs Bunker
indignantly

He didnt have any to give said the lady slowly as she removed the
envelope from her letter and looked up with a dazzling but cruel smile
A Sothn gentleman dont fill up his pockets when he goes out to
fight He dont tuck his maws Bible in his breastpocket clap his dear
aunties locket big as a cheese plate over his heart nor let his sole
leather cigyar case that his gyrl gave him lie round him in spots when
he goes out to take another gentlemans fire He leaves that to Yanks

Did you come here to insult my husband said Mrs Bunker in the rage
of desperation

To insult yo husband WellI came here to get a letter that his wife
received from his political and natural enemy andperhaps I DID With
a side glance at Mrs Bunkers crimson cheek she added carelessly I
have nothing against Captain Bunker hes a straightforward man and
must go with his kind He helped those hounds of Vigilantes because he
believes in them We couldnt bribe him if we wanted to And we dont

If she only knew something of this womans relations to Marionwhich
she only instinctively suspectedand could retaliate upon her Mrs
Bunker felt she would have given up her life at that moment

Colonel Marion seems to find plenty that he can bribe she said
roughly and Ive yet to know who YOU are to sit in judgment on them
Youve got your letter take it and go When he wants to send you
another through me somebody else must come for it not you Thats
all

She drew back as if to let the intruder pass but the lady without
moving a muscle finished the reading of her letter then stood
up quietly and began carefully to draw her handsome cloak over her
shoulders Yo want to know who I am Mrs Bunker she said arranging
the velvet collar under her white oval chin Well Im a Sothn woman
from Figinya and Im Figinyan first last and all the time She shook
out her sleeves and the folds of her cloak I believe in State rights
and slaveryif you know what that means I hate the North I hate the
East I hate the West I hate this nigger Government Id kill that man
Lincoln quicker than lightning She began to draw down the fingers of
her gloves holding her shapely hands upright before her Im hard and
fast to the Cause I gave up house and niggers for it She began to
button her gloves at the wrist with some difficulty tightly setting
together her beautiful lips as she did so I gave up my husband for
it and I went to the man who loved it better and had risked more for it
than ever he had Cunnle Marions my friend Im Mrs Fairfax
Josephine Hardee that was HIS disciple and follower Well maybe those
puritanical Nothn folks might give it another name

She moved slowly towards the door but on the threshold paused as
Colonel Marion had and came back to Mrs Bunker with an outstretched
hand I dont see that yo and me need quoll I didnt come here for
that I came here to see yor husband and seeing YO I thought it was
only right to talk squarely to yo as yo understand I WOULDNT talk to
yor husband Mrs Bunker I want yor husband to take me awayI want
him to take me to the cunnle If I tried to go in any other way Id
be watched spied upon and followed and only lead those hounds on his
track I dont expect yo to ASK yo husband for me but only not to
interfere when I do

There was a touch of unexpected weakness in her voice and a look of pain
in her eyes which was not unlike what Mrs Bunker had seen and pitied in
Marion But they were the eyes of a woman who had humbled her and Mrs
Bunker would have been unworthy her sex if she had not felt a cruel
enjoyment in it Yet the dominance of the stranger was still so strong
that she did not dare to refuse the proffered hand She however
slipped the ring from her finger and laid it in Mrs Fairfaxs palm

You can take that with you she said with a desperate attempt to
imitate the others previous indifference I shouldnt like to deprive
you and YOUR FRIEND of the opportunity of making use of it again As for
MY husband I shall say nothing of you to him as long as you say nothing
to him of mewhich I suppose is what you mean

The insolent look came back to Mrs Fairfaxs face I reckon yo re
right she said quietly putting the ring in her pocket as she fixed
her dark eyes on Mrs Bunker and the ring may be of use again
Goodby Mrs Bunker

She waved her hand carelessly and turning away passed out of the house
A moment later the boat and its two occupants pushed from the shore and
disappeared round the Point

Then Mrs Bunker looked round the room and down upon her empty finger
and knew that it was the end of her dream It was all over nowindeed
with the picture of that proud insolent woman before her she wondered
if it had ever begun This was the woman she had allowed herself to
think SHE might be This was the woman HE was thinking of when he sat
there this was the Mrs Fairfax the officers had spoken of and who
had made herMrs Bunkerthe gobetween for their lovemaking All
the work that she had done for him the deceit she had practiced on her
husband was to bring him and this woman together And they both knew
it and had no doubt laughed at her and her pretensions

It was with a burning cheek that she thought how she had intended to go
to Marion and imagined herself arriving perhaps to find that shameless
woman already there In her vague unformulated longings she had never
before realized the degradation into which her foolish romance might
lead her She saw it now that humiliating moral lesson we are all apt
to experience in the accidental display of our own particular vices in
the person we hate she had just felt in Mrs Fairfaxs presence With
it came the paralyzing fear of her husbands discovery of her secret
Secure as she had been in her dull belief that he had in some way
wronged her by marrying her she for the first time began to doubt if
this condoned the deceit she had practiced on him The tribute Mrs
Fairfax had paid himthis appreciation of his integrity and honesty
by an enemy and a woman like herselftroubled her frightened her and
filled her with her first jealousy What if this woman should tell him
all what if she should make use of him as Marion had of her Zephas was
a strong Northern partisan but was he proof against the guileful
charms of such a devil She had never thought before of questioning his
fidelity to her she suddenly remembered now some rough pleasantries of
Captain Simmons in regard to the inconstancy of his calling No there
was but one thing for her to do she would make a clean breast to him
she would tell him everything she had done except the fatal fancy that
compelled her to it She began to look for his coming now with alternate
hope and fearwith unabated impatience The night that he should have
arrived passed slowly morning came but not Zephas When the mist had
lifted she ran impatiently to the rocks and gazed anxiously towards the
lower bay There were a few gray sails scarce distinguishable above
the grayer waterbut they were not his She glanced half mechanically
seaward and her eyes became suddenly fixed There was no mistake She
knew the rigshe could see the familiar white lapstreak as the vessel
careened on the starboard tackit was her husbands schooner slowly
creeping out of the Golden Gate


PART III


Her first wild impulse was to run to the cove for the little dingey
always moored there and to desperately attempt to overtake him But
the swift consciousness of its impossibility was followed by a dull
bewildering torpor that kept her motionless helplessly following the
vessel with straining eyes as if they could evoke some response from
its decks She was so lost in this occupation that she did not see that
a pilotboat nearly abreast of the cove had put out a twooared gig
which was pulling quickly for the rocks When she saw it she trembled
with the instinct that it brought her intelligence She was right
it was a brief note from her husband informing her that he had been
hurriedly dispatched on a short sea cruise that in order to catch the
tide he had not time to go ashore at the bluff but he would explain
everything on his return Her relief was only partial she was already
experienced enough in his vocation to know that the excuse was a feeble
one He could easily have fetched the bluff in tacking out of the Gate
and have signaled to her to board him in her own boat The next day she
locked up her house rowed round the Point to the Embarcadero where
the Bay steamboats occasionally touched and took up passengers to San
Francisco Captain Simmons had not seen her husband this last trip
indeed did not know that he had gone out of the Bay Mrs Bunker was
seized with a desperate idea She called upon the Secretary of the
Fishing Trust That gentle man was businesslike but neither expansive
nor communicative Her husband had NOT been ordered out to sea by them
she ought to know that Captain Bunker was now his own master choosing
his own fishing grounds and his own times and seasons He was not
aware of any secret service for the Company in which Captain Bunker was
engaged He hoped Mrs Bunker would distinctly remember that the little
matter of the duel to which she referred was an old bygone affair
and never anything but a personal matter in which the Fishery had no
concern whatever and in which HE certainly should not again engage He
would advise Mrs Bunker if she valued her own good and especially her
husbands to speedily forget all about it These were ugly times as
it was If Mrs Bunkers services had not been properly rewarded or
considered it was certainly a great shame but really HE could not be
expected to make it good Certain parties had cost him trouble enough
already Besides really she must see that his position between her
husband whom he respected and a certain other party was a delicate
one But Mrs Bunker heard no more She turned and ran down the
staircase carrying with her a burning cheek and blazing eye that
somewhat startled the complacent official

She did not remember how she got home again She had a vague
recollection of passing through the crowded streets wondering if the
people knew that she was an outcast deserted by her husband deceived
by her ideal hero repudiated by her friends Men had gathered in
knots before the newspaper offices excited and gesticulating over the
bulletin boards that had such strange legends as The Crisis Details
of an Alleged Conspiracy to Overthrow the Government The Assassin of
Henderson to the Fore Again Rumored Arrests on the Mexican Frontier
Sometimes she thought she understood the drift of them even fancied
they were the outcome of her visitas if her very presence carried
treachery and suspicion with itbut generally they only struck her
benumbed sense as a dull meaningless echo of something that had
happened long ago When she reached her house late that night the
familiar solitude of shore and sea gave her a momentary relief but with
it came the terrible conviction that she had forfeited her right to it
that when her husband came back it would be hers no longer and that
with their meeting she would know it no more For through all her
childish vacillation and imaginings she managed to cling to one
steadfast resolution She would tell him EVERYTHING and know the worst
Perhaps he would never come perhaps she should not be alive to meet
him

And so the days and nights slowly passed The solitude which her
previous empty deceit had enabled her to fill with such charming visions
now in her awakened remorse seemed only to protract her misery Had she
been a more experienced though even a more guilty woman she would have
suffered less Without sympathy or counsel without even the faintest
knowledge of the world or its standards of morality to guide her she
accepted her isolation and friendlessness as a necessary part of her
wrongdoing Her only criterion was her enemyMrs Fairfaxand SHE
could seek her relief by joining her lover but Mrs Bunker knew now
that she herself had never had oneand was alone Mrs Fairfax had
broken openly with her husband but SHE had DECEIVED hers and the
experience and reckoning were still to come In her miserable confession
it was not strange that this half child half woman sometimes looked
towards that gray sea eternally waiting for herthat sea which had
taken everything from her and given her nothing in returnfor an
obliterating and perhaps exonerating death

The third day of her waiting isolation was broken upon by another
intrusion The morning had been threatening with an opaque motionless
livid arch above which had taken the place of the usual flying scud and
shaded cloud masses of the rainy season The whole outlying ocean too
beyond the bar appeared nearer and even seemed to be lifted higher
than the Bay itself and was lit every now and then with wonderful
clearness by long flashes of breaking foam like summer lightning She
knew that this meant a southwester and began with a certain mechanical
deliberation to set her little domain in order against the coming gale
She drove the cows to the rude shed among the scrub oaks she collected
the goats and young kids in the corral and replenished the stock of
fuel from the woodpile She was quite hidden in the shrubbery when she
saw a boat making slow headway against the wind towards the little cove
where but a moment before she had drawn up the dingey beyond the reach
of breaking seas It was a whaleboat from Saucelito containing a few
men As they neared the landing she recognized in the man who seemed to
be directing the boat the second friend of Colonel Marionthe man who
had come with the Secretary to take him off but whom she had never
seen again In her present horror of that memory she remained hidden
determined at all hazards to avoid a meeting When they had landed
one of the men halted accidentally before the shrubbery where she was
concealed as he caught his first view of the cottage which had been
invisible from the point they had rounded

Look here Bragg he said turning to Marions friend in a voice
which was distinctly audible to Mrs Bunker What are we to say to
these people

Theres only one returned the other The mans at sea His wifes
here Shes all right

You said she was one of us

After a fashion Shes the woman who helped Marion when he was here I
reckon he made it square with her from the beginning for she forwarded
letters from him since But you can tell her as much or as little as you
find necessary when you see her

Yes but we must settle that NOW said Bragg sharply and I propose
to tell her NOTHING Im against having any more petticoats mixed up
with our affairs I propose to make an examination of the place without
bothering our heads about her

But we must give some reason for coming here and we must ask her to
keep dark or well have her blabbing to the first person she meets
urged the other

Shes not likely to see anybody before night when the brig will be in
and the men and guns landed Move on and let Jim take soundings off
the cove while I look along the shore Its just as well that theres
a house here and a little cover like thispointing to the
shrubberyto keep the men from making too much of a show until after
the earthworks are up There are sharp eyes over at the Fort

There dont seem to be any one in the house now returned the other
after a moments scrutiny of the cottage or the woman would surely
come out at the barking of the dog even if she hadnt seen us Likely
shes gone to Saucelito

So much the better Just as well that she should know nothing until
it happens Afterwards well settle with the husband for the price of
possession he has only a squatters rights Come along well have
bad weather before we get back round the Point again but so much the
better for it will keep off any inquisitive longshore cruisers

They moved away But Mrs Bunker stung through her benumbed and
brooding consciousness and made desperate by this repeated revelation
of her former weakness had heard enough to make her feverish to hear
more She knew the intricacies of the shrubbery thoroughly She knew
every foot of shade and cover of the clearing and creeping like a cat
from bush to bush she managed without being discovered to keep
the party in sight and hearing all the time It required no great
discernment even for an inexperienced woman like herself at the end of
an hour to gather their real purpose It was to prepare for the secret
landing of an armed force disguised as laborers who under the outward
show of quarrying in the bluff were to throw up breastworks and
fortify the craggy shelf The landing was fixed for that night and was
to be effected by a vessel now cruising outside the Heads

She understood it all now She remembered Marions speech about the
importance of the bluff for military purposes she remembered the visit
of the officers from the Fort opposite The strangers were stealing a
march upon the Government and by night would be in possession It was
perhaps an evidence of her newly awakened and larger comprehension that
she took no thought of her loss of home and propertyperhaps there was
little to draw her to it nowbut was conscious only of a more terrible
catastrophea catastrophe to which she was partly accessory of
which any other woman would have warned her husbandor at least those
officers of the Fort whose business it was toAh yes the officers of
the Fortonly just opposite to her She trembled and yet flushed with
an inspiration It was not too late yetwhy not warn them NOW

But how A message sent by Saucelito and the steamboat to San
Franciscothe usual waywould not reach them tonight To go herself
rowing directly across in the dingey would be the only security of
success If she could do it It was a long pullthe sea was getting
upbut she would try

She waited until the last man had stepped into the boat in nervous
dread of some one remaining Then when the boat had vanished round
the Point again she ran back to the cottage arrayed herself in her
husbands pilot coat hat and boots and launched the dingey It was a
heavy slow but luckily a stanch and seaworthy boat It was not until
she was well off shore that she began to feel the full fury of the wind
and waves and knew the difficulty and danger of her undertaking She
had decided that her shortest and most direct course was within a few
points of the wind but the quartering of the waves on the broad bluff
bows of the boat tended to throw it to leeward a movement that while
it retarded her forward progress no doubt saved the little craft from
swamping Again the feebleness and shortness of her stroke which never
impelled her through a rising wave but rather lifted her half way up
its face prevented the boat from taking much water while her steadfast
gaze fixed only on the slowly retreating shore kept her steering free
from any fatal nervous vacillation which the sight of the threatening
seas on her bow might have produced Preserved through her very
weakness ignorance and simplicity of purpose the dingey had all
the security of a drifting boat yet retained a certain gentle but
persistent guidance In this feminine fashion she made enough headway
to carry her abreast of the Point where she met the reflux current
sweeping round it that carried her well along into the channel now
sluggish with the turn of the tide After half an hours pulling she
was delighted to find herself again in a reverse current abreast of her
cottage but steadily increasing her distance from it She was in fact
on the extreme outer edge of a vast whirlpool formed by the force of the
gale on a curving lee shore and was being carried to her destination in
a semicircle around that bay which she never could have crossed She was
moving now in a line with the shore and the Fort whose flagstaff above
its green square and white quarters she could see distinctly and
whose lower water battery and landing seemed to stretch out from the
rocks scarcely a mile ahead Protected by the shore from the fury of the
wind and even of the sea her progress was also steadily accelerated
by the velocity of the current mingling with the ebbing tide A sudden
fear seized her She turned the boats head towards the shore but it
was swept quickly round again she redoubled her exertions tugging
frantically at her helpless oars She only succeeded in getting the
boat into the trough of the sea where after a lurch that threatened to
capsize it it providentially swung around on its short keel and began
to drift stern on She was almost abreast of the battery now she could
hear the fitful notes of a bugle that seemed blown and scattered above
her head she even thought she could see some men in blue uniforms
moving along the little pier She was passing it another fruitless
effort to regain her ground but she was swept along steadily towards
the Gate the whitening bar and the open sea

She knew now what it all meant This was what she had come for this
was the end Beyond only a little beyond just a few moments longer to
wait and then out there among the breakers was the rest that she had
longed for but had not dared to seek It was not her fault they could
not blame HER He would come back and never know what had happenednor
even know how she had tried to atone for her deceit And he would find
his house in possession ofofthose devils No No she must not die
yet at least not until she had warned the Fort She seized the oars
again with frenzied strength the boat had stopped under the unwonted
strain staggered tried to rise in an uplifted sea took part of it
over her bow struck down Mrs Bunker under half a ton of blue water
that wrested the oars from her paralyzed hands like playthings swept
them over the gunwale and left her lying senseless in the bottom of the
boat

The sudden jarring and tilting of the waterlogged boat a sound of
rasping timbers the swarming of men in shirtsleeves and blue trousers
around her seemed to rouse her momentarily but she again fainted away

When she struggled back to consciousness once more she was wrapped in a
soldiers jacket her head pillowed on the shirtsleeve of an artillery
corporal in the stern sheets of that eightoared government barge
she had remembered But the only officer was a bareheaded boyish
lieutenant and the rowers were an athletic but unseamanlike crew of
mingled artillerymen and infantry

And where did ye drift from darlint

Mrs Bunker bridled feebly at the epithet

I didnt drift I was going to the Fort

The Fort is it

Yes I want to see the general

Wadnt the liftenant do ye Or shure theres the adjutant hes a foine
man

Silence Flanigan said the young officer sharply Then turning to
Mrs Bunker he said Dont mind HIM but let his wife take you to the
canteen when we get in and get you some dry clothes

But Mrs Bunker spurred to convalescence at the indignity protested
stiffly and demanded on her arrival to be led at once to the generals
quarters A few officers who had been attracted to the pier by the
rescue acceded to her demand

She recognized the grayhaired handsome man who had come ashore at her
house With a touch of indignation at her treatment she briefly told
her story But the general listened coldly and gravely with his eyes
fixed upon her face

You say you recognized in the leader of the party a man you had seen
before Under what circumstances

Mrs Bunker hesitated with burning cheeks He came to take Colonel
Marion from our place

When you were hiding himyes weve heard the story Now Mrs
Bunker may I ask you what you as a Southern sympathizer expect to
gain by telling me this story

But here Mrs Bunker burst out I am not a Southern sympathizer Never
Never Never Im a Union womanwife of a Northern man I helped that
man before I knew who he was Any Christian Northerner or Southerner
would have done the same

Her sincerity and passion were equally unmistakable The general rose
opened the door of the adjoining room said a few words to an orderly on
duty and returned What you are asking of me Mrs Bunker is almost
as extravagant and unprecedented as your story You must understand as
well as your husband that if I land a force on your property it will be
to TAKE POSSESSION of it in the name of the Government for Government
purposes

Yes yes said Mrs Bunker eagerly I know that I am willing Zephas
will be willing

And continued the general fixing his eyes on her face you will
also understand that I may be compelled to detain you here as a hostage
for the safety of my men

Oh no no please said Mrs Bunker springing up with an imploring
feminine gesture I am expecting my husband He may be coming back at
any moment I must be there to see him FIRST Please let me go back
sir with your men put me anywhere ashore between them and those men
that are coming Lock me up keep me a prisoner in my own home do
anything else if you think I am deceiving you but dont keep me here to
miss him when he comes

But you can see him later said the general

But I must see him FIRST said Mrs Bunker desperately I must see
him first forforHE KNOWS NOTHING OF THIS He knows nothing of my
helping Colonel Marion he knows nothing ofhow foolish I have been
andhe must not know it from others There It was out at last She
was sobbing now but her pride was gone She felt relieved and did not
even notice the presence of two or three other officers who had entered
the room exchanged a few hurried words with their superior and were
gazing at her in astonishment

The generals brow relaxed and he smiled Very well Mrs Bunker
it shall be as you like then You shall go and meet your husband with
Captain Jennings hereindicating one of the officerswho will take
charge of you and the party

And said Mrs Bunker looking imploringly through her wet but pretty
lashes at the officer he wont say anything to Zephas either

Not a syllable said Captain Jennings gravely But while the tug is
getting ready general hadnt Mrs Bunker better go to Mrs Flanigan

I think not said the general with a significant look at the officer
as he gallantly offered his arm to the astonished Mrs Bunker if she
will allow me the pleasure of taking her to my wife

There was an equally marked respect in the manner of the men and
officers as Mrs Bunker finally stepped on board the steam tug that was
to convey the party across the turbulent bay But she heeded it
not neither did she take any concern of the still furious gale the
difficult landing the preternatural activity of the band of sappers
who seemed to work magic with their picks and shovels the shelter tents
that arose swiftly around her the sheds and bush inclosures that were
evoked from the very ground beneath her feet the wonderful skill
order and discipline that in a few hours converted her straggling
dominion into a formal camp even to the sentinel who was already
calmly pacing the rocks by the landing as if he had being doing it for
years Only one thing thrilled herthe sudden outburst fluttering and
snapping of the national flag from her little flagstaff He would see
itand perhaps be pleased

And indeed it seemed as if the men had caught the infection of her
anxiety for when her strained eyes could no longer pierce the murky
twilight settling over the Gate one came running to her to say that the
lookout had just discovered through his glass a closereefed schooner
running in before the wind It was her husband and scarcely an hour
after night had shut in the schooner had rounded to off the Point
dropped her boat and sped away to anchorage And then Mrs Bunker
running bareheaded down the rocks breaking in upon the hurried
explanation of the officer of the guard threw herself upon her
husbands breast and sobbed and laughed as if her heart would break

Nor did she scarcely hear his hurried comment to the officer and
unconscious corroboration of her story how a brig had raced them from
the Gate was heading for the bar but suddenly sheered off and put
away to sea again as if from some signal from the headland Yesthe
bluff interrupted Captain Jennings bitterly I thought of that but
the old man said it was more diplomatic just now to PREVENT an attempt
than even to successfully resist it

But when they were alone again in their little cottage and Zephas
honest eyeswith no trace of evil knowledge or suspicion in their
homely neutral lightnesswere looking into hers with his usual
simple trustfulness Mrs Bunker trembled whimpered andI grieve
to saybasely funked her boasted confession But here the Deity which
protects feminine weakness intervened with the usual miracle As he
gazed at his wifes troubled face an apologetic cloud came over his
rugged but open brow and a smile of awkward deprecating embarrassment
suffused his eyes I declare to goodness Mollie but I must tell you
suthin although I guess I didnt kalkilate to say a word about it But
darn it all I cant keep it in No Lookin inter that innercent
face o yournpressing her flushing cheeks between his cool brown
handsand gazing inter them two truthful eyesthey blinked at this
moment with a divine modestyand thinkin of what youve just did for
your kentrylike them revolutionary women o 76I feel like a darned
swab of a traitor myself Well what I want ter tell you is this Ye
know or yeve heard me tell o that Mrs Fairfax as left her husband
for that fireeatin Marion and stuck to him through thick and thin
and stood watch and watch with him in this howlin Southern rumpus
theyre kickin up all along the coast as if she was a man herself
Well jes as I hauled up at the wharf at Frisco she comes aboard

Youre Cap Bunker she says

Thats me maam I says

Youre a Northern man and you go with your kind sez she but youre
a white man and thars no cur blood in you But you aint listenin
Mollie youre dead tired lasswith a commiserating look at her now
whitening faceand Ill haul in line and wait Well to cut it short
she wanted me to take her down the coast a bit to where she could
join Marion She said shed been shook by his friends followed by
spiesand blame my skin Mollie ef that proud woman didnt break down
and CRY like a baby Now Mollie what got ME in all this was that them
Chivalry folksez was always jawin about their Southern dames and
their Ladye fairs and always runnin that kind of bilge water outer
their scuppers whenever they careened over on a fair windwas jes the
kind to throw off on a woman when they didnt want her and I kinder
thought Id like HER to see the difference betwixt the latitude o
Charleston and Cape Cod So I told her I didnt want the jewelry and
dimons she offered me but if she would come down to the wharf after
dark Id smuggle her aboard and Id allow to the men that she was YOUR
AUNTIE ez I was givin a free passage to Lord dear think o me takin
the name o Mollie Bunkers aunt in vain for that sort o woman Think
o me continued Captain Bunker with a tentative chuckle sort o
pretendin to hand yor auntie to Kernel Marion forfor his lady love
I dont wonder yes half frighted and half laffin he added as his
wife uttered a hysterical cry it WAS awful But it worked and I got
her off and wots more I got her shipped to Mazatlan where shell join
Marion and the two are goin back to Virginy where I guess they wont
trouble Californy again Ye know now deary he went on speaking with
difficulty through Mrs Bunkers clinging arms and fast dripping tears
why I didnt heave to to say goodby But its all over nowIve
made a clean breast of it Mollieand dont you cry

But it was NOT all over For a moment later Captain Bunker began to
fumble in his waistcoat pocket with the one hand that was not clasping
his wifes waist One thing more Mollie when I left her and refused
to take any of her dimons she put a queer sort o ring into my hand
and told me with a kind o mischievious bedevilin smile that I
must keep it to remember her by Here it iswhy Mollie lass are you
crazy

She had snatched it from his fingers and was running swiftly from the
cottage out into the tempestuous night He followed closely until
she reached the edge of the rocks And only then in the struggling
fastflying moonlight she raised a passionate hand and threw it far
into the sea

As he led her back to the cottage she said she was jealous and honest
Captain Bunker with his arm around her felt himself the happiest man
in the world



From that day the flag flew regularly over the rocky shelf and in
time bugles and morning drumbeats were wafted from it to the decks of
passing ships For the Federal Government had adjudged the land for its
own use paid Captain Bunker a handsome sum for its possession and
had discreetly hidden the little cottage of Mrs Bunker and its history
forever behind bastion and casemate




THE TRANSFORMATION OF BUCKEYE CAMP


PART I


The tiny lights that had been far scattered and intermittent as
fireflies all along the dark stream at last dropped out one by one
leaving only the three windows of Parks Emporium to pierce the
profoundly wooded banks of the South Fork So allpervading was the
darkness that the mere opening of the Emporium front door shot out an
illuminating shaft which revealed the whole length of the little main
street of Buckeye while the simple passing of a single figure before
one of the windows momentarily eclipsed a third of the settlement This
undue preeminence given to the only three citizens of Buckeye who were
still up at ten o clock seemed to be hardly justified by their outward
appearance which was that of ordinary longbearded and longbooted
river bar miners Two sat upon the counter with their hands upon their
knees the third leaned beside the open window

It was very quiet The faint far barking of a dog or an occasional
subdued murmur from the river shallows audible only when the wind rose
slightly helped to intensify their solitude So supreme had it become
that when the man at the window at last continued his conversation
meditatively with his face towards it he seemed to be taking all
Nature into his confidence

The worst thing about it is that the only way we can keep her out of
the settlement is by the same illegal methods which we deplore in other
camps We have always boasted that Buckeye could get along without
Vigilance Committees or Regulators

Yes and that was because we started it on the principle of original
selection which we are only proposing to continue replied one of
the men on the counter So theres nothing wrong about our sending a
deputation to wait upon her to protest against her settling here and
give her our reasons

Yes only it has all the impudence without the pluck of the Regulators
You demand what you are afraid to enforce Come Parks you know she has
all the rights on her side Look at it squarely She proposes to open
a store and sell liquor and cigars which she serves herself in the
brokendown tienda which was regularly given to her people by the
Spanish grantee of the land were squatting on Its not her fault but
ours if weve adopted a line of rules which dont agree with hers to
govern the settlers on HER land nor should she be compelled to follow
them Nor because we justify OUR squatting here on the ground that the
Spanish grant isnt confirmed yet can we forbid her squatting under the
same right

But look at the moral question Brace Consider the example the
influence of such a shop kept by such a woman on the community We
have the right to protect ourselvesthe majority

Thats the way the lynchers talk returned Brace And Im not so sure
about there being any moral question yet You are assuming too much
There is no reason why she shouldnt run the tienda as decentlybarring
the liquor sale which however is legal and for which she can get a
licenseas a man could and without interfering with our morals

Then what is the use of our rules

They were made for those who consented to adopt them as we all did
They still bind US and if we dont choose to buy her liquor or cigars
that will dispose of her and her tienda much more effectually than your
protest Its a pity shes a lone unprotected woman Now if she only had
a husband

She carries a dagger in her garter

This apparently irrelevant remark came from the man who had not yet
spoken but who had been listening with the languid unconcern of one
who relinquishing the labor of argument to others had consented to
abide by their decision It was met with a scornful smile from each of
the disputants perhaps even by an added shrug of the shoulders from
the womans previous defender HE was evidently not to be taken in by
extraneous sentiment Nevertheless both listened as the speaker
slowly feeling his knees as if they were his way to a difficult subject
continued with the same suggestion of stating general fact but waiving
any argument himself Clarkson of Angels allows shes got a free
gaudy pictercovered style with the boys but that she can be
giltedged when she wants to Rowley Meadehim ez hed his skelp pulled
over his eyes at one stroke foolin with a she bear over on Black
Mountainallows it would be rather monotonous in him attemptin any
familiarities with her Bulstrodes brother ez was in Marysville said
there was a womanlike to her but not herez made it lively for the
boys with a game called Little Monte and he dropped a hundred dollars
there afore he came away They do say that about seven men got shot in
Marysville on account o this one or from some oneasiness that happened
at her shop But then he went on slowly and deferentially as the faces
of the two others were lowered and became fixed SHE says she tired o
drunken rowdiestheres a sameness about em and it dont sell her
pipes and cigars and thats WHY shes coming here Thompson over at Dry
Creek sez that THATS where our reputation is playin us Weve got her
as a reward o virtoo and be dd to us But cautiously Thompson
aint drawed a sober breath since Christmas

The three men looked in each others faces in silence The same thought
occurred to each the profane Thompson was right and the womans advent
was the logical sequence of their own ethics Two years previously
the Buckeye Company had found gold on the South Fork and had taken up
claims Composed mainly of careful provident and thoughtful mensome
of cultivation and refinementthey had adopted a certain orderly
discipline for their own guidance solely which however commended
itself to later settlers already weary of the lawlessness and reckless
freedom which usually attended the inception of mining settlements
Consequently the birth of Buckeye was accompanied with no dangerous
travail its infancy was free from the diseases of adolescent
communities The settlers without any express prohibition had tacitly
dispensed with gambling and drinking saloons following the unwritten
law of example had laid aside their revolvers and mingled together
peacefully when their labors were ended without a single peremptory
regulation against drinking and playing or carrying lethal weapons
Nor had there been any test of fitness or qualification for citizenship
through previous virtue There were one or two gamblers a skillful
duelist and men who still drank whiskey who had voluntarily sought the
camp Of some such antecedents was the last speaker Probably with two
wives elsewhere and a possible homicidal record he had modestly held
aloof from obtrusive argument

Well we must have a meeting and put the question squarely to the boys
tomorrow said Parks gazing thoughtfully from the window The remark
was followed by another long silence Beyond in the darkness Buckeye
unconscious of the momentous question awaiting its decision slept on
peacefully

I brought the keg of whiskey and brandy from Red Gulch today that
Doctor Duchesne spoke of he resumed presently You know he said we
ought to have some in common stock that he could always rely upon in
emergencies and for use after the tule fever I didnt agree with him
and told him how I had brought Sam Denver through an attack with quinine
and arrowroot but he laughed and wanted to know if wed resolved
that everybody should hereafter have the Denver constitution Thats
the trouble with those old army surgeonsthey never can get over the
heroics of their past Why he told Parson Jennings that hed rather
treat a man for jimjams than one that was dying for want of stimulants
However the liquor is here and one of the things we must settle
tomorrow is the question if it ought not to be issued only on Duchesnes
prescription When I made that point to him squarely he grinned again
and wanted to know if I calculated to put the same restriction on the
sale of patent medicines and drugs generally

N powder n shot contributed the indifferent man

Perhaps youd better take a look at the liquor Saunders said Parks
dismissing the ethical question YOU know more about it than we do It
ought to be the best

Saunders went behind the counter drew out two demijohns and possibly
from the force of habit selected THREE mugs from the crockery and
poured some whiskey into each before he could check himself

Perhaps we had better compare tastes said Brace blandly They all
sipped their liquor slowly and in silence The decision was favorable
Better try some with water to see how it mixes said Saunders
lazily filling the glasses with a practiced hand This required more
deliberation and they drew their chairs to the table and sat down A
slight relaxation stole over the thoughtful faces of Brace and Parks
a gentle perspiration came over the latters brow but the features and
expression of Saunders never changed The conversation took a broader
range politics and philosophy entered into it literature and poetry
were discussed by Parks and Brace Saunders still retaining the air of
a dispassionate observer ready to be convinced but abstaining from
argumentand occasionally replenishing the glasses There was felt to
be no inconsistency between their present attitude and their previous
conversation rather it proved to them that gentlemen could occasionally
indulge in a social glass together without frequenting a liquor saloon
This was stated with some degree of effusion by Parks and assented
to with singular enthusiasm by Brace Saunders nodding It was also
observed with great penetration by Brace that in having really
GOOD specially selected liquor like that the great danger of the
intoshikatn fxhe corrected himself with great deliberation the
intoxicating effectsof adulterated liquors sold in drinking saloons
was obviated Mr Brace thought also that the vitiated quality of the
close air of a crowded saloon had a great deal to do with itthe excess
of carbonhiche begged their pardoncarbonic acid gas undoubtedly
rendered people slupid and steepy But here from the open window
he walked dreamily to it and leaned out admiringly towards the dark
landscape that softly slumbered without one could drink in only health
and poetry

Wots that said Saunders looking up

I said health and poetry returned Brace with some dignity I
repeat

No I mean wots that noise Listen

They listened so breathlessly that the soft murmur of the river seemed
to flow in upon them But above it quite distinctly came the regular
muffled beat of horsehoofs in the thick dust and the occasional rattle
of wheels over rocky irregularities But still very far and faint
and fading like the noises in a dream Brace drew a long breath Parks
smiled and softly closed his eyes But Saunders remained listening

That was over OUR road near the turnpike he said musingly Thats
queer thar aint any of the boys away tonight and thats a wagon
Its some one comin here Hark to that There it is again

It was the same sound but more distinct and nearer and then was lost
again

Theyre dragging through the river sand thats just abreast o
Mallorys Stopped there I reckon No pushin on again Hear
em grinding along the gravel over Hamiltons trailins Stopped
aginthats before Somervilles shanty Whats gone o them now Maybe
theyve lost the trail and got onto Grays slide through the woods Its
no use lookin ye couldnt see anything in this nigger dark Hol on
If theyre comin through the woods yell hear em again jest off here
Yes by thunder here they are

This time the clatter and horsehoofs were before them at the very
door A mans voice cried Whoa and there was a sudden bound on the
veranda The door opened for an instant the entrance appeared to be
filled with a mass of dazzling white flounces and a figure which from
waist to crown was impenetrably wrapped and swathed in black lace
Somewhere beneath its folds a soft Spanish yet somewhat childish voice
cried Tente Hol on turned and vanished This was succeeded by the
apparition of a silent swarthy Mexican who dropped a small trunk at
their feet and vanished also Then the whiteflounced and blacklaced
figure reappeared as the departing wagon rattled away glided to
the centre of the room placed on the trunk a small foot whose
lowquartered black satin slipper seemed to be held only by the toe
threw back with both hands the black lace mantilla which was pinned by
a rose over her little right ear and with her hands slightly extended
and waving softly said Mira caballeros Ere we are again boys Viva
Aow ees your mother Aow ees that for high Behold me just from Pike

Parks and Brace who had partly risen fell back hopelessly in their
chairs again and gazed at the figure with a feeble smile of vacuous
pain and politeness At which it advanced lowered its black eyes
mischievously over the table and the men who sat there poured out a
glass of the liquor and said I look towards you boys Dont errise
You are just a leetle weary eh A leetle Oh yes a leetle tired of
crookin your elboweh Dont care if the school keepeh Dont want
any pie Want to go ome eh

But here Mr Parks rose with slight difficulty but unflinching dignity
and leaned impressively over the table May I ashkmay I be
permitted to arsk madam to what we may owe the pleasure of thishof
thisvisit

Her face and attitude instantly changed Her arms dropped and caught up
the mantilla with a quick but not ungraceful sweep and in apparently a
single movement she was draped wrapped and muffled from waist to crown
as before With a slight inclination of her head she said in quite
another voice Si senor I have arrive here because in your whole
great town of Booki there is not so much as oneshe held up a small
brown fingeras much as ONE leetle light or fire like thees because
in this grand pueblo there is not one peoples who have not already sleep
in his bed but thees Bueno I have arrive all the same like a leetle
bird like the small fly arrive to the light not to YOUonly to THE
LIGHT I go not to my casa for she is dark and tonight she have nothing

brown finger again upliftedotel in Booki I make the otelthe
Fondain my hoose mananatomorrow Tonight I and Sanchicha make the
bed for us ere Sanchicha she stands herself now over in the street
We have mooch sorrow we have to make the caballeros mooch trrouble to
make disposition of his house But what will you

There was another awkward silence and then Saunders who had been
examining the intruder with languid criticism removed his pipe from his
mouth and said quietly

Thats the woman youre looking forJovita Mendez


PART II


The rest of that interview has not been recorded Suffice it that a few
minutes later Parks Brace and Saunders left the Emporium and passed
the night in the latters cabin leaving the Emporium in possession
of Miss Mendez and her peon servant that at the earliest dawn the two
women and their baggage were transferred to the old adobe house where
however a Mexican workman had already arrived and with a basketful of
red tiles was making it habitable Buckeye which was popularly supposed
to sleep with one eye on the river and always first repaired there in
the morning to wash and work was only awake to the knowledge of the
invasion at noon The meeting so confidently spoken of the night
before had NOT been called Messrs Parks and Brace were suffering from
headachesundoubtedly a touch of tule chill Saunders at work with his
partner in Eagle Bar was as usual generous with apparently irrelevant
facts on all subjectsbut that of the strangers It would seem as if
the selfconstituted Committee of Safety had done nothing

And nothing whatever seemed to happen Thompson of Angels smoking a
meditative pipe at noon on the trail noticed the repairing of the old
adobe house casually spoke of it on his return to his work without
apparent concern or exciting any comment The two Billinger brothers saw
Jovita Mendez at the door of her house an hour later were themselves
seen conversing with her by Jim Barker but on returning to their claim
neither they nor Barker exhibited any insurrectionary excitement Later
on Shuttleworth was found in possession of two bundles of freshly
rolled cornhusk cigarettes and promised to get his partner some the
next day but that gentleman anticipated him By nightfall nearly
all Buckeye had passed in procession before the little house without
exhibiting any indignation or protest That night however it seemed as
if the events for which the Committee was waiting were really impending
The adult female population of Buckeye consisted of seven womenwives
of miners That they would submit tamely to the introduction of a young
pretty and presumably dangerous member of their own sex was not to
be supposed But whatever protest they made did not pass beyond their
conjugal seclusion and was apparently not supported by their husbands
Two or three of them under the pretext of sympathy of sex secured
interviews with the fair intruder the result of which was not however
generally known But a few days later Mrs Bob Carpentera somewhat
brickdusty blondewas observed wearing some black netting and a
heavily flounced skirt and Mrs Shuttleworth in her next visit to
Fiddletown wore her Paisley shawl affixed to her chestnut hair by a
bunch of dogroses and wrapped like a plaid around her waist The seven
ladies of Buckeye who had never before met except on domestic errands
to each others houses or on Sunday attendance at the First Methodist
Church at Fiddletown now took to walking together or in their
husbands company along the upper bank of the riverthe one boulevard
of Buckeye The third day after Miss Mendez arrival they felt the
necessity of immediate shopping expeditions to Fiddletown This
operation had hitherto been confined to certain periods and restricted
to the laying in of stores of rough household stuffs but it now
apparently included a wider range and more ostentatious quality Parks
Emporium no longer satisfied them and this unexpected phase of
the situation was practically brought home to the proprietor in the
necessity of extending the more inoffensive and peaceful part of his
stock And when towards the end of the week a cartload of pretty
fixtures mirrors and furniture arrived at the tienda there was
a renewed demand at the Emporium for articles not in stock and the
consequent diverting of custom to Fiddletown Buckeye found itself face
to face with a hitherto undreamt of and preposterous proposition It
seemed that the advent of the strange woman without having yet produced
any appreciable effect upon the men had already insidiously inveigled
the adult female population into ostentatious extravagance

At the end of a week the little adobe house was not only rendered
habitable but was even made picturesque by clean white curtains at
its barred windows and some bright halfMoorish coloring of beams and
rafters Nearly the whole ground floor was given up to the saloon of
the tienda which consisted of a small counter at one side containing
bottles and glasses and another flanking it with glass cases
containing cigars pipes and tobacco while the centre of the room was
given up to four or five small restaurant tables The staff of Jovita
was no longer limited to Sanchicha but had been augmented by a little
old man of indefinite antiquity who resembled an Aztec idol and an
equally old Mexican who looked not unlike a browntinted and veined
tobacco leaf himself and might have stood for a sign But the genius
of the place its omnipresent and allpervading goddess was Jovita
Smiling joyous indefatigable in suavity and attention allembracing
in her courtesies frank of speech and eye quick at repartee and
deftly handling the slang of the day and the locality with a childlike
appreciation and an infantine accent that seemed to redeem it from
vulgarity or unfeminine boldness Few could resist the volatile
infection of her presence A smile was the only tribute she exacted
and goodhumor the rule laid down for her guests If it occasionally
required some mental agility to respond to her banter a Californian
gathering was however seldom lacking in humor Yet she was always the
principal performer to an admiring audience Perhaps there was security
in this multitude of admirers perhaps there was a saving grace in this
humorous trifling The passions are apt to be serious and solitary and
Jovita evaded them with a jestwhich if not always delicate or witty
was effective in securing the laughter of the majority and the jealousy
of none

At the end of the week another peculiarity was noticed There was a
perceptible increase of the Mexican population who had always hitherto
avoided Buckeye On Sunday an Irish priest from El Pasto said mass in a
patchedup corner of the old Mission ruin opposite Rollinsons Ford A
few lounging Excelsior boys were equally astonished to see Jovitas
red rose crest and black mantilla glide by and followed her unvarying
smile and jesting salutation up to the shadow of the crumbling portal
At vespers nearly all Buckeye hitherto virtuously skeptical and
goodhumoredly secure in Works without Faith made a point of attending
it was alleged by some to see if Jovitas glossy Indianinky eyes would
suffer aberration in her devotions But the rosecrested head was never
lifted from the wellworn prayerbook or the brown hands which held
a certain poor little cheap rosary like a childs string of battered
copper coins Buckeye lounged by the wall through the service with
respectful tolerance and uneasy shifting legs and came away But the
apparently simple event did not end there It was unconsciously charged
with a tremendous import to the settlement For it was discovered the
next day by Mrs Bob Carpenter and Nan Shuttleworth that the Methodist
Church at Fiddletown was too far away and Buckeye ought to have a
preacher of its own Seats were fitted up in the loft of Carpenters
storehouse where the Reverend Henry McCorkle held divine service
and instituted a Bible class At the end of two weeks it appeared
that Jovitas invasionwhich was to bring dissipation and ruin to
Buckeyehad indirectly brought two churches A chilling doubt like a
cold mist settled along the river As the two rival processions passed
on the third Sunday Jo Bateman who had been in the habit of reclining
on that day in his shirtsleeves under a tree with a novel in his hand
looked gloomily after them Then knocking the ashes from his pipe he
rose shook hands with his partners said apologetically that he had
lately got into the habit of RESPECTING THE SABBATH and was too old
to change again and so shook the red dust of Buckeye from his feet and
departed

As yet there had not been the slightest evidence of disorderly conduct
on the part of the fair proprietress of the tienda nor her customers
nor any drunkenness or riotous disturbance that could be at all
attributed to her presence There was it is true considerable
hilarity smoking and some gambling there until a late hour but
this could not be said to interfere with the rest and comfort of other
people A clue to the mystery of so extraordinary a propriety was given
by Jovita herself One day she walked into Parks Emporium and demanded
an interview with the proprietor

You have made the rules for thees Booki

Yesthat isI and my friends have

And when one shall not have mind the rulewhen one have say No damn
the rule what shall you make to him Shall you aprison him

Mr Parks hastened to say with a superior yet engaging smile that it
never had been necessary as the rules were obligatory upon the honor
and consent of alland were never broken Except he added still
more engagingly she would remember in her casewith their consent

And your caballeros break not the rules

No

Then they shall not break the rules of meat MY TIENDA Look I have
made the rule that I shall not have a caballero drunk at my house I
have made the rule that I shall not sell him the aguardiente when he
have too mooch I have made the rule that when he gamble too mooch when
he put up too mooch money I say No I will not that he shall I make
one more rule that he shall not quarrel nor fight in my house When he
quarrel and fight I say Go Vamos Get out

And very good rules they are too Miss Mendez

Jovita fixed her shining black eyes on the smiling Parks And when he
say No nevarre damn the rules When he come drunk remain drunk
play high and fight YOU will not poonish him YOU will not take him
out

Well you see the fact is I have not the power

Are you not the Alcalde

No There is a Justice of the Peace at Fiddletown but even he could
do nothing to enforce your rules But if anything should happen you can
make a complaint to him

Bueno You have not the power I have I make not the complaint to
Fiddletown I make the complaint to Jose Perez to Manuel to Antonio
to Sanchichashe is a strong one I say Chook him out They chook him
out they remove him He does not rrremain Enough Bueno Gracias
senor goodaby

She was gone For the next four days Parks was in a state of some
anxietybut it appeared unnecessarily so Whether the interview had
become known along the river did not transpire but there seemed to be
no reason for Miss Mendez to enforce her rules It was said that once
when Thompson of Angels was a little too noisy he had been quietly
conducted by his friends from the tienda without the intervention of
Jose The frequenters of the saloon became its police

Yet the eventlong protractedcame at last It was a dry feverish
breezeless afternoon when the short echoless explosion of a revolver
puffed out on the river followed by another delivered so rapidly that
they seemed rolled into one There was no mistaking that significant
repetition ONE shot might have been an accident TWO meant intention
The men dropped their picks and shovels and ranran as they never
before ran in Buckeyeran mechanically blindly groping at their belts
and pockets for the weapons that hung there no longer ran aimlessly
as to purpose but following instinctively with hurried breath and
quivering nostrils the cruel scent of powder and blood Ran
until reaching the tienda the foremost stumbled over the body of
Shuttleworth came upon the halfsitting halfleaning figure of
Saunders against its adobe wall The doors were barred and closed and
even as the crowd charged furiously forward a window was sharply shut
above in their very face

Stand back gentlemen Lift him up Whats the row What is it
Saunders Who did it Speak man

But Saunders who was still supporting himself against the wall only
looked at them with a singular and halfapologetic smile and then
leaned forward as if to catch the eye of Shuttleworth who was
recovering consciousness in the uplifted arms of his companions But
neither spoke

Its some dd Greaser inside said Thompson with sudden ferocity
Some of her cursed crew Break down the doors boys

Stop

It was the voice of Shuttleworth speaking with an effort He was
hard hit somewhere in the groin pain and blood were coming with
consciousness and movement and his face was ghastly Yet there was
the same singular smile of embarrassment which Saunders had worn and a
touch of invincible disgust in his voice as he stammered quickly Dont
be dd fools Its no one in THERE Its only me and HIM Hell tell
you that Wont you Saunders

Yes said Saunders leaning anxiously forward with a brightening
face Dn it allcant you see Its onlyonly us

You and me thats all repeated Shuttleworth with a feverish laugh
Only our dd foolishness Think of it boys He gave me the lie and
I drew

Both of us full you knowreglar beasts said Saunders sinking back
against the wall Kick me somebody and finish me off

I dont see any weapons here said Brace gravely examining the
ground

Theyre inside said Shuttleworth with tremulous haste We began it
in therejust like hogs you know Didnt we Saunders bitterly

You bet said Saunders faintly Reglar swine

Parks looked graver still and as he passed a handkerchief around the
wounded mans thigh said But I dont see where you got your pistols
and how you got out here

Clinched you know sorter rolled over out hereandandoh dn
itdont talk

He means said Shuttleworth still feebly that wewegrabbed
ANOTHER MANS sixshooter andandhe that isand theyhehe and
me grabbed each other anddont you see but here becoming more
involved and much weaker he discreetly fainted away

And that was all Buckeye ever knew of the affair For they refused
to speak of it again and Dr Duchesne gravely forbade any further
interrogation Both mens revolvers were found undischarged in their
holsters hanging in their respective cabins The balls which were
afterwards extracted from the two men singularly disappeared Dr
Duchesne asserting with a grim smile that they had swallowed them

  It was a frontier superstition that the ball extracted
 from a gunshot wound if swallowed by the wounded man
 prevented inflammation or any supervening complications

Nothing could be ascertained of the facts at the tienda which at
that hour of the day appeared to have been empty of customers and was
occupied only by Miss Mendez and her retainers All surmises as to the
real cause of the quarrel and the reason for the reticence of the two
belligerents were suddenly and unexpectedly stopped by their departure
from Buckeye as soon as their condition permitted on the alleged
opinion of Dr Duchesne that the air of the river was dangerous to their
convalescence The momentary indignation against the tienda which the
two combatants had checked eventually subsided altogether After all
the fight had taken place OUTSIDE it was not even proven that
the provocation had been given AT the tienda Its popularity was
undiminished


PART III


It was the end of the rainy season and a wet night Brace and Parks
were looking from the window over the swollen river with faces quite as
troubled as the stream below Nor was the prospect any longer the same
In the past two years Buckeye had grown into a city They could now
count a half dozen church spires from the window of the threestoried
brick building which had taken the place of the old wooden Emporium but
they could also count the brilliantly lit windows of an equal number of
saloons and gamblinghouses which glittered through the rain or to
use the words of a local critic Shone seven nights in the week to the
Gospel shops ONE A difficulty had arisen which the two men had never
dreamed of and a struggle had taken place between the two rival powers
which was developing a degree of virulence and intolerance on both sides
that boded no good to Buckeye The disease which its infancy had escaped
had attacked its adult growth with greater violence The new American
saloons which competed with Jovita Mendez Spanish venture had
substituted a brutal masculine sincerity for her veiled feminine
methods There was higher play deeper drinking darker passion Yet the
opposition after the fashion of most reformers were casting back to
the origin of the trouble in Jovita and were confounding principles
and growth If it had not been for her the rule would never have been
broken If there was to be a cleaning out of the gambling houses she
must go first

The sounds of a harp and a violin played in the nearest saloon struggled
up to them with the opening and shutting of its swinging baize inner
doors There was boisterous chanting from certain belated revelers in
the next street which had no such remission The brawling of the stream
below seemed to be echoed in the uneasy streets the quiet of the old
days had departed with the sedate encompassing woods that no longer
fringed the river bank the restful calm of Nature had receded before
the dusty outskirts of the town

Its mighty unfortunate too said Brace moodily that Shuttleworth
and Saunders who havent been in the place since their row have come
over from Fiddletown today and are banging around town They havent
said anything that I know of but their PRESENCE is quite enough to
revive the old feeling against her shop The Committee he added
bitterly will be sure to say that not only the first gambling but the
first shooting in Buckeye took place there If they get up that story
againno matter how quiet SHE has become sinceno matter what YOU may
say as mayorit will go hard with her Whats that now

They listened breathlessly Above the brawling of the river the
twanging of the harpplayer and the receding shouts of the revelers
they could hear the hollow wooden sidewalks resounding with the dull
monotonous trampling of closely following feet Parks rose with a white
face

Brace

Yes

Will you stand by meand HER

Stand by YOU AND HER Eh What Good God Parksyou dont mean to say
youits gone as far as THAT

Will you or wont you

The sound of the trampling had changed to a shuffling on the pavement
below and then footsteps began to ascend the stairs

Brace held out his hand quickly and grasped that of Parks as the door
opened to half a dozen men They were evidently the ringleaders of
the crowd below There was no hesitation or doubt in their manner
the unswerving directness which always characterized those illegal
demonstrations lent it something of dignity Nevertheless Carpenter
the spokesman flushed slightly before Parks white determined face

Come Parks you know what were after he said bluntly We didnt
come here to parley We knew YOUR sentiments and what YOU think is your
duty We know what we consider OURSand so do you But were here to
give you a chance either as mayor or if you prefer it as the oldest
citizen here to take a hand in our business tonight Were not ashamed
of what were going to do and were willing to abide by it so theres
no reason why we shouldnt speak aboveboard of it to you We even invite
you to take part in our last call tonight at the Hall

Go whispered Brace quickly YOULL GAIN TIME

Parks face changed and he turned to Carpenter Enough he said
gravely I reserve what I have to say of these proceedings till I
join you there He stopped whispered a few words to Brace and then
disappeared as the men descended the stairs and joining the crowd
on the pavement proceeded silently towards the Town Hall There was
nothing in the appearance of that decorous procession to indicate its
unlawful character or the recklessness with which it was charged

There were thirty or forty men already seated in the Hall The meeting
was brief and to the point The gambling saloons were to be cleaned
out that night the tables and appliances thrown into the street and
burnt the doors closed and the gamblers were to be conducted to the
outskirts of the town and forbidden to enter it again on pain of death

Does this yer refer to Jovita Mendez saloon asked a voice

To their surprise the voice was not Parks but Shuttleworths It was
also a matter to be noted that he stood a little forward of the crowd
and that there was a corresponding movement of a dozen or more men from
Fiddletown who apparently were part of the meeting

The chairman No 10 said there was to be no exception and certainly
not for the originator of disorder in Buckeye He was surprised that the
question should be asked by No 72 who was an old resident of Buckeye
and who with No 73 had suffered from the character of that womans
saloon

Thats jest it said Shuttleworth and ez I reckon that SAUNDERS AND
ME did all the disorder there was and had to turn ourselves out o
town on account of it I dont see jest where SHE could come into this
affair Only he turned and looked around him in one way And that
way gentlemen would be for her to come here and boot one half o this
kempany out o town and shoot the other half You hear methats so
He stopped tugged a moment at his cravat and loosened his shirtcollar
as if it impeded his utterance and went on Ive got to say suthin
to you gentlemen about me and Saunders and this woman Ive got to
say suthin thats hard for a white man to say and him a married man
tooIve got to say that me and Saunders never had no QUOLL never had
NO FIGHT at her shop Ive got to say that me and Saunders got shot by
Jovita Mendez for INSULTIN HERfor tryin to treat her as if she was
the common dirt of the turnpikeand served us right Ive got to say
that Saunders and me made a bet that for all her airs she wasnt no
better than she might be and we went there drunk to try herand that
we got left with two shots into us like hounds as we were Thats
sowasnt it Saunders

With two shots inter us like hounds ez we were repeated Saunders with
deliberate precision

And Ive got to say suthin more genlemen continued Shuttleworth
now entirely removing his coat and vest and apparently shaking himself
free from any extraneous trammels Ive got to say thisIve got to
say that thar aint a man in Buckeye from Dirty Dick over yon to the
mayor of this town ez hasnt tried the same thing on and got leftgot
left without shootin maybe mores the pity but got left all the
same And Ive got to say lifting his voice THAT EF THATS WHAT YOU
CALL DISORDERLINESS IN HERif thats what yor turnin this woman out
o town forwhy

He stopped absolutely breathless and gasping For there was a momentary
shock of surprise and shame and then he was overborne by peal after
peal of inextinguishable laughter But it was the laughter that
precipitated doubt enlightened justice cleared confusion andsaved
them

In vain a few struggled to remind them that the question of the OTHER
saloons was still unaffected It was lost in the motion enthusiastically
put and carried that the Committee should instantly accompany Saunders
and Shuttleworth to Jovitas saloon to make an apology in their
presence Five minutes later they halted hilariously before its door
But it was closed dark and silent

Their sudden onset and alarm brought Sanchicha to the halfopened door
Ah yes the Senorita Bueno She had just left for Fiddletown with
the Senor Parks the honorable mayor They had been married only a few
moments before by the Reverend Mr McCorkle




THEIR UNCLE FROM CALIFORNIA


PART I


It was bitterly cold When night fell over Lakeville Wisconsin the
sunset which had flickered rather than glowed in the western sky took
upon itself a still more boreal tremulousness until at last it seemed
to fade away in cold blue shivers to the zenith Nothing else stirred
in the crisp still air the evening smoke of chimneys rose threadlike
and vanished The stars were early pale and pitiless when the later
moonlight fell it appeared only to whiten the stiffened earth like
snow except where it made a dull pewterlike film over the three
frozen lakes which encompassed the town

The site of the town itself was rarely beautiful and its pioneers
and founders had carried out the suggestions they had found there with
loving taste and intelligence

Themselves old voyageurs trappers and traders they still loved Nature
too well to exclude her from the restful homes they had achieved after
years of toiling face to face with her So a strip of primeval forest on
the one side and rolling level prairie on the other still came up to
the base of the hill whereon they had built certain solid houses which
a second generation had beautified and improved with modern taste
but which still retained their old honesty of foundation and wholesome
rustic space These yet stood among the old trees military squares
and broad sloping avenues of the town Seen from the railway by day the
regularity of streets and blocks was hidden by environing trees there
remained only a picturesque lifting of rustic gardens brown roofs
gables spires and cupolas above the mirroring lake seen from the
railway this bitter night the invisible terraces and streets were now
pricked out by symmetrical lines and curves of sparkling lights which
glittered through the leafless boughs and seemed to encircle the hill
like a diadem

Central in the chiefest square and yet preserving its old lordly
isolation in a wooded garden the homestead of Enoch Lane stood with all
its modern additions and improvements Already these included not only
the latest phases of decoration but various treasures brought by the
second generation from Europe which they were wont to visit but from
which they always contentedly returned to their little provincial town
Whether there was some instinctive yearning like the stirred sap of
great forests in their wholesome pioneer blood or whether there was
some occult fascination in the pretty towncrested hill itself it was
still certain that the richest inhabitants always preferred to live in
Lakeville Even the young who left it to seek their fortune elsewhere
came back to enjoy their success under the sylvan vaults of this vast
ancestral roof And that was why this 22d of December 1870 the whole
household of Gabriel Lane was awaiting the arrival from California of
his brother Sylvester Lane at the old homestead which he had left
twenty years ago

And you dont know how he looks said Kitty Lane to her father

I do perfectly rather chubby with blue eyes curly hair fair skin
and blushes when you speak to him

Papa

EhOh well he USED to You see that was twentyfive years ago when
he left here for boardingschool He ran away from there as I told you
went to sea and finally brought up at San Francisco

And you havent had any picture or photograph of him since

Nothat isI sayyou havent any of you got a picture of
Sylvester have you he turned in a vague parenthetical appeal to the
company of relatives and friends collected in the drawingroom after
dinner

Cousin Jane has she knows all about him

But it appeared that Cousin Jane had only heard Susan Marckland say
that Edward Bingham had told her that he was in California when
Uncle Sylvester had been nearly hanged by a Vigilance Committee for
protecting a horse thief or a gambler or some such person This was
felt to be ineffective as a personal description

Hes sure to wear a big beard they all do when they first come back
said Amos Gunn with metropolitan oraculousness

He has a big curling mustache long silken hair and broad shoulders
said Marie du Page

There was such piquant conviction in the manner of the speaker who was
also a very pretty girl that they all turned towards her and Kitty
quickly said

But YOUVE never seen him

Nobut She stopped and lifting one shoulder threw her spirited
head sideways in a pretty deprecatory way with elevated eyebrows and
an expression intended to show the otherwise untranslatable character of
her impression But it showed quite as pleasantly the other fact that
she was the daughter of a foreigner an old French military explorer
and that she had retained even in AngloSaxon Lakeville some of the
Gallic animation

Well how many of you girls are going with me to meet him at the
station said Gabriel dismissing with masculine promptness the lesser
question Its time to be off

Id like to go said Kitty and so would Cousin Jane but really
papa you see if YOU dont know him and WE dont either and youve got
to satisfy yourself that its the right man and then introduce YOURSELF
and then usand all this on the platform before everybodyit makes it
rather embarrassing for us And then as hes your younger brother and
were supposed to be his affectionate nieces you know it would make
HIM feel SO ridiculous

And if he were to KISS you said Marie tragically and then turn out
not to be him

So continued Kitty youd better take Cousin John who was more in
Uncle Sylvesters time to represent the Past of the family and perhaps
Mr Gunn

To represent the future I suppose interrupted Gabriel in a wicked
whisper

To represent a name that most men of the world in New York and
San Francisco know went on Kitty without a blush It would make
recognition and introduction easier And take an extra fur with you
dearnot for HIM but for yourself I suppose hes lived so much in the
open air as to laugh at our coddling

I dont know about that said her father thoughtfully the last
telegram I have from him en route says hes half frozen and wants a
close carriage sent to the station

Of course said Marie impatiently you forget the poor creature comes
from burning canyons and hot golden sands and perpetual sunshine

Very well but come along Marie and see how Ive prepared his room
and as her father left the drawingroom Kitty carried off her old
schoolfellow upstairs

The room selected for the coming Sylvester had been one of the elaborate
guestchambers but was now stripped of its more luxurious furniture and
arranged with picturesque yet rural extravagance A few rare buffalo
bear and panther skins were disposed over the bare floor and even
displayed gracefully over some elaborately rustic chairs The
handsome French bedstead had been displaced for a small wroughtiron
asceticlooking couch covered with a gorgeously striped Mexican blanket
The fireplace had been dismantled of its steel grate and the hearth
extended so as to allow a pile of symmetrically heaped mosscovered
hickory logs to take its place The walls were covered with trophies
of the chase buckhorns and deerheads and a number of Indian arrows
stood in a sheaf in the corners beside a few modern guns and rifles

Perfectly lovely said Marie butwith a slight shiver of her
expressive shouldersa little cold and outdoorish eh

Nonsense returned Kitty dictatorially and if he IS cold he can
easily light those logs They always build their open fires under a
tree Why even Mr Gunn used to do that when he was camping out in
the Adirondacks last summer I call it perfectly comfortable and SO
natural Nevertheless they had both tucked their chilly hands under
the fleecy shawls they had snatched from the hall for this hyperborean
expedition

You have taken much pains for him Kaitee said Marie with her
faintest foreign intonation You will like this strange uncleyou

He is a wonderful man Marie hes been everywhere seen everything
and done everything out there Hes fought duels been captured by
Indians and tied to a stake to be tortured Hes been leader of a
Vigilance Committee and they say that he has often shot and killed men
himself Im afraid hes been rather wicked you know Hes lived alone
in the woods like a hermit without seeing a soul and then again hes
been a chief among the Indians with Heaven knows how many Indian wives
They called him The Palefaced Thunderbolt my dear and The Young
Man who Swallows the Lightning or something like that

And what can he want here asked Marie

To see us my dear said Kitty loftily and then too he has to
settle something about HIS share of the property for you know grandpa
left a share of it to him Not that hes ever bothered himself about it
for hes richa kind of Monte Cristo you knowwith a gold mine and
an island off the coast to say nothing of a whole county that he owns
that is called after him and millions of wild cattle that he rides
among and lassos Its dreadfully hard to do You know you take a long
rope with a slipknot and you throw it around your head so and

Hark said Marie with a dramatic start and her finger on her small
mouth he comes

There was the clear roll of wheels along the smooth frozen carriage
sweep towards the house the sharp crisp click of hoofs on stone the
opening of heavy doors the sudden sparkling invasion of frigid air the
uplifting of voices in greetingbut all familiar There were Gabriel
Lanes cheery hopeful tones the soprano of Cousin Jane and Cousin
Emma the baritone of Mr Gunn and the grave measured oratorical
utterance of Parson Dexter who had joined the party at the station but
certainly the accents of no STRANGER Had he come Yes for his name
was just then called and the quick ear of Marie had detected a light
lounging alien footstep cross the cold strip of marble vestibule The
two girls exchanged a rapid glance each looked into the mirror and
then interrogatively at the other nodded their heads affirmatively and
descended to the drawingroom A group had already drawn round the fire
and a small central figure who with its back turned towards them
was still enwrapped in an enormous overcoat of rich fur was engaged in
presenting an alternate small varnished leather boot to the warmth of
the grate As they entered the room the heavy fur was yielded up with
apparent reluctance and revealed to the astonished girls a man of
ordinary stature with a slight and elegant figure set off by a traveling
suit of irreproachable cut His light reddishyellow hair mustache
and sunburned cheek which seemed all of one color and outline made it
impossible to detect the gray of the one or the hollowness of the other
and gave no indication of his age Yet there was clearly no mistake
Here was Gabriel Lane seizing their nervously cold fingers and
presenting them to their Uncle Sylvester

Far from attempting to kiss Kitty the stranger for an instant seemed
oblivious of the little hand she offered him in the halfpreoccupied
bow he gave her But Marie was not so easily passed over and with her
audacious face challenging his he abstractedly imparted to the shake of
her hand something of the fervor that he should have shown his relative
And then still warming his feet on the fender he seemed to have
forgotten them both

Accustomed as you have been sir said the Reverend Mr Dexter
seizing upon an awkward silence and accenting it laboriously perhaps
I should say INURED as you have been to the exciting and stirring
incidents of a lawless and adventurous community you doubtless find
in a pastoral yet cultivated and refined seclusion like Lakeville a
degree of

Oh several degrees said Uncle Sylvester blandly flicking bits
of buffalo hair from his wellfitting trousers its colder you
knowmuch colder

I was referring to a less material contrast continued Mr Dexter
with a resigned smile yet as to the mere question of cold I am
told sir that in California there are certain severe regions of
altitudealthough the mean temperature

I suppose out in California you fellows would say our temperature was a
darned sight MEANER eh broke in Amos Gunn with a confidential
glance at the others as if offering a humorous diversion suited to
the Californian taste Uncle Sylvester did not however smile Gazing
critically at Gunn he said thoughtfully I think not Ive even known
men killed for saying less than that and turned to the clergyman You
are quite right some of the higher passes are very cold I was lost in
one of them in 56 with a small party We were seventy miles from
any settlement we had had nothing to eat for thirtysix hours our
campfire melting the snow sank twelve feet below the surface The
circle closed eagerly around him Marie Kitty and Cousin Jane pressing
forward with excited faces even the clergyman assumed an expression of
profound interest A man by the name of Thompson I think continued
Uncle Sylvester thoughtfully gazing at the fire was frozen a few
yards away Towards morning having been fiftyeight hours without
food our last drop of whiskey exhausted and the fire extinguished we
found

Yes yes said half a dozen voices

We found continued Uncle Sylvester rubbing his hands cheerfully we
found itexceedingly cold YesEXCEEDINGLY cold

There was a dead silence

But you escaped said Kitty breathlessly

I think so I think we all escapedthat is except Thompson if
his name WAS Thompson it might have been Parker continued Uncle
Sylvester gazing with a certain languid astonishment on the eager faces
around him

But HOW did you escape

Oh somehow I dont remember exactly I dont think he went on
reflectively that we had to eat Thompsonif it was HIMat least not
then Nowith a faint effort of recollectionthat would have been
another affair Yes assuringly to the eager frightened eyes of Cousin
Jane you are quite right that was something altogether different
Dear me one quite mixes up these things Eh

A servant had entered and after a hurried colloquy with Gabriel the
latter turned to Uncle Sylvester

Excuse me but I think there must be some mistake We brought up your
luggage with youtwo trunksin the station wagon A man has just
arrived with three more which he says are yours

There should be five in all I think said Uncle Sylvester
thoughtfully

Maybe there are sir I didnt count exactly said the servant

All right said Uncle Sylvester cheerfully turning to his brother
You can put them in my room or on the landing except two marked L in
a triangle They contain some things I picked up for you and the girls
Well look them over in the morning And if you dont mind Ill excuse
myself now and go to bed

But its only half past ten said Gabriel remonstratingly You dont
surely go to bed at half past ten

I do when I travel Travel is SO exhausting Goodnight Dont let
anybody disturb themselves to come with me

He bowed languidly to the company and disappeared with a yawn
gracefully disguised into a parting smile

Well said Cousin Jane drawing a long breath

I dont believe its your Uncle Sylvester at all said Marie
vivaciously Its some trick that Gabriel is playing upon us And hes
not even a good actorhe forgets his part

And then five trunks for one single man Heavens what can he have in
them said Cousin Emma

Perhaps his confederates to spring out upon us at night after
everybodys asleep

Are you sure you remembered him papa said Kitty sotto voce

Certainly And my dear child he knows all the family history as well
as you do andcontinued her father with a slight laugh that did not
however conceal a certain seriousness that was new to himI only wish
I understood as much about the property as he does By the way Amos
he broke off suddenly turning to the young man he seemed to know your
people

Most men in the financial world do said Gunn a little superciliously

Yes but he asked me if you hadnt a relative of some kind in Southern
California or Mexico

A slight flushso slight that only the keen vivaciously observant eyes
of Marie noticed itpassed over the young mans face

I believe it is a known fact that our branch of the family never
emigrated from their native town he said emphatically The Gunns were
rather peculiar and particular in that respect

Then there were no offshoots from the old STOCK said Gabriel

Nevertheless this pet joke of Gabriels did not dissipate the
constraint and disappointment left upon the company by Uncle Sylvesters
unsatisfying performance and early withdrawal and they separated soon
after Kitty and Marie being glad to escape upstairs together On the
landing they met two of the Irish housemaids in a state of agitated
exhaustion It appeared that the sthrange gintleman had requested that
his bed be remade from bedclothes and bedding ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM
IN HIS TRUNKS From their apologetic tone it was evident that he had
liberally rewarded them Shure Miss protested Norah in deprecation
of Kittys flashing eye theres thim thats lived among shnakes and
poysin riptiles and faverous disayses thats particklar av the beds
and sheets they lie on Hisht Howly Mother its something else hes
wanting now

The door of Uncle Sylvesters room had slowly opened and a blue
pyjamad sleeve appeared carefully depositing the sheaf of bows and
arrows outside the door I say Norah or Bridget there some of
you take those infernal things away And look out will you for the
arrowheads are deadly poison The fool who got em didnt know they were
African and not Indian at all And hold on The hand vanished and
presently reappeared holding two rifles And take these away too
Theyre loaded capped and NOT on the halfcock A jar a fall the
slightest shock is enough to send them off

Im dreadfully sorry that you should find it so uncomfortable in our
house Uncle Sylvester said Kitty with a flushed cheek and vibrating
voice

Oh its youis it said Uncle Sylvesters voice cheerfully
I thought it was Bridget out there No I dont intend to find it
uncomfortable Thats why Im putting these things outside But for
Heavens sake dont YOU touch them Leave that to the ineffable ass who
put them there Goodnight

The door closed the whispering voices of the girls faded from the
corridor the lights were lowered in the central hall only the red
Cyclopean eye of an enormous columnar stove like a lighthouse gleamed
through the darkness Outside the silent night sparkled glistened and
finally paled Towards morning having invested the sturdy wooden outer
walls of the house and filmed with delicate tracery every available
inch of window pane it seemed stealthily to invade the house itself
stilling and chilling it as it drew closer around its central heart
of warmth and life Only once the frigid stillness was broken by the
opening of a door and steps along the corridor This was preceded by an
acrid smell of burning bark

It was subtle enough to permeate the upper floor and the bedroom of
Marie du Page who was that night a light and nervous sleeper Peering
from her door she could see on the lower corridor the extraordinary
spectacle of Uncle Sylvester robed in a gorgeous Japanese dressinggown
of quilted satin trimmed with the fur of the blue fox candle in hand
leisurely examining the wall of the passage Presently drawing out a
footrule from his pocket he actually began to measure it Miss Du
Page saw no more Hurriedly closing her door she locked and bolted it
firmly convinced that Gabriel Lane was harboring in the guise of Uncle
Sylvester a somnambulist a maniac or an impostor


PART II


It doesnt seem as if Uncle Sylvester was any the more comfortable
for having his own private bedding with him said Kitty Lane entering
Maries room early the next morning Bridget found him curled up in his
furs like a cat asleep on the drawingroom sofa this morning

Marie started she remembered her last nights vision But some
instinctshe knew not whatkept her from revealing it at this moment
She only said a little ironically

Perhaps he missed the wild freedom of his barbaric life in a small
bedroom

No Bridget says he said something about being smoked out of his room
by a ridiculous wood fire The idea As if a man brought up in the woods
couldnt stand a little smoke Nothats his excuse Mariedo you
know what I firmly believe

No said Marie quickly

I firmly believe that poor man is ashamed of his past rough life
and does everything he can to forget it Thats why he affects those
ultracivilized and effeminate ways and goes to the other extreme as
people always do

Then you think hes really reformed and isnt likely to take an
impulse to rob and murder anybody again

Why Marie what nonsense

Nevertheless Uncle Sylvester appeared quite fresh and cheerful at
breakfast It seemed that he had lit the fire before undressing but
the green logs were piled so far into the room that the smoke nearly
suffocated him Fearful of alarming the house by letting the smoke
escape through the door he opened the window and when it had partly
dispersed sought refuge himself from the arctic air of his bedroom
in the drawingroom So far the act did not seem inconsistent with his
sanity or even intelligence and consideration for others But Marie
fixed upon him a pair of black audacious eyes

Did you ever walk in your sleep Mr Lane

No butthoughtfully breaking an eggI have ridden I think

In your sleep Oh do tell us all about it said Cousins Jane and Emma
in chorus

Uncle Sylvester cast a resigned glance out of the window Oh
yescertainly it isnt much You see at one time I was in the habit of
making long monotonous journeys and they were often exhausting and
he added becoming wearied as if at the recollection always dreadfully
tiresome As the trail was sometimes very uncertain and dangerous I
rode a very surefooted mule that could go anywhere where there was space
big enough to set her small hoofs upon One night I was coming down the
slope of a mountain towards a narrow valley and river that were crossed
by an old abandoned flume of which nothing was now left but the
upright trestlework and long horizontal stringpiece As the trail was
very difficult and the mules pace was slow I found myself dozing at
times and at last I must have fallen asleep I think I must have been
awakened by a singular regularity in the movement of the muleor else
it was the monotony of step that had put me to sleep and the cessation
of it awakened me You see at first I was not certain that I wasnt
really dreaming For the trail seemed to have disappeared the wall of
rock on one side had vanished also and there appeared to be nothing
ahead of me but the opposite hillside

Uncle Sylvester stopped to look out of the window at a passing carriage
Then he went on The moon came out and I saw what had happened The
mule either of her own free will or obeying some movement I had given
the reins in my sleep had swerved from the trail got on top of
the flume and was actually walking across the valley on the narrow
stringpiece a foot wide half a mile long and sixty feet from the
ground I knew he continued examining his napkin thoughtfully that
she was perfectly surefooted and that if I kept quiet she could make
the passage but I suddenly remembered that midway there was a break and
gap of twenty feet in the continuous line and that the stringpiece was
too narrow to allow her to turn round and retrace her steps

Good heavens said Cousin Jane

I beg your pardon said Uncle Sylvester politely

I only said Good heavens Well she added impatiently

Well repeated Uncle Sylvester vaguely Oh thats all I only wanted
to explain what I meant by saying I had ridden in my sleep

But said Cousin Jane leaning across the table with grim
deliberation and emphasizing each word with the handle of her knife
howdidyouandthatmule get down

Oh with slings and ropes you knowso demonstrating by placing his
napkinring in a sling made of his napkin

And I suppose you carried the slings and ropes with you in your five
trunks gasped Cousin Jane

No Fellows on the river brought em in the morning Mighty spry chaps
those river miners

Very said Cousin Jane

Breakfast over they were not surprised that their sybaritic guest
excused himself from an inspection of the town in the frigid morning
air and declined joining a skating party to the lake on the ground that
he could keep warmer indoors with half the exertion An hour later found
him standing before the fire in Gabriel Lanes study looking languidly
down on his elder brother

Then as far as I can see he said quietly you have made ducks and
drakes of your share of the property and that virtually you are in the
hands of this man Gunn and his father

Youre putting it too strongly said Gabriel deprecatingly In the
first place my investments with Gunns firm are by no means failures
and they only hold as security a mortgage on the forest land below the
hill Its scarcely worth the money I would have sold it long ago but
it had been a fancy of fathers to keep it wild land for the sake of old
times and the healthiness of the town

There used to be a log cabin there where the old man had a habit of
camping out whenever he felt cramped by civilization up here wasnt
there said Uncle Sylvester meditatively

Yes said Gabriel impatiently its still therebut to return to Mr
Gunn He has taken a fancy to Kitty and even if I could not lift the
mortgage theres some possibility that the land would still remain in
the family

I think Ill drive over this afternoon and take a look at the old
shanty if this infernal weather lets up

Yes but just now my dear Sylvester let us attend to business I want
to show you those investments

Oh certainly trot em out said his brother plucking up a
simulation of interest as he took a seat at the table

From a drawer of his desk Gabriel brought out a bundle of prospectuses
and laid them before Uncle Sylvester

A languid smile of recognition lit up the latters face Ah yes he
said glancing at them The old lot Carmelita Santa Maria and
Preciosa Just as I imaginedand yet whod have thought of seeing
them HERE A good deal rouged and powdered Miss Carmelita since I
first knew you Considerably bolstered up by miraculous testimony to
your powers my dear Santa Maria since the day I found you out to my
cost And you too Preciosaa precious lot of money I dropped on you
in the old days

You are joking said Gabriel with an uneasy smile You dont mean to
imply that this stock is old and worthless

There isnt a capital in America or Europe where for the last five
years it hasnt been floated with a new character each time My dear
Gabriel that stock isnt worth the paper it is printed on

But it is impossible that an experienced financier like Gunn could be
deceived

Im sorry to hear THAT

Come Sylvester confess youve taken a prejudice against Gunn from
your sudden dislike of his son And what have you against him

I couldnt say exactly said Uncle Sylvester reflectively It may be
his eyes or only his cravat But rising cheerfully and placing his
hand lightly on his brothers shoulder dont YOU worry yourself about
that stock old man ILL see that somebody else has the worry and you
the cash And as to the land andKittywell you hold on to them both
until you find out which the young man is really after

And then said Gabriel with a smile

Dont give him either But I say havent we had enough business this
morning Lets talk of something else Whos the French girl

Marie Shes the daughter of Jules du Pagedont you
rememberfathers friend When Jules died it was always thought
that father who had half adopted her as a child would leave her
some legacy But you know that father died without making a will and
thatrich as he washis actual assets were far less than we had reason
to expect Kitty who felt the disappointment as keenly as her friend I
believe would have divided her own share with her Its odd by the way
that father could have been so deceived in the amount of his capital
or how he got rid of his money in a way that we knew nothing of Do you
know Sylvester Ive sometimes suspected

What said Uncle Sylvester suddenly

The bored languor of his face had abruptly vanished Every muscle was
alert his gray eyes glittered

That he advanced money to Du Page who lost it or that they speculated
together returned Gabriel who following Uncle Sylvesters voice
only had not noticed the change of expression

That would seem to be a weakness of the Lane family said Uncle
Sylvester grimly with a return of his former carelessness But that is
not YOUR own opinionthats a suggestion of some one else

Well said Gabriel with a laugh and a slight addition of color it
WAS Gunns theory As a man of the world and a practical financier you
know

And youve talked with HIM about it

Yes It was a matter of general wonder years ago

Very likelybut just now dont you think weve had enough financial
talk said Uncle Sylvester with a bored contraction of his eyebrows
Come looking around the room youve changed the interior of the old
house

Yes Unfortunately just after fathers death it was put in the hands
of a local architect or builder one of fathers old friends but not
a very skillful workman who made changes while the family were away
Thats why your present bedroom which was fathers old study had a
slice taken off it to make the corridor larger and why the big chimney
and hearthstone are still there although the fireplace is modernized
That was Flints stupidity

Whose stupidity asked Uncle Sylvester trimming his nails

Flintsthe old architect

Why didnt you make him change it back again

He left Lakeville shortly after and I brought an architect from St
Louis after I returned from Europe But nothing could be done to your
room without taking down the chimney so it remained as Flint left it

That reminds me Gabriel Im afraid I spoke rather cavalierly to
Kitty last night about the arrangements of the room The fact is Ive
taken a fancy to it and should like to fit it up myself Have I your
permission

Certainly my dear Sylvester

Ive some knickknacks in my trunks and Ill do it at once

As you like

And youll see that I am not disturbed and youll explain it to Kitty
with my apologies

Yes

Then Im off

Gabriel glanced at his brother with a perplexed smile Here was the
bored traveler explorer goldseeker soldier of fortune actually as
pleased as a girl over the prospect of arranging his room He called
after him Sylvester

Yes

I say if you could you know just try to interest these people
tonight with some of your adventuressomething told SERIOUSLY you
know as if you really were in earnestId be awfully obliged to you
The fact isyoull excuse mebut they think you dont come up to
your reputation

They want a story

Yesone of your experiences

Ill give them one Tata

For the rest of the day Uncle Sylvester was invisible although his
active presence in his room was betrayed by the sound of hammering and
moving of furniture As the remainder of the party were skating on
the lake this eccentricity was not remarked except by oneMarie du
Pagewho on pretense of a slight cold had stayed at home But with her
suspicions of the former night she had determined to watch the singular
relative of her friend Added to a natural loyalty to the Lanes she
was moved by a certain curiosity and fascination towards this
incomprehensible man

The house was very quiet when she stole out of her room and passed
softly along the corridor she examined the wall carefully to discover
anything that might have excited the visitors attention There were a
few large engravings hanging there could he have designed to replace
them by some others Suddenly she was struck with the distinct
conviction that the wall of the corridor did not coincide with the wall
of his room as represented by the line of the door There was certainly
a space between the two walls unaccounted for This was undoubtedly what
had attracted HIS attention but what BUSINESS was it of his

She reflected that she had seen in the wall of the conservatory an old
closed staircase now used as shelves for dried herbs and seeds which
she had been told was the oldtime communication between the garden
and Grandfather Lanes studythe room now occupied by the stranger
Perhaps it led still farther and thus accounted for the space
Determined to satisfy herself she noiselessly descended to the
conservatory There surely was the staircasea narrow flight of
wooden steps encumbered with packages of herbslosing itself in upper
darkness By the aid of a candle she managed to grope and pick her way
up step by step Then she paused The staircase had abruptly ended on
the level of the study now cut off from it by the new partition She
was in a stifling inclosure formed by the walls scarcely eighteen
inches wide It was made narrower by a singular excrescence on the old
wall which seemed to have been a bricked closet now half destroyed
and in ruins She turned to descend when a strange sound from Uncle
Sylvesters room struck her ear It was the sound of tapping on the
floor close to the partition within a foot of where she was standing
At the same moment there was a decided movement of the plank of the
flooring beneath the partition it began to slide slowly and then was
gradually withdrawn into the room With prompt presence of mind she
instantly extinguished her candle and drew herself breathlessly against
the partition

When the plank was entirely withdrawn a ray of light slipped through
the opening revealing the bare rafters of the floor and a hand and arm
inserted under the partition groping as if towards the bricked closet
As the fingers of the exploring hand were widely extended Marie had no
difficulty in recognizing on one of them a peculiar signet ring which
Uncle Sylvester wore A swift impulse seized her To the audacious Marie
impulse and action were the same thing Bending stealthily over the
aperture she suddenly snatched the ring from the extended finger The
hand was quickly withdrawn with a start and uncontrolled exclamation
and she availed herself of that instant to glide rapidly down the
stairs

She regained her room stealthily having the satisfaction a moment later
of hearing Uncle Sylvesters door open and the sound of his footsteps in
the corridor But he was evidently unable to discover any outer ingress
to the inclosure or believed the loss of his ring an accident for he
presently returned Meantime what was she to do

Tell Kitty of her discovery and show the ring Nonot yet Oddly
enough now that she had the ring taken from his wicked finger in
the very act she found it as difficult as ever to believe in his
burglarious design She must wait The mischiefif there had been
mischiefwas done the breaking in of the bricked closet was from the
appearance of the ruins a bygone act Could it have been some youthful
escapade of Uncle Sylvesters the scene of which he was revisiting as
criminals are compelled to do And had there been anything taken from
the closetor was its destruction a part of the changes in the old
house How could she find out without asking Kitty There was one way
She remembered that Mr Gunn had once shown a great deal of interest
to Kitty about the old homestead and even of old Mr Lanes woodland
cabin She would ask HIM It was a friendly act for Kitty had not of
late been very kind to him

The opportunity presented itself at dusk as Mr Gunn somewhat
abstracted stood apart at the drawingroom window Marie hoped he had
enjoyed himself while skating her stupid cold had kept her indoors She
had amused herself rambling about the old homestead it was such a queer
place so full of old nooks and corners and unaccountable spaces Just
the place she would think where old treasures might have been stored
Eh

Mr Gunn had not spokenhe had only coughed But in the darkness his
eyes were fixed angrily on her face Without observing it she went on
She knew he was interested in the old house she had heard him talk
to Kitty about it had Kitty ever said anything about some old secret
hoarding place

No certainly not And she was mistaken he never was interested in
the house He could not understand what had put that idea in her head
Unless it was this ridiculous shady stranger in the guise of an uncle
whom they had got there It was like his affectation

Oh dear no said Marie with unmistakable truthfulness HE did not
say anything But with sudden inconsistent aggression is THAT the
way you speak to Kitty of her uncle

Really he didnt knowhe was joking only and he was afraid he must
just now ask her to excuse him He had received letters that made it
possible that he might be called suddenly to New York at any moment
Marie stared It was evident that he had proposed to Kitty and been
rejected But she was no nearer her discovery

Nor was there the least revelation in the calm halfbored yet
goodhumored presence of the wicked uncle at dinner So indifferent
did he seem not only to his own villainy but even to the loss it had
entailed that she had a wild impulse to take the ring from her pocket
and display it on her own finger before him then and there But the
conviction that he would in some way be equal to the occasion prevented
her The dinner passed off with some constraint no doubt emanating from
the conscious Kitty and Gunn Nevertheless when they had returned to
the drawingroom Gabriel rubbed his hands expectantly

I prevailed on Sylvester this morning to promise to tell us some of his
experiencessomething COMPLETE and satisfactory this time Eh

Uncle Sylvester warming his cold blood before the fire looked
momentarily forgetful anddisappointing Cousins Jane and Emma shrugged
their shoulders

Eh said Uncle Sylvester absently ereroh yes Well more
cheerfully about what eh

Let it be said Marie pointedly fixing her black magnetic eyes on the
wicked stranger let it be something about the DISCOVERY of gold or a
buried TREASURE HOARD or a robbery

To her intense disgust Uncle Sylvester far from being discomfited or
confused actually looked pleased and his gray eyes thawed slightly

Certainly he said Well then Down on the San Joaquin River there
was an old chapone of the earliest settlersin fact hed come on
from Oregon before the gold discovery His name dear mecontinued
Uncle Sylvester with an effort of memory and apparently beginning
already to lose his interest in the storywaserFlint

As Uncle Sylvester paused here Cousin Jane broke in impatiently Well
thats not an uncommon name There was an old carpenter here in your
fathers time who was called Flint

Yes said Uncle Sylvester languidly But there is or was something
uncommon about itand thats the point of the story for in the old
time Flint and Gunn were of the same stock

Is this a Californian joke said Gunn with a forced smile on his
flushed face If so spare me for its an old one

Its much older HISTORY Mr Gunn said Uncle Sylvester blandly
which I remember from a boy When the first Flint traded near Sault
Sainte Marie the Canadian voyageurs literally translated his name into
Pierre a Fusil and he went by that name always But when the English
superseded the French in numbers and language the name was literally
translated back again into Peter Gunn which his descendants bear

A labored form of the old joke said Gunn turning contemptuously
away

But the story said Cousins Jane and Emma The story of the gold
discoverynever mind the names

Excuse me said Uncle Sylvester placing his hand in the breast of his
coat with a delightful exaggeration of offended dignity But doubts
having been cast upon my preliminary statement I fear I must decline
proceeding further Nevertheless he smiled unblushingly at Miss Du
Page as he followed Gunn from the room

The next morning those who had noticed the strained relations of Miss
Kitty and Mr Gunn were not surprised that the latter was recalled on
pressing business to New York by the first train but it was a matter of
some astonishment to Gabriel Lane and Marie du Page that Uncle Sylvester
should have been up early and actually accompanied that gentleman
as far as the station Indeed the languid explorer and goldseeker
exhibited remarkable activity and clad in a rough tourist suit
announced over the breakfasttable his intention of taking a long
tramp through the woods which he had not revisited since a boy To this
end he had even provided himself with a small knapsack and for once
realized Kittys ideal of his character

Dont go too far said Gabriel for although the cold has moderated
the barometer is falling fast and there is every appearance of snow
Take care you are not caught in one of our blizzards

But YOU are all going on the lake to skate protested Uncle Sylvester

Yes for the very reason that it may be our last chance but should it
snow we shall be nearer home than you may be

Nevertheless when it came on to snow as Gabriel had predicted the
skating party was by no means so near home as he had imagined A shrewd
keenness and some stimulating electric condition of the atmosphere had
tempted the young people far out on the lake and they had ignored the
first fall of fine grayish granulations that swept along the icy surface
like little puffs of dust or smoke Then the fall grew thicker the gray
sky contracted the hurrying flakes dashed against them by a fierce
northwester were larger heavier and seemed an almost palpable force
that held them back Their skates already clogged with drift were
beginning to be useless The bare windswept spaces were becoming rarer
they could only stumble on blindly towards the nearest shore Nor when
they reached it were they yet safe they could scarcely stand against
the still increasing storm that was fast obliterating the banks and
stretch of meadow beyond Their only hope of shelter was the range of
woods that joined the hill Holding hands in single file the
little party consisting of Kitty Marie and Cousins Jane and
Emmastouthearted Gabriel leading and Cousin John bringing up the
rearat last succeeded in reaching it and were rejoiced to find
themselves near old Lanes halfruined cabin To their added joy and
astonishment whiffs of whirling smoke were issuing from the crumbling
chimney They ran to the crazy door pushed aside its weak fastening
and foundUncle Sylvester calmly enjoying a pipe before a blazing fire
A small pickaxe and crowbar were lying upon a mound of freshly turned
earth beside the chimney where the rotten flooring had been torn up

The tumultuous entrance of the skating party required no explanation
but when congratulations had been exchanged the wet snow shaken off
and they had drawn round the fire curious eyes were cast upon the
solitary occupant and the pile of earth and debris before him

I believe said Gabriel laughingly that you have been so bored here
that you have actually played at goldhunting for amusement

Uncle Sylvester took the pipe from his mouth and nodded

Its a common diversion of yours said Marie audaciously

Uncle Sylvester smiled sweetly

And have you been successful THIS TIME asked Marie

I got the color

Eh

Uncle Sylvester rose and placed himself with his back to the fire
gently surveying the assembled group

I was interrupted in a story of golddigging last evening he said
blandly How far had I got

You were down on the San Joaquin River in the spring of 50 with a
chap named Flint chorused Cousins Jane and Emma promptly

Ah yes said Uncle Sylvester Well in those days there was a
scarcity of money in the diggings Gold dust there was in plenty but no
COIN You can fancy it was a bother to weigh out a pinch of dust every
time you wanted a drink of whiskey or a pound of flour but there was
no other legal tender Pretty soon however a lot of gold and silver
pieces found their way into circulation in our camp and the camps around
us They were foreignold French and English coins Heres one of
them that I kept He took from his pocket a gold coin and handed it to
Gabriel

Lane rose to his feet with an exclamation

Why this is like the louisdor that grandfather saved through the war
and gave to father

Uncle Sylvester took the coin back placed it in his left eye like a
monocle and winked gravely at the company

It is the SAME he went on quietly I was interested for I had a
good memory and I remembered that as a boy grandfather had shown
me one of those coins and told me he was keeping them for old Jules du
Page who didnt believe in banks and banknotes Well I traced them to
a trader called Flint who was shipping gold dust from Stockton to Peter
Gunn  Sons in New York

To whom asked Gabriel quickly

Old Gunnthe father of your friend said Uncle Sylvester blandly We
talked the matter over on our way to the station this morning Well to
return Flint only said that he had got them from a man called Thompson
who had got them from somebody else in exchange for goods A year or
two afterwards this same Thompson happened to be frozen up with me in
Starvation Camp When he thought he was dying he confessed that he had
been bribed by Flint to say what he had said but that he believed the
coins were stolen Meantime Flint had disappeared Other things claimed
my attention I had quite forgotten him until one night five years
afterwards I blundered into a deserted miningcamp by falling asleep
on my mule who carried me across a broken flume butI think I told
you that story already

You never finished it said Cousin Jane sharply

Let me do so now then I was really saved by some Indians who took me
for a spirit up aloft there in the moonlight and spread the alarm The
first white man they brought me was a wretched drunkard known to the
boys as Old Fusil or Fusel Oil who went into delirium tremens at
the sight of me Well who do you suppose he turned out to be Flint
Flint played out and ruined Cast off and discarded by his relations in
New Yorkthe foundation of whose fortunes he had laid by the villainy
they had accepted and condoned For Flint as the carpenter of the old
homestead had discovered the existence of a bricked closet in the wall
of fathers study partitioned it off so that he could break into it
without detection and rifle it at his leisure and who had thus carried
off that part of grandfathers hoard which father had concealed there
He knew it could never be missed by the descendants But through haste
or ignorance he DID NOT TOUCH THE PAPERS and documents also hidden
there And THEY told of the existence of grandfathers second cache or
hidingplace beneath this hearth and were left for me to discover

He coolly relit his pipe fixed his eyes on Marie without apparently
paying attention to the breathless scrutiny of the others and went on
Flint alias Pierre a Fusil alias Gunn died a maniac I resolved to
test the truth of his story I came here I knew the old homestead as
a boy who had wandered over every part of it far better than you
Gabriel or any one The elder Gunn had only heard of it through the
criminal disclosure of his relative and only wished to absorb it
through his son in time and thus obliterate all trace of Flints
outrage I recognized the room perfectlythanks to our dear Kitty who
had taken up the carpet which thus disclosed the loose plank before the
closet that was hidden by the partition Under pretext of rearranging
the roomfor which Kitty will forgive meI spent the day behind a
locked door making my way through the partition There I found the
rifled closet but the papers intact They contained a full description
of the sum taken by Flint and also of a larger sum buried in a cask
beside this chimney I had just finished unearthing it a few moments
before you came I had at first hoped to offer it to the family as a
Christmas gift tomorrow butHe stopped and sucked slowly at his
pipe

We anticipated you said Gabriel laughing

No said Uncle Sylvester coolly But because it dont happen to
belong to YOU at all According to the paper I have in my pocket which
is about as legal a document as I ever saw it is fathers free gift to
Miss Marie du Page

Kitty threw her arms around her white and breathless friend with
a joyful cry and honest Gabriels face shone with unselfish
gratification

For yourself my dear Gabriel you must be satisfied with the fact that
Messrs Peter Gunn  Sons will take back your wildcat stock at the price
you paid for it It is the price they pay for their share in this little
transaction as I had the honor of pointing out to Mr Gunn on our way
to the station this morning

Then you think that young Mr Gunn knew that Flint was his relation
and that he had stolen fathers money said Kitty and that Mr Gunn
only wanted toShe stopped with flashing eyes

I think he would have liked to have made an arrangement my dear
that would keep the secret and the property in the family said Uncle
Sylvester But I dont think he suspected the existence of the second
treasure here

And then sir said Cousin Jane it appears that all these wretched
unsatisfactory scraps of stories you were telling us were nothing after
all but

My way of telling THIS one said Uncle Sylvester

As the others were eagerly gathering around the unearthed treasure
Marie approached him timidly all her audacity gone tears in her eyes
and his ring held hesitatingly between her fingers How can I thank
youand how CAN you ever forgive me

Well said Uncle Sylvester gazing at her critically you might keep
the ring to think over it

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
