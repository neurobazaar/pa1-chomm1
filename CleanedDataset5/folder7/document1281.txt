TOM SWIFT AND HIS AERIAL WARSHIP




CHAPTER I

TOM IS PUZZLED


Whats the matter Tom You look rather blue

Blue Say Ned Id turn red green yellow or any other color of the
rainbow if I thought it would help matters any

Whew

Ned Newton the chum and companion of Tom Swift gave vent to a whistle
of surprise as he gazed at the young fellow sitting opposite him near
a bench covered with strangelooking tools and machinery while
blueprints and drawings were scattered about

Ranged on the sides of the room were models of many queer craft most
of them flying machines of one sort or another while through the open
door that led into a large shed could be seen the outlines of a speedy
monoplane

As bad as that eh Tom went on Ned I thought something was up
when I first came in but if youll excuse a second mention of the
color scheme I should say it was bluedecidedly blue You look as
though you had lost your last friend and I want to assure you that if
you do feel that way its dead wrong Theres myself for one and
Im sure Mr Damon

Bless my gasoline tank exclaimed Tom with a laugh in imitation of
the gentleman Ned Newton had mentioned I know that Im not worrying
over the loss of any friends

And there are Eradicate and Koku the giant just to mention a couple
of others went on Ned with a smile

Thats enough exclaimed Tom It isnt that I tell you

Well what is it then Here I go and get a halfholiday off from the
bank and just at the busiest time too to come and see you and I
find you in a brown study looking as blue as indigo and maybe youre
all yellow inside from a bilious attack for all I know

Quite a combination of colors admitted Tom But it isnt what you
think Its just that Im puzzled Ned

Puzzled and Ned raised his eyebrows to indicate how surprised he was
that anything should puzzle his friend

Yes genuinely puzzled

Has anything gone wrong Ned asked No one is trying to take any of
your pet inventions away from you is there

No not exactly that though it is about one of my inventions I am
puzzled I guess I havent shown you my very latest have I Ned

Well I dont know Tom Time was when I could keep track of you and
your inventions but that was in your early days when you started with
a motorcycle and were glad enough to have a motorboat But since
youve taken to aerial navigation and submarine work not to mention
one or two other lines of activity I give up I dont know where to
look next Tom for something new

Well this isnt so very new went on the young inventor for Tom
Swift had designed and patented many new machines of the air earth and
water Im just trying to work out some new problems in aerial
navigation Ned he went on

I thought there werent any more spoke Ned soberly enough

Come now none of that exclaimed Tom with a laugh Why the
surface of aerial navigation has only been scratched The science is
far from being understood or even made safe not to say perfected as
water and land travel have been Theres lots of chance yet

And youre working on something new asked Ned as he looked around
the shop where he and Tom were sitting As the young bank employee had
said he had come away from the institution that afternoon to have a
little holiday with his chum but Tom seated in the midst of his
inventions seemed little inclined to jollity

Through the open windows came the hum of distant machinery for Tom
Swift and his father were the heads of a company founded to manufacture
and market their many inventions and about their home were grouped
several buildings From a small plant the business had grown to be a
great tree under the direction of Tom and his father

Yes Im working on something new admitted Tom after a moment of
silence

And Ned he went on theres no reason why you shouldnt see it
Ive been keeping it a bit secret until I had it a little further
advanced but Ive got to a point now where Im stuck and perhaps it
will do me good to talk to someone about it

Not to talk to me though Im afraid What I dont know about
machinery Tom would fill a great many books I dont see how I can
help you and Ned laughed

Well perhaps you can just the same though you may not know a lot of
technical things about machines It sometimes helps me just to tell my
troubles to a disinterested person and hear him ask questions Ive
got dad half distracted trying to solve the problem so Ive had to let
up on him for a while Come on out and see what you make of it

Sure Tom anything to oblige If you want me to sit in front of your
phototelephone and have my picture taken Im agreeable even if you
shoot off a flashlight at my ear Or if you want me to see how long I
can stay under water without breathing Ill try that too provided you
dont leave me under too long lead the wayIm agreeable as far as
Im able old man

Oh it isnt anything like that Tom answered with a laugh I might
as well give you a few hints so youll know what Im driving at Then
Ill take you out and show it to you

What is itair earth or water asked Ned Newton for he knew his
chums activities led along all three lines

This happens to be air

A new balloon

Something like that I call it my aerial warship though

Aerial warship Tom That sounds rather dangerous

It will be dangerous too if I can get it to work Thats what its
intended for

But a warship of the air cried Ned You cant mean it A warship
carries guns mortars bombs and

Yes I know interrupted Tom and I appreciate all that when I
called my newest craft an aerial warship

But objected Ned an aircraft that will carry big guns will be so
large that

Oh mine is large enough Tom broke in

Then its finished cried Ned eagerly for he was much interested in
his chums inventions

Well not exactly Tom said But what I was going to tell you was
that all guns are not necessarily large You can get big results with
small guns and projectiles now for highpowered explosives come in
small packages So it isnt altogether a question of carrying a certain
amount of weight Of course an aerial warship will have to be big for
it will have to carry extra machinery to give it extra speed and it
will have to carry a certain armament and a large crew will be needed
So as I said it will need to be large But that problem isnt
worrying me

Well what is it then asked Ned

Its the recoil said Tom with a gesture of despair

The recoil questioned Ned wonderingly

Yes from the guns you know I havent been able to overcome that
and until I do Im afraid my latest invention will be a failure

Ned shook his head

Im afraid I cant help you any he said The only thing I know
about recoils is connected with an old shotgun my father used to own

I took that once when he didnt know it Ned proceeded It was
pretty heavily loaded for the crows had been having fun in our
cornfield and dad had been shooting at them This time I thought Id
take a chance

Well I fired the gun But it must have had a double charge in it and
been rusted at that All I know is that after I pulled the trigger I
thought the end of the world had come I heard a clap of thunder and
then I went flying over backward into a blackberry patch

That was the recoil said Tom

The what asked Ned

The recoil The recoil of the gun knocked you over

Oh yes observed Ned rubbing his shoulder in a reflective sort of
way I always thought it was something like that But at the time I
put it down to an explosion and let it go at that

No it wasnt an explosion properly speaking said Tom You see
when powder explodes in a gun or otherwise its force is exerted in
all directions up down and every way

This went mostly backwardin my direction said Ned ruefully

You only thought so returned Tom Most of the power went out in
front to force out the shot Part of it of course was exerted on the
barrel of the gunthat was sidewaysbut the strength of the steel
held it in And part of the force went backward against your shoulder
That part was the recoil and it is the recoil of the guns I figure on
putting aboard my aerial warship that is giving me such trouble

Is that what makes you look so blue asked Ned

Thats it I cant seem to find a way by which to take up the recoil
and the force of it from all the guns I want to carry will just about
tear my ship to pieces I figure

Then you havent actually tried it out yet asked Ned

Not the guns no I have the warship of the air nearly done but Ive
worked out on paper the problem of the guns far enough so that I know
Im up against it It cant be done and an aerial warship without guns
wouldnt be worth much Im afraid

I suppose not agreed Ned And is it only the recoil that is
bothering you

Mostly But come take a look at my latest pet and Tom arose to lead
the way to another shed a large one in the distance toward which he
waved his hand to indicate to his chum that there was housed the
wonderful invention

The two chums crossed the yard threading their way through the various
buildings until they stood in front of the structure to which Tom had
called attention

Its in here he said I dont mind admitting that Im quite proud
of it Ned that is proud as far as Ive gone But the gun business
sure has me worried Im going to talk it off on you Hello cried
Tom suddenly as he put a key in the complicated lock on the door
someone has been in here I wonder who it is

Ned was a little startled at the look on Toms face and the sound of
alarm in his chums voice




CHAPTER II

A FIRE ALARM


Tom Swift quickly opened the door of the big shed It was built to
house a dirigible balloon or airship of some sort Ned could easily
tell that from his knowledge of Toms previous inventions

Something wrong asked the young bank clerk

I dont know returned Tom and then as he looked inside the place
he breathed a sigh of relief

Oh its you is it Koku he asked as a veritable giant of a man
came forward

Yes master it is only Koku and your father spoke the big chap
with rather a strange accent

Oh is my father here asked Tom I was wondering who had opened the
door of this shed

Yes Tom responded the elder Swift coming up to them I had a new
idea in regard to some of those side guy wires and I wanted to try it
out I brought Koku with me to use his strength on some of them

Thats all right Dad Ned and I came out to wrestle with that recoil
problem again I want to try some guns on the craft soon but

Youd better not Tom warned his father It will never work I tell
you You cant expect to take up quickfiring guns and bombs in an
airship and have them work properly Better give it up

I never will Ill make it work Dad

I dont believe you will Tom This time you have bitten off more than
you can chew to use a homely but expressive statement

Well Dad well see began Tom easily There she is Ned he went
on Now if youll come around here

But Tom never finished that sentence for at that moment there came
running into the airship shed an elderly short stout fussy
gentleman followed by an aged colored man Both of them seemed very
much excited

Bless my socks Tom cried the short stout man There sure is
trouble

I should say So Massa Tom added the colored man I done did
prognosticate dat some day de combustible material of which dat shed am
composed would conflaggrate

Whats the matter interrupted Tom jumping forward Speak out
Eradicate Mr Damon what is it

The red shed cried the short little man The red shed Tom

Its on fire yelled the colored man

Great thunderclaps cried Tom Come oneverybody on the job he
yelled Koku pull the alarm If that red shed goes

Instantly the place was in confusion Tom and Ned looking from a
window of the hangar saw a billow of black smoke roll across the yard
But already the private fire bell was clanging out its warning And
while the work of fighting the flames is under way I will halt the
progress of this story long enough to give my new readers a little idea
of who Tom Swift is so they may read this book more intelligently
Those of you who have perused the previous volumes may skip this part

Tom Swift though rather young in years was an inventor of note His
tastes and talents were developed along the line of machinery and
locomotion Motorcycles automobiles motorboats submarine craft and
latest of all craft of the air had occupied the attention of Tom
Swift and his father for some years

Mr Swift was a widower and lived with Tom his only son in the
village of Shopton New York State Mrs Baggert kept house for them
and an aged colored man Eradicate Sampson with his mule Boomerang
did odd jobs about the Shopton home and factories

Among Toms friends was a Mr Wakefield Damon from a nearby village
Mr Damon was always blessing something from his hat to his shoes a
harmless sort of habit that seemed to afford him much comfort Then
there was Ned Newton a boyhood chum of Toms who worked in the
Shopton bank I will just mention Mary Nestor a young lady of Shopton
in whom Tom was more than ordinarily interested I have spoken of Koku
the giant He really was a giant of a man of enormous strength and
was one of two whom Tom had brought with him from a strange land where
Tom was held captive for a time You may read about it in a book
devoted to those adventures

Tom took Koku into his service somewhat to the dismay of Eradicate
who was desperately jealous But poor Eradicate was getting old and
could not do as much as he thought he could So in a great measure
Koku replaced him and Tom found much use for the giants strength

Tom had begun his inventive work when some years before this story
opens he had bargained for Mr Damons motorcycle after that machine
had shot its owner into a tree Mr Damon was naturally perhaps much
disgusted and sold the affair cheap Tom repaired it made some
improvements and in the first volume of this series entitled Tom
Swift and His Motorcycle you may read of his rather thrilling
adventures on his speedy roadsteed

From then on Tom had passed a busy life making many machines and
having some thrilling times with them Just previous to the opening of
this story Tom had made a peculiar instrument described in the volume
entitled Tom Swift and His PhotoTelephone With that a person
talking could not only see the features of the person with whom he was
conversing but by means of a selenium plate and a sort of camera a
permanent picture could be taken of the person at either end of the
wire

By means of this invention Tom had been able to make a picture that had
saved a fortune But Tom did not stop there With him to invent was as
natural and necessary as breathing He simply could not stop it And so
we find him now about to show to his chum Ned Newton his latest
patent an aerial warship which however was not the success Tom had
hoped for

But just at present other matters than the warship were in Toms mind
The red shed was on fire

That mere statement might not mean anything special to the ordinary
person but to Tom his father and those who knew about his shops it
meant much

The red shed Tom cried We mustnt let that get the best of us
Everybody at work Father not you though You mustnt excite
yourself

Even in the midst of the alarm Tom thought of his father for the aged
man had a weak heart and had on one occasion nearly expired being
saved just in time by the arrival of a doctor whom Tom brought to the
scene after a wonderful race through the air

But Tom I can help objected the aged inventor

Now you just take care of yourself Father Tom cried There are
enough of us to look after this fire I think

But Tom itits the red shed gasped Mr Swift

I realize that Dad But it cant have much of a start yet Is the
alarm ringing Koku

Yes Master replied the giant in correct but stilted English I
have set the indicator to signal the alarm in every shop on the
premises

Thats right Tom sprang toward the door Eradicate he called

Yais sah Heah I is answered the colored man Ill go git mah
mule Boomerang right away an he

Dont you bring Boomerang on the scene Tom yelled When I want that
shed kicked apart I can do it better than by using a mules heels And
you know you cant do a thing with Boomerang when he sees fire

Now dats so Massa Tom But I could put blinkers on him an

No you let Boomerang stay where he is Come on Ned Well see what
we can do Mr Damon

Yes Tom Im right here answered the peculiar man for he had come
over from his home in Waterford to pay a visit to his friends Tom and
Mr Swift Ill do anything I can to help you Tom bless my necktie
he went on Only say the word

Weve got to get some of the stuff out of the place Tom cried We
may be able to save it but I cant take a chance on putting out the
fire and letting some of the things in there go up in smoke Come on

Those in the shed where was housed what Tom hoped would prove to be a
successful aerial warship rushed to the open From the other shops and
buildings nearby were pouring men and boys for the Swift plant
employed a number of hands now

Above the shouts and yells above the crackle of flames could be heard
the clanging of the alarm bell set ringing by Koku who had pulled the
signal in the airship shed From there it had gone to every building in
the plant being relayed by the telephone operator whose duty it was
to look after that

My youve got a big enough firefighting force Tom cried Ned in
his chums ear

Yes I guess we can master it if it hasnt gotten the best of us
Say its going some though

Tom pointed to where a shed painted reda sign of dangercould be
seen partly enveloped in smoke amid the black clouds of which shot out
red tongues of flame

What have you got it painted red for Ned asked pantingly as they
ran on

Because Tom began but the rest of the sentence was lost in a yell

Tom had caught sight of Eradicate and the giant Koku unreeling from a
central standpipe a long line of hose

Dont take that Tom cried Dont use that hose Drop it

Whats the matter Is it rotten Ned wanted to know

No but if they pull it out the water will be turned on automatically

Well isnt that what you want at a firewater Ned demanded

Not at this fire was Toms answer Theres a lot of calcium carbide
in that red shedthats why its redto warn the men of danger You
know what happens when water gets on carbidetheres an explosion and
theres enough carbide in that shed to send the whole works sky high

Drop that hose yelled Tom in louder tones Drop it RadKoku Do
you want to kill us all




CHAPTER III

A DESPERATE BATTLE


Toms tones and voice were so insistent that the giant and the colored
man had no choice but to obey They dropped the hose which half
unreeled lay like some twisted snake in the grass Had it been pulled
out all the way the water would have spurted from the nozzle for it
was of the automatic variety with which Tom had equipped all his plant

But what are you going to do Tom if you dont use water asked Ned
wonderingly

I dont knowyet but I know water is the worst thing you can put on
carbide returned Tom For all he spoke Slowly his brain was working
fast Already even now he was planning how best to give battle to the
flames

It needed but an instants thought on the part of Ned to make him
understand that Tom was right It would be wellnigh fatal to use water
on carbide Those of you who have bicycle lanterns in which that not
very pleasantsmelling chemical is used know that if a few drops of
water are allowed to drip slowly on the gray crystals acetylene gas is
generated which makes a brilliant light But if the water drips too
fast the gas is generated too quickly and an explosion results In
lamps of course and in lighting plants where carbide is used there
are automatic arrangements to prevent the water flowing too freely to
the chemical But Tom knew if the hose were turned on the fire in the
red shed a great explosion would result for some of the tins of
carbide would be melted by the heat

Yet the fire needed to be coped with Already the flames were coming
through the roof and the windows and door were spouting red fire and
volumes of smoke

Several other employees of Toms plant had made ready to unreel more
hose but the warning of the young inventor shouted to Eradicate and
Koku had had its effect Every man dropped the line he had begun to
unreel

Ha Massa Tom say drop de hose but how yo gwine t squirt watah on
a fire wifout a hose answer me dat and Eradicate looked at Koku

Me no know was the slow answer I guess Koku go pull shed down and
stamp out fire

Huh Maybe yo could do dat in cannibal land where yo all come
from spoke Eradicate but yo cant do dat heah Sides de red shed
will blow up soon Deres suffin else in dere except carbide an
dats gwine t go up soon dats suah

Maybe you get your strong manmule Boomerang suggested Koku
Nothing ever hurt himexplosion or nothing He can kick shed all to
pieces and put out fire

Dats what I wanted t do but Massa Tom say I caint explained the
colored man Golly Look at dat fire

Indeed the blaze was now assuming alarming proportions The red shed
which was not a small structure was blazing on all sides About it
stood the men from the various shops

Tom you must do something said Mr Swift If the flames once reach
that helmanite

I know Father But that explosive is in double vacuum containers and
it will be safe for some time yet Besides its in the cellar Its
the carbide Im most worried about We darent use water

But something will have to be done exclaimed Mr Damon Bless my
red necktie if we dont

Better get back a way suggested Tom Something may go off

His words of warning had their effect and the whole circle moved back
several paces

Is there anything of value in the shed asked Ned

I should say there was Tom answered I hoped we could get some of
them out but we cant nowuntil the fire dies down a bit at any
rate

Look Tom The pattern shop roof is catching shouted Mr Swift
pointing to where a little spurt of flame showed on the roof of a
distant building

Its from sparks Tom said

Any danger of using water there Ned wanted to know

No use all you like Thats the only thing to do Come on you with
the hose Tom yelled Save the other buildings

But are you going to let the red shed burn asked Mr Swift You
know what it means Tom

Yes Father I know And Im going to fight that fire in a new way
But we must save the other buildings too Play water on all the other
sheds and structures ordered the young inventor Ill tackle this
one myself Oh Ned he called

Yes answered his chum What is it

You take charge of protecting the place where the new aerial warship
is stored Will you I cant afford to lose that

Ill look after it Tom No harm in using water there though is
there

Not if you dont use too much Some of the woodwork isnt varnished
yet and I wouldnt want it to be wet But do the best you can Take
Koku and Eradicate with you They cant do any good here

Do you mean to say youre going to give up and let this burn

Not a bit of it Ned But I have another plan I want to try Lively
now The winds changing and its blowing over toward my aerial
warship shed If that catches

Tom shook his head protestingly and Ned set off on the run calling to
the colored man and the giant to get out another line of hose

I wonder what Tom is going to do mused Ned as he neared the big
shed he and the others had left on the alarm of fire

Tom himself seemed in no doubt as to his procedure With one look at
the blazing red shed as if to form an opinion as to how much longer it
could burn without getting entirely beyond control Tom set off on a
run toward another large structure Ned glancing toward his chum
observed

The dirigible shed I wonder what his game is Surely that cant be
in dangerits too far off

Ned was right as to the last statement The shed where was housed a
great dirigible balloon Tom had made but which he seldom used of late
was sufficiently removed from the zone of fire to be out of danger

Meanwhile several members of the firefighting force that had been
summoned from the various shops by the alarm had made an effort to
save from the red shed some of the more valuable of the contents There
were some machines in there as well as explosives and chemicals in
addition to the store of carbide

But the fire was now too hot to enable much to be done in the way of
salvage One or two small things were carried out from a little
addition to the main structure and then the rescuers were driven back
by the heat of the flames as well as by the rolling clouds of black
smoke

Keep away warned Mr Swift It will explode soon Keep back

Thats right added Mr Damon Bless my powderhorn We may all be
going skyhigh soon and without aid from any of Tom Swifts
aeroplanes either

Warned by the aged inventor the throng of men began slowly moving away
from the immediate neighborhood of the blazing shed Though it may
seem to the reader that some time has elapsed since the first sounding
of the alarm all that I have set down took place in a very short
periodhardly three minutes elapsing since Tom and the others came
rushing out of the aerial warship building

Suddenly a cry arose from the crowd of men near the red shed Ned who
stood ready with several lines of hose in charge of Koku Eradicate
and others to turn them on the airship shed in case of need looked
in the direction of the excited throng

The young bank clerk saw a strange sight From the top of the dirigible
balloon shed a long black cigarshaped body arose floating gradually
upward The very roof of the shed slid back out of the way as Tom
pressed the operating lever and the dirigible was free to riseas
free as though it had been in an open field

Hes going up cried Ned in surprise Making an ascent at a time
like this when he ought to stay here to fight the fire Whats gotten
into Tom Id like to know I wonder if he can be

Ned did not finish his halfformed sentence A dreadful thought came
into his mind What if the sudden fire and the threatened danger as
well as the prospective loss that confronted Tom had affected his mind

It certainly looks so mused Ned as he saw the big balloon float
free from the shed There was no doubt but that Tom was in it He could
be seen standing within the pilothouse operating the various wheels
and levers that controlled the ship of the air

What can he be up to marveled Ned Is he going to run away from the
fire

Koku Eradicate and several others were attracted by the sight of the
great dirigible now a considerable distance up in the air Certainly
it looked as though Tom Swift were running away Yet Ned knew his chum
better than that

Then as they watched Ned and the others saw the direction of the
balloon change She turned around in response to the influence of the
rudders and propellers and was headed straight for the blazing shed
but some distance above it

What can he be planning wondered Ned

He did not have long to wait to find out

An instant later Toms plan was made clear to his chum He saw Tom
circling over the burning red shed and then the bank clerk saw what
looked like fine rain dropping from the lower part of the balloon
straight into the flames

He cant be dousing water on from up above there reasoned Ned
Pouring water on carbide from a height is just as bad as spurting it
on from a hose though perhaps not so dangerous to the persons doing
it But it cant be

By Jove suddenly exclaimed Ned as he had a better view of what was
going on Its sand thats what it is Tom is giving battle to the
flames with sand from the ballast bags of the dirigible Hurray Thats
the ticket Sand The only thing safe to use in case of an explosive
chemical fire

Fine for you Tom Swift Fine




CHAPTER IV

SUSPICIONS


High up aloft over the blazing red shed with its dangerous contents
that any moment might explode Tom Swift continued to hold his big
dirigible balloon as near the flames as possible And as he stood
outside on the small deck in front of the pilothouse where were
located the various controls the young inventor pulled the levers that
emptied bag after bag of fine sand on the spouting flames that
already were beginning to die down as a result of this effectual
quenching

Toms done the trick yelled Ned paying little attention now to the
big airship shed since he saw that the danger was about over

Dhats what he suah hab done agreed Eradicate Mah ole mule
Boomerang couldnt a done any better

Huh Your mule afraid of fire remarked Koku

Whats dat Mah mule afraid ob fire cried the colored man Look
heah yo great big overgrowed specimen ob an equilateral quadruped
Ill hab yo all understand dat when yo all speaks dat way about a
friend ob mine dat yo

Thatll do Rad broke in Ned with a laugh He knew that when Toms
helper grew excited on the subject of his mule there was no stopping
him and Boomerang was a point on which Eradicate and Koku were always
arguing The fire is under control now

Yes it seems to have gone visiting observed Koku

Visiting queried Ned in some surprise

Yes that is it is going out went on Koku

Oh I understand laughed Ned Yes and I hope it doesnt pay us
another visit soon Oh look at Tom would you he cried for the
young aviator had swung his ship about over the flames to bring
another row of sand bags directly above a place where the fire was
hottest

Down showered more sand from the bags which Tom opened No fire could
long continue to blaze under that treatment The supply of air was cut
off and without that no fire can exist Water would have been worse
than useless because of the carbide but the sand covered it up so
that it was made perfectly harmless

Moving slowly the airship hovered over every part of the now slowly
expiring flames the burned opening in the roof of the shed making it
possible for the sand to reach the spots where it was most needed The
flames died out in section after section until no more could be
seenonly clouds of black smoke

How is it now came Toms voice as he spoke from the deck of the
balloon through a megaphone

Almost out answered Mr Damon A little more sand Tom

The eccentric man had caught up a piece of paper and rolling it into a
cone made an improvised megaphone of that

Havent much more sand left was Toms comment as he sent down a
last shower That will have to do Hustle that carbide and other
explosive stuff out of there now while you have a chance

Thats it cried Ned who caught his chums meaning Come on Koku
Theres work for you

Me like work answered the giant stretching out his great arms

The last of the sand had completely smothered the fire and Tom
observing from aloft that his work was well done moved away in the
dirigible sending it to a landing space some little distance away from
the shed whence it had arisen It was impossible to drop it back again
through the roof of the hangar as the balloon was of such bulk that
even a little breeze would deflect it so that it could not be
accurately anchored But Tom had it under very good control and soon
it was being held down on the ground by some of his helpers

As all the sand ballast had been allowed to run out Tom was obliged to
open the gasvalves and let some of the lifting vapor escape or he
could not have descended

Come on now cried the inventor as he leaped from the deck of his
sky craft Lets clean out the red shed That fire is only smothered
and there may be sparks smoldering under that sand which will burst
into flame if were not careful Lets get the explosives out of the
way

Bless my insurance policy yes exclaimed Mr Damon That was a fine
move of yours

It was the only way I could think of to put out the fire Tom
replied I knew water was out of the question and sand was the next
thing

But I didnt know where to get any until I happened to think of the
ballast bags of my dirigible Then I knew if I could get above the
fire I could do the trick I had to fly pretty high though as the
fire was hot and I was afraid it might explode the gas bag and wreck
me

You were taking a chance remarked Ned

Oh well you have to take chances in this business observed Tom
with a smile Now then lets finish this work

The sand falling from the ballast bags of the dirigible had so
effectually quenched the fire that it was soon cool enough to permit
close approach Koku Tom and some of the men who best knew how to
handle the explosives were soon engaged in the work of salvage

I wish I could help you Tom said his aged father I dont seem
able to do anything but stand here and look on and he gazed about him
rather sadly

Never you mind Dad Tom exclaimed Well get along all right now
Youd better go up to the house Mr Damon will go with you

Yes of course exclaimed the odd man catching a wink from Tom who
wanted his father not to get too excited on account of his weak heart
Come along Professor Swift The danger is all over

All right assented the aged inventor with a look at the still
smoking shed

And Dad when you havent anything else to do went on Tom rather
whimsically you might be thinking up some plan to take up the recoil
of those guns on my aerial warship I confess Im clean stumped on that
point

Your aerial warship will never be a success declared Mr Swift You
might as well give that up Tom

Dont you believe it Dad cried Tom with more of a jolly air of one
chum toward another than as though the talk was between father and son
You solve the recoil problem for me and Ill take care of the rest
and make the air warship sail But weve got something else to do just
now Lively boys

While Mr Swift taking Mr Damons arm walked toward the house Tom
Ned Koku and some of the workmen began carrying out the explosives
which had so narrowly escaped the fire With long hooks the men pulled
the shed apart where the side walls had partly been burned through
Tom maintained an efficient firefighting force at his works and the
men had the proper tools with which to work

Soon large openings were made on three sides of the red shed or
rather what was left of it and through these the dangerous chemicals
and carbide in sheetiron cans were carried out to a place of safety
In a little while nothing remained but a heap of hot sand some charred
embers and certain material that had been burned

Much loss Tom asked Ned as they surveyed the ruins They were both
black and grimy tired and dirty but there was a great sense of
satisfaction

Well yes theres more lost than I like to think of answered Tom
slowly but it would have been a heap sight worse if the stuff had
gone up Still I can replace what Ive lost except a few models I
kept in this place I really oughtnt to have stored them here but
since Ive been working on my new aerial warship I have sort of let
other matters slide I intended to make the red shed nothing but a
storehouse for explosive chemicals but I still had some of my plans
and models in it when it caught

Only for the sand the whole place might have gone said Ned in a low
voice

Yes Its lucky I had plenty of ballast aboard the dirigible You
see Ive been running it alone lately and I had to take on plenty of
sand to make up for the weight of the several passengers I usually
carry So I had plenty of stuff to shower down on the fire I wonder
how it started anyhow I must investigate this

Mr Damon and Eradicate seem to have seen it first remarked Ned

Yes At least they gave the alarm Guess Ill ask Eradicate how he
happened to notice Oh I say Rad Tom called to the colored man

Yais sah Massa Tom Ise comin the darky cried as he finished
piling up at a safe distance from the fire a number of cans of
carbide

Howd you happen to see the red shed ablaze Tom asked

Why it was jest dish yeah way Massa Tom began the colored man I
had jest been feedin mah mule Boomerang He were powful hungry
Boomerang were an when I give him some oats wif a carrot sliced up
in emno hole ondid I gib him a carrot tday or was it
yistdayI done fogot No it were yistday I done gib him de
carrot I member now case

Oh never mind the carrot or Boomerang either Rad broke in Tom
Im asking you about the fire

An Ise tellin yo Massa Tom declared Eradicate with a rather
reproachful look at his master But I wanted t do it right an
proper I were comin from Boomerangs stable an I see suffin red
spoutin up at one corner ob de red shed I knowed it were fire right
away an I yelled

Yes I heard you yell Tom said But what I wanted to know is did
you see anyone near the red shed at the time

No Massa Tom I done didnt

I wonder if Mr Damon did I must ask him went on the young
inventor Come on Ned well go up to the house Everything is all
right here I think Whew But that was some excitement And I didnt
show you my aerial warship after all Nor have you settled that recoil
problem for me

Time enough I guess responded Ned You sure did have a lucky
escape Tom

Thats right Well Koku what is it for the giant had approached
holding out something in his hand

Koku found this in red shed went on the giant holding out a round
blackened object Maybe him powder go bangbang

Oh you think its something explosive eh asked Tom as he took the
object from the giant

Koku no think much was the answer Him look funny

Tom did not speak for a moment Then he cried

Look funny I should say it did See here Ned if this isnt
suspicious Ill eat my hat and Tom beckoned excitedly to his chum
who had walked on a little in advance




CHAPTER V

A QUEER STRANGER


What Tom Swift held in his hand looked like a small cannon ball but it
could not have been solid or the young aviator would not so easily have
held it out at arms length for his friend Ned Newton to look at

This puts a different face on it Ned Tom went on as he turned the
object over

Is that likely to go off the bank clerk asked as he came to a halt
a little distance from his friend

Go off No its done all the damage it could I guess

Damage It looks to me as though it had suffered the most damage
itself What is it one of your models Looks like a bomb to me

And thats what it is Ned

Not one of those youre going to use on your aerial warship is it
Tom

Not exactly I never saw this before but its what started the fire
in the red shed all right Im sure of that

Do you really mean it cried Ned

I sure do

Well if thats the case I wouldnt leave such dangerous things
around where there are explosives Tom

I didnt Ned I wouldnt have had this within a hundred miles of my
shed if I could have had my way Its a fire bomb and it was set to
go off at a certain time Only I think something went wrong and the
bomb started a fire ahead of time

If it had worked at night when we were all asleep we might not have
put the fire out so easily This sure is suspicious Im glad you found
this Koku

Tom was carefully examining the bomb as Ned had correctly named it
The bank clerk now that he was assured by his chum that the object had
done all the harm it could approached closer

What he saw was merely a hollow shell of iron with a small opening in
it as though intended for a place through which to put a charge of
explosives and a fuse

But there was no explosion Tom explained Ned

I know it said Tom quietly It wasnt an explosive bomb Smell
that

He held the object under Neds nose so suddenly that the young bank
clerk jumped back

Oh dont get nervous laughed Tom It cant hurt you now But what
does that smell like

Ned sniffed sniffed again thought for a moment and then sniffed a
third time

Why he said slowly I dont just know the name of it but its that
funny stuff you mix up sometimes to put in the oxygen tanks when we go
up in the rarefied atmosphere in the balloon or airship

Manganese and potash spoke Tom That and two or three other things
that form a chemical combination which goes off by itself of
spontaneous combustion after a certain time Only the person who put
this bomb together didnt get the chemical mixture just right and it
went off ahead of time for which we have to be duly thankful

Do you really think that Tom cried Ned

Im positive of it was the quiet answer

Whywhythat would mean some one tried to set fire to the red shed
Tom

They not only tried it but did it responded Tom more coolly than
seemed natural under the circumstances Only for the fact that the
mixture went off before it was intended to and found us all alert and
readywell I dont like to think what might have happened and Tom
cast a look about at his group of buildings with their valuable
contents

You mean some one purposely put that bomb in the red shed Tom

Thats exactly what I mean Some enemy who wanted to do me an injury
planned this thing deliberately He filled this steel shell with
chemicals which of themselves after a certain time would send out a
hot tongue of flame through this hole and Tom pointed to the opening
in the round steel shell

He knew the fire would be practically unquenchable by ordinary means
and he counted on its soon eating its way into the carbide and other
explosives Only it didnt

Why Tom cried Ned It was just like one of those alarmclock
dynamite bombsset to go off at a certain time

Exactly Tom said only this was more delicate and if it had
worked properly there wouldnt have been a vestige left to give us a
clue But the fire thanks to the ballast sand in the dirigible was
put out in time The fuse burned itself out but I can tell by the
smell that chemicals were in it Thats all Koku he went on to the
giant who had stood waiting not understanding all the talk between Tom
and Ned Ill take care of this now

Bad man put it there asked the giant who at least comprehended that
something was wrong

Well yes I guess you could say it was a bad man replied Tom

Ha If Koku find bad manbad for that man muttered the giant as he
clasped his two enormous hands together as though they were already on
the fellow who had tried to do Tom Swift such an injury

I wouldnt like to be that man if Koku catches him observed Ned
Have you any idea who it could be Tom

Not the least Of course I know I have enemies Ned Every successful
inventor has persons who imagine he has stolen their ideas whether he
has ever seen them or not It may have been one of those persons or
some halfmad crank who was jealous It would be impossible to say
Ned

It wouldnt be Andy Foger would it

No I dont believe Andy has been in this neighborhood for some time
The last lesson we gave him sickened him I guess

How about those diamondmakers whose secret you discovered They
wouldnt be trying to get back at you would they

Well its possible Ned But I dont imagine so They seem to have
been pretty well broken up No I dont believe it was the
diamondmakers who put this fire bomb in the red shed Their line of
activities didnt include this branch It takes a chemist to know just
how to blend the things contained in the bomb and even a good chemist
is likely to failas this one did as far as time went

What are you going to do about it Ned asked

I dont know and Tom spoke slowly I hoped I was done with all that
sort of thing he went on fighting enemies whom I have never
knowingly injured But it seems they are still after me Well Ned
this gives us something to do at all events

You mean trying to find out who these fellows are

Yes that is if you are willing to help

Well I guess I am cried the bank clerk with sparkling eyes I
wouldnt ask anything better Weve been in things like this before
Tom and well go in againand win Ill help you all I can Now
lets see if we can pick up any other clues This is like old times
and Ned laughed for he like Tom enjoyed a good fight and one in
which the odds were against them

We sure will have our hands full declared the young inventor
Trying to solve the problem of carrying guns on an aerial warship and
finding out who set this fire

Then youre not going to give up your aerial warship idea

No indeed Tom cried What made you think that

Well the way your father spoke

Oh dear old dad exclaimed Tom affectionately I dont want to
argue with him but hes dead wrong

Then you are going to make a go of it

I sure am Ned All I have to solve is the recoil proposition and as
soon as we get straightened out from this fire well tackle that
problem againyou and I But I sure would like to know who put this in
my red shed and Tom looked in a puzzled manner at the empty fire bomb
he still held

Tom paused on his way to the house to put the bomb in one of his
offices

No use letting dad know about this he went on It would only be
something else for him to worry about

Thats right agreed Ned

By this time nearly all evidences of the fire except for the blackened
ruins of the shed had been cleared away High in the air hung a cloud
of black smoke caused by some chemicals that had burned harmlessly
save for that pall Tom Swift had indeed had a lucky escape

The young inventor finding his father quieted down and conversing
easily with Mr Damon who was blessing everything he could think of
motioned to Ned to follow him out of the house again

Well leave dad here said Tom and do a little investigating on our
own account Well look for clues while theyre fresh

But it must be confessed after Tom and Ned had spent the rest of that
day in and about the burned shed they were little wiser than when they
started They found the place where the fire bomb had evidently been
placed right inside the main entrance to the shed Tom knew it had
been there because there were peculiar marks on the charred wood and a
certain queer smell of chemicals that confirmed his belief

They put the bomb there to prevent anyone going in at the first alarm
and saving anything Tom said They didnt count on the roof burning
through first giving me a chance to use the sand I made the roof of
the red shed flimsy just on that account so the force of the explosion
if one ever came would be mostly upward You know the expanding gases
caused by an explosion or by rapid combustion always do just as
electricity does seek the shortest and easiest route In this case I
made the roof the easiest route

A lucky provision observed Ned

That night Tom had to confess himself beaten as far as finding clues
was concerned The empty fire bomb was the only one and that seemed
valueless

Close questioning of the workmen failed to disclose anything Tom was
particularly anxious to discover if any mysterious strangers had been
seen about the works There was a strict rule about admitting them to
the plant however and it could not be learned that this had been
violated

Well well just have to lay that aside for a while Tom said the
next day when Ned again came to pay a visit Now what do you say to
tackling with me that recoil problem on the aerial warship

Im ready if you are Ned agreed though I know about as much of
those things as a snake does about dancing But Im game

The two friends walked out toward the shed where Toms new craft was
housed As yet Ned had not seen it On the way they saw Eradicate
walking along talking to himself as he often did

I wonder what he has on his mind remarked Ned musingly

Something does seem to be worrying him agreed Tom

As they neared the colored man they could hear him saying

He suah did hab nerve dats what he did De idea ob askin me all dem
questions an den wantin t know if Id sell him

Whats that Eradicate asked Tom

Oh its a man I met when I were comin back from de ash dump
Eradicate explained One of the colored mans duties was to cart ashes
away from Toms various shops and dump them in a certain swampy lot
With an old ramshackle cart and his mule Boomerang Eradicate did
this task to perfection

A manwhat sort of a man asked Tom always ready to be suspicious
of anything unusual

He were a queer man went on the aged colored helper First he
stopped me an asted me fo a ride He was a dressedup genman too
an I were suah sprised at him wantin t set in mah ole ash cart
said Eradicate But I done was polite t him an fixed a blanket sos
he wouldnt git too dirty Den he asted me ef I didnt wuk fo yo
Massa Tom an of course I says as how I did Den he asted me about de
fire an how much damage it done an how we put it out An he end up
by sayin hed laik t buy mah mule Boomerang an he wants t come
heah dis arternoon an talk t me about it

He does eh cried Tom What sort of a man was he Rad

Well a genman sort ob man Massa Tom Stranger t me I nebber seed
him afo He suah was monstrous polite t ole black Eradicate an he
gib me a halfdollar too jest fo a little ride But I aint gwine t
sell Boomerang no indeedy I aint and Eradicate shook his gray
kinky head decidedly

Ned there may be something in this said Tom in an excited whisper
to his chum I dont like the idea of a mysterious stranger
questioning Eradicate




CHAPTER VI

THE AERIAL WARSHIP


Ned Newton looked at Tom questioningly Then he glanced at the
unsuspicious colored man who was industriously polishing the
halfdollar the mysterious stranger had given him

Rad just exactly what sort of a man was this one you speak of asked
Tom

Why he were a genman

Yes I know that much Youve said it before But was he an
Englishman an Americanor

Tom paused and waited for an answer

I think he were a Frenchman spoke Eradicate I done didnt see him
eat no frogs laigs but he smoked a cigarette dat had a funny smell
and he suah was monstrous polite He suah was a Frenchman I think

Tom and Ned laughed at Eradicates description of the man but Toms
face was soon grave again

Tell us more about him Rad he suggested Did he seem especially
interested in the fire

No sah Massa Tom he seemed laik he was more special interested in
mah mule Boomerang He done asted how long I had him an how much I
wanted fo him an how old he was

But every once in a while he put in some question about the fire or
about our shops didnt he Rad Tom wanted to know

The colored man scratched his kinky head and glanced with a queer look
at Tom

How yo all done guess dat he asked

Answer my question insisted Tom

Yes sah he done did ask about yo and de wuks ebery now and den
Rad confessed But how yo all knowed dat Massa Tom when I were
atellin yo all about him astin fo mah mule done gets medats
what it suah does

Never mind Rad He asked questions about the plant thats all I want
to know But you didnt tell him much did you

Eradicate looked reproachfully at his master

Yo all done knows me bettah dan dat Massa Tom the old colored man
said Yo all know yo done gib orders fo nobody t talk about yo
projections

Yes I know I gave those orders Tom said with a smile but I want
to make sure that they have been followed

Well I done follered em Massa Tom

Then you didnt tell this queer stranger Frenchman or whatever he
is much about my place

I didnt tell him nuffin sah I done frowed dust in his eyes

Ned uttered an exclamation of surprise

Eradicate is speaking figuratively Tom said with a laugh

Dats what I means the colored man went on I done fooled him When
he asted me about de fire I said it didnt do no damage at allin fack
dat wed rather hab de fire dan not hab it case it done gib us a
chance t practice our hose drill

Thats good laughed Tom What else

Well he done sort ob hinted t me ef we all knowed how de fire done
start I says as how we did dat we done start it ourseves fo
practice an dat we done expected it all along an were ready fo it
Course I knows dat were a sort of fairy story Massa Tom but den dat
cigarettesmokin Frenchman didnt hab no right t asted me so many
questions did he

No indeed Rad And Im glad you didnt give him straight answers So
hes coming here later on is he

T see ef I wants t sell mah mule Boomerang yais sah I sort ob
thought maybe youd want t hab a look at dat man so I tole him t
come on Course I doant want t sell Boomerang but ef he was t offer
me a big lot ob money fo him Id take it

Of course Tom answered Very well Rad You may go on now and
dont say anything to anyone about what you have told me

I wont Massa Tom promised the colored man as he went off
muttering to himself

Well what do you make of it Tom asked Ned of his chum as they
walked on toward the shed of the new big aerial warship

I dont know just what to think Ned Of course things like this have
happened beforepersons trying to worm secrets out of Eradicate or
some of the other men

They never succeeded in getting much Im glad to say but it always
keeps me worried for fear something will happen Tom concluded

But about this Frenchman

Well he must be a new one And now I come to think of it I did hear
some of the men speaking about a foreignera strangerbeing around
town last week It was just a casual reference and I paid little
attention to it Now it looks as though there might be something in it

Do you think hell come to bargain with Eradicate about the mule Ned
asked

Hardly That was only talk to make Eradicate unsuspicious The
stranger whoever he was sized Rad up partly right I surmised when
Rad said he asked a lot of questions about the mule that was only to
divert suspicion and that hed come back to the subject of the fire
every chance he got

And you were right

Yes so it seems But I dont believe the fellow will come around
here It would be too risky All the same well be prepared for him
Ill just rig up one of my phototelephone machines so that if he
does come to have a talk with Rad we can both see and hear him

Thats great Tom But do you think this fellow had anything to do
with the fire

I dont know He knew about it of course This isnt the first fire
weve had in the works and though we always fight them ourselves
still news of it will leak out to the town So he could easily have
known about it And he might be in with those who set it for I firmly
believe the fire was set by someone who has an object in injuring me

Its too bad declared Ned Seems as though they might let you
alone if they havent gumption enough to invent things for themselves

Well dont worry Maybe it will come out all right returned Tom
Now lets go and have a look at my aerial warship I havent shown it
to you yet Then well get ready for that mysterious Frenchman if he
comesbut I dont believe he will

The young inventor unlocked the door of the shed where he kept his
latest pet and at the sight which met his eyes Ned Newton uttered an
exclamation of surprise

Tom what is it he cried in an awed voice

My aerial warship was the quiet answer

Ned Newton gave vent to a long whistle and then began a detailed
examination of the wonderful craft he saw before him That is he made
as detailed an examination as was possible under the circumstances for
it was a long time before the young bank clerk fully appreciated all
Tom Swift had accomplished in building the Mars which was the warlike
name painted in red letters on the big gas container that tugged and
swayed overhead

Tom however did you do it gasped Ned at length

By hard work was the modest reply Ive been at this for a longer
time than youd suppose working on it at odd moments I had a lot of
help too or I never could have done it And now it is nearly all
finished as far as the ship itself is concerned The only thing that
bothers me is to provide for the recoil of the guns I want to carry
Maybe you can help me with that Come on now Ill explain how the
affair works and what I hope to accomplish with it

In brief Toms aerial warship was a sort of German Zeppelin type of
dirigible balloon rising in the air by means of a gas container or
rather several of them for the section for holding the lifting gas
element was divided by bulkheads

The chief difference between dirigible balloons and ordinary
aeroplanes as you all know is that the former are lifted from the
earth by a gas such as hydrogen which is lighter than air while the
aeroplane lifts itself by getting into motion when broad flat planes
or surfaces hold it up just as a flat stone is held up when you sail
it through the air The moment the stone or aeroplane loses its
forward motion it begins to fall

This is not so with a dirigible balloon It is held in the air by means
of the lifting gas and once so in the air can be sent in any direction
by means of propellers and rudders

Toms aerial warship contained many new features While it was as large
as some of the wartype Zeppelins it differed from them materially
But the details would be of more interest to a scientific builder of
such things than to the ordinary reader so I will not weary you with
them

Sufficient to say that Toms craft consisted first of a great
semirigid bag or envelope made of specially prepared oiled silk and
aluminum to hold the gas which was manufactured on board There were
a number of gastight compartments so that if one or even if a number
of them burst or were shot by an enemy the craft would still remain
afloat

Below the big gas bag was the ship proper a light but strong and rigid
framework about which were built enclosed cabins These cabins or
compartments housed the driving machinery the gasgenerating plant
living sleeping and dining quarters and a pilothouse whence the
ship could be controlled

But this was not all

Ned making a tour of the Mars as she swayed gently in the big shed
saw where several aluminum pedestals were mounted fore and aft and on
either beam of the ship

They look just like places where you intend to mount guns said Ned
to Tom

And thats exactly what they are the young inventor replied I
have the guns nearly ready for mounting but I cant seem to think of a
way of providing for the recoil And if I dont take care of that Im
likely to find my ship coming apart under me after we bombard the
enemy with a broadside or two

Then you intend to fight with this ship asked Ned

Well no not exactly personally I was thinking of offering it to the
United States Government Foreign nations are getting ready large
fleets of aerial warships so why shouldnt we Matters in Europe are
mighty uncertain There may be a great war there in which aerial craft
will play a big part I am conceited enough to think I can build one
that will measure up to the foreign ones and Ill soon be in a
position to know

What do you mean

I mean I have already communicated with our government experts and
they are soon to come and inspect this craft I have sent them word
that it is about finished There is only the matter of the guns and
some of the ordnance officers may be able to help me out with a
suggestion for I admit I am stuck exclaimed Tom

Then youre going to do the same with this aerial warship as you did
with your big lantern and that immense gun you perfected asked Ned

Thats right confirmed Tom My former readers will know to what Ned
Newton referred and those of you who do not may learn the details of
how Tom helped Uncle Sam by reading the previous volumes Tom Swift
and His Great Searchlight and Tom Swift and His Giant Cannon

When do you expect the government experts Ned asked

Within a few days now But Ill have to hustle to get ready for them
as this fire has put me back There are quite a number of details I
need to change Well now let me explain about that gun recoil
business Maybe you can help me

Fire away laughed Ned Ill do the best I can

Tom led the way from the main shed where the aerial warship was
housed to a small private office As Ned entered the door pulled by
a strong spring swung after him He held back his hand to prevent it
from slamming but there was no need for a patent arrangement took up
all the force and the door closed gently Ned looked around not much
surprised for the same sort of doorcheck was in use at his bank But
a sudden idea came to him

There you are Tom he cried Why not take up the recoil of the guns
on your aerial warship by some such device as that and Ned pointed to
the doorcheck




CHAPTER VII

WARNINGS


For a moment or two Tom Swift did not seem to comprehend what Ned had
said He remained staring first at his chum who stood pointing and
from him Toms gaze wandered to the top of the door It may have been
and probably was that Tom was thinking of other matters at that
instant But Ned said again

Wouldnt that do Tom Check the recoil of the gun with whatever stuff
is in that arrangement

A sudden change came over Toms face It was lighted up with a gleam of
understanding

By Jove Ned old man he cried I believe youve struck it And to
think that has been under my nose or rather over my head all this
while and I never thought of it Hurray That will solve the problem

Do you think it will asked Ned glad that he had contributed
something if only an idea to Toms aerial warship

Im almost sure it will Ill give it a trial right away

Whats in that doorcheck Ned asked I never stopped before to
think what useful things they are though at the bank with the big
heavy doors they are mighty useful

They are a combination of springs and hydrostatic valves began Tom

Goodnight laughed Ned Excuse the slang Tom but what in the
world is a hydrostatic valve

A valve through which liquids pass In this doorcheck there may be a
mixture of water alcohol and glycerine the alcohol to prevent
freezing in cold weather and the glycerine to give body to the mixture
so it will not flow through the valves too freely

And do you think you can put something like that on your guns so the
recoil will be taken up Ned wanted to know

I think so spoke Tom Im going to work on it right away and well
soon see how it will turn out Its mighty lucky you thought of that
for I sure was up against it as the boys say

It just seemed to come to me spoke Ned seeing how easily the door
closed

If the thing works Ill give you due credit for it promised Tom
Now Ive got to figure out how much force a modified hydrostatic
valve check like that will take up and how much recoil my biggest gun
will have

Then youre going to put several guns on the Mars asked Ned

Yes four quickfirers at least two on each side and heavier guns
at the bow and stern to throw explosive shells in a horizontal or
upward direction For a downward direction we wont need any guns we
can simply drop the bombs or shells from a release clutch

Drop them on other air craft Ned wanted to know

Well if its necessary yes Though I guess there wont be much
chance of doing that to a rival aeroplane or dirigible But in flying
over cities or forts explosive bombs can be dropped very nicely For
use in attacking other air craft I am going to depend on my lateral
fire from the guns mounted on either beam and in the bow and stern

You speak as though you yourself were going into a battle of the
air said Ned

No I dont believe Ill go that far Tom replied Though if the
government wants my craft I may have to go aloft and fire shots at
targets for them to show them how things work

Please dont think that I am in favor of war Ned went on Tom
earnestly I hate it and I wish the time would come when all nations
would disarm But if the other countries are laying themselves out to
have aerial battleships it is time the United States did also We must
not be left behind especially in view of what is taking place in
Europe

I suppose thats right agreed Ned Have you any of your guns ready

Yes all but the mounting of them on the supports aboard the Mars I
havent dared do that yet and fire them until I provided some means
of taking up the recoil Now Im going to get right to work on that
problem

There was considerable detailed figuring and computation work ahead of
Tom Swift and I will not weary you by going into the details of higher
mathematics Even Ned lost interest after the start of the problem
though he was interested when Tom took down the doorcheck and began
measuring the amount of force it would take up computing it on scales
and spring balances

Once this had been done and Tom had figured just how much force could
be expected to be taken up by a larger check with stronger hydrostatic
valves the young inventor explained

And now to see how much recoil force my guns develop

Are you really going to fire the guns asked Ned

Surely answered Tom Thats the only way to get at real results
Ill have the guns taken out and mounted in a big field Then well
fire them and measure the recoil

Well that may be some fun spoke Ned with a grin More fun than
all these figures and he looked at the mass of details on Toms desk

This was the second or third day after the fire in the red shed and in
the interim Tom had been busy making computations These were about
finished Meanwhile further investigation had been made of clues
leading to the origin of the blaze in the shed but nothing had been
learned

A phototelephone had been installed near Eradicates quarters in the
hope that the mysterious stranger might keep his promise and come to
see about the mule In that case something would have been learned
about him But as Tom feared the man did not appear

Ned was much interested in the guns and a little later he helped Tom
and Koku mount them in a vacant lot The giants strength came in handy
in handling the big parts

Mr Swift strolled past as the guns were being mounted for the
preliminary test and inquired what his son was doing

It will never work Tom never declared the aged inventor when
informed You cant take up those guns in your air craft and fire
them with any degree of safety

You wait Dad laughed Tom You havent yet seen how the Newton
hydrostatic recoil operates

Ned smiled with pleasure at this

It took nearly a week to get all the guns mounted for some of them
required considerable work and it was also necessary to attach gauges
to them to register the recoil and pressure In the meanwhile Tom had
been in further communication with government experts who were soon to
call on him to inspect the aerial warship with a view to purchase

When are they coming asked Ned as he and Tom went out one morning
to make the first test of the guns

They will be here any day now They didnt set any definite date I
suppose they want to take us unawares to see that I dont frameup
any game on them Well Ill be ready any time they come Now Koku
bring along those shells and dont drop any of them for that new
powder is freakish stuff

Me no drop any Master spoke the giant as he lifted the boxes of
explosives in his strong arms

The largest gun was loaded and aimed at a distant hill for Tom knew
that if the recoil apparatus would take care of the excess force of his
largest gun the problem of the smaller ones would be easy to solve

Here Rad where are you going Tom asked as he noticed the colored
man walking away after having completed a task assigned to him

Wheres I gwine Massa Tom

Yes Rad thats what I asked you

IIse gwine t feed mah mule Boomerang said the colored man
slowly Its his eatin time jest now Massa Tom

Nonsense It isnt anywhere near noon yet

Yais sab Massa Tom I knows dat said Eradicate as he carefully
edged away from the big gun but Ise done changed de eatin hours ob
dat mule He had a little touch ob indigestion de udder day an Ise
feedin him diffrent now So I guess as how yoll hab t scuse me
now Massa Tom

Oh well trot along laughed the young inventor I guess we wont
need you Is everything all right there Koku

All right Master

Now Ned if youll stand here went on Tom and note the extreme
point to which the hand on the pressure gauge goes Ill be obliged to
you Just jot it down on this pad

Here comes someone remarked the bank clerk as he saw that his
pencil was sharpened He pointed to the field back of them

Its Mr Damon observed Tom Well wait until he arrives Hell be
interested in this

Bless my collar button Tom Whats going on asked the eccentric
man as he came up Has war been declared

Just practicing replied the young inventor Getting ready to put
the armament on my aerial warship

Well as long as Im behind the guns Im all right I suppose

Perfectly Tom replied Now then Ned I think well fire

There was a moment of inspection to see that nothing had been
forgotten and then the big gun was discharged There was a loud
report not as heavy though as Ned had expected but there was no
puff of smoke for Tom was using smokeless powder Only a little flash
of flame was observed

Catch the figure Ned Tom cried

I have it was the answer Eighty thousand

Good And I can build a recoil check that will take up to one hundred
and twenty thousand pounds pressure That ought to be margin of safety
enough Now well try another shot

The echoes of the first had hardly died away before the second gun was
ready for the test That too was satisfactory and then the smaller
ones were operated These were not quite so satisfactory as the recoil
developed was larger in proportion to their size than Tom had figured

But I can easily put a larger hydrostatic check on them he said
Now well fire by batteries and see what the total is

Then began a perfect bombardment of the distant hillside service
charges being used and explosive shells sent out so that dirt
stones and gravel flew in all directions Danger signs and flags had
been posted and a cordon of Toms men kept spectators away from the
hill so no one would be in the danger zone

The young inventor was busy making some calculations after the last of
the firing had been completed Koku was packing up the unfired shells
and Mr Damon was blessing his eardrums and the pieces of cotton he
had stuffed in to protect them when a tall erect man was observed
strolling over the fields in the direction of the guns

Somebodys coming Tom warned Ned

Yes and a stranger too observed Tom I wonder if that can be
Eradicates Frenchman

But a look at the strangers face disproved that surmise He had a
frank and pleasant countenance obviously American

I beg your pardon he began addressing everyone in general but I
am looking for Tom Swift I was told he was here

I am Tom Swift replied our hero

Ah Well I am Lieutenant Marbury with whom you had some
correspondence recently about

Oh yes Lieutenant Marbury of the United States Navy interrupted
Tom Im glad to see you he went on holding out his hand We are
just completing some tests with the guns You called I presume in
reference to my aerial warship

That is ityes Have you it ready for a trial flight

Well almost It can be made ready in a few hours You see I have
been delayed There was a fire in the plant

A fire exclaimed the officer in surprise How was that We heard
nothing of it in Washington

No I kept it rather quiet Tom explained We had reason to suspect
that it was a fire purposely set in a shed where I kept a quantity of
explosives

Ha exclaimed Lieutenant Marbury This fits in with what I have
heard And did you not receive warning he asked Tom

Warning No Of what

Of foreign spies was the unexpected answer I am sorry Some of
our Secret Service men unearthed something of a plot against you and I
presumed you had been told to watch out If you had the fire might not
have occurred There must have been some error in Washington But let
me tell you now Tom Swiftbe on your guard




CHAPTER VIII

A SUSPECTED PLOT


The officers words were so filled with meaning that Tom started Ned
Newton too showed the effect he felt

Do you really mean that asked the young inventor looking around to
make sure his father was not present On account of Professor Swifts
weak heart Tom wished to spare him all possible worry

I certainly do mean it insisted Lieutenant Marbury And while I am
rather amazed at the news of the fire for I did not think the plotters
would be so bold as that it is in line with what I expected and what
we suspected in Washington

And that waswhat asked Tom

The existence of a welllaid plot not only against our government
but against you

And why have they singled me out Tom demanded

I might as well tell it from the beginning the officer went on As
long as you have not received any official warning from Washington you
had better hear the whole story But are you sure you had no word

Well now I wont be so sure Tom confessed I have been working
very hard the last two days making some intricate calculations I
have rather neglected my mail to tell you the truth

And come to think of it there were several letters received with the
Washington postmark But I supposed they had to do with some of my
patents and I only casually glanced over them There was one letter
though that I couldnt make head or tail of

Ha That was it cried the lieutenant It was the warning in cipher
or code I didnt think they would neglect to send it to you

But what good would it do me if I couldnt read it asked Tom

You must also have received a method of deciphering the message the
officer said Probably you overlooked that The Secret Service men
sent you the warning in code so it would not be found out by the
plotters and to make sure you could understand it a method of
translating the cipher was sent in a separate envelope It is too bad
you missed it

Yes for I might have been on my guard agreed Tom The red shed
might not have burned but as it was only slight damage was done

Owing to the fact that Tom put the fire out with sand ballast from his
dirigible cried Ned You should have seen it

I should have liked to be here the lieutenant spoke But if I were
you Tom Swift I would take means to prevent a repetition of such
things

I shall Tom decided But if we want to talk we had better go to
my office where we can be more private I dont want the workmen to
hear too much

Now that the firing was over a number of Toms men from the shops had
assembled around the cannon Most of them the young inventor felt
could be trusted but in so large a gathering one could never be sure

Did you come on from Washington yesterday asked Tom as he Ned and
the officer strolled toward the shed where was housed the aerial
warship

Yes and I spent the night in New York I arrived in town a short time
ago and came right on out here At your house I was told you were over
in the fields conducting experiments so I came on here

Glad you did Tom said Ill soon have something to show you I
hope But I am interested in hearing the details of this suspected
plot Are you sure one exists

Perfectly sure was the answer We dont know all the details yet
nor who are concerned in it but we are working on the case The Secret
Service has several agents in the field

We are convinced in Washington went on Lieutenant Marbury when he
Tom and Ned were seated in the private office that foreign spies are
at work against you and against our government

Why against me asked Tom in wonder

Because of the inventions you have perfected and turned over to Uncle
Samnotably the giant cannon which rivals anything foreign European
powers have and the great searchlight which proved so effective
against the border smugglers The success of those two alone to say
nothing of your submarine has not only made foreign nations jealous
but they fear youand us the officer went on

Well if they only take it out in fear

But they wont interrupted the officerThey are seeking to destroy
those inventions More than once of late we have nipped a plot just
in time

Have they really tried to damage the big gun asked Tom referring to
one he had built and set up at Panama

They have And now this fire proves that they are taking other
measuresthey are working directly against you

Why I wonder

Either to prevent you from making further inventions or to stop you
from completing your latestthe aerial warship

But I didnt know the foreign governments knew about that Tom
exclaimed It was a secret

Few secrets are safe from foreign Spies declared Lieutenant Marbury
They have a great ferretingout system on the other side We are just
beginning to appreciate it But our own men have not been idle

Have they really learned anything Tom asked Nothing definite
enough to warrant us in acting was the answer of the government man
But we know enough to let us see that the plot is farreaching

Are the French in it asked Ned impulsively

The French Why do you ask that

Tell him about Eradicate and the man who wanted to buy the mule
Tom suggested Ned

Thereupon the young inventor mentioned the story told by Eradicate He
also brought out the firebomb and explained his theory as to how it
had operated to set the red shed ablaze

I think you are right said Lieutenant Marbury And as regards the
French I might say they are not the only nation banded to obtain our
secretsyours and the governments

But I thought the French and the English were friendly toward us Ned
exclaimed

So they are in a certain measure the officer went on And Russia
is too But in all foreign countries there are two parties the war
party as it might be called and the peace element

But I might add that it is neither France England nor Russia that we
must fear It is a certain other great nation which at present I will
not name

And you think spies set this fire

I certainly do

But what measures shall I adopt against this plot Tom asked

We will talk that over said Lieutenant Marbury But before I go
into details I want to give you another warning You must be very
careful about

A sudden knock on the door interrupted the speaker




CHAPTER IX

THE RECOIL CHECK


Who is that asked Ned Newton with a quick glance at his chum

I dont know Tom answered I left orders we werent to be disturbed
unless it was something important

May be something has happened suggested the navy officer another
fire perhaps or a

It isnt a fire Tom answered The automatic alarm would be ringing
before this in that case

The knock was repeated Tom went softly to the door and opened it
quickly to disclose standing in the corridor one of the messengers
employed about the shops

Well what is it asked Tom a bit sharply

Oh if you please Mr Swift said the boy a man has applied for
work at the main office and you know you left orders there that if any
machinists came along we were to

Oh so I did Tom exclaimed I had forgotten about that he went on
to Lieutenant Marbury and Ned I am in need of helpers to rush through
the finishing touches on my aerial warship and I left word if any
applied as they often do coming here from other cities that I wanted
to see them How many are there Tom asked of the messenger

Two this time They both say theyre good mechanics

Thats what they all say interposed Tom with a smile But though
they may be good mechanics in their own line they need to have special
qualifications to work on airships Tell them to wait Rodney Tom
went on to the lad and Ill see them presently

As the boy went away and Tom closed the door he turned to Lieutenant
Marbury

You were about to give me another warning when that interruption came
You might complete it now

Yes it was another warning spoke the officer and one I hope you
will heed It concerns yourself personally

Do you mean he is in danger asked Ned quickly

Thats exactly what I do mean was the prompt reply In danger of
personal injury if not something worse

Tom did not seem as alarmed as he might reasonably have been under the
circumstances

Danger eh he repeated coolly On the part of whom

Thats just where I cant warn you the officer replied I can only
give you that hint and beg of you to be careful

Do you mean you are not allowed to tell asked Ned

No indeed it isnt that the lieutenant hastened to assure the
young man I would gladly tell if I knew But this plot like the
other one directed against the inventions themselves is so shrouded
in mystery that I cannot get to the bottom of it

Our Secret Service men have been working on it for some time not only
in order to protect you because of what you have done for the
government but because Uncle Sam wishes to protect his own property
especially the searchlight and the big cannon But though our agents
have worked hard they have not been able to get any clues that would
put them on the right trail

So we can only warn you to be careful and this I do in all
earnestness That was part of my errand in coming here though of
course I am anxious to inspect the new aerial warship you have
constructed So watch out for two thingsyour inventions and more
than all your life

Do you really think they would do me bodily harm Tom asked a trifle
skeptical

I certainly do These foreign spies are desperate If they cannot
secure the use of these inventions to their own country they are
determined not to let this country have the benefit of them

Well Ill be careful Tom promised Im no more anxious than anyone
else to run my head into danger and I certainly dont want any of my
shops or inventions destroyed The fire in the red shed was as close as
I want anything to come

Thats right agreed Ned And if theres anything I can do Tom
dont hesitate to call on me

All right old man I wont forget And now perhaps you would like
to see the Mars he said to the lieutenant

I certainly would was the ready answer But hadnt you better see
those men who are waiting to find out about positions here

Theres no hurry about them Tom said We have applicants every day
and its earlier than the hour when I usually see them They can wait
Now I want your opinion on my new craft But you must remember that
it is not yet completed and only recently did I begin to solve the
problem of mounting the guns So be a little easy with your
criticisms

Followed by Ned and Lieutenant Marbury Tom led the way into the big
airship shed There swaying about at its moorings was the immense
aerial warship To Neds eyes it looked complete enough but when Tom
pointed out the various parts and explained to the government officer
how it was going to work Ned understood that considerable yet remained
to be done on it

Tom showed his official guest how a new system of elevation and
depressing rudders had been adopted how a new type of propeller was to
be used and indicated several other improvements The lower or cabin
part of the aircraft could be entered by mounting a short ladder from
the ground and Tom took Ned and Lieutenant Marbury through the
engineroom and other compartments of the Mars

It certainly is most complete the officer observed And when you
get the guns mounted I shall be glad to make an official test You
understand he went on to Tom that we are vitally interested in the
guns since we now have many aircraft that can be used purely for
scouting purposes What we want is something for offense a veritable
naval terror of the seas

I understand Tom answered And I am going to begin work on mounting
the guns at once I am going to use the Newton recoil check he added
Ned here is responsible for that

Is that so asked the lieutenant as Tom clapped his chum on the back

Yes thats his invention

Oh it isnt anything of the sort Ned objected I just

Yes he just happened to solve the problem for me interrupted Tom
as he told the story of the doorspring

A good idea commented Lieutenant Marbury

Tom then briefly described the principle on which his aerial warship
would work explaining how the lifting gas would raise it with its
load of crew guns and explosives high into the air how it could then
be sent ahead backward to either side or around in a circle by
means of the propellers and the rudders and how it could be raised or
lowered either by rudders or by forcing more gas into the lifting
bags or by letting some of the vapor out

And while this was being done by the pilot or captain in charge the
crew could be manning the guns with which hostile airships would be
attacked and bombs dropped on the forts or battleships of the enemy

It seems very complete observed the lieutenant I shall be glad
when I can give it an official test

Which ought to be in about a week Tom said Meanwhile I shall be
glad if you will be my guest here

And so that was arranged

Leaving Ned and the lieutenant to entertain each other Tom went to see
the mechanics who had applied for places He found them satisfactory
and engaged them One of them had worked for him before The other was
a stranger but he had been employed in a large aeroplane factory and
brought good recommendations

There followed busy days at the Swift plant and work was pushed on the
aerial warship The hardest task was the mounting of the guns and
equipping them with the recoil check without which it would be
impossible to fire them with the craft sailing through the air

But finally one of the big guns and two of the smaller ones were in
place with the apparatus designed to reduce the recoil shock and then
Tom decided to have a test of the Mars

Up in the air do you mean asked Ned who was spending all his spare
time with his chum

Well a little way up in the air at least Tom answered Ill make
a sort of captive balloon of my craft and see how she behaves I dont
want to take too many chances with that new recoil check though it
seems to work perfectly in theory

The day came when for the first time the Mars was to come out of the
big shed where she had been constructed The craft was not completed
for a flight as yet but could be made so in a few days with rush
work The roof of the great shed slid back and the big envelope
containing the buoyant gas rose slowly upward There was a cry of
surprise from the many workmen in the yard as they saw most of them
for the first time the wonderful new craft It did not go up very
high being held in place with anchor ropes

The sun glistened on the bright brass and nickel parts and glinted
from the gleaming barrels of the quickfiring guns

Thats enough Tom called to the men below who were paying out the
ropes from the windlasses Hold her there

Tom Ned Lieutenant Marbury and Mr Damon were aboard the captive Mars

Looking about to see that all was in readiness Tom gave orders to
load the guns blank charges being used of course

The recoil apparatus was in place and it now remained to see if it
would do the work for which it was designed

All ready asked the young inventor

Bless my accident insurance policy exclaimed Mr Damon Im as
ready as ever I shall be Tom Let em go

Hold fast cried Tom as he prepared to press the electrical switch
which would set off the guns Ned and Lieutenant Marbury stood near the
indicators to notice how much of the recoil would be neutralized by the
check apparatus

Here we go cried the young inventor and at the same moment from
down below on the ground came a warning cry

Dont shoot Massa Tom Dont shoot Mah mule Boomerang

But Eradicate had spoken too late Tom pressed the switch there was a
deafening crash a spurt of flame and then followed wild cries and
confused shouts while the echoes of the reports rolled about the hills
surrounding Shopton




CHAPTER X

THE NEW MEN


What was the matter down there

Was anyone hurt

Dont forget to look at those pressure gauges

Bless my ham sandwich

Thus came the cries from those aboard the captive Mars Ned Lieutenant
Marbury and Tom had called out in the order named And of course I
do not need to tell you what remark Mr Damon made Tom glanced toward
where Ned and the government man stood and saw that they had made
notes of the pressure recorded on the recoil checks directly after the
guns were fired Mr Damon blessing innumerable objects under his
breath was looking over the side of the rail to discover the cause of
the commotion and cries of warning from below

I dont believe it was anything serious Tom said the odd man No
one seems to be hurt Look at Eradicate suddenly exclaimed Ned

And his mule I guess thats what the trouble was Tom

They looked to where the young bank employee pointed and saw the old
colored man seated on the seat of his ramshackle wagon doing his best
to pull down to a walk the big galloping mule which was dragging the
vehicle around in a circle

Whoa dere Eradicate was shouting as he pulled on the lines Whoa
dere Dats jest laik yo Boomerang t run when dere aint no call
fo it nohow Ef I done wanted yo t git a move on yod lay down
side de road an go to sleep Whoa now

But the noise of the shots had evidently frightened the longeared
animal and he was in no mood for stopping now that he had once
started It was not until some of the workmen ran out from the group
where they had gathered to watch Toms test and got in front of
Boomerang that they succeeded in bringing him to a halt

Eradicate climbed slowly down from the seat and limped around until he
stood in front of his pet

Yoyore a nice one aint yo he demanded in sarcastic tones
Yo done enough runnin in a few minutes fo a week ob Sundays an
now I wont be able t git a move out ob ye Ise ashamed ob yo dats
what I is Puffickly ashamed ob yo Go long now an yo wont git
no oats dish yeah day No sah and highly indignant Eradicate led
the now slowlyambling mule off to the stable

I wont shoot again until you have him shut up Rad laughed Tom I
didnt know you were so close when I set off those guns

Dats all right Massa Tom was the reply I done called t you t
wait but yo didnt heah me I spects But it doant mattah now
Shoot all yo laik Boomerang wont run any mo dis week He done
runned his laigs off now Shoot away

But Tom was not quite ready to do this He wanted to see what effect
the first shots had had on his aerial warship and to learn whether or
not the newly devised recoil check had done what was expected of it

No more shooting right away called the young inventor I want to
see how we made out with the first round How did she check up Ned

Fine as far as I can tell

Yes indeed added Lieutenant Marbury The recoil was hardly
noticeable though of course with the full battery of guns in use it
might be more so

I hope not answered Tom I havent used the full strength of the
recoil check yet I can tune it up more and when I do and when I have
it attached to all the guns big and little I think well do the
trick But now for a harder test

The rest of that day was spent in trying out the guns firing them with
practice and service charges though none of the shells used contained
projectiles It would not have been possible to shoot these with the
Mars held in place in the midst of Toms factory buildings

Well is she a success Tom asked Ned when the experimenting was
over for the time being

I think I can say soyes was the answer with a questioning look at
the officer

Indeed it isa great success We must give the Newton shock absorber
due credit

Ned blushed with pleasure

It was only my suggestion he said Tom worked it all out

But I needed the suggestion to start with the young inventor replied

Of course something may develop when you take your craft high in the
air and discharge the guns there said the lieutenant In a
rarefied atmosphere the recoil check may not be as effective as at the
earths surface But in such case doubtless you can increase the
strength of the springs and the hydrostatic valves

Yes I counted on that Tom explained I shall have to work out that
formula though and be ready for it But on the whole I am pretty
well satisfied

And indeed you may well feel that way commented the government
official

The Mars was hauled back into the shed and the roof slid shut over the
craft Much yet remained to do on it but now that Tom was sure the
important item of armament was taken care of he could devote his
entire time to the finishing touches

As his plant was working on several other pieces of machinery some of
it for the United States Government and some designed for his own use
Tom found himself obliged to hire several new hands An advertisement
in a New York newspaper brought a large number of replies and for a
day or two Tom was kept busy sifting out the least desirable and
arranging to see those whose answers showed they knew something of the
business requirements

Meanwhile Lieutenant Marbury remained as Toms guest and was helpful
in making suggestions that would enable the young inventor to meet the
governments requirements

Id like also to get on the track of those spies who I am sure
wish to do you harm said the lieutenant but clues seem to be scarce
around here

They are indeed agreed Tom I guess the way in which we handled
that fire in the red shed sort of discouraged them

Lieutenant Marbury shook his head

Theyre not so easily discouraged as that he remarked And with
the situation in Europe growing more acute every day I am afraid some
of those foreigners will take desperate measures to gain their ends

What particular ends do you mean

Well I think they will either try to so injure you that you will not
be able to finish this aerial warship or they will damage the craft
itself steal your plans or damage some of your other inventions

But what object would they have in doing such a thing Tom wanted to
know How would that help France Germany or Russia to do me an
injury

They are seeking to strike at the United States through you was the
answer They dont want Uncle Sam to have such formidable weapons as
your great searchlight the giant cannon or this new warship of the
clouds

But why not as long as the United States does not intend to go to war
with any of the foreign nations Tom inquired

No it is true we do not intend to go to war with any of the
conflicting European nations admitted Lieutenant Marbury but you
have no idea how jealous each of those foreign nations is of all the
others Each one fears that the United States will cease to be neutral
and will aid one or the other

Oh so thats it exclaimed Tom

Yes each nation which may at a moments notice be drawn into a war
with one or more rival nations fears that we may throw in our lot with
its enemies

And to prevent that they want to destroy some of my inventions
asked Tom

Thats the way I believe it will work out So you must be careful
especially since you have taken on so many new men

Thats so agreed the young inventor I have had to engage more
strangers than ever before for I am anxious to get the Mars finished
and give it a good test And now that you have mentioned it there are
some of those men of whom I am a bit suspicious

Have they done anything to make you feel that way asked the
lieutenant

Well not exactly it is more their bearing and the manner in which
they go about the works I must keep my eye on them for it takes only
a few discontented men to spoil a whole shop full I will be on my
guard

And not only about your new airship and other inventions said the
officer but about yourself personally Will you do that

Yes though I dont imagine anything like that will happen

Well be on your guard at all events warned Lieutenant Marbury

As Tom had said he had been obliged to hire a number of new men Some
of these were machinists who had worked for him or his father on
previous occasions and when tasks were few had been dismissed to go
to other shops These men Tom felt sure could be relied upon

But there were a number of others from New York and other large
cities of whom Tom was not so sure

You have more foreigners than I ever knew you to hire before Tom
his father said to him one day coming back from a tour of the shops

Yes I have quite a number Tom admitted But they are all good
workmen They stood the test

Yes some of them are too good observed the older inventor I saw
one of them making up a small motor the other day and he was winding
the armature a new way I spoke to him about it and he tried to prove
that his way was an improvement on yours Why hed have had it
shortcircuited in no time if I hadnt stopped him

Is that so asked Tom That is news to me I must look into this

Are any of the new men employed on the Mars Mr Swift asked

No not yet but I shall have to shift some there from other work I
think in order to get finished on time

Well they will bear watching I think his father said

Why have you seen anythingdo you began the young man for Mr
Swift had not been told of the suspicions of the lieutenant

Oh it isnt anything special the older inventor went on Only I
wouldnt let a man I didnt know much about get too much knowledge of
my latest invention

I wont Dad Thanks for telling me This latest craft is sure going
to be a beauty

Then you think it will work Tom

Im sure of it Dad

Mr Swift shook his head in doubt




CHAPTER XI

A DAY OFF


Tom Swift pondered long and intently over what his father had said to
him He sat for several minutes in his private office after the aged
inventor had passed out reviewing in his mind the talk just finished

I wonder said Tom slowly if any of the new men could have obtained
work here for the purpose of furthering that plot the lieutenant
suspects I wonder if that could be true

And the more Tom thought of it the more he was convinced that such a
thing was at least possible

I must make a close inspection and weed out any suspicious
characters he decided though I need every man I have working now
to get the Mars finished in time Yes I must look into this

Tom had reached a point in his work where he could leave much to his
helpers He had several good foremen and with his father to take
general supervision over more important details the young inventor had
more time to himself Of course he did not lay too many burdens on his
fathers shoulders since Mr Swifts health was not of the best

But Toms latest idea the aerial warship was so well on toward
completion that his presence was not needed in that shop more than two
or three times a day

When Im not there Ill go about in the other shops and sort of size
up the situation he decided I may be able to get a line on some of
those plotters if there are any here

Lieutenant Marbury had departed for a time to look after some personal
matters but he was to return inside of a week when it was hoped to
give the aerial warship its first real test in flight and under some
of the conditions that it would meet with in actual warfare

As Tom was about to leave his office to put into effect his new
resolution to make a casual inspection of the other shops he met Koku
the giant coming in Kokus hands and face were black with oil and
machine filings

Well what have you been doing Tom wanted to know Did you have an
accident For Koku had no knowledge of machinery and could not even
be trusted to tighten up a simple nut by himself But if some one
stood near him and directed him how to apply his enormous strength
Koku could do more than several machines

No accident Master he replied I help man lift that hammerhammer
thing that pounds so It get stuck

What the hammer of the drop forger cried Tom Was that out of
order again

Him stuck explained Koku simply

There was an automatic triphammer in one of the shops used for
pounding out drop forgings and this hammer seemed to take especial
delight in getting out of order Very often it jammed or stuck as
Koku described it and if the hammer could not be forced back on the
channel or upright guideplates it meant that it must be taken apart
and valuable time lost Once Koku had been near when the hammer got out
of order and while the workmen were preparing to dismantle it the
giant seized the big block of steel and with a heave of his mighty
shoulders forced it back on the guides

And is that what you did this time asked Tom

Yes Master Me fix hammer Koku answered I get dirty I no care
Man say I no can fix I show him I can

What man said that

Man who run hammer Ha I lift him by one finger He say he no like to
work on hammer He want to work on airship I tell him I tell you
maybe you give him jobhe baby Koku can work hammer Me fix it when
it get stuck

Well maybe you know what youre talking about but I dont said
Tom with a pleasant smile at his big helper Come on Koku well go
see what it all means

Koku work hammer maybe asked the giant hope fully

Well Ill see half promised Tom If its going to get out of gear
all the while it might pay me to keep you at it so you could get it
back in place whenever it kicked up a fuss and so save time Ill see
about it

Koku led the way to the shop where the triphammer was installed It was
working perfectly now as Tom could tell by the thundering blows it
struck The man operating it looked up as Tom approached and at a
gesture from the young inventor shut off the power

Been having trouble here asked Tom noting that the workman was one
of the new hands he had hired

Yes sir a little was the respectful answer This hammer goes on a
strike every now and then and gets jammed Your giant there forced it
back into place which is more than I could do with a big bar for a
lever He sure has some muscle

Yes agreed Tom hes pretty strong But whats this you said about
wanting to give up this job and go on the airship construction

The man turned red under his coat of grime

I didnt intend him to repeat that to you Mr Swift he said I was
a little put out at the way this hammer worked I lose so much time at
it that I said Id like to be transferred to the airship department
Ive worked in one before But Im not making a kick he added quickly
Work is too scarce for that

I understand said Tom I have been thinking of making a change
Koku seems to like this hammer and knows how to get it in order once
it gets off the guides You say you have had experience in airship
construction

Yes sir Ive worked on the engines and on the planes

Know anything about dirigible balloons

Yes Ive worked on them too but the engineering part is my
specialty Im a little out of my element on a triphammer

I see Well perhaps Ill give you a trial Meanwhile you might break
Koku in on operating this machine If I transfer you Ill put him on
this hammer

Thank you Mr Swift Ill show him all I know about it Oh there
goes the hammer again he exclaimed for as he started it up as Tom
turned away the big piece of steel once more jammed on the
channelplates

Me fix exclaimed the giant eagerly anxious for a chance to exhibit
his great strength

Wait a minute exclaimed Tom I want to get a look at that machine

He inspected it carefully before he signaled for Koku to force the
hammer back into place But if Tom saw anything suspicious he said
nothing There was however a queer look on his face as he turned
aside and he murmured to himself as he walked away

So you want to be transferred to the airship department do you Well
well see about that Well see

Tom had more problems to solve than those of making an aerial warship
that would be acceptable to the United States Government

Ned Newton called on his chum that evening The two talked of many
things gradually veering around to the subject uppermost in Toms
mindhis new aircraft

Youre thinking too much of that Ned warned him Youre as bad as
the time you went for your first flight

I suppose I am admitted Tom But the success of the Mars means a
whole lot to me And thats something I nearly forgot Ive got to go
out to the shop now Want to come along Ned

Sure though I tell you that youre working too hardburning the
electric light at both ends

This is just something simple Tom said It wont take long

He went out followed by his chum

But this isnt the way to the airship shed objected the young bank
clerk as he noted in which direction Tom was leading him

I know it isnt Tom replied But I want to look at one of the
triphammers in the forge shop when none of the men is around Ive
been having a little trouble there

Trouble exclaimed his chum Has that plot Lieutenant Marbury spoke
of developed

Not exactly This is something else and Tom told of the trouble with
the big hammer

I had an idea the young inventor said that the man at the machine
let it get out of order purposely so Id change him I want to see if
my suspicions are correct

Tom carefully inspected the hammer by the light of a powerful portable
electric lamp Ned held

Ha There it is Tom suddenly exclaimed

Something wrong Ned inquired

Yes This is whats been throwing the hammer off the guides all the
while and Tom pulled out a small steel bolt that had been slipped
into an oil hole A certain amount of vibration he explained to Ned
would rattle the bolt out so that it would force the hammer to one
side throwing it off the channelplates and rendering it useless for
the time being

A foxy trick commented Tom No wonder the machine got out of kilter
so easily

Do you think it was done purposely

Well Im not going to say But Im going to watch that man He
wants to be transferred to the airship department He put this in the
hammer perhaps to have an excuse for a change Well Ill give it to
him

You dont mean that youd take a fellow like that and put him to work
on your new aerial warship do you Tom

Yes I think I will Ned You see I look at it this way I havent
any real proof against him now He could only laugh at me if I accused
him But youve heard the proverb about giving a calf rope enough and
hell hang himself havent you

I think I have

Well Im going to give this fellow a little rope Ill transfer him
as he asks and Ill keep a close watch on him

But wont it be risky

Perhaps but no more so than leaving him in here to work mischief If
he is hatching a plot the sooner its over with the better I shall
like it I dont like a shot to hang fire Im warned now and Ill be
ready for him I have a line on whom to suspect This is the first
clue and Tom held up the incriminating bolt

I think youre taking too big a risk Tom his chum said Why not
discharge the man

Because that might only smooth things over for a time If this plot is
being laid the sooner it comes to a head and breaks the better Have
it done short sharp and quick is my motto Yes Ill shift him in
the morning Oh but I wish it was all over and the Mars was accepted
by Uncle Sam and Tom put his hand to his head with a tired gesture

Say old man exclaimed Ned what you want is a day off and Im
going to see that you get it You need a little vacation

Perhaps I do assented Tom wearily

Then youll have it cried Ned Theres going to be a little picnic
tomorrow Why cant you go with Mary Nestor Shed like you to take
her Im sure Her cousin Helen Randall is on from New York and she
wants to go also

How do you know asked Tom quickly

Because she said so laughed Ned I was over to the house to call I
have met Helen before and I suggested that you and I would take the
two girls and have a day off Youll come wont you

Well I dont know spoke Tom slowly I ought to

Nonsense Give up work for one day urged Ned Come along Itll do
you goodget the cobwebs out of your head

All right Ill go assented Tom after a moments thought

The next day having instructed his father and the foremen to look well
to the various shops and having seen that the work on the new aerial
warship was progressing favorably Tom left for a days outing with his
chum and the two girls

The picnic was held in a grove that surrounded a small lake and after
luncheon the four friends went for a ride in a launch Tom hired They
went to the upper end of the lake in rather a pretty but lonesome
locality

Tom you look tired said Mary Im sure youve been working too
hard

Why Im not working any harder than usual Tom insisted

Yes he is too declared Ned and hes running more chances too

Chances repeated Mary

Oh thats all bosh laughed Tom Come on lets go ashore and walk

That suits me spoke Ned Helen and Mary assented and soon the four
young persons were strolling through the shady wood

After a bit the couples became separated and Tom found himself walking
beside Mary in a woodland path The girl glanced at her companions
face and ventured

A penny for your thoughts Tom

Theyre worth more than that he replied gallantly I was thinking
ofyou

Oh how nicely you say it she laughed But I know better Youre
puzzling over some problem Tell me what did Ned mean when he hinted
at danger Is there any Tom

None at all he assured her Its just a sort of notion

Mary made a sudden gesture of silence

Hark she whispered to Tom I heard someone mention your name then
Listen




CHAPTER XII

A NIGHT ALARM


Mary Nestor spoke with such earnestness and her action in catching
hold of Toms arm to enjoin silence was so pronounced that though he
had at first regarded the matter in the light of a joke he soon
thought otherwise He glanced from the girls face to the dense
underbrush on either side of the woodland path

What is it Mary he asked in a whisper

I dont just know I heard whispering and thought it was the rustling
of the leaves of the trees Then someone spoke your name quite loudly
Didnt you hear it

Tom shook his head in negation

It may be Ned and his friend he whispered his lips close to Marys
ear

I think not was her answer Listen there it is again

Distinctly then Tom heard from some opening in the screen of bushes
his own name spoken Did you hear it asked Mary barely forming the
words with her lips But Tom could read their motion

Yes he nodded Then motioning to Mary to remain where she was he
stepped forward taking care to tread only on grassy places where there
were no little twigs or branches to break and betray his presence He
was working his way toward the sound of the unseen voice

There was a sudden movement in the bushes just beyond the spot Tom was
making for He halted quickly and peered ahead Mary too was looking
on anxiously

Tom saw the forms of two men partially concealed by bushes walking
away from him The men took no pains to conceal their movements so Tom
was emboldened to advance with less caution He hurried to where he
could get a good view and at the sight of one of the men he uttered
an exclamation

What is it asked Mary who was now at his side She had seen that
Tom had thrown aside caution and she had come up to join him

That manI know him the young inventor exclaimed It is
Feldmanthe one who wanted to be changed from the triphammer to the
airship department But who is that with him

As Tom spoke the other turned and at the sight of his face Mary Nestor
said

He looks like a Frenchman with that little mustache and imperial

So he is exclaimed Tom in a hoarse whisper He must be the
Frenchman that Eradicate spoke about I wonder what this can mean I
didnt know Feldman had left the shop

You may know what youre talking about but I dont Tom said Mary
with a smile at her companion Are they friends of yours

Hardly spoke the young inventor dryly That one Feldman is one of
my workmen He had charge of a dropforge press and triphammer that

Spare me the details Tom interrupted Mary You know I dont
understand a thing about machinery The wireless you erected on
Earthquake Island was as much as I could comprehend

Well a triphammer isnt as complicated as that spoke Tom with a
laugh as he noticed that the two men were far enough away so they
could not hear him What I was going to say was that one of those men
works in our shops The other I dont know but I agree with you that
he does look like a Frenchman and old Eradicate had a meeting with a
man whom he described as being of that nationality

And you say they are not friends of yours

I have no reason to believe they are

Then they must be enemies exclaimed Mary with quick intuition Oh
Tom you will be careful wont you

Of course I will little girl he said a note of fondness creeping
into his voice as he covered the small hand with his own large one
But there is no danger

Then why were these men discussing you

I dont know that they were Mary

They mentioned your name

Well that may be Probably one of them Feldman who works for me
was speaking to his companion about the chance for a position My
father and I employ a number of men you know

Well I suppose it is all right Tom and I surely hope it is But
you will be careful wont you And you look more worried than you
used to Has anything gone wrong

Not a thing little girl Everything is going fine My new aerial
warship will soon make a trial flight and Id be pleased to have you
as a passenger

Would you really Tom

Of course Consider that you have the first invitation

Thats awfully nice of you But you do look worried Tom Has anything
troubled you

No not much Everything is going all right now We did have a little
trouble at a fire in one of my buildings

A fire Oh Tom You never told me

Well it didnt amount to muchthe only suspicious fact about it was
that it seemed to have been of incendiary origin

Mary seemed much alarmed and again begged Tom to be on his guard
which he promised to do Had Mary known the warnings uttered by
Lieutenant Marbury she might have had more occasion for worry

Do you suppose that hammer man of yours came to these woods to meet
that Frenchman and talk about you Tom asked his companion when the
two men had strolled out of sight and the young people were on their
way back to the launch

Well its possible I have been warned that foreign spies are trying
to get hold of some of my patents and also to hamper the government in
the use of some others I have sold But theyll have their own troubles
to get away with anything The works are pretty well guarded and you
forget I have the giant Koku who is almost a personal bodyguard

Yes but he cant be everywhere at once Oh you will be careful
wont you Tom

Yes Mary I will promised the young inventor But dont say
anything to Ned about what we just saw and heard

Why not

Because hes been at me to hire a couple of detectives to watch over
me and this would give him another excuse Just dont say anything
and Ill adopt all the precautions I think are needful

I will on condition that you do that

And I promise I will

With that Mary had to be content A little later they joined Ned and
his friend and soon they were moving swiftly down the lake in the
launch

Well hasnt it done you good to take a day off Ned demanded of his
chum when they were on their homeward way

Yes I think it has agreed Tom

You swung your thoughts into a new channel didnt you

Oh yes I found something new to think about admitted the young
inventor with a quick look at Mary

But though Tom thus passed off lightly the little incident of the day
he gave it serious thought when he was alone

Those fellows were certainly talking about me he reasoned I
wonder what for And Feldman left the shop without my knowledge Ill
have to look into that I wonder if that Frenchy looking chap I saw was
the one who tried to pump Eradicate Another point to settle

The last was easily disposed of for on reaching his shops that
afternoon Tom crossquestioned the colored man and obtained a most
accurate description of the odd foreigner It tallied in every detail
with the man Tom had seen in the woods

And now about Feldman mused Tom as he went to the foreman of the
shop where the suspected man had been employed

Yes Feldman asked for a day off the foreman said in response to
Toms question He claimed his mother was sick and he wanted to go to
see her I knew you wouldnt object as we were not rushed in his
department

Oh thats all right said Tom quickly Did he say where his mother
lived

Over Lafayette way

Humph murmured Tom To himself he added Queer that he should be
near Lake Loraine in an opposite direction from Lafayette This will
bear an investigation

The next day Tom made it his business to pass near the hammer that was
so frequently out of order He found Feldman busy instructing Koku in
its operation Tom resolved on a little strategy

How is it working Feldman he asked

Very well Mr Swift There doesnt seem to be any trouble at all but
it may happen any minute Koku seems to take to it like a duck to
water

Well when he is ready to assume charge let me know

And then am I to go into the aeroplane shop

Ill see By the way how is your mother he asked quickly looking
Feldman full in the face

She is much better I took a day off yesterday to go to see her the
man replied quietly enough and without sign of embarrassment

Thats good Let me see she lives over near Lake Loraine doesnt
she

This time Feldman could not repress a start But he covered it
admirably by stooping over to pick up a tool that fell to the floor

No my mother is in Lafayette he said I dont know where Lake
Loraine is

Oh said Tom as he turned aside to hide a smile He was sure now he
knew at least one of the plotters

But Tom was not yet ready to show his hand He wanted better evidence
than any he yet possessed It would take a little more time

Work on the aerial warship was rushed and it seemed likely that a
trial flight could be made before the date set Lieutenant Marbury sent
word that he would be on hand when needed and in some of the shops
where fittings for the Mars were being made night and day shifts were
working

Well if everything goes well well take her for a trial flight
tomorrow said Tom coming in from the shops one evening

Guns and all asked Ned who had come over to pay his chum a visit
Mr Damon was also on hand invoking occasional blessings

Guns and all replied Tom

Ned had a little vacation from the bank and was to stay all night as
was Mr Damon

What time it was save that it must be near midnight Tom could not
tell but he was suddenly awakened by hearing yells from Eradicate

Massa Tom Massa Tom yelled the excited colored man Git up Git
up Suffin turrible am happenin in de balloon shop Hurry An yo
stan still Boomerang or Ill twist yo tail dats what I will
Hurry Massa Tom

Tom leaped out of bed




CHAPTER XIII

THE CAPTURE


Tom Swift was something like a fireman He had lived so long in an
atmosphere of constant alarms and danger that he was always ready for
almost any emergency His room was equipped with the end in view that
he could act promptly and effectively

So when he heard Eradicates alarm though he wondered what the old
colored man was doing out of bed at that hour Tom did not stop to
reason out that puzzle He acted quickly

His first care was to throw on the main switch connected with a big
storage battery and to which were attached the wires of the lighting
system This at once illuminated every shop in the plant and also the
grounds themselves Tom wanted to see what was going on The use of a
storage battery eliminated the running of the dynamo all night

And once he had done this Tom began pulling on some clothes and a pair
of shoes At the same time he reached out with one hand and pressed a
button that sounded an alarm in the sleeping quarters of Koku the
giant and in the rooms of some of the older and most trusted men

All this while Eradicate was shouting away down in the yard

Massa Tom Massa Tom he called Hurry Hurry Dey is killin Koku

Killing Koku exclaimed Tom as he finished his hasty dressing Then
my giant must already be in the fracas I wonder what its all about
anyhow

Whats up Tom came Neds voice from the adjoining room I thought
I heard a noise

Your thoughts do you credit Ned Tom answered If you listen right
close youll hear several noises

By Jove Youre right old man

Tom could hear his chum bound out of bed to the floor and at the same
time from the big shed where Tom was building his aerial warship came
a series of yells and shouts

Thats Kokus voice Tom exclaimed as he recognized the tones of the
giant

Im coming Tom Ned informed his chum Wait a minute

No time to wait Tom replied buttoning his coat as he sped down the
hall

Oh Tom what is it asked Mrs Baggert the housekeeper looking
from her room

I dont know But dont let dad get excited no matter what happens
Just put him off until I come back I think it isnt anything serious

Mr Damon who roomed next to Ned came out of his own apartment
partially dressed

Bless my suspenders he cried to Tom those articles just then
dangling over his hips What is it What has happened Bless my steam
gauge dont tell me its a fire

I think it isnt that Tom answered No alarm has rung Koku seems
to be in trouble

Well hes big enough to look after himself thats one consolation
chuckled Mr Damon Ill be right with you

By this time Ned had run out into the hall and together he and Tom
sped down the corridor They could not hear the shouts of Eradicate so
plainly now as he was on the other side of the house

But when the two young men reached the front porch they could hear the
yells given with redoubled vigor And in the glare of the electric
lights Tom saw Eradicate leading along Boomerang the old mule

What is it Rad What is it demanded the young inventor breathlessly

Trouble Massa Tom Dats what it am Trouble

I know thatbut what kind

De worstest kind I spects Massa Tom Listen to it

From the interior of the big shed not far from the house Tom and Ned
heard a confused jumble of shouts cries and pleadings mingled with
the rattle of pieces of metal and the banging of bits of wood And
above all that like the bellowing of a bull was noted the rumbling
voice of Koku the giant

Come on Ned Tom cried

Its suah trouble all right went on Eradicate Mah mule
Boomerang had a touch ob de colic an I got up t gib him some hot
drops an walk him around when I heard de mostest terrific
racketsound and den I spected trouble was comm

It isnt comingits here called Tom as he sped toward the big
shop Ned was but a step behind him The big workshop where the aerial
warship was being built was like the other buildings brilliantly
illuminated by the lights Tom had switched on The young inventor also
saw several of his employees speeding toward the same point

Tom was the first to reach the small door of the shed This was built
in one of the two large main doors which could be swung open when it
was desired to slide the Mars in from the ground and not admit it
through the roof

Look cried Tom pointing

Ned looked over his chums shoulder and saw the giant Koku struggling
with four menpowerful men they were too and they seemed bent on
mischief

For they came at Koku from four sides seeking to hold his hands and
feet so that he could not fight them back On the floor near where the
struggle was taking place was a coil of rope and it was evident that
it had been the intention of the men to overcome Koku and truss him up
so that he would not interfere with what they intended to do But Koku
was a match for even the four men powerful as they were

Were here Koku cried Tom Watch for an opening Ned he called
to his chum

The sound of Toms voice disconcerted at least two of the attackers
for they looked around quickly and this was fatal to their chances

Though such a big man Koku was exceptionally quick and no sooner did
he see his advantage as two of the men turned their gaze away from
him than he seized it

Suddenly tearing loose his hands from the grip of the two men who had
looked around Koku shot out his right and left fists and secured good
hold on the necks of two of his enemies The other two at his back
were endeavoring to pull him over but the giants sturdy legs still
held

So big was Kokus hands that they almost encircled the necks of his
antagonists Then happened a curious thing

With a shout that might have done credit to some ancient cavedweller
of the stone age Koku spread out his mighty arms and held apart the
two men he had grasped In vain they struggled to free themselves from
that terrible grip Their faces turned purple and their eyes bulged
out

Hes choking them to death shouted Ned

But Koku was not needlessly cruel

A moment later with a quick and sudden motion he bent his arms
bringing toward each other the two men he held as captives Their
heads came together with a dull thud and a second later Koku allowed
two limp bodies to slip from his grip to the floor

Hes done for them Tom cried Knocked them unconscious Good for
you Koku

The giant grunted and then with a quick motion slung himself around
hoping to bring the enemies at his back within reach of his powerful
arms But there was no need of this

As soon as the other two ruffians had seen their companions fall to the
floor of the shop they turned and fled leaping from an open window

There they go cried Ned

Some of the other men can chase them said the young inventor Well
tie up the two Koku has captured

As he approached nearer to the unconscious captives Tom uttered a cry
of surprise for he recognized them as two of the new men he had
employed

What can this mean he asked wonderingly

He glanced toward the window through which the two men had jumped to
escape and he was just in time to see one of them run past the open
door The face of this one was under a powerful electric light and Tom
at once recognized the man as Feldman the worker who had had so much
trouble with the triphammer

This sure is a puzzle marveled Tom My own men in the plot But
why did they attack Koku

The giant bending over the men he had knocked unconscious by beating
their heads together seemed little worse for the attack

We tie em up he said grimly as he brought over the rope that had
been intended for himself




CHAPTER XIV

THE FIRST FLIGHT


Little time was lost in securing the two men who had been so
effectively rendered helpless by Kokus ready if rough measures One
of them was showing signs of returning consciousness now and Tom not
willing to inflict needless pain even on an enemy told one of his
men summoned by the alarm to bring water Soon the two men opened
their eyes and looked about them in dazed fashion

Diddid anything hit me asked one meekly

It must have been a thunderbolt spoke the other dreamily But it
didnt look like a storm

Oh dere was a storm all right chuckled Eradicate who having left
his mule Boomerang outside came into the shed It was a giant storm
all right

The men put their hands to their heads and seemed to comprehend They
looked at the rope that bound their feet Their forearms had been
loosened to allow them to take a drink of water

What does this meanRansomKurdy asked Tom sternly when the men
seemed able to talk Did you attack Koku

It looks as though he had the best of us whether we did or not said
the man Tom knew as Kurdy Whew how my head aches

Me sorry said Koku simply

Not half as sorry as we are returned Ransom ruefully

What does it mean asked Tom sternly There were four of you
Feldman and one other got away

Oh trust Feldman for getting away sneered Kurdy He always leaves
his friends in the lurch

Was this a conspiracy demanded Tom

The two captives looked at one another sitting bound on the floor of
the shop their backs against some boxes

I guess its all up and we might as well make a clean breast of it
admitted Kurdy

Perhaps it would be better said Tom quietly Eradicate he went
on to the colored man go to the house and tell Mrs Baggert that
everything is all right and no one hurt

No one hurt Massa Tom What about dem dere fellers and the colored
man pointed to the captives

Well theyre not hurt much and Tom permitted himself a little
smile I dont want my father to worry Tell him everything is all
right

All right Massa Tom Ise gwine right off Ise got t look after mah
mule Boomerang too Ise gwine and he shuffled away

Who else besides Feldman got away asked Tom looking alternately at
the prisoners

They hesitated a moment about answering

We might as well give up I tell you spoke Kurdy to Ransom

All right go ahead well have to take our medicine I might have
known it would turn out this waygoing in for this sort of thing Its
the first bit of crooked business I ever tried the man said
earnestly and it will be the lastbelieve me

Who was the fourth man Tom repeated

Harrison answered Kurdy naming one of the most efficient of the new
machinists Tom had hired during the rush

Harrison who has been working on the motor cried the young inventor

Yes said Ransom

Im sorry to learn that Tom went on in a low voice He was an
expert in his line But what was your object anyhow in attacking
Koku

We didnt intend to attack him explained Ransom but he came in
when we were at work and as he went for us we tried to stand him off
Then your colored man heard the racket andwell I guess you know the
rest

But I dont understand why you came into this shed at night went on
Tom No one is allowed in here You had no right and Koku knew that
What did you want

Look here exclaimed Kurdy I said wed make a clean breast of it
and we will Were only a couple of tools and we were foolish ever to
go in with those fellows or rather in with that Frenchman who
promised us big money if we succeeded

Succeeded in what demanded the young inventor

In damaging your new aerial warship or in getting certain parts of it
so he could take them away with him

Tom gave a surprised whistle

A frenchman he exclaimed Is he one of the

Yes hes one of the foreign spies interrupted Ransom Youd find
it out anyhow if we didnt tell you They are after you Tom Swift
and after your machines They had vowed to get them by fair means or
foul for some of the European governments are desperate

But we were only tools in their hands So were Feldman and Harrison
but they knew more about the details We were only helping them

Then we must try to capture them decided Tom Ned see if the chase
had any results Ill look after these chapsKoku and I

Oh we give in admitted Kurdy We know when weve had enough and
he rubbed his head gently where the giant had banged it against that of
his fellowconspirator

Do you mean that you four came into this shop at midnight to damage
the Mars asked Tom

Thats about it Mr Swift replied Kurdy rather shamefacedly We
were to damage it beyond repair set fire to the whole place if need
be and at the same time take away certain vital parts

Harrison Feldman Ransom and I came in thinking the coast was clear
But Koku must have seen us enter or he suspected we were here for he
came in after us and the fight began We couldnt stop him and he did
for us Im rather glad of it too for I never liked the work It was
only that they tempted me with a promise of big money

Who tempted you demanded Tom

That FrenchmanLa Foy he calls himself and some other foreigners in
your shops

Are there foreigners here cried Tom

Bless my chest protector cried Mr Damon who had come in and had
been a silent listener to this Can it be possible

Thats the case went on Kurdy A lot of the new men you took on are
foreign spies from different European nations They are trying to learn
all they can about your plans Mr Swift

Are they friendly among themselves asked Tom

No each one is trying to get ahead of the other So far the Frenchman
seems to have had the best of it But tonight his plan failed

Tell me more about it urged Tom

Thats about all we know spoke Ransom We were only hired to do the
rough work Those higher up didnt appear Feldman was only a step
above us

Then my suspicions of him were justified thought Tom He evidently
met La Foy in the woods to make plans But Koku and Eradicate spoiled
them

The two captives seemed willing enough to make a confession but they
did not know much As they said they were merely tools acting for
others And events had happened just as they had said

The four conspirators had managed by means of a false key and by
disconnecting the burglar alarm to enter the airship shed They were
about to proceed with their work of destruction when Koku came on the
scene

The giants appearance was due to accident He acted as a sort of night
watchman making a tour of the buildings but he entered the shed where
the Mars was because that day he had left his knife in there and
wanted to get it Only for that he would not have gone in When he
entered he surprised the four men

Of course he attacked them at once and they sprang at him Then
ensued a terrific fight Eradicate arising to doctor his mule as he
had said heard the noise and saw what was going on He gave the
alarm

Well Ned any luck asked Tom as his chum came in

No they got away Tom I had a lot of your men out helping me search
the grounds but it wasnt of much use

Particularly if you depended on some of my men said Tom bitterly

What do you mean

I mean that the place is filled with spies Ned But we will sift them
out in the morning This has been a lucky night for me It was touch
and go Now then Koku take these fellows and lock them up somewhere
until morning Ned you and I will remain on guard here the rest of the
night

Im with you Tom

Will you be a bit easy on us considering what we told you asked
Kurdy

Ill do the best I can said Tom gently making no promises

The two captives were put in secure quarters and the rest of the night
passed quietly During the fight in the airship shed some machinery and
tools had been broken but no great amount of damage was done Tom and
Ned passed the remaining hours of darkness there

A further search was made in the morning for the two conspirators who
had escaped but no trace of them was found Tom then realized why
Feldman was so anxious to be placed in the aeroplane departmentit was
in order that he might have easier access to the Mars

A technical charge was made against the two prisoners sufficient to
hold them for some time Then Tom devoted a day to weeding out the
suspected foreigners in his place All the new men were discharged
though some protested against this action

Probably I am hitting some of the innocent in punishing those who if
they had the chance would become guilty Tom said to his chum but
it cannot be helpedI cant afford to take any chances

The Mars was being put in shape for her first flight The guns fitted
with the recoil shock absorbers were mounted and Lieutenant Marbury
had returned to go aloft in the big aerial warship He congratulated
Tom on discovering at least one plot in time

But there may be more he warned the young inventor You are not
done with them yet

The Mars was floated out of her hangar and made ready for an ascent
Tom Ned Lieutenant Marbury Mr Damon and several workmen were to be
the first passengers Tom was busy going over the various parts to see
that nothing had been forgotten

Well I guess were ready he finally announced All aboard

Bless my insurance policy exclaimed Mr Damon Now that the time
comes I almost wish I wasnt going

Nonsense exclaimed Tom Youre not going to back out at the last
minute All aboard Cast off the ropes he cried to the assistants

A moment later the Mars the biggest airship Tom Swift had ever
constructed arose from the earth like some great bird and soared
aloft




CHAPTER XV

IN DANGER


Well Tom were moving cried Ned Newton clapping his chum on the
back as he stood near him in the pilothouse Were going up old
sport

Of course we are replied Tom You didnt think it wouldnt go up
did you

Well I wasnt quite sure Ned confessed You know you were so
worried about

Not about the ship sailing interrupted Tom It was only the effect
the firing of the guns might have But I think we have that taken care
of

Bless my pin cushion cried Mr Damon as he looked over the rail at
the earth below Were moving fast Tom

Yes we can make a quicker ascent in this than in most aeroplanes
Tom said for they have to go up in a slanting direction But we cant
quite equal their lateral speed

Just how fast do you think you can travel when you are in firstclass
shape asked Lieutenant Marbury as he noted how the Mars was
behaving on this the first trip

Well I set a limit of seventyfive miles an hour the young inventor
replied as he shifted various levers and handles to change the speed
of the mechanism But Im afraid we wont quite equal that with all
our guns on board But Im safe in saying sixty I think

That will more than satisfy the government requirements the officer
said But of course your craft will have to come up to expectations
and requirements in the matter of armament

Ill give you every test you want declared Tom with a smile And
now well see what the Mars can do when put to it

Up and up went the big dirigible aerial warship Had you been fortunate
enough to have seen her you would have observed a craft not unlike in
shape the German Zeppelins But it differed from those war balloons in
several important particulars

Toms craft was about six hundred feet long and the diameter of the
gas bag amidships was sixty feet slightly larger than the largest
Zeppelin Below the bag which as I have explained was made up of a
number of gastight compartments hung from wire cables three cabins
The forward one was a sort of pilothouse containing various
instruments for navigating the ship of the air observation rooms
gauges for calculating firing ranges and the steering apparatus

Amidships suspended below the great bag were the living and sleeping
quarters where food was cooked and served and where those who operated
the craft could spend their leisure time Extra supplies were also
stored there

At the stern of the big bag was the motorroom where gas was generated
to fill the balloon compartments when necessary where the gasoline and
electrical apparatus were installed and where the real motive power of
the craft was located Here also was carried the large quantity of
gasoline and oil needed for a long voyage The Mars could carry
sufficient fuel to last for over a week provided no accidents occurred

There was also an arrangement in the motor compartment so that the
ship could be steered and operated from there This was in case the
forward pilothouse should be shot away by an enemy And also in the
motor compartment were the sleeping quarters for the crew

All three suspended cabins were connected by a long covered runway so
that one could pass from the pilothouse to the motorroom and back
again through the amidship cabin

At the extreme end of the big bag were the various rudders and planes
designed to keep the craft on a level keel automatically and to
enable it to make headway against a strong wind The motive power
consisted of three doublebladed wooden propellers which could be
operated together or independently A powerful gasoline engine was the
chief motive power though there was an auxiliary storage battery
which would operate an electrical motor and send the ship along for
more than twentyfour hours in case of accident to the gasoline engine

There were many other pieces of apparatus aboard some not completely
installed the uses of which I shall mention from time to time as the
story progresses The gasgenerating machine was of importance for
there would be a leakage and shrinking of the vapor from the big bag
and some means must be provided for replenishing it

You dont seem to have forgotten anything Tom said Ned admiringly
as they soared upward

We can tell better after weve flown about a bit observed the young
inventor with a smile I expect we shall have to make quite a number
of changes

Are you going far asked Mr Damon

Why youre not frightened are you inquired Tom You have been up
in airships with me before

Oh no Im not frightened exclaimed the odd man Bless my
suspenders no But I promised my wife Id be back this evening and

Well sail over toward Waterford broke in Tom and Ill drop you
down in your front yard

No dont do that Dont I beg of you cried Mr Damon You
seeerTom my wife doesnt like me to make these trips Of course I
understand there is no danger and I like them But its just as well
not to make her worryyou understand

Oh all right replied Tom with a laugh Well were not going far
on this trip What I want to do most of all is to test the guns and
see if the recoil check will work as well when we are aloft as it did
down on the ground You know a balloon isnt a very stable base for a
gun even one of light caliber

No it certainly is not agreed Lieutenant Marbury and I am
interested in seeing how you will overcome the recoil

Well have a test soon announced Tom

Meanwhile the Mars having reached a considerable height being up so
far in fact that the village of Shopton could scarcely be
distinguished Tom set the signal that told the engineroom force to
start the propellers This would send them ahead

Some of Toms most trusted workmen formed the operating crew the young
inventor taking charge of the pilothouse himself

Well she seems to run all right observed Lieutenant Marbury as the
big craft surged ahead just below a stratum of white fleecy clouds

Yes but not as fast as Id like to see her go Tom replied Of
course the machinery is new and it will take some little time for it
to wear down smooth Ill speed her up a little now

They had been running for perhaps ten minutes when Tom shoved over the
hand of an indicator that communicated with the engineroom from the
pilothouse At once the Mars increased her speed

She can do it cried Ned

Bless myhat I should say so cried Mr Damon for he was standing
outside the pilothouse just then on the bridge and the sudden
increase of speed lifted his hat from his head

There you arecaught on the fly cried Ned as he put up his hand
just in time to catch the article in question

Thanks Guess Id better tie it fast remarked the odd man putting
his hat on tightly

The aerial warship was put through several evolutions to test her
stability and to each one she responded well earning the praise of
the government officer Up and down to one side and the other around
in big circles and even reversing Tom sent his craft with a true hand
and eye In a speed test fiftyfive miles was registered against a
slight wind and the young inventor said he knew he could do better
than that as soon as some of the machinery was running more smoothly

And now suppose we get ready for the gun tests suggested Tom when
they had been running for about an hour

Thats what Im mostly interested in said Lieutenant Marbury Its
easy enough to get several good types of dirigible balloons but few of
them will stand having a gun fired from them to say nothing of several
guns

Well Im not making any rash promises Tom went on but I think we
can turn the trick

The armament of the Mars was located around the center cabin There
were two large guns fore and aft throwing a fourinch projectile and
two smaller calibered quickfirers on either beam The guns were
mounted on pedestals that enabled the weapons to fire in almost any
direction save straight up and of course the balloon bag being above
them prevented this However there was an arrangement whereby a small
automatic quickfirer could be sent up to a platform built on top of
the gas envelope itself and a man stationed there could shoot at a
rival airship directly overhead

But the main deck guns could be elevated to an angle of nearly
fortyfive degrees so they could take care of nearly any hostile
aircraft that approached

But where are the bombs I heard you speaking of asked Ned as they
finished looking at the guns

Here they are spoke Tom as he pointed to a space in the middle of
the main cabin floor He lifted a brass plate and disclosed three
holes covered with a strong wire netting that could be removed The
bombs will be dropped through those holes explained the young
inventor being released by a magnetic control when the operator
thinks he has reached a spot over the enemys city or fortification
where the most damage will be done Ill show you how they work a
little later Now well have a test of some of the guns

Tom called for some of his men to take charge of the steering and
running of the Mars while he and Lieutenant Marbury prepared to fire
the two larger weapons This was to be one of the most important tests

Service charges had been put in though of course no projectiles
would be used since they were then flying over a large city not far
from Shopton

Well have to wait until we get out over the ocean to give a complete
test with a bursting shell Tom said

He and Lieutenant Marbury were beside a gun and were about to fire it
when suddenly from the stern of the ship came a ripping tearing
sound and at the same time confused shouts came from the crews
quarters

What is it cried Tom

One of the propellers was the answer Its split and has torn a
big hole in the gas bag

Bless my overshoes cried Mr Damon Were going down

All on board the Mars became aware of a sudden sinking sensation




CHAPTER XVI

TOM IS WORRIED


Steady all came in even tones from Tom Swift Not for an instant
had he lost his composure For it was an accident that much was
certain and one that might endanger the lives of all on board

Above the noise of the machinery in the motor room could be heard the
thrashing and banging of the broken or loose propellerblade Just
what its condition was could not be told as a bulge of the gas bag
hid it from the view of those gathered about the gun which was about
to be fired when the alarm was given

Were sinking cried Mr Damon Were going down Tom

Thats nothing was the cool answer It is only for a moment Only a
few of the gas compartments can be torn There will soon enough
additional gas in the others to lift us again

And so it proved The moment the pressure of the lifting gas in the big
oiled silk and aluminum container was lowered it started the
generating machine and enough extra gas was pumped into the uninjured
compartments to compensate for the loss

Were not falling so fast now observed Ned

No and well soon stop falling altogether calmly declared Tom Too
bad this accident had to happen though

It might have been much worse my boy exclaimed the lieutenant
Thats a great arrangement of yoursthe automatic gas machine

Its on the same principle as the air brakes of a trolley car
explained Tom when a look at the indicators showed that the Mars had
ceased falling and remained stationary in the air Tom had also sent a
signal to the engineroom to shut off the power so that the two
undamaged propellers as well as the broken one ceased revolving

In a trolley car you see Tom went on when the excitement had
calmed down as soon as the air pressure in the tanks gets below a
certain point caused by using the air for a number of applications of
the brakes it lets a magnetized bar fall and this establishes an
electrical connection starting the air pump The pump forces more air
into the tanks until the pressure is enough to throw the pump switch
out of connection when the pump stops I use the same thing here

And very clever it is said Mr Damon Do you suppose the danger is
all over Tom

For the time being yes But we must unship that damaged propeller
and go on with the two

The necessary orders were given and several men from the engineroom
at once began the removal of the damaged blades

As several spare ones were carried aboard one could be put on in place
of the broken one had this been desired But Tom thought the accident
a good chance to see how his craft would act with only twothirds of
her motive force available so he did not order the damaged propeller
replaced When it was lowered to the deck it was carefully examined

What made it break Ned wanted to know

Thats a question I cant answer Tom replied There may have been a
defect in the wood but I had it all carefully examined before I used
it

The propeller was one of the builtup type with alternate layers of
ash and mahogany but some powerful force had torn and twisted the
blades The wood was splintered and split and some jagged pieces
flying off at a tangent so great was the centrifugal force had torn
holes in the strong gas bag

Did something hit it or did it hit something asked Ned as he saw
Tom carefully examining the broken blades

Hard to say Ill have a good look at this when we get back Just now
I want to finish that gun test we didnt get a chance to start

You dont mean to say youre going to keep on and with the balloon
damaged are you cried Mr Damon in surprise

Certainlywhy not Tom replied In warfare accidents may happen
and if the Mars cant go on after a little damage like this what is
going to happen when shes fired on by a hostile ship Of course Im
going on

Bless my necktie ejaculated the odd man

Thats the way to talk exclaimed Lieutenant Marbury Im with you

There really was very little danger in proceeding The Mars was just as
buoyant as before for more gas had been automatically made and forced
into the uninjured compartments of the bag At the same time enough
sand ballast had been allowed to run out to make the weight to be
lifted less in proportion to the power remaining

True the speed would be less with two propellers instead of three
and the craft would not steer as well with the torn ends of the gas
bag floating out behind But this made a nearer approach to war
conditions and Tom was always glad to give his inventions the most
severe tests possible

So after a little while during which it was seen that the Mars was
proceeding almost normally the matter of discharging the guns was
taken up again

The weapons were all ready to fire and when Tom had attached the
pressure gauges to note how much energy was expended in the recoil he
gave the word to fire

The two big weapons were discharged together and for a moment after
the report echoed out among the cloud masses every soul on the ship
feared another accident had happened

For the big craft rolled and twisted and seemed about to turn turtle
Her forward progress was halted momentarily and a cry of fear came
from several of the members of the crew who had had only a little
experience in aircraft

Whats the matter cried Ned Something go wrong

A little admitted Tom with a rueful look on his face Those
recoil checks didnt work as well in practice as they did in theory

Are you sure they are strong enough asked Lieutenant Marbury

I thought so spoke Tom Ill put more tension on the spring next
time

Bless my watch chain cried Mr Damon You arent going to fire
those guns again are you Tom

Why not We cant tell whats the matter nor get things right
without experimenting Theres no danger

No danger Dont you call nearly upsetting the ship danger

Oh well if she turns over shell right herself again Tom said
The center of gravity is low you see She cant float in any position
but right side up though she may turn over once or twice

Excuse me said Mr Damon firmly Id rather go down if its all
the same to you If my wife ever knew I was here Id never hear the
last of it

Well go down soon Tom promised But I must fire a couple of shots
more You wouldnt call the recoil checks a success would you and
the young inventor appealed to the government inspector

No I certainly would not was the prompt answer I am sorry too
for they seemed to be just what was needed Of course I understand this
is not an official test and I am not obliged to make a report of this
trial But had it been I should have had to score against you

I realize that and Im not asking any favors but Ill try it again
with the recoil checks tightened up I think the hydrostatic valves
were open too much also

Preparations were now made for firing the fourinch guns once more All
this while the Mars had been speeding around in space being about two
miles up in the air Toms craft was not designed to reach as great an
elevation as would be possible in an aeroplane since to work havoc to
an enemys fortifications by means of aerial bombs they do not need to
be dropped from a great height

In fact experiments in Germany have shown that bombs falling from a
great height are less effective than those falling from an airship
nearer the earth For a bomb falling from a height of two miles
acquires enough momentum to penetrate far into the earth so that much
of the resultant explosive force is expended in a downward direction
and little damage is done to the fortifications A bomb dropped from a
lower altitude expending its force on all sides does much more damage

On the other hand in destroying buildings it has been found desirable
to drop a bomb from a good height so that it may penetrate even a
protected roof and explode inside

Once more Tom made ready to fire this time having given the recoil
checks greater resistance But though there was less motion imparted to
the airship when the guns were discharged there was still too much for
comfort or even safety

Well somethings wrong thats sure remarked Tom in rather
disappointed tones as he noted the effect of the second shots If we
get as much recoil from the two guns what would happen if we fired
them all at once

Dont do it Dont do it I beg of you entreated Mr Damon Bless
my toothbrushdont do it

I wontjust at present Tom said ruefully Im afraid Ill have
to begin all over again and proceed along new lines

Well perhaps you will said the lieutenant But you may invent
something much better than anything you have now There is no great
rush Take your time and do something good

Oh Ill get busy on it right away Tom declared Well go down now
and start right to work Im afraid Ned that our idea of a
doorspring check isnt going to work

I might have known my idea wouldnt amount to anything said the
young bank clerk

Oh the idea is all right declared Tom but it wants modifying
There is more power to those recoils than I figured though our first
experiments seemed to warrant us in believing that we had solved the
problem

Are you going to try the bombdropping device asked the lieutenant

Yes there cant be any recoil from that Tom said Ill drop a few
blank ones and see how accurate the range finders are

While his men were getting ready for this test Tom bent over the broken
propeller looking from that to the recoil checks which had not come
up to expectations Then he shook his head in a worried and puzzled
manner




CHAPTER XVII

AN OCEAN FLIGHT


Dropping bombs from an aeroplane or a dirigible balloon is a
comparatively simple matter Of course there are complications that may
ensue from the danger of carrying high explosives in the limited
quarters of an airship with its inflammable gasoline fuel and
everpresent electric spark to the possible premature explosion of the
bomb itself But they seem to be considered minor details now

On the other hand while it is comparatively easy to drop a bomb from a
moving aeroplane or dirigible balloon it is another matter to make
the bomb fall just where it will do the most damage to the enemy It is
not easy to gauge distances high up in the air and then too
allowance must be made for the speed of the aircraft the
everincreasing velocity of a falling body and the deflection caused
by air currents

The law of velocity governing falling bodies is well known It varies
of course according to the height but in general a body falling
freely toward the earth as all highschool boys know is accelerated
at the rate of thirtytwo feet per second This law has been taken
advantage of by the French in the present European war The French drop
from balloons or aeroplanes a steel dart about the size of a lead
pencil and sharpened in about the same manner Dropping from a height
of a mile or so that dart will acquire enough velocity to penetrate a
man from his head all the way through his body to his feet

But in dropping bombs from an airship the damage intended does not so
much depend on velocity It is necessary to know how fast the bomb
falls in order to know when to set the time fuse that will explode it
though some bombs will explode on concussion

At aeroplane meets there are often bombdropping contests and balls
filled with a white powder that will make a dustcloud on falling and
so show where they strike are used to demonstrate the birdmans
accuracy

Well see how our bombrelease works Tom went on But well have to
descend a bit in order to watch the effect

Youre not going to use real bombs are you Tom asked Ned

Indeed not Just chalkdust ones for practice Now here is where the
bombs will be placed and he pointed to the three openings in the
floor of the amidship cabin The wire nettings were taken out and one
could look down through the holes to the earth below the ground being
nearer now as Tom had let out some of the lifting gas

Here is the rangefinder and the speed calculator the young inventor
went on as he indicated the various instruments The operator sits
here where he can tell when is the most favorable moment for releasing
the bomb

Tom took his place before a complicated set of instruments and began
manipulating them One of his assistants under the direction of
Lieutenant Marbury placed in the three openings bombs made of light
cardboard just the size of a regular bomb but filled with a white
powder that would on breaking make a dustcloud which could be
observed from the airship

I have first to determine where I want to drop the bomb Tom
explained and then I have to get my distance from it on the
rangefinder Next I have to know how fast I am traveling and how far
up in the air I am to tell what the velocity of the falling bomb will
attain at a certain time This I can do by means of these instruments
some of which I have adapted from those used by the government he
said with a nod to the officer

Thats righttake all the information you can get was the smiling
response

We will now assume that the bombs are in place in the holes in the
floor of the cabin Tom went on As I sit here I have before me three
buttons They control the magnets that hold the bombs in place If I
press one of the buttons it breaks the electrical current the magnet
no longer has any attraction and it releases the explosive Now look
down I am going to try and drop a chalk bomb near that stone fence

The Mars was then flying over a large field and a stone fence was in
plain view

Here she goes cried Tom as he made some rapid calculations from his
gauge instruments There was a little click and the chalk bomb dropped
There was a plate glass floor in part of the cabin and through this
the progress of the pasteboard bomb could be observed

Shell never go anywhere near the fence declared Ned You let it
drop too soon Tom

Did I You just watch I had to allow for the momentum that would be
given the bomb by the forward motion of the balloon

Hardly had Tom spoken than a puff of white was seen on the very top of
the fence

There it goes cried the lieutenant You did the trick Swift

Yes I thought I would Well that shows my gauges are correct
anyhow Now well try the other two bombs

In succession they were released from the bottom of the cabin at other
designated objects The second one was near a tree It struck within
five feet which was considered good

And Ill let the last one down near that scarecrow in the field said
Tom pointing to a ragged figure in the middle of a patch of corn

Down went the cardboard bomb and so good was the aim of the young
inventor that the white dust arose in a cloud directly back of the
scarecrow

And then a queer thing happened For the figure seemed to come to life
and Ned who was watching through a telescope saw a very much excited
farmer looking up with an expression of the greatest wonder on his
face He saw the balloon over his head and shook his fist at it
evidently thinking he had had a narrow escape But the pasteboard bomb
was so light that had it hit him he would not have been injured
though he might have been well dusted

Why that was a man Bless my pocketbook cried Mr Damon

I guess it was agreed Tom I took it for a scarecrow

Well it proved the accuracy of your aim at any rate observed
Lieutenant Marbury The bomb dropping device of your aerial warship is
perfectI can testify to that

And Ill have the guns fixed soon so there will be no danger of a
recoil too added Tom Swift with a determined look on his face

Whats next asked Mr Damon looking at his watch I really ought
to be home Tom

Were going back now and down Are you sure you dont want me to drop
you in your own front yard or even on your roof I think I could
manage that

Bless my stovepipe no Tom My wife would have hysterics Just land
me at Shopton and Ill take a car home

The damaged airship seemed little the worse for the test to which she
had been subjected and made her way at good speed in the direction of
Toms home Several little experiments were tried on the way back They
all worked well and the only two problems Tom had to solve were the
taking care of the recoil from the guns and finding out why the
propeller had broken

A safe landing was made and the Mars once more put away in her hangar
Mr Damon departed for his home and Lieutenant Marbury again took up
his residence in the Swift household

Well Tom how did it go asked his father

Not so very well Too much recoil from the guns

I was afraid so You had better drop this line of work and go at
something else

No Dad Tom cried Im going to make this work I never had
anything stump me yet and Im not going to begin now

Well thats a good spirit to show said the aged inventor with a
shake of his head but I dont believe youll succeed Tom

Yes I will Dad You just wait

Tom decided to begin on the problem of the propeller first as that
seemed more simple He knew that the gun question would take longer

Just what are you trying to find out Tom asked Ned a few nights
later when he found his chum looking at the broken parts of the
propeller

Trying to discover what made this blade break up and splinter that
way It couldnt have been centrifugal force for it wasnt strong
enough

Tom was poking away amid splinters and bits of broken wood when he
suddenly uttered an exclamation and held up something Look he
cried I believe Ive found it

What asked Ned

The thing that weakened the propeller Look at this and smell He
held out a piece of wood toward Ned The bank employee saw where a
halfround hole had been bored in what remained of the blade and from
that hole came a peculiar odor

Its some kind of acid ventured Ned

Thats it cried Tom Someone bored a hole in the propeller and put
in some sort of receptacle or capsule containing a corrosive acid In
due time which happened to be when we took our first flight the acid
ate through whatever it was contained in and then attacked the wood of
the propeller blade It weakened the wood so that the force used in
whirling it around broke it

Are you sure of that asked Ned

As sure as I am that Im here Now I know what caused the accident

But who would play such a trick asked Ned We might all have been
killed

Yes I know we might said Tom It must be the work of some of those
foreign spies whose first plot we nipped in the bud I must tell
Marbury of this but dont mention it to dad

I wont promised Ned

Lieutenant Marbury agreed with Tom that someone had surreptitiously
bored a small hole in the propeller blade and had inserted a corrosive
acid that would take many hours to operate The hole had been varnished
over probably so it would not show

And that means Ive got to examine the other two blades Tom said
They may be doctored too

But they did not prove to be A careful examination showed nothing
wrong An effort was made to find out who had tried to destroy the Mars
in midair but it came to nothing The two men in custody declared they
knew nothing of it and there was no way of proving that they did

Meanwhile the torn gas bag was repaired and Tom began working on the
problem of doing away with the gun recoil He tried several schemes
and almost was on the point of giving up when suddenly he received a
hint by reading an account of how the recoil was taken care of on some
of the German Zeppelins

The guns there were made double with the extra barrel filled with
water or sand that could be shot out as was the regular charge As
both barrels were fired at the same time and in opposite directions
with the same amount of powder one neutralized the other and the
recoil was canceled the ship remaining steady after fire

By Jove I believe that will do the trick cried Tom Im going to
try it

Good luck to you cried Ned

It was no easy matter to change all the guns of the Mars and fit them
with double barrels But by working day and night shifts Tom managed
it Meanwhile a careful watch was kept over the shops Several new men
applied for work and some of them were suspicious enough in looks but
Tom took on no new hands

Finally the new guns were made and tried with the Mars held on the
ground They behaved perfectly the shooting of sand or water from the
dummy barrel neutralizing the shot from the service barrel

And now to see how it works in practice cried Tom one day Are you
with me for a long flight Ned

I sure am

The next evening the Mars with a larger crew than before and with
Tom Ned Mr Damon and Lieutenant Marbury aboard set sail

But why start at night asked Ned

Youll see in the morning Tom answered

The Mars flew slowly all night life aboard her at about the level of
the clouds going on almost as naturally as though the occupants of the
cabins were on the earth Excellent meals were served

But when are you going to try the guns asked Ned as he got ready to
turn in

Tell you in the morning replied Tom with a smile

And in the morning when Ned looked down through the plate glass in
the cabin floor he uttered a cry

Why Tom Were over the ocean he cried

I rather thought wed be was the calm reply I told George to head
straight for the Atlantic Now well have a test with service charges
and projectiles




CHAPTER XVIII

IN A STORM


Surprise for the moment held Mr Damon Ned and Lieutenant Marbury
speechless They looked from the heaving waters of the ocean below them
to the young pilot of the Mars He smiled at their astonishment

Whatwhat does it mean Tom asked Ned You never said you were
going to take a trip as far as this

Thats right chimed in Mr Damon Bless my nightcap If I had known
I was going to be brought so far away from home Id never have come

Youre not so very far from Waterford put in Tom We didnt make
any kind of speed coming from Shopton and we could be back again
inside of four hours if we had to

Then you didnt travel fast during the night asked the government
man

No we just drifted along Tom answered I gave orders to run the
machinery slowly as I wanted to get it in good shape for the other
tests that will come soon But I told George whom I left in charge
when I turned in to head for New York I wanted to get out over the
ocean to try the guns with the new recoil arrangement

Well were over the ocean all right spoke Ned as he looked down at
the heaving waters

It isnt the first time replied Tom cheerfully Koku you may serve
breakfast now for the giant had been taken along as a sort of cook
and waiter Koku manifested no surprise or alarm when he found the
airship floating over the sea Whatever Tom did was right to him He
had great confidence in his master

No it isnt the first time weve taken a water flight spoke Ned I
was only surprised at the suddenness of it thats all

Its my first experience so far out above the water observed
Lieutenant Marbury though of course Ive sailed on many seas Why
were out of sight of land

About ten miles out yes admitted Tom Far enough to make it safe
to test the guns with real projectiles That is what I want to do

And weve been running all night asked Mr Damon

Yes but at slow speed The engines are in better shape now than ever
before Tom said Well if youre ready well have breakfast

The meal was served by Koku with as much unconcern as though they were
in the Swift homestead back in Shopton instead of floating near the
clouds And while it was being eaten in the main cabin and while the
crew was having breakfast in their quarters the aerial warship was
moving along over the ocean in charge of George Watson one of Toms
engineers who was stationed in the forward pilothouse

So youre going to give the guns a real test this time is that it
Tom asked Ned as he pushed back his plate a signal that he had
eaten enough

Thats about it

But dont you think its a bit risky out over the water this way
Supposing something shouldshould happen Ned hesitated

You mean we might fall asked Tom with a smile

Yes or turn upside down

Nothing like that could happen Im so sure that I have solved the
problem of the recoil of the guns that Im willing to take chances But
if any of you want to get off the Mars while the test is being made I
have a small boat I can lower and let you row about in that until

No thank you interrupted Mr Damon as he looked below There was
quite a heavy swell on and the ocean did not appear very attractive
They would be much more comfortable in the big Mars

I think you wont have any trouble asserted Lieutenant Marbury I
believe Tom Swift has the right idea about the guns and there will be
so small a shock from the recoil that it will not be noticeable

Well soon know spoke Tom Im going to get ready for the test now

They were now well out from shore over the Atlantic but to make
certain no ships would be endangered by the projectiles Tom and the
others searched the waters to the horizon with powerful glasses
Nothing was seen and the work of loading the guns was begun The bomb
tubes in the main cabin were also to be given a test

As service charges were to be used and as the projectiles were filled
with explosives great care was needed in handling them

Well try dropping bombs first Tom suggested We know they will
work and that will be so much out of the way

To make the test a severe one small floating targets were first
dropped overboard from the Mars Then the aerial warship circling
about came on toward them Tom seated at the rangefinders pressed
the button that released the shells containing the explosives One
after another they dropped into the sea exploding as they fell and
sending up a great column of salt water

Every one a hit reported Lieutenant Marbury who was keeping score

Thats good responded Tom But the others wont be so easy We
have nothing to shoot at

They had to fire the other guns without targets at which to aim But
after all it was the absence of recoil they wanted to establish and
this could be done without shooting at any particular object

One after another the guns were loaded As has been explained they
were now made double one barrel carrying the projectile and the other
a charge of water

Are you ready asked Tom when it was time to fire Lieutenant
Marbury Ned and Mr Damon were helping by being stationed at the
pressure gauges to note the results

All ready answered Ned

Do you think wed better put on life preservers Tom asked Mr Damon

Nonsense What for

In casein case anything happens

Nothing will happen Look out now Im going to fire

The guns were to be fired simultaneously by means of an electric
current when Tom pressed a button

Here they go exclaimed the young inventor

There was a moment of waiting and then came a thundering roar The
Mars trembled but she did not shift to either side from an even keel
From one barrel of the guns shot out the explosive projectiles and
from the other spurted a jet of water sent out by a charge of powder
equal in weight to that which forced out the shot

As the projectile was fired in one direction and the water in one
directly opposite the two discharges neutralized one another

Out flew the pointed steel shells to fall harmlessly into the sea
where they exploded sending up columns of water

Well cried Tom as the echoes died away How was it

Couldnt have been better declared Lieutenant Marbury There
wasnt the least shock of recoil Tom Swift you have solved the
problem I do believe Your aerial warship is a success

Im glad to hear you say so There are one or two little things that
need changing but I really think I have about what the United States
Government wants

I am also of that belief Tom If only The officer stopped
suddenly

Well asked Tom suggestively

I was going to say if only those foreign spies dont make trouble

I think weve seen the last of them Tom declared Now well go on
with the tests

More guns were fired singly and in batteries and in each case the
Mars stood the test perfectly The double barrel had solved the recoil
problem

For some little time longer they remained out over the sea going
through some evolutions to test the rudder control and then as their
present object had been accomplished Tom gave orders to head back to
Shopton which place was reached in due time

Well Tom how was it asked Mr Swift for though his son had said
nothing to his friends about the prospective test the aged inventor
knew about it

Successful Dad in every particular

Thats good I didnt think you could do it But you did I tell you
it isnt much that can get the best of a Swift exclaimed the aged man
proudly Oh by the way Tom heres a telegram that came while you
were gone and he handed his son the yellow envelope

Tom ripped it open with a single gesture and in a flash his eyes took
in the words He read


Look out for spies during trial flights


The message was signed with a name Tom did not recognize

Any bad news asked Mr Swift

Nooh no replied Tom as he crumpled up the paper and thrust it
into his pocket No bad news Dad

Well Im glad to hear that went on Mr Swift I dont like
telegrams

When Tom showed the message to Lieutenant Marbury that official after
one glance at the signature said

Pierson eh Well when he sends out a warning it generally means
something

Whos Pierson asked Tom

Head of the Secret Service department that has charge of this airship
matter There must be something in the wind Tom

Extra precautions were taken about the shops Strangers were not
permitted to enter and all future work on the Mars was kept secret
Nevertheless Tom was worried He did not want his work to be spoiled
just when it was about to be a success For that it was a success
Lieutenant Marbury assured him The government man said he would have
no hesitation in recommending the purchase of Toms aerial warship

Theres just one other test I want to see made he said

What is that Tom inquired

In a storm You know we cant always count on having good weather and
Id like to see how she behaves in a gale

You shall declared the young inventor

For the next week during which finishing touches were put on the big
craft Tom anxiously waited for signs of a storm At last they came
Danger signals were put up all along the coast and warnings were sent
out broadcast by the Weather Bureau at Washington

One dull gray morning Tom roused his friends early and announced that
the Mars was going up

A big storm is headed this way Tom said and well have a chance to
see how she behaves in it

And even as the flight began the forerunning wind and rain came in a
gust of fury Into the midst of it shot the big aerial warship with
her powerful propellers beating the moistureladen air




CHAPTER XIX

QUEER HAPPENINGS


Say Tom are you sure youre all right

Of course I am What do you mean

It was Ned Newton who asked the question and Tom Swift who answered
it The chums were in the pilothouse of the dipping swaying Mars
which was nosing her way into the storm fighting on an upward slant
trying if possible to get above the area of atmospheric disturbance

Well I mean are you sure your craft will stand all this straining
pulling and hauling went on Ned as he clung to a brass hand rail
built in the side of the pilothouse wall for the very purpose to which
it was now being put

If she doesnt stand it shes no good cried Tom as he clung to the
steering wheel which was nearly torn from his hands by the deflections
of the rudders

Well its taking a big chance it seems to me went on Ned as he
peered through the rainspotted bullseyes of the pilothouse

Theres no danger declared Tom I wanted to give the ship the
hardest test possible before I formally offered her to the government
If she cant stand a blow like this she isnt what I thought her and
Ill have to build another But Im sure she will stand the racket
Ned Shes built strongly and even if part of the gas bag is carried
away as it was when our propeller shattered we can still sail If you
think this is anything wait until we turn about and begin to fight our
way against the wind

Are you going to do that Tom

I certainly am Were going with the gale now to see what is the
highest rate of speed we can attain Pretty soon Im going to turn her
around and see if she can make any headway in the other direction Of
course I know she wont make much if any speed against the gale but
I must give her that test

Well Tom you know best of course admitted Ned But to me it
seems like taking a big risk

And indeed it did seem not only to Ned but to some of the experienced
men of Toms crew that the young inventor was taking more chances than
ever before and Tom as my old readers well know had in his career
taken some big ones

The storm grew worse as the day progressed until it was a veritable
hurricane of wind and rain The warnings of the Weather Bureau had not
been exaggerated But through the fierce blow the Mars fought her way
As Tom had said she was going with the wind This was comparatively
easy But what would happen when she headed into the storm

Mr Damon in the main cabin sat and looked at Lieutenant Marbury the
eccentric man now and then blessing something as he happened to think
of it

Do youdo you think we are in any danger he finally asked

Not at present replied the government expert

You mean we will belater

Its hard to say I guess Tom Swift knows his business though

Bless my accident insurance policy murmured Mr Damon I wish I had
stayed home If my wife ever hears of this He did not seem able to
finish the sentence

In the engineroom the crew were busy over the various machines Some
of the apparatus was being strained to keep the ship on her course in
the powerful wind and would be under a worse stress when Tom turned
his craft about But so far nothing had given way and everything was
working smoothly

As hour succeeded hour and nothing happened the timid ones aboard
began to take more courage Tom never for a moment lost heart He knew
what his craft could do and he had taken her up in a terrific storm
with a definite purpose in view He was the calmest person aboard with
the exception perhaps of Koku The giant did not seem to know what
fear was He depended entirely on Tom and as long as his young master
had charge of matters the giant was content to obey orders

There was to be no test of the guns this time They had worked
sufficiently well and if need be could have been fired in the gale
But Tom did not want his men to take unnecessary risks nor was he
foolhardy himself

Well have our hands full when we turn around and head into the wind
he said to his chum That will be enough

Then youre really going to give the Mars that test

I surely am I dont want any comebacks from Uncle Sam after he
accepts my aerial warship Ive guaranteed that shell stand up and
make headway against a gale and Im going to prove it

Lieutenant Marbury was told of the coming trial and he prepared to
take official note of it While matters were being gotten in readiness
Tom turned the wheel over to his assistant pilot and went to the
engineroom to see that everything was in good shape to cope with any
emergency The rudders had been carefully examined before the flight
was made to make sure they would not fail for on them depended the
progress of the ship against the powerful wind

I rather guess those foreign spies have given up trying to do Tom an
injury remarked Ned to the lieutenant as they sat in the main cabin
listening to the howl of the wind and the dash of the rain

Well I certainly hope so was the answer But I wouldnt be too
sure The folks in Washington evidently think something is likely to
happen or they wouldnt have sent that warning telegram

But we havent seen anything of the spies Ned remarked

No but that isnt any sign they are not getting ready to make
trouble This may be the calm before the storm Tom must still be on
the lookout It isnt as though his inventions alone were in danger
for they would not hesitate to inflict serious personal injury if their
plans were thwarted

They must be desperate

They are But here comes Tom now He looks as though something new was
about to happen

Take care of yourselves now advised the young aeroinventor as he
entered the cabin finding it hard work to close the door against the
terrific wind pressure

Why asked Ned

Because we are going to turn around and fight our way back against the
gale We may be turned topsyturvy for a second or two

Bless my shoehorn cried Mr Damon Do you mean upside down Tom

No not that exactly But watch out

Tom went forward to the pilothouse followed by Ned and the
lieutenant The latter wanted to take official note of what happened
Tom relieved the man at the wheel and gradually began to alter the
direction of the craft

At first no change was noticeable So strong was the force of the wind
that it seemed as though the Mars was going in the same direction But
Ned noticing a direction compass on the wall saw that the needle was
gradually shifting

Hold fast cried Tom suddenly Then with a quick shift of the rudder
something happened It seemed as though the Mars was trying to turn
over and slide along on her side or as if she wanted to turn about
and scud before the gale instead of facing it But Tom held her to the
reverse course

Can you get her around cried the lieutenant above the roar of the
gale

IIm going to muttered Tom through his set teeth

Inch by inch he fought the big craft through the storm Inch by inch
the indicator showed the turning until at last the grip of the gale
was overcome

Now shes headed right into it cried Tom in exultation Shes
nosing right into it

And the Mars was There was no doubt of it She had succeeded under
Toms direction in changing squarely about and was now going against
the wind instead of with it

But we cant expect to make much speed Tom said as he signaled for
more power for he had lowered it somewhat in making the turn

But Tom himself scarcely had reckoned on the force of his craft for as
the propellers whirled more rapidly the aerial warship did begin to
make headway and that in the teeth of a terrific wind

Shes doing it Tom Shes doing it cried Ned exultingly

I believe she is agreed the lieutenant

Well so much the better Tom said trying to be calm If she can
keep this up a little while Ill give her a rest and well go up above
the storm area and beat back home

The Mars so far had met every test Tom had decided on ten minutes
more of galefighting when from the tube that communicated with the
engineroom came a shrill whistle

See what that is Ned Tom directed

Yes called Ned into the mouthpiece Whats the matter

Short circuit in the big motor was the reply Weve got to run on
storage battery Send Tom back here Something queer has happened




CHAPTER XX

THE STOWAWAYS


Ned repeated the message breathlessly

Short circuit gasped Tom Run on storage battery Ill have to see
to that Take the wheel somebody

Wouldnt it be better to turn about and run before the wind so as
not to put too great a strain on the machinery asked Lieutenant
Marbury

Perhaps agreed Tom Hold her this way though until I see whats
wrong

Ned and the government man took the wheel while Tom hurried along the
runway leading from the pilothouse to the machinery cabin The gale
was still blowing fiercely

The young inventor cast a hasty look about the interior of the place as
he entered He sniffed the air suspiciously and was aware of the odor
of burning insulation

What happened he asked noting that already the principal motive
power was coming from the big storage battery The shift had been made
automatically when the main motor gave out

Its hard to say was the answer of the chief engineer We were
running along all right and we got your word to switch on more power
after the turn We did that all right and she was running as smooth as
a sewingmachine when all of a sudden she shortcircuited and the
storage battery cut in automatically

Think you put too heavy a load on the motor Tom asked

Couldnt have been that The shunt box would have taken that up and
the circuitbreaker would have worked saving us a burnout and thats
what happeneda burnout The motor will have to be rewound

Well no use trying to fight this gale with the storage battery Tom
said after a moments thought Well run before it Thats the
easiest way Then well try to rise above the wind

He sent the necessary message to the pilothouse A moment later the
shift was made and once more the Mars was scudding before the storm
Then Tom gave his serious attention to what had happened in the engine
room

As he bent over the burnedout motor looking at the big shiny
connections he saw something that startled him With a quick motion
Tom Swift picked up a bar of copper It was hot to the touchso hot
that he dropped it with a cry of pain though he had let go so quickly
that the burn was only momentary

Whats the matter asked Jerry Mound Toms engineer

Matter cried Tom A whole lot is the matter That copper bar is
what made the short circuit Its hot yet from the electric current
How did it fall on the motor connections

The engine room force gathered about the young inventor No one could
explain how the copper bar came to be where it was Certainly no one
of Toms employees had put it there and it could not have fallen by
accident for the motor connections were protected by a mesh of wire
and a hand would have to be thrust under them to put the bar in place
Tom gave a quick look at his men He knew he could trust themevery
one But this was a queer happening

For a moment Tom did not know what to think and then as the memory of
that warning telegram came to him he had an idea

Were any strangers in this cabin before the start was made he asked
Mr Mound

Not that I know of was the answer

Well there may be some here now Tom said grimly Look about

But a careful search revealed no one Yet the young inventor was sure
the bar of copper which had done the mischief of shortcircuiting the
motor had been put in place deliberately

In reality there was no danger to the craft since there was power
enough in the storage battery to run it for several hours But the
happening showed Tom he had still to reckon with his enemies

He looked at the height gauge on the wall of the motorroom and noted
that the Mars was going up In accordance with Toms instructions they
were sending her above the storm area Once there with no gale to
fight they could easily beat their way back to a point above Shopton
and make the best descent possible

And that was done while under Toms direction his men took the
damaged motor apart with a view to repairing it

What was it Tom asked Ned coming back to join his chum after
George Ventor the assistant pilot had taken charge of the wheel

I dont exactly know Ned was the answer But I feel certain that
some of my enemies came aboard here and worked this mischief

Your enemies came aboard

Yes and they must be here now The placing of that copper bar proves
it

Then lets make a search and find them Tom It must be some of those
foreign spies

Just what I think

But a more careful search of the craft than the one Tom had casually
made revealed the presence of no one All the crew and helpers were
accounted for and as they had been in Toms service for some time
they were beyond suspicion Yet the fact remained that a seemingly
human agency had acted to put the main motor out of commission Tom
could not understand it

Well it sure is queer observed Ned as the search came to nothing

Its worse than queer declared Tom its alarming I dont know
when Ill be safe if we have ghosts aboard

Ghosts repeated Ned

Well when we cant find out who put that bar in place I might as well
admit it was a ghost spoke Tom Certainly if it was done by a man
he didnt jump overboard after doing it and he isnt here now It sure
is queer

Ned agreed with the last statement at any rate

In due time the Mars having fought her way above the storm came over
Shopton and then the wind having somewhat died out she fought her
way down and after no little trouble was housed in the hangar

Tom cautioned his friends and workmen to say nothing to his father
about the mysterious happening on board

Ill just tell him we had a slight accident and let it go at that
Tom decided No use in causing him worry

But what are you going to do about it asked Ned

Im going to keep careful watch over the aerial warship at any rate
declared Tom If theres a hidden enemy aboard Ill starve him out

Accordingly a guard under the direction of Koku was posted about the
big shed but nothing came of it No stranger was observed to sneak out
of the ship after it had been deserted by the crew The mystery seemed
deeper than ever

It took nearly a week to repair the big motor and during this time
Tom put some improvements on the airship and added the finishing
touches

He was getting it ready for the final government test for the
authorities in Washington had sent word that they would have Captain
Warner in addition to Lieutenant Marbury make the final inspection
and write a report

Meanwhile several little things occurred to annoy Tom He was besieged
with applications from new men who wanted to work and many of these
men seemed to be foreigners Tom was sure they were either spies of
some European nations or the agents of spies and they got no further
than the outer gate

But some strangers did manage to sneak into the works though they were
quickly detected and sent about their business Also once or twice
small fires were discovered in outbuildings but they were soon
extinguished with little damage Extra vigilance was the watchword

And yet with all my precautions they may get me or damage
something declared Tom It is very annoying

It is agreed Ned and we must be doubly on the lookout

So impressed was Ned with the necessity for caution that he arranged to
take his vacation at this time so as to be on hand to help his chum
if necessary

The Mars was nearing completion The repaired motor was better than
ever and everything was in shape for the final test Mr Damon was
persuaded to go along and Koku was to be taken as well as the two
government officials

The night before the trip the guards about the airship shed were
doubled and Tom made two visits to the place before midnight But
there was no alarm

Consequently when the Mars started off on her final test it was
thought that all danger from the spies was over

She certainly is a beauty said Captain Warner as the big craft shot
upward I shall be interested in seeing how she stands gun fire
though

Oh shell stand it declared Lieutenant Marbury The trip was to
consume several days of continuous flying to test the engines A large
supply of food and ammunition was aboard

It was after supper of the first day out and our friends were seated
in the main cabin laying out a program for the next day when sudden
yells came from a part of the motor cabin devoted to storage Koku who
had been sent to get out a barrel of oil was heard to shout

Whats up asked Tom starting to his feet He was answered almost at
once by more yells

Oh Master Come quickly cried the giant There are many men here
There are stowaways aboard




CHAPTER XXI

PRISONERS


For a moment after hearing Kokus reply neither Tom nor his friends
spoke Then Ned in a dazed sort of way repeated

Stowaways

Bless my began Mr Damon but that was as far as he got

From the engine compartment back of the amidship cabin came a sound
of cries and heavy blows The yells of Koku could be heard above those
of the others

Then the door of the cabin where Tom Swift and his friends were was
suddenly burst open and seven or eight men threw themselves within
They were led by a man with a small dark mustache and a little tuft of
whiskers on his chinan imperial He looked the typical Frenchman and
his words snapped out bore out that belief

What he said was in French as Tom understood though he knew little of
that language Also what the Frenchman said produced an immediate
result for the men following him sprang at our friends with
overwhelming fierceness

Before Tom Ned Captain Warner Mr Damon or Lieutenant Marbury could
grasp any weapon with which to defend themselves had their intentions
been to do so they were seized

Against such odds little could be done though our friends did not give
up without a struggle

What does this mean angrily demanded Tom Swift Who are you What
are you doing aboard my craft Who are

His words were lost in smothered tones for one of his assailants put a
heavy cloth over his mouth and tied it there gagging him Another
man with a quick motion whipped a rope about Toms hands and feet
and he was soon securely bound

In like manner the others were treated and despite the struggles of
Mr Damon the two government men and Ned they were soon put in a
position where they could do nothinghelplessly bound and laid on a
bench in the main cabin staring blankly up at the ceiling Each one
was gagged so effectively that he could not utter more than a faint
moan

Of the riot of thoughts that ran through the heads of each one I leave
you to imagine

What did it all mean Where had the strange men come from What did
they mean by thus assaulting Tom and his companions And what had
happened to the others of the crewKoku Jerry Mound the engineer
and George Ventor the assistant pilot

These were only a few of the questions Tom asked himself as he lay
there bound and helpless Doubtless Mr Damon and the others were
asking themselves similar questions

One thing was certainwhatever the stowaways as Koku had called them
had done they had not neglected the Mars for she was running along at
about the same speed though in what direction Tom could not tell He
strained to get a view of the compass on the forward wall of the cabin
but he could not see it

It had been a roughandtumble fight by which our friends were made
prisoners but no one seemed to have been seriously or even slightly
hurt The invaders under the leadership of the Frenchman were rather
ruffled but that was all

Pantingly they stood in line surveying their captives while the man
with the mustache and imperial smiled in a rather superior fashion at
the row of bound ones He spoke in his own tongue to the men who with
the exception of one filed out going as Tom and the others could
note to the engineroom in the rear

I hope I have not had to hurt any of you the Frenchman observed
with sarcastic politeness I regret the necessity that caused me to do
this but believe me it was unavoidable

He spoke with some accent and Tom at once decided this was the same
man who had once approached Eradicate He also recognized him as the
man he had seen in the woods the day of the outing

Hes one of the foreign spies thought Tom and hes got us and the
ship too They were too many for us

Toms anxiety to speak to hold some converse with the captor was so
obvious that the Frenchman said

I am going to treat you as well as I can under the circumstances You
and your other friends who are also made prisoners will be allowed to
be together and then you can talk to your hearts content

The other man who had remained with the evident ringleader of the
stowaways asked a question in French and he used the name La Foy

Ah thought Tom This is the leader of the gang that attacked Koku
in the shop that night They have been waiting their chance and now
they have made good But where did they come from Could they have
boarded us from some other airship

Yet as Tom asked himself that question he knew it could hardly have
been possible The men must have been in hiding on his own craft they
must have been as Koku had cried outstowawaysand have come out at
a preconcerted signal to overpower the aviators

If you will but have patience a little longer went on La Foy for
that was evidently the name of the leader you will all be together
We are just considering where best to put you so that you will not
suffer too much It is quite a problem to deal with so many prisoners
but we have no choice

The two Frenchmen conversed rapidly in their own language for a few
minutes and then there came into the cabin another of the men who had
helped overpower Tom and his friends What he told La Foy seemed to
give that individual satisfaction for he smiled

We are going to put you all together in the largest storeroom which
is partly empty La Foy said There you will be given food and drink
and treated as well as possible under the circumstances You will also
be unbound and may converse among yourselves I need hardly point
out he went on that calling for help will be useless We are a mile
or so in the air and have no intention of descending and he smiled
mockingly

They must know how to navigate my aerial warship thought Tom I
wonder what their game is anyhow

Night had fallen but the cabin was aglow with electric lights The
foreigners in charge of the Mars seemed to know their way about
perfectly and how to manage the big craft By the vibration Tom could
tell that the motor was running evenly and well

But what happened to the othersto Mound Ventor and Koku wondered
Tom

A moment later several of the foreigners entered Some of them did not
look at all like Frenchmen and Tom was sure one was a German and
another a Russian

This will be your prisonfor a while said La Foy significantly and
Tom wondered how long this would be the case A sharp thought came to
himhow long would they be prisoners Did not some other and more
terrible fate await them

As La Foy spoke he opened a storeroom door that led off from the main
or amidship cabin This room was intended to contain the supplies and
stores that would be taken on a long voyage It was one of two being
the larger and now contained only a few odds and ends of little
importance It made a strong prison as Tom well knew having planned
it

One by one beginning with Tom the prisoners were taken up and placed
in a recumbent position on the floor of the storeroom Then were
brought in the engineer and assistant pilot as well as Koku and a
machinist whom Tom had brought along to help him Now the young
inventor and all his friends were together It took four men to carry
Koku in the giant being covered with a network of ropes

On second thought said La Foy as he saw Koku being placed with his
friends I think we will keep the big man with us We had trouble
enough to subdue him Carry him back to the engineroom

So Koku trussed up like some roped steer was taken out again

Now then said La Foy to his prisoners as he stood in the door of
the room I will unbind one of you and he may loose the bonds of the
others

As he spoke he took the rope from Toms hands and then quickly
slipping out locked and barred the door




CHAPTER XXII

APPREHENSIONS


For a moment or two after the ropes binding his hands were loosed Tom
Swift did nothing He was not only stunned mentally but the bonds had
been pulled so tightly about his wrists that the circulation was
impeded and his cramped muscles required a little time in which to
respond

But presently he felt the tingle of the coursing blood and he found he
could move his arms He raised them to his head and then his first
care was to remove the pad of cloth that formed a gag over his mouth
Now he could talk

IIll loosen you all in just a second he said as he bent over to
pick at the knot of the rope around his legs His own voice sounded
strange to him

I dont know what its all about any more than you do he went on
speaking to the others Its a fierce game were up against and weve
got to make the best of it As soon as we can move and talk well
decide whats best to do Whoever these fellows are and I believe they
are the foreign spies Ive been warned about they are in complete
possession of the airship

Tom found it no easy matter to loosen the bonds on his feet The ropes
were well tied and Toms fingers were stiff from the lack of
circulation of blood But finally he managed to free himself When he
stood up in the dim storeroom that was now a prison for all save Koku
he found that he could not walk He almost toppled over so weak were
his legs from the tightness of the ropes He sat down and worked his
muscles until they felt normal again

A few minutes later weak and rather tottery he managed to reach Mr
Damon whom he first unbound He realized that Mr Damon was the oldest
of his friends and consequently would suffer most And it was
characteristic of the eccentric gentleman that as soon as his gag was
removed he burst out with

Bless my wristlets Tom What does it all mean

Thats more than I can say Mr Damon replied Tom with a mournful
shake of his head Im very sorry it happened for it looks as though
I hadnt taken proper care The idea of those men stowing themselves
away on board here and me not knowing it and then coming out
unexpectedly and getting possession of the craft It doesnt speak
very well for my smartness

Oh well Tom anyone might have been fooled by those plotting
foreigners said Mr Damon Now well try to turn matters about and
get the best of them Oh but it feels good to be free once more

He stretched his benumbed and stiffened limbs and then helped Tom free
the others They stood up looking at each other in their dimly lighted
prison

Well if this isnt the limit I dont know what is cried Ned Newton

They got the best of you Tom spoke Lieutenant Marbury

Are they really foreign spies asked Captain Warner

Yes replied his assistant They managed to carry out the plot we
tried to frustrate It was a good trick too hiding on board and
coming out with a rush

Is that what they did asked Mr Damon

It looks so observed Tom The attack must have started in the
engineroom he went on with a look at Mound and Ventor What
happened there he asked

Well thats about the way it was answered the engineer We were
working away making some adjustments oiling the parts and seeing that
everything was running smoothly when all at once I heard Koku yell
He had gone in the oil room At first I thought something had gone
wrong with the ship but when I looked at the giant I saw he was
being attacked by four strange men And before I or any of the other
men could do anything they all swarmed down on us

There must have been a dozen of them and they simply overwhelmed us
One of them hit Koku on the head with an iron bar and that took all
the fight out of the giant or the story might have been a different
one As it was we were overpowered and thats all I know until we
were carried in here and saw you folks all tied up as we were

They burst in on us in the same way Tom explained But where did
they come from Where were they hiding

In the oil and gasoline storeroom that opens out of the motor
compartment answered Mound the engineer It isnt half full you
know and theres room for more than a dozen men in it They must have
gone in some time last night when the airship was in the hangar and
remained hidden among the boxes and barrels until they got ready to
come out and overpower us

Thats it decided Tom But I dont understand how they got in The
hangar was well guarded all night

Some of your men might have been bribed suggested Ned

Yes that is so admitted Tom and later he learned that such had
been the case The foreign spies for such they were had managed to
corrupt one of Toms trusted employees who had looked the other way
when La Foy and his fellowconspirators sneaked into the airship shed
and secreted themselves

Well discussing how they got on board isnt going to do us any good
now Tom remarked ruefully The question iswhat are we going to do

Bless my fountain pen cried Mr Damon Theres only one thing to
do

What is that asked Ned

Why get out of here call a policeman and have these scoundrels
arrested Ill prosecute them Ill have my lawyer on hand to see that
they get the longest terms the statutes call for Bless my pocketbook
but I will and Mr Damon waxed quite indignant

Thats easier said than done observed Tom Swift quietly In the
first place it isnt going to be an easy matter to get out of here

He looked around the storeroom which was then their prison It was
illuminated by a single electric light which showed some boxes and
barrels piled in the rear

Nothing in them to help us get out Tom went on for he knew what the
contents were

Oh well get out declared Ned confidently but I dont believe
well find a policeman ready to take our complaint The upper air isnt
very well patrolled as yet

Thats so agreed Mr Damon I forgot that we were in an airship
But what is to be done Tom We really are captives aboard our own
craft

Yes worse luck returned the young inventor I feel foolish when I
think how we let them take us prisoners

We couldnt help it Ned commented They came on us too suddenly We
didnt have a chance And they outnumbered us two to one If they could
take care of big Koku what chance did we have

Very little said Engineer Mound They were desperate fellows They
know something about aircraft too For as soon as Koku Ventor and I
were disposed of some of them went at the machinery as if they had
been used to running it all their lives

Oh the foreigners are experts when it comes to craft of the air
said Captain Warner

Well they seem to be running her all right admitted the young
inventor and at good speed too They have increased our running
rate if I am any judge

By several miles an hour confirmed the assistant pilot Though in
which direction they are heading and what they are going to do with us
is more than I can guess

Thats so agreed Mr Damon What is to become of us They may heave
us overboard into the ocean

Into the ocean cried Ned apprehensively Are we near the sea

We must be by this time spoke Tom We were headed in that
direction and we have come almost far enough to put us somewhere over
the Atlantic off the Jersey coast

A look of apprehension was on the faces of all But Toms face did not
remain clouded long

We wont try to swim until we have to he said Now lets take an
account of stock and see if we have any means of getting out of this
prison




CHAPTER XXIII

ACROSS THE SEA


With one accord the hands of the captives sought their pockets
Probably the first thought of each one was a knifea pocket knife But
blank looks succeeded their first hopeful ones for the hands came out
empty

Not a thing exclaimed Mr Damon Not a blessed thing They have
even taken my keys andmy fountain pen

I guess they searched us all while they were struggling with us tying
us up suggested Ned I had a knife with a big strong blade but
its gone

So is mine echoed Tom

And I havent even a screwdriver or a pocketwrench declared the
engineer though I had both

They evidently knew what they were doing said Lieutenant Marbury I
dont usually carry a revolver but of late I have had a small
automatic in my pocket Thats gone too

And so are all my things went on his naval friend That Frenchman
La Foy was taking no chances

Well if we havent any weapons or means of getting out of here we
must make them said Tom as hopefully as he could under the
circumstances I dont know all the things that were put in this
storeroom and perhaps there may be something we can use

Shall we make the try now asked Ned Im getting thirsty at least
Lucky we had supper before they came out at us

Well there isnt any water in here or anything to eat of so much I
am sure went on Tom So we will have to depend on our captors for
that

At least we can shout and ask for water said Lieutenant Marbury
They have no excuse for being needlessly cruel

They all agreed that this might not be a bad plan and were preparing
to raise a united shout when there came a knock on the door of their
prison

Are you willing to listen to reason asked a voice they recognized as
that of La Foy

What do you mean by reason asked Tom bitterly You have no right to
impose any conditions on us

I have the right of might and I intend exercising it was the sharp
rejoinder If you will listen to reason

Which kindyours or ours asked Tom pointedly

Mine in this case snapped back the Frenchman What I was going to
say was that I do not intend to starve you or cause you discomfort by
thirst I am going to open the door and put in food and water But I
warn you that any attempt to escape will be met with severe measures

We are in sufficient force to cope with you I think you have seen
that He spoke calmly and in perfect English though with a marked
accent My men are armed and will stand here ready to meet violence
with violence he went on Is that understood

For a moment none of the captives replied

I think it will be better to give in to him at least for a while
said Captain Warner in a low voice to Tom We need water and will
soon need food We can think and plan better if we are well nourished

Then you think I should promise not to raise a row

For the time beingyes

Well I am waiting came in sharp tones from the other side of the
portal

Our answer isyes spoke Tom We will not try to get outjust
yet he added significantly

A key was heard grating in the lock and a moment later the door slid
back Through the opening could be seen La Foy and some of his men
standing armed Others had packages of food and jugs of water A
plentiful supply of the latter was carried aboard the Mars

Keep back from the door was the stern command of La Foy The food
and drink will be passed in only if you keep away from the entrance
Remember my men are armed

The warning was hardly needed for the weapons could plainly be seen
Tom had half a notion that perhaps a concerted rush would carry the day
for him and his friends but he was forced to abandon that idea

While the guards looked on others of the pirate crew as Ned dubbed
them passed in food and water Then the door was locked again

They all felt better after drinking the water which was made cool by
evaporation for the airship was quite high above the earth when Toms
enemies captured it and the young inventor felt sure it had not
descended any

No one felt much like eating however so the food was put away for a
time And then somewhat refreshed they began looking about for some
means of getting out of their prison

Of course we might batter down the door in time by using some of
these boxes as rams said Tom But the trouble is that would make a
noise and they could stand outside and drive us back with guns and
pistols of which they seem to have plenty

Yes and they could turn some of your own quickfirers on us added
Captain Warner No we must work quietly I think and take them
unawares as they took us That is our only plan

We will be better able to see what we have here by daylight Tom
said Suppose we wait until morning

That plan was deemed best and preparations made for spending the night
in their prison

It was a most uncomfortable night for all of them The floor was their
only bed and their only covering some empty bags that had contained
supplies But even under these circumstances they managed to doze off
fitfully

Once they were all awakened by a violent plunging of the airship The
craft seemed to be trying to stand on her head and then she rocked
violently from side to side nearly turning turtle What is it
gasped Ned who was lying next to Tom

They must be trying some violent stunts replied the young inventor
or else we have run into a storm

I think the latter is the case observed Lieutenant Marbury

And as the motion of the craft kept up though less violently this
was accepted as the explanation Through the night the Mars flew but
whither the captives knew not

The first gray streaks of dawn finally shone through the only window of
their prison Sore lame and stiff wearied in body and disturbed in
mind the captives awoke Toms first move was toward the window It
was high up but by standing on a box he could look through it He
uttered an exclamation

What is it asked Ned swaying to and fro from the violent motion of
the aerial warship

We are away out over the sea spoke Tom and in the midst of a bad
storm




CHAPTER XXIV

THE LIGHTNING BOLT


Tom turned away from the window to find his companions regarding him
anxiously

A storm repeated Ned What sort

It might turn into any sort replied Tom All I can see now is a lot
of black clouds and the wind must be blowing pretty hard for theres
quite a sea on

Bless my galvanometer cried Mr Damon Then we are out over the
ocean again Tom

Yes theres no doubt of it

What part asked the assistant pilot

Thats more than I can tell Tom answered

Suppose I take a look suggested Captain Warner Ive done quite a
bit of sailing in my time

But when he had taken a look through the window at which Tom had been
standing the naval officer descended shaking his head

There isnt a landmark in sight he announced We might be over the
middle of the Atlantic for all I could tell

Hardly as far as that spoke Tom They havent been pushing the Mars
at that speed But we may be across to the other side before we realize
it

Hows that asked Ned

Well the ship is in the possession of these foreign spies went on
Tom All their interests are in Europe though it would be hard to say
what nationality is in command here I think there are even some
Englishmen among those who attacked us as well as French Germans
Italians and Russians

Yes it seems to be a combination of European nations against us
admitted Captain Warner Probably after they have made good their
seizure of Toms aerial warship they will portion her out among
themselves or use her as a model from which to make others

Do you think that is their object asked Mr Damon

Undoubtedly was the captains answer It has been the object of
these foreign spies all along not only to prevent the United States
from enjoying the benefits of these progressive inventions but to use
them for themselves They would stop at nothing to gain their ends It
seems we did not sufficiently appreciate their power and daring

Well theyve got us at any rate observed Tom and they may take
us and the ship to some faroff foreign country

If they dont heave us overboard halfway there commented Ned in
rather gloomy tones

Well of course theres that possibility admitted Tom They are
desperate characters

Well we must do something declared Lieutenant Marbury Come its
daylight now and we can see to work better Lets see if we cant find
a way to get out of this prison Say but this sure is a storm he
cried as the airship rolled and pitched violently

They are handling her well though observed Tom as the craft came
quickly to an even keel Either they have a number of expert birdmen
on board or they can easily adapt themselves to a new aircraft She is
sailing splendidly

Well lets eat something and set to work proposed Ned

They brought out the food which had been given to them the night
before but before they could eat this there came a knock on the door
and more food and fresh water was handed in under the same precautions
as before

Tom and his companions indignantly demanded to be released but their
protests were only laughed at and while the guards stood with ready
weapons the door was again shut and locked

But the prisoners were not the kind to sit idly down in the face of
this Under Toms direction they set about looking through their place
of captivity for something by which they could release themselves At
first they found nothing and Ned even suggested trying to cut a way
through the wooden walls with a fingernail file which he found in one
of his pockets when Tom who had gone to the far end of the storeroom
uttered a cry

What is ita way out asked Lieutenant Marbury anxiously

No but means to that end Tom replied Look a file and a saw left
here by some of my workmen perhaps and he brought out the tools He
had found them behind a barrel in the far end of the compartment

Hurray cried Ned Thats the ticket Now well soon show these
fellows whats what

Go easy cautioned Tom We must work carefully It wont do to slam
around and try to break down the door with these I think we had better
select a place on the side wall break through that and make an
opening where we can come out unnoticed Then when we are ready we
can take them by surprise Well have to do something like that for
they outnumber us you know

That is so agreed Captain Warner We must use strategy

Well where would be a good place to begin to burrow out asked Ned

Here said Tom indicating a place far back in the room We can work
there in turns sawing a hole through the wall It will bring us out in
the passage between the aft and amidship cabins and we can go either
way

Then lets begin cried Ned enthusiastically and they set to work

While the aerial warship pitched and tossed in the storm over some
part of the Atlantic Tom and his friends took turns in working their
way to freedom With the sharp end of the file a small hole was made
the work being done as slowly as a rat gnaws so as to make no noise
that would be heard by their captors In time the hole was large enough
to admit the end of the saw

But this took many hours and it was not until the second day of their
captivity that they had the hole nearly large enough for the passage of
one person at a time They had not been discovered they thought

Meanwhile they had been given food and water at intervals but to all
demands that they be released or at least told why they were held
prisoners a deaf ear was turned

They could only guess at the fate of Koku Probably the giant was kept
bound for once he got the chance to use his enormous strength it might
go hard with the foreigners

The Mars continued to fly through the air Sometimes as Tom and his
friends could tell by the motion she was almost stationary in the
upper regions and again she seemed to be flying at top speed
Occasionally there came the sound of firing

Theyre trying my guns observed Tom grimly

Do you suppose they are being attacked asked Ned hopefully

Hardly replied Captain Warner The United States possesses no craft
able to cope with this one in aerial warfare and they are hardly
engaging in part of the European war yet I think they are just trying
Toms new guns

Later our friends learned that such was the case

The storm had either passed or the Mars had run out of the path of it
for after the first few hours of pitching and tossing the atmosphere
seemed reduced to a state of calm

All the while they were secretly working to gain their freedom so they
might attack and overpower their enemies they took occasional
observations from the small window But they could learn nothing of
their whereabouts They could only view the heaving ocean far below
them or see a mass of cloudmist which hid the earth if so be that
the Mars was sailing over land

But how much longer can they keep it up asked Ned

Well we have fuel and supplies aboard for nearly two weeks Tom
answered

And by the end of that time we may all be dead spoke the young bank
clerk despondently

No well be out of here before then declared Lieutenant Marbury

Indeed the hole was now almost large enough to enable them to crawl out
one at a time They could not of course see how it looked from the
outside but Tom had selected a place for its cutting so that the
sawdust and the mark of the panel that was being removed would not
ordinarily be noticeable

They set night as the time for making the attemptlate at night when
it was hoped that most of their captors would be asleep

Finally the last cut was made and a piece of wood hung over the
opening only by a shred all ready to knock out

Well do it at midnight announced Tom

Anxious indeed were those last hours of waiting The time had almost
arrived for the attempt when Tom who had been nervously pacing to and
fro remarked

We must be running into another storm Feel how she heaves and rolls

Indeed the Mars was most unsteady

It sure is a storm cried Ned and a heavy one too for there came
a burst of thunder that seemed like a report of Toms giant cannon

In another instant they were in the midst of a violent thunderstorm
the airship pitching and tossing in a manner to almost throw them from
their feet

As Tom reached up to switch on the electric light again there came a
flash of lightning that well nigh blinded them And so close after it
as to seem simultaneous there came such a crash of thunder as to stun
them all There was a tingling as of a thousand pins and needles in
the body of each of the captives and a strong smell of sulphur Then
as the echoes of the clap died away Tom yelled

Shes been struck The airship has been struck




CHAPTER XXV

FREEDOM


For a moment there was silence following Toms wild cry and the noise
of the thunderclap Then as other though less loud reverberations of
the storm continued to sound the captives awoke to a realization of
what had happened They had been partially stunned and were almost as
in a dream

Areare we all right stammered Ned

Bless my soul What has happened cried Mr Damon

Weve been struck by lightning Tom repeated I dont know whether
were all right or not

We seem to be falling exclaimed Lieutenant Marbury

If the whole gas bag isnt ripped to pieces were lucky commented
Jerry Mound

Indeed it was evident that the Mars was sinking rapidly To all there
came the sensation of riding in an elevator in a skyscraper and being
dropped a score of stories

Then as they stood there in the darkness illuminated only by flashes
from the lightning outside the window waiting for an unknown fate Tom
Swift uttered a cry of delight

Weve stopped falling he cried The automatic gas machine is
pumping Part of the gas bag was punctured but the unbroken
compartments hold

If part of the gas leaked out I dont see why it wasnt all set on
fire and exploded observed Captain Warner

Its a nonburnable gas Tom quickly explained But come on This
may be our very chance There seems to be something going on that may
be in our favor

Indeed the captives could hear confused cries and the running to and
fro of many feet

He made for the sawed panel and in another instant had burst out and
was through it out into the passageway between the after and amidship
cabins His companions followed him

They looked into the rear cabin or motor compartment and a scene of
confusion met their gaze Two of the foreign men who had seized the
ship lay stretched out on the floor near the humming machinery which
had been left to run itself A look in the other direction toward the
main cabin showed a group of the foreign spies bending over the inert
body of La Foy the Frenchman stretched out on a couch

What has happened cried Ned What does it all mean

The lightning exclaimed Tom The bolt that struck the ship has
knocked out some of our enemies Now is the time to attack them

The Mars seemed to have passed completely through a narrow storm belt
She was now in a quiet atmosphere though behind her could be seen the
fitful play of lightning and there could be heard the distant rumble
of thunder

Come on cried Tom We must act quickly while they are demoralized
Come on

His friends needed no further urging Jerry Mound and the machinist
rushed to the engineroom to look after any of the enemy that might be
there while Tom Ned and the others ran into the middle cabin

Grab em Tie em up cried Tom for they had no weapons with which
to make an attack

But none were needed So stunned were the foreigners by the lightning
bolt which had miraculously passed our friends and so unnerved by the
striking down of La Foy their leader that they seemed like men half
asleep Before they could offer any resistance they were bound with the
same ropes that had held our friends in bondage That is all but the
big Frenchman himself He seemed beyond the need of binding

Mound the engineer and his assistant came hurrying in from the
motorroom followed by Koku

We found him chained up Jerry explained as the big giant freed
from his captivity rubbed his chafed wrists

Are there any of the foreigners back there

Only those two knocked out by the lightning the engineer explained
Weve made them secure I see youve got things here in shape

Yes replied Tom And now to see where we are and to get back home
Whew But this has been a time Koku what happened to you

They no let anything happen I be in chains all the while the giant
answered Jump on me before I can do anything

Well youre out now and I think well have you stand guard over
these men The tables are turned Koku

The bound ones were carried to the same prison whence our friends had
escaped but their bonds were not taken off and Koku was put in the
place with them By this time La Foy and the two other stricken men
showed signs of returning life They had only been stunned

The young inventor and his friends once more in possession of their
airship lost little time in planning to return They found that the
spies were all expert aeronauts and had kept a careful chart of their
location They were then halfway across the Atlantic and in a short
time longer would probably have been in some foreign country But Tom
turned the Mars about

The craft had only been slightly damaged by the lightning bolt though
three of the gas bag compartments were torn The others sufficed
however to make the ship sufficiently buoyant

When morning came Tom and his friends had matters running almost as
smoothly as before their capture

The prisoners had no chance to escape and indeed they seemed to have
been broken in spirit La Foy was no longer the insolent mocking
Frenchman that he had been and the two chief foreign engineers seemed
to have lost some of their reason when the lightning struck them

But it was a mighty lucky and narrow escape for us said Ned as he
and Tom sat in the pilothouse the second day of the return trip

Thats right agreed his chum

Once again they were above the earth and desiring to get rid as soon
as possible of the presence of the spies a landing was made near New
York City and the government authorities communicated with Captain
Warner and Lieutenant Marbury took charge of the prisoners with some
Secret Service men and the foreigners were soon safely locked up

And now what are you going to do Tom asked Ned when once more
they had the airship to themselves

Im going back to Shopton fix up the gas bag and give her another
government trial was the answer

And in due time this was done Tom added some improvements to the
aircraft making it better than ever and when she was given the test
required by the government she was an unqualified success and the
rights to the Mars were purchased for a large sum In sailing and in
the matter of guns and bombs Toms craft answered every test

So you see I was right after all Dad the young inventor said when
informed that he had succeeded We can shoot off even bigger guns than
I thought from the deck of the Mars

Yes Tom replied the aged inventor I admit I was wrong

Toms aerial warship was even a bigger success than he had dared to
hope Once the government men fully understood how to run it in which
Tom played a prominent part in giving instructions they put the Mars
to a severe test She was taken out over the ocean and her guns
trained on an obsolete battleship Her bombs and projectiles blew the
craft to pieces

The Mars will be the naval terror of the seas in any future war
predicted Captain Warner

The Secret Service men succeeded in unearthing all the details of the
plot against Tom His life at times had been in danger but at the
last minute the man detailed to harm him lost his nerve

It was Toms enemies who had set on fire the red shed and who later
tried to destroy the ship by putting a corrosive acid in one of the
propellers That plot though was not wholly successful Then came the
time when one of the spies hid on board and dropped the copper bar on
the motor shortcircuiting it But for the storagebattery that scheme
might have wrought fearful damage The spy who had stowed himself away
on the craft escaped at night by the connivance of one of Toms corrupt
employees

The foreign spies were tried and found guilty receiving merited
punishment Of course the governments to which they belonged disclaimed
any part in the seizure of Toms aerial warship

It came out at the trial that one of Toms most trusted employees had
proved a traitor and had the night before the test allowed the
foreign spies to secrete themselves on board to rush out at an
opportune time to overpower our hero and his friends But luck was with
Tom at the end

Well what are you going to tackle next Tom asked Ned one day
about a month after these exciting experiences

I dont know was the slow answer I think a selfswinging hammock
under an apple tree with a neveremptying pitcher of icecold lemonade
would be about the thing

Good Tom And if youll invent that Ill share it with you

Well come on lets begin now laughed Tom I need a vacation
anyhow

But it is very much to be doubted if Tom Swift even on a vacation
could refrain from trying to invent something either in the line of
airships water or land craft And so until he again comes to the
front with something new we will take leave of him

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
