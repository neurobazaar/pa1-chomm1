Strings in the earth and air
 Make music sweet

The twilight turns from amethyst
 To deep and deeper blue

At that hour when all things have repose
 O lonely watcher of the skies

When the shy star goes forth in heaven
 All maidenly disconsolate

Lean out of the window
 Goldenhair

 Among the appletrees

 With springtide all adorning her

 Dancing a ringaround in glee

 Put in thy heart my shyly sweet

 Dear eyes that gently me upbraid

Love came to us in time gone by
 When one at twilight shyly played

O it was out by Donnycarney
 When the bat flew from tree to tree

Rain has fallen all the day
 O come among the laden trees

Now O now in this brown land
 Where Love did so sweet music make

Sleep now O sleep now
 O you unquiet heart

XXXV

All day I hear the noise of waters
 Making moan

XXXVI

I hear an army charging upon the land
 And the thunder of horses plunging foam about their knees




CHAMBER MUSIC




I

 Strings in the earth and air
 Make music sweet
 Strings by the river where
 The willows meet

 Theres music along the river
 For Love wanders there
 Pale flowers on his mantle
 Dark leaves on his hair

 All softly playing
 With head to the music bent
 And fingers straying
 Upon an instrument




II

 The twilight turns from amethyst
 To deep and deeper blue
 The lamp fills with a pale green glow
 The trees of the avenue

 The old piano plays an air
 Sedate and slow and gay
 She bends upon the yellow keys
 Her head inclines this way

 Shy thought and grave wide eyes and hands
 That wander as they list
 The twilight turns to darker blue
 With lights of amethyst




III

 At that hour when all things have repose
 O lonely watcher of the skies
 Do you hear the night wind and the sighs
 Of harps playing unto Love to unclose
 The pale gates of sunrise

 When all things repose do you alone
 Awake to hear the sweet harps play
 To Love before him on his way
 And the night wind answering in antiphon
 Till night is overgone

 Play on invisible harps unto Love
 Whose way in heaven is aglow
 At that hour when soft lights come and go
 Soft sweet music in the air above
 And in the earth below




IV

 When the shy star goes forth in heaven
 All maidenly disconsolate
 Hear you amid the drowsy even
 One who is singing by your gate
 His song is softer than the dew
 And he is come to visit you

 O bend no more in revery
 When he at eventide is calling
 Nor muse Who may this singer be
 Whose song about my heart is falling
 Know you by this the lovers chant
 Tis I that am your visitant




V

 Lean out of the window
 Goldenhair
 I hear you singing
 A merry air

 My book was closed
 I read no more
 Watching the fire dance
 On the floor

 I have left my book
 I have left my room
 For I heard you singing
 Through the gloom

 Singing and singing
 A merry air
 Lean out of the window
 Goldenhair




VI

 I would in that sweet bosom be
 O sweet it is and fair it is
 Where no rude wind might visit me
 Because of sad austerities
 I would in that sweet bosom be

 I would be ever in that heart
 O soft I knock and soft entreat her
 Where only peace might be my part
 Austerities were all the sweeter
 So I were ever in that heart




VII

 My love is in a light attire
 Among the appletrees
 Where the gay winds do most desire
 To run in companies

 There where the gay winds stay to woo
 The young leaves as they pass
 My love goes slowly bending to
 Her shadow on the grass

 And where the skys a pale blue cup
 Over the laughing land
 My love goes lightly holding up
 Her dress with dainty hand




VIII

 Who goes amid the green wood
 With springtide all adorning her
 Who goes amid the merry green wood
 To make it merrier

 Who passes in the sunlight
 By ways that know the light footfall
 Who passes in the sweet sunlight
 With mien so virginal

 The ways of all the woodland
 Gleam with a soft and golden fire
 For whom does all the sunny woodland
 Carry so brave attire

 O it is for my true love
 The woods their rich apparel wear
 O it is for my own true love
 That is so young and fair




IX

 Winds of May that dance on the sea
 Dancing a ringaround in glee
 From furrow to furrow while overhead
 The foam flies up to be garlanded
 In silvery arches spanning the air
 Saw you my true love anywhere
 Welladay Welladay
 For the winds of May
 Love is unhappy when love is away




X

 Bright cap and streamers
 He sings in the hollow
 Come follow come follow
 All you that love
 Leave dreams to the dreamers
 That will not after
 That song and laughter
 Do nothing move

 With ribbons streaming
 He sings the bolder
 In troop at his shoulder
 The wild bees hum
 And the time of dreaming
 Dreams is over
 As lover to lover
 Sweetheart I come




XI

 Bid adieu adieu adieu
 Bid adieu to girlish days
 Happy Love is come to woo
 Thee and woo thy girlish ways
 The zone that doth become thee fair
 The snood upon thy yellow hair

 When thou hast heard his name upon
 The bugles of the cherubim
 Begin thou softly to unzone
 Thy girlish bosom unto him
 And softly to undo the snood
 That is the sign of maidenhood




XII

 What counsel has the hooded moon
 Put in thy heart my shyly sweet
 Of Love in ancient plenilune
 Glory and stars beneath his feet
 A sage that is but kith and kin
 With the comedian Capuchin

 Believe me rather that am wise
 In disregard of the divine
 A glory kindles in those eyes
 Trembles to starlight Mine O Mine
 No more be tears in moon or mist
 For thee sweet sentimentalist




XIII

 Go seek her out all courteously
 And say I come
 Wind of spices whose song is ever
 Epithalamium
 O hurry over the dark lands
 And run upon the sea
 For seas and lands shall not divide us
 My love and me

 Now wind of your good courtesy
 I pray you go
 And come into her little garden
 And sing at her window
 Singing The bridal wind is blowing
 For Love is at his noon
 And soon will your true love be with you
 Soon O soon




XIV

 My dove my beautiful one
 Arise arise
 The nightdew lies
 Upon my lips and eyes

 The odorous winds are weaving
 A music of sighs
 Arise arise
 My dove my beautiful one

 I wait by the cedar tree
 My sister my love
 White breast of the dove
 My breast shall be your bed

 The pale dew lies
 Like a veil on my head
 My fair one my fair dove
 Arise arise




XV

 From dewy dreams my soul arise
 From loves deep slumber and from death
 For lo the trees are full of sighs
 Whose leaves the morn admonisheth

 Eastward the gradual dawn prevails
 Where softlyburning fires appear
 Making to tremble all those veils
 Of grey and golden gossamer

 While sweetly gently secretly
 The flowery bells of morn are stirred
 And the wise choirs of faery
 Begin innumerous to be heard




XVI

 O cool is the valley now
 And there love will we go
 For many a choir is singing now
 Where Love did sometime go
 And hear you not the thrushes calling
 Calling us away
 O cool and pleasant is the valley
 And there love will we stay




XVII

 Because your voice was at my side
 I gave him pain
 Because within my hand I held
 Your hand again

 There is no word nor any sign
 Can make amend
 He is a stranger to me now
 Who was my friend




XVIII

 O Sweetheart hear you
 Your lovers tale
 A man shall have sorrow
 When friends him fail

 For he shall know then
 Friends be untrue
 And a little ashes
 Their words come to

 But one unto him
 Will softly move
 And softly woo him
 In ways of love

 His hand is under
 Her smooth round breast
 So he who has sorrow
 Shall have rest




XIX

 Be not sad because all men
 Prefer a lying clamour before you
 Sweetheart be at peace again
 Can they dishonour you

 They are sadder than all tears
 Their lives ascend as a continual sigh
 Proudly answer to their tears
 As they deny deny




XX

 In the dark pinewood
 I would we lay
 In deep cool shadow
 At noon of day

 How sweet to lie there
 Sweet to kiss
 Where the great pineforest
 Enaisled is

 Thy kiss descending
 Sweeter were
 With a soft tumult
 Of thy hair

 O unto the pinewood
 At noon of day
 Come with me now
 Sweet love away




XXI

 He who hath glory lost nor hath
 Found any soul to fellow his
 Among his foes in scorn and wrath
 Holding to ancient nobleness
 That high unconsortable one
 His love is his companion




XXII

 Of that so sweet imprisonment
 My soul dearest is fain
 Soft arms that woo me to relent
 And woo me to detain
 Ah could they ever hold me there
 Gladly were I a prisoner

 Dearest through interwoven arms
 By love made tremulous
 That night allures me where alarms
 Nowise may trouble us
 But sleep to dreamier sleep be wed
 Where soul with soul lies prisoned




XXIII

 This heart that flutters near my heart
 My hope and all my riches is
 Unhappy when we draw apart
 And happy between kiss and kiss
 My hope and all my richesyes
 And all my happiness

 For there as in some mossy nest
 The wrens will divers treasures keep
 I laid those treasures I possessed
 Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep
 Shall we not be as wise as they
 Though love live but a day




XXIV

 Silently shes combing
 Combing her long hair
 Silently and graciously
 With many a pretty air

 The sun is in the willow leaves
 And on the dapplled grass
 And still shes combing her long hair
 Before the lookingglass

 I pray you cease to comb out
 Comb out your long hair
 For I have heard of witchery
 Under a pretty air

 That makes as one thing to the lover
 Staying and going hence
 All fair with many a pretty air
 And many a negligence




XXV

 Lightly come or lightly go
 Though thy heart presage thee woe
 Vales and many a wasted sun
 Oread let thy laughter run
 Till the irreverent mountain air
 Ripple all thy flying hair

 Lightly lightlyever so
 Clouds that wrap the vales below
 At the hour of evenstar
 Lowliest attendants are
 Love and laughter songconfessed
 When the heart is heaviest




XXVI

 Thou leanest to the shell of night
 Dear lady a divining ear
 In that soft choiring of delight
 What sound hath made thy heart to fear
 Seemed it of rivers rushing forth
 From the grey deserts of the north

 That mood of thine
 Is his if thou but scan it well
 Who a mad tale bequeaths to us
 At ghosting hour conjurable
 And all for some strange name he read
 In Purchas or in Holinshed




XXVII

 Though I thy Mithridates were
 Framed to defy the poisondart
 Yet must thou fold me unaware
 To know the rapture of thy heart
 And I but render and confess
 The malice of thy tenderness

 For elegant and antique phrase
 Dearest my lips wax all too wise
 Nor have I known a love whose praise
 Our piping poets solemnize
 Neither a love where may not be
 Ever so little falsity




XXVIII

 Gentle lady do not sing
 Sad songs about the end of love
 Lay aside sadness and sing
 How love that passes is enough

 Sing about the long deep sleep
 Of lovers that are dead and how
 In the grave all love shall sleep
 Love is aweary now




XXIX

 Dear heart why will you use me so
 Dear eyes that gently me upbraid
 Still are you beautifulbut O
 How is your beauty raimented

 Through the clear mirror of your eyes
 Through the soft sigh of kiss to kiss
 Desolate winds assail with cries
 The shadowy garden where love is

 And soon shall love dissolved be
 When over us the wild winds blow
 But you dear love too dear to me
 Alas why will you use me so




XXX

 Love came to us in time gone by
 When one at twilight shyly played
 And one in fear was standing nigh
 For Love at first is all afraid

 We were grave lovers Love is past
 That had his sweet hours many a one
 Welcome to us now at the last
 The ways that we shall go upon




XXXI

 O it was out by Donnycarney
 When the bat flew from tree to tree
 My love and I did walk together
 And sweet were the words she said to me

 Along with us the summer wind
 Went murmuringO happily
 But softer than the breath of summer
 Was the kiss she gave to me




XXXII

 Rain has fallen all the day
 O come among the laden trees
 The leaves lie thick upon the way
 Of memories

 Staying a little by the way
 Of memories shall we depart
 Come my beloved where I may
 Speak to your heart




XXXIII

 Now O now in this brown land
 Where Love did so sweet music make
 We two shall wander hand in hand
 Forbearing for old friendship sake
 Nor grieve because our love was gay
 Which now is ended in this way

 A rogue in red and yellow dress
 Is knocking knocking at the tree
 And all around our loneliness
 The wind is whistling merrily
 The leavesthey do not sigh at all
 When the year takes them in the fall

 Now O now we hear no more
 The vilanelle and roundelay
 Yet will we kiss sweetheart before
 We take sad leave at close of day
 Grieve not sweetheart for anything
 The year the year is gathering




XXXIV

 Sleep now O sleep now
 O you unquiet heart
 A voice crying Sleep now
 Is heard in my heart

 The voice of the winter
 Is heard at the door
 O sleep for the winter
 Is crying Sleep no more

 My kiss will give peace now
 And quiet to your heart
 Sleep on in peace now
 O you unquiet heart




XXXV

 All day I hear the noise of waters
 Making moan
 Sad as the seabird is when going
 Forth alone
 He hears the winds cry to the waters
 Monotone
 The grey winds the cold winds are blowing
 Where I go
 I hear the noise of many waters
 Far below
 All day all night I hear them flowing
 To and fro




XXXVI

 I hear an army charging upon the land
 And the thunder of horses plunging foam about their knees
 Arrogant in black armour behind them stand
 Disdaining the reins with fluttering whips the charioteers
 They cry unto the night their battlename
 I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter
 They cleave the gloom of dreams a blinding flame
 Clanging clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil
 They come shaking in triumph their long green hair
 They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore
 My heart have you no wisdom thus to despair
 My love my love my love why have you left me alone

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
