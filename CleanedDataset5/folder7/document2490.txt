LAMIA

By John Keats




Part 1

 Upon a time before the faery broods
 Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods
 Before King Oberons bright diadem
 Sceptre and mantle claspd with dewy gem
 Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns
 From rushes green and brakes and cowslipd lawns
 The eversmitten Hermes empty left
 His golden throne bent warm on amorous theft
 From high Olympus had he stolen light
 On this side of Joves clouds to escape the sight
 Of his great summoner and made retreat
 Into a forest on the shores of Crete
 For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
 A nymph to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt
 At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
 Pearls while on land they witherd and adored
 Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont
 And in those meads where sometime she might haunt
 Were strewn rich gifts unknown to any Muse
 Though Fancys casket were unlockd to choose
 Ah what a world of love was at her feet
 So Hermes thought and a celestial heat
 Burnt from his winged heels to either ear
 That from a whiteness as the lily clear
 Blushd into roses mid his golden hair
 Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare
 From vale to vale from wood to wood he flew
 Breathing upon the flowers his passion new
 And wound with many a river to its head
 To find where this sweet nymph prepard her secret bed
 In vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found
 And so he rested on the lonely ground
 Pensive and full of painful jealousies
 Of the WoodGods and even the very trees
 There as he stood he heard a mournful voice
 Such as once heard in gentle heart destroys
 All pain but pity thus the lone voice spake
 When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake
 When move in a sweet body fit for life
 And love and pleasure and the ruddy strife
 Of hearts and lips Ah miserable me
 The God dovefooted glided silently
 Round bush and tree softbrushing in his speed
 The taller grasses and fullflowering weed
 Until he found a palpitating snake
 Bright and cirquecouchant in a dusky brake

 She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue
 Vermilionspotted golden green and blue
 Striped like a zebra freckled like a pard
 Eyed like a peacock and all crimson barrd
 And full of silver moons that as she breathed
 Dissolvd or brighter shone or interwreathed
 Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries
 So rainbowsided touchd with miseries
 She seemd at once some penanced lady elf
 Some demons mistress or the demons self
 Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
 Sprinkled with stars like Ariadnes tiar
 Her head was serpent but ah bittersweet
 She had a womans mouth with all its pearls complete
 And for her eyes what could such eyes do there
 But weep and weep that they were born so fair
 As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air
 Her throat was serpent but the words she spake
 Came as through bubbling honey for Loves sake
 And thus while Hermes on his pinions lay
 Like a stoopd falcon ere he takes his prey

 Fair Hermes crownd with feathers fluttering light
 I had a splendid dream of thee last night
 I saw thee sitting on a throne of gold
 Among the Gods upon Olympus old
 The only sad one for thou didst not hear
 The soft lutefingerd Muses chaunting clear
 Nor even Apollo when he sang alone
 Deaf to his throbbing throats long long melodious moan
 I dreamt I saw thee robed in purple flakes
 Break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks
 And swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart
 Strike for the Cretan isle and here thou art
 Too gentle Hermes hast thou found the maid
 Whereat the star of Lethe not delayd
 His rosy eloquence and thus inquired
 Thou smoothlippd serpent surely high inspired
 Thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes
 Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise
 Telling me only where my nymph is fled
 Where she doth breathe Bright planet thou hast said
 Returnd the snake but seal with oaths fair God
 I swear said Hermes by my serpent rod
 And by thine eyes and by thy starry crown
 Light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown
 Then thus again the brilliance feminine
 Too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine
 Free as the air invisibly she strays
 About these thornless wilds her pleasant days
 She tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet
 Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet
 From weary tendrils and bowd branches green
 She plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen
 And by my power is her beauty veild
 To keep it unaffronted unassaild
 By the loveglances of unlovely eyes
 Of Satyrs Fauns and bleard Silenus sighs
 Pale grew her immortality for woe
 Of all these lovers and she grieved so
 I took compassion on her bade her steep
 Her hair in weird syrops that would keep
 Her loveliness invisible yet free
 To wander as she loves in liberty
 Thou shalt behold her Hermes thou alone
 If thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon
 Then once again the charmed God began
 An oath and through the serpents ears it ran
 Warm tremulous devout psalterian
 Ravishd she lifted her Circean head
 Blushd a live damask and swiftlisping said
 I was a woman let me have once more
 A womans shape and charming as before
 I love a youth of CorinthO the bliss
 Give me my womans form and place me where he is
 Stoop Hermes let me breathe upon thy brow
 And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now
 The God on halfshut feathers sank serene
 She breathd upon his eyes and swift was seen
 Of both the guarded nymph nearsmiling on the green
 It was no dream or say a dream it was
 Real are the dreams of Gods and smoothly pass
 Their pleasures in a long immortal dream
 One warm flushd moment hovering it might seem
 Dashd by the woodnymphs beauty so he burnd
 Then lighting on the printless verdure turnd
 To the swoond serpent and with languid arm
 Delicate put to proof the lythe Caducean charm
 So done upon the nymph his eyes he bent
 Full of adoring tears and blandishment
 And towards her stept she like a moon in wane
 Faded before him cowerd nor could restrain
 Her fearful sobs selffolding like a flower
 That faints into itself at evening hour
 But the God fostering her chilled hand
 She felt the warmth her eyelids opend bland
 And like new flowers at morning song of bees
 Bloomd and gave up her honey to the lees
 Into the greenrecessed woods they flew
 Nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do

 Left to herself the serpent now began
 To change her elfin blood in madness ran
 Her mouth foamd and the grass therewith besprent
 Witherd at dew so sweet and virulent
 Her eyes in torture fixd and anguish drear
 Hot glazd and wide with lidlashes all sear
 Flashd phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear
 The colours all inflamd throughout her train
 She writhd about convulsd with scarlet pain
 A deep volcanian yellow took the place
 Of all her mildermooned bodys grace
 And as the lava ravishes the mead
 Spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede
 Made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars
 Eclipsd her crescents and lickd up her stars
 So that in moments few she was undrest
 Of all her sapphires greens and amethyst
 And rubiousargent of all these bereft
 Nothing but pain and ugliness were left
 Still shone her crown that vanishd also she
 Melted and disappeard as suddenly
 And in the air her new voice luting soft
 Cried Lycius gentle LyciusBorne aloft
 With the bright mists about the mountains hoar
 These words dissolvd Cretes forests heard no more

 Whither fled Lamia now a lady bright
 A fullborn beauty new and exquisite
 She fled into that valley they pass oer
 Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas shore
 And rested at the foot of those wild hills
 The rugged founts of the Peraean rills
 And of that other ridge whose barren back
 Stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack
 Southwestward to Cleone There she stood
 About a young birds flutter from a wood
 Fair on a sloping green of mossy tread
 By a clear pool wherein she passioned
 To see herself escapd from so sore ills
 While her robes flaunted with the daffodils

 Ah happy Lyciusfor she was a maid
 More beautiful than ever twisted braid
 Or sighd or blushd or on springflowered lea
 Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy
 A virgin purest lippd yet in the lore
 Of love deep learned to the red hearts core
 Not one hour old yet of sciential brain
 To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain
 Define their pettish limits and estrange
 Their points of contact and swift counterchange
 Intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart
 Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art
 As though in Cupids college she had spent
 Sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent
 And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment

 Why this fair creature chose so fairily
 By the wayside to linger we shall see
 But first tis fit to tell how she could muse
 And dream when in the serpent prisonhouse
 Of all she list strange or magnificent
 How ever where she willd her spirit went
 Whether to faint Elysium or where
 Down through tresslifting waves the Nereids fair
 Wind into Thetis bower by many a pearly stair
 Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine
 Stretchd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine
 Or where in Plutos gardens palatine
 Mulcibers columns gleam in far piazzian line
 And sometimes into cities she would send
 Her dream with feast and rioting to blend
 And once while among mortals dreaming thus
 She saw the young Corinthian Lycius
 Charioting foremost in the envious race
 Like a young Jove with calm uneager face
 And fell into a swooning love of him
 Now on the mothtime of that evening dim
 He would return that way as well she knew
 To Corinth from the shore for freshly blew
 The eastern soft wind and his galley now
 Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
 In port Cenchreas from Egina isle
 Fresh anchord whither he had been awhile
 To sacrifice to Jove whose temple there
 Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare
 Jove heard his vows and betterd his desire
 For by some freakful chance he made retire
 From his companions and set forth to walk
 Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk
 Over the solitary hills he fared
 Thoughtless at first but ere eves star appeared
 His phantasy was lost where reason fades
 In the calmd twilight of Platonic shades
 Lamia beheld him coming near more near
 Close to her passing in indifference drear
 His silent sandals swept the mossy green
 So neighbourd to him and yet so unseen
 She stood he passd shut up in mysteries
 His mind wrappd like his mantle while her eyes
 Followd his steps and her neck regal white
 Turndsyllabling thus Ah Lycius bright
 And will you leave me on the hills alone
 Lycius look back and be some pity shown
 He did not with cold wonder fearingly
 But Orpheuslike at an Eurydice
 For so delicious were the words she sung
 It seemd he had lovd them a whole summer long
 And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up
 Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup
 And still the cup was fullwhile he afraid
 Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
 Due adoration thus began to adore
 Her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure
 Leave thee alone Look back Ah Goddess see
 Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee
 For pity do not this sad heart belie
 Even as thou vanishest so I shall die
 Stay though a Naiad of the rivers stay
 To thy far wishes will thy streams obey
 Stay though the greenest woods be thy domain
 Alone they can drink up the morning rain
 Though a descended Pleiad will not one
 Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
 Thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine
 So sweetly to these ravishd ears of mine
 Came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade
 Thy memory will waste me to a shade
 For pity do not meltIf I should stay
 Said Lamia here upon this floor of clay
 And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough
 What canst thou say or do of charm enough
 To dull the nice remembrance of my home
 Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
 Over these hills and vales where no joy is
 Empty of immortality and bliss
 Thou art a scholar Lycius and must know
 That finer spirits cannot breathe below
 In human climes and live Alas poor youth
 What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
 My essence What serener palaces
 Where I may all my many senses please
 And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease
 It cannot beAdieu So said she rose
 Tiptoe with white arms spread He sick to lose
 The amorous promise of her lone complain
 Swoond murmuring of love and pale with pain
 The cruel lady without any show
 Of sorrow for her tender favourites woe
 But rather if her eyes could brighter be
 With brighter eyes and slow amenity
 Put her new lips to his and gave afresh
 The life she had so tangled in her mesh
 And as he from one trance was wakening
 Into another she began to sing
 Happy in beauty life and love and every thing
 A song of love too sweet for earthly lyres
 While like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires
 And then she whisperd in such trembling tone
 As those who safe together met alone
 For the first time through many anguishd days
 Use other speech than looks bidding him raise
 His drooping head and clear his soul of doubt
 For that she was a woman and without
 Any more subtle fluid in her veins
 Than throbbing blood and that the selfsame pains
 Inhabited her frailstrung heart as his
 And next she wonderd how his eyes could miss
 Her face so long in Corinth where she said
 She dwelt but half retird and there had led
 Days happy as the gold coin could invent
 Without the aid of love yet in content
 Till she saw him as once she passd him by
 Where gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
 At Venus temple porch mid baskets heapd
 Of amorous herbs and flowers newly reapd
 Late on that eve as twas the night before
 The Adonian feast whereof she saw no more
 But wept alone those days for why should she adore
 Lycius from death awoke into amaze
 To see her still and singing so sweet lays
 Then from amaze into delight he fell
 To hear her whisper womans lore so well
 And every word she spake enticd him on
 To unperplexd delight and pleasure known
 Let the mad poets say whateer they please
 Of the sweets of Fairies Peris Goddesses
 There is not such a treat among them all
 Haunters of cavern lake and waterfall
 As a real woman lineal indeed
 From Pyrrhas pebbles or old Adams seed
 Thus gentle Lamia judgd and judgd aright
 That Lycius could not love in half a fright
 So threw the goddess off and won his heart
 More pleasantly by playing womans part
 With no more awe than what her beauty gave
 That while it smote still guaranteed to save
 Lycius to all made eloquent reply
 Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh
 And last pointing to Corinth askd her sweet
 If twas too far that night for her soft feet
 The way was short for Lamias eagerness
 Made by a spell the triple league decrease
 To a few paces not at all surmised
 By blinded Lycius so in her comprized
 They passd the city gates he knew not how
 So noiseless and he never thought to know

 As men talk in a dream so Corinth all
 Throughout her palaces imperial
 And all her populous streets and temples lewd
 Mutterd like tempest in the distance brewd
 To the widespreaded night above her towers
 Men women rich and poor in the cool hours
 Shuffled their sandals oer the pavement white
 Companiond or alone while many a light
 Flared here and there from wealthy festivals
 And threw their moving shadows on the walls
 Or found them clusterd in the corniced shade
 Of some archd temple door or dusky colonnade

 Muffling his face of greeting friends in fear
 Her fingers he pressd hard as one came near
 With curld gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown
 Slowsteppd and robed in philosophic gown
 Lycius shrank closer as they met and past
 Into his mantle adding wings to haste
 While hurried Lamia trembled Ah said he
 Why do you shudder love so ruefully
 Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew
 Im wearied said fair Lamia tell me who
 Is that old man I cannot bring to mind
 His featuresLycius wherefore did you blind
 Yourself from his quick eyes Lycius replied
 Tis Apollonius sage my trusty guide
 And good instructor but tonight he seems
 The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams

 While yet he spake they had arrived before
 A pillard porch with lofty portal door
 Where hung a silver lamp whose phosphor glow
 Reflected in the slabbed steps below
 Mild as a star in water for so new
 And so unsullied was the marble hue
 So through the crystal polish liquid fine
 Ran the dark veins that none but feet divine
 Could eer have touchd there Sounds Aeolian
 Breathd from the hinges as the ample span
 Of the wide doors disclosd a place unknown
 Some time to any but those two alone
 And a few Persian mutes who that same year
 Were seen about the markets none knew where
 They could inhabit the most curious
 Were foild who watchd to trace them to their house
 And but the flitterwinged verse must tell
 For truths sake what woe afterwards befel
 Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus
 Shut from the busy world of more incredulous




Part 2

 Love in a hut with water and a crust
 IsLove forgive uscinders ashes dust
 Love in a palace is perhaps at last
 More grievous torment than a hermits fast
 That is a doubtful tale from faery land
 Hard for the nonelect to understand
 Had Lycius livd to hand his story down
 He might have given the moral a fresh frown
 Or clenchd it quite but too short was their bliss
 To breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss
 Besides there nightly with terrific glare
 Love jealous grown of so complete a pair
 Hoverd and buzzd his wings with fearful roar
 Above the lintel of their chamber door
 And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor

 For all this came a ruin side by side
 They were enthroned in the even tide
 Upon a couch near to a curtaining
 Whose airy texture from a golden string
 Floated into the room and let appear
 Unveild the summer heaven blue and clear
 Betwixt two marble shaftsthere they reposed
 Where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed
 Saving a tythe which love still open kept
 That they might see each other while they almost slept
 When from the slope side of a suburb hill
 Deafening the swallows twitter came a thrill
 Of trumpetsLycius startedthe sounds fled
 But left a thought a buzzing in his head
 For the first time since first he harbourd in
 That purplelined palace of sweet sin
 His spirit passd beyond its golden bourn
 Into the noisy world almost forsworn
 The lady ever watchful penetrant
 Saw this with pain so arguing a want
 Of something more more than her empery
 Of joys and she began to moan and sigh
 Because he mused beyond her knowing well
 That but a moments thought is passions passing bell
 Why do you sigh fair creature whisperd he
 Why do you think returnd she tenderly
 You have deserted mewhere am I now
 Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow
 No no you have dismissd me and I go
 From your breast houseless ay it must be so
 He answerd bending to her open eyes
 Where he was mirrord small in paradise
 My silver planet both of eve and morn
 Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn
 While I am striving how to fill my heart
 With deeper crimson and a double smart
 How to entangle trammel up and snare
 Your soul in mine and labyrinth you there
 Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose
 Ay a sweet kissyou see your mighty woes
 My thoughts shall I unveil them Listen then
 What mortal hath a prize that other men
 May be confounded and abashd withal
 But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical
 And triumph as in thee I should rejoice
 Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinths voice
 Let my foes choke and my friends shout afar
 While through the thronged streets your bridal car
 Wheels round its dazzling spokes The ladys cheek
 Trembled she nothing said but pale and meek
 Arose and knelt before him wept a rain
 Of sorrows at his words at last with pain
 Beseeching him the while his hand she wrung
 To change his purpose He thereat was stung
 Perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim
 Her wild and timid nature to his aim
 Besides for all his love in self despite
 Against his better self he took delight
 Luxurious in her sorrows soft and new
 His passion cruel grown took on a hue
 Fierce and sanguineous as twas possible
 In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell
 Fine was the mitigated fury like
 Apollos presence when in act to strike
 The serpentHa the serpent certes she
 Was none She burnt she lovd the tyranny
 And all subdued consented to the hour
 When to the bridal he should lead his paramour
 Whispering in midnight silence said the youth
 Sure some sweet name thou hast though by my truth
 I have not askd it ever thinking thee
 Not mortal but of heavenly progeny
 As still I do Hast any mortal name
 Fit appellation for this dazzling frame
 Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth
 To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth
 I have no friends said Lamia no not one
 My presence in wide Corinth hardly known
 My parents bones are in their dusty urns
 Sepulchred where no kindled incense burns
 Seeing all their luckless race are dead save me
 And I neglect the holy rite for thee
 Even as you list invite your many guests
 But if as now it seems your vision rests
 With any pleasure on me do not bid
 Old Apolloniusfrom him keep me hid
 Lycius perplexd at words so blind and blank
 Made close inquiry from whose touch she shrank
 Feigning a sleep and he to the dull shade
 Of deep sleep in a moment was betrayd

 It was the custom then to bring away
 The bride from home at blushing shut of day
 Veild in a chariot heralded along
 By strewn flowers torches and a marriage song
 With other pageants but this fair unknown
 Had not a friend So being left alone
 Lycius was gone to summon all his kin
 And knowing surely she could never win
 His foolish heart from its mad pompousness
 She set herself highthoughted how to dress
 The misery in fit magnificence
 She did so but tis doubtful how and whence
 Came and who were her subtle servitors
 About the halls and to and from the doors
 There was a noise of wings till in short space
 The glowing banquetroom shone with widearched grace
 A haunting music sole perhaps and lone
 Supportress of the faeryroof made moan
 Throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade
 Fresh carved cedar mimicking a glade
 Of palm and plantain met from either side
 High in the midst in honour of the bride
 Two palms and then two plantains and so on
 From either side their stems branchd one to one
 All down the aisled place and beneath all
 There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall
 So canopied lay an untasted feast
 Teeming with odours Lamia regal drest
 Silently paced about and as she went
 In pale contented sort of discontent
 Missiond her viewless servants to enrich
 The fretted splendour of each nook and niche
 Between the treestems marbled plain at first
 Came jasper pannels then anon there burst
 Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees
 And with the larger wove in small intricacies
 Approving all she faded at selfwill
 And shut the chamber up close hushd and still
 Complete and ready for the revels rude
 When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude

 The day appeard and all the gossip rout
 O senseless Lycius Madman wherefore flout
 The silentblessing fate warm cloisterd hours
 And show to common eyes these secret bowers
 The herd approachd each guest with busy brain
 Arriving at the portal gazd amain
 And enterd marveling for they knew the street
 Rememberd it from childhood all complete
 Without a gap yet neer before had seen
 That royal porch that highbuilt fair demesne
 So in they hurried all mazd curious and keen
 Save one who lookd thereon with eye severe
 And with calmplanted steps walkd in austere
 Twas Apollonius something too he laughd
 As though some knotty problem that had daft
 His patient thought had now begun to thaw
 And solve and melttwas just as he foresaw

 He met within the murmurous vestibule
 His young disciple Tis no common rule
 Lycius said he for uninvited guest
 To force himself upon you and infest
 With an unbidden presence the bright throng
 Of younger friends yet must I do this wrong
 And you forgive me Lycius blushd and led
 The old man through the inner doors broadspread
 With reconciling words and courteous mien
 Turning into sweet milk the sophists spleen

 Of wealthy lustre was the banquetroom
 Filld with pervading brilliance and perfume
 Before each lucid pannel fuming stood
 A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood
 Each by a sacred tripod held aloft
 Whose slender feet wideswervd upon the soft
 Woolwoofed carpets fifty wreaths of smoke
 From fifty censers their light voyage took
 To the high roof still mimickd as they rose
 Along the mirrord walls by twinclouds odorous
 Twelve sphered tables by silk seats insphered
 High as the level of a mans breast reard
 On libbards paws upheld the heavy gold
 Of cups and goblets and the store thrice told
 Of Ceres horn and in huge vessels wine
 Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine
 Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood
 Each shrining in the midst the image of a God

 When in an antichamber every guest
 Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure pressd
 By ministring slaves upon his hands and feet
 And fragrant oils with ceremony meet
 Pourd on his hair they all movd to the feast
 In white robes and themselves in order placed
 Around the silken couches wondering
 Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring

 Soft went the music the soft air along
 While fluent Greek a voweld undersong
 Kept up among the guests discoursing low
 At first for scarcely was the wine at flow
 But when the happy vintage touchd their brains
 Louder they talk and louder come the strains
 Of powerful instrumentsthe gorgeous dyes
 The space the splendour of the draperies
 The roof of awful richness nectarous cheer
 Beautiful slaves and Lamias self appear
 Now when the wine has done its rosy deed
 And every soul from human trammels freed
 No more so strange for merry wine sweet wine
 Will make Elysian shades not too fair too divine
 Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height
 Flushd were their cheeks and bright eyes double bright
 Garlands of every green and every scent
 From vales deflowerd or foresttrees branch rent
 In baskets of bright osierd gold were brought
 High as the handles heapd to suit the thought
 Of every guest that each as he did please
 Might fancyfit his brows silkpillowd at his ease

 What wreath for Lamia What for Lycius
 What for the sage old Apollonius
 Upon her aching forehead be there hung
 The leaves of willow and of adders tongue
 And for the youth quick let us strip for him
 The thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim
 Into forgetfulness and for the sage
 Let speargrass and the spiteful thistle wage
 War on his temples Do not all charms fly
 At the mere touch of cold philosophy
 There was an awful rainbow once in heaven
 We know her woof her texture she is given
 In the dull catalogue of common things
 Philosophy will clip an Angels wings
 Conquer all mysteries by rule and line
 Empty the haunted air and gnomed mine
 Unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made
 The tenderpersond Lamia melt into a shade

 By her glad Lycius sitting in chief place
 Scarce saw in all the room another face
 Till checking his love trance a cup he took
 Full brimmd and opposite sent forth a look
 Cross the broad table to beseech a glance
 From his old teachers wrinkled countenance
 And pledge him The baldhead philosopher
 Had fixd his eye without a twinkle or stir
 Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride
 Browbeating her fair form and troubling her sweet pride
 Lycius then pressd her hand with devout touch
 As pale it lay upon the rosy couch
 Twas icy and the cold ran through his veins
 Then sudden it grew hot and all the pains
 Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart
 Lamia what means this Wherefore dost thou start
 Knowst thou that man Poor Lamia answerd not
 He gazd into her eyes and not a jot
 Ownd they the lovelorn piteous appeal
 More more he gazd his human senses reel
 Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs
 There was no recognition in those orbs
 Lamia he criedand no softtoned reply
 The many heard and the loud revelry
 Grew hush the stately music no more breathes
 The myrtle sickend in a thousand wreaths
 By faint degrees voice lute and pleasure ceased
 A deadly silence step by step increased
 Until it seemd a horrid presence there
 And not a man but felt the terror in his hair
 Lamia he shriekd and nothing but the shriek
 With its sad echo did the silence break
 Begone foul dream he cried gazing again
 In the brides face where now no azure vein
 Wanderd on fairspaced temples no soft bloom
 Misted the cheek no passion to illume
 The deeprecessed visionall was blight
 Lamia no longer fair there sat a deadly white
 Shut shut those juggling eyes thou ruthless man
 Turn them aside wretch or the righteous ban
 Of all the Gods whose dreadful images
 Here represent their shadowy presences
 May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
 Of painful blindness leaving thee forlorn
 In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
 Of conscience for their long offended might
 For all thine impious proudheart sophistries
 Unlawful magic and enticing lies
 Corinthians look upon that graybeard wretch
 Mark how possessd his lashless eyelids stretch
 Around his demon eyes Corinthians see
 My sweet bride withers at their potency
 Fool said the sophist in an undertone
 Gruff with contempt which a deathnighing moan
 From Lycius answerd as heartstruck and lost
 He sank supine beside the aching ghost
 Fool Fool repeated he while his eyes still
 Relented not nor movd from every ill
 Of life have I preservd thee to this day
 And shall I see thee made a serpents prey
 Then Lamia breathd death breath the sophists eye
 Like a sharp spear went through her utterly
 Keen cruel perceant stinging she as well
 As her weak hand could any meaning tell
 Motiond him to be silent vainly so
 He lookd and lookd again a levelNo
 A Serpent echoed he no sooner said
 Than with a frightful scream she vanished
 And Lycius arms were empty of delight
 As were his limbs of life from that same night
 On the high couch he layhis friends came round
 Supported himno pulse or breath they found
 And in its marriage robe the heavy body wound
