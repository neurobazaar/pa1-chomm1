CHAPTER I

The Derelict

Link Ferris was a fighter Not by nature nor by choice but to keep
alive

His battleground covered an area of forty acresbroken scrubby
uncertain sidehill acres at that In brief a workedout farm among
the mountain slopes of the North Jersey hinterland six miles from the
nearest railroad

The farm was Ferriss by right of sole heritage from his father a
CivilWar veteran who had taken up the wilderness land in 1865 and
who for thirty years thereafter had wrought to make it pay At best
the elder Ferris had wrenched only a meager living from the light and
rockinfested soil

The firstgrowth timber on the west woodlot for some time had staved
off the need of a mortgage its veteran oaks and hickories grimly
giving up their lives in hundreds to keep the wolf from the door of
their owner When the last of the salable timber was gone Old Man
Ferris tried his hand at truck farming and sold his wares from a wagon
to the denizens of Craigswold the new colony of rich folk four miles
to northward

But to raise such vegetables and fruits as would tempt the eyes and the
purses of Craigswold people it was necessary to have more than mere
zeal and industry Sour ground will not readily yield sweet abundance
be the toiler ever so industrious Moreover there was large and
growing competition in the form of other huckster routes

And presently the old veteran wearied of the eternal uphill struggle
He mortgaged the farm dying soon afterward And Link his son was
left to carry on the thankless task

Link Ferris was as much a part of the Ferris farm as was the giant
bowlder in the south mowing He had been born in the paintless shack
which his father had built with his own rheumatic hands He had worked
for more than a quarter century in and out of the hill fields and the
ramshackle barns From babyhood he had toiled there Scant had been the
chances for schooling and more scant had been the opportunities for
outside influence

Wherefore Link had grown to a wirily weedy and slouching manhood
almost as ignorant of the world beyond his mountain walls as were any
of his own critters His life was bounded by fruitless labor varied
only by such sleep and food as might fit him to labor the harder

He ate and slept that he might be able to work And he worked that he
might be able to eat and sleep Beyond that his life was as barren as
a rainy sea

If he dreamed of other and wider things the workaday grind speedily
set such dreams to rout When the gnawing of lonely unrest was too
acute for bovine enduranceand when he could spare the time or the
moneyhe was wont to go to the mileoff hamlet of Hampton and there
get as nearly drunk as his funds would permit

It was his only surcease And as a rule it was a poor one For seldom
did he have enough ready money to buy wholesale forgetfulness More
often he was able to purchase only enough hard cider or fuseloil whisky
to make him dull and vaguely miserable

It was on his way home one Saturday night from such a rudimentary
debauch at Hampton that his Adventure had its small beginning

For a half mile or so of Links homeward pilgrimagebefore he turned
off into the grassgrown rutted hill trail which led to his farmhis
way led along a spur of the state road which linked New York City with
the Ramapo hill country

And here as Link swung glumly along through the springtide dusk his
ears were assailed by a sound that was something between a sigh and a
soba sound as of one who tries valiantly to stifle a whimper of sharp
pain

Ferris halted uncertain at the road edge and peered about him Again
he heard the sound And this time he located it in the long grass of
the wayside ditch The grass was stirring spasmodically too as with
the halfrestrained writhings of something lying close to earth there

Link struck a match Shielding the flame he pushed the tangle of grass
to one side with his foot

There exposed in the narrow space thus cleared and by the narrower
radius of match flare crouched a dog

The brute was huddled in a crumpled heap with one foreleg stuck
awkwardly out in front of him at an impossible angle His tawny mass of
coat was mired and oil streaked In his deepset brown eyes burned the
fires of agony

Yet as he looked up at the man who bent above him the dogs gaze was
neither fierce nor cringing It held rather such an expression as
Dumas tells us the wounded Athos turned to DArtagnanthe aspect of
one in sore need of aid and too proud to plead for it

Link Ferris had never heard of Dumas nor of the immortal musketeer
None the less he could read that look And it appealed to him as no
howl of anguish could have appealed He knelt beside the suffering dog
and fell to examining his hurts

The dog was a colliebeautiful of head sweepingly graceful of line
powerful and heavy coated The mud on his expanse of snowy chest frill
and the grease on his dark brown back were easy to account for even to
Link Ferriss nonetookeen imagination

Link in his own occasional trudges along this bit of state road had
often seen costly dogs in the tonneaus of passing cars He had seen
several of them scramble frantically to maintain their footing on the
slippery seats of such cars when chauffeurs took the sharp curve just
ahead at too high speed He had even seen one Airedale flung bodily
from a cars rear seat at that curve and out into the roadway where a
closefollowing motor had run over and killed it

This collie doubtless had had such a fall and unseen by the front
seats occupants had struck ground with terrific forcea force that
had sent him whirling through mud and grease into the ditch with a
broken front leg

How long the beast had lain there Link had no way of guessing But the
dog was in mortal agony And the kindest thing to do was to put him out
of his pain

Ferris groped around through the gloom until in the ditch his fingers
closed over a tenpound stone One smashing blow on the head with this
missile would bring a swift and merciful end to the sufferers
troubles

Poising the stone aloft Link turned back to where the dog lay
Standing over the victim he balanced the rock and tensed his muscles
for the blow The match had long since gone out but Links
duskaccustomed vision could readily discern the outlines of the
collie And he made ready to strike

Thenperhaps it was the drink playing tricks with Ferriss mindit
seemed to him that he could still see those deepset dark eyes staring
up at him through the murk with that same fearless and yet piteous
look in their depths It was a look that the brief sputter of
matchlight had photographed on Links brain

II aint got the heart to swat you while you keep lookin that way
at me he muttered halfaloud as if to a human companion Jes you
turn your head the other way pup Itll be over quick an easy

By the faint light Link could see the dog had not obeyed the order to
turn his head But at the mans tone of compassion the great plumy
tail began to thump the ground in feeble response

Hm grunted Link letting the stone drop to the road got nerve
too aint you friend Taint every cuss that can wag his tail when
his legs bust

Kneeling down again he examined the broken foreleg more carefully
Gentle as was his touch yet Link knew it must cause infinite torture
But the dog did not flinch He seemed to understand that Ferris meant
kindly for he moved his magnificent head far enough to lick the mans
hand softly and in gratitude

The caress had an odd effect on the loveless Ferris It was the first
voluntary mark of affection he had encountered for longer than he liked
to remember It set old memories to working

The Ferris farm since Links birth had been perhaps the only home in
all that wild region which did not boast a dog of some kind Links
father had had an inborn hatred of dogs He would not allow one on the
place His overt excuse was that they killed sheep and worried cattle
and that he could not afford to risk the wellbeing of his scanty hoard
of stock

Thus Link had grown to manhood with no dog at his heels and without
knowing the normal humans love for canine chumship

The primal instinct long buried stirred within him now at touch of
the warm tongue on his calloused hand and at sound of that friendly
tail wagging in the dry grass Ashamed of the stirrings in him he
sought to explain them by reminding himself that this was probably a
valuable animal and that a reward might be offered for his return In
which case Link Ferris might as well profit by the cash windfall as
anyone else

Taking off his coat Ferris spread it on the ground Then lifting the
stricken collie as gently as he could he deposited him on the coat and
rolled its frayed edges about him After which he picked up the swathed
invalid and bore him home

During the mile trudge the collies sixty pounds grew unbearably heavy
to the halfdrunk Ferris More than once he was minded to set down his
burden and leave the brute to his fate

But always the tardy realization that the journey was more painful to
the dog than to himself gave Link a fresh grip on his determination
And at lasta long and tiring lastthey reached the tumbledown
farmhouse where Link Ferris kept bachelors hall

Laying his patient on the kitchen table Link lighted a candle and went
in search of such rude appliances as his father had been wont to keep
in store for any of the farms animals that might be injured

Three times as a lad Link had seen his father set the broken leg of a
sheep and once he had watched the older man perform a like office for
a yearling heifer whose hind leg had become wedged between two
brookside stones and had sustained a compound fracture From Civil War
hospital experience the father had been a deft bonesetter And
following his recollection of the old mans methods Link himself had
later set the broken leg of one of his lambs The operation had been a
success He resolved now to duplicate it

Slowly and somewhat clumsily he went to work at the injured dog The
collies brave patience nerved him to greater tenderness and care A
veterinary would have made neater work of the bonesetting but hardly
could have rendered the job more effective

When the task was achieved Link brought his patient a bowl of cold
waterwhich the collie drank greedilyand some bread and meat scraps
which the feverish patient would not touch

As he worked at his bonesetting task Ferris had more chance to study
his new acquisition The dog was youngprobably not more than two
years old The teeth proved that He wore a thin collie collar with no
inscription on its silver band

Even to Links inexperienced eye he was an animal of high breeding and
of glorious beauty Link told himself he would perhaps get as much as
ten dollars for the return of so costly a pet And he wondered why the
golden prospect did not seem more alluring

Three times in the night Link got up to give the collie fresh water and
to moisten and readjust the bandages And every time the sight of
his rescuer would cause the dogs tail to thump a joyous welcome and
would fill the dark eyes with a loving gratitude which went straight to
Ferriss lonely heart

In the morning the dog was prevailed upon to lap a saucer of warm milk
and even to nibble at a crust of soaked bread Link was ashamed of his
own keen and growing interest in his find For the first time he
realized how bleakly lonesome had been his home life since the death
of his father had left him solitary


There was a mysteriously comforting companionship in the dogs
presence Link found himself talking to him from time to time as to a
fellow human And the words did not echo back in eerie hollowness from
the walls as when he had sometimes sought to ease his desolation by
talking aloud to himself

He was embarrassed by his general ignorance of dogs and by his
ignorance of this particular dogs name He sought to learn what the
collie had been called by trying one familiar dog name after another
But to such standby cognomens as Rover Tige Fido Ponto Shep and
the rest the patient gave no further sign of recognition than a
friendly wagging of his plumed tail And he wagged it no more
interestedly for one name than for another

So Ferris ceased from the effort and decided to give his pet a
brandnew name for such brief space as they should be housemates After
long deliberation he hit upon the name Chum as typical of the odd
friendship that was springing to life between the dog and himself And
he planned to devote much time to teaching the collie this name

But to his surprise no such tedious period of instruction was
necessary In less than a single day Chum knew his nameknew it past
all doubt

Link was amazed at such cleverness For three solid months at one
time he had striven to teach his horse and his cows and a few of his
sheep to respond to given names And at the end of the course of
patient tutelage he had been morbidly certain that not one of his
solemneyed pupils had grasped the lessons

It was surprisingly pleasant to drop in at the kitchen door nowadays
in intervals between chores or at the days end and be greeted by that
glad glint of the eye and the ecstatic pounding of the wavy tail
against the floor It was still pleasanter to see the gaze of wistful
adoration that strengthened daily as Chum and his new master grew
better and better acquainted

Pleasantest of all was it to sit and talk to the collie in the
oncetedious evenings and to know that his every word was appreciated
and listened to with eager interest even if the full gist of the talk
itself did not penetrate to the listeners understanding

Link Ferris for the first time in his life had a dog Incidentally
for the first time in his life he had an intimate friendsomething of
whose love and loyalty he waxed increasingly sure And he was happy

His brighter spirits manifested themselves in his farm work
transforming drudgery into contentment And the farm began in small
ways to show the effects of its owners new attitude toward labor


The day after he found Chum Link had trudged to Hampton and there
had affixed to the clapboards of the general store a bit of paper
whereon he had scrawled

FoundOne white and brown bird dog with leg broken Owner can have
same by paying a reward

On his next huckster trip to Craigswold he pinned a similar sign to the
bulletin board of that rarefied resorts postoffice And he waited for
results

He did more He bought two successive copies of the countys daily
paper and scanned it for word of a missing dog But in neither copy did
he find what he sought

True both editions carried display advertisements which offered a
seventyfive dollar reward for information leading to the return of a
darksableandwhite collie lost somewhere between Hohokus and
Suffern

The first time he saw this notice Link was vaguely troubled lest it
might refer to Chum He told himself he hoped it did For seventyfive
dollars just now would be a godsend And in selfdisgust he choked back
a most annoying twinge of grief at thought of parting with the dog

Two things in the advertisement puzzled him In the first place as
Chum was longhaired and graceful Link had mentally classified him as
belonging to the same breed as did the setters which accompanied
hunters on mountain rambles past his farm in the autumns Being wholly
unversed in canine lore he had therefore classified Chum as a bird
dog The word collie if ever he had chanced to hear it before
carried no meaning to him

Moreover he did not know what sable meant He asked Dominie Jansen
whom he met on the way home And the dominie told him sable was
another name for black Jansen went on to amplify the theme
dictionaryfashion by quoting a piece of sacred poetry about the
sable wings of night

A great load was off Links heart Chum most assuredly was not black
and white So the advertisement could not possibly refer to him The
reverend gentleman not being a dog fancier of course had no means of
knowing that sable in collie jargon means practically every shade
of color except black or gray or white

Link was ashamed of his own delight in finding he need not give up his
peteven for seventyfive dollars He tried to recall his fathers
invectives against dogs and to remind himself that another mouth to
feed on the farm must mean still sharper poverty and skimping But
logic could not strangle joy and life took on a new zest for the
lonely man

By the time Chum could limp around on the fasthealing foreleg he and
Link had established a friendship that was a boon to both and a stark
astonishment to Ferris

Link had always loved animals He had an inborn way with them Yet
his own intelligence had long since taught him that his farm critters
responded but dully to his attempts at a more perfect understanding

He knew for example that the horse he had bred and reared and had
taught to come at his call would doubtless suffer the first passing
stranger to mount him and ride him away despite any call from his
lifelong master He knew that his presence to the cattle and sheep
meant only food or a shift of quarters and that an outsider could
drive or tend them as readily as could he on whose farm they had been
born Their possible affection for him was a hazy thing based solely
on what he fed them and on their occasional mild interest in being
petted

But with Chum it was all different The dog learned quickly his new
masters moods and met them in kind The few simple tricks Link sought
to teach him were grasped with bewildering ease There was a human
quality of sympathy and companionship which radiated almost visibly
from Chum His keen collie brain was forever amazing Ferris by its
flashes of perception The dog was a revelation and an endless source
of pleasure to the hermitfarmer

When Chum was whole of his hurt and when the injured leg had knit so
firmly that the last trace of lameness was gone Link fell to recalling
his fathers preachments as to the havoc wrought by dogs upon sheep He
could not afford to lose the leanest and toughest of his little sheep
flockeven as price for the happiness of owning a comrade Link
puzzled sorely over this

Then one morning it occurred to him to put the matter up to Chum
himself Hitherto he had kept the dog around the house except on their
daily walks and he had always tied him when driving the sheep to or
from pasture This morning he took the collie along when he went out to
release the tiny flock from their barnyard fold and send them out to
graze

Link opened the fold gate one hand on Chums collar Out billowed the
sheep in a ragged scramble Chum quivered with excitement as the woolly
catapults surged past him Eagerly he looked up into his masters face
then back at the tumbling creatures

Chum spoke Ferris sharply Leave em be Get that LEAVE EM BE

He tightened his hold on the collar as he gave the command Chum ceased
to quiver in eagerness and stood still half puzzled half grieved by
the mans unwonted tone

The sheep at sight and smell of the dog rushed jostlingly from their
pen and scattered in every direction through barnyard and garden and
nearer fields Bleating and stampeding they ran Link Ferris blinked
after them and broke into speech Loudly and luridly he swore

This stampede might well mean an hours running to and fro before the
scattered flock could be herded once more An hour of panting and
blasphemous pursuit at the very outset of an overbusy day And all
because of one worthless dog

His father had been right Link saw thatnow that it was too late A
dog had no place on a farm A poor man could not afford the silly
luxury of a useless pet With whistle and call Ferris sought to check
the flight of the flock But as every farmer knows there is nothing
else on earth quite so unreasonable and idiotic as a scared sheep The
familiar summons did not slacken nor swerve the stampede

The fact that this man had been their protector and friend made no
difference to the idiotic sheep They were frightened And therefore
the tenuously thin connecting line between them and their human master
had snapped For the moment they were merely wild animals and he was a
member of a hostile racealmost as much as was the huge dog that had
caused their fright

A wistful whine from Chum interrupted Links volley of swearing The
dog had noted his masters angry excitement and was seeking to offer
sympathy or help

But the reminder of Chums presence did not check Links wrath at the
unconscious cause of the stampede He loosed his hold on the collar
resolving to take out his rage in an unmerciful beating should the dog
seek to chase the fleeing sheep That would be at least an outlet for
the impotent wrath which Ferris sought to wreak on someone or something

Go get em then if youre so set on it he howled at the collie
waving a windmill arm at the fugitives Only Ill whale your measly
head off if you do

The invitation and the gesture that went with it seemed to rouse some
longdormant memory in the collies soul Like a flash he was off in
flying pursuit of the sheep Ferris in the crazy rage which possessed
him hoped Chum might bite at least one of the senseless creatures that
were causing him such a waste of precious time and of grudged effort

Wherefore he did not call back the fastrunning collie It would be time
enough to whale the daylight out of himyes and to rescue his
possible victims from deathwhen the dog should have overhauled the
woolly pests So in dour fury Link watched the pursuit and the flight

Then of a sudden the black rage in Ferriss visage changed to
perplexity and slowly from that to crass wonderment

Six of the sheep had remained bunched in their runaway dash while all
the rest had scattered singly It was after this bleating sextet that
Chum was now racing

Nor did he stop when he came up with them Tearing past them he wheeled
almost in midair and slackened his pace running transversely ahead of
them and breaking into a clamor of barks

The six seeing their foe menacing them from in front came to a
jumbled and slithering halt preparing to break their formation and to
scatter But Chum would not have it so

Still threatening them with his thunderous bark he made little dashes
at one or another of them that tried to break away and he crowded back
the rest

As a result there was but one direction the dazed sheep could
takethe direction whence they had come And uncertainly
shamblingly they made their way back toward the fold

Scarce had they been fairly started in their cowed progress when Chum
was off at a tangent deserting his six charges and bearing down with
express train speed on a stray wether that had paused in his escape to
nibble at a line of early peas in the truck garden

At sight of the approaching collie the sheep flung up its head and
began again to run But the dog was in front of it whichever way the
panicstricken animal turnedin every direction but one And in that
direction fled the fugitive Nor did it stop in its headlong flight
until it was alongside the six which Chum had first turned

Pausing only long enough to round up one or two sheep which were
breaking loose from the bunch Chum was off again in headlong chase of
still another and another and another stray

Link Ferris in blank incredulity stood gaping at the picture before
himstaring at the tireless swiftness of his dog in turning back and
rounding up a scattered flock which Ferris himself could not have
bunched in twenty times the space of minutes Chum he noted did not
touch one of the foolish beasts His bark and his zigzag dashes served
the purpose without the aid of teeth or of actual contact

Presently as the dumbfounded man gazed the last stray was added to
the milling bleating bunch and Chum was serenely trotting to and fro
driving back such of the sheep as sought to break loose from the
huddle Terrified and trembling but mastered the flock cowered
motionless The work was done

As in a dream Link tumbled toward the prisoners His mind functioning
subconsciously he took up his interrupted task of driving them to
pasture The moment he succeeded in getting them into motion they broke
again And again like a furry whirlwind Chum was encircling them
chasing the strays into place He saw without being told the course
his master was taking and he drove his charges accordingly

Thus in far less time and in better order than ever before the flock
reached the rickety gateway of the stonestrewn sheep pasture and
scuttled jostlingly in through it

Link shut the gate after them Then still in a daze he turned on the
dog

Chum he said confusedly it dont make sense to me not even yet I
dont get the hang of it But I know this much I know you got ten
times the sense what IVE got Where you got it an how you got it the
good Lord only knows But youve got it II was figgerin on lickin
you most to death a few minutes back Chum Honest I was Im clean
shamed to look you in the face when I think of it Say Do me a favor
Chum If ever I lift hand to lick you jes bite me and give me
hydrophoby For Ill sure be deservin it Now come on home

He patted the silken head of the jubilant dog as he talked rumpling
the soft ears and stroking the long blazed muzzle He was sick at
heart at memory of his recent murderous rage at this wondercomrade of
his

Chum was exultantly happy He had had a most exhilarating ten minutes
The jolliest bit of fun he could remember in all his two years of life
The sight of those queer sheepyes and the scent of them especially
the scenthad done queer things to his brain had aroused a million
sleeping ancestral memories

He had understood perfectly well his masters order that he leave them
alone And he had been disappointed by it He himself had not known
clearly what it was he would have liked to do to them But he had known
he and they ought to have some sort of relationship And then at the
gesture and the snarled command of Go get them some closed door in
Chums mind had swung wide and acting on an instinct he himself did
not understand he had hurled himself into the gay task of rounding up
the flock

So for a thousand generations on the Scottish hills had Chums
ancestors earned their right to live And so through successive
generations had they imbued their progeny with that accomplishment
until it had become a primal instinct Even as the unbroken pointer of
the best type knows by instinct the rudiments of his work in the field
so will many a collie take up sheep herding by ancestral training

There had been nothing wonderful in Chums exploit Hundreds of
untrained collies have done the same thing on their first sight of
sheep The craving to chase and slay sheep is a mere perversion of this
olden instinct just as the disorderly flushing and scattering of
bird coveys is a perversion of the pointer or setter instinct Chum
luckily for himself and for his masters flock chanced to run true to
form in this matter of heredity instead of inheriting his tendency in
the form of a taste for sheep murder

The first collie back in prehistoric days was the first dog with the
wit to know his masters sheep apart from all other sheep Perhaps that
is the best if least scientific theory of the collies origin

But to Link Ferriss unsophisticated eyes the achievement was all but
supernatural and it doubled his love for the dog

That afternoon by way of experiment Ferris took Chum along when he
went to drive the sheep back from pasture to the fold By the time he
and the dog were within a hundred yards of the pasture gate Chum began
to dance from sheer anticipation mincing sidewise on the tips of his
toes in true collie fashion and varying the dance by little rushes
forward

Link opened the crazy gate Waiting for no further encouragement the
dog sped into the broad field and among the grazing sheep that were
distributed unevenly over the entire area of the lot

Ordinarilyunless the sheep were ready to come homeit was a matter
of ten or fifteen minutes each evening for Link to collect them and
start them on their way Today in less than three minutes Chum had
the whole flock herded and trotting through the opening to the lane
outside

Nor this time did the sheep flee from him in the same panic dread as
in the morning They seemed to have learnedif indeed a sheep can ever
learn anythingthat Chum was their driver not their enemy

From the fold Link as usual went to the woodlot where his five head of
lean milch cattle were at graze Three of the cows were waiting at the
bars for him but one heifer and a newdry Holstein were hidden
somewhere in the recesses of the secondgrowth timber

The afternoon was hot it had been a hot day Link was tired He
dreaded the labor of exploring ten acres of undergrowth for his two
missing cattle An inspiration came to him Pointing to the three
stolidly waiting cows at the bars he waved his arm in the general
direction of the lot and called on Chum

Go find em Bring em in

Almost before the words were spoken Ferris regretted them He hated to
dim the luster of his dogs earlier exploits by giving him a job beyond
his skill And this time Chum did not flash forward with his former
zest He stood ears cocked glancing uncertainly from Link to the
three cows already waiting

Then as he still peered doubtfully one of the bovine trio took fright
at the dog and trotted clumsily away toward the woods Link gave chase
He had not gone three steps before Chum caught the idea Whirling past
Ferris he headed off the surprised indignant cow and by dint of a
flurry of barks and dashes started her back toward the bars

Her bell jangled dolefully as she obeyed the noisy urge And from
somewhere among the bushes two hundred yards away a second cowbell
sounded in answer At this distant tinkle Chum evidently grasped the
meaning of his masters earlier mandate For he galloped away in the
direction of the sound

And presently with much crashing of undergrowth appeared the
rebellious heifer driven on by Chum After depositing her sulky and
plunging at the bars Chum vanished againin apparent response to
another faroff bell jangle And in three minutes more he was back at
the bars with the fifth cow

Lucky one was a heifer an the other one dry commented Link to the
collie after petting him and praising him for the exploit Ill have
to learn you to drive milch cows easy an quiet You cant run em like
you run sheep an yearlins But apart from that you sure done grand
You can lop off an hour a day of my work if I cn send you reglar for
the critters That ought to be worth the price of your keep by itself
Now if I cn learn you how to milk an maybe how to mowwell
twouldnt be a hull lot queerern the stunts you done today

It was perhaps a week later that Link Ferris received his quarterly
check from the Paterson Vegetable Market These checks hitherto had
been the brightest spots in Links routine Not only did the money for
his hardraised farm products mean a replenishing of the always scant
larder and an easing of the chronic fiscal strain between himself and
the Hampton general stores proprietor but sometimes enough spare cash
was left over to allow Ferris to get very satisfactorily drunk

Since Chums advent the old gnawing of loneliness had not goaded Link
to the Hampton tavern As a consequence he had a dollar or two more on
hand than was usual at such times This wealth was swelled still
further by the fact that a boost in vegetable prices had fattened his
quarterly check beyond its wonted size

All this and his long abstinence seemed to call for a real celebration
And Link looked forward with a thrill of merry anticipation to the
coming of night

As soon as he could clear away his evening chores and swallow some
supper he fared forth to the village This was going to be one of those
nights to date time from Not a miserable halfjag stopped in
midcareer by lack of funds and of credita nippedinthebud debauch
such as so often had sent him home cranky and unsatisfied and railing
against poverty No this was going to be the real thinga record
performance even for these preprohibition times

Ferris fed the collie and shut him into the kitchen pending his own
return from Hampton If Link were going to become blissfully and
helplessly drunk as he had every hope of being someone might take
advantage of his condition to steal his precious dog Therefore Chum
was best left safe at home This Link explained very carefully to the
interestedly listening collie And Chum with head and brush adroop
walked meekly into the kitchen at his masters behest

Link set off for the village happy in the feeling that his home was so
well guarded and that he would find a loving friend waiting to welcome
him on his return What with ready money and a real friend and the
prospect of getting wholesouledly drunk the world was not such a
rotten place to live in after all

As a rule on these occasions Ferris first went to the Hampton store
There he was wont to cash his check pay his longstanding bill order
his new suppliesand then with a free heart sally forth to the
Hampton tavern But tonight having money in his pocket apart from the
check he decided to pay a preliminary call at the tavern just by way
of warming up before going on to the store

There were few people in the barroom at so early an hour of the evening
and on so early an evening of the week Link nodded affably to one or
two men he knew and bade them line up at the bar with him After the
second drink he prepared to leave To the taverns proprietor who was
mildly surprised at the brevity of his call Ferris explained that he
was going across to the store to get his check cashed and that he would
be back later

Whereat the proprietor kindly offered to save Link the journey by
cashing the check for him a suggestion Ferris gladly accepted He
passed the indorsed check across the bar and received for it a
comfortably large wad of wilted greenbacks which he proceeded to intern
with tender care in an inside pocket of his vest where he moored them
with a safetypin Then he ordered another drink

But to this new order there was an instant demurrer Two strangers who
had been drinking at a corner table bore down upon Link right
lovingly and recalled themselves to his memory as companions of his on
a quite forgotten debauch of a year or two back

Link did not at all remember either of the two But then he often
failed to recall people he had met on a spree and he did not like to
hurt these cordial revelers feelings by disclaiming knowledge of them
Especially when they told him merrily that for this evening at least
his money was made of wood and that he must be their guest

Never before had he met with such wholesouled hospitality One drink
followed another with gratifying speed Once or twice Ferris made
halfhearted proffers to do some of the buying But such hints seemed to
hurt his hosts feelings so cruelly that he forbore at last and
suffered himself to drink entirely at their expense

They were much the nicest men Link had ever met They flattered him
They laughed uproariously at his every witticism They had a genius for
noting when his glass was empty They listened with astonished
admiration to his boastful recital of Chums cleverness One of them
who it seemed was an expert in dog lore told him how to teach the
collie to shake hands and to lie down and to speak They were
magnificent men in every way Link was ashamed to have forgotten his
earlier meetings with such paragons

But the call of duty never quite dies into silence And finally Link
remembered he had still his store bill to pay and his supplies to
order So he announced that he must go The store he knew closed at
nine He looked up at the barroom clock But its face was hazy and it
seemed to have a great many hands There was no use trying to learn the
hour from so dissolute a timepiece

His two friends persuaded him to have one more drink Then they
volunteered to go across to the store with him He left the tavern
with one of the two walking on either side of him He was glad to be in
the center of the trio for as the night air struck him he became
unaccountably dizzy His friends willing arms were a grand support to
his wavering legs

On the unlighted threshold of the tavern Link stumbled heavily over
somethingsomething that had been lying there and that sprang eagerly
toward him as he debouched from the doorway The reason he stumbled
over it was that the creature which had bounded so rapturously toward
him had come to a sharp halt at noting his condition Thus Ferris
stumbled over it and would have fallen but for the aid of his friends

The single village street was pitch black Not a light was to be seen
This puzzled Link who had no means of knowing that the time was close
on midnight He started toward the store At least that was the
direction he planned to take But when at the end of five minutes he
found he was outside the village and on a narrow road that bordered the
lake he saw his friends had mistaken the way He stopped abruptly and
told them so

One of them laughed as if Link had said something funny The other did
something quickly with one foot and one arm Ferriss legs went from
under him The jar of his fall shook from him a fraction of his
drunkenness and it gave him enough sense to realize that the man who
had laughed was trying to unfasten the pinned inner pocket of the
fallen mans vest

Now for years that pocket had been the secret repository of Link
Ferriss sparse wealth The intruders touch awakened him to a drowsy
sense of peril He thrust aside the fumbling hand and made a herculean
effort to rise

At this show of resistance his two comrades as by concerted signal
threw themselves upon him With a yell of angry fright Link collapsed
to earth under the dual impact



CHAPTER II

The Battle

He felt one of the men pinion his waving arms while the other crouched
on his legs and proceeded to unpin the money pocket Ferris struggled
for an instant in futile fury trying to shout for help The call was
strangled in his throat But the help came to him none the less

Scarce three seconds had passed since the attempt to rob him had set
Link into action and had wrung from him that yell of consternation

But in answer came a swirling patter of feet on the road a snarl like
a wolfs a shape that catapulted through the dark Sixty pounds of
furswathed dynamic muscle smote athwart the shoulders of the man who
was unfastening the cash pockets pin

The impact hurled the fellow clean off his crouching balance and sent
him sprawling face downward his outflung hands splashing in the
margin of the lake Before he could roll over or so much as stir a set
of white fangs met in his shoulderflesh And he testified to his
injury by an eldritch screech of pain and terror that echoed far across
the water

His companion rallying from the momentary shock left Ferris and
charged at the prostrate thiefs assailant But Chum met him with a
fierce eagerness more than half way

A true colliethanks to his strain of wolf bloodfights as does no
other dog What he lacks in stubborn determination he atones for by
swiftness and by his uncanny brain power

A bulldog for example would have flown to his masters relief quite
as readily as did Chum But a bulldog would have secured the first
convenient hold and would have hung on to that hold whether it were at
his victims throat or only on the slack of his trousersuntil someone
should hammer him into senselessness

Chumcolliefashionwas everywhere at once using his brain far more
than his flying jaws Finding the grip in his foes shoulder did not
prevent the man from twisting round to grapple him the collie shifted
that grip with lightning speed and with one of his gleaming eyeteeth
slashed his opponents halfturned cheek from eye to chin Then he bored
straight for the jugular

It was at this crisis that he sensed rather than saw the other man
rushing at him Chum left his fallen antagonist and whirled about to
face the new enemy As he was still turning he sprang far to one side
in bare time to elude a swinging kick aimed at his head

Then before the thief could recover the balance endangered by so
mighty a kick the collie had whirled in and sunk his teeth deep in the
mans calf The bitten man let out a roar of pain and smote wildly at
the dogs face with both swinging fists

Chum leaped back out of range and then with the same bewildering
speed flashed in again and buried his curved fangs in the nearest of
the two flailing forearms

The first victim of the collies attack was scrambling to his feet So
was Link Ferris Sobered enough to recognize his beloved dog he also
saw the newrisen thief catch up a broken fence rail brandish it aloft
and charge upon the collie who was still battling merrily with the
second man

To Link it seemed that nothing could save Chum from a backbreaking blow
from the huge club Instinctively he ran at the wielder of the
formidable weapon Staggering and sick and twothirds drunk Ferris
nevertheless made valiant effort to save the dog that was fighting so
gallantly for him

His lurching rush carried him across the narrow road and to the lake
edge barely in time to intercept the swinging sweep of the fence rail
It caught him glancingly across the side And its force carried him
clean off his nonetoosteady feet Down went Ferrisdown and
backward His body plunged noisily into the water

Chum had wheeled to face the rails brandisher But at sight of his
masters sudden immersion in the lake he quitted the fray At top
speed the dog cleared the bank and jumped down into the water in
pursuit of Ferris

It evidently dawned on both men at once that there had been a good deal
of noise for what was to have been a silent and decorous holdup Also
that a raging collie is not a pleasant foe The racket might well draw
interference from outside The dog was overhard to kill and his bites
were murderous The game had ceased to be worth the candle By common
impulse the pair took to their heels

Link Ferris head down in the cold water was strangling in his maudlin
efforts to right himself He dug both hands into the lakebottom mud
and strove to gain the surface But the effort was too much for him A
second frantic heave had better results And vaguely he knew why

For Chum had managed to get a firm hold on the shoulder of his masters
coattwelve inches under waterand had braced himself with all his
wiry strength for a tug which should lift Ferris to the surface

This added leverage barely made Links own struggle a success The
halfdrowned man regained his footing Floundering waistdeep in water
he clambered up the steeply shelving bank to shore There at the roads
edge he lay gasping and sputtering and fighting for breath

Chum had been pulled under and out of his depth by Links exertions
Now coming to the surface he swam to shore and trotted up the bank to
the road Absurdly lank and small with his soaking coat plastered
close to his slim body he stood over his prostrate master

The dogs quick glare up and down the road told him his foes were gone
His incredible sense of hearing registered the faroff padpadpad of
fastretreating human feet and showed him the course the two men were
taking He would have liked to give chase It had been a good
fightlively and exciting withaland Chum wished he might carry it
into the enemies own country

But his god was lying helpless at his feet and making queer sounds of
distress The dogs place was here The joy of battle must be foregone

Solicitously Chum leaned over Ferris and sought to lick the sufferers
face As he did so his supersensitive nostrils were smitten by an odor
which caused the collie to shrink back in visible disgust The sickly
pungent smell of whisky on Ferriss labored breath nauseated Chum He
stood head recoiled looking down at Link in bewilderment

There were many things this night which Chum did not understand
First of all he had been grieved and offended that Ferris should have
locked him in the kitchen instead of taking him along as usual on his
evening stroll It had been lonely in the unlighted kitchen Link had
not ordered the dog to stay there He had simply shut Chum in and left
him

So tiring at last of solitude the collie had leaped lightly out of
the nearest window The window had been open Its thin mosquito net
covering had not served in the least as a deterrent to the departing
Chum

To pick up his masters trailand to hold to it even when it merged
with a score of others at the edge of the villagehad been absurdly
simple The trail had led to a house with closed doors So after
circling the tavern to find if his master had gone out by any other
exit Chum had curled himself patiently on the doorstep and had waited
for Link to emerge

Several people had come in and out while he lay there But all of them
had shut the door too soon for him to slip inside

At last Ferris had appeared between his two new friends Chum had been
friskily happy to see his longabsent god again He had sprung forward
to greet Link Then his odd collie sense had told him that for some
reason this staggering and hiccuping creature was not the master whom
he knew and loved This man was strangely different from the Link
Ferris whom Chum knew

Puzzled the dog had halted and had stood irresolute As he stood
there Ferris had stumbled heavily over him hurting the collies ribs
and his tender flesh and had meandered on without so much as a word or
a look for his pet

Chum still irresolute and bewildered had followed at a distance the
swaying progress of the trio until Links yell and the attack had
brought him in furious haste to Ferriss rescue

Link presently recovered enough of his breath to enable him to move
The ducking in icy water had cleared his bemused brain Approximately
sober he got to his feet and stood swaying and dazed As he rose his
groping hand closed over something cold and hard that had fallen to the
ground beside him And he recognized it So he picked it up and stuck
it into his pocket

It was a pint flask of whiskyone he had received as a farewell gift
from his two friends as the three had left the tavern It had been an
easy gift for the men to make For they were confidently certain of
recovering it a few minutes later when they should go through their
victims clothes Dawning intelligence told Link he had not come
through the adventure very badly after allthanks to Chum Ferris
well understood now why the thieves had picked acquaintance with him at
sight of his money and why they had gotten him drunk

The memory of what he had escaped gave him a new qualm of nausea The
loss of his cash would have meant suspended credit at the store and the
leanest three months he had ever known

But soon the joy in his triumph wiped out this thought

The native North Jersey mountaineer has a peculiar vein of cunning
which makes him morbidly eager to get the best of anyone at alleven
if the victory brings him nothing worth while

Link Ferris had had an evening of limitless liquor He still had a pint
of whisky to take home And it had cost him not a cent except for his
first two rounds of drinks

He had had his spree He still had all his check money And he had a
flask of whisky True he had been roughly handled And he had had a
ducking in the lake But those were his sole liabilities They were
insignificant by comparison to his assets

He grinned in smug selfgratulation Then his eye fell on Chum
standing ten feet away looking uncertainly at him

Chum To Chum he owed it all He owed the dog his money perhaps his
very life Yesas he rehearsed the struggle to get out of the lakehe
owed the collie his life as well as his victory over the holdup men To
Chum

A great wave of love and gratitude surged up in Ferris He had a
sloppily idiotic yearning to throw his arms about the dogs furry neck
and kiss him But he steadied himself and chirped to the collie to
come nearer Slowly with queer reluctance Chum obeyed

Listen mumbled Link incoherently I saved you from dying from a
bust leg and hunger the night I fust met you Chummie An tonight you
squared the bill by saving me from drownin But Im still a whole lot
in your debt friend I owe you for all the cash in my pocket anan
for a pint of the Stuff that Killed Fatheranan maybe for a
beatin that might of killed me Chum I guess God did a real days
work when He built you IILet it go at that Only I aint
forgettin Nor yet I aint lible to forget Come on home Im
agittin the chatters

He had been stroking the oddly unresponsive dogs head as he spoke
Now for the first time Link realized that the night was cool that
his drenched clothes were like ice on him and that the cold and the
shock reaction were giving him a sharp congestive chill Walking fast
to restore circulation to his numbed body he made off for his distant
farmhouse Chum pattering along at his heels

The rapid walk set him into a glow But by the time he had reached home
and had stripped off his wet clothes and swathed himself in a rough
blanket his racked nerves reasserted themselves He craved a drinka
number of drinksto restore his wonted poise Lighting the kitchen
lamp he set the whisky bottle on the table and put a thick tumbler
alongside it Chum was lying at his masters feet In front of Ferris
was a pint of good cheer The lamplight made the kitchen bright and
cozy Link felt a sense of utter wellbeing pervade him

This was homethis was the real thing Three successive and mansize
drinks of whisky presently made it seem more and more the real thing
They made all things seem possible and most things highly desirable
Link wanted to sing And after two additional drinks he gratified this
taste by lifting his voice in a hiccuppunctuated ditty addressed to
one Jenny whom the singer exhorted to wait till the clouds rolled by

He was following this appeal by a rural lyric which recited in somewhat
wearisome tonal monotony the adventures of a Little Black Bull that
came Over the Mountain when he observed that Chum was no longer lying
at his feet Indeed the dog was in a far corner of the room pressed
close to the closed outer door and with crest and ruff adroop

Puzzled by his pets defection Link imperiously commanded Chum to
return to his former place The collie in most unwilling obedience
turned about and came slowly toward the drinker

Every line of Chums splendid body told of reluctance to approach his
master The deepset dark eyes were eloquent of a frightened disgust
He looked at Ferris as at some loathely stranger The glad light of
loyalty which always had transfigured his visage when Link called to
him was woefully lacking Drunk as he was Ferris could not help
noticing the change And he marveled at it

Whasser matter he demanded truculently What ails yer Cm here
Im tellin you

He stretched out his hand in rough caress to the slowly approaching
collie Chum shrank back from the touch as a child from a dose of
castor oil There was no fear now in his aspect Only disgust and a
poignant unhappiness

And all suddenly Link Ferris understood

He himself did not know how the knowledge came to him A canine
psychologist might perhaps have told him that there is always an occult
telepathy between the mind of a thoroughbred dog and its master a
power which gives them a glimpse into each others processes of
thought But there was no such psychologist there to explain the thing
Nor did Link need it explained It was enough for him that he knew

He knew as by revelation that his adoring dog now shunned him because
Link was drunk

From the first Chums look of utter worship and his eagerly happy
obedience had been a joy to Link The subtly complete change in his
worshipers demeanor jarred sharply on the mans raw nerves He felt
vaguely uncleanshamed

The contempt of such of his pious human neighbors as had passed him in
the road during his sprees had affected Link not at all Nor now could
he understand the queer feeling of humiliation that swept over him at
sight of the horrified repugnance in the eyes of this mere brute beast
It roused him to a gust of hot vexation

Shamed of me are you he grunted fiercely A dirty fourlegged
critters shamed of a heman hey Well well lick that out of you
dam soon

Lurching to his feet he snatched up a broom handle He waved it
menacingly over the dog Chum gave back not an inch Under the threat
of a beating he stood his ground his brave eyes steadfast and
lurking in their mystic depths that same glint of sorrowful wonder and
disgust

Up whirled the broomstick But when it fell it did not smite athwart
the shoulders of the sorrowing dog Instead it clattered harmlessly to
the board floor And to the floor also slumped Link Ferris his nerve
all gone his heart soggy with sudden remorse

To his knees thudded the man close beside the collie From Links
throat were bursting great strangled sobs which tortured his whole body
and made his speech a tangled jumble that was not pretty to hear

Chum he wailed brokenly clutching the dogs huge ruff in both shaky
hands Chum old friend Gawd forgive me You saved me from drowndin
an from goin broke this night You been the only friend that ever
cared a hang if I was alive or dead Anan I was goin to lick you
I was goin to lambaste you Because I was a beastlier beast than YOU
be I was goin to do it because you was so much better than me that
you was made sick by my bein a hawg An I was mad at you fer it
Imoh Im shameder than you are Chum Honest to Gawd I am Wont
you make friends again PLEASE Chum

Now of course this was a most ridiculous and maudlin way to talk
Moreover no man belongs on his knees beside a dog even though the man
be a sot and the dog a thoroughbred In his calmer moments Link Ferris
would have known this A highbred collie too has no use for sloppy
emotion but shuns its exhibition wellnigh as disgustedly as he shuns
a drunkard

Yet for some illogical reason Chum did not seek to withdraw his
aristocratic self from the shivering clutch of the repentant souse
Instead the expression of misery and repugnance fled as if by magic
from his brooding eyes Into them in its place leaped a light of keen
solicitude He pressed closer to the swayingly kneeling man and with
upthrust muzzle sought to kiss the blubbering face

The whisky reek was as strong as ever But something in Chums soul was
stronger He seemed to know that the maudlin Unknown had vanished and
that his dear master was back againhis dear master who was in
grievous trouble and who must be comforted

Wherefore the sickening liquor fumes no longer held him aloof from
Link Just as the icy lake had not deterred him from springing into the
water after his drowning god although like most collies Chum hated
to swim

Link through his own nervous collapse recognized the instant change
in Chums demeanor and read it aright It strengthened the old bond
between himself and the dog It somehow gave him a less scornful
opinion of himself

Presently he got to his feet and with the collie at his side went back
to the table where stood the threepartsempty flask His face working
Link opened the window and poured what was left of the whisky out on
the ground There was nothing dramatic about his action Rather it was
tinged by very visible regret Turning back to Chum he said sheepishly

There it goes An I aint sayin Im tickled at wastin such good
stuff Butsomehow I guess weve come to a showdown Chum you an me
If I stick to booze Im lible to see you looking at me that queer way
an sidlin away from me all the time till maybe at last youd get
plumb sick of me for keeps an light out AnId rather have YOU
than the booze since I cant have both of you Bein only a dawg and
never havin tasted good red liquor you cant know what a big bouquet
Im athrowin at you when I say that neither IOh lets call it a
day and go to sleep


Next morning in the course of nature Link Ferris worked with a
splitting headache He carried it and a bad taste in his mouth for the
best part of the day

But it was the last drink headache which marred his labor all that
long and happy summer His work showed the results of the change So
did the meager hill farm So did Links system and his pocketbook

As he was a real live human and not a temperance tract hero there
were times when he girded bitterly at his selfenforced abstinence
Where were times toowhen he had a touch of malaria and again when
the cutworms slaughtered two rows of his early tomatoeswhen he
yearned unspeakably for the solace of an evening at the Hampton tavern

He had never been a natural drinker Like many a better man he had
drunk less for what he sought to get than for what he sought to forget
And with the departure of loneliness and the new interest in his home
he felt less the need for wet conviviality and for drugging his fits of
melancholy

The memory of Chums grieving repulsion somehow stuck in Ferriss mind
And it served as a brake more than once to his tavernward impulses
Two or three times also when Links babyish gusts of destructive bad
temper boiled to the surface at some setback or annoyance much the
same wonderingly distressed look would creep into the collies
glancea look as of one who is revolted by a dear friends failure to
play up to form And to his own amused surprise Ferris found himself
trying to curb these outbursts

To the average human a dog is only a dog To Ferris this collie of
his was the one intimate friend of his life Unversed in the ways of
dogs he overestimated Chum of course and valued his society and his
good opinion far more highly than the average man would have done
Thus perhaps his desire to stand well in the dogs esteem had in it
more that was commendable than ludicrous Or perhaps not

If the strange association did much for Link it did infinitely more
for Chum He had found a master who had no social interests in life
beyond his dog and who could and did devote all his scant leisure
hours to association with that dog Chums sagacity and individuality
blossomed under such intensive tutelage as might that of a clever
child who is the sole pupil of its teacher

Link did not seek to make a trick dog of his pet He taught Chum to
shake hands to lie down to speak and one or two more simple
accomplishments It was by talking constantly to the collie as to a
fellow human that he broadened the dogs intelligence Chum grew to
know and to interpret every inflection of Ferriss voice every simple
word he spoke and every gesture of his

Apart from mere good fellowship the dog was proving of great use on the
farm Morning and night Chum drove the sheep and the cattle to their
respective pastures and then back to the barnyard at night At the
entrances to the pastures now Ferris had rigged up rude gates with
bar catch fasteningssimple contrivances which closed by gravity and
whose bars the dog was readily taught to shove upward with his nose

It was thus a matter of only a few days to teach Chum to open or close
the light gates This trick has been taught to countless collies of
course in Great Britain and to many here But Link did not know that
He felt like another Columbus or Edison at his own genius in devising
such a scheme and he felt an inordinate pride in Chum for learning the
simple exploit so quickly

Of old Link had fretted at the waste of time in taking out the sheep
and cows and in going for them at night This dual duty was now a thing
of the past Chum did the work for him and reveled in the excitement
of it Chum alsofrom watching Link perform the task twicehad
learned to drive the chickens out of the garden patches whenever any of
them chanced to stray thither and to scurry into the cornfield with
harrowing barks of ejection when a flock of crows hovered hungrily
above the newlyplanted crops

All of which was continual amusement to Chum and a tremendous help to
his owner

Link getting over his initial wonder at the dogs progress began to
take these accomplishments as a matter of course Indeed he was
sometimes perplexed at the otherwise sagacious dogs limitations of
brain

For example Chum loved the fire on the chilly evenings such as creep
over the mountain region even in midsummer He would watch Link
replenish the blaze with fresh sticks whenever it sank low

Yet left to himself he would let the fire go out and he never knew
enough to pick up a stick in his mouth and lay it on the embers This
lack of reasoning powers in his pet perplexed Ferris

Link could not understand why the same wit which sent Chum half a mile
of his own accord in search of one missing sheep out of the entire
flock should not tell him that a fire is kept alive by the putting of
wood on it

In search of some better authority on dog intelligence Link paid his
first visit to Hamptons little public library There shamefacedly he
asked the boy in charge for some books about dogs The youth looked
idly for a few minutes in a crossindex file Then he brought forth a
tome called The Double Garden written by someone who was evidently
an Eyetalian or Polack or other foreigner because he bore the
grievously unAmerican name of Maeterlinck

This is all I can find about dogs explained the boy passing the
linenjacketed little volume across the counter to Link First story
in it is an essay on Our Friend the Dog the index says Want it

That evening by his kitchen lamp Ferris read laboriously the Belgian
philosophers dog essay He read it aloudas he had taken to thinking
aloudfor Chums benefit And there were many parts of the immortal
essay from which the man gleaned no more sense than did the collie

It began with a promising account of a puppy named Pelleas But midway
it branched off into something else Something Link could not make head
nor tail of Then on second reading bits of Maeterlincks meaning
here and there seeped into Ferriss bewilderedly groping intellect

He learned among other things that Man is all alone on earth that
most animals dont know he is here and that the rest of them have no
use for him That even flowers and crops will desert him and run again
to wildness if Man turns his back on them for a minute So will his
horse his cow and his sheep They graft on him for a living and they
hate or ignore him

The dog alone Link spelled out has pierced the vast barrier between
humans and other beasts and has ranged himself willingly and
joyously on the side of Man For Mans sake the dog will not only
starve and suffer and lay down his life but will betray his fellow
quadrupeds Man is the dogs god And the dog is the only living mortal
that has the privilege of looking upon the face of his deity

All of which was doubtless very interesting and part of which thrilled
Ferris but none of which enlightened him as to a dogs uncanny wisdom
in certain things and his blank stupidity in others Next day Link
returned the book to the library no wiser than before albeit with a
higher appreciation of his own good luck in being the god of one
splendid dog like Chum


July had drowsed into August and August was burning its sultry way
toward September Links quarterly check from the Paterson Market
arrived And Ferris went as usual to the Hampton store to get it
cashed This tine he stood in less dire need of moneys lifesaving
qualities than of yore It had been a good summer for Link The liquor
out of his system and with a new interest in life he had worked with a
snap and vigor which had brought results in hard cash

None the less he was glad for this check In another month the annual
interest on his farm mortgage would fall due And the meeting of that
payment was always a problem This year he would be less cruelly
harassed by it than before

Yet all the more he desired extra money For a startlingly original
ambition had awakened recently in his heartnamely to pay off a
little of the mortgages principal along with the interest

At first the idea had staggered him But talking it over with Chum and
studying his thumbedsoiled ledger he had decided there was a bare
chance he might be able to do it

As he mounted the steps of the store this evening in late August he
saw tacked to the doorside clapboards a truly gorgeous poster By the
light of the flickering lamp over the door he discerned the vivid
scarlet head of a dog in the upper corner of the yellow placard and
much display type below it

It was the picture of the dog which checked Link in passing It was a
fancy headthe head of a stately and long muzzled dog with a ruff and
with tulip ears In short just such a dog as Chum Not knowing that
Chum was a collie and that poster artists rejoice to depict collies by
reason of the latters decorative qualities Ferris was amazed by the
coincidence

After a long and critical survey of the picture he was moved to run
his eye over the flaring reading matter

The poster announced to all and sundry that on Labor Day a mammoth
dog show was to be held in the country club grounds at Craigswolda
show for the benefit of the Red Cross Entries were to be one dollar
for each class Thanks to generous contributions the committee was
enabled to offer prizes of unusual beauty and value in addition to the
customary ribbons

Followed a list of cups and medals Link scanned them with no great
interest But suddenly his roving gaze came to an astonished
standstill At the bottom of the poster in fortyeightpoint boldface
type ran the following proclamation

 COL CYRUS MARDEN
 OF CRAIGSWOLD MANOR
 OFFERS A CASH AWARD OF
 ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS 100 TO THE
 BEST DOG OF ANY BREED EXHIBITED

 One hundred dollars

Link reread the glittering sentence until he could have said it
backward It would have been a patent lie had he heard it by word of
mouth But as it was in print of course it was true

One hundred dollars And as a prize for the finest dog in the show Not
to BUY the dog mind you Just as a gift to the man who happened to own
the best dog It did not seem possible Yet

Link knew by hearsay and by observation the ways of the rich colony at
Craigswold He knew the Craigswolders spent money like mud when it so
pleased themalthough more than one fellow huckster was at times sore
put to it to collect from them a bill for fresh vegetables

Yes and he knew Col Cyrus Marden by sight too He was a longfaced
little man who used to go about dressed in funny knee pants and with a
leather bag of misshapen clubs over his shoulder Link had seen him
again and again He had seen the Colonels enormous house at Craigswold
Manor too He had no doubt Marden could afford this gift of a hundred
dollars

TO THE BEST DOG OF ANY BREED

Ferris knew nothing about the various breeds of dogs But he did know
that Chum was by far the best and most beautiful and the wisest dog
ever born If Marden were offering a hundred dollar prize for the best
dog there was not another dog on earth fit to compete with Chum That
was a cinch

As for the hundred dollarswhy it would be a godsend on the mortgage
payment Every cent of it could go toward the principal That meant
Ferris could devote the extra few dollars he had already saved for the
principal to the buying of fertilizers and several sorelyneeded
utensils and to the shingling of the house

Avid for more news of the offer he entered the store and hunted up the
postmaster who also chanced to be the stores proprietor and the mayor
of Hampton and the local peace justice Of this PoohBah the inquiring
Ferris sought for details

Some of the Red Cross ladies from up Craigswold way were here this
morning to have me nail that sign on the store reported the
postmaster Theyre making a tour of all the towns hereabouts They
asked me to try to intrest folks at Hampton in their show too and
get them to make entries They left me a bunch of blanks Want one

Yep said Link I guess Ill take one if it dont cost nothin
please

He studied the proffered entry blank with totally uncomprehending gaze
The postmaster came to his relief

Let me show you he suggested taking pity on his customers wrinkled
brow and squinting helplessness Ive had some experience in this
folderol I took my Airedale over to the Ridgewood show last spring and
got a third with him Im going to take him up to Craigswold on Labor
Day too What kind of dog is yours

The dandiest dawg that ever stood on four legs answered Link afire
with the zeal of ownership Why that dawg of mine cn

What breed is he asked the postmaster not interested in the dawning
rhapsody

Ohbreed repeated Link Why I dont rightly know Some kind of a
bird dawg I guess Yes A bird dawg But hes sure the grandest

Is he the dog you had down here one day last month asked the
postmaster with a gleam of recollection

Yep Thats him assented Link Only dawg Ive got Only dawg I ever
had Only dawg I ever want to have Hes

But the postmaster was not attending His time was limited So taking
out a fountain pen he had begun to scribble on the blank Filling in
Links name and address he wrote in the breed and sex spaces the
words Scotch collie sableandwhite male

Name he queried breaking in on Ferriss rambling eulogy

Huh asked the surprised Link adding Oh his name hey I call him
Chum You see that dawgs more like a chum to me than

No use asking about his pedigree I suppose resumed the postmaster
I mean who his parents were and

Nope said Link II found him His leg was

Pedigree unknown wrote the postmaster then What classes are you
entering him for

Classes repeated Link dully Why I just want to put him into that
contest for best dawg you see He

Hold on interposed the postmaster impatiently You dont catch the
idea In each breed there are a certain number of classes Puppy
Novice Limit Open and so on The dogs that get a blue
ribbonthats first prizein these classes all have to appear in what
is called the Winners Class Then the dog that gets Winnersthe
dog that gets first prize in this Winners Classcompetes for best

all the different breeds are brought into the ring And the dog that
wins in that final class is adjudged the best in the show Hes the
dog in this particular show that will get Colonel Mardens
hundreddollar cash prize See what I mean

Yees replied Link after digesting carefully what he had heard I
guess so But

Since youve never shown your dog before went on the postmaster
beginning to warm with professional interest you can enter him in the
Novice Class Thats generally the easiest If he loses in that no
harms done If he wins he has a chance later in the Winners Class
Im mailing my entry tonight to the committee If you like Ill send
yours along with it Give me a dollar

While Link extracted a greasy dollar bill from his pocket the
postmaster filled in the class space with the word Novice

Thanks for helpin me out said Ferris grateful for the lift

Thats all right returned the postmaster pocketing the bill and
folding the blank as he prepared to end the interview by moving away
Be sure to have your dog at the gate leading into the Craigswold
Country Club grounds promptly at ten oclock on Labor Day If you dont
get a card and a tag sent to you before then tell your name to the
clerk at the table there and hell give you a number Tie your dog to
the stall with that number on it and be sure to have him ready to go
into the ring when his number is called Thats all

Thanks said Link again An now I guess Ill go back home an
commence brightenin Chum up a wee peckle on his tricks Maybe Ill
have time to learn him some new ones too I want him to make a hit
with them judges an everything

Tricks scoffed the postmaster pausing as he started to walk away
Dogs dont need tricks in the show ring All you have to do is to lead
your dog into the ring and parade him round with the rest of them till
the judge tells you to stop Then hell make them stand on the show
platform while he examines them The dogs only tricks are to stand
and walk at his best and to look alert so the judge can see the shape
of his ears and get his expression Teach your dog to walk around with
you on the leash without hanging back and to prick up his ears and
stand at attention when you tell him to Thats all he needs to do The
judge will do the rest Have him clean and well brushed of course

II sure feel bitter sorry for there other dawgs at the show
mumbled Link A hundred dollars Of all the dawgs that ever happened
Chummie is that one Why there aint a thing he cant do from herdin
sheep to winnin a wad of soft money Anan hes all MINE



CHAPTER III

The Ordeal

By dawn on Labor Day Link Ferris was astir A series of discomfiting
baths and repeated currying with the dandy brush had made Chums grand
coat stand out in shimmering fluffiness A course of
carefullyconducted circular promenades on the end of a chain had
taught the dog to walk gaily and unrestrainedly in leash And any of
several cryptic words relating to hypothetical rats and so forth
were quite enough to send up his ears

It was sheer excitement that brought Link broad awake before sunrise on
that day of days Ferris was infected with the most virulent form of
that weird malady known as dogshowitis At first he had been tempted
solely by the hope of winning the hundreddollar prize But latterly
the urge of victory had gotten into his blood And he yearned too to
let the world see what a marvelous dog was his

He hurried through the morning chores then dressed himself in his
shabby best and hitched his horse to the antiquated Concord buggya
vehicle he had been washing for the state occasion almost as vehemently
as he had scrubbed Chum

After a gobbled breakfast Ferris mounted to the seat of the aged
buggy signaled Chum to leap to the battered cushion at his side and
set off for Craigswold Long before ten oclock his horse was safely
stabled at the Craigswold livery and Ferris was leading Chum proudly
through the wicket gate leading into the countryclub grounds

All happened as the postmaster had foretold The clerk at the wicket
asked him his name fumbled through a ledger and a pile of envelopes
and presently handed Ferris a numbered tag

Sixtyfive read the clerk for Links benefit Thats down at the
extreme right Almost the last bench to the right

Into the hallowed precinct Link piloted the muchinterested Chum There
he paused for a dazzled instant The putting green and the forelawn in
front of the fieldstone clubhouse had been covered with a mass of
wooden alleyways each lined with a double row of stalls about two feet
from the ground carpeted with straw and having individual zinc water
troughs in front of them In nearly every one of these benches was
tied a dog

There were more dogs than Link Ferris had seen before in all his
quasidogless life And all of them seemed to be barking or yelping
The din was egregious Along the alleyways men and women in sport
clothes were drifting in survey of the chained exhibits In a central
space among the lines of benches was a large square enclosure roped
off except for one aperture In the middle of this space which Link
rightly guessed to be the judging ring stood a very low wooden
platform At one side of the ring were a chair and a table where sat a
steward in a Palm Beach suit fussily turning over the leaves of a
ledger and assorting a heap of highpacked and varicolored ribbons

Link mindful of instructions bore to the right in search of a stall
labeled 65 As he went he noted that the dogs were benched in such a
way that each breed had a section to itself Thus while he was still
some distance away from his designated bench he saw that he was coming
into a section of dogs which in general aspect resembled Chum Above
this aggregation as over others hung a lettered sign And this
especial sign read Collie Section

So Chum was a colliewhatever that might be Link took it to be a
fancy term for bird dog He had seen the word before somewhere And
he remembered now that it had been in the advertisement that offered
seventyfive dollars for the return of a lost sableandwhite collie
Yes and Dominie Jansen had said sable meant black Link felt a
glow of relief that the advertisement had not said a brownandwhite
collie

Chum was viewing his new surroundings with much attention looking up
now and then into his masters face as they moved along the rackety
lineas though to gain reassurance that all was well

To a highstrung and sensitive dog a show is a terrific ordeal But
Chum like the aristocrat he was bore its preliminaries with debonair
calm

Arriving at Bench 65 in the collie section Link enthroned his dog
there fastening the chains free end to a ring in the stalls corner
Then after seeing that the water pan was where Chum could reach it in
case he were thirsty and that the straw made a comfortable couch for
him Ferris once more patted the worried dog and told him everything
was all right After which Link proceeded to take a survey of the
neighboring collies the sixteen dogs which were to be Chums
competitors

His first appraising glance of the double row of collies caused the
furrow between his eyes to vanish and brought a grin of complacent
satisfaction to his thin lips For he did not see a single entrant
that in his eyes seemed to have a ghost of a chance against his
idolized petnot a dog as handsome or with half the look of
intelligence or with the proudly gay bearing of Chum

Of the sixteen other collies the majority were sables of divers shades
There were three tricolors and two misthued merles Over nearly all
the sections occupants a swarm of owners and handlers were just now
busy with brush and cloth For word had come that collies were to be
the second breed judged that day The first breed was to be the Great
Danes As there were but three Danes in the show their judging would
be brief And it behooved the collies attendants to have their entries
ready

Link following the example of those around him took from his pocket
the molting dandy brush and set to work once more on Chums coat He
observed that the rest were brushing their dogs fur against the grain
to make it fluff up And he reversed his own former process in
imitation of them He had supposed until now that a collies hair like
a mans ought to be slicked down smooth for state occasions And it
troubled him to find that Chums coat rebelled against such treatment
Now under the reverse process it stood out in wavy freedom

At the adjoining stall to the left a decidedly pretty girl was watching
a groom put the finishing touches to the toilet of her tricolor collie
Link heard her exclaim in protest as the groom removed from the dogs
collar a huge cerise bow she had just affixed there

Sorry Miss Ferris heard the groom explain but its agin rules for
a dog to go in the ring with a ribbon on If the judge thinks hes good
enough for a ribbon hell award him one But

Oh he simply cant help awarding one to Morven here broke in the
girl CAN he Stokes

Hard to say Miss answered the groom imperturbably as he wrought
with brush and cloth Judges has their own ideas Well have to hope
for the best for him and not be too sick if he gets gated

Gated echoed the girlan evident newcomer to the realm of showdom

Yes Miss expounded the groom Gated means shown the gate Some
judges thins out a class that way by sending the poorest dogs out of
the ring first Then again some judges

Oh Im glad I wore this dress sighed the girl It goes so well
with Morvens color Perhaps the judge

Excuse me Miss put in the groom trying not to laugh but the
collie judge today is Fred Leightonhe bred the great Howgill Rival
you knowand when Leighton is in the ring he hasnt got eyes for
anything but the dogs themselves Begging your pardon he wouldnt
notice if you was to wear a horse blanket At that Leightons the
squarest and the best

Look whispered the girl whose attention had wandered and whose
roving gaze had settled on Chum Look at that dog in the next bench
Isnt he magnificent

Link swelled with pride at the lowspoken praise And turning away to
hide his satisfaction he saw that quite a sizable knot of spectators
had gathered in front of Chums bench They were inspecting the collie
with manifest approval Chum embarrassed by the unaccustomed notice
had moved as far as possible from his admirers and was nuzzling his
head into Ferriss hand for refuge

Puppy Class Male Scotch Collies droned a ring attendant appearing
for a moment at the far end of the section Numbers 60 61 62

Three youngsters ranging in age from seven to eleven months were
coaxed down from their straw couches by three excited owners and were
convoyed fussily toward the ring

Novice Class next Miss Link heard the groom saying to the girl at
the adjoining bench Got his ring leash ready

Ring leash This was a new one to Ferris His eyes followed the trio
of puppies shuffling ringward He saw that all three were on leather
leashes and that their chains had been left in the stalls Presumably
there was a law against chains in the ring And Link had no leash

For an instant he was in a quandary Then his brow cleared True he
had no leash Yet if chains like bows of ribbon were barred from the
ring he could maneuver Chum every bit as well with his voice as with
any leash So that problem was solved

A minute later the three pups reappeared at the end of the section
And behind them came the attendant intoning

Novice Class Male Scotch Collies Numbers 64 65 66 67

There was an absurd throbbing in Link Ferriss meridian His calloused
hands shook as he unchained Chum and motioned him to leap from the
bench to the ground

Chum obeyed but with evident uneasiness His odd surroundings were
getting on the collies nerves Link bent over him under pretense of
giving him a farewell rub with the brush

Its all right Chummie he crooned soothingly Its all RIGHT Im
here An nobodys goin to bother you none Youre ahelpin me win
that hundred An youre lettin these goldshirt folks see what a
clam gorgeous dawg you be Come along ol friend

Under the comfort of his gods voice Chums nervousness fled Safe in
his sublime trust that his master would let no harm befall him the
collie trotted toward the ring at Ferriss heels

Three other novice dogs were already in the ring when Link arrived at
the narrow opening The steward was sitting at the table as before At
the corner of the ring alongside the platform stood a man in tweeds
unlighted pipe in mouth halfshut shrewd eyes studying the dogs as
they filed in through the gap in the ropes The inscrutable eyes
flickered ever so little at sight of Chum but at once resumed their
former disinterested gaze

Walk close whispered Link as the parade started

Chum hearing a command he had long since learned ranged himself at
Ferriss side and paced majestically in the procession of four Two of
the other novice dogs were straining at their leashes the third was
hanging back and pawing frantically to break away Chum unleashed
guided only by the voice drew every eye to him by his rare beauty and
his lofty selfpossession

But he was not allowed to finish the parade Stepping up to Ferris
Judge Leighton tapped him on the arm

Take your dog over to that corner he ordered and keep him there

Link fought back a yearning to punch the judge and surlily he obeyed
the mandate Into his memory jumped the things the groom had said about
a dog being gated If that judge thought for one second that any of
those mutts could hold a candle to Chum Again he yearned to enforce
with his two willing fists his opinion of the judge

But as he well knew to start a fight in this plutocratic assemblage
would mean a jail term And in such case what would befall the
deserted Chum For the dogs sake he restrained himself and he began
to edge surreptitiously toward the ring exit with a view to sliding
out unperceived with his splendid underrated dog

But Ferris did not reach the gate unchecked

Judge Leighton had ended the parade and had stood the three dogs one
by one and then two at a time on the platform while he studied them
Then he had crossed to the table and picked up the judging book and
four ribbonsone blue one red one yellow and one white Three of
these ribbons he handed to the three contestants handlers

Then he stepped across the ring to where Ferris was edging his way
toward the exit and handed Link the remaining ribbon It was dark
blue with gilt lettering

Leighton did not so much as subject Chum to the handling and close
inspection he had lavished on the three others One expert glance had
told the judge that the darksable collie led by this loutish
countryman was better fitted to clean up prizes at Madison Square
Garden than to appear in a society dog show in the North Jersey
hinterland

Leighton had viewed Chum as a bored musician listening to the
pianoantics of defective children might have regarded the playing of
a disguised Paderewski Wherefore he had waved the dog to one side
while he judged the lesser entrants and then had given him the merited
firstprize ribbon

Link in a daze of bliss stalked back to the bench with Chum capering
along at his side The queer sixth sense of a collie told Chum his god
was deliriously happy and that Chum himself had somehow had a share in
making him so Hence the dogs former gloomy pacing changed to a series
of ecstatic little dance steps and he kept thrusting his cold muzzle
into the cup of Ferriss palm

Again Bench 65 was surrounded by an admiring clump of spectators Chum
and Link vied each other in their icy aloofness toward these admirers
But with a difference

Chum was unaffectedly bothered by so much unwelcome attention from
strangers Ferris on the other hand reveled in the knowledge that his
beloved pet was the center of more adulation than was any other dog in
all the section

Class after class went to be judged Link was sorry he had not spent
more money and entered Chum in every class The initial victory had
gone to his head He had not known he could be so serenely happy After
a while he started up at the attendants droning announcement of

Winners Class Male Scotch Collies Numbers 62 65 6870 73

Again Link and Chum set out for the ring Links glee had merged into
an allconsuming nervousness comparable only to a maiden hunters
buck ague Chum once more sensing Ferriss state of mind lost his
own glad buoyancy and paced solemnly alongside peering worriedly up
into Links face at every few steps

All five entrants filed into the ring and began their parade Leighton
in view of the importance of this crowning event did not single out
any one dog as before to stand to one side nor did he gate any He
gave owners and spectators their full due by a thorough inspection of
all five contestants But as a result of his examination he ended the
suspense by handing Link Ferris a purple rosette whereon was blazoned
in gilt the legend Winners

A salvo of handclaps greeted the eminently just decision And Chum left
the ring to find a score of gratulatory hands stretched forth to pat
him Quite a little crowd escorted him back to his bench

A dozen people picked acquaintance with Link They asked him all sorts
of questions as to his dog Link made monosyllabic and noncommittal
replies to all of theseeven when the great Col Cyrus Marden himself
deigned to come over to the collie section and stare at Chum
accompanying his scrutiny with a volley or patronizing inquiries

From the bystanders Link learned something of real interestnamely
that one of the specials was a big silver cup to be awarded to best
collie of either sex and that after the females should have been
judged the winning female and Chum must appear in the ring together to
compete for this trophy

Sure enough in less than thirty minutes Chum was summoned to the ring
There awaiting him was a dainty and temperamental merle of the
Tazewell strain Exquisite and highbred as was this female competitor
Judge Leighton wasted little time on the examination before giving
Ferris a tricolored ribbon whose possession entitled him to one of the
shimmering silver mugs in the nearby trophy case

After receiving full assurance that the big cup should be his at the
close of the show Link returned to Chums bench in ecstasy and sat
down beside his tired dog with one arm thrown lovingly round the
collies ruff Chum nestled against his triumphant master as Link
fondled his bunch of ribbons and went over mentally every move of his
triumphal morning

The milling and changing groups of spectators in front of Bench 65 did
not dwindle Indeed as the morning went on they increased People
kept coming back to the bench and bringing others with them Some of
these people whispered together Some merely stared and went away Some
asked Ferris carefully worded questions to which the shyly happy
mountaineer replied with sheepish grunts

The long period of judging came at last to an end And the Best Dog in
Show special was called

Into the ring Ferris escorted Chum amid a multitude of fellow winners
representing one male or female of every breed exhibited Leighton and
another judge stood in the rings center and around them billowed the
heterogeneous array The two went at their Gargantuan task with an
expert swiftness Mercilessly dog after dog was weeded out and gated
At last Chum and two others were all remaining of the many which had
thronged the ring The spectators were banked five deep and
breathless round the ropes

The two judges went into brief executive session in one corner Then
Leighton crossed to Link for the fourth time that day and gave him
the gaudy rosette which proclaimed Chum best dog in the show A roar
of applause went up Link felt dizzyand numb Then with a gasp of
rapture he stooped and gathered the bored Chum in his long arms in a
bearlike ecstatic hug

We done it Chummie he chortled WE DONE IT

Still in a daze he followed the steward to the trophy case where he
received not only the shining silver cup but a sovereign purse
wherein were ensconced ten tendollar gold pieces

It was all a dreama wonder dream from which presently he must awaken
Link was certain of that But while the golden dream lasted he knew
the nameless joys of paradise

Chum close at his side he made his way through the congratulating
crowd toward the outer gate of the country club grounds He had almost
reached the wicket when someone touched him with unnecessary firmness
on the shoulder

Not relishing the familiarity Link turned a scowling visage on the
interrupter of his triumphal homeward progress At his elbow stood a
stockilybuilt man dressed with severe plainness

Youre Lincoln Ferris queried the stranger more as if stating
aggressively a fact than making an inquiry

Yep said Link cross at this annoying breakin upon his trance of
happiness What dj want he added

Please step back to the clubhouse a minute with me returned the
stranger civilly enough but with the same bossy firmness in his tone
that had jarred Ferris in his touch One or two people want to speak
to you Bring along your dog

Link glowered He fancied he knew what was in store Some of the ultra
select had gathered in the holy interior of the clubhouse and wanted a
private view of Chum unsullied by the noisy presence of the crowd
outside They would talk patronizingly to Link and perhaps even try to
coax him into selling Chum The thought decided Ferris

Im goin home he said roughly

Youre coming with me contradicted the man in that same quiet voice
but slipping his muscular arm into Links

With his other hand he shifted the lapel of his coat displaying a
police badge on its reverse Still avoiding any outward appearance of
force he turned about with his arm locked in Ferriss and started
toward the clubhouse

Here expostulated poor Link with all a true mountaineers horror of
the police Whats all this I aint broke no law I

An ugly growl from Chum punctuated his scared plea Noting the terror
in his masters tone and the grip of the stranger on Links arm Chum
had spun round to face the two

The collies eyes were fixed grimly upon the plainclothes mans
temptingly thick throat One corner of Chums upper lip was curled
back displaying a businesslike if snowy fang His head was lowered
Deep in his furry throat a succession of legato growls were born

The plainclothes man knew much about dogs He knew for example that
when a dog holds his head high and barks there is no special danger to
be feared from him But he also knew that when a dog lowers his head
and growls showing his eyetooth he means business

And the man shrank from the menace One hand crept back instinctively
toward his hip pocket

Link saw the purely involuntary gesture and he shook in his boots It
was thus a Hampton constable had once reached back when a stray cur
snapped at him And that constable had completed the movement by
drawing a pistol and shooting the cur Perhaps this nonuniformed
stranger meant to do the same thing

Hold on begged Link intervening between the man and the dog Ill
go along with you peaceful Quit Chum Its all right

The dog still looked undecided He did not like this new note in his
gods voice But he obeyed the injunction and fell into step at Links
side as usual Ferris suffered himself to be piloted unresisting
through the tattered remnant of the crowd and up the clubhouse steps

There his conductor led him through the sacred portals and down a wide
hallway to the door of a committee room Throwing open the door he
ushered in his captive and the dog entering behind them and reclosing
the heavy door

In the room round a table sat several personsall men except one
The exception was the girl whose collie had had the bench next to
Chums At the table head looking very magisterial indeed sat Colonel
Marden Beside him lounged a larger and older man in a plaid sport suit

Links escort ranged his prisoners at the foot of the table Chum
standing tight against Ferriss knee as if to guard him from possible
harm Link stood glowering in sullen perplexity at the Colonel Marden
cleared his voice pompously then spoke

Ferris he began with much impressiveness I am a magistrate of this
countyas you perhaps know You may consider yourself before the Bar
of Justice and reply to my questions accordingly

Awed by this thundered preamble Ferris made shift to mutter

I aint broke no laws What dj want of me anyhow

First of all proceeded Marden where did you get that dog

Chum here said Ferris Why I come acrost him early last spring
on the patch of state road jes outside of Hampton He was alayin in
a ditch with his leg bust Throwed offn a auto I figgered it I took
him home an

He paused as the sportsuited man next to Marden nodded excitedly to
the girl and then whispered to the Colonel

You took him home pursued Marden Couldnt you see he was a
valuable dog

I cd see he was a sufferin an dyin dawg retorted Link I cd
see he was a goner less I took him home an tended him If youre
aimin at findin out why I went on keepin him after that I done so
because no one claimed him I put up notices bout him I put one up at
the postoffice here too I

He did interrupted the girl Thats true I saw it Onlythe
notice said it was a bird dog Thats why we didnt follow it up He

Miss Gault suggested Marden in lofty reproof suppose you leave the
interrogatory to me if you please Yes I recollect that notice My
attention was called to it at the time But again addressing Link
why did you call Glenmuir Cavalier a BIRD dog Was it to throw us
off the track or

Dont know no WhatsHisName Cavlier snapped Ferris This dawgs
name is Chum Like you cn see in my entry blank whats layin on the
table in front of you I advtised Chum as a bird dawg because I
sposed he WAS a bird dawg I aint a sharp on dawgs Hes the fust one
ever I had If he aint a bird dawg taint my fault He looks more
like one than like tother breeds Id seen So I called him one

There is no need to raise your voice at me rebuked the colonel I
am disposed to accept your explanation But if you read the local
papers you must have seen

I did read em said Ferris I read em steady for a month or more
to see was there was advtisement fer a lost dawg Nary an advtisement
did I see excep one fer a sable collie Sable means black I
know because our dominie told me so I asked him when I see that
piece in the paper Chum aint black nor nowheres near black So I
knowed it couldnt be him What dj want of me anyhow he demanded
once more

Again I am disposed to credit your explanation boomed the colonel
frowning down a ripple of giggles that had its rise in Miss Gault And
I am disposed to acquit you of consciously dishonest intent I am glad
to do so Here is the situation Early last spring Mr Gault
indicating the sportsuit wearer at his left bought from the famous
Glenmuir Collie Kennels on the Hudson an unusually fine young
colliea dog for which connoisseurs predicted a great future in the
show ring He purchased it as a gift for his daughter Miss Marion
Gault

He inclined his head slightly toward the girl then proceeded

As Mr Glenmuir was disbanding his kennel Mr Gault was able to
secure the dogGlenmuir Cavalier He started for Craigswold with the
dog on the rear seat of the car At first he kept a hand on the dogs
collar but as the collie made no attempt to escape he soon turned
aroundhe was in the front seatand paid no more attention to him
Just outside of Suffern he looked backto find Cavalier had
disappeared He advertised and made all possible efforts to locate the
dog But he could get no clew to him until today Seeing this dog of
yours in the show ring he recognized him at once

The pompously booming voice with its stilted diction ceased All eyes
were upon Link Ferris The mountaineer stung to life by the silence
and the multiple gaze came out of his trance of shock

Thenthen he stuttered forcing the words from a throat sanded by
sudden dread then Chum rightly blongs to this man

Quite so assented Marden in some relief I am glad you grasp the
point so readily Mr Gault has talked the matter over with me and he
is taking a remarkably broad and generous view of the case if I may say
so He is not only willing that you should keep the cup and the cash
prize which you have won today but he is also ready to pay to you the
seventyfive dollar reward he offered for the return of Glenmuir
Cavalier I repeat this strikes me as most gener

NO yelled Link a spasm of foreseen loneliness sweeping over him
NO He cant have him Nobody can Why Chums my dawg Ive learned
him to fetch cows an shake hands anan everything An he drug me
outn the lake when I was adrowndin An he done a heap moren that
fer me Hes drug me up to my feet outn wuthlessness too an hes
learned me that livin is wuth while Hes mymyhes my dawg he
finished lamely his scared eyes sweeping the circle of faces in panic
appeal

That will do Ferris coldly exhorted the colonel We wish no scenes
here You will take this seventyfive dollar check which Mr Gault has
so kindly made out for you and you will go

Leavin Chum behind babbled Ferris aghast Not leavin Chum
behind PLEASE not

He pulled himself together with an effort that drove his nails bitingly
into his palms and left his face gray He saw the uselessness of
pleading with these people of polished iron who could not understand
his fearful loss For the sake of Chumfor the sake of the
selfrespecting man he himself had becomehe would not let himself go
to pieces Forcing his shaken voice to a dry steadiness he addressed
the uneasily squirming Gault

What dj you pay for Chum when you bought him offn that Hudson River
fellerthat Glenmuir chap he demanded

Why as a matter of fact responded Gault as Colonel Marden has
told you I couldnt have hoped to get such a promising collie at any
price it

What dj you pay for him insisted Link his voice harsh and
unconsciously domineering as a vague new hope dawned on his troubled
mind

I paid six hundred dollars answered Gault shortly in annoyance at
the boors manner

Good approved Link That gives us suthin to go on Ill pay you
six hundred dollars fer him back This hundred dollars in gold an this
yer silver cup an seven dollars more I got with meto bind the
bargain An a second mortgage on my farm fer the rest Fer as much of
the rest he amended as I aint got ready cash for

In his stark earnestness Links rough voice sounded more hectoring and
unpleasant than before Gault unused to such talk from the alleged
peasantry resolved to cut short the haggling

Sell for six hundred a dog thats cleaned up best in the show he
rasped No thank you Leighton says Cavalier will go far One man
ten minutes ago offered me a thousand for him

A thousan repeated Ferris scared at the magnitude of the
sumthen rallying he asked

What WILL you let me have him fer then Set a price cant you

The dog is not for sale curtly replied Gault busying himself with
the lighting of a cigarette

Take Mr Gaults check and go commanded Marden thrusting the slip
of paper at Link I think there is nothing more to say I have an
appointment at

He hesitated Regardless of the others presence Ferris dropped to one
knee beside the uncomprehending dog With his arm about Chums neck he
bent close to the collies ear and whispered

Goodby Chummie Its goodby fer keeps too Dont you get to
thinkin Ive gone an deserted you nor got tired of you nor nothnn
Chum Because Id a dam sight ruther leave one of my two legs here
than to leave you II guess only Gawd rightly knows all you done fer
me Chum But I aint agoin to ferget none of it Lord but its
goin to be pretty turrible to home without you He got to his feet
winking back a mist from his red eyes and turning blindly toward the
door

Here boomed Marden after him Youve forgotten your check

I dont aim to take no measly money fer givin up the only friend I
got snarled Link over his shoulder Keep itfer a tip

It was a good exit line But it was spoiled Because as Ferris reached
the door and groped for its knob Chum was beside himglad to get out
of this uncongenial assembly and to be alone with the master who seemed
so unhappy and so direly in need of consolation Link stiffened to his
full height With one hand lovingly laid on the collies silken head
he mumbled

No Chum you cant come along Back boy Stay HERE

Lowering at Gault he added

He aint never been hit nor yet swore at An he dont need to be
Treat him nice like hes used to bein treated An dont get sore on
him if he mopes fer me jes at fust Because hes sure to Dogs aint
like folks They got hearts Folks has only got souls I guess dogs has
the best of it at that

Ferris swung open the door and stumbled out not trusting himself for a
backward glance at the wistfully grieved dog he had left behind

Lurchingly he made off across the lawn and out through the wicket He
was numb and sick He moved mechanically and with no conscious power of
thought or of locomotion

Out in the highroad a homing instinct guided his leaden feet in the
direction of Hampton And he plodded dazedly the interminable four
miles that separated him from his desolate farm

As he turned in at his own gate he was aware of a poignant dread that
pierced his numbness And he knew it for a dread of entering the house
and of finding no one to welcome him Setting his teeth he went
forward unlocked the door and stamped into the silent kitchen

Upon the table he dumped the paperswathed cup he had been carrying
unnoticed under his arm Beside it he threw the little purse full of
gold pieces and the wad of prize ribbons Stepping back his foot
struck something He looked down and saw it was a gaycolored rubber
ball he had bought months ago for Chumthe dogs favorite plaything

His face twisting Link snatched up the ball and went out onto the
steps to throw it far out of sight that it might no more remind him of
the pet who had so often coaxed him to toss it for retrieval

Ferris hurled the ball far out into the garden As the missile left his
hand an exultant bark reechoed through the silence of the sunset
Chum who had been trotting demurely up the walk sprang gleefully in
pursuit of the ball and presently came galloping back to the dazedly
incredulous Link with the manycolored sphere of rubber between his
jaws

Chum had had no trouble at all in catching his masters trail and
following it home He would have overtaken the slowslouching Ferris
had he been able to slip out of the clubhouse sooner And now it
pleased him to be welcomed by this evident invitation to a game of ball

Link gave a gulping cry and buried both hands in the collies ruff
staring down at the dancing dog in an agony of rapture Then all at
once his muscles tensed and his newly flushed face went greenwhite
again

II guess we got to play it square Chum he muttered aloud with
something like a groan I was blattin to em up there how youd
made a white man of me An a reglar white man dont keep what aint
his own propty Come along Chummie

His jaw very tense his back painfully stiff Link strode heavily down
the lane and out into the highroad Chum always eager for a walk with
his god frisked about him in delight

He had traversed the bulk of the distance to Craigswold the dog beside
him when he remembered that he had left his horse and buggy at the
livery stable there in the morning Well that would save his aching
feet a fourmile walk home In the meantime

He and Chum stepped to the roadside to avoid a fasttraveling little
motor car which was bearing down on them from the direction of
Craigswold

The car did not pass them Instead it came to a gearracking halt
close beside Ferris Link glancing up in dull lack of interest beheld
Gault and the latters daughter staring down at him

Chum came home said Ferris scowling at them He trailed me Dont
lick him fer it Hes only a dog an he didnt know no better I was
bringin him back to you

The girl looked sharply at her father Gault fidgeted uneasily as he
had done once or twice that afternoon in the clubhouse And he avoided
his daughters gaze So she turned her level eyes on Link

Mr Ferris she said very quietly do you mean to say when this dog
came back to you you were actually going to return him to us instead
of hiding him somewhere till the search was over

Im here aint I countered Ferris defiantly

But why she insisted WHY

Because Im a fool I spose he growled I guess Chum wouldnt care
much bout livin with a thief Take him up there with you on the seat
Dont let him fall out Anhis voice scaling a half octave in its
painkeep him to home after this I aint no measly angel I cant
swear Id have the grit to fetch him back another time

He stopped to note a curious phenomenon There were actually tears in
the girls big grave eyes Link wondered why Then she said

Cavalier isnt my fathers dog He is mine My father gave him to me
when he bought him last spring Colonel Marden seemed to have
forgotten that today And I didnt want to start a squabble by
reminding him of it After all its my fathers affair and mine
Nobody elses My father got me another collie last spring to take
Cavaliers place A collie Im ever so fond of So I dont need
Cavalier I dont want him I tried to find you to tell you so But you
had gone So I got my father to drive me to your place Wed have
started sooner but Cavalier got away And we waited to look for
himto bring him along

Bring him along mutteringly echoed the blankbrained Link What fer

Why laughed the girl because your house is where he belongs and
where he is going to live Just as he has been living all summer

Ferris caught his breath in a choked wheeze of unbelieving ecstasy

Gawd he breathed GAWD

Then he stammered brokenly

Theythey dont seem no right words toto thank you in Maam But
maybe you undstand what Id want to say if I could

Yes she said gently I think I understand I understood from the
minute I saw you and the dog together Thats why I decided I didnt
want him Thats why I

An youll get that thousand dollars cried Link his fingers buried
rapturously in Chums fur Evry cent of it I

I think interrupted the girl winking very fast I think Ive got
what I wanted already My father doesnt want the money either Do
you Dad

Oh for heavens sake stop rubbing it in fumed Gault Come on
home Its getting cold I ought to thank the Lord for not having you
anywhere near me in Wall Street girl Youd send me under the hammer
in a week

He kicked the accelerator and the little car whizzed off in the
twilight

Chum observed Ferris gaping after it Chum I guess the good Lord
built that gal the same day He built YOU If He didwell He sure done
one grand days work



CHAPTER IV

The Choice

Luck had come at last to the Ferris farm Links cash went into
improvements on the place instead of going into the deteriorating of
his inner man And he worked the better A sulky man is ever prone to
be an inefficient man And Link no longer sulked

All thiscombined with a wholesale boom in local agriculture and
especially in truck gardeninghad wrought wonders in Links farm and
in Links bank account Within three years of Ferriss meeting with
Chum the places last mortgage was wiped out and a score of needed
repairs and improvements were installed Also the man had a small but
steadily growing sum to his credit in a Paterson savings bank

Life on the farm was mighty pleasant nowadays Work was hard of
course but it was bringing results that made it more than worth while
Ferris and his dog were living on the fat of the land And they were
happy

Then came the interruption that had been inevitable from the very first

A taciturn and eternally deadbroke man in a rural region need not
fear intrusion on his privacy Convivial folk make detours round him
as if he were a mud puddle Thriftier and more respectable neighbors
eye him askance or eye him not at all

But when a meed of permanent success comes to such a man he need no
longer be lonely unless he so wills Which is not cynicism but common
sense The convivial element will still fight shy of him But he is
welcomed into the circle of the respectable

So it was with Link Ferris Of old he had been known as a shiftless and
harddrinking mountaineer with a sour farm that was plastered with
mortgages Now he had cleared off his mortgages and had cleaned up his
farm and he and his home exuded an increasing prosperity

People meeting him in the nearby village of Hampton or at church
began to treat him with a consideration that the longaloof farmer
found bewildering

Yet he liked it rather than not being at heart a gregarious soul And
with gruff friendliness he met the advances of welltodo neighbors who
in old days had scarce favored him with a nod

The gradual change from the isolated life of former years did not make
any sort of a hit with Chum The collie had been well content to wander
through the days work at his masters heels to bring in the sheep and
the cattle from pasture to guard the farm from intrudershuman or
otherwise

In the evenings it had been sweet to lounge at Links feet on the
little white porch in the summer dusk or to lie in drowsy content in
front of the glowing kitchen stove on icy nights when the gale
screeched through the naked boughs of the dooryard trees and the snow
scratched hungrily at the window panes

Now the dogs sensitive brain was aware of a subtle alteration He did
not object very much to the occasional visits at the house of other
farmers and townsfolk during the erstwhile quiet evenings although he
had been happier in the years of peaceful seclusion

But he grieved at his masters increasingly frequent absences from
home Nowadays once or twice a week Link was wont to dress himself in
his best as soon as the days work was done and fare forth to Hampton
for the evening

Sometimes he let Chum go with him in these outings Oftener of late he
had said as he started out

Not tonight Chummie Stay here

Obediently the big dog would lay himself down with a sigh on the porch
edge his head between his white little forepaws his sorrowful brown
eyes following the progress of his master down the lane to the highroad

But he grieved as only a sensitive highbred dog can grievea dog who
asks nothing better of life than permission to live and to die at the
side of the man he has chosen as his god to follow that god out into
rain or chill to starve with him if need be to suffer at his
handsin short to do or to be anything except to be separated from
him

Link Ferris had gotten into the habit of leaving Chum alone at home
oftener and oftener of late as his own evening absences from the farm
grew more and more frequent

He left Chum at home because She did not like dogs

She was Dorcas Chatham the daughter of Hamptons postmaster and
general storekeeper

Old Man Chatham in former days would have welcomed Cal Whitson the
official village souse to his home as readily as he would have
admitted the neerdowell Link Ferris to that sanctuary But of late
he had noted the growing improvement in Links fortunes as evidenced
by his larger store trade his invariable cash payments and the
frequent money orders which went in his name to the Paterson savings
bank

Wherefore when Dorcas met Link at a church sociable and again on a
straw ride and asked him to come and see her some time her sire made
no objection Indeed he welcomed the bashful caller with something like
an approach to cordiality

Dorcas was a calmeyed efficient damsel more than a little pretty
and with much repose of manner Link Ferris from the first eyed her
with a certain awe When a mystic growing attraction was added to this
and when it in turn merged into love the sense of awe was not lost
Rather it was strengthened

In all his thirtyone lean and lonely years Link had never before
fallen in love At the age when most youths are sighing over some
wonder girl he had been too busy fighting off bankruptcy and
starvation to have time or thought for such things

Wherefore when love at last smote him it smote him hard And it found
him woefully unprepared for the battle

He knew nothing of women He did not know for example what the
average youth finds out in his teensthat grave eyes and silent
aloofness and lofty selfwill and icy pietism in a maiden do not always
signify that she is a saint and that she must be worshiped as such
Ferris had no one to tell him that far oftener these signs point merely
to stupid narrowness and to lack of ideas

Dorcas was clever at housework She was quietly selfassured She was
good to look upon She was not like any of the few girls Link had met
Wherefore he built for her a sacred shrine in his innermost heart and
he knelt before her image there

If Ferris found her different from the other Hampton girls Dorcas
found him equally different from the local swains she knew She
recognized his hidden strength The maternal element in her nature
sympathized with his loneliness and with the marks it had left upon his
soul

For the resthe was neither a village cutup like Con Skerly nor a
solemn mass of conceit like Royal Crews nor patronizing like young
Lawyer Wetherell nor vaguely repulsive like old Capn Baldy Todd who
came furtively acourting her Link was different And she liked him
She liked him more and more

Once her parents took Dorcas and her fiveyearold sister Olive on a
Sunday afternoon ramble which led eventually to the Ferris farm Link
welcomed the chance callers gladly and showed them over the place
Dorcass housewifely eye rejoiced in the wellkept house even while
she frowned inwardly at its thousand signs of bachelor inefficiency
The stock and the crops too spoke of solid industry

But she shrank back in sudden revolt as a huge tawny collie came
bounding toward her from the fold where he had just marshaled the sheep
for the night The dog was beautiful And he meant her no harm He even
tried shyly to make friends with the tall and graveeyed guest Dorcas
saw all that Yet she shrank from him with instinctive fearin spite
of it

As a child she had been bittenand bitten badlyby a nondescript
mongrel that had been chased into the Chatham backyard by a crowd of
stonethrowing boys and which she had sought to oust with a stick from
its hiding place under the steps Since then Dorcas had had an
unconquerable fear and dislike of dogs The feeling was unconquerable
because she had made no effort to conquer it She had henceforth judged
all dogs by the one whose teeth marks had left a lifelong scar on her
white forearm

She had the good breeding not to let Ferris see her distaste for his
pet that he was just then exhibiting so proudly to the guests Her
shrinking was imperceptible even to a lovers solicitous eye But Chum
noted it And with a collies odd sixth sense he knew this intruder did
not like him

Not that her aversion troubled Chum at all but it puzzled him People
as a rule were effusively eager to make friends with Chum Andbeing
ultraconservative like the best type of colliehe found their
handling and other attentions annoying He had taken a liking to
Dorcas at sight But since she did not return this liking Chum was
well content to keep away from her

He was the more content because fiveyearold Olive had flung herself
with loud squeals of rapture bodily on the dog and had clasped her
fat little arms adoringly round his massive furry throat in an ecstasy
of delight

Chum had never before been brought into such close contact with a
child And Link watched with some slight perturbation the babys
onslaught But in a moment Ferriss mind was at rest

At first touch of the babys fingers the collie had become once and for
all Olives slave He fairly reveled in the discomfortingly tight
caress The tug of the little hands in his sensitive neck fur was bliss
to him Wiggling all over with happiness he sought to lick the chubby
face pressed so tight against his ruff From that instant Chum had a
divided allegiance His human god was Ferris But this fluffy
pinkandwhite youngster was a mighty close second in his list of
deities

Dorcas looked on trembling with fear as her little sister romped with
the adoring dog And she heaved a sigh of relief when at last they were
clear of the farm without mishap to the baby For Olive had been dearer
to Dorcas from birth than anyone or anything else on earth To the
baby sister alone Dorcas ceased to be the graveeyed and selfassured
Lady of Quality and became a meek and worshiping devotee

When Link Ferris at last mustered courage to ask Dorcas Chatham to
marry him his form of proposal would have been ruled out of any novel
or play It consisted chiefly of a mouthful of halfswallowed
halfexploded words spoken all in one panic breath to the
accompaniment of a mortal fear that shook him to the marrow

Any other words thus mouthed and gargled would have required a full
college of languages to translate them But the speech was along a line
perfectly familiar to every woman since Eve And Dorcas understood She
would have understood had Link voiced his proposal in the Choctaw
dialect instead of a slurringly mumbled travesty on English

The mans stark earnestness of entreaty sent a queer flutter to the
very depths of her calm soul But the flutter failed to reach or to
titillate the steady eyes Nor did it creep into the level and
selfpossessed voice as Dorcas made quiet answer

Yes I like you better than any other man I know And Ill marry you
if youre perfectly sure you care for me that way

No it was not the sort of reply Juliet made to the same question It
is more than doubtful that Cleopatra answered thus when Antony offered
to throw away the world for her sake But it was a wholly correct and
selfrespecting response And Dorcas had been rehearsing it for nearly
a week

Moreover words are of use merely as they affect their hearers And
all the passion poetry of men and of angels could not have thrilled
Link Ferris as did Dorcass correct and demure assent to his frenziedly
gabbled plea It went through the lovesick mans brain and heart like
the breath of God

And thus the couple became engaged

With only a slight diminishing of his earlier fear did Link seek out
Old Man Chatham to obtain his consent to the match Dizzy with joy and
relief he listened to that village worthys ungracious assent also
secretly rehearsed for some days

For the best part of a month thereafter Link Ferris floated through a
universe of roseate lights and soft music

Then came the jar of awakening

It was one Saturday evening a week or so before the date set for the
wedding Dorcas broached a theme which had been much in her mind since
the beginning of the engagement She approached it very tactfully
indeed leading up to it in true feminine fashion by means of a
cunningly devised series of levels which would have been the despair of
a mining engineer Having paved the way she remarked carelessly

John Iglehart was at the store today father says Hes crazy about
that big collie of yours

Instantly Link was full of glad interest It had been a sorrow to him
that Dorcas did not like dogs She had explained her dislikepurely on
general principlesearly in their acquaintance and had told him of
its origin Link was certain she would come to love Chum on intimate
acquaintance In the interim he did not seek to force her liking by
bringing the collie to the Chatham house when he called

Link did not believe in crossing a bridge until he came to it There
would be plenty of time for Dorcas to make friends with Chum in the
long and happy days to come Yet now he rejoiced that she herself
should have been the first to broach the subject

Father says John is wild about Chum went on the girl unconcernedly
adding By the way John asked father to tell you hed be glad to pay
you 100 for the dog Its a splendid offer isnt it Think of all the
things we can get for the house with 100 Link Why it seems almost
providential doesnt it Father says John is in earnest about it too
He

In earnest hey snapped Ferris finding his voice after an instant
of utter amazement In EARNEST Well thats real grand of him aint
it Id be in earnest too if I was to bid ten cents for the best farm
in Passaic County But the feller who owned the farm wouldnt be in
earnest Hed be taking it as a fine joke Like I do when Johnny
Iglehart has the nerve to offer 100 for a dog that wouldnt be worth a
cent lessn 600even if he was for sale Why that collie of mine

If he is worth 600 suggested Dorcas icily youd better not lose
any time before you find someone who will pay that for him Hes no use
to us And 600 is too much money to carry on four legs He

No use to us echoed Link Why Chums worth the pay of a hired man
to me besides all the fondness Ive got for him He handles the sheep
and he

So youve told me interposed Dorcas with no show of interest I
remember the first few times you came to see me you didnt talk of
anything else hardly except that dog Everybody says the same thing
Its a joke all through Hampton the silly way youre forever singing
his praises

Why shouldnt I demanded Link sturdily Theres not a dandier
better pal anywhere than what Chums been to me He

Yes yes assented Dorcas I know I dont doubt it But after all
hes only a dog you know And if you can get a good price for him as
you say then the only thing to do is to sell him In hard times like
these

Times aint hard denied Link tersely And Chum aint for sale
Thats all there is to it

If one of her fathers sleek cart horses had suddenly walked out of its
stall with a shouted demand that it be allowed to do the driving
henceforth and that its owners do the hauling Dorcas Chatham could
not have been much more surprised than at this unlookedfor speech from
her humble suitor

Up to now Link Ferris had treated the girl as though he were unworthy
to breathe the same air as herself He had been pathetically eager to
concede any and every mooted point to her with a servile abasement
which had roused her contempt even while it had gratified her sense of
power

She had approached with tact the subject of Chums disposal But she
had done so with a view to the saving of Links feelings not with the
faintest idea that her lovebemused slave could venture to oppose her
She knew his fondness for the dog and she had not wished to bring
matters to an issue if tact would serve as well

To punish her serf and to crush rebellion once and for all as well as
to be avenged for her wasted diplomacy Dorcas cast aside her kindlier
intent and drove straight to the point Her calm temper was ruffled
and she spoke with a new heat

There is something you and I may as well settle here and now Link
she said It will save bickerings and misunderstandings later on
Ive told you how I hate dogs They are savage and treacherous and

Chum aint declared Link stoutly

Why that dog

I hate dogs she went on and Im horribly afraid of them I wont
live in the same house with one I dont want to hurt your feelings
Link but youll have to get rid of that great brown brute before you
marry me That is positive So please lets say no more about it

The man was staring at her with under jaw ajar Her sharp air of
finality grated on his every nerve Her ultimatum concerning Chum left
him dumfounded But he forced himself to rally to the defense

This glorious sweetheart of his did not understand dogs He had hoped
to teach her later to like and appreciate them But apparently she must
be taught at once that Chum could not be sold and that the collie must
remain an honored member of the Ferris household Marshaling his facts
and his words he said

I never told you about the time I was coming back home one night from
the tavern here at Hampton after Id just cashed my pay check from the
Patson market Ive never blabbed much about it because I was drunk
Yes it was back in them days Just after Id got Chum A couple of
fellers had got me drunk And they set on me in a lonesome patch of the
road by the lake and they had me down and was taking the money away
from me when Chum sailed into them and druv them off He had follered
me without me knowing In the scrimmage I got tumbled headfirst into
the lake I was too drunk to get out and my head was stuck in the mud
way under water Id a drowned if Chum hadnt of pulled me out with
his teeth in the shoulder of my coat And thats the dog youre wanting
me to sell

You arent likely to need such help again I hope countered the girl
loftily now that you have stopped drinking and made a man of
yourself So Chum wont be needed for

I stopped drinking answered Link because I got to seeing how much
more of a beast I was than the fine clean dog that was living with me
He made me feel shamed of myself And he was such good compny round
the house that I didnt get lonesome enough to sneak down to the tavern
all the time It wasnt me that made a man of myself It was Chum
made a man of me Maybe that sounds foolish to you But

It does said Dorcas serenely Very foolish indeed You dont seem
to realize that a dog is only an animal If you can get a nice home for
the colliesuch as John Iglehart will give him

Iglehart raged Link momentarily losing hold over himself If that
mangy walleyed slob comes slinking round my farm again making
friends with Chum Ill sick the dog onto him and have him run
Iglehart all the way to his own shack Hes There I didnt mean to
cut loose like that he broke off at Dorcass shudder of dismay Only
it riles me something terrible to have him trying to get Chum away from
me

There is no occasion to go losing your temper and shouting reproved
the girl Nothing is to be gained that way Besides that isnt the
point The point is this since you force me to say it You must get
rid of that dog And you must do it before you marry me I wont set
foot in your house until your dog is goneand gone for good I am
sorry to speak so but it had to be said

She paused to give her slave a chance to wilt But Link only sat
blankfaced staring at her His mind was in a muddle All his narrow
world was upside down He couldnt make his brain grasp in full the
situation

All he could visualize for the instant was a shadowy mental image of
Chums expectant face the tulip ears pricked forward expectant the
jaws laughing the deepset brown eyes abrim with gay affection and
deathless loyalty for the man who was now asked to get rid of him It
didnt make sense Half under his breath Link Ferris began to talkor
rather to ramble

There was one of the books over to the libry he heard himself
meandering on with a queer story in it I got to reading it through
one night last winter It was about a feller named Fedrigo A wop of
some kind I guess He got so hard up he didnt have anything left but
a pet falcon Whatever a falcon may be Whatever it was it musta
been good to eat But he set a heap of store by it Him and it was
chums Same as me and Chum are Then along come a lady he was in love
with And she stopped to his house for dinner There wasnt anything in
the house fit for her to eat So he fed her the falcon Killed the pet
that was his chum sos he could feed the dame he was stuck on I
thought when I read it that that feller was more kinds of a swine
than Id have time to tell you But he wasnt any worsen Id be if I
was to

Im sorry you care so little for me intervened Dorcas her voice
very sweet and very cold and her slender nose whitening a little at
the corners of the nostrils Of course if you prefer a miserable dog
to me theres nothing more to be said I

No almost yelled the miserable man Youve got me all wrong
dearie Honest you have Cant you understand Your little finger
means a heap more to me than evrything else there isexcept the rest
of you

And your dog she supplemented

No he denied fiercely You got no right to say that But Chums
served me faithful And I cant kick him out like he was a

Now you are getting angry again she accused pale and furious I
dont care to be howled at The case stands like this You must choose
whether to get rid of that dog or to lose me Take your choice If

I read in a story book about a feller that had a thing like that put
up to him said poor Link unable to believe she was in earnest His
girl said You gotta choose between me and tobacco And he said
Ill choose tobacco Not that I value tobacco so allfired much he
says but because a girl whod make a man take such a choice aint
worth giving up tobacco for You see dearie its this way

Youll have that dog out of your house and out of your possession
inside of twentyfour hours she decreed the white anger of a
graveeyed woman making her cold voice vibrate or you will drop my
acquaintance That is final And its definite The engagement is
overuntil I hear that your dog is killed or given away or sold Good
night

She left the room in vindictive haste So overwhelmingly angry was she
that she closed the door softly behind her instead of slamming it
Through all his swirl of misery Link had sense enough to note this
final symptom and wonder bitterly at it

On his way out of the house he was hailed by a highpitched baby voice
from somewhere above him Olive had crawled out of bed and in her
white flannel pajamas she was leaning over the upper balustrade

Link she called down to the wretched man at the front door When
you and Dorcas gets married together Im comin to live wiv you Then
I can play wiv Chummie all I want to

Link bolted out to the street in the midst of her announcement And so
occupied was he in trying to swallow a lump in his own throat he
failed to hear the sound of stifled sobbing from behind a locked door
somewhere in the upper reaches of the house

As the night wore on the sleepless girl sought to comfort herself in
the thought that Link had not definitely refused her terms A nights
reflection and an attitude of unbending aloofness on her own part might
well bring him to a surrender

Perhaps it was something in Link Ferriss dejected gait as he turned
into his own lane that night perhaps it was the instinct which tells a
collie when a loved human is unhappybut Chum was at once aware of his
masters woe The dog at first sound of Links approaching steps
bounded from his vigil place on the porch and frisked joyously through
the darkness to meet him He sent forth a trumpeting bark of welcome as
he ran

Thenfifty feet from the oncoming manthe big collie halted and stood
for an instant with ears cocked and eyes troubled After which he
resumed his advance but at a solemn trot and with downcast mien As he
reached Link the collie whined softly under his breath gazing
wistfully up into Ferriss face and then thrusting his cold nose
lovingly into one of the mans loosehanging hands

Link had winced visibly at sound of the jubilantly welcoming bark Now
noting the sudden change in the collies demeanor he stooped and
caught the silken head between his hands The gesture was rough almost
painful Yet Chum knew it was a caress And his drooping plume of a
tail began to wag in response

Oh CHUM exclaimed the man with something akin to a groan You know
all about it dont you old friend You know Im the miserblest man
in North Jersey You know it without me having to say a word And
youre doing your level best to comfort me Just like you always do
You never get cranky and you never say I gotta choose betwixt this and
that and you never get sore at me Youre just my chum And youre
fool enough to think Im all right Yet she says I gotta get rid of
you

The dog pressed closer to him still whining softly and licking the
roughly caressing hands

Whatm I going to do Chummie demanded Link brokenly Whatm I
going to do about it I spose any other fellerd call me a foollike
she thinks I am and tell me to sell you If you was some dogs thatd
be all right But not with YOU Chum Not with you Youd mope and
grieve for me and youd be wondring why Id deserted you after all
these years And youd get to pining and maybe go sick And the feller
that bought you wouldnt understand And most likely hed whale you for
not being more chipperlike And you havent ever been hit IdId a
blame sight sooner shoot you than to let anyone else have you to
abuse you and let you be unhappy for me Chum A blame sight rather

Side by side they moved on into the darkened house There with the dog
curled at his feet Link Ferris lay broad awake until sunrise

Early the next afternoon Dorcas decided she stood in need of brisk
outdoor exercise Olive came running down the path after her eagerly
demanding to be taken along Dorcas with much sternness bade her go
back She wanted to be alone unlessBut she refused to admit to
herself that there was any unless

Olive grievously disappointed stood on the steps watching her big
sister set off up the road She saw Dorcas take the righthand turn at
the fork The babys face cleared Now she knew in which direction
Dorcas was going That fork led to the Glen And the Glen was a
favorite Sunday afternoon ramble for Link and Chum Olive knew that
because she and Dorcas more than once had walked thither to meet them

Olive was pleasantly forgetful of her parents positive command that
she refrain from walking alone on the motorinfested Sunday roads She
set off at a fast jog trot over the nearby hill on whose other side
ran the Glen road

Link Ferris with Chum at his heels was tramping moodily toward the
Glen As he turned into the road he paused in his sullen walk There
strolling unconcernedly some yards in front of him was a tall girl in
white Her back was toward him Yet he would have recognized her at a
hundred times the distance Chum knew her too for he wagged his tail
and started at a faster trot to overtake her

Back called Link

Purposely he spoke as low as possible But the dog heard and obeyed
The girl too started a little and made as if to turn Just then
ensued a wild crackling in the thick roadside bushes which lined the
hillside from highway to crest And a whiteclad little bunch of
humanity came galloping jubilantly out into the road midway between
Dorcas and Link

At the road edge Olives stubby toe caught in a noose of blackberry
vine As the youngster was running full tilt her own impetus sent her
rolling over and over into the center of the dusty turnpike

Before she could get to her feet or even stop rolling a touring car
came round the bend ten yards awaya car that was traveling at a
speed of something like fortyfive miles an hour and whose four
occupants were singing at the top of their lungs

Link Ferris had scarce time to tense his muscles for a futile
springDorcass scream of helpless terror was still unbornwhen the
car was upon the prostrate child

And in the same fraction of a second a furry catapult launched itself
across the wide road at a speed that made it look like tawny blur

Chums mad leap carried him to the baby just as the cars fender hung
above her A slashing grip of his teeth in the shoulder of her white
dress and a lightning heave of his mighty neck and shouldersand the
little form was hurtling through the air and into the weedfilled
wayside ditch

In practically the same instant Chums body whizzed into the air again
But this time by no impetus of its own The highpowered cars fender
had struck it fair and had tossed it into the ditch as though the dog
had been a heap of rags

Therehuddled and lifelesssprawled the beautiful collie The car put
on an extra spurt of speed and disappeared round the next turn

Olive was on her feet before Dorcass flying steps could reach her
Unhurt but vastly indignant the baby opened her mouth to make way for
a series of howls Then her eye falling on the inert dog she ran over
to Chum and began to cry out to him to come to life again

No use of that kid interposed Link kneeling beside the collie he
loved and smoothing the soiled and rumpled fur Its easier to drop
out of life than what it is to come back to it again Well he went on
harshly turning to the weeping Dorcas the question has answered
itself you see No need now to tell me to get rid of him Hes saved
me the bother Like he was always saving me bother That being Chums
way

Something in his throat impeded his fierce speech And he bent over
the dog again his rough hands smoothing the pitifully still body with
loving tenderness Dorcas weeping hysterically fell on her knees
beside Chum and put her arms about the huddled shape She seemed to be
trying to say something her lips close to one of the furry little ears

No use broke in Ferris his voice as grating as a files He cant
hear you now No good to tell him you hate dogs or that youre glad
youve saw the last of him Even if he was alive he wouldnt
understand that Hed never been spoke to that way

Dont Oh dont sobbed the girl Oh Im so

If youre crying for Chum went on the grating voice theres no
need to He was only just a dog He didnt know any better but to get
his life smashed outn him so somebody else could go on living All he
asked was to be with me and work for me and love me After you said he
couldnt keep on doing that there aint any good in your crying for
him It must be niceif youll only stop crying long enough to think
of itto know hes out of your way And IM out of it too he went on
in a gust of fury Spose you two just toddle on now and leave me to
take him home I got the right to that anyhow

He stooped to pick up the dog and he winked with much rapidity to hold
back an annoying mist which came between him and Chum His mouth
corners too were twitching in a way that shamed him He had a babyish
yearning to bury his face in his dead friends fur and cry

DONT Dorcas was wailing Oh you cant punish me any worse than
Im

Her sobbroken voice scaled high and swelled out into a cry of stark
astonishment Slowly Chum was lifting his splendid head and blinking
stupidly about him

The fender had smitten the collie just below the shoulder in a mass of
furarmored muscles In falling into the wayside ditch his skull had
come into sharp contact with a rock Knocked senseless by the
concussion he had lain as dead for the best part of five minutes
After which he had come slowly to his sensesbewildered bruised and
sore but otherwise no worse for the accident

He came to himself to find a weeping woman clutching him stranglingly
round the neck while she tried to kiss his dustsmeared head

Chum did not care at all for this treatment especially from a
comparative stranger But he saw his adored master looking so
idiotically happyover that or something elsethat the dog forbore to
protest

If you really wanted him put out of the way so bad began Link when
he could trust himself to speak

He got no further Dorcas Chatham turned on him in genuine savageness
The big eyes were no longer grave and patronizing The air of aloofness
had fallen from the girl like a discarded garment

Link she blazed Link Ferris If you ever dare speak about getting
rid ofof MY dogIllIll never speak to you again as long asas
long as were married
