A PROTEGEE OF JACK HAMLINS


I

The steamer Silveropolis was sharply and steadily cleaving the broad
placid shallows of the Sacramento River A large wave like an eagre
diverging from its bow was extending to either bank swamping the tules
and threatening to submerge the lower levees The great boat itselfa
vast but delicate structure of airy stories hanging galleries fragile
colonnades gilded cornices and resplendent frescoeswas throbbing
throughout its whole perilous length with the pulse of high pressure and
the strong monotonous beat of a powerful piston Floods of foam pouring
from the high paddleboxes on either side and reuniting in the wake of
the boat left behind a track of dazzling whiteness over which trailed
two dense black banners flung from its lofty smokestacks

Mr Jack Hamlin had quietly emerged from his stateroom on deck and was
looking over the guards His hands were resting lightly on his hips over
the delicate curves of his white waistcoat and he was whistling softly
possibly some air to which he had made certain cardplaying passengers
dance the night before He was in comfortable case and his soft brown
eyes under their long lashes were veiled with gentle tolerance of all
things He glanced lazily along the empty hurricane deck forward he
glanced lazily down to the saloon deck below him Far out against the
guards below him leaned a young girl Mr Hamlin knitted his brows
slightly

He remembered her at once She had come on board that morning with one
Ned Stratton a brother gambler but neither a favorite nor intimate of
Jacks From certain indications in the pair Jack had inferred that she
was some foolish or reckless creature whom Ed had got on a string
and was spiriting away from her friends and family With the abstract
morality of this situation Jack was not in the least concerned For
himself he did not indulge in that sort of game the inexperience and
vacillations of innocence were apt to be bothersome and besides a
certain modest doubt of his own competency to make an original selection
had always made him prefer to confine his gallantries to the wives of
men of greater judgment than himself who had But it suddenly occurred
to him that he had seen Stratton quickly slip off the boat at the last
landing stage Ah that was it he had cast away and deserted her
It was an old story Jack smiled But he was not greatly amused with
Stratton

She was very pale and seemed to be clinging to the network railing
as if to support herself although she was gazing fixedly at the yellow
glancing current below which seemed to be sucked down and swallowed
in the paddlebox as the boat swept on It certainly was a fascinating
sightthis sloping rapid hurrying on to bury itself under the crushing
wheels For a brief moment Jack saw how they would seize anything
floating on that ghastly incline whirl it round in one awful revolution
of the beating paddles and then bury it broken and shattered out of
all recognition deep in the muddy undercurrent of the stream behind
them

She moved away presently with an odd stiff step chafing her gloved
hands together as if they had become stiffened too in her rigid grasp
of the railing Jack leisurely watched her as she moved along the narrow
strip of deck She was not at all to his tastea rather plump girl
with a rustic manner and a great deal of brown hair under her straw
hat She might have looked better had she not been so haggard When she
reached the door of the saloon she paused and then turning suddenly
began to walk quickly back again As she neared the spot where she had
been standing her pace slackened and when she reached the railing she
seemed to relapse against it in her former helpless fashion Jack became
lazily interested Suddenly she lifted her head and cast a quick glance
around and above her In that momentary lifting of her face Jack saw her
expression Whatever it was his own changed instantly the next moment
there was a crash on the lower deck It was Jack who had swung himself
over the rail and dropped ten feet to her side But not before she had
placed one foot in the meshes of the netting and had gripped the railing
for a spring

The noise of Jacks fall might have seemed to her bewildered fancy as a
part of her frantic act for she fell forward vacantly on the railing
But by this time Jack had grasped her arm as if to help himself to his
feet

I might have killed myself by that foolin mightnt I he said
cheerfully

The sound of a voice so near her seemed to recall to her dazed sense the
uncompleted action his fall had arrested She made a convulsive bound
towards the railing but Jack held her fast

Dont he said in a low voice dont it wont pay Its the sickest
game that ever was played by man or woman Come here

He drew her towards an empty stateroom whose door was swinging on its
hinges a few feet from them She was trembling violently he half led
half pushed her into the room closed the door and stood with his back
against it as she dropped into a chair She looked at him vacantly the
agitation she was undergoing inwardly had left her no sense of outward
perception

You know Stratton would be awfully riled continued Jack easily Hes
just stepped out to see a friend and got left by the fool boat Hell be
along by the next steamer and youre bound to meet him in Sacramento

Her staring eyes seemed suddenly to grasp his meaning But to his
surprise she burst out with a certain hysterical desperation No no
Never NEVER again Let me pass I must go and struggled to regain
the door Jack albeit singularly relieved to know that she shared
his private sentiments regarding Stratton nevertheless resisted her
Whereat she suddenly turned white reeled back and sank in a dead faint
in the chair

The gambler turned drew the key from the inside of the door passed
out locking it behind him and walked leisurely into the main saloon
Mrs Johnson he said gravely addressing the stewardess a tall
mulatto with his usual winsome supremacy over dependents and children
youll oblige me if youll corral a few smelling salts vinaigrettes
hairpins and violet powder and unload them in deck stateroom No 257
Theres a lady

A lady Marse Hamlin interrupted the mulatto with an archly
significant flash of her white teeth

A lady continued Jack with unabashed gravity in a sort of
conniption fit A relative of mine in fact a niece my only sisters
child Hadnt seen each other for ten years and it was too much for
her

The woman glanced at him with a mingling of incredulous belief but
delighted obedience hurriedly gathered a few articles from her cabin
and followed him to No 257 The young girl was still unconscious The
stewardess applied a few restoratives with the skill of long experience
and the young girl opened her eyes They turned vacantly from the
stewardess to Jack with a look of half recognition and half frightened
inquiry Yes said Jack addressing the eyes although ostentatiously
speaking to Mrs Johnson shed only just come by steamer to Frisco
and wasnt expecting to see me and we dropped right into each other
here on the boat And I havent seen her since she was so high Sister
Mary ought to have warned me by letter but she was always a slouch at
letter writing There thatll do Mrs Johnson Shes coming round I
reckon I can manage the rest But you go now and tell the purser I want
one of those inside staterooms for my nieceMY NIECE you hearso
that you can be near her and look after her

As the stewardess turned obediently away the young girl attempted to
rise but Jack checked her No he said almost brusquely you and
I have some talking to do before she gets back and weve no time for
foolin You heard what I told her just now Well its got to be as I
said you sabe As long as youre on this boat youre my niece and my
sister Marys child As I havent got any sister Mary you dont run any
risk of falling foul of her and you aint taking any ones place That
settles that Now do you or do you not want to see that man again Say
yes and if hes anywhere above ground Ill yank him over to you as soon
as we touch shore He had no idea of interfering with his colleagues
amours but he had determined to make Stratton pay for the bother their
slovenly sequence had caused him Yet he was relieved and astonished
by her frantic gesture of indignation and abhorrence No he repeated
grimly Well that settles that Now look here quick before she
comesdo you want to go back home to your friends

But here occurred what he had dreaded most and probably thought he had
escaped She had stared at him at the stewardess at the walls with
abstracted vacant and bewildered but always undimmed and unmoistened
eyes A sudden convulsion shook her whole frame her blank expression
broke like a shattered mirror she threw her hands over her eyes and
fell forward with her face to the back of her chair in an outburst of
tears

Alas for Jack with the breaking up of those sealed fountains came her
speech also at first disconnected and incoherent and then despairing
and passionate No she had no longer friends or home She had lost and
disgraced them She had disgraced HERSELF There was no home for her
but the grave Why had Jack snatched her from it Then bit by bit
she yielded up her storya story decidedly commonplace to Jack
uninteresting and even irritating to his fastidiousness She was a
schoolgirl not even a convent girl but the inmate of a Presbyterian
female academy at Napa Jack shuddered as he remembered to have once
seen certain of the pupils walking with a teacher and she lived with
her married sister She had seen Stratton while going to and fro on
the San Francisco boat she had exchanged notes with him had met him
secretly and finally consented to elope with him to Sacramento only
to discover when the boat had left the wharf the real nature of his
intentions Jack listened with infinite weariness and inward chafing He
had read all this before in cheap novelettes in the police reports in
the Sunday papers he had heard a street preacher declaim against
it and warn young women of the serpentlike wiles of tempters of the
Stratton variety But even now Jack failed to recognize Stratton as a
serpent or indeed anything but a blundering cheat and clown who had
left his dirty prentice work on his Jacks hands But the girl was
helpless and it seemed homeless all through a certain desperation
of feeling which in spite of her tears he could not but respect That
momentary shadow of death had exalted her He stroked his mustache
pulled down his white waistcoat and her cry without saying anything
He did not know that this most objectionable phase of her misery was her
salvation and his own

But the stewardess would return in a moment Youd better tell me what
to call you he said quietly I ought to know my nieces first name

The girl caught her breath and between two sobs said Sophonisba

Jack winced It seemed only to need this last sentimental touch to
complete the idiotic situation Ill call you Sophy he said hurriedly
and with an effort

And now look here You are going in that cabin with Mrs Johnson where
she can look after you but I cant So Ill have to take your word for
Im not going to give you away before Mrs Johnson that you wont try
that foolishnessyou know what I meanbefore I see you again Can I
trust you

With her head still bowed over the chair back she murmured slowly
somewhere from under her disheveled hair

Yes

Honest Injin adjured Jack gravely

Yes

The shuffling step of the stewardess was heard slowly approaching
Yes continued Jack abruptly lightly lifting his voice as Mrs
Johnson opened the dooryes if youd only had some of those
spearmint drops of your aunt Rachels that she always gave you when
these fits came on youd have been all right inside of five minutes
Aunty was no slouch of a doctor was she Dear me it only seems
yesterday since I saw her You were just playing round her knee like
a kitten on the back porch How time does fly But heres Mrs Johnson
coming to take you in Now rouse up Sophy and just hook yourself on to
Mrs Johnson on that side and well toddle along

The young girl put back her heavy hair and with her face still averted
submitted to be helped to her feet by the kindly stewardess Perhaps
something homely sympathetic and nurselike in the touch of the mulatto
gave her assurance and confidence for her head lapsed quite naturally
against the womans shoulder and her face was partly hidden as she
moved slowly along the deck Jack accompanied them to the saloon and the
inner stateroom door A few passengers gathered curiously near as much
attracted by the unusual presence of Jack Hamlin in such a procession
as by the girl herself Youll look after her specially Mrs Johnson
said Jack in unusually deliberate terms Shes been a good deal petted
at home and my sister perhaps has rather spoilt her Shes pretty much
of a child still and youll have to humor her Sophy he continued
with ostentatious playfulness directing his voice into the dim recesses
of the stateroom youll just think Mrs Johnsons your old nurse
wont you Think its old Katy hey

To his great consternation the girl approached tremblingly from the
inner shadow The faintest and saddest of smiles for a moment played
around the corners of her drawn mouth and teardimmed eyes as she held
out her hand and said

God bless you for being so kind

Jack shuddered and glanced quickly round But luckily no one heard this
crushing sentimentalism and the next moment the door closed upon her
and Mrs Johnson

It was past midnight and the moon was riding high over the narrowing
yellow river when Jack again stepped out on deck He had just left the
captains cabin and a small social game with the officers which
had served to some extent to vaguely relieve his irritation and
their pockets He had presumably quite forgotten the incident of the
afternoon as he looked about him and complacently took in the quiet
beauty of the night

The low banks on either side offered no break to the uninterrupted level
of the landscape through which the river seemed to wind only as a race
track for the rushing boat Every fibre of her vast but fragile bulk
quivered under the goad of her powerful engines There was no other
movement but hers no other sound but this monstrous beat and panting
the whole tranquil landscape seemed to breathe and pulsate with her
dwellers in the tules miles away heard and felt her as she passed and
it seemed to Jack leaning over the railing as if the whole river swept
like a sluice through her paddleboxes

Jack had quite unconsciously lounged before that part of the railing
where the young girl had leaned a few hours ago As he looked down upon
the streaming yellow millrace below him he noticedwhat neither he
nor the girl had probably noticed beforethat a space of the top bar of
the railing was hinged and could be lifted by withdrawing a small
bolt thus giving easy access to the guards He was still looking at it
whistling softly when footsteps approached

Jack said a lazy voice hows sister Mary

Its a long time since youve seen her only child Jack aint it
said a second voice and yet it sort o seems to me somehow that Ive
seen her before

Jack recognized the voice of two of his late companions at the
cardtable His whistling ceased so also dropped every trace of color
and expression from his handsome face But he did not turn and remained
quietly gazing at the water

Aunt Rachel too must be getting on in years Jack continued the
first speaker halting behind Jack

And Mrs Johnson does not look so much like Sophys old nurse as
she used to remarked the second following his example Still Jack
remained unmoved

You dont seem to be interested Jack continued the first speaker
What are you looking at

Without turning his head the gambler replied Looking at the boat
shes booming along just chawing up and spitting out the river aint
she Look at that sweep of water going under her paddlewheels he
continued unbolting the rail and lifting it to allow the two men to
peer curiously over the guards as he pointed to the murderous incline
beneath them a man wouldnt stand much show who got dropped into it
How these paddles would just snatch him baldheaded pick him up and
slosh him round and round and then sling him out down there in such a
shape that his own father wouldnt know him

Yes said the first speaker with an ostentatious little laugh but
all that aint telling us how sister Mary is

No said the gambler slipping into the opening with a white and rigid
face in which nothing seemed living but the eyes no but its telling
you how two dd fools who didnt know when to shut their mouths might
get them shut once and forever Its telling you what might happen to
two men who tried to play a man who didnt care to be playeda man
who didnt care much what he did when he did it or how he did it but
would do what hed set out to doeven if in doing it he went to hell
with the men he sent there

He had stepped out on the guards beside the two men closing the rail
behind him He had placed his hands on their shoulders they had both
gripped his arms yet viewed from the deck above they seemed at that
moment an amicable even fraternal group albeit the faces of the three
were dead white in the moonlight

I dont think Im so very much interested in sister Mary said the
first speaker quietly after a pause

And I dont seem to think so much of aunt Rachel as I did said his
companion

I thought you wouldnt said Jack coolly reopening the rail and
stepping back again It all depends upon the way you look at those
things Goodnight

Goodnight

The three men paused shook each others hands silently and separated
Jack sauntering slowly back to his stateroom


II


The educational establishment of Mrs Mix and Madame Bance situated
in the best quarter of Sacramento and patronized by the highest state
officials and members of the clergy was a pretty if not an imposing
edifice Although surrounded by a high white picket fence and entered
through a heavily boarded gate its balconies festooned with jasmine
and roses and its spotlessly draped windows as often graced with fresh
flowerlike faces were still plainly and provokingly visible above the
ostentatious spikes of the pickets Nevertheless Mr Jack Hamlin who
had six months before placed his niece Miss Sophonisba Brown under
its protecting care felt a degree of uneasiness even bordering on
timidity which was new to that usually selfconfident man Remembering
how his first appearance had fluttered this dovecote and awakened a
severe suspicion in the minds of the two principals he had discarded
his usual fashionable attire and elegantly fitting garments for a rough
homespun suit supposed to represent a homely agriculturist but which
had the effect of transforming him into an adorable Strephon infinitely
more dangerous in his rustic shepherdlike simplicity He had also
shaved off his silken mustache for the same prudential reasons but had
only succeeded in uncovering the delicate lines of his handsome
mouth and so absurdly reducing his apparent years that his avuncular
pretensions seemed more preposterous than ever and when he had rung
the bell and was admitted by a severe Irish waitingmaid his momentary
hesitation and half humorous diffidence had such an unexpected effect
upon her that it seemed doubtful if he would be allowed to pass beyond
the vestibule Shure miss she said in a whisper to an under teacher
theres wan at the dhure who calls himself Mister Hamlin but av it
is not a young lady maskeradin in her brothers clothes Oim very much
mistaken and av its a boy one of the pupils brothers shure ye might
put a dhress on him when you take the others out for a walk and hed
pass for the beauty of the whole school

Meantime the unconscious subject of this criticism was pacing somewhat
uneasily up and down the formal reception room into which he had been
finally ushered Its farther end was filled by an enormous parlor organ
a number of music books and a cheerfully variegated globe A large
presentation Bible an equally massive illustrated volume on the Holy
Land a few landscapes in cold bluish milk and water colors and rigid
heads in crayonsthe work of pupilswere presumably ornamental An
imposing mahogany sofa and what seemed to be a disproportionate excess
of chairs somewhat coldly furnished the room Jack had reluctantly
made up his mind that if Sophy was accompanied by any one he would be
obliged to kiss her to keep up his assumed relationship As she entered
the room with Miss Mix Jack advanced and soberly saluted her on the
cheek But so positive and apparent was the gallantry of his presence
and perhaps so suggestive of some pastoral flirtation that Miss Mix to
Jacks surprise winced perceptibly and became stony But he was still
more surprised that the young lady herself shrank half uneasily from his
lips and uttered a slight exclamation It was a new experience to Mr
Hamlin

But this somewhat mollified Miss Mix and she slightly relaxed her
austerity She was glad to be able to give the best accounts of Miss
Brown not only as regarded her studies but as to her conduct and
deportment Really with the present freedom of manners and laxity of
home discipline in California it was gratifying to meet a young lady
who seemed to value the importance of a proper decorum and behavior
especially towards the opposite sex Mr Hamlin although her guardian
was perhaps too young to understand and appreciate this To this
inexperience she must also attribute the indiscretion of his calling
during school hours and without preliminary warning She trusted
however that this informality could be overlooked after consultation
with Madame Bance but in the mean time perhaps for half an hour she
must withdraw Miss Brown and return with her to the class Mr Hamlin
could wait in this public room reserved especially for visitors until
they returned Or if he cared to accompany one of the teachers in a
formal inspection of the school she added doubtfully with a glance
at Jacks distracting attractions she would submit this also to Madame
Bance

Thank you thank you returned Jack hurriedly as a depressing vision
of the fifty or sixty scholars rose before his eyes but Id rather
not I mean you know Id just as lief stay here ALONE I wouldnt have
called anyway dont you see only I had a day offandandI wanted
to talk with my niece on family matters He did not say that he had
received a somewhat distressful letter from her asking him to come a
new instinct made him cautious

Considerably relieved by Jacks unexpected abstention which seemed to
spare her pupils the distraction of his graces Miss Mix smiled more
amicably and retired with her charge In the single glance he had
exchanged with Sophy he saw that although resigned and apparently
selfcontrolled she still appeared thoughtful and melancholy She had
improved in appearance and seemed more refined and less rustic in her
school dress but he was conscious of the same distinct separation of
her personality which was uninteresting to him from the sentiment that
had impelled him to visit her She was possibly still hankering after
that fellow Stratton in spite of her protestations to the contrary
perhaps she wanted to go back to her sister although she had declared
she would die first and had always refused to disclose her real name
or give any clue by which he could have traced her relations She would
cry of course he almost hoped that she would not return alone he half
regretted he had come She still held him only by a single quality
of her naturethe desperation she had shown on the boat that was
something he understood and respected

He walked discontentedly to the window and looked out he walked
discontentedly to the end of the room and stopped before the organ
It was a fine instrument he could see that with an admiring and
experienced eye He was alone in the room in fact quite alone in that
part of the house which was separated from the classrooms He would
disturb no one by trying it And if he did what then He smiled a
little recklessly slowly pulled off his gloves and sat down before it

He played cautiously at first with the soft pedal down The instrument
had never known a strong masculine hand before having been fumbled and
friveled over by softly incompetent feminine fingers But presently it
began to thrill under the passionate hand of its lover and carried away
by his one innocent weakness Jack was launched upon a sea of musical
reminiscences Scraps of church music Puritan psalms of his boyhood
dying strains from sad forgotten operas fragments of oratorios and
symphonies but chiefly phases from old masses heard at the missions
of San Pedro and Santa Isabel swelled up from his loving and masterful
fingers He had finished an Agnus Dei the formal room was pulsating
with divine aspiration the rascals hands were resting listlessly on
the keys his brown lashes lifted in an effort of memory tenderly
towards the ceiling

Suddenly a subdued murmur of applause and a slight rustle behind him
recalled him to himself again He wheeled his chair quickly round The
two principals of the school and half a dozen teachers were standing
gravely behind him and at the open door a dozen curled and frizzled
youthful heads peered in eagerly but half restrained by their teachers
The relaxed features and apologetic attitude of Madame Bance and Miss
Mix showed that Mr Hamlin had unconsciously achieved a triumph

He might not have been as pleased to know that his extraordinary
performance had solved a difficulty effaced his other graces and
enabled them to place him on the moral pedestal of a mere musician to
whom these eccentricities were allowable and privileged He shared the
admiration extended by the young ladies to their music teacher which
was always understood to be a sexless enthusiasm and a contagious
juvenile disorder It was also a fine advertisement for the organ
Madame Bance smiled blandly improved the occasion by thanking Mr
Hamlin for having given the scholars a gratuitous lesson on the
capabilities of the instrument and was glad to be able to give Miss
Brown a halfholiday to spend with her accomplished relative Miss Brown
was even now upstairs putting on her hat and mantle Jack was relieved
Sophy would not attempt to cry on the street

Nevertheless when they reached it and the gate closed behind them he
again became uneasy The girls clouded face and melancholy manner were
not promising It also occurred to him that he might meet some one who
knew him and thus compromise her This was to be avoided at all hazards
He began with forced gayety

Well now where shall we go

She slightly raised her teardimmed eyes Where you pleaseI dont
care

There isnt any show going on here is there He had a vague idea of a
circus or menageriehimself behind her in the shadow of the box

I dont know of any

Or any restaurantor cake shop

Theres a place where the girls go to get candy on Main Street Some of
them are there now

Jack shuddered this was not to be thought of But where do you walk

Up and down Main Street

Where everybody can see you said Jack scandalized

The girl nodded

They walked on in silence for a few moments Then a bright idea struck
Mr Hamlin He suddenly remembered that in one of his many fits
of impulsive generosity and largesse he had given to an old negro
retainerwhose wife had nursed him through a dangerous illnessa house
and lot on the river bank He had been told that they had opened a small
laundry or washhouse It occurred to him that a stroll there and a
call upon Uncle Hannibal and Aunt Chloe combined the propriety and
respectability due to the young person he was with and the requisite
secrecy and absence of publicity due to himself He at once suggested
it

You see she was a mighty good woman and you ought to know her for she
was my old nurse

The girl glanced at him with a sudden impatience

Honest Injin said Jack solemnly she did nurse me through my last
cough I aint playing old family gags on you now

Oh dear burst out the girl impulsively I do wish you wouldnt ever
play them again I wish you wouldnt pretend to be my uncle I wish you
wouldnt make me pass for your niece It isnt right Its all wrong
Oh dont you know its all wrong and cant come right any way Its
just killing me I cant stand it Id rather youd say what I am and
how I came to you and how you pitied me

They had luckily entered a narrow side street and the sobs which shook
the young girls frame were unnoticed For a few moments Jack felt a
horrible conviction stealing over him that in his present attitude
towards her he was not unlike that hound Stratton and that however
innocent his own intent there was a sickening resemblance to the
situation on the boat in the base advantage he had taken of her
friendlessness He had never told her that he was a gambler like
Stratton and that his peculiarly infelix reputation among women made it
impossible for him to assist her except by a stealth or the deception
he had practiced without compromising her He who had for years faced
the sneers and halffrightened opposition of the world dared not tell
the truth to this girl from whom he expected nothing and who did not
interest him He felt he was almost slinking at her side At last he
said desperately

But I snatched them baldheaded at the organ Sophy didnt I

Oh yes said the girl you played beautifully and grandly It was so
good of you too For I think somehow Madame Bance had been a little
suspicious of you but that settled it Everybody thought it was fine
and some thought it was your profession Perhaps she added timidly
it is

I play a good deal I reckon said Jack with a grim humor which did
not however amuse him

I wish I could and make money by it said the girl eagerly Jack
winced but she did not notice it as she went on hurriedly Thats what
I wanted to talk to you about I want to leave the school and make my
own living Anywhere where people wont know me and where I can be alone
and work I shall die here among these girlswith all their talk of
their friends and theirsistersand their questions about you

Tell em to dry up said Jack indignantly Take em to the cake shop
and load em up with candy and ice cream Thatll stop their mouths
Youve got money you got my last remittance didnt you he repeated
quickly If you didnt hereshis hand was already in his pocket
when she stopped him with a despairing gesture

Yes yes I got it all I havent touched it I dont want it For I
cant live on you Dont you understandI want to work ListenI can
draw and paint Madame Bance says I do it well my drawingmaster says
I might in time take portraits and get paid for it And even now I can
retouch photographs and make colored miniatures from them And she
stopped and glanced at Jack halftimidly Ivedone some already

A glow of surprised relief suffused the gambler Not so much at this
astonishing revelation as at the change it seemed to effect in her Her
pale blue eyes made paler by tears cleared and brightened under
their swollen lids like wiped steel the lines of her depressed mouth
straightened and became firm Her voice had lost its hopeless monotone

Theres a shop in the next streeta photographerswhere they
have one of mine in their windows she went on reassured by Jacks
unaffected interest Its only round the corner if you care to see

Jack assented a few paces farther brought them to the corner of a
narrow street where they presently turned into a broader thoroughfare
and stopped before the window of a photographer Sophy pointed to an
oval frame containing a portrait painted on porcelain Mr Hamlin was
startled Inexperienced as he was a certain artistic inclination
told him it was good although it is to be feared he would have been
astonished even if it had been worse The mere fact that this headstrong
country girl who had run away with a cur like Stratton should be able
to do anything else took him by surprise

I got ten dollars for that she said hesitatingly and I could have
got more for a larger one but I had to do that in my room during
recreation hours If I had more time and a place where I could
workshe stopped timidly and looked tentatively at Jack But he was
already indulging in a characteristically reckless idea of coming back
after he had left Sophy buying the miniature at an extravagant price
and ordering half a dozen more at extraordinary figures Here however
two passersby stopping ostensibly to look in the window but really
attracted by the picturesque spectacle of the handsome young rustic and
his schoolgirl companion gave Jack such a fright that he hurried
Sophy away again into the side street Theres nothing mean about that
picture business he said cheerfully it looks like a square kind of
game and relapsed into thoughtful silence

At which Sophy the ice of restraint broken again burst into
passionate appeal If she could only go away somewherewhere she saw no
one but the people who would buy her work who knew nothing of her past
nor cared to know who were her relations She would work hard she knew
she could support herself in time She would keep the name he had given
herit was not distinctive enough to challenge any inquirybut
nothing more She need not assume to be his niece he would always be
her kind friend to whom she owed everything even her miserable life
She trusted still to his honor never to seek to know her real name nor
ever to speak to her of that man if he ever met him It would do no good
to her or to them it might drive her for she was not yet quite sure of
herself to do that which she had promised him never to do again

There was no threat impatience or acting in her voice but he
recognized the same dull desperation he had once heard in it and her
eyes which a moment before were quick and mobile had become fixed and
set He had no idea of trying to penetrate the foolish secret of her
name and relations he had never had the slightest curiosity but it
struck him now that Stratton might at any time force it upon him The
only way that he could prevent it was to let it be known that for
unexpressed reasons he would shoot Stratton on sight This would
naturally restrict any verbal communication between them Jacks ideas
of morality were vague but his convictions on points of honor were
singularly direct and positive


III


Meantime Hamlin and Sophy were passing the outskirts of the town the
open lots and cleared spaces were giving way to grassy stretches willow
copses and groups of cottonwood and sycamore and beyond the level of
yellowing tules appeared the fringed and raised banks of the river
Half tropical looking cottages with deep verandasthe homes of early
Southern pioneerstook the place of incomplete blocks of modern
houses monotonously alike In these sylvan surroundings Mr Hamlins
picturesque rusticity looked less incongruous and more Arcadian the
young girl had lost some of her restraint with her confidences and
lounging together side by side without the least consciousness of any
sentiment in their words or actions they nevertheless contrived to
impress the spectator with the idea that they were a charming pair of
pastoral lovers So strong was this impression that as they approached
Aunt Chloes laundry a pretty rosecovered cottage with an enormous
whitewashed barnlike extension in the rear the black proprietress
herself standing at the door called her husband to come and look at
them and flashed her white teeth in such unqualified commendation
and patronage that Mr Hamlin withdrawing himself from Sophys side
instantly charged down upon them

If you dont slide the lid back over that grinning box of dominoes of
yours and take it inside Ill just carry Hannibal off with me he said
in a quick whisper with a halfwicked halfmischievous glitter in his
brown eyes That young ladysA LADYdo you understand No riffraff
friend of mine but a regular NUNa saintdo you hear So you just
stand back and let her take a good look round and rest herself until
she wants you Two black idiots Miss Brown he continued cheerfully
in a higher voice of explanation as Sophy approached who think
because one of em used to shave me and the other saved my life theyve
got a right to stand at their humble cottage door and frighten horses

So great was Mr Hamlins ascendency over his former servants that even
this ingenious pleasantry was received with every sign of affection
and appreciation of the humorist and of the profound respect for his
companion Aunt Chloe showed them effusively into her parlor a small
but scrupulously neat and sweetsmelling apartment inordinately
furnished with a huge mahogany centretable and chairs and the most
fragile and meretricious china and glass ornaments on the mantel But
the three jasmineedged lattice windows opened upon a homely garden of
oldfashioned herbs and flowers and their fragrance filled the room
The cleanest and starchiest of curtains the most dazzling and whitest
of tidies and chaircovers bespoke the adjacent laundry indeed the
whole cottage seemed to exhale the odors of lavender soap and freshly
ironed linen Yet the cottage was large for the couple and their
assistants Dar was two front rooms on de next flo dat dey never
used explained Aunt Chloe friends allowed dat dey could let em to
white folks but dey had always been done kep for Marse Hamlin ef he
ever wanted to be wid his old niggers again Jack looked up quickly
with a brightened face made a sign to Hannibal and the two left the
room together

When he came through the passage a few moments later there was a sound
of laughter in the parlor He recognized the full round lazy chuckle of
Aunt Chloe but there was a higher girlish ripple that he did not know
He had never heard Sophy laugh before Nor when he entered had he
ever seen her so animated She was helping Chloe set the table to that
ladys intense delight at Missys girlish housewifery She was picking
the berries fresh from the garden buttering the Sally Lunn making the
tea and arranging the details of the repast with apparently no trace
of her former discontent and unhappiness in either face or manner He
dropped quietly into a chair by the window and with the homely scents
of the garden mixing with the honest odors of Aunt Chloes cookery
watched her with an amusement that was as pleasant and grateful as it
was strange and unprecedented

Now den said Aunt Chloe to her husband as she put the finishing
touch to the repast in a plate of doughnuts as exquisitely brown and
shining as Jacks eyes were at that moment Hannibal you just come
away and let dem two white quality chillens have dey tea Deys done
starved shuah And with an approving nod to Jack she bundled her
husband from the room

The door closed the young girl began to pour out the tea but Jack
remained in his seat by the window It was a singular sensation which
he did not care to disturb It was no new thing for Mr Hamlin to find
himself at a teteatete repast with the admiring and complaisant fair
there was a cabinet particulier in a certain San Francisco restaurant
which had listened to their various vanities and professions of undying
faith he might have recalled certain festal rendezvous with a widow
whose piety and impeccable reputation made it a moral duty for her to
come to him only in disguise it was but a few days ago that he had
been let privately into the palatial mansion of a high official for a
midnight supper with a foolish wife It was not strange therefore that
he should be alone here secretly with a member of that indiscreet
loving sex But that he should be sitting there in a cheap negro laundry
with absolutely no sentiment of any kind towards the heavyhaired
frecklefaced country schoolgirl opposite him from whom he sought
and expected nothing and ENJOYING it without scorn of himself or his
companion to use his own expression got him Presently he rose and
sauntered to the table with shining eyes

Well what do you think of Aunt Chloes shebang he asked smilingly

Oh its so sweet and clean and homelike said the girl quickly At
any other time he would have winced at the last adjective It struck him
now as exactly the word

Would you like to live here if you could

Her face brightened She put the teapot down and gazed fixedly at Jack

Because you can Look here I spoke to Hannibal about it You can have
the two front rooms if you want to One of em is big enough and light
enough for a studio to do your work in You tell that nigger what you
want to put in em and hes got my orders to do it I told him about
your painting said you were the daughter of an old friend you know
Hold on Sophy dn it all Ive got to do a little giltedged lying
but I let you out of the niece business this time Yes from this moment
Im no longer your uncle I renounce the relationship Its hard
continued the rascal after all these years and considering sister
Marys feelings but as you seem to wish it it must be done

Sophys steelblue eyes softened She slid her long brown hand across
the table and grasped Jacks He returned the pressure quickly and
fraternally even to that halfshamed halfhurried evasion of emotion
peculiar to all brothers This was also a new sensation but he liked
it

You are tootoo good Mr Hamlin she said quietly

Yes said Jack cheerfully thats whats the matter with me It isnt
natural and if I keep it up too long it brings on my cough

Nevertheless they were happy in a boy and girl fashion eating
heartily and I fear not always decorously scrambling somewhat for
the strawberries and smacking their lips over the Sally Lunn Meantime
it was arranged that Mr Hamlin should inform Miss Mix that Sophy would
leave school at the end of the term only a few days hence and then
transfer herself to lodgings with some old family servants where she
could more easily pursue her studies in her own profession She need not
make her place of abode a secret neither need she court publicity She
would write to Jack regularly informing him of her progress and he
would visit her whenever he could Jack assented gravely to the further
proposition that he was to keep a strict account of all the moneys he
advanced her and that she was to repay him out of the proceeds of her
first pictures He had promised also with a slight mental reservation
not to buy them all himself but to trust to her success with the
public They were never to talk of what had happened before she was to
begin life anew Of such were their confidences spoken often together
at the same moment and with their mouths full Only one thing troubled
Jack he had not yet told her frankly who he was and what was his
reputation he had hitherto carelessly supposed she would learn it
and in truth had cared little if she did but it was evident from her
conversation that day that by some miracle she was still in ignorance
Unable now to tell her himself he had charged Hannibal to break it to
her casually after he was gone You can let me down easy if you like
but youd better make a square deal of it while youre about it And
Jack had added cheerfully if she thinks after that shed better drop
me entirely you just say that if she wishes to STAY youll see that
I dont ever come here again And you keep your word about it too you
black nigger or Ill be the first to thrash you

Nevertheless when Hannibal and Aunt Chloe returned to clear away the
repast they were a harmonious party albeit Mr Hamlin seemed more
content to watch them silently from his chair by the window a cigar
between his lips and the pleasant distraction of the homely scents and
sounds of the garden in his senses Allusion having been made again to
the morning performance of the organ he was implored by Hannibal to
diversify his talent by exercising it on an old guitar which had passed
into that retainers possession with certain clothes of his masters
when they separated Mr Hamlin accepted it dubiously it had twanged
under his volatile fingers in more pretentious but less innocent halls
But presently he raised his tenor voice and soft brown lashes to the
humble ceiling and sang

 Way down upon the Swanee River

Discoursed Jack plaintively

 Far far away
 Thars whar my heart is turning ever
 Thars whar the old folks stay

The two dusky scions of an emotional race that had been wont to sweeten
its toil and condone its wrongs with music sat wrapt and silent
swaying with Jacks voice until they could burst in upon the chorus
The jasmine vines trilled softly with the afternoon breeze a slender
yellowhammer perhaps emulous of Jack swung himself from an outer
spray and peered curiously into the room and a few neighbors gathering
at their doors and windows remarked that after all when it came to
real singing no one could beat those dd niggers

The sun was slowly sinking in the rolling gold of the river when Jack
and Sophy started leisurely back through the broken shafts of light and
across the farstretching shadows of the cottonwoods In the midst of
a lazy silence they were presently conscious of a distant monotonous
throb the booming of the up boat on the river The sound came
nearerpassed them the boat itself hidden by the trees but a trailing
cloud of smoke above cast a momentary shadow upon their path The girl
looked up at Jack with a troubled face Mr Hamlin smiled reassuringly
but in that instant he had made up his mind that it was his moral duty
to kill Mr Edward Stratton


IV


For the next two months Mr Hamlin was professionally engaged in San
Francisco and Marysville and the transfer of Sophy from the school to
her new home was effected without his supervision From letters received
by him during that interval it seemed that the young girl had entered
energetically upon her new career and that her artistic efforts were
crowned with success There were a few Indianink sketches studies made
at school and expanded in her own studio which were eagerly bought as
soon as exhibited in the photographers windownotably by a florid
and inartistic bookkeeper an old negro woman a slangy stable boy a
gorgeously dressed and painted female and the bearded second officer of
a river steamboat without hesitation and without comment This as Mr
Hamlin intelligently pointed out in a letter to Sophy showed a general
and diversified appreciation on the part of the public Indeed it
emboldened her in the retouching of photographs to offer sittings
to the subjects and to undertake even large crayon copies which had
resulted in her getting so many orders that she was no longer obliged
to sell her drawings but restricted herself solely to profitable
portraiture The studio became known even its quaint surroundings added
to the popular interest and the originality and independence of the
young painter helped her to a genuine success All this she wrote to
Jack Meantime Hannibal had assured him that he had carried out his
instructions by informing Missy of his old masters real occupation
and reputation but that the young lady hadnt took no notice
Certainly there was no allusion to it in her letters nor any indication
in her manner Mr Hamlin was greatly and it seemed to him properly
relieved And he looked forward with considerable satisfaction to an
early visit to old Hannibals laundry

It must be confessed also that another matter a simple affair of
gallantry was giving him an equally unusual unexpected and absurd
annoyance which he had never before permitted to such trivialities
In a recent visit to a fashionable wateringplace he had attracted the
attention of what appeared to be a respectable matter of fact woman
the wife of a recently elected rural Senator She was however
singularly beautiful and as singularly cold It was perhaps this
quality and her evident annoyance at some unreasoning prepossession
which Jacks fascinations exercised upon her that heightened that
reckless desire for risk and excitement which really made up the greater
part of his gallantry Nevertheless as was his habit he had treated
her always with a charming unconsciousness of his own attentions and a
frankness that seemed inconsistent with any insidious approach In fact
Mr Hamlin seldom made love to anybody but permitted it to be made to
him with goodhumored deprecation and cheerful skepticism He had once
quite accidentally while riding come upon her when she had strayed
from her own riding party and had behaved with such unexpected
circumspection and propriety not to mention a certain thoughtful
abstractionit was the day he had received Sophys letterthat she
was constrained to make the first advances This led to a later innocent
rendezvous in which Mrs Camperly was impelled to confide to Mr Hamlin
the fact that her husband had really never understood her Jack listened
with an understanding and sympathy quickened by long experience of such
confessions If anything had ever kept him from marriage it was this
evident incompatibility of the conjugal relations with a just conception
of the feminine soul and its aspirations

And so eventually this yearning for sympathy dragged Mrs Camperlys
clean skirts and rustic purity after Jacks heels into various places
and various situations not so clean rural or innocent made her
miserably unhappy in his absence and still more miserably happy in his
presence impelled her to lie cheat and bear false witness forced her
to listen with mingled shame and admiration to narrow criticism of his
faults from natures so palpably inferior to his own that her moral
sense was confused and shaken gave her two distinct lives but so
unreal and feverish that with a recklessness equal to his own she was
at last ready to merge them both into his For the first time in his
life Mr Hamlin found himself bored at the beginning of an affair
actually hesitated and suddenly disappeared from San Francisco

He turned up a few days later at Aunt Chloes door with various
packages of presents and quite the air of a returning father of a
family to the intense delight of that lady and to Sophys proud
gratification For he was lost in a profuse boyish admiration of her
pretty studio and in wholesome reverence for her art and her astounding
progress They were also amused at his awe and evident alarm at the
portraits of two ladies her latest sitters that were still on
the easels and in consideration of his halfassumed halfreal
bashfulness they turned their faces to the wall Then his quick
observant eye detected a photograph of himself on the mantel

Whats that he asked suddenly

Sophy and Aunt Chloe exchanged meaning glances Sophy had as a surprise
to Jack just completed a handsome crayon portrait of himself from an
old photograph furnished by Hannibal and the picture was at that moment
in the window of her former patronthe photographer

Oh dat Miss Sophy jus put it dar fo de lady sitters to look at to
gib em a pleasant spresshion said Aunt Chloe chuckling

Mr Hamlin did not laugh but quietly slipped the photograph into his
pocket Yet perhaps it had not been recognized

Then Sophy proposed to have luncheon in the studio it was quite
Bohemian and fashionable and many artists did it But to her great
surprise Jack gravely objected preferring the little parlor of Aunt
Chloe the vinefringed windows and the heavy respectable furniture
He thought it was profaning the studio and thenanybody might come in
This unusual circumspection amused them and was believed to be part of
the boyish awe with which Jack regarded the models the draperies and
the studies on the walls Certain it was that he was much more at his
ease in the parlor and when he and Sophy were once more alone at their
meal although he ate nothing he had regained all his old naivete
Presently he leaned forward and placed his hand fraternally on her arm
Sophy looked up with an equally frank smile

You know I promised to let bygones be bygones eh Well I intended it
and moreI intended to make em so I told you Id never speak to you
again of that man who tried to run you off and I intended that no one
else should Well as he was the only one who could talkthat meant
him But the cards are out of my hands the games been played without
me For hes dead

The girl started Mr Hamlins hand passed caressingly twice or thrice
along her sleeve with a peculiar gentleness that seemed to magnetize
her

Dead he repeated slowly Shot in San Diego by another man but not
by me I had him tracked as far as that and had my eyes on him but it
wasnt my deal But there he added giving her magnetized arm a gentle
and final tap as if to awaken it hes dead and so is the whole story
And now well drop it forever

The girls downcast eyes were fixed on the table But theres my
sister she murmured

Did she know you went with him asked Jack

No but she knows I ran away

Well you ran away from home to study how to be an artist dont
you see Some day shell find out you ARE ONE that settles the whole
thing

They were both quite cheerful again when Aunt Chloe returned to
clear the table especially Jack who was in the best spirits with
preternaturally bright eyes and a somewhat rare color on his cheeks
Aunt Chloe who had noticed that his breathing was hurried at times
watched him narrowly and when later he slipped from the room followed
him into the passage He was leaning against the wall In an instant the
negress was at his side

De Lawdy Gawd Marse Jack not AGIN

He took his handkerchief slightly streaked with blood from his lips
and said faintly Yes it came onon the boat but I thought the
dd thing was over Get me out of this quick to some hotel before
she knows it You can tell her I was called away Say thatbut his
breath failed him and when Aunt Chloe caught him like a child in her
strong arms he could make no resistance

In another hour he was unconscious with two doctors at his bedside in
the little room that had been occupied by Sophy It was a sharp attack
but prompt attendance and skillful nursing availed he rallied the next
day but it would be weeks the doctors said before he could be removed
in safety Sophy was transferred to the parlor but spent most of her
time at Jacks bedside with Aunt Chloe or in the studio with the door
open between it and the bedroom In spite of his enforced idleness and
weakness it was again a singularly pleasant experience to Jack it
amused him to sometimes see Sophy at her work through the open door and
when sitters camefor he had insisted on her continuing her duties as
before keeping his invalid presence in the house a secrethe had all
the satisfaction of a mischievous boy in rehearsing to Sophy such of
the conversation as could be overheard through the closed door and
speculating on the possible wonder and chagrin of the sitters had they
discovered him Even when he was convalescent and strong enough to be
helped into the parlor and garden he preferred to remain propped up in
Sophys little bedroom It was evident however that this predilection
was connected with no suggestion nor reminiscence of Sophy herself It
was true that he had once asked her if it didnt make her feel like
home The decided negative from Sophy seemed to mildly surprise him
Thats odd he said now all these fixings and things pointing
to the flowers in a vase the little hanging shelf of books the
knickknacks on the mantelshelf and the few feminine ornaments that
still remained look rather like home to me

So the days slipped by and although Mr Hamlin was soon able to walk
short distances leaning on Sophys arm in the evening twilight along
the river bank he was still missed from the haunts of dissipated men A
good many people wondered and others chiefly of the more irrepressible
sex were singularly concerned Apparently one of these one sultry
afternoon stopped before the shadowed window of a photographers she
was a handsome welldressed woman yet bearing a certain countrylike
simplicity that was unlike the restless smartness of the more urban
promenaders who passed her Nevertheless she had halted before Mr
Hamlins picture which Sophy had not yet dared to bring home and
present to him and was gazing at it with rapt and breathless attention
Suddenly she shook down her veil and entered the shop Could the
proprietor kindly tell her if that portrait was the work of a local
artist

The proprietor was both proud and pleased to say that IT WAS It was the
work of a Miss Brown a young girl student in fact a mere schoolgirl
one might say He could show her others of her pictures

Thanks But could he tell her if this portrait was from life

No doubt the young lady had a studio and he himself had sent her
sitters

And perhaps this was the portrait of one that he had sent her

No but she was very popular and becoming quite the fashion Very
probably this gentleman who he understood was quite a public
character had heard of her and selected her on that account

The ladys face flushed slightly The photographer continued The
picture was not for sale it was only there on exhibition in fact it
was to be returned tomorrow

To the sitter

He couldnt say It was to go back to the studio Perhaps the sitter
would be there

And this studio Could she have its address

The man wrote a few lines on his card Perhaps the lady would be kind
enough to say that he had sent her The lady thanking him partly
lifted her veil to show a charming smile and gracefully withdrew The
photographer was pleased Miss Brown had evidently got another sitter
and from that momentary glimpse of her face it would be a picture as
beautiful and attractive as the mans But what was the odd idea that
struck him She certainly reminded him of some one There was the same
heavy hair only this ladys was golden and she was older and more
mature And he remained for a moment with knitted brows musing over his
counter

Meantime the fair stranger was making her way towards the river suburb
When she reached Aunt Chloes cottage she paused with the unfamiliar
curiosity of a newcomer over its quaint and incongruous exterior She
hesitated a moment also when Aunt Chloe appeared in the doorway and
with a puzzled survey of her features went upstairs to announce a
visitor There was the sound of hurried shutting of doors of the moving
of furniture quick footsteps across the floor and then a girlish laugh
that startled her She ascended the stairs breathlessly to Aunt Chloes
summons found the negress on the landing and knocked at a door which
bore a card marked Studio The door opened she entered there were
two sudden outcries that might have come from one voice

Sophonisba

Marianne

Hush

The woman had seized Sophy by the wrist and dragged her to the window
There was a haggard look of desperation in her face akin to that which
Hamlin had once seen in her sisters eyes on the boat as she said
huskily I did not know YOU were here I came to see the woman who had
painted Mr Hamlins portrait I did not know it was YOU Listen Quick
answer me one question Tell meI implore youfor the sake of the
mother who bore us bothtell meis this the man for whom you left
home

No No A hundred times no

Then there was a silence Mr Hamlin from the bedroom heard no more

An hour later when the two women opened the studio door pale but
composed they were met by the anxious and tearful face of Aunt Chloe

Lawdy Gawd Missybut dey done gonebofe of em

Who is gone demanded Sophy as the woman beside her trembled and grew
paler still

Marse Jack and dat fool nigger Hannibal

Mr Hamlin gone repeated Sophy incredulously When Where

Jess nowon de down boat Sudden business Didnt like to disturb yo
and yo friend Said hed write

But he was illalmost helpless gasped Sophy

Dats why he took dat old nigger Lawdy Missy bress yo heart Dey
both knows aich udder shuah Its all right Dar now dar dey are
listen

She held up her hand A slow pulsation that might have been the dull
labored beating of their own hearts was making itself felt throughout
the little cottage It came nearera deep regular inspiration that
seemed slowly to fill and possess the whole tranquil summer twilight It
was nearer stillwas abreast of the housepassedgrew fainter and at
last died away like a deepdrawn sigh It was the down boat that was
now separating Mr Hamlin and his protegee even as it had once brought
them together




AN INGENUE OF THE SIERRAS


I


We all held our breath as the coach rushed through the semidarkness of
Gallopers Ridge The vehicle itself was only a huge lumbering shadow
its sidelights were carefully extinguished and Yuba Bill had just
politely removed from the lips of an outside passenger even the cigar
with which he had been ostentatiously exhibiting his coolness For it
had been rumored that the Ramon Martinez gang of road agents were
laying for us on the second grade and would time the passage of our
lights across Gallopers in order to intercept us in the brush beyond
If we could cross the ridge without being seen and so get through the
brush before they reached it we were safe If they followed it would
only be a stern chase with the odds in our favor

The huge vehicle swayed from side to side rolled dipped and
plunged but Bill kept the track as if in the whispered words of the
Expressman he could feel and smell the road he could no longer see
We knew that at times we hung perilously over the edge of slopes that
eventually dropped a thousand feet sheer to the tops of the sugarpines
below but we knew that Bill knew it also The half visible heads of the
horses drawn wedgewise together by the tightened reins appeared to
cleave the darkness like a ploughshare held between his rigid
hands Even the hoofbeats of the six horses had fallen into a vague
monotonous distant roll Then the ridge was crossed and we plunged
into the still blacker obscurity of the brush Rather we no longer
seemed to moveit was only the phantom night that rushed by us The
horses might have been submerged in some swift Lethean stream nothing
but the top of the coach and the rigid bulk of Yuba Bill arose above
them Yet even in that awful moment our speed was unslackened it was
as if Bill cared no longer to GUIDE but only to drive or as if the
direction of his huge machine was determined by other hands than his An
incautious whisperer hazarded the paralyzing suggestion of our meeting
another team To our great astonishment Bill overheard it to our
greater astonishment he replied It ud be only a neck and neck
race which would get to hll first he said quietly But we were
relievedfor he had SPOKEN Almost simultaneously the wider turnpike
began to glimmer faintly as a visible track before us the wayside trees
fell out of line opened up and dropped off one after another we were
on the broader tableland out of danger and apparently unperceived and
unpursued

Nevertheless in the conversation that broke out again with the
relighting of the lamps and the comments congratulations and
reminiscences that were freely exchanged Yuba Bill preserved a
dissatisfied and even resentful silence The most generous praise of
his skill and courage awoke no response I reckon the old man waz just
spilin for a fight and is feelin disappointed said a passenger
But those who knew that Bill had the true fighters scorn for any purely
purposeless conflict were more or less concerned and watchful of him He
would drive steadily for four or five minutes with thoughtfully knitted
brows but eyes still keenly observant under his slouched hat and
then relaxing his strained attitude would give way to a movement of
impatience You aint uneasy about anything Bill are you asked
the Expressman confidentially Bill lifted his eyes with a slightly
contemptuous surprise Not about anything ter COME Its what HEZ
happened that I dont exackly sabe I dont see no signs of Ramons gang
ever havin been out at all and ef they were out I dont see why they
didnt go for us

The simple fact is that our ruse was successful said an outside
passenger They waited to see our lights on the ridge and not seeing
them missed us until we had passed Thats my opinion

You aint puttin any price on that opinion air ye inquired Bill
politely

No

Cos thars a comic paper in Frisco pays for them things and Ive
seen worse things in it

Come off Bill retorted the passenger slightly nettled by the
tittering of his companions Then what did you put out the lights for

Well returned Bill grimly it mout have been because I didnt keer
to hev you chaps blazin away at the first bush you THOUGHT you saw move
in your skeer and bringin down their fire on us

The explanation though unsatisfactory was by no means an improbable
one and we thought it better to accept it with a laugh Bill however
resumed his abstracted manner

Who got in at the Summit he at last asked abruptly of the Expressman

Derrick and Simpson of Cold Spring and one of the Excelsior boys
responded the Expressman

And that Pike County girl from Dows Flat with her bundles Dont
forget her added the outside passenger ironically

Does anybody here know her continued Bill ignoring the irony

Youd better ask Judge Thompson he was mighty attentive to her
gettin her a seat by the off window and lookin after her bundles and
things

Gettin her a seat by the WINDOW repeated Bill

Yes she wanted to see everything and wasnt afraid of the shooting

Yes broke in a third passenger and he was so dd civil that
when she dropped her ring in the straw he struck a match agin all your
rules you know and held it for her to find it And it was just as we
were crossin through the brush too I saw the hull thing through the
window for I was hanging over the wheels with my gun ready for action
And it wasnt no fault of Judge Thompsons if his dd foolishness
hadnt shown us up and got us a shot from the gang

Bill gave a short grunt but drove steadily on without further comment
or even turning his eyes to the speaker

We were now not more than a mile from the station at the crossroads
where we were to change horses The lights already glimmered in the
distance and there was a faint suggestion of the coming dawn on the
summits of the ridge to the west We had plunged into a belt of timber
when suddenly a horseman emerged at a sharp canter from a trail that
seemed to be parallel with our own We were all slightly startled Yuba
Bill alone preserving his moody calm

Hullo he said

The stranger wheeled to our side as Bill slackened his speed He seemed
to be a packer or freight muleteer

Ye didnt get held up on the Divide continued Bill cheerfully

No returned the packer with a laugh I dont carry treasure But I
see youre all right too I saw you crossin over Gallopers

SAW us said Bill sharply We had our lights out

Yes but there was suthin whitea handkerchief or womans veil I
reckonhangin from the window It was only a movin spot agin the
hillside but ez I was lookin out for ye I knew it was you by that
Goodnight

He cantered away We tried to look at each others faces and at Bills
expression in the darkness but he neither spoke nor stirred until he
threw down the reins when we stopped before the station The passengers
quickly descended from the roof the Expressman was about to follow but
Bill plucked his sleeve

Im goin to take a look over this yer stage and these yer passengers
with ye afore we start

Why whats up

Well said Bill slowly disengaging himself from one of his enormous
gloves when we waltzed down into the brush up there I saw a man ez
plain ez I see you rise up from it I thought our time had come and the
band was goin to play when he sorter drew back made a sign and we
just scooted past him

Well

Well said Bill it means that this yer coach was PASSED THROUGH FREE
tonight

You dont object to THATsurely I think we were deucedly lucky

Bill slowly drew off his other glove Ive been riskin my everlastin
life on this dd line three times a week he said with mock
humility and Im allus thankful for small mercies BUT he added
grimly when it comes down to being passed free by some pal of a hoss
thief and thet called a speshal Providence I AINT IN IT No sir I
aint in it


II


It was with mixed emotions that the passengers heard that a delay of
fifteen minutes to tighten certain screwbolts had been ordered by the
autocratic Bill Some were anxious to get their breakfast at Sugar Pine
but others were not averse to linger for the daylight that promised
greater safety on the road The Expressman knowing the real cause of
Bills delay was nevertheless at a loss to understand the object of it
The passengers were all well known any idea of complicity with the road
agents was wild and impossible and even if there was a confederate
of the gang among them he would have been more likely to precipitate a
robbery than to check it Again the discovery of such a confederateto
whom they clearly owed their safetyand his arrest would have been
quite against the Californian sense of justice if not actually illegal
It seemed evident that Bills quixotic sense of honor was leading him
astray

The station consisted of a stable a wagon shed and a building
containing three rooms The first was fitted up with bunks or sleeping
berths for the employees the second was the kitchen and the third
and larger apartment was diningroom or sittingroom and was used
as general waitingroom for the passengers It was not a refreshment
station and there was no bar But a mysterious command from the
omnipotent Bill produced a demijohn of whiskey with which he hospitably
treated the company The seductive influence of the liquor loosened the
tongue of the gallant Judge Thompson He admitted to having struck a
match to enable the fair Pike Countian to find her ring which however
proved to have fallen in her lap She was a fine healthy young
womana type of the Far West sir in fact quite a prairie blossom
yet simple and guileless as a child She was on her way to Marysville
he believed although she expected to meet friendsa friend in
factlater on It was her first visit to a large townin fact any
civilized centresince she crossed the plains three years ago Her
girlish curiosity was quite touching and her innocence irresistible
In fact in a country whose tendency was to produce frivolity and
forwardness in young girls he found her a most interesting young
person She was even then out in the stableyard watching the horses
being harnessed preferring to indulge a pardonable healthy young
curiosity than to listen to the empty compliments of the younger
passengers

The figure which Bill saw thus engaged without being otherwise
distinguished certainly seemed to justify the Judges opinion She
appeared to be a wellmatured country girl whose frank gray eyes and
large laughing mouth expressed a wholesome and abiding gratification in
her life and surroundings She was watching the replacing of luggage in
the boot A little feminine start as one of her own parcels was thrown
somewhat roughly on the roof gave Bill his opportunity Now there he
growled to the helper ye aint carting stone Look out will yer Some
of your things miss he added with gruff courtesy turning to her
These yer trunks for instance

She smiled a pleasant assent and Bill pushing aside the helper seized
a large square trunk in his arms But from excess of zeal or some other
mischance his foot slipped and he came down heavily striking
the corner of the trunk on the ground and loosening its hinges and
fastenings It was a cheap commonlooking affair but the accident
discovered in its yawning lid a quantity of white laceedged feminine
apparel of an apparently superior quality The young lady uttered
another cry and came quickly forward but Bill was profuse in his
apologies himself girded the broken box with a strap and declared his
intention of having the company make it good to her with a new one
Then he casually accompanied her to the door of the waitingroom
entered made a place for her before the fire by simply lifting the
nearest and most youthful passenger by the coat collar from the stool
that he was occupying and having installed the lady in it displaced
another man who was standing before the chimney and drawing himself
up to his full six feet of height in front of her glanced down upon his
fair passenger as he took his waybill from his pocket

Your name is down here as Miss Mullins he said

She looked up became suddenly aware that she and her questioner were
the centre of interest to the whole circle of passengers and with a
slight rise of color returned Yes

Well Miss Mullins Ive got a question or two to ask ye I ask it
straight out afore this crowd Its in my rights to take ye aside and
ask itbut that aint my style Im no detective I neednt ask it at
all but act as ef I knowed the answer or I might leave it to be asked
by others Ye neednt answer it ef ye dont like yeve got a friend
over therJudge Thompsonwho is a friend to ye right or wrong jest
as any other man here isas though yed packed your own jury Well the
simple question Ive got to ask ye is THIS Did you signal to anybody
from the coach when we passed Gallopers an hour ago

We all thought that Bills courage and audacity had reached its
climax here To openly and publicly accuse a lady before a group
of chivalrous Californians and that lady possessing the further
attractions of youth good looks and innocence was little short of
desperation There was an evident movement of adhesion towards the
fair stranger a slight muttering broke out on the right but the very
boldness of the act held them in stupefied surprise Judge Thompson
with a bland propitiatory smile began Really Bill I must protest on
behalf of this young ladywhen the fair accused raising her eyes to
her accuser to the consternation of everybody answered with the slight
but convincing hesitation of conscientious truthfulness

I DID

Ahem interposed the Judge hastily erthat iseryou allowed
your handkerchief to flutter from the windowI noticed it
myselfcasuallyone might say even playfullybut without any
particular significance

The girl regarding her apologist with a singular mingling of pride and
impatience returned briefly

I signaled

Who did you signal to asked Bill gravely

The young gentleman Im going to marry

A start followed by a slight titter from the younger passengers was
instantly suppressed by a savage glance from Bill

What did you signal to him for he continued

To tell him I was here and that it was all right returned the young
girl with a steadily rising pride and color

Wot was all right demanded Bill

That I wasnt followed and that he could meet me on the road beyond
Casss Ridge Station She hesitated a moment and then with a still
greater pride in which a youthful defiance was still mingled said

Ive run away from home to marry him And I mean to No one can stop
me Dad didnt like him just because he was poor and dads got money
Dad wanted me to marry a man I hate and got a lot of dresses and things
to bribe me

And youre taking them in your trunk to the other feller said Bill
grimly

Yes hes poor returned the girl defiantly

Then your fathers name is Mullins asked Bill

Its not Mullins IItook that name she hesitated with her first
exhibition of selfconsciousness

Wot IS his name

Eli Hemmings

A smile of relief and significance went round the circle The fame of
Eli or Skinner Hemmings as a notorious miser and usurer had passed
even beyond Gallopers Ridge

The step that youre taking Miss Mullins I need not tell you is
one of great gravity said Judge Thompson with a certain paternal
seriousness of manner in which however we were glad to detect a
glaring affectation and I trust that you and your affianced have fully
weighed it Far be it from me to interfere with or question the natural
affections of two young people but may I ask you what you know of
theeryoung gentleman for whom you are sacrificing so much and
perhaps imperiling your whole future For instance have you known him
long

The slightly troubled air of trying to understandnot unlike the
vague wonderment of childhoodwith which Miss Mullins had received the
beginning of this exordium changed to a relieved smile of comprehension
as she said quickly Oh yes nearly a whole year

And said the Judge smiling has he a vocationis he in business

Oh yes she returned hes a collector

A collector

Yes he collects bills you knowmoney she went on with childish
eagerness not for himselfHE never has any money poor Charleybut
for his firm Its dreadful hard work too keeps him out for days and
nights over bad roads and baddest weather Sometimes when hes stole
over to the ranch just to see me hes been so bad he could scarcely
keep his seat in the saddle much less stand And hes got to take
mighty big risks too Times the folks are cross with him and wont pay
once they shot him in the arm and he came to me and I helped do it
up for him But he dont mind Hes real bravejest as brave as hes
good There was such a wholesome ring of truth in this pretty praise
that we were touched in sympathy with the speaker

What firm does he collect for asked the Judge gently

I dont know exactlyhe wont tell me but I think its a Spanish
firm You seeshe took us all into her confidence with a sweeping
smile of innocent yet halfmischievous artfulnessI only know because
I peeped over a letter he once got from his firm telling him he must
hustle up and be ready for the road the next day but I think the name
was Martinezyes Ramon Martinez

In the dead silence that ensueda silence so profound that we could
hear the horses in the distant stableyard rattling their harnessone
of the younger Excelsior boys burst into a hysteric laugh but the
fierce eye of Yuba Bill was down upon him and seemed to instantly
stiffen him into a silent grinning mask The young girl however
took no note of it Following out with loverlike diffusiveness the
reminiscences thus awakened she went on

Yes its mighty hard work but he says its all for me and as soon as
were married hell quit it He might have quit it before but he wont
take no money of me nor what I told him I could get out of dad That
aint his style Hes mighty proudif he is pooris Charley Why
thars all mas money which she left me in the Savins Bank that I
wanted to draw outfor I had the rightand give it to him but he
wouldnt hear of it Why he wouldnt take one of the things Ive got
with me if he knew it And so he goes on ridin and ridin here and
there and everywhere and gettin more and more played out and sad and
thin and pale as a spirit and always so uneasy about his business and
startin up at times when were meetin out in the South Woods or in the
far clearin and sayin I must be goin now Polly and yet always
tryin to be chiffle and chipper afore me Why he must have rid miles
and miles to have watched for me thar in the brush at the foot of
Gallopers tonight jest to see if all was safe and Lordy Id have
given him the signal and showed a light if Id died for it the next
minit There Thats what I know of Charleythats what Im running
away from home forthats what Im running to him for and I dont
care who knows it And I only wish Id done it aforeand I
wouldifififhed only ASKED ME There now She stopped panted
and choked Then one of the sudden transitions of youthful emotion
overtook the eager laughing face it clouded up with the swift change
of childhood a lightning quiver of expression broke over it andthen
came the rain

I think this simple act completed our utter demoralization We smiled
feebly at each other with that assumption of masculine superiority
which is miserably conscious of its own helplessness at such moments We
looked out of the window blew our noses said Ehwhat and I say
vaguely to each other and were greatly relieved and yet apparently
astonished when Yuba Bill who had turned his back upon the fair
speaker and was kicking the logs in the fireplace suddenly swept down
upon us and bundled us all into the road leaving Miss Mullins alone
Then he walked aside with Judge Thompson for a few moments returned to
us autocratically demanded of the party a complete reticence towards
Miss Mullins on the subjectmatter under discussion reentered the
station reappeared with the young lady suppressed a faint idiotic
cheer which broke from us at the spectacle of her innocent face once
more cleared and rosy climbed the box and in another moment we were
under way

Then she dont know what her lover is yet asked the Expressman
eagerly

No

Are YOU certain its one of the gang

Cant say FOR SURE It mout be a young chap from Yolo who bucked agin
the tiger at Sacramento got regularly cleaned out and busted and
joined the gang for a flier They say thar was a new hand in that job
over at Keeleysand a mighty game one too and ez there was some
buckshot onloaded that trip he might hev got his share and that would
tally with what the girl said about his arm See Ef thats the man
Ive heered he was the son of some big preacher in the States and a
college sharp to boot who ran wild in Frisco and played himself for
all he was worth Theyre the wust kind to kick when they once get
a foot over the traces For stiddy comfble kempany added Bill
reflectively give ME the son of a man that was HANGED

  Gambled at faro

But what are you going to do about this

That depends upon the feller who comes to meet her

But you aint going to try to take him That would be playing it pretty
low down on them both

Keep your hair on Jimmy The Judge and me are only going to rastle
with the sperrit of that gay young galoot when he drops down for his
girland exhort him powful Ef he allows hes convicted of sin and
will find the Lord well marry him and the gal offhand at the next
station and the Judge will officiate himself for nothin Were
goin to have this yer elopement done on the squareand our waybill
cleanyou bet

But you dont suppose hell trust himself in your hands

Polly will signal to him that its all square

Ah said the Expressman Nevertheless in those few moments the men
seemed to have exchanged dispositions The Expressman looked doubtfully
critically and even cynically before him Bills face had relaxed and
something like a bland smile beamed across it as he drove confidently
and unhesitatingly forward

Day meantime although full blown and radiant on the mountain summits
around us was yet nebulous and uncertain in the valleys into which
we were plunging Lights still glimmered in the cabins and few ranch
buildings which began to indicate the thicker settlements And the
shadows were heaviest in a little copse where a note from Judge
Thompson in the coach was handed up to Yuba Bill who at once slowly
began to draw up his horses The coach stopped finally near the junction
of a small crossroad At the same moment Miss Mullins slipped down from
the vehicle and with a parting wave of her hand to the Judge who had
assisted her from the steps tripped down the crossroad and disappeared
in its semiobscurity To our surprise the stage waited Bill holding
the reins listlessly in his hands Five minutes passedan eternity of
expectation and as there was that in Yuba Bills face which forbade
idle questioning an aching void of silence also This was at last
broken by a strange voice from the road

Go on well follow

The coach started forward Presently we heard the sound of other
wheels behind us We all craned our necks backward to get a view of
the unknown but by the growing light we could only see that we were
followed at a distance by a buggy with two figures in it Evidently
Polly Mullins and her lover We hoped that they would pass us But the
vehicle although drawn by a fast horse preserved its distance always
and it was plain that its driver had no desire to satisfy our curiosity
The Expressman had recourse to Bill

Is it the man you thought of he asked eagerly

I reckon said Bill briefly

But continued the Expressman returning to his former skepticism
whats to keep them both from levanting together now

Bill jerked his hand towards the boot with a grim smile

Their baggage

Oh said the Expressman

Yes continued Bill Well hang on to that gals little frills and
fixins until this yer jobs settled and the ceremonys over jest
as ef we waz her own father And whats more young man he added
suddenly turning to the Expressman YOULL express them trunks of
hers THROUGH TO SACRAMENTO with your kempanys labels and hand her the
receipts and checks for them so she CAN GET EM THERE Thatll keep HIM
outer temptation and the reach o the gang until they get away
among white men and civilization again When your hoaryheaded ole
grandfather or to speak plainer that partikler old whiskeysoaker
known as Yuba Bill wot sits on this box he continued with a
diabolical wink at the Expressman waltzes in to pervide for a young
couple jest startin in life thars nothin mean about his style you
bet He fills the bill every time Speshul Providences take a back seat
when hes around

When the station hotel and straggling settlement of Sugar Pine now
distinct and clear in the growing light at last rose within rifleshot
on the plateau the buggy suddenly darted swiftly by us so swiftly
that the faces of the two occupants were barely distinguishable as they
passed and keeping the lead by a dozen lengths reached the door of the
hotel The young girl and her companion leaped down and vanished within
as we drew up They had evidently determined to elude our curiosity and
were successful

But the material appetites of the passengers sharpened by the keen
mountain air were more potent than their curiosity and as the
breakfastbell rang out at the moment the stage stopped a majority of
them rushed into the diningroom and scrambled for places without giving
much heed to the vanished couple or to the Judge and Yuba Bill who had
disappeared also The through coach to Marysville and Sacramento was
likewise waiting for Sugar Pine was the limit of Bills ministration
and the coach which we had just left went no farther In the course of
twenty minutes however there was a slight and somewhat ceremonious
bustling in the hall and on the veranda and Yuba Bill and the Judge
reappeared The latter was leading with some elaboration of manner
and detail the shapely figure of Miss Mullins and Yuba Bill was
accompanying her companion to the buggy We all rushed to the windows to
get a good view of the mysterious stranger and probable exbrigand
whose life was now linked with our fair fellowpassenger I am
afraid however that we all participated in a certain impression of
disappointment and doubt Handsome and even cultivatedlooking he
assuredly wasyoung and vigorous in appearance But there was a certain
halfshamed halfdefiant suggestion in his expression yet coupled with
a watchful lurking uneasiness which was not pleasant and hardly becoming
in a bridegroomand the possessor of such a bride But the frank
joyous innocent face of Polly Mullins resplendent with a simple
happy confidence melted our hearts again and condoned the fellows
shortcomings We waved our hands I think we would have given three
rousing cheers as they drove away if the omnipotent eye of Yuba Bill had
not been upon us It was well for the next moment we were summoned to
the presence of that softhearted autocrat

We found him alone with the Judge in a private sittingroom standing
before a table on which there was a decanter and glasses As we filed
expectantly into the room and the door closed behind us he cast a
glance of hesitating tolerance over the group

Gentlemen he said slowly you was all present at the beginnin of a
little game this mornin and the Judge thar thinks that you oughter
be let in at the finish I dont see that its any of YOUR dd
businessso to speak but ez the Judge here allows youre all in the
secret Ive called you in to take a partin drink to the health of Mr
and Mrs Charley Byngez is now comfably off on their bridal tower
What YOU know or what YOU suspects of the young galoot thats married
the gal aint worth shucks to anybody and I wouldnt give it to a
yaller pup to play with but the Judge thinks you ought all to promise
right here that youll keep it dark Thats his opinion Ez far as my
opinion goes genlmen continued Bill with greater blandness and
apparent cordiality I wanter simply remark in a keerless offhand
ginral way that ef I ketch any Godforsaken lopeared chuckleheaded
blatherin idjet airin HIS opinion

One moment Bill interposed Judge Thompson with a grave smile let
me explain You understand gentlemen he said turning to us the
singular and I may say affecting situation which our goodhearted
friend here has done so much to bring to what we hope will be a happy
termination I want to give here as my professional opinion that there
is nothing in his request which in your capacity as good citizens and
lawabiding men you may not grant I want to tell you also that
you are condoning no offense against the statutes that there is not a
particle of legal evidence before us of the criminal antecedents of Mr
Charles Byng except that which has been told you by the innocent lips
of his betrothed which the law of the land has now sealed forever in
the mouth of his wife and that our own actual experience of his acts
have been in the main exculpatory of any previous irregularityif not
incompatible with it Briefly no judge would charge no jury convict
on such evidence When I add that the young girl is of legal age that
there is no evidence of any previous undue influence but rather of the
reverse on the part of the bridegroom and that I was content as a
magistrate to perform the ceremony I think you will be satisfied to
give your promise for the sake of the bride and drink a happy life to
them both

I need not say that we did this cheerfully and even extorted from Bill
a grunt of satisfaction The majority of the company however who were
going with the through coach to Sacramento then took their leave and
as we accompanied them to the veranda we could see that Miss Polly
Mullinss trunks were already transferred to the other vehicle under the
protecting seals and labels of the allpotent Express Company Then
the whip cracked the coach rolled away and the last traces of the
adventurous young couple disappeared in the hanging red dust of its
wheels

But Yuba Bills grim satisfaction at the happy issue of the episode
seemed to suffer no abatement He even exceeded his usual deliberately
regulated potations and standing comfortably with his back to the
centre of the now deserted barroom was more than usually loquacious
with the Expressman You see he said in bland reminiscence when
your old Uncle Bill takes hold of a job like this he puts it straight
through without changin hosses Yet thar was a moment young feller
when I thought I was stompt It was when wed made up our mind to make
that chap tell the gal fust all what he was Ef shed rared or kicked in
the traces or hung back only ez much ez that wed hev given him jest
five minits law to get up and get and leave her and wed hev toted
that gal and her fixins back to her dad again But she jest gave a
little scream and start and then went off inter hysterics right on
his buzzum laughing and cryin and sayin that nothin should part em
Gosh if I didnt think HE woz more cut up than she about it a minit
it looked as ef HE didnt allow to marry her arter all but that passed
and they was married hard and fastyou bet I reckon hes had enough of
stayin out o nights to last him and ef the valley settlements hevnt
got hold of a very shining member at least the foothills hev got shut
of one more of the Ramon Martinez gang

Whats that about the Ramon Martinez gang said a quiet potential
voice

Bill turned quickly It was the voice of the Divisional Superintendent
of the Express Companya man of eccentric determination of character
and one of the few whom the autocratic Bill recognized as an equalwho
had just entered the barroom His dusty pongee cloak and soft hat
indicated that he had that morning arrived on a round of inspection

Dont care if I do Bill he continued in response to Bills
invitatory gesture walking to the bar Its a little raw out on the
road Well what were you saying about Ramon Martinez gang You havent
come across one of em have you

No said Bill with a slight blinking of his eye as he ostentatiously
lifted his glass to the light

And you WONT added the Superintendent leisurely sipping his liquor
For the fact is the gang is about played out Not from want of a job
now and then but from the difficulty of disposing of the results of
their work Since the new instructions to the agents to identify and
trace all dust and bullion offered to them went into force you see
they cant get rid of their swag All the gang are spotted at the
offices and it costs too much for them to pay a fence or a middleman
of any standing Why all that flaky river gold they took from the
Excelsior Company can be identified as easy as if it was stamped with
the companys mark They cant melt it down themselves they cant
get others to do it for them they cant ship it to the Mint or Assay
Offices in Marysville and Frisco for they wont take it without our
certificate and seals and WE dont take any undeclared freight WITHIN
the lines that weve drawn around their beat except from people and
agents known Why YOU know that well enough Jim he said suddenly
appealing to the Expressman dont you

Possibly the suddenness of the appeal caused the Expressman to swallow
his liquor the wrong way for he was overtaken with a fit of
coughing and stammered hastily as he laid down his glass Yesof
coursecertainly

No sir resumed the Superintendent cheerfully theyre pretty well
played out And the best proof of it is that theyve lately been robbing
ordinary passengers trunks There was a freight wagon held up near
Dows Flat the other day and a lot of baggage gone through I had to
go down there to look into it Darned if they hadnt lifted a lot o
womans wedding things from that rich couple who got married the other
day out at Marysville Looks as if they were playing it rather low down
dont it Coming down to hardpan and the bed rockeh

The Expressmans face was turned anxiously towards Bill who after a
hurried gulp of his remaining liquor still stood staring at the window
Then he slowly drew on one of his large gloves Ye didnt he said
with a slow drawling but perfectly distinct articulation happen to
know old Skinner Hemmings when you were over there

Yes

And his daughter

He hasnt got any

A sort o mild innocent guileless child of nature persisted Bill
with a yellow face a deadly calm and Satanic deliberation

No I tell you he HASNT any daughter Old man Hemmings is a confirmed
old bachelor Hes too mean to support more than one

And you didnt happen to know any o that gang did ye continued
Bill with infinite protraction

Yes Knew em all There was French Pete Cherokee Bob Kanaka
Joe Oneeyed Stillson Softy Brown Spanish Jack and two or three
Greasers

And ye didnt know a man by the name of Charley Byng

No returned the Superintendent with a slight suggestion of weariness
and a distraught glance towards the door

A dark stylish chap with shifty black eyes and a curledup
merstache continued Bill with dry colorless persistence

No Look here Bill Im in a little bit of a hurrybut I suppose
you must have your little joke before we part Now what is your little
game

Wot you mean demanded Bill with sudden brusqueness

Mean Well old man you know as well as I do Youre giving me the
very description of Ramon Martinez himself ha ha NoBill you didnt
play me this time Youre mighty spry and clever but you didnt catch
on just then

He nodded and moved away with a light laugh Bill turned a stony face to
the Expressman Suddenly a gleam of mirth came into his gloomy eyes He
bent over the young man and said in a hoarse chuckling whisper

But I got even after all

How

Hes tied up to that lying little shedevil hard and fast




THE REFORMATION OF JAMES REDDY


I


It was a freshly furrowed field so large that the eye at first
scarcely took in its magnitude The irregular surface of upturned oily
waveshaped clods took the appearance of a vast black chopping sea
that reached from the actual shore of San Francisco Bay to the low hills
of the Coast Range The seabreeze that blew chilly over this bleak
expanse added to that fancy and the line of straggling whitewashed farm
buildings that half way across lifted themselves above it seemed to
be placed on an island in its midst Even the one or two huge misshapen
agricultural machines abandoned in the furrows bore an odd resemblance
to hulks or barges adrift upon its waste

This marine suggestion was equally noticeable from the door of one of
the farm buildingsa long detached wooden shedinto which a number of
farm laborers were slowly filing although one man was apparently enough
impressed by it to linger and gaze over that rigid sea Except in their
rough dress and the laborstains of soil on their hands and faces they
represented no particular type or class They were young and old
robust and delicate dull and intelligent kept together only by some
philosophical careless or humorous acceptance of equally enforced
circumstance in their labors as convicts might have been For they had
been picked up on the streets and wharves of San Franciscodischarged
sailors brokendown miners helpless newcomers unemployed professional
men and ruined tradersto assist in ploughing and planting certain
broad leagues of rich alluvial soil for a speculative Joint Stock
Company at a weekly wage that would have made an European peasant
independent for half a year Yet there was no enthusiasm in their labor
although it was seldom marked by absolute laziness or evasion and was
more often hindered by illregulated spurts and excessive effort
as if the laborer was anxious to get through with it for in the few
confidences they exchanged there was little allusion to the present and
they talked chiefly of what they were going to do when their work was
over They were gregarious only at their meals in one of the sheds or
when at night they sought their bunks or berths together in the larger
building

The man who had lingered to look at the dreary prospect had a somewhat
gloomy discontented face whose sensitive lines indicated a certain
susceptibility to such impressions He was further distinguished by
having also lingered longer with the washing of his hands and face
in the battered tin basin on a stool beside the door and by the
circumstance that the operation revealed the fact that they were whiter
than those of his companions Drying his fingers slowly on the long
rollertowel he stood gazing with a kind of hard abstraction across the
darkening field the strip of faded colorless shore and the chill gray
sea to the dividing point of land on the opposite coast which in the
dying daylight was silhouetted against the cold horizon

He knew that around that point and behind it lay the fierce halfgrown
halftamed city of yesterday that had worked his ruin

It was scarcely a year ago that he had plunged into its wildest
excessesa reckless gambler among speculators a hopeless speculator
among gamblers until the little fortune he had brought thither had been
swept away

From time to time he had kept up his failing spirit with the feverish
exaltation of dissipation until awakening from a drunkards dream one
morning he had found himself on board a steamboat crossing the bay in
company with a gang of farm laborers with whom he was hired A bitter
smile crossed his lips as his eyes hovered over the cold rugged fields
before him Yet he knew that they had saved him The unaccustomed manual
labor in the open air the regular hours the silent heavy passionless
nights the plain but wholesome food were all slowly restoring his
youth and strength again Temptation and passion had alike fled these
unlovely fields and grim employment Yet he was not grateful He nursed
his dreary convalescence as he had his previous dissipation as part of
a wrong done him by one for whose sake he was wont to believe he had
sacrificed himself That person was a woman

Turning at last from the prospect and his bitter memories to join his
companions he found that they had all passed in The benches before the
long table on which supper was spread were already filled and he stood
in hesitation looking down the line of silent and hungrily preoccupied
men on either side A young girl who was standing near a smaller
servingtable apparently assisting an older woman in directing the
operation of half a dozen Chinese waiters moved forward and cleared a
place for him at a sidetable pushing before it the only chair in the
roomthe one she had lately vacated As she placed some of the dishes
before him with a timid ostentation and her large but wellshaped hands
came suddenly in contact with and in direst contrast to his own whiter
and more delicate ones she blushed faintly He lifted his eyes to hers

He had seen her half a dozen times before for she was the daughter of
the ranch superintendent and occasionally assisted her mother in
this culinary supervisionwhich did not however bring her into any
familiar association with the men Even the younger ones perhaps from
overconsciousness of their inferior position or the preoccupation of
their labor never indulged in any gallantry toward her and he himself
in his revulsion of feeling against the whole sex had scarcely noticed
that she was goodlooking But this naive exhibition of preference could
not be overlooked either by his companions who smiled cynically across
the table or by himself from whose morbid fancy it struck an ignoble
suggestion Ah well the girl was prettythe daughter of his employer
who rumor said owned a controlling share in the company why should
he not make this chance preference lead to something if only to
ameliorate in ways like this his despicable position here He knew
the value of his own good looks his superior education and a certain
recklessness which women liked why should he not profit by them as well
as the one woman who had brought him to this He owed her sex nothing
if those among them who were not bad were only fools there was no
reason why he should not deceive them as they had him There was
all this small audacity and cynical purpose in his brown eyes as
he deliberately fixed them on hers And I grieve to say that these
abominable sentiments seemed only to impart to them a certain attractive
brilliancy and a determination which the undetermining sex is apt to
admire

She blushed again dropped her eyes replied to his significant thanks
with a few indistinct words and drew away from the table with a sudden
timidity that was half confession

She did not approach him again during the meal but seemed to have taken
a sudden interest in the efficiency of the waiters generally which she
had not shown before I do not know whether this was merely an effort
at concealment or an awakened recognition of her duty but after the
fashion of her sexand perhaps in contrast to hisshe was kinder
that evening to the average man on account of HIM He did not however
notice it nor did her absence interfere with his now healthy appetite
he finished his meal and only when he rose to take his hat from the
peg above him did he glance around the room Their eyes met again As
he passed out although it was dark he put on his hat a little more
smartly

The air was clear and cold but the outlines of the landscape had
vanished His companions with the instinct of tired animals were
already making their way in knots of two or three or in silent file
across the intervening space between the building and their dormitory
A few had already lit their pipes and were walking leisurely but the
majority were hurrying from the chill seabreeze to the warmth and
comfort of the long welllit room lined with blanketed berths and set
with plain wooden chairs and tables The young man lingered for a moment
on the wooden platform outside the diningshedpartly to evade this
only social gathering of his fellows as they retired for the night and
partly attracted by a strange fascination to the faint distant glow
beyond the point of land which indicated the lights of San Francisco

There was a slight rustle behind him It was the young girl who with a
white woolen scarf thrown over her head and shoulders had just left the
room She started when she saw him and for an instant hesitated

You are going home Miss Woodridge he said pleasantly

Yes she returned in a faint embarrassed voice I thought Id run
on ahead of ma

Will you allow me to accompany you

Its only a step she protested indicating the light in the window of
the superintendents house the most remote of the group of buildings
yet scarcely a quarter of a mile distant

But its quite dark he persisted smilingly

She stepped from the platform to the ground he instantly followed and
ranged himself at a little distance from her side She protested still
feebly against his troubling himself but in another moment they were
walking on quietly together Nevertheless a few paces from the platform
they came upon the upheaved clods of the fresh furrows and their
progress over them was slow and difficult

Shall I help you Will you take my arm he said politely

No thank you Mr Reddy

So she knew his name He tried to look into her eyes but the woolen
scarf hid her head After all there was nothing strange in her
knowing him she probably had the names of the men before her in the
diningroom or on the books After a pause he said

You quite startled me One becomes such a mere working machine here
that one quite forgets ones own nameespecially with the prefix of
Mr

And if it dont happen to be ones real name either said the girl
with an odd timid audacity

He looked up quicklymore attracted by her manner than her words more
amused than angry

But Reddy happens to be my real name

Oh

What made you think it was not

The clods over which they were clambering were so uneven that sometimes
the young girl was mounting one at the same moment that Reddy was
descending from another Her reply half muffled in her shawl was
delivered over his head Oh because pa says most of the men here dont
give their real namesthey dont care to be known afterward Ashamed of
their work I reckon

His face flushed a moment even in the darkness He WAS ashamed of his
work and perhaps a little of the pitiful sport he was beginning But
oddly enough the aggressive criticism only whetted his purpose The
girl was evidently quite able to take care of herself why should he be
overchivalrous

It isnt very pleasant to be doing the work of a horse an ox or a
machine if you can do other things he said half seriously

But you never used to do anything at all did you she asked

He hesitated Here was a chance to give her an affecting history of
his former exalted fortune and position and perhaps even to stir her
evidently romantic nature with some suggestion of his sacrifices to one
of her own sex Women liked that sort of thing It aroused at once
their emulation and their condemnation of each other He seized the
opportunity butfor some reason he knew not whyawkwardly and
clumsily with a simulated pathos that was lachrymose a selfassertion
that was boastful and a dramatic manner that was unreal Suddenly the
girl stopped him

Yes I know all THAT pa told me Told me youd been given away by some
woman

His face again flushedthis time with anger The utter failure of his
story to excite her interest and her perfect possession of herself and
the situationso unlike her conduct a few moments beforemade him
savagely silent and he clambered on sullenly at her side Presently she
stopped balancing herself with a dexterity he could not imitate on one
of the larger upheaved clods and said

I was thinking that as you cant do much with those hands of yours
digging and shoveling and not much with your feet either over ploughed
ground you might do some inside work that would pay you better too
You might help in the dining room setting table and washing up helping
ma and methough I dont do much except overseeing I could show you
what to do at first and youd learn quick enough If you say yes
Ill speak to pa tonight Hell do whatever I say

The rage and shame that filled his breast choked even the bitter laugh
that first rose to his lips If he could have turned on his heel and
left her with marked indignation he would have done so but they were
scarcely half way across the field his stumbling retreat would have
only appeared ridiculous and he was by no means sure that she would not
have looked upon it as merely a confession of his inability to keep
up with her And yet there was something peculiarly fascinating and
tantalizing in the situation She did not see the sardonic glitter in
his eye as he said brutally

Ha and that would give me the exquisite pleasure of being near you

She seemed a little confused even under her enwrappings and in
stepping down her foot slipped Reddy instantly scrambled up to her
and caught her as she was pitching forward into the furrow Yet in the
struggle to keep his own foothold he was aware that she was assisting
him and although he had passed his arm around her waist as if for her
better security it was only through HER firm grasp of his wrists that
he regained his own footing The cloud had fallen back from her head
and shoulders her heavy hair had brushed his cheek and left its
faint odor in his nostrils the rounded outline of her figure had
been slightly drawn against his own His mean resentment wavered her
proposition which at first seemed only insulting now took a vague form
of satisfaction his ironical suggestion seemed a natural expression
Well I say yes then he said with an affected laugh That is if
you think I can manage to do the work it is not exactly in my line you
know Yet he somehow felt that his laugh was feeble and unconvincing

Oh its easy enough said the girl quietly Youve only got to be
cleanand thats in your line I should say

And if I thought it would please you he added with another attempt
at gallantry

She did not reply but moved steadily on he fancied a little more
rapidly They were nearing the house he felt he was losing time and
opportunity The uneven nature of the ground kept him from walking
immediately beside her unless he held her hand or arm Yet an odd
timidity was overtaking him Surely this was the same girl whose
consciousness and susceptibility were so apparent a moment ago yet her
speech had been inconsistent unsympathetic and coldly practical Its
very kind of you he began again scrambling up one side of the furrow
as she descended on the other tototake such an interest inin a
stranger and I wish you knew how she had mounted the ridge again and
stood balancing herself as if waiting for him to finish his sentence
howhow deeplyIIShe dropped quickly down again with the same
movement of uneasy consciousness and he left the sentence unfinished
The house was now only a few yards away he hurried forward but she
reached the wooden platform and stoop upon it first He however at the
same moment caught her hand

I want to thank you he said and say goodnight

Goodnight Her voice was indistinct again and she was trembling
Emboldened and reckless he sprang upon the platform and encircling her
with one arm with his other hand he unloosed the woolen cloud around
her head and bared her faintly flushed cheek and halfopen hurriedly
breathing lips But the next moment she threw her head back with a
single powerful movement and as it seemed to him with scarcely an
effort cast him off with both hands and sent him toppling from the
platform to the ground He scrambled quickly to his feet again flushed
angry andfrightened Perhaps she would call her father he would be
insulted or worselaughed at He had lost even this pitiful chance of
bettering his condition But he was as relieved as he was surprised
to see that she was standing quietly on the edge of the platform
apparently waiting for him to rise Her face was still uncovered still
slightly flushed but bearing no trace of either insult or anger When
he stood erect again she looked at him gravely and drew the woolen
cloud over her head as she said calmly Then Ill tell pa youll take
the place and I reckon youll begin tomorrow morning


II


Angered discomfited and physically and morally beaten James Reddy
stumbled and clambered back across the field The beam of light that had
streamed out over the dark field as the door opened and shut on the
girl left him doubly confused and bewildered In his dull anger and
mortification there seemed only one course for him to pursue He would
demand his wages in the morning and cut the whole concern He would go
back to San Francisco and work there where he at least had friends who
respected his station Yet he ought to have refused the girls offer
before she had repulsed him his retreat now meant nothing and might
even tempt her in her vulgar pique to reveal her rebuff of him He
raised his eyes mechanically and looked gloomily across the dark waste
and distant bay to the opposite shore But the fog had already hidden
the glow of the citys lights and thickening around the horizon
seemed to be slowly hemming him in with the dreary rancho In his
present frame of mind there was a certain fatefulness in this that
precluded his once free agency and to that extent relieved and absolved
HIM of any choice He reached the dormitory and its turneddown lights
in a state of tired and dull uncertainty for which sleep seemed to
offer the only relief He rolled himself in his blankets with an animal
instinct of comfort and shut his eyes but their sense appeared to
open upon Nelly Woodridge as she stood looking down upon him from the
platform Even through the dull pain of his bruised susceptibilities he
was conscious of a strange satisfaction he had not felt before He fell
asleep at last to waken only to the sunlight streaming through the
curtainless windows on his face To his surprise the long shed was empty
and deserted except for a single Chinaman who was sweeping the floor at
the farther end As Reddy started up the man turned and approached him
with a characteristic vague and patient smile

All lity John you sleepee heap Mistel Woodlidge he say you no go
wolkee field allee same Mellikan man You stoppee inside housee allee
same ME Shabbee You come to glubbee grub now pointing to the
distant diningshed and then you washee dish

The full extent of his new degradation flashed upon Reddy with this
added insult of his brother menials implicit equality He understood
it all He had been detached from the fieldworkers and was to come to
a later breakfast perhaps the broken victuals of the first repast
and wash the dishes He remembered his new bargain Very well he
would refuse positively take his dismissal and leave that morning He
hurriedly dressed himself and followed the Chinaman into the open air

The fog still hung upon the distant bay and hid the opposite point But
the sun shone with dry Californian brilliancy over the leaguelong field
around him revealing every detail of the rancho with sharp matter of
fact directness and without the least illusion of distance or romance
The rough unplaned unpainted walls of the dinnershed stood out
clearly before him the halffilled buckets of water on the near
platform and the immense tubs piled with dirty dishes He scowled
darkly as he walked forward conscious nevertheless of the
invigorating discipline of the morning air and the wholesome whip in the
sky above him He entered sharply and aggressively To his relief the
room at first sight seemed like the dormitory he had just left to be
empty But a voice clear dry direct and practical as the morning
itself spoke in his ear Mornin Reddy My daughter says youre
willin to take an indoor job and I reckon speakin square as man
to man its more in your line than what youve bin doin It maynt
be hightoned work but works WORK anyhow you can fix it and the only
difference I kin see is in the work that a man does squarely and the
work that he shirks

But said Reddy hurriedly theres a mistake I came here only to

Work like the others I understand Well you see you CANT You do
your best I know I aint findin fault but it aint in your line
THIS is and the pay is better

But stammered Reddy Miss Woodridge didnt understand

Yes she did returned Woodridge impatiently and she told me She
says shell show you round at first Youll catch on all right Sit down
and eat your breakfast and shell be along before youre through
Ez for ME I must get up and get So long and before Reddy had an
opportunity to continue his protest he turned away

The young man glanced vexatiously around him A breakfast much better in
service and quality than the one he had been accustomed to smoked on the
table There was no one else in the room He could hear the voices of
the Chinese waiters in the kitchen beyond He was healthily hungry
and after a moments hesitation sat down and began his meal He could
expostulate with her afterward and withdraw his promise He was
entitled to his breakfast anyway

Once or twice while thus engaged he heard the door of the kitchen
open and the clipping tread of the Chinese waiters who deposited some
rattling burden on the adjacent tables but he thought it prudent not
to seem to notice them When he had finished the pleasant hesitating
boyish contralto of Miss Woodridge fell upon his ear

When youre ready Ill show you how to begin your work

He turned quickly with a flush of mortification at being discovered
at his repast and his anger returned But as his eyes fell upon
her delicately colored but tranquil face her wellshaped figure
coquettishly and spotlessly cuffed collared and aproned and her clear
blue but halfaverted eyes he again underwent a change She certainly
was very prettythat most seductive prettiness which seemed to be
warmed into life by her consciousness of himself Why should he take her
or himself so seriously Why not play out the farce and let those
who would criticise him and think his acceptance of the work degrading
understand that it was only an affair of gallantry He could afford
to serve Woodridge at least a few weeks for the favor of this Rachel
Forgetful of his rebuff of the night before he fixed his brown eyes on
hers with an audacious levity

Oh yesthe work Let us see it Im ready in name and nature for
anything that Miss Woodridge wants of me Im just dying to begin

His voice was raised slightly with a high comedy jauntiness for
the benefit of the Chinese waiters who might be lingering to see the
Mellican man assume their functions But it failed in effect With
their characteristic calm acceptance of any eccentricity in a foreign
devil they scarcely lifted their eyes The young girl pointed to
a deep basket filled with dishes which had been placed on the larger
table and said without looking at Reddy

You had better begin by checking the crockery That is counting the
pieces separately and then arranging them in sets as they come back from
washing Theres the book to compare them with and to set down what is
broken missing or chipped Youll have a clean towel with you to wipe
the pieces that have not been cleaned enough or if they are too dirty
youll send them back to the kitchen

Couldnt I wash them myself said Reddy continuing his ostentatious
levity

Not yet said the girl with grave hesitation youd break them

She stood watching him as with affected hilarity he began to take the
dishes from the basket But she noticed that in spite of this jocular
simulation his grasp was firm and delicate and that there was no
clatterwhich would have affected her sensitive earas he put them
down She laid a pencil and account book beside him and turned away

But you are not going he said in genuine surprise

Yes she said quietly until you get through checking Then Ill
come back and show you what you have to do next Youre getting on very
well

But that was because you were with me

She colored slightly and without looking at him moved slowly to the
door and disappeared

Reddy went back to his work disappointed but not discomfited He was
getting accustomed to the girls eccentricities Whether it was the
freshness of the morning air and sunlight streaming in at the open
windows the unlookedfor solitude and security of the empty room or
that there was nothing really unpleasant in his occupation he went on
cheerfully checking the dishes narrowly examining them for chips and
cracks and noting them in the book Again discovering that a few were
imperfectly cleaned and wiped he repaired the defect with cold water
and a towel without the least thought of the operation being degrading
He had finished his task in half an hour she had not returned why
should he not go on and set the table As he straightened and turned the
coarse tablecloth he made the discovery that the long table was
really composed of half a dozen smaller ones and that the hideous
parallelogram which had always so offended him was merely the outcome of
carelessness and want of taste Without a moments hesitation he set
at work to break up the monotonous line and rearranged the tables
laterally with small open spaces between them The task was no light
one even for a stronger man but he persevered in it with a newfound
energy until he had changed the whole aspect of the room It looked
larger wider and less crowded its hard practical workhouselike
formality had disappeared He had paused to survey it panting still
with his unusual exertion when a voice broke upon his solitude

Well I wanter know

The voice was not Nellys but that of her mothera largeboned
angular woman of fiftywho had entered the room unperceived The
accents were simply those of surprise but on James Reddys present
sensitive mood coupled with the feeling that here was a new witness
to his degradation he might have resented it but he detected the
handsome reserved figure of the daughter a few steps behind her Their
eyes met wonderful to relate the young girls no longer evaded him
but looked squarely into his with a bright expression of pleasure he
had not seen before He checked himself with a sudden thrill of
gratification

Well I declare continued Mrs Woodridge is that YOUR ideaor
yours Helen

Here Reddy simply pointed out the advantages for serving afforded by the
new arrangement that all the tables were equally and quickly accessible
from the servingtable and sideboard and that it was no longer
necessary to go the whole length of the room to serve the upper table
He tactfully did not refer to the improved appearance of the room

Well as long as it aint mere finikin said the lady graciously and
seems to bring the folks and their vittles nearer togetherwell try
it today It does look kinder CITYFIEDand I reckoned that was all the
good it was But I calkilated you were goin to check the crockery this
morning

Its done said Reddy smilingly handing her the accountbook

Mrs Woodridge glanced over it and then surveyed her new assistant

And you didnt find any plates that were dirty and that had to be sent
back

Yes two or three but I cleaned them myself

Mrs Woodridge glanced at him with a look of approving curiosity but
his eyes were just then seeking her daughters for a more grateful
sympathy All of which the good lady noted and as it apparently
answered the unasked question in her own mind she only uttered the
single exclamation Humph

But the approbation he received later at dinner in the satisfaction
of his old companions with the new arrangement had also the effect
of diverting from him the criticism he had feared they would make
in finding him installed as an assistant to Mrs Woodridge On the
contrary they appeared only to recognize in him some especial
and superior faculty utilized for their comfort and when the
superintendent equally pleased said it was all Reddys own idea no
one doubted that it was this particular stroke of genius which gained
him the obvious promotion If he had still thought of offering his
flirtation with Nelly as an excuse there was now no necessity for any
Having shown to his employers his capacity for the highest and lowest
work they naturally preferred to use his best abilitiesand he
was kept from any menial service His accounts were so carefully and
intelligently rendered that the entire care of the building and its
appointments was intrusted to him At the end of the week Mr Woodridge
took him aside

I say you aint got any job in view arter you finish up here hev ye

Reddy started Scarcely ten days ago he had a hundred projects schemes
and speculations more or less wild and extravagant wherewith he was to
avenge and recoup himself in San Francisco Now they were gone he knew
not where and how He briefly said he had not

Because continued Woodridge Ive got an idea of startin a hotel in
the Oak Grove just on the slope back o the rancho The companys bound
to make some sort o settlement there for the regular hands and the
place is pooty enough for Frisco people who want to run over here and
get set up for a day or two Thars plenty of wood and water up thar
and the companys sure to have a wharf down on the shore Ill provide
the capital if you will put in your time You can sling in ez much
style as you like there this was an allusion to Reddys attempt to
enliven the blank walls with colored pictures from the illustrated
papers and green ceanothus sprays from the slope in fact the more
style the better for them city folks Well you think it over

He did But meantime he seemed to make little progress in his court of
the superintendents daughter He tried to think it was because he had
allowed himself to be diverted by his work but although she always
betrayed the same odd physical consciousness of his presence it was
certain that she never encouraged him She gave him the few directions
that his new occupation still made necessary and looked her approval
of his success But nothing more He was forced to admit that this was
exactly what she might have done as the superintendents daughter to a
deserving employee Whereat for a few days he assumed an air of cold
and ceremonious politeness until perceiving that far from piquing the
girl it seemed to gratify her and even to render her less sensitive
in his company he sulked in good earnest This proving ineffective
alsoexcept to produce a kind of compassionate curiosityhis former
dull rage returned The planting of the rancho was nearly over his
service would be ended next week he had not yet given his answer to
Woodridges proposition he would decline it and cut the whole concern

It was a crisp Sunday morning The breakfast hour was later on that
day to allow the men more time for their holiday which however they
generally spent in cards gossip or reading in their sleeping sheds
It usually delayed Reddys work but as he cared little for the
companionship of his fellows it enabled him without a show of
unsociability to seclude himself in the diningroom And this morning
he was early approached by his employer

Im goin to take the women folks over to Oakdale to church said Mr
Woodridge ef ye keer to join us thars a seat in the wagon and Ill
turn on a couple of Chinamen to do the work for you just now and Nelly
or the old woman will give you a lift this afternoon with the counting
up

Reddy felt instinctively that the invitation had been instigated by the
young girl A week before he would have rejoiced at it a month ago he
would have accepted it if only as a relief to his degraded position but
in the pique of this new passion he almost rudely declined it An hour
later he saw Nelly becomingly and even tastefully dressedwith
the American girls triumphant superiority to her condition and
surroundingsride past in her fathers smart carryall He was
startled to see that she looked so like a lady Then with a new and
jealous inconsistency significant of the progress of his passion he
resolved to go to church too She should see that he was not going to
remain behind like a mere slave He remembered that he had still certain
remnants of his past finery in his trunk he would array himself in
them walk to Oakdale and make one of the congregation He managed to
change his clothes without attracting the attention of his fellows and
set out

The air was pure but keen with none of the languor of spring in
its breath although a few flowers were beginning to star the weedy
wagontracked lane and there was an awakening spice in the wayside
southernwood and myrtle He felt invigorated although it seemed only to
whet his jealous pique He hurried on without even glancing toward the
distant coastline of San Francisco or even thinking of it The bitter
memories of the past had been obliterated by the bitterness of the
present He no longer thought of that woman even when he had
threatened to himself to return to San Francisco he was vaguely
conscious that it was not SHE who was again drawing him there but Nelly
who was driving him away

The service was nearly over when he arrived at the chilly little
corrugatedzinc church at Oakdale but he slipped into one of the back
seats A few worshipers turned round to look at him Among them were the
daughters of a neighboring miller who were slightly exercised over the
unusual advent of a goodlooking stranger with certain exterior signs of
elegance Their excitement was communicated by some mysterious instinct
to their neighbor Nelly Woodridge She also turned and caught his
eye But to all appearances she not only showed no signs of her usual
agitation at his presence but did not seem to even recognize him
In the acerbity of his pique he was for a moment gratified at what he
believed to be the expression of her wounded pride but his uneasiness
quickly returned and at the conclusion of the service he slipped out of
the church with one or two of the more restless in the congregation
As he passed through the aisle he heard the escort of the millers
daughters in response to a whispered inquiry say distinctly Only
the headwaiter over at the companys rancho Whatever hesitating idea
Reddy might have had of waiting at the church door for the appearance
of Nelly vanished before the brutal truth His brow darkened and with
flushed cheeks he turned his back upon the building and plunged into the
woods This time there was no hesitation in his resolve he would
leave the rancho at the expiration of his engagement Even in a higher
occupation he felt he could never live down his reputation there

In his morose abstraction he did not know how long or how aimlessly he
had wandered among the mossy liveoaks his head and shoulders often
imperiled by the downcurving of some huge knotted limb his feet
straying blindly from the faint track over the thickly matted carpet
of chickweed which hid their roots But it was nearly an hour before he
emerged upon a wide open wooded slope and from the distant view of
field and shore knew that he was at Oak Grove the site of Woodridges
projected hotel And there surely at a little distance was
the Woodridges wagon and team tied up to a sapling while the
superintendent and his wife were slowly climbing the slope and
apparently examining the prospect Without waiting to see if Nelly was
with them Reddy instantly turned to avoid meeting them But he had not
proceeded a hundred yards before he came upon that young lady who
had evidently strayed from the party and who was now unconsciously
advancing toward him A rencontre was inevitable

She started slightly and then stopped with all her old agitation and
embarrassment But to his own surprise he was also embarrassed and
even tonguetied

She spoke first

You were at church I didnt quite know you ininthese clothes

In her own finery she had undergone such a change to Reddys
consciousness that he for the first time in their acquaintance now
addressed her as on his own level and as if she had no understanding of
his own feelings

Oh he said with easy bitterness OTHERS did if you did not They
all detected the headwaiter at the Union Companys rancho Even if I
had accepted your kindness in offering me a seat in your wagon it would
have made no difference He was glad to put this construction on
his previous refusal for in the new relations which seemed to be
established by their Sunday clothes he was obliged to soften the
churlishness of that refusal also

I dont think youd look nice setting the table in kid gloves she
said glancing quickly at his finery as if accepting it as the real
issue but you can wear what you like at other times I never found
fault with your working clothes

There was such a pleasant suggestion in her emphasis that his illhumor
softened Her eyes wandered over the opposite grove where her
unconscious parents had just disappeared

Papas very keen about the hotel she continued and is going to
have the workmen break ground tomorrow He says hell have it up in two
months and ready to open if he has to make the men work double time
When youre manager you wont mind what folks say

There was no excuse for his further hesitation He must speak out but
he did it in a halfhearted way

But if I simply go awayWITHOUT being managerI wont hear their
criticism either

What do you mean she said quickly

IveIve been thinking ofof going back to San Francisco he
stammered awkwardly

A slight flush of contemptuous indignation passed over her face and
gave it a strength and expression he had never seen there before Oh
youve not reformed yet then she said under her scornful lashes

I dont understand you he said flushing

Father ought to have told you she went on dryly that that woman has
gone off to the Springs with her husband and you wont see HER at San
Francisco

I dont know what you meanand your father seems to take an
unwarrantable interest in my affairs said Reddy with an anger that he
was conscious however was half simulated

No more than he ought to if he expects to trust you with all HIS
affairs said the girl shortly but you had better tell him you have
changed your mind at once before he makes any further calculations on
your staying Hes just over the hill there with mother

She turned away coldly as she spoke but moved slowly and in the
direction of the hill although she took a less direct trail than
the one she had pointed to him But he followed her albeit still
embarrassedly and with that new sense of respect which had checked his
former surliness There was her strong healthy welldeveloped
figure moving before him but the modish gray dress seemed to give its
pronounced outlines something of the dignity of a goddess Even the firm
hands had the distinguishment of character

You understand he said apologetically that I mean no discourtesy to
your father or his offer Andhe hesitatedneither is my reason what
you would infer

Then what is it she asked turning to him abruptly You know you
have no other place when you leave here nor any chance as good as the
one father offers you You are not fit for any other work and you know
it You have no money to speculate with nor can you get any If you
could you would have never stayed here

He could not evade the appalling truthfulness of her clear eyes He
knew it was no use to lie to her she had evidently thoroughly informed
herself regarding his past more than that she seemed to read his
present thoughts But not all of them No he could startle her still
It was desperate but he had nothing now to lose And she liked the
truthshe should have it

You are right he said shortly these are not my reasons

Then what reason have you

You

Me she repeated incredulously yet with a rising color

Yes YOU I cannot stay here and have you look down upon me

I dont look down on you she said simply yet without the haste of
repelling an unjust accusation Why should I Mother and I have done
the same work that you are doingif thats what you mean and father
who is a man like yourself helped us at first until he could do other
things better She paused Perhaps you think so because YOU looked
down on us when you first came here

But I didnt said Reddy quickly

You did said the young girl quietly Thats why you acted toward me
as you did the night you walked home with me You would not have
behaved in that way to any San Francisco young ladyand Im not one of
yourfastMARRIED WOMEN

Reddy felt the hot blood mount to his cheek and looked away I
was foolish and rudeand I think you punished me at the time he
stammered But you see I was right in saying you looked down on me he
concluded triumphantly

This was at best a feeble sequitur but the argument of the affections
is not always logical And it had its effect on the girl

I wasnt thinking of THAT she said Its that you dont know your
own mind

If I said that I would stay and accept your fathers offer would you
think that I did he asked quickly

I should wait and see what you actually DID do she replied

But if I stayedandandif I told you that I stayed on YOUR
accountto be with you and near you onlywould you think that a
proof He spoke hesitatingly for his lips were dry with a nervousness
he had not known before

I might if you told father you expected to be engaged on those terms
For it concerns HIM as much as me And HE engages you and not I
Otherwise Id think it was only your talk

Reddy looked at her in astonishment There was not the slightest trace
of coyness coquetry or even raillery in her clear honest eyes and
yet it would seem as if she had taken his proposition in its fullest
sense as a matrimonial declaration and actually referred him to her
father He was pleased frightened and utterly unprepared

But what would YOU say Nelly He drew closer to her and held out both
his hands But she retreated a step and slipped her own behind her

Better see what father says first she said quietly You may change
your mind again and go back to San Francisco

He was confused and reddened again But he had become accustomed to her
ways rather perhaps he had begun to recognize the quaint justice that
underlaid them or possibly some better self of his own that had been
buried under bitterness and sloth and struggled into life But whatever
he says he returned eagerly cannot alter my feelings to YOU It can
only alter my position here and you say you are above being influenced
by that Tell me Nellydear Nelly have you nothing to say to me AS
I AM or is it only to your fathers manager that you would speak His
voice had an unmistakable ring of sincerity in it and even startled
himhalf rascal as he was

The young girls clear scrutinizing eyes softened her red resolute
lips trembled slightly and then parted the upper one hovering a little
to one side over her white teeth It was Nellys own peculiar smile and
its serious piquancy always thrilled him But she drew a little farther
back from his brightening eyes her hands still curled behind her and
said with the faintest coquettish toss of her head toward the hill If
you want to see father youd better hurry up

With a sudden determination as new to him as it was incomprehensible
Reddy turned from her and struck forward in the direction of the hill
He was not quite sure what he was going for Yet that he who had only
a moment before fully determined to leave the rancho and her was now
going to her father to demand her hand as a contingency of his remaining
did not strike him as so extravagant and unexpected a denouement as
it was a difficult one He was only concerned HOW and in what way he
should approach him In a moment of embarrassment he hesitated turned
and looked behind him

She was standing where he had left her gazing after him leaning
forward with her hands still held behind her Suddenly as with an
inspiration she raised them both carried them impetuously to her lips
blew him a dozen riotous kisses and then lowering her head like a
colt whisked her skirt behind her and vanished in the cover


III


It was only May but the freshness of early summer already clothed
the great fields of the rancho The old resemblance to a sea was still
there more accented perhaps by the undulations of bluishgreen
grain that rolled from the actual shoreline to the foothills The farm
buildings were half submerged in this glowing tide of color and lost
their uncouth angularity with their hidden rude foundations The same
seabreeze blew chilly and steadily from the bay yet softened and
subdued by the fresh odors of leaf and flower The outlying fringe of
oaks were starred through their underbrush with anemones and dogroses
there were lupines growing rankly in the open spaces and along the
gentle slopes of Oak Grove daisies were already scattered And as if it
were part of this vernal efflorescence the eminence itself was crowned
with that latest flower of progress and improvementthe new Oak Grove
Hotel

Long low dazzling with white colonnades verandas and balconies which
retained however enough of the dampness of recent creation to make
them too cool for loungers except at high noon the hotel nevertheless
had the charms of freshness youth and cleanliness Reddys fastidious
neatness showed itself in all the appointments from the mirrored and
marbled barroom gilded parlors and snowy diningroom to the chintz
and maple furnishing of the bedrooms above Reddys taste too had
selected the pretty site his good fortune had afterward discovered
in an adjoining thicket a spring of blandly therapeutic qualities A
complaisant medical faculty of San Francisco attested to its merits
a sympathetic press advertised the excellence of the hotel a
noveltyseeking fashionable circleas yet without laws and blindly
imitativefound the new hotel an admirable variation to the vulgar
ordinary across the bay excursion and an accepted excuse for a novel
social dissipation A number of distinguished people had already visited
it certain exclusive families had secured the best rooms there were a
score of pretty women to be seen in its parlors there had already been
a slight scandal Nothing seemed wanting to insure its success

Reddy was passing through the little wood where four months before he
had parted from Kelly Woodridge to learn his fate from her father He
remembered that interview to which Nellys wafted kiss had inspired
him He recalled today as he had many times before the singular
complacency with which Mr Woodridge had received his suit as if it
were a slight and unimportant detail of the business in hand and how he
had told him that Kelly and her mother were going to the States for a
three months visit but that after her return if they were both still
agreed he Woodridge would make no objection He remembered the
slight shock which this announcement of Kellys separation from him
during his probationary labors had given him and his sudden suspicion
that he had been partly tricked of his preliminary intent to secure her
company to solace him But he had later satisfied himself that she
knew nothing of her fathers intentions at the time and he was fain to
content himself with a walk through the fields at her side the day she
departed and a single kisswhich left him cold And now in a few days
she would return to witness the successful fufillment of his labors
andreward him

It was certainly a complacent prospect He could look forward to a
sensible prosperous respectable future He had won back his good
name his fortune and positionnot perhaps exactly in the way he
had expectedand he had stilled the wanton foolish cravings of his
passionate nature in the calm virginal love of an honest handsome girl
who would make him a practical helpmeet and a comfortable trustworthy
wife He ought to be very happy He had never known such perfect health
before he had lost his reckless habits his handsome nervous face had
grown more placid and contented his long curls had been conventionally
clipped he had gained flesh unmistakably and the lower buttons of
the slim waistcoat he had worn to church that memorable Sunday were too
tight for comfort or looks HE WAS happy yet as he glanced over the
material spring landscape full of practical health blossom and
promise of fruition it struck him that the breeze that blew over it was
chilly even if healthful and he shivered slightly

He reached the hotel entered the office glanced at the register and
passed through into his private room He had been away for two days
and noticed with gratification that the influx of visitors was still
increasing His clerk followed into the room

Theres a lady in 56 who wanted to see you when you returned She asked
particularly for the manager

Who is she

Dont know Its a Mrs Merrydew from Sacramento Expecting her
husband on the next steamer

Humph Youll have to be rather careful about these solitary married
women We dont want another scandal you know

She asked for you by name sir and I thought you might know her
returned the clerk

Very well Ill go up

He sent a waiter ahead to announce him and leisurely mounted the
stairs No 56 was the sittingroom of a private suite on the first
floor The waiter was holding the door open As he approached it a
faint perfume from the interior made him turn pale But he recovered his
presence of mind sufficiently to close the door sharply upon the waiter
behind him

Jim said a voice which thrilled him

He looked up and beheld what any astute reader of romance will have
already suspectedthe woman to whom he believed he owed his ruin in
San Francisco She was as beautiful and alluring as ever albeit she was
thinner and more spiritual than he had ever seen her She was tastefully
dressed as she had always been a certain style of languorous silken
deshabille which she was wont to affect in better health now became her
paler cheek and feverishly brilliant eyes There was the same opulence
of lace and ornament and whether by accident or design clasped around
the slight wrist of her extended hand was a bracelet which he remembered
had swept away the last dregs of his fortune

He took her hand mechanically yet knowing whatever rage was in his
heart he had not the strength to refuse it

They told me it was Mrs Merrydew he stammered

That was my mothers name she said with a little laugh I thought
you knew it But perhaps you didnt When I got my divorce from
Dickyou didnt know that either I suppose its three months agoI
didnt care to take my maiden name again too many people remembered
it So after the decree was made I called myself Mrs Merrydew You had
disappeared They said you had gone East

But the clerk says you are expecting your HUSBAND on the steamer What
does this mean Why did you tell him that He had so far collected
himself that there was a ring of inquisition in his voice

Oh I had to give him some kind of reason for my being alone when I did
not find you as I expected she said half wearily Then a change came
over her tired face a smile of mingled audacity and tentative coquetry
lit up the small features Perhaps it is true perhaps I may have a
husband coming on the steamerthat depends Sit down Jim

She let his hand drop and pointed to an armchair from which she had
just risen and sank down herself in a corner of the sofa her thin
fingers playing with and drawing themselves through the tassels of the
cushion

You see Jim as soon as I was free Louis Sylvesteryou remember
Louis Sylvesterwanted to marry me and even thought that he was the
cause of Dicks divorcing me He actually went East to settle up some
property he had left him there and hes coming on the steamer

Louis Sylvester repeated Reddy staring at her Why he was a bigger
fool than I was and a worse man he added bitterly

I believe he was said the lady smiling and I think he still
is But she added glancing at Reddy under her light fringed lids
youyoure regularly reformed arent you Youre stouter too and
altogether more solid and commercial looking Yet whod have thought of
your keeping a hotel or ever doing anything but speculate in wildcat
or play at draw poker How did you drift into it Come tell me Im not
Mrs Sylvester just yet and maybe I might like to go into the business
too You dont want a partner do you

Her manner was light and irresponsible or rather it suggested a
childlike putting of all responsibility for her actions upon others
which he remembered now too well Perhaps it was this which kept him
from observing that the corners of her smiling lips however twitched
slightly and that her fingers twisting the threads of the tassel
were occasionally stiffened nervously For he burst out Oh yes he had
drifted into it when it was a toss up if it wasnt his body instead
that would be found drifting out to sea from the first wharf of San
Francisco Yes he had been a common laborera farm hand in those
fields she had passeda waiter in the farm kitchen and but for luck
he might be taking her orders now in this very hotel It was not her
fault if he was not in the gutter

She raised her thin hand with a tired gesture as if to ward off the
onset of his words The same old Jim she repeated and yet I thought
you had forgotten all that now and become calmer and more sensible
since you had taken flesh and grown so matter of fact You ought to have
known then as you know now that I never could have been anything to
you as long as I was tied to Dick And you know you forced your presents
on me Jim I took them from YOU because I would take nothing from Dick
for I hated him And I never knew positively that you were in straits
then you know you always talked big Jim and were always going to make
your fortune with the next thing you had in hand

It was true and he remembered it He had not intended this kind of
recrimination but he was exasperated with her wearied acceptance of his
reproaches and by a sudden conviction that his longcherished grievance
against her now that he had voiced it was inadequate mean and
trifling Yet he could not help saying

Then you had presents from Sylvester too I presume you did not hate
him either

He would have married me the day after I got my divorce

And so would I burst out Reddy

She looked at him fixedly You would she said with a peculiar
emphasis And now

He colored It had been part of his revengeful purpose on seeing her to
tell her of his engagement to Kelly He now found himself tonguetied
irresolute and ashamed Yet he felt she was reading his innermost
thoughts

She however only lowered her eyes and with the same tired expression
said No matter now Let us talk of something nearer That was two
months ago And so you have charge of this hotel I like it so much I
mean the place itself I fancy I could live here forever It is so far
away and restful I am so sick of towns and cities and people And this
little grove is so secluded If one had merely a little cottage here
one might be so happy

What did she meanwhat did she expectwhat did she think of doing
She must be got rid of before Kellys arrival and yet he found himself
wavering under her potent and yet scarcely exerted influence The
desperation of weakness is apt to be more brutal than the determination
of strength He remembered why he had come upstairs and blurted out
But you cant stay here The rules are very stringent in regard toto
strangers like yourself It will be known who you really are and what
people say of you Even your divorce will tell against you Its all
wrong I knowbut what can I do I didnt make the rules I am only a
servant of the landlord and must carry them out

She leaned back against the sofa and laughed silently But she presently
recovered herself although with the same expression of fatigue Dont
be alarmed my poor Jim If you mean your friend Mr Woodridge I
know him It was he himself who suggested my coming here And
dont misunderstand himnor me either Hes only a good friend of
Sylvesters they had some speculation together Hes coming here to see
me after Louis arrives Hes waiting in San Francisco for his wife and
daughter who come on the same steamer So you see you wont get into
trouble on my account Dont look so scared my dear boy

Does he know that you knew me said Reddy with a white face

Perhaps But then that was three months ago returned the lady
smiling and you know how you have reformed since and grown ever so
much more steady and respectable

Did he talk to you of me continued Reddy still aghast

A littlecomplimentary of course Dont look so frightened I didnt
give you away

Her laugh suddenly ceased and her face changed into a more nervous
activity as she rose and went toward the window She had heard the sound
of wheels outsidethe coach had just arrived

Theres Mr Woodridge now she said in a more animated voice The
steamer must be in But I dont see Louis do you

She turned to where Reddy was standing but he was gone

The momentary animation of her face changed She lifted her shoulders
with a half gesture of scorn but in the midst of it suddenly threw
herself on the sofa and buried her face in her hands

A few moments elapsed with the bustle of arrival in the hall and
passages Then there was a hesitating step at her door She quickly
passed her handkerchief over her wet eyes and resumed her former look
of weary acceptation The door opened But it was Mr Woodridge who
entered The rough shirtsleeved ranchman had developed during the last
four months into an equally blunt but soberly dressed proprietor His
keen energetic face however wore an expression of embarrassment and
anxiety with an added suggestion of a half humorous appreciation of it

I wouldnt have disturbed you Mrs Merrydew he said with a gentle
bluntness if I hadnt wanted to ask your advice before I saw Reddy
Im keeping out of his way until I could see you I left Nelly and her
mother in Frisco Theres been some queer goingson on the steamer
coming home Kelly has sprang a new game on her mother andand suthin
that looks as if there might be a new deal However here a sense that
he was perhaps treating his statement too seriously stopped him and
he smiled reassuringly that is as may be

I dont know he went on as I ever told you anything about my Kelly
and Reddypartiklerly about Kelly Shes a good girl a square girl
but shes got some allfired romantic ideas in her head Mebbee it kem
from her reading mebbee it kem from her not knowing other girls or
seeing too much of a queer sort of men but she got an interest in the
bad ones and thought it was her mission to reform themreform them
by pure kindness attentive little sisterly ways and moral example She
first tried her hand on Reddy When he first kem to us he waswell he
was a blazin ruin She took him in hand yanked him outer himself put
his foot on the bedrock and made him what you see him now Wellwhat
happened why he got reglarly soft on her wanted to MARRY HER and
I agreed conditionally of course to keep him up to the mark Did you
speak

No said the lady with her bright eyes fixed upon him

Well that was all well and good and Id liked to have carried out my
part of the contract and was willing and am still But you see Kelly
after shed landed Reddy on firm ground got a little tired I reckon
gallike of the thing shed worked so easily and when she went East
she looked around for some other wreck to try her hand on and she found
it on the steamer coming back And who do you think it was Why our
friend Louis Sylvester

Mrs Merrydew smiled slightly with her bright eyes still on the
speaker

Well you know he IS fast at timesif he is a friend of mineand she
reglarly tackled him and as my old woman says it was a sight to see
her go for him But then HE didnt tumble to it No Reformin aint in
HIS line Im afeard And what was the result Why Kelly only got all
the more keen when she found she couldnt manage him like Reddyand
between you and me shed have liked Reddy more if he hadnt been so
easyand its ended I reckon in her now falling dead in love with
Sylvester She swears she wont marry any one else and wants to devote
her whole life to him Now whats to be done Reddy dont know it yet
and I dont know how to tell him Kelly says her mission was ended when
she made a new man of him and he oughter be thankful for that Couldnt
you kinder break the news to him and tell him there aint any show for
him

Does he love the girl so much then said the lady gently

Yes but I am afraid there is no hope for Reddy as long as she thinks
theres a chance of her capturing Sylvester

The lady rose and went to the writingtable Would it be any comfort
to you Mr Woodridge if you were told that she had not the slightest
chance with Sylvester

Yes

She wrote a few lines on a card put it in an envelope and handed it to
Woodridge Find out where Sylvester is in San Francisco and give him
that card I think it will satisfy you And now as I have to catch the
return coach in ten minutes I must ask you to excuse me while I put my
things together

And you wont first break the news to Reddy for me

No and I advise you to keep the whole matter to yourself for the
present Goodby

She smiled again fascinatingly as usual but as it seemed to him a
trifle wearily and then passed into the inner room Years after in his
practical matter of fact recollections of this strange woman he always
remembered her by this smile

But she had sufficiently impressed him by her parting adjuration to
cause him to answer Reddys eager inquiries with the statement that
Kelly and her mother were greatly preoccupied with some friends in
San Francisco and to speedily escape further questioning Reddys
disappointment was somewhat mitigated by the simultaneous announcement
of Mrs Merrydews departure But he was still more relieved and
gratified to hear a few days later of the marriage of Mrs Merrydew
with Louis Sylvester If to the general surprise and comment it
excited he contributed only a smile of cynical toleration and superior
selfcomplacency the reader will understand and not blame him Nor did
the public who knew the austere completeness of his reform Nor did Mr
Woodridge who failed to understand the only actor in this little comedy
who might perhaps have differed from them all

A month later James Reddy married Kelly Woodridge in the chilly little
church at Oakdale Perhaps by that time it might have occurred to him
that although the freshness and fruition of summer were everywhere the
building seemed to be still unwarmed And when he stepped forth with his
bride and glanced across the prosperous landscape toward the distant
bay and headlands of San Francisco he shivered slightly at the dryly
practical kiss of the keen northwestern Trades

But he was prosperous and comfortable thereafter as the respectable
owner of broad lands and paying shares It was said that Mrs Reddy
contributed much to the popularity of the hotel by her charming freedom
from prejudice and sympathy with mankind but this was perhaps only due
to the contrast to her more serious and at times abstracted husband At
least this was the charitable opinion of the proverbially tolerant and
kindhearted Baroness Streichholzer nee Merrydew and relict of the
late lamented Louis Sylvester Esq whom I recently had the pleasure
of meeting at Wiesbaden where the waters and reposeful surroundings
strongly reminded her of Oakdale




THE HEIR OF THE McHULISHES


I


The consul for the United States of America at the port of St Kentigern
was sitting alone in the settled gloom of his private office Yet it was
only high noon of a seasonable winters day by the face of the clock
that hung like a pallid moon on the murky wall opposite to him What
else could be seen of the apartment by the faint light that struggled
through the pall of fog outside the lustreless windows presented the
ordinary aspect of a business sanctum There were a shelf of fogbound
admiralty law one or two colored prints of ocean steamships under
full steam bow on tremendously foreshortened and seeming to force
themselves through shadowy partitions there were engravings of Lincoln
and Washington as unsubstantial and shadowy as the dead themselves
Outside against the window which was almost level with the street
an occasional procession of black silhouetted figures of men and women
with prayerbooks in their hands and gloom on their faces seemed to be
born of the fog and prematurely to return to it At which a conviction
of sin overcame the consul He remembered that it was the Sabbath day
and that he had no business to be at the consulate at all

Unfortunately with this shameful conviction came the sound of a bell
ringing somewhere in the depths of the building and the shuffling of
feet on the outer steps The light of his fire had evidently been seen
and like a beacon had attracted some wandering and possibly intoxicated
mariner with American papers The consul walked into the hall with a
sudden righteous frigidity of manner It was one thing to be lounging
in ones own office on the Sabbath day and quite another to be
deliberately calling there on business

He opened the front door and a middleaged man entered accompanying
and partly shoving forward a more diffident and younger one Neither
appeared to be a sailor although both were dressed in that dingy
respectability and remoteness of fashion affected by second and third
mates when ashore They were already well in the hall and making their
way toward the private office when the elder man said with an air
of casual explanation Lookin for the American consul I reckon this
yers the consulate

It is the consulate said the official dryly and I am the consul
but

Thats all right interrupted the stranger pushing past him and
opening the door of the private office into which he shoved his
companion Thar now he continued to the diffident youth pointing to
a chair and quite ignoring the presence of the consul thars a bit
of America Sit down thar Youre under the flag now and can do as
you darn please Nevertheless he looked a little disappointed as he
glanced around him as if he had expected a different environment and
possibly a different climate

I presume said the consul suavely you wish to see me on some urgent
matter for you probably know that the consulate is closed on Sunday to
ordinary business I am here myself quite accidentally

Then you dont live here said the visitor disappointedly

No

I reckon thats the reason why we didnt see no flag aflyin when we
was ahuntin this place yesterday We were directed here but I says to
Malcolm says I No it aint here or youd see the Stars and Stripes
afore youd see anythin else But I reckon you float it over your
house eh

The consul here explained smilingly that he did NOT fly a flag over his
lodgings and that except on national holidays it was not customary to
display the national ensign on the consulate

Then you cant do hereand you a CONSULwhat any nigger can do in the
States eh Thats about how it pans out dont it But I didnt think
YOUD tumble to it quite so quick Jack

At this mention of his Christian name the consul turned sharply on the
speaker A closer scrutiny of the face before him ended with a flash
of reminiscence The fog without and within seemed to melt away he was
standing once more on a Western hillside with this man a hundred miles
of sparkling sunshine and crisp dry air stretching around him and
above a blue and arched sky that roofed the third of a continent with
six months summer And then the fog seemed to come back heavier and
thicker to his consciousness He emotionally stretched out his hand to
the stranger But it was the fog and his personal surroundings which now
seemed to be unreal

Why its Harry Custer he said with a laugh that however ended in
a sigh I didnt recognize you in this half light He then glanced
curiously toward the diffident young man as if to identify another
possible old acquaintance

Well I spotted you from the first said Custer though I aint seen
you since we were in Scotts Camp together Thats ten years ago Youre
lookin at HIM he continued following the consuls wandering eye
Well its about him that I came to see you This yers a McHulisha
genuine McHulish

He paused as if to give effect to this statement But the name
apparently offered no thrilling suggestion to the consul who regarded
the young man closely for further explanation He was a fairfaced youth
of about twenty years with pale reddishbrown eyes dark hair reddish
at the roots and a singular white and pink waxiness of oval cheek
which however narrowed suddenly at the angle of the jaw and fell away
with the retreating chin

Yes continued Custer I oughter say the ONLY McHulish He is the
direct heirand of royal descent Hes one of them McHulishes whose
name in them old history times was enough to whoop up the boys and make
em paint the town red A regular campaign boomerthe old McHulish was
Stump speeches and brassbands warnt in it with the boys when HE was
around Theyd go their bottom dollar and last cartridgeif theyd had
cartridges in them dayson him That was the regular McHulish gait And
Malcolm theres the last of emgot the same style of features too

Ludicrous as the situation was it struck the consul dimly as
through fog and darkness that the features of the young man were not
unfamiliar and indeed had looked out upon him dimly and vaguely at
various times from various historic canvases It was the face of
complacent fatuity incompetency and inconstancy which had dragged
down strength competency and constancy to its own idiotic fate and
levelsa face for whose weaknesses valor and beauty had not only
sacrificed themselves but made things equally unpleasant to a great
many minor virtues Nevertheless the consul with an amused sense of
its ridiculous incongruity to the grim Scottish Sabbath procession in
the street and the fogbound volumes of admiralty law in the room
smiled affably

Of course our young friend has no desire to test the magic of his name
here in these degenerate days

No said Custer complacently though between you and me old man
theres always no tellin what might turn up over in this yer monarchy
Things of course are different over our way But jest now Malcolm will
be satisfied to take the title and property to which hes rightful
heir

The consuls face fell Alas it was only the old old story Its
endless repetitions and variations had been familiar to him even in his
youth and in his own land Ef that man had his rights had once been
pointed out to him in a wild Western camp hed be now sittin in
scarlet on the right of the Queen of England The gentleman who was
indicated in this apocalyptical vision it appeared simply bore a
singular likeness to a reigning Hanoverian family which for some
unexplained reason he had contented himself with bearing with fortitude
and patience But it was in his official capacity that the consuls
experience had been the most trying At times it had seemed to him that
much of the real property and peerage of Great Britain was the inherited
right of penniless American republicans who had hitherto refrained
from presenting their legal claims and that the habitual first duty of
generations of British noblemen on coming into their estates and titles
was to ship their heirs and next of kin to America and then forget all
about them He had listened patiently to claims to positions more
or less exaltedclaims often presented with ingenuous sophistry or
pathetic simplicity prosecuted with great good humor and abandoned
with invincible cheerfulness but they seldom culminated more seriously
than in the disbursement of a few dollars by the consul to enable the
rightful owner of millions to procure a steerage passage back to his
previous democratic retirement There had been others less sincere but
more pretentious in quality to whom however a letter to the Heralds
College in London was all sufficient and who on payment of various
fees and emoluments were enabled to stagger back to New York or Boston
with certain unclaimed and forgotten luggage which a more gallant
ancestor had scorned to bring with him into the new life or had thrown
aside in his undue haste to make them citizens of the republic Still
all this had grown monotonous and wearisome and was disappointing
as coming through the intervention of an old friend who ought to know
better

Of course you have already had legal opinion on the subject over
there said the consul with a sigh but here you know you ought
first to get some professional advice from those acquainted with Scotch
procedure But perhaps you have that too

No said Custer cheerfully Why it aint only two months ago that
I first saw Malcolm Tumbled over him on his own farm jest out of
MacCorkleville Kentucky where he and his fathers before him had been
livin nigh a hundred yearsyes A HUNDRED YEARS by Jove ever since
they first emigrated to the country Had a talk over it saw an old
Bible about as big and as used up as thatlifting the wellworn
consular Biblewith dates in it and heard the whole story And here
we are

And you have consulted no lawyer gasped the consul

The McHulishes said an unexpected voice that sounded thin and
feminine never took any legal decision From the craggy summits of
Glen Crankie he lifted the banner of his forefathers or raised the
warcry Hulish dhu ieroe from the battlements of Craigiedurrach
And the clan gathered round him with shouts that rent the air That was
the way of it in old times And the boys whooped him up and stood by
him It was the diffident young man who had half spoken half recited
with an odd enthusiasm that even the culminating slang could not make
conventional

Thats about the size of it said Custer leaning back in his chair
easily with an approving glance at the young man And I dont know if
that aint the way to work the thing now

The consul stared hopelessly from the one to the other It had always
seemed possible that this dreadful mania might develop into actual
insanity and he had little doubt but that the younger mans brain
was slightly affected But this did not account for the delusion and
expectations of the elder Harry Custer as the consul remembered him
was a levelheaded practical miner whose leaning to adventure and
excitement had not prevented him from being a cool speculator and he
had amassed more than a competency by reason of his judicious foresight
and prompt action Yet he was evidently under the glamour of this
madman although outwardly as lazily selfcontained as ever

Do you mean to tell me said the consul in a suppressed voice that
you two have come here equipped only with a statement of facts and
a family Bible and that you expect to take advantage of a feudal
enthusiasm which no longer existsand perhaps never did exist out of
the pages of romanceas a means of claiming estates whose titles have
long since been settled by law and can be claimed only under that
tenure Surely I have misunderstood you You cannot be in earnest

Honest Injun said Custer nodding his head lazily We mean it but
not jest that way youve put it Fr instance it aint only us two
This yer thing ole pard were runnin as a syndicate

A syndicate echoed the consul

A syndicate repeated Custer Half the boys that were at Eagle Camp
are in it and two of Malcolms neighbors from Kentuckythe regular
old Scotch breed like himself for you know that MacCorkle County
was settled by them old Scotch Covenanters and the folks are Scotch
Presbyterians to this day And for the matter of that the Eagle boys
that are in it are of Scotch descent or a kind of blend you know in
fact Im half Scotch myselfor Irish he added thoughtfully So
you see that settles your argument about any local opinion for if them
Scots dont know their own people who does

May I ask said the consul with a desperate attempt to preserve his
composure what you are proposing to do

Well said Custer settling himself comfortably back in his chair
again that depends Do you remember the time that we jumped them
Mexican claims on the North Forkthe time them greasers wanted to take
in the whole riverbank because theyd found gold on one of the upper
bars Seems to me we jest went peacefullike over there one moonshiny
night and took up THEIR stakes and set down OURS Seems to me YOU were
one of the party

That was in our own country returned the consul hastily and was an
indefensible act even in a lawless frontier civilization But you are
surely not mad enough even to conceive of such a thing HERE

Keep your hair on Jack said Custer lazily Whats the matter with
constitutional methods eh Do you remember the time when we didnt like
Pueblo rules and we laid out Eureka City on their lines and whooped up
the Mexicans and diggers to elect mayor and aldermen and put the city
front on Juanita Creek and then corraled it for water lots Seems to
me you were county clerk then Now whos to keep Dick Macgregor and Joe
Hamilton that are both up the Nile now from droppin in over here to
see Malcolm in his own house Whos goin to object to Wallace or Baird
who are on this side doin the Eytalian lakes from comin here on
their way home or Watson and Moore and Timley that are livin over in
Paris from joinin the boys in givin Malcolm a housewarmin in his old
home Whats to keep the whole syndicate from gatherin at Kelpie Island
up here off the west coast among the tombs of Malcolms ancestors and
fixin up things generally with the clan

Only one thing said the consul with a gravity which he nevertheless
felt might be a mistaken attitude You shouldnt have told ME about
it For if as your old friend I cannot keep you from committing an
unconceivable folly as the American consul here it will be my first
duty to give notice to our legation and perhaps warn the authorities
And you may be sure I will do it

To his surprise Custer leaned forward and pressed his hand with an
expression of cheerful relief Thats so old pard I reckoned on it
In fact I told Malcolm that that would be about your gait Of course
you couldnt do otherwise And it would have been playin it rather low
down on you to have left you out in the coldwithout even THAT show in
the game For what you will do in warnin the other fellows dont you
see will just waken up the clan Its better than a campaign circular

Dont be too sure of that said the consul with a halfhysterical
laugh But we wont consider so lamentable a contingency Come and
dine with me both of you and well discuss the only thing worth
discussingyour LEGAL rightsand you can tell me your whole story
which by the way I havent heard

Sorry Jack but it cant be done said Custer with his first
approach to seriousness of manner You see wed made up our mind not
to come here again after this first call We aint goin to compromise
you

I am the best judge of that returned the consul dryly Then suddenly
changing his manner he grasped Custers hands with both his own Come
Harry he said earnestly I will not believe that this is not a joke
but I beg of you to promise me one thingdo not move a step further in
this matter without legal counsel I will give you a letter to a legal
friend of minea man of affairs a man of the world and a Scot as
typical perhaps as any you have mentioned State your LEGAL case
to himonly that but his opinion will show you also if I am not
mistaken the folly of your depending upon any sectional or historical
sentiment in this matter

Without waiting for a reply he sat down and hastily wrote a few lines
to a friendly local magnate When he had handed the note to Custer the
latter looked at the address and showed it to his young companion

Same name isnt it he asked

Yes responded Mr McHulish

Do you know him asked the consul evidently surprised

We dont but hes a friend of one of the Eagle boys I reckon we would
have seen him anyhow but well agree with you to hold on until we do
Its a go Goodby old pard So long

They both shook the consuls hand and departed leaving him staring at
the fog into which they had melted as if they were unreal shadows of the
past


II


The next morning the fog had given way to a palpable horizontally
driving rain which wet the inside as well as the outside of umbrellas
and caused them to be presented at every conceivable angle as they
drifted past the windows of the consulate There was a tap at the door
and a clerk entered

Ye will be in to Sir James MacFen

The consul nodded and added Show him in here

It was the magnate to whom he had sent the note the previous day a man
of large yet slow and cautious nature learned and even pedantic yet
farsighted and practical very human and hearty in social intercourse
which however left him as it found himwith no sentimental or
unbusinesslike entanglements The consul had known him sensible and
sturdy at board meetings and executive councils logical and convincing
at political gatherings decorous and grave in the kirk and humorous
and jovial at festivities where perhaps later in the evening in
company with others hands were clasped over a libation lyrically
defined as a right guid williewaught On one of these occasions they
had walked home together not without some ostentation of steadiness
yet when MacFens eminently respectable front door had closed upon
him the consul was perfectly satisfied that a distinctly proper and
unswerving man of business would issue from it the next morning

Ay but its a soft day said Sir James removing his gloves Yell
not be gadding about in this weather

You got my note of introduction I suppose said the consul when the
momentous topic of the weather was exhausted

Oh ay

And you saw the gentlemen

Ay

And whats your opinion ofhis claims

Hes a fine ladthat Malcolma fine type of a lad said Sir
James with an almost too effusive confidence Yell be thinking so
yourselfno doubt Ay its wonderful to consider the preservation of
type so long after its dispersal in other lands And its a strange
and wonderful country that of yours with its plantationsas one might
sayof homogeneity unimpaired for so many years and keeping the old
faith tooand all its strange survivals Ay and that Kentucky
where his land isit will be a rich State Its very instructing and
interesting to hear his account of that remarkable region they call the
blue grass country and the stock they raise there Im obliged to ye
my friend for a most edifying and improving evening

But his claimdid he not speak of that

Oh ay And that Mr Custerhes a grand man and an amusing one
Yell be great comrades you and he Man it was delightful to hear him
tell of the rare doings and the bit fun ye two had in the old times
Eh sir but whod think that of the proper American consul at St
Kentigern And Sir James leaned back in his chair and bestowed an
admiring smile on that official

The consul thought he began to understand this evasion Then you dont
think much of Mr McHulishs claim he said

Im not saying that

But do you really think a claim based upon a family Bible and a family
likeness a subject for serious consideration

Im not saying THAT either laddie

Perhaps he has confided to you more fully than he has to me or
possibly you yourself knew something in corroboration of his facts

His companion had evidently no desire to be communicative But the
consul had heard enough to feel that he was justified in leaving the
matter in his hands He had given him fair warning Yet nevertheless
he would be even more explicit

I do not know he began whether this young McHulish confided to you
his great reliance upon some peculiar effect of his presence among the
tenants and of establishing his claim to the property by exciting the
enthusiasm of the clan It certainly struck me that he had some rather
exaggerated ideas borrowed perhaps from romances hed read like Don
Quixote his books of chivalry He seems to believe in the existence of a
clan loyalty and the actual survival of old feudal instincts and of old
feudal methods in the Highlands He appears to look upon himself as a
kind of local Prince Charlie and by Jove Ive an idea hes almost as
crazy

And why should he na believe in his own kith and kin said Sir James
quickly with a sudden ring in his voice and a dialectical freedom
quite distinct from his former deliberate and cautious utterance The
McHulishes were chieftains before America was discovered and manys the
time they overran the border before they went as far as that If theres
anything in blood and loyalty it would be strange if they did na
respond And I can tell ye ma frien theres more in the Hielands than
any romancer as ye call themay even Scott hissel and he was but
an Edinboro manever dreamed of Dont fash yoursel about that And
you and mell not agree about Prince Charlie Some day Ill tell ye
ma frien mair aboot that bonnie laddie than yell gather from your
partisan historians Until then yell be wise when yell be talking to
Scotchmen not to be expressing your Southern prejudices

Intensely surprised and amused at this sudden outbreak of enthusiasm on
the part of the usually cautious lawyer the consul could not refrain
from accenting it by a marked return to practical business

I shall be delighted to learn more about Prince Charlie he said
smiling but just now his prototypeif youll allow me to call him
sois a nearer topic and for the present at least until he assume his
new titles and dignities has a right to claim my protection and I
am responsible for him as an American citizen Now my dear friend is
there really any property land or title of any importance involved in
his claim and what and where in Heavens name is it For I assure you
I know nothing practical about it and cannot make head or tail of it

Sir James resumed his slow serenity and gathered up his gloves Ay
theres a great deerforest in Ballochbrinkie and theres part of
Loch Phillibeg in Cairngormshire and theres Kelpie Island off
Moreovershire Ay theres enough land when the crofters are cleared
off and the small sheeptenants evicted It will be a grand property
then

The consul stared The crofters and tenants evicted he repeated Are
they not part of the clan and loyal to the McHulish

The McHulish said Sir James with great deliberation hasnt set foot
there for years Theyd be burning him in effigy

But said the astonished consul thats rather bad for the expectant
heirand the magic of the McHulish presence

Im not saying that returned Sir James cautiously Ye see he can be
making better arrangements with the family on account of it

With the family repeated the consul Then does he talk of
compromising

I mean they would be more likely to sell for a fair consideration and
hed be better paying money to them than the lawyers The syndicate
will be rich eh And Im not saying the McHulish wouldnt take Kentucky
lands in exchange Its a fine country that blue grass district

The consul stared at Sir James so long that a faint smile came into the
latters shrewd eyes at which the consul smiled too A vague air of
relief and understanding seemed to fill the apartment

Oh ay continued Sir James drawing on his gloves with easy
deliberation hes a fine lad that Malcolm and its a praiseworthy
instinct in him to wish to return to the land of his forebears and take
his place again among them And Im noticing Mr Consul that a great
many of your countrymen are doing the same Eh yours is a gran country
of progress and ceevel and religious liberty but for a that as Burns
says its in your blood to turn to the auld home again And its a fine
thing to have the money to do itand Im thinking money well spent
all around Goodmorning Eh but Im forgetting that I wanted to ask
you to dine with me and Malcolm and your Mr Custer and Mr Watson
who will be one of your syndicate and whom I once met abroad But yell
get a bit note of invitation with the day from me later

The consul remembered that Custer had said that one of the Eagle boys
had known Sir James This was evidently Watson He smiled again but
this time Sir James responded only in a general sort of way as he
genially bowed himself out of the room

The consul watched his solid and eminently respectable figure as it
passed the window and then returned to his desk still smiling First
of all he was relieved What had seemed to him a wild and reckless
enterprise with possibly some grim international complications on the
part of his compatriots had simply resolved itself into an ordinary
business speculationthe ethics of which they had pretty equally
divided with the local operators If anything it seemed that the
Scotchman would get the best of the bargain and that for once at
least his countrymen were deficient in foresight But that was a matter
between the parties and Custer himself would probably be the first to
resent any suggestion of the kind from the consul The vision of the
McHulish burned in effigy by his devoted tenants and retainers and the
thought that the prosaic dollars of his countrymen would be substituted
for the potent presence of the heir tickled it is to be feared the
saturnine humor of the consul He had taken an invincible dislike to
the callow representative of the McHulish who he felt had in some
extraordinary way imposed upon Custers credulity But then he had
apparently imposed equally upon the practical Sir James The thought of
this sham ideal of feudal and privileged incompetency being elevated
to actual position by the combined efforts of American republicans and
hardheaded Scotch dissenters on whom the soft Scotch mists fell from
above with equal impartiality struck him as being very amusing and
for some time thereafter lightened the respectable gloom of his office
Other engagements prevented his attendance at Sir Jamess dinner
although he was informed afterward that it had passed off with great
eclat the later singing of Auld lang Syne and the drinking of the
health of Custer and Malcolm with Hieland honors He learned also that
Sir James had invited Custer and Malcolm to his lacustrine countryseat
in the early spring But he learned nothing more of the progress of
Malcolms claim its details or the manner in which it was prosecuted
No one else seemed to know anything about it it found no echo in the
gossip of the clubs or in the newspapers of St Kentigern In the
absence of the parties connected with it it began to assume to him the
aspect of a halfhumorous romance He often found himself wondering if
there had been any other purpose in this quest or speculation than what
had appeared on the surface it seemed so inadequate in result It would
have been so perfectly easy for a wealthy syndicate to buy up a much
more valuable estate He disbelieved utterly in the sincerity of
Malcolms sentimental attitude There must be some other reasonperhaps
not known even to the syndicate

One day he thought that he had found it He had received a note
addressed from one of the principal hotels but bearing a large
personal crest on paper and envelope A Miss Kirkby passing through St
Kentigern on her way to Edinburgh desired to see the consul the next
day if he would appoint an hour at the consulate or as her time was
limited she would take it as a great favor if he would call at her
hotel Although a countrywoman her name might not be so well known to
him as those of her old friends Harry Custer Esq and Sir
Malcolm McHulish The consul was a little surprised the use of the
titleunless it referred to some other McHulishwould seem to indicate
that Malcolms claim was successful He had however no previous
knowledge of the title of Sir in connection with the estate and
it was probable that his fair correspondentlike most of her
countrywomenwas more appreciative than correct in her bestowal of
dignities He determined to waive his ordinary business rules and
to call upon her at once accepting as became his patriotism that
charming tyranny which the American woman usually reserves exclusively
for her devoted countrymen

She received him with an affectation of patronage as if she had
lately become uneasily conscious of being in a country where there were
distinctions of class She was young pretty and tastefully dressed
the national feminine adaptability had not however extended to her
voice and accent Both were strongly Southwestern and as she began to
speak she seemed to lose her momentary affectation

It was mighty good of you to come and see me for the fact is I didnt
admire going to your consulatenot one bit You see Im a Southern
girl and never was reconstructed either I dont hanker after your
Govment I havent recognized it and dont want to I reckon I aint
been under the flag since the wah So you see I havent any papers to
get authenticated nor any certificates to ask for and aint wanting
any advice or protection I thought Id be fair and square with you from
the word go

Nothing could be more fascinating and infectious than the mirthful
ingenuousness which accompanied and seemed to mitigate this ungracious
speech and the consul was greatly amused albeit conscious that it was
only an attitude and perhaps somewhat worn in sentiment He knew that
during the war of the rebellion and directly after it Great Britain
was the resort of certain Americans from the West as well as from
the South who sought social distinction by the affectation of
dissatisfaction with their own government or the ostentatious simulation
of enforced exile but he was quite unprepared for this senseless
protraction of dead and gone issues He ventured to point out with
goodhumored practicality that several years had elapsed since the war
that the South and North were honorably reconciled and that he was
legally supposed to represent Kentucky as well as New York Your
friends he added smilingly Mr Custer and Mr McHulish seemed to
accept the fact without any posthumous sentiment

I dont go much on that she said with a laugh Ive been living
in Paris till mawwhos lying down upstairscame over and brought me
across to England for a look around And I reckon Malcolms got to keep
touch with you on account of his property

The consul smiled Ah then I hope you can tell me something about
THAT for I really dont know whether he has established his claim or
not

Why returned the girl with naive astonishment that was just what I
was going to ask YOU He reckoned youd know all about it

I havent heard anything of the claim for two months said the
consul but from your reference to him as Sir Malcolm I presumed you
considered it settled Though of course even then he wouldnt be Sir
Malcolm and you might have meant somebody else

Well then Lord MalcolmI cant get the hang of those titles yet

Neither Lord nor Sir you know the estate carries no title whatever
with it said the consul smilingly

But wouldnt he be the laird of something or other you know

Yes but that is only a Scotch description not a title Its not the
same as Lord

The young girl looked at him with undisguised astonishment A half laugh
twitched the corners of her mouth Are you sure she said

Perfectly returned the consul a little impatiently but do I
understand that you really know nothing more of the progress of the
claim

Miss Kirkby still abstracted by some humorous astonishment said
quickly Wait a minute Ill just run up and see if maws coming down
Shed admire to see you Then she stopped hesitated and as she rose
added Then a lairds wife wouldnt be Lady anything anyway would
she

She certainly would acquire no title merely through her marriage

The young girl laughed again nodded and disappeared The consul
amused yet somewhat perplexed over the naive brusqueness of the
interview waited patiently Presently she returned a little out of
breath but apparently still enjoying some facetious retrospect and
said Maw will be down soon After a pause fixing her bright eyes
mischievously on the consul she continued

Did you see much of Malcolm

I saw him only once

What did you think of him

The consul in so brief a period had been unable to judge

You wouldnt think I was half engaged to him would you

The consul was obliged again to protest that in so short an interview he
had been unable to conceive of Malcolms good fortune

I know what you mean said the girl lightly You think hes a crank
But its all over now the engagements off

I trust that this does not mean that you doubt his success

The lady shrugged her shoulders disdainfully Thats all right enough
I reckon Theres a hundred thousand dollars in the syndicate Maw put
in twenty thousand and Custers bound to make it goparticularly as
theres some talk of a compromise But Malcolms a crank and I reckon
if it wasnt for the compromise the syndicate wouldnt have much show
Why he didnt even know that the McHulishes had no title

Do you think he has been suffering under a delusion in regard to his
relationship

No he was only a fool in the way he wanted to prove it He actually
got these boys to think it could be filibustered into his possession
Had a sort of idea of a rising in the Highlands you know like that
poem or picturewhich is it And those fool boys and Custer among
them thought it would be great fun and a great spree Luckily maw had
the gumption to get Watson to write over about it to one of his friends
a MrMrMacFen a very prominent man

Perhaps you mean Sir James MacFen suggested the consul Hes a
knight And what did HE say he added eagerly

Oh he wrote a most sensible letter returned the lady apparently
mollified by the title of Watsons adviser saying that there was
little doubt if any that if the American McHulishes wanted the old
estate they could get it by the expenditure of a little capital He
offered to make the trial that was the compromise theyre talking
about But he didnt say anything about there being no Lord McHulish

Perhaps he thought as you were Americans you didnt care for THAT
said the consul dryly

Thats no reason why we shouldnt have it if it belonged to us or we
chose to pay for it said the lady pertly

Then your changed personal relations with Mr McHulish is the reason
why you hear so little of his progress or his expectations

Yes but he dont know that they are changed for we havent seen him
since weve been here although they say hes here and hiding somewhere
about

Why should he be hiding

The young girl lifted her pretty brows Maybe he thinks its
mysterious Didnt I tell you he was a crank Yet she laughed so
naively and with such sublime unconsciousness of any reflection on
herself that the consul was obliged to smile too

You certainly do not seem to be breaking your heart as well as your
engagement he said

Not muchbut here comes maw Look here she said turning suddenly
and coaxingly upon him if she asks you to come along with us up north
youll come wont you Do It will be such fun

Up north repeated the consul interrogatively

Yes to see the property Heres maw

A more languid but equally wellappointed woman had entered the room
When the ceremony of introduction was over she turned to her daughter
and said Run away dear while I talk business witherthis
gentleman and as the girl withdrew laughingly she half stifled a
reminiscent yawn and raised her heavy lids to the consul

Youve had a talk with my Elsie

The consul confessed to having had that pleasure

She speaks her mind said Mrs Kirkby wearily but she means well
and for all her flightiness her heads level And since her father died
she runs me she continued with a slight laugh After a pause she
added abstractedly I suppose she told you of her engagement to young
McHulish

Yes but she said she had broken it

Mrs Kirkby lifted her eyebrows with an expression of relief It was a
piece of girl and boy foolishness anyway she said Elsie and he were
children together at MacCorklevillesecond cousins in factand I
reckon he got her fancy excited over his nobility and his being the
chief of the McHulishes Of course Custer will manage to get something
for the shareholders out of itI never knew him to fail in a money
speculation yetbut I think thats about all I had an idea of going
up with Elsie to take a look at the property and I thought of asking
you to join us Did Elsie tell you I know shed like itand so would
I

For all her indolent purposeless manner there was enough latent
sincerity and earnestness in her request to interest the consul
Besides his own curiosity in regard to this singularly supported claim
was excited and here seemed to be an opportunity of satisfying it He
was not quite sure either that his previous antagonism to his fair
countrywomans apparent selfishness and snobbery was entirely just He
had been absent from America a long time perhaps it was he himself
who had changed and lost touch with his compatriots And yet the
demonstrative independence and recklessness of men like Custer were less
objectionable to and less inconsistent with his American ideas than
the snobbishness and almost servile adaptability of the women Or was
it possible that it was only a weakness of the sex which no republican
nativity or education could eliminate Nevertheless he looked up
smilingly

But the property is I understand scattered about in various places
he said

Oh but we mean to go only to Kelpie Island where there is the ruin of
an old castle Elsie must see that

The consul thought it might be amusing By all means let us see that I
shall be delighted to go with you

His ready and unqualified assent appeared to relieve and dissipate the
ladys abstraction She became more natural and confiding spoke freely
of Malcolms mania which she seemed to accept as a hallucination or a
conviction with equal cheerfulness and in brief convinced the
consul that her connection with the scheme was only the caprice of
inexperienced and unaccustomed idleness He left her promising to
return the next day and arrange for their early departure

His way home lay through one of the public squares of St Kentigern at
an hour of the afternoon when it was crossed by working men and women
returning to their quarters from the docks and factories Never in any
light a picturesque or even cheery procession there were days when
its unwholesome monotonous poverty and dull hopelessness of prospect
impressed him more forcibly He remembered how at first the spectacle
of barefooted girls and women slipping through fog and mist across the
greasy pavement had offended his fresh New World conception of a more
tenderly nurtured sex until his susceptibilities seemed to have grown
as callous and hardened as the flesh he looked upon and he had begun to
regard them from the easy local standpoint of a distinct and differently
equipped class

It chanced also that this afternoon some of the male workers had added
to their usual solidity a singular trancelike intoxication It had
often struck him before as a form of drunkenness peculiar to the St
Kentigern laborers Men passed him singly and silently as if following
some vague alcoholic dream or moving through some Scotch mist of
whiskey and water Others clung unsteadily but as silently together
with no trace of convivial fellowship or hilarity in their dull fixed
features and mechanically moving limbs There was something weird in
this mirthless companionship and the appalling loneliness of those
fixed or abstracted eyes Suddenly he was aware of two men who were
reeling toward him under the influence of this druglike intoxication
and he was startled by a likeness which one of them bore to some one
he had seen but where and under what circumstances he could not
determine The fatuous eye the features of complacent vanity and
selfsatisfied reverie were there either intensified by drink or
perhaps suggesting it through some other equally hopeless form of
hallucination He turned and followed the man trying to identify
him through his companion who appeared to be a petty tradesman of a
shrewder more material type But in vain and as the pair turned into
a side street the consul slowly retraced his steps But he had not
proceeded far before the recollection that had escaped him returned and
he knew that the likeness suggested by the face he had seen was that of
Malcolm McHulish


III


A journey to Kelpie Island consisted of a series of consecutive episodes
by rail by coach and by steamboat The consul was already familiar
with them as indeed were most of the civilized world for it seemed
that all roads at certain seasons led out of and returned to St
Kentigern as a point in a vast circle wherein travelers were sure
to meet one another again coming or going at certain depots and
caravansaries with more or less superiority or envy Tourists on the
road to the historic crags of Wateffa came sharply upon other tourists
returning from them and glared suspiciously at them as if to wrest the
dread secret from their soulsa scrutiny which the others returned with
halfhumorous pity or superior calm

The consul knew also that the service by boat and rail was admirable
and skillful for were not the righteous St Kentigerners of the tribe
of Tubalcain great artificers in steel and iron and a mighty race
of engineers before the Lord who had carried their calling and accent
beyond the seas He knew too that the land of these delightful
caravansaries overflowed with marmalade and honey and that the manna
of delicious scones and cakes fell even upon deserted waters of crag
and heather He knew that their way would lie through much scenery
whose rude barrenness and grim economy of vegetation had been usually
accepted by cockney tourists for sublimity and grandeur but he knew
also that its severity was mitigated by lowland glimpses of sylvan
luxuriance and tangled delicacy utterly unlike the complacent snugness
of an English pastoral landscape with which it was often confounded and
misunderstood as being tame and civilized

It rained the day they left St Kentigern and the next and the day
after that spasmodically as regarded local effort sporadically as
seen through the filmed windows of railway carriages or from the shining
decks of steamboats There was always a shower being sown somewhere
along the valley or reluctantly tearing itself from a mountaintop
or being pulled into long threads from the leaden bosom of a lake the
coach swept in and out of them to the folding and unfolding of umbrellas
and mackintoshes accompanied by flying beams of sunlight that raced
with the vehicle on long hillsides and vanished at the turn of the
road There were hatlifting scurries of wind down the mountainside
small tumults in little lakes below hysteric ebullitions on mild
melancholy inland seas boisterous passages of nearly half an hour with
landings on tempestuous miniature quays All this seen through wonderful
aqueous vapor against a background of sky darkened at times to the
depths of an India ink washed sketch but more usually blurred
and confused on the surface like the gray silhouette of a childs
slatepencil drawing half rubbed from the slate by soft palms
Occasionally a rare glinting of real sunshine on a distant fringe of
dripping larches made some frowning crest appear to smile as through wet
lashes

Miss Elsie tucked her little feet under the mackintosh I know she
said sadly I should get webfooted if I stayed here long Why its
like coming down from Ararat just after the deluge cleared up

Mrs Kirkby suggested that if the sun would only shine squarely and
decently like a Christian for a few moments they could see the
prospect better

The consul here pointed out that the admirers of Scotch scenery thought
that this was its greatest charm It was this misty effect which made it
so superior to what they called the vulgar chromos and sunpictures of
less favored lands

You mean because it prevents folks from seeing how poor the view really
is

The consul remarked that perhaps distance was lacking As to the sun
shining in a Christian way this might depend upon the local idea of
Christianity

Well I dont call the scenery giddy or frivolous certainly And I
reckon I begin to understand the kind of sermons Malcolms folks brought
over to MacCorkleville I guess they didnt know much of the heaven
they only saw once a year Why even the highest hillswhich they call
mountains hereaint big enough to get above the fogs of their own
creating

Feminine wit is not apt to be abstract It struck the consul that in
Miss Elsies sprightliness there was the usual ulterior and personal
object and he glanced around at his fellowpassengers The object
evidently was sitting at the end of the opposite seat an amused but
wellbehaved listener For the rest he was still young and reserved
but in face figure and dress utterly unlike his companionsan
Englishman of a pronounced and distinct type the man of society and
clubs While there was more or less hinting of local influence in the
apparel of the othersthere was a kilt and bare unweatherbeaten
knees from Birmingham and even the American Elsie wore a bewitching
tamoshanterthe stranger carried easy distinction from his tweed
travelingcap to his wellmade shoes and gaiters as an unmistakable
Southerner His deep and pleasantly level voice had been heard only once
or twice and then only in answering questions and his quiet composed
eyes alone had responded to the young girls provocation

They were passing a brown glen in the cheerless depths of which a brown
watercourse a shade lighter was running and occasionally foaming
like brown beer Beyond it heaved an arid bulk of hillside the scant
vegetation of which scattered like patches of hair made it look like
the decaying hide of some huge antediluvian ruminant On the dreariest
part of the dreary slope rose the ruins of a tower and crumbling walls
and battlements

Whatever possessed folks to build there said Miss Elsie If they
were poor it might be some excuse but that those old swells or
chiefs should put up a castle in such a Godforsaken place gets ME

But dont you know they WERE poor according to our modern ideas and
I fancy they built these things more for defense than show and really
more to gather in cattlelike one of your Texan ranchesafter a raid
That is I have heard so I rather fancy that was the idea wasnt it
It was the Englishman who had spoken and was now looking around at the
other passengers as if in easy deference to local opinion

What raid said Miss Elsie animatedly Oh yes I seeone of their
old border raidsmosstroopers I used to like to read about them

I fancy dont you know said the Englishman slowly that it wasnt
exactly THAT sort of thing you know for its a good way from the
border but it was one of their raids upon their neighbors to lift
their cattlesteal em in fact Thats the way those chaps had But
of course youve read all about that You Americans dont you know are
all up in these historical matters

Eh but they were often reprisals said a Scotch passenger

I dont suppose they took much trouble to inquire if the beasts
belonged to an enemy said the Englishman

But here Miss Elsie spoke of castles generally and averred that the
dearest wish of her life was to see Macbeths castle at Glamis where
Duncan was murdered At which the Englishman still deferentially
mistrusted the fact that the murder had been committed there and
thought that the castle to which Shakespeare probably referred if he
hadnt invented the murder too was farther north at Cawdor You
know he added playfully over there in America youve discovered that
Shakespeare himself was an invention

This led to some retaliating brilliancy from the young lady and when
the coach stopped at the next station their conversation had presumably
become interesting enough to justify him in securing a seat nearer to
her The talk returning to ruins Miss Elsie informed him that they were
going to see some on Kelpie Island The consul from some instinctive
impulseperhaps a recollection of Custers peculiar methods gave her
a sign of warning But the Englishman only lifted his eyebrows in a kind
of halfhumorous concern

I dont think youd like it you know Its a beastly placerocks
and seaworse than this and half the time you cant see the mainland
only a mile away Really you know they oughtnt to have induced you to
take tickets therethose excursionticket chaps Theyre jolly frauds
Its no place for a stranger to go to

But there are the ruins of an old castle the old seat ofbegan the
astonished Miss Elsie but she was again stopped by a significant glance
from the consul

I believe there was something of the kind there oncesomething
like your friends the cattlestealers castle over on that hillside
returned the Englishman but the stones were taken by the fishermen for
their cabins and the walls were quite pulled down

How dared they do that said the young lady indignantly I call it
not only sacrilege but stealing

It was defrauding the owner of the property they might as well take
his money said Mrs Kirkby in languid protest

The smile which this outburst of proprietorial indignation brought to
the face of the consul lingered with the Englishmans reply

But it was only robbing the old robbers dont you know and they put
their spoils to better use than their old masters did certainly to
more practical use than the owners do now for the ruins are good for
nothing

But the hallowed associationsthe picturesqueness continued Mrs
Kirkby with languid interest

The associations wouldnt be anything except to the family you know
and I should fancy they wouldnt be either hallowed or pleasant As for
picturesqueness the ruins are beastly ugly weatherbeaten instead of
being mellowed by time you know and bare where they ought to be hidden
by vines and moss I cant make out why anybody sent you there for you
Americans are rather particular about your sightseeing

We heard of them through a friend said the consul with assumed
carelessness Perhaps its as good an excuse as any for a pleasant
journey

And very likely your friend mistook it for something else or was
himself imposed upon said the Englishman politely But you might not
think it so and after all he added thoughtfully its years since
Ive seen it I only meant that I could show you something better a
few miles from my place in Gloucestershire and not quite so far from
a railway as this If he added with a pleasant deliberation which
was the real courtesy of his conventionally worded speech you ever
happened at any time to be anywhere near Audrey Edge and would look me
up I should be glad to show it to you and your friends An hour later
when he left them at a railway station where their paths diverged Miss
Elsie recovered a fluency that she had lately checked Well I like
that He never told us his name or offered a card I wonder if they
call that an invitation over here Does he suppose anybodys going to
look up his old Audrey Edgeperhaps its named after his wifeto find
out who HE is He might have been civil enough to have left his name if
hemeant anything

But I assure you he was perfectly sincere and meant an invitation
returned the consul smilingly Audrey Edge is evidently a wellknown
place and he a man of some position That is why he didnt specify
either

Well you wont catch me going there said Miss Elsie

You would be quite right in either going or staying away said the
consul simply

Miss Elsie tossed her head slightly Nevertheless before they left the
station she informed him that she had been told that the stationmaster
had addressed the stranger as my lord and that another passenger had
said he was Lord Duncaster

And that proves

That Im right said the young lady decisively and that his
invitation was a mere form

It was after sundown when they reached the picturesque and
wellappointed hotel that lifted itself above the little fishingvillage
which fronted Kelpie Island The hotel was in as strong contrast to the
narrow curving street of dull comfortlesslooking stone cottages below
it as were the smart tourists who had just landed from the steamer to
the hardvisaged roughly clad villagers who watched them with a certain
mingling of critical independence and superior selfrighteousness
As the new arrivals walked down the main street half beach half
thoroughfare their baggage following them in low trolleys drawn by
porters at their heels like a decorous funeral the joyless faces of
the lookerson added to the resemblance Beyond them in the prolonged
northern twilight the waters of the bay took on a peculiar pewtery
brightness but with the usual mourningedged border of Scotch seacoast
scenery Low banks of cloud lay on the chill sea the outlines of Kelpie
Island were hidden

But the interior of the hotel bright with the latest fastidiousness in
modern decoration and artfurniture and gay with pictured canvases and
color seemed to mock the sullen landscape and the sterile crags amid
which the building was set An attempt to make a pleasance in this
barren waste had resulted only in empty vases bleak statuary and
iron settees as cold and slippery to the touch as the sides of their
steamer

Itll be a fine morning tomorra and therll be a boat going away to
Kelpie for a peekneek in the ruins said the porter as the consul and
his fair companions looked doubtfully from the windows of the cheerful
hall

A picnic in the sacred ruins of Kelpie The consul saw the ladies
stiffening with indignation at this trespass upon their possible rights
and probable privileges and glanced at them warningly

Do you mean to say that it is common property and ANYBODY can go
there demanded Miss Elsie scornfully

No its only the hotel that owns the boat and gives the ticketsa
halfcrown the passage

And do the owners the McHulishes permit this

The porter looked at them with a puzzled halfpitying politeness He
was a handsome tall broadshouldered young fellow with a certain
naive and gentle courtesy of manner that relieved his strong accent
Oh ay he said with a reassuring smile yell no be troubled by
THEM Ill just gang away noo and see if I can secure the teekets

An elderly guest who was examining a timetable on the wall turned to
them as the porter disappeared

Yell be strangers noo and not knowing that Tonalt the porter is a
McHulish hissel he said deliberately

A what said the astonished Miss Elsie

A McHulish Ay one of the family The McHulishes of Kelpie were his
own forebears Eh but hes a fine lad and doin well for the hotel

Miss Elsie extinguished a sudden smile with her handkerchief as her
mother anxiously inquired And are the family as poor as that

But I am not saying hes POOR maam no replied the stranger with
native caution What wi tips and gratooities and percentages on the
teekets its a bit of money hell be having in the bank noo

The prophecy of Donald McHulish as to the weather came true The next
morning was bright and sunny and the boat to Kelpie Islanda large
yawlduly received its complement of passengers and provision
hampers The ladies had apparently become more tolerant of their fellow
pleasureseekers and it appeared that Miss Elsie had even overcome her
hilarity at the discovery of what might have been a relative in
the person of the porter Donald I had a long talk with him before
breakfast this morning she said gayly and I know all about him It
appears that there are hundreds of himall McHulishesall along the
coast and elsewhereonly none of them ever lived ON the island
and dont want to But he looks more like a laird and a chief than
Malcolm and if it comes to choosing a head of the family remember
maw I shall vote solid for him

How can you go on so Elsie said Mrs Kirkby with languid protest
Only I trust you didnt say anything to him of the syndicate And
thank Heaven the property isnt here

No the waiter tells me all the lovely things we had for breakfast came
from miles away And they dont seem to have ever raised anything on
the island from its looks Think of having to row three miles for the
mornings milk

There was certainly very little appearance of vegetation on the sterile
crags that soon began to lift themselves above the steely waves ahead
A few scraggy trees and bushes which twisted and writhed like vines
around the square tower and crumbling walls of an irregular but angular
building looked in their brown shadows like part of the debris

Its just like a burntdown boneboiling factory said Miss Elsie
critically and I shouldnt wonder if that really was old McHulishs
business They couldnt have it on the mainland for its being a
nuisance

Nevertheless she was one of the first to leap ashore when the yawls
bow grated in a pebbly cove and carried her pretty but incongruous
little slippers through the seaweed wet sand and slimy cobbles with a
heroism that redeemed her vanity A scrambling ascent of a few moments
brought them to a wall with a gap in it which gave easy ingress to
the interior of the ruins This was merely a little curving hollow from
which the outlines of the plan had long since faded It was kept green
by the brown walls which like the crags of the mainland valleys
sheltered it from the incessant strife of the Atlantic gales A few
pale flowers that might have grown in a damp cellar shivered against
the stones Scraps of newspapers sodawater and beer bottles highly
decorated old provision tins and spent cartridge casesthe remains
of chilly picnics and damp shooting luncheonshad at first sight lent
color to the foreground by mere contrast but the corrosion of time
and weather had blackened rather than mellowed the walls in a way which
forcibly reminded the consul of Miss Elsies simile of the burntdown
factory The view from the square towera mere roost for unclean
seafowl from the sides of which rags of peeling moss and vine hung
like tattered clothingwas equally depressing The few fishermens huts
along the shore were built of stones taken from the ruin and roofed in
with sodden beams and timbers in the last stages of deliquescence The
thick smoke of smouldering peatfires came from the low chimneys and
drifted across the ruins with the odors of drying fish

Ive just seen a sort of groundplan of the castle said Miss Elsie
cheerfully It never had a room in it as big as our bedroom in the
hotel and there werent windows enough to go round A slit in the
wall about two inches wide by two feet long was considered dazzling
extravagance to Malcolms ancestors I dont wonder some of em broke
out and swam over to America That reminds me Who do you suppose is
herecame over from the hotel in a boat of his own just to see maw

Not Malcolm surely

Not much replied Miss Elsie setting her small lips together Its
Mr Custer Hes talking business with her now down on the beach
Theyll be here when lunch is ready

The consul remembered the romantic plan which the enthusiastic Custer
had imparted to him in the foggy consulate at St Kentigern and then
thought of the matter of fact tourists the few stolid fishermen and
the prosaic ruins around them and smiled He looked up and saw that
Miss Elsie was watching him

You know Mr Custer dont you

We are old Californian friends

I thought so but I think he looked a little upset when he heard you
were here too

He certainly was a little awkward as if struggling with some
halfhumorous embarrassment as he came forward a few moments later with
Mrs Kirkby But the stimulation of the keen sea air triumphed over the
infelicities of the situation and surroundings and the little party
were presently enjoying their wellselected luncheon with the wholesome
appetite of travel and change The chill damp made limp the napkins
and tablecloth and invaded the victuals the wind which was rising
whistled round the walls and made miniature cyclones of the torn paper
and dried twigs around them but they ate drank and were merry At the
end of the repast the two gentlemen rose to light their cigars in the
lee of the wall

I suppose you know all about Malcolm said Custer after an awkward
pause

My dear fellow said the consul somewhat impatiently I know nothing
about him and you ought to know that by this time

I thought YOUR FRIEND Sir James might have told you continued
Custer with significant emphasis

I have not seen Sir James for two months

Well Malcolms a crankalways was one I reckon and is reglarly
off his head now Yes sir Scotch whiskey and your friend Sir James
finished him After that dinner at MacFens he was done forwent wild
Danced a sworddance or a strathspey or some other blamed thing on
the table and yelled louder than the pipes So they all did Jack Ive
painted the town red once myself I thought I knew what a firstclass
jamboree was but they were prayermeetings to that show Everybody was
blind drunkbut they all got over it except HIM THEY were a different
lot of men the next day as cool and cautious as you please but HE was
shut up for a week and came out crazy

But whats that to do with his claim

Well there aint much use whooping up the boys when only the whooper
gets wild

Still that does not affect any right he may have in the property

But it affects the syndicate said Custer gloomily and when we found
that he was whooping up some shopkeepers and factory hands who claimed
to belong to the clanand you cant heave a stone at a dog around here
without hitting a McHulishwe concluded we hadnt much use for him
ornamentally So we shipped him home last steamer

And the property

Oh thats all right said Custer still gloomily Weve effected an
amicable compromise as Sir James calls it That means weve taken a lot
of land somewhere north that you can shoot overthat is you neednt
be afraid of hitting a house or a tree or a man anywhere and weve
got a strip more of the same sort on the seashore somewhere off here
occupied only by some gay galoots called crofters and you can raise
a lawsuit and an imprecation on every acre Then theres this
soulsubduing sequestered spot and whats left of the old boneboiling
establishment and the rights of fishing and peatburning and otherwise
creating a nuisance off the mainland It cost the syndicate only a
hundred thousand dollars half cash and half in Texan and Kentucky grass
lands But weve carried the thing through

I congratulate you said the consul

Thanks Custer puffed at his cigar for a few moments That Sir James
MacFen is a fine man

He is

A large broad allround man Knows everything and everybody dont
he

I think so

Big man in the church I should say No slouch at a party canvass or
ward politics eh As a board director or president just takes the
cake dont he

I believe so

Nothing mean about Jimmy as an advocate or an arbitrator either is
there Rings the bell every time dont he Financiers take a back seat
when hes around Owns half of Scotland by this time I reckon

The consul believed that Sir James had the reputation of being
exceedingly sagacious in financial and mercantile matters and that he
was a man of some wealth

Naturally I wonder what hed take to come over to America and give
the boys points continued Custer in meditative admiration There
were two or three men on Scotts River and one Chinaman that we used
to think smart but they were doddering ijuts to HIM And as for meI
say Jack you didnt see any hayseed in my hair that day I walked inter
your consulate did you

The consul smilingly admitted that he had not noticed these signs of
rustic innocence in his friend

Nor any flies Well for all that when I get home Im going to resign
No more foreign investments for ME When anybody calls at the consulate
and asks for H J Custer say you dont know me And you dont And I
say Jack try to smooth things over for me with HER

With Miss Elsie

Custer cast a glance of profound pity upon the consul No with Mrs
Kirkby of course See

The consul thought he did see and that he had at last found a clue to
Custers extraordinary speculation But like most theorists who
argue from a single fact a few months later he might have doubted his
deduction

He was staying at a large countryhouse many miles distant from the
scene of his late experiences Already they had faded from his memory
with the departure of his compatriots from St Kentigern He was smoking
by the fire in the billiardroom late one night when a fellowguest
approached him

Saw you didnt remember me at dinner

The voice was hesitating pleasant and not quite unfamiliar The
consul looked up and identified the figure before him as one of the new
arrivals that day whom in the informal and easy courtesy of the
house he had met with no further introduction than a vague smile He
remembered too that the stranger had glanced at him once or twice at
dinner with shy but engaging reserve

You must see such a lot of people and the way things are arranged
and settled here everybody expects to look and act like everybody
else dont you know so you cant tell one chap from another Deuced
annoying eh Thats where you Americans are different and thats
why those countrywomen of yours were so charming dont you know so
original We were all together on the top of a coach in Scotland dont
you remember Had such a jolly time in the beastly rain You didnt
catch my name Its Duncaster

The consul at once recalled his former fellowtraveler The two men
shook hands The Englishman took a pipe from his smokingjacket and
drew a chair beside the consul

Yes he continued comfortably filling his pipe the daughter
Miss Kirkby was awfully good fun so fresh so perfectly natural and
innocent dont you know and yet so extraordinarily sharp and clever
She had some awfully good chaff over that Scotch scenery before those
Scotch tourists do you remember And it was all so beastly true too
Perhaps shes with you here

There was so much unexpected and unaffected interest in the young
Englishmans eyes that the consul was quite serious in his regrets that
the ladies had gone back to Paris

Id like to have taken them over to Audrey Edge from here Its no
distance by train I did ask them in Scotland but I suppose they had
something better to do But you might tell them Ive got some sisters
there and that it is an old place and not half bad dont you know
when you write to them You might give me their address

The consul did so and added a few pleasant words regarding their
positionbarring the syndicatewhich he had gathered from Custer
Lord Duncasters look of interest far from abating became gently
confidential

I suppose you must see a good deal of your countrymen in your business
and I suppose just like Englishmen they differ by Jove Some of them
dont you know are rather pushing and anxious for position and all
that sort of thing and some of em like your friends are quite
independent and natural

He stopped and puffed slowly at his pipe Presently he took it from
his mouth with a little laugh Ive a mind to tell you a rather queer
experience of mine Its nothing against your people generally you
know nor do I fancy its even an American type so you wont mind my
speaking of it Ive got some property in Scotlandrather poor stuff
youd call itbut by Jove some Americans have been laying claim
to it under some obscure plea of relationship There might have been
something in it although not all they claim but my business man a
clever chap up in your placeperhaps you may have heard of him
Sir James MacFenwrote to me that what they really wanted were some
ancestral lands with the right to use the family name and privileges
The oddest part of the affair was that the claimant was an impossible
sort of lunatic and the whole thing was run by a syndicate of shrewd
Western men As I dont care for the property which has only been
dropping a lot of money every year for upkeep and litigation Sir James
who is an awfully farsighted chap at managing thought he could effect
a compromise and get rid of the property at a fair valuation And
by Jove he did But what your countrymen can get out of itfor
the shooting isnt half as good as what they can get in their own
countryor what use the privileges are to them I cant fancy

I think I know the story said the consul eying his fellowguest
attentively but if I remember rightly the young man claimed to be the
rightful and only surviving heir

The Englishman rose and bending over the hearth slowly knocked the
ashes from his pipe Thats quite impossible dont you know For he
added as he stood up in front of the fire in face figure and careless
repose more decidedly English than ever you see my title of Duncaster
only came to me through an uncle but I am the direct and sole heir of
the old family and the Scotch property I dont perhaps look like a
Scotweve been settled in England some timebut he continued
with an invincible English drawling deliberation

Iamreallyyouknowwhat they call The McHulish




AN EPISODE OF WEST WOODLANDS


I


The rain was dripping monotonously from the scant eaves of the little
church of the Sidon Brethren at West Woodlands Hewn out of the very
heart of a thicket of buckeye spruce and alder unsunned and unblown
upon by any wind it was so green and unseasoned in its solitude that it
seemed a part of the arboreal growth and on damp Sundays to have
taken root again and sprouted There were moss and shining spots on the
underside of the unplaned rafters little green pools of infusoria stood
on the ledge of the windows whose panes were at times suddenly clouded
by mysterious unknown breaths from without or within It was oppressed
with an extravagance of leaves at all seasons whether in summer when
green and limp they crowded the porch doorways and shutters or when
penetrating knotholes and interstices of shingle and clapboard on some
creeping vine they unexpectedly burst and bourgeoned on the walls like
banners or later when they rotted in brown heaps in corners outlined
the edges of the floor with a thin yellow border or invaded the ranks
of the highbacked benches which served as pews

There had been a continuous rustling at the porch and the shaking out
of waterproofs and closing of umbrellas until the halffilled church was
already redolent of damp dyes and the sulphur of India rubber The eyes
of the congregation were turned to the door with something more than the
usual curiosity and expectation For the new revivalist preacher from
Horse Shoe Bay was coming that morning Already voices of authority were
heard approaching and keeping up their conversation to the very door
of the sacred edifice in marked contrast with the awed and bashful
whisperings in the porch of the ordinary congregation The worshipers
recognized the voices of Deacons Shadwell and Bradley in the
reverential hush of the building they seemed charged with undue
importance

It was set back in the road for quiet in the Lords work said
Bradley

Yes but it oughtnt be hidden Let your light so shine before men
you know Brother Bradley returned a deep voice unrecognized and
unfamiliarpresumably that of the newcomer

It wouldnt take much to move iton skids and rollersnearer to the
road suggested Shadwell tentatively

No but if you left it stranded there in the wind and sun green and
sappy as it is now yed have every seam and crack startin till the
ribs shone through and no amount of calkin would make it watertight
agin No my idea isclear out the brush and shadder around it Let the
light shine in upon it Make the waste places glad around it but keep
it THERE And thats my idea o genral missionary work thats how the
gospel orter be rooted

Here the bell which from the plain open fourposted belfry above
had been clanging with a metallic sharpness that had an odd impatient
worldliness about it suddenly ceased

That bell said Bradleys voice with the same suggestion of conveying
important truths to the listening congregation within was took from
the wreck of the Tamalpais Brother Horley bought it at auction at
Horse Shoe Bay and presented it You know the Tamalpais ran ashore on
Skinners Reef jest off here

Yes with plenty of sea room not half a gale o wind blowing and her
real course fifty miles to westward The whole watch must have drunk or
sunk in slothful idleness returned the deep voice again A momentary
pause followed and then the two deacons entered the church with the
stranger

He appeared to be a powerfullybuilt man with a square beardless chin
a face that carried one or two scars of smallpox and a deeper one of
a less peaceful suggestion set in a complexion weatherbeaten to the
color of Spanish leather Two small moist gray eyes that glistened
with every emotion seemed to contradict the hard expression of the
other features He was dressed in cheap black like the two deacons
with the exception of a loose black alpaca coat and the usual black
silk neckerchief tied in a large bow under a turndown collarthe
general sign and symbol of a minister of his sect He walked directly
to the raised platform at the end of the chapel where stood a table on
which was a pitcher of water a glass and hymnbook and a tall upright
desk holding a Bible Glancing over these details he suddenly paused
carefully lifted some hitherto undetected object from the desk beside
the Bible and stooping gently placed it upon the floor As it hopped
away the congregation saw that it was a small green frog The intrusion
was by no means an unusual one but some odd contrast between this
powerful man and the little animal affected them profoundly No
oneeven the youngestsmiled every oneeven the youngestbecame
suddenly attentive Turning over the leaves of the hymnbook he then
gave out the first two lines of a hymn The choir accordion in the front
side bench awoke like an infant into wailing life and Cissy Appleby
soprano took up a little more musically the lugubrious chant At the
close of the verse the preacher joined in after a sailor fashion with
a breezy bass that seemed to fill the little building with the trouble
of the sea Then followed prayer from Deacon Shadwell broken by Amens
from the preacher with a nautical suggestion of Ay ay about them
and he began his sermon

It was as those who knew his methods might have expected a suggestion
of the conversation they had already overheard He likened the little
chapel choked with umbrage and rotting in its dampness to the gospel
seed sown in crowded places famishing in the midst of plenty and
sterile from the absorptions of the more active life around it He
pointed out again the true work of the pioneer missionary the
careful pruning and elimination of those forces that grew up with the
Christians life which many people foolishly believed were a part of
it The WORLD must live and the WORD must live said they and there
were easygoing brethren who thought they could live together But he
warned them that the World was always closing uponshadderingand
strangling the Word unless kept down and that fair seemin
settlement or city which appeared to be bustin and bloomin with
life and progress was really hustlin and jostlin the Word of God
even in the midst of these fancy spires and steeples it had erected
to its glory It was the work of the missionary pioneer to keep down or
root out this carnal worldly growth as much in the settlement as in the
wilderness Some were for getting over the difficulty by dragging the
mere wasted letter of the Word or the rotten and withered husks of
it into the highways and byways where the blazin scorn of the World
would finish it A low penitential groan from Deacon Shadwell followed
this accusing illustration But the preacher would tell them that the
only way was to boldly attack this rankly growing World around them
to clear out fresh paths for the Truth and let the sunlight of Heaven
stream among them

There was little doubt that the congregation was moved Whatever they
might have thought of the application the fact itself was patent The
rheumatic Beaseleys felt the truth of it in their aching bones it came
home to the fever and ague stricken Filgees in their damp seats against
the sappy wall it echoed plainly in the chronic cough of Sister Mary
Strutt and Widow Doddridge and Cissy Appleby with her round brown eyes
fixed upon the speaker remembering how the starch had been taken out of
her Sunday frocks how her long ringlets had become uncurled her frills
limp and even her ribbons lustreless felt that indeed a prophet had
arisen in Israel

One or two however were disappointed that he had as yet given no
indication of that powerful exhortatory emotion for which he was famed
and which had been said to excite certain corresponding corybantic
symptoms among his sensitive female worshipers When the service was
over and the congregation crowded around him Sister Mary Strutt on
the outer fringe of the assembly confided to Sister Evans that she had
hearn tell how that when he was over at Soquel he prayed that powful
that all the wimmen got fits and tremblin spells and ole Mrs Jackson
had to be hauled off his legs that she was kneelin and claspin while
wrestling with the Sperit

I reckon we seemed kinder strange to him this morning and he wanted to
jest feel his way to our hearts first exclaimed Brother Jonas Steers
politely Hell be more at home at evenin service Its queer that
some of the best exhortin work is done arter early candlelight I
reckon hes goin to stop over with Deacon Bradley to dinner

But it appeared that the new preacher now formally introduced as
Brother Seabright was intending to walk over to Hemlock Mills to
dinner He only asked to be directed the nearest way he would not
trouble Brother Shadwell or Deacon Bradley to come with him

But heres Cissy Appleby lives within a mile o thar and you could
go along with her Shed jest admire to show you the way interrupted
Brother Shadwell Wouldnt you Cissy

Thus appealed to the young choristera tall girl of sixteen or
seventeentimidly raised her eyes to Brother Seabright as he was about
to repeat his former protestation and he stopped

Ef the young lady IS goin that way its only fair to accept her
kindness in a Christian sperit he said gently

Cissy turned with a mingling of apology and bashfulness towards a young
fellow who seemed to be acting as her escort but who was hesitating
in an equal bashfulness when Seabright added And perhaps our young
friend will come too

But the young friend drew back with a confused laugh and Brother
Seabright and Cissy passed out from the porch together For a few
moments they mingled with the stream and conversation of the departing
congregation but presently Cissy timidly indicated a diverging bypath
and they both turned into it

It was much warmer in the open than it had been in the chapel and
thicket and Cissy by way of relieving a certain awkward tension of
silence took off the waterproof cloak and slung it on her arm This
disclosed her five long brown cablelike curls that hung down her
shoulders reaching below her waist in some forgotten fashion of
girlhood They were Cissys peculiar adornment remarkable for their
length thickness and the extraordinary youthfulness imparted to a
figure otherwise precociously matured In some wavering doubt of her
actual years and privileges Brother Seabright offered to carry
her cloak for her but she declined it with a rustic and youthful
pertinacity that seemed to settle the question In fact Cissy was
as much embarrassed as she was flattered by the company of this
distinguished stranger However it would be known to all West Woodland
that he had walked home with her while nobody but herself would know
that they had scarcely exchanged a word She noticed how he lounged on
with a heavy rolling gait sometimes a little before or behind her as
the path narrowed At such times when they accidentally came in contact
in passing she felt a half uneasy physical consciousness of him which
she referred to his size the scars on his face or some latent hardness
of expression but was relieved to see that he had not observed it
Yet this was the man that made grown women cry she thought of old
Mrs Jackson fervently grasping the plodding ankles before her and
a hysteric desire to laugh with the fear that he might see it on her
face overcame her Then she wondered if he was going to walk all the
way home without speaking yet she knew she would be more embarrassed if
he began to talk to her

Suddenly he stopped and she bumped up against him

Oh excuse me she stammered hurriedly

Eh He evidently had not noticed the collision Did you speak

Nothat isit wasnt anything returned the girl coloring

But he had quite forgotten her and was looking intently before him
They had come to a break in the fringe of woodland and upon a sudden
view of the ocean At this point the low line of coastrange which
sheltered the valley of West Woodlands was abruptly cloven by a gorge
that crumbled and fell away seaward to the shore of Horse Shoe Bay
On its northern trend stretched the settlement of Horse Shoe to the
promontory of Whale Mouth Point with its outlying reef of rocks curved
inwards like the vast submerged jaw of some marine monster through
whose blunt toothlike projections the shiplong swell of the Pacific
streamed and fell On the southern shore the light yellow sands of
Punta de las Concepcion glittered like sunshine all the way to the
olivegardens and white domes of the Mission The two shores seemed to
typify the two different climates and civilizations separated by the
bay

The heavy woodland atmosphere was quickened by the salt breath of the
sea The stranger inhaled it meditatively

Thats the reef where the Tamalpais struck he said and moren fifty
miles out of her courseyes moren fifty miles from where she should
have bin It dont look natral Noitdontlooknatral

As he seemed to be speaking to himself the young girl who had been
gazing with far greater interest at the foreignlooking southern shore
felt confused and did not reply Then as if recalling her presence
Brother Seabright turned to her and said

Yes young lady and when you hear the old bell of the Tamalpais and
think of how it came here you may rejoice in the goodness of the Lord
that made even those who strayed from the straight course and the true
reckoning the means of testifying onto Him

But the young are quicker to detect attitudes and affectation than we
are apt to imagine and Cissy could distinguish a certain other straying
in this afterthought or moral of the preacher called up by her presence
and knew that it was not the real interest which the view had evoked
She had heard that he had been a sailor and with the tact of her sex
answered with what she thought would entertain him

I was a little girl when it happened and I heard that some sailors got
ashore down there and climbed up this gully from the rocks below
And they camped that nightfor there were no houses at West Woodlands
thenjust in the woods where our chapel now stands It was funny
wasnt itI mean she corrected herself bashfully it was strange
they chanced to come just there

But she had evidently hit the point of interest

What became of them he said quickly They never came to Horse Shoe
Settlement where the others landed from the wreck I never heard of
that boats crew or of ANY landing HERE

No They kept on over the range south to the Mission I reckon they
didnt know there was a way down on this side to Horse Shoe returned
Cissy

Brother Seabright moved on and continued his slow plodding march
But he kept a little nearer Cissy and she was conscious that he
occasionally looked at her Presently he said

You have a heavenly gift Miss Appleby

Cissy flushed and her hand involuntarily went to one of her long
distinguishing curls It might be THAT The preacher continued

Yes a voice like yours is a heavenly gift And you have properly
devoted it to His service Have you been singing long

About two years But Ive got to study a heap yet

The little birds dont think it necessary to study to praise Him said
the preacher sententiously

It occurred to Cissy that this was very unfair argument She said
quickly

But the little birds dont have to follow words in the hymnbooks You
dont give out lines to larks and bobolinks and blushed

The preacher smiled It was a very engaging smile Cissy thought that
lightened his hard mouth It enabled her to take heart of grace and
presently to chatter like the very birds she had disparaged Oh yes she
knew she had to learn a great deal more She had studied some already
She was taking lessons over at Point Concepcion where her aunt had
friends and she went three times a week The gentleman who taught her
was not a Catholic and of course he knew she was a Protestant She
would have preferred to live there but her mother and father were both
dead and had left her with her aunt She liked it better because it
was sunnier and brighter there She loved the sun and warmth She had
listened to what he had said about the dampness and gloom of the chapel
It was true The dampness was that dreadful sometimes it just ruined her
clothes and even made her hoarse Did he think they would really take
his advice and clear out the woods round the chapel

Would you like it he asked pleasantly

Yes

And you think you wouldnt pine so much for the sunshine and warmth of
the Mission

Im not pining said Cissy with a toss of her curls for anything or
anybody but I think the woods ought to be cleared out Its just as it
was when the runaways hid there

When the RUNAWAYS HID THERE said Brother Seabright quickly What
runaways

Why the boats crew said Cissy

Why do you call them runaways

I dont know Didnt YOU said Cissy simply Didnt you say they
never came back to Horse Shoe Bay Perhaps I had it from aunty But
I know its damp and creepy and when I was littler I used to be
frightened to be alone there practicing

Why said the preacher quickly

Oh I dont know hurried on Cissy with a vague impression that she
had said too much Only my fancy I guess

Well said Brother Seabright after a pause well see what can be
done to make a clearing there Birds sing best in the sunshine and YOU
ought to have some say about it

Cissys dimples and blushes came together this time Thats our
house she said suddenly with a slight accent of relief pointing to a
weatherbeaten farmhouse on the edge of the gorge I turn off here but
you keep straight on for the Mills theyre back in the woods a
piece But she stammered with a sudden sense of shame of forgotten
hospitality wont you come in and see aunty

No thank you not now He stopped turning his gaze from the house to
her How old is your house Was it there at the time of the wreck

Yes said Cissy

Its odd that the crew did not come there for help eh

Maybe they overlooked it in the darkness and the storm said Cissy
simply Goodby sir

The preacher held her hand for an instant in his powerful but gently
graduated grasp Goodby until evening service

Yes sir said Cissy

The young girl tripped on towards her house a little agitated and
conscious and yet a little proud as she saw the faces of her aunt her
uncle her two cousins and even her discarded escort Jo Adams at the
windows watching her

So said her aunt as she entered breathlessly ye walked home with
the preacher It was a speshal providence and manifestation for ye
Cissy I hope ye was mannerly and humbleand profited by the words of
grace

I dont know said Cissy putting aside her hat and cloak listlessly
He didnt talk much of anythingbut the old wreck of the Tamalpais

What said her aunt quickly

The wreck of the Tamalpais and the boats crew that came up the
gorge repeated the young girl

And what did HE know about the boats crew said her aunt hurriedly
fixing her black eyes on Cissy

Nothing except what I told him

What YOU told him echoed her aunt with an ominous color filling the
sallow hollows of her cheek

Yes He has been a sailor you knowand I thought it would interest
him and it did He thought it strange

Cecilia Jane Appleby said her aunt shrilly do you mean to say that
you threw away your chances of salvation and saving grace just to tell
gossiping tales that you knew was lies and evil report and false
witnesses

I only talked of what Id heard aunt Vashti said Cecilia
indignantly And he afterwards talked ofofmy voice and said I had
a heavenly gift she added with a slight quiver of her lip

Aunt Vashti regarded the girl sharply

And you may thank the Lord for that heavenly gift she said in a
slightly lowered voice for ef ye hadnt to use it tonight Id shut
ye up in your room to make it pay for yer foolish gaddin TONGUE And
I reckon Ill escort ye to chapel tonight myself miss and get shut o
some of this foolishness


II


The broad plaza of the Mission de la Concepcion had been baking in the
daylong sunlight Shining drifts from the outlying sand dunes blown
across the illpaved roadway radiated the heat in the faces of the few
loungers like the pricking of liliputian arrows and invaded even the
cactus hedges The hot air visibly quivered over the dark red tiles of
the tienda roof as if they were undergoing a second burning The black
shadow of a chimney on the whitewashed adobe wall was like a door or
cavernous opening in the wall itself the tops of the olive and pear
trees seen above it were russet and sere already in the fierce light
Even the moist breath of the sea beyond had quite evaporated before it
crossed the plaza and now rustled the leaves in the Mission garden with
a dry crepitant sound

Nevertheless it seemed to Cissy Appleby as she crossed the plaza a
very welcome change from West Woodlands Although the late winter rains
had ceased a month agoa few days after the revivalist preacher had
leftthe woods around the chapel were still sodden and heavy and the
threatened improvement in its site had not taken place Neither had the
preacher himself alluded to it again his evening sermonthe only other
one he preached therewas unexciting and he had in fact left West
Woodlands without any display of that extraordinary exhortatory faculty
for which he was famous Yet Cissy in spite of her enjoyment of the
dry hot Mission remembered him and also recalled albeit poutingly
his blunt suggesting that she was pining for it Nevertheless she
would like to have sung for him HEREsupposing it was possible to
conceive of a Sidon Brotherhood Chapel at the Mission It was a great
pity she thought that the Sidon Brotherhood and the Franciscan
Brotherhood were not more brotherly TOWARDS EACH OTHER Cissy belonged
to the former by hereditary right locality and circumstance but it is
to be feared that her theology was imperfect

She entered a lane between the Mission wall and a lighter iron fenced
inclosure once a part of the garden but now the appurtenance of a
private dwelling that was reconstructed over the heavy adobe shell of
some forgotten structure of the old ecclesiastical founders It was
pierced by many windows and openings and that sunlight and publicity
which the former padres had jealously excluded was now wooed from long
balconies and verandas by the new proprietor a well to do American
Elisha Braggs whose name was generously and euphoniously translated by
his native neighbors into Don Eliseo although a heretic had given
largess to the church in the way of restoring its earthquakeshaken
tower and in presenting a new organ to its dilapidated choir He had
further endeared himself to the conservative Spanish population by
introducing no obtrusive improvements by distributing his means through
the old channels by apparently inciting no further alien immigration
but contenting himself to live alone among them adopting their habits
customs and language A harmless musical taste and a disposition to
instruct the young boy choristers was equally balanced by great skill
in horsemanship and the personal management of a ranche of wild cattle
on the inland plains

Consciously pretty and prettily conscious in her whitestarched
rosesprigged muslin her pink parasol beribboned gypsy hat and the
long manelike curls that swung over her shoulders Cissy entered the
house and was shown to the large low drawingroom on the groundfloor
She once more inhaled its hot potpourri fragrance in which the spice of
the Castilian roseleaves of the garden was dominant A few boys whom
she recognized as the choristers of the Mission and her fellowpupils
were already awaiting her with some degree of anxiety and impatience
This fact and a certain quick animation that sprang to the blue eyes
of the master of the house as the rosesprigged frock and long curls
appeared at the doorway showed that Cissy was clearly the favorite
pupil

Elisha Braggs was a man of middle age with a figure somewhat rounded by
the adipose curves of a comfortable life and an air of fastidiousness
which was however occasionally at variance with what seemed to be
his original condition He greeted Cissy with a certain nervous
overconsciousness of his duties as host and teacher and then plunged
abruptly into the lesson It lasted an hour Cissy tactfully
dividing his somewhat exclusive instruction with the others and even
interpreting it to their slower comprehension When it was over the
choristers shyly departed according to their usual custom leaving
Cissy and Don Eliseoand occasionally one of the padres to more
informal practicing and performance Neither the ingenuousness of Cissy
nor the worldly caution of aunt Vashti had ever questioned the propriety
of these prolonged and secluded seances and the young girl herself
although by no means unaccustomed to the bashful attentions of the youth
of West Woodlands had never dreamed of these later musical interviews
as being anything but an ordinary recreation of her art The feeling of
gratitude and kindness she had for Don Eliseo her aunts friend had
never left her conscious or embarrassed when she was alone with him
But today possibly from his own nervousness and preoccupation she was
aware of some vague uneasiness and at an early opportunity rose to go
But Don Eliseo gently laid his hand on hers and said

Dont go yet I want to talk to you His touch suddenly reminded her
that once or twice before he had done the same thing and she had been
disagreeably impressed by it But she lifted her brown eyes to his with
an unconsciousness that was more crushing than a withdrawal of her hand
and waited for him to go on

It is such a long way for you to come and you have so little time to
stay when you are here that I am thinking of asking your aunt to let
you live here at the Mission as a pupil in the house of the Senora
Hernandez until your lessons are finished Padre Jose will attend to
the rest of your education Would you like it

Poor Cissys eyes leaped up in unaffected and sparkling affirmation
before her tongue replied To bask in this beloved sunshine for days
together to have this quaint Spanish life before her eyes and those
soft Spanish accents in her ears to forget herself in wandering in the
oldtime Mission garden beyond to have daily access to Mr Braggss
piano and the organ of the churchthis was indeed the realization
of her fondest dreams Yet she hesitated Somewhere in her inherited
Puritan nature was a vague conviction that it was wrong and it seemed
even to find an echo in the warning of the preacher this was what she
was pining for

I dont know she stammered I must ask auntie I shouldnt like to
leave her and theres the chapel

Isnt that revivalist preacher enough to run it for a while said her
companion halfsneeringly

The remark was not a tactful one

Mr Seabright hasnt been here for a month she answered somewhat
quickly But hes coming next Sunday and Im glad of it Hes a very
good man And theres nothing he dont notice He saw how silly it was
to stick the chapel into the very heart of the woods and he told them
so

And I suppose hell run up a brandnew meetinghouse out on the road
said Braggs smiling

No hes going to open up the woods and let the sun and light in and
clear out the underbrush

And whats that for

There was such an utter and abrupt change in the speakers voice and
mannerwhich until then had been lazily fastidious and confidentthat
Cissy was startled And the change being rude and dictatorial she was
startled into opposition She had wanted to say that the improvement had
been suggested by HER but she took a more aggressive attitude

Brother Seabright says its a question of religion and morals Its a
scandal and a wrong and a disgrace to the Word that the chapel should
have been put there

Don Eliseos face turned so white and waxy that Cissy would have noticed
it had she not femininely looked away while taking this attitude

I suppose thats a part of his sensation style and very effective he
said resuming his former voice and manner I must try to hear him some
day But now in regard to your coming here of course I shall consult
your aunt although I imagine she will have no objection I only wanted
to know how YOU felt about it He again laid his hand on hers

I should like to come very much said Cissy timidly and its very
kind of you Im sure but youll see what auntie says wont you She
withdrew her hand after momentarily grasping his as if his own act had
been only a parting salutation and departed

Aunt Vashti received Cissys account of her interview with a grim
satisfaction She did not know what ideas young gals had nowadays but
in HER time shed been fit to jump outer her skin at such an offer from
such a good man as Elisha Braggs And he was a rich man too And ef he
was goin to give her an edication free it wasnt goin to stop
there For her part she didnt like to put ideas in young girls
headsgoodness knows theyd enough foolishness already but if Cissy
made a Christian use of her gifts and tended to her edication and
privileges and made herself a fit helpmeet for any man she would say
that there were few men in these parts that was as comfble ketch as
Lish Braggs or would make as good a husband and provider

The blood suddenly left Cissys cheeks and then returned with
uncomfortable heat Her aunts words had suddenly revealed to her
the meaning of the uneasiness she had felt in Braggss house that
morningthe old repulsion that had come at his touch She had never
thought of him as a suitor or a beau before yet it now seemed perfectly
plain to her that this was the ulterior meaning of his generosity And
yet she received that intelligence with the same mixed emotions with
which she had received his offer to educate her She did not conceal
from herself the pride and satisfaction she felt in this presumptive
selection of her as his wife the worldly advantages that it promised
nor that it was a destiny far beyond her deserts Yet she was conscious
of exactly the same sense of wrongdoing in her preferencessomething
that seemed vaguely akin to that conviction of sin of which she had
heard so muchas when she received his offer of education It was this
mixture of fear and satisfaction that caused her alternate paling and
flushing yet this time it was the fear that came first Perhaps she was
becoming unduly sensitive The secretiveness of her sex came to her aid
here and she awkwardly changed the subject Aunt Vashti complacently
believing that her words had fallen on fruitful soil discreetly said no
more

It was a hot morning when Cissy walked alone to chapel early next
Sunday There was a dry irritation in the air which even the northwest
trades blowing through the seaward gorge could not temper and for the
first time in her life she looked forward to the leafy seclusion of the
buried chapel with a feeling of longing She had avoided her youthful
escort for she wished to practice alone for an hour before the service
with the new harmonium that had taken the place of the old accordion and
its unskillful performer Perhaps too there was a timid desire to be
at her best on the return of Brother Seabright and to show him with
a new performance that the heavenly gift had not been neglected She
opened the chapel with the key she always carried swished away an
intrusive squirrel left the door and window open for a moment until
the beating of frightened wings against the rafters had ceased and
after carefully examining the floor for spiders mice and other
creeping things brushed away a few fallen leaves and twigs from the top
of the harmonium Then with her long curls tossed over her shoulders
and hanging limply down the back of her new mapleleaf yellow
frockwhich was also a timid recognition of Brother Seabrights
returnand her brown eyes turned to the rafters this rustic St
Cecilia of the Coast Range began to sing The shell of the little
building dilated with the melody the sashes of the windows pulsated
the two ejected linnets joined in timidly from their coign of vantage in
the belfry outside and the limp vines above the porch swayed like her
curls Once she thought she heard stealthy footsteps without once she
was almost certain she felt the brushing of somebody outside against the
thin walls of the chapel and once she stopped to glance quickly at the
window with a strange instinct that some one was looking at her But she
quickly reflected that Brother Seabright would come there only when the
deacons did and with them Why she should think that it was Brother
Seabright or why Brother Seabright should come thus and at such a time
she could not have explained

He did not in fact make his appearance until later and after the
congregation had quite filled the chapel he did not moreover appear
to notice her as she sat there and when he gave out the hymn he
seemed to have quietly overlooked the new harmonium She sang her best
however and more than one of the audience thought that little Sister
Appleby had greatly improved Indeed it would not have seemed strange
to someremembering Brother Seabrights discursive oratoryif he had
made some allusion to it But he did not His heavy eyes moved slowly
over the congregation and he began

As usual he did not take a text But he would talk to them that morning
about The Conviction of Sin and the sense of wrongdoing that was
innate in the sinner This included all form of temptation for what
was temptation but the inborn consciousness of something to struggle
against and that was sin At this apparently concise exposition of
her own feelings in regard to Don Eliseos offer Cissy felt herself
blushing to the roots of her curls Could it be possible that Brother
Seabright had heard of her temptation to leave West Woodlands and
that this warning was intended for her He did not even look in her
direction Yet his next sentence seemed to be an answer to her own
mental query

Folks might ask he continued if even the young and inexperienced
should feel thisor was there a state of innocent guilt without
consciousness He would answer that question by telling them what had
happened to him that morning He had come to the chapel not by the
road but through the tangled woods behind them Cissy startedthrough
the thick brush and undergrowth that was choking the life out of this
little chapelthe wilderness that he had believed was never before
trodden by human feet and was known only to roaming beasts and vermin
But that was where he was wrong

In the stillness and listening silence a sudden cough from some one
in one of the back benches produced that instantaneous diversion of
attention common to humanity on such occasions Cissys curls swung
round with the others But she was surprised to see that Mr Braggs was
seated in one of the benches near the door and from the fact of
his holding a handkerchief to his mouth and being gazed at by his
neighbors it was evident that it was he who had coughed Perhaps he
had come to West Woodlands to talk to her aunt With the preacher
before her and her probable suitor behind her she felt herself again
blushing

Brother Seabright continued Yes he was WRONG for there before him in
the depths of the forest were two children They were looking at a bush
of pizon berriesthe deadly nightshade as it was fitly calledand
one was warning the other of its dangerous qualities

But how do you know its the pizon berry asked the other

Because its larger and nicer and bigger and easier to get than the
real good ones returned the other

And it was so Thus was the truth revealed from the mouths of babes
and sucklings even they were conscious of temptation and sin But here
there was another interruption from the back benches which proved
however to be only the suppressed giggle of a boyevidently the
youthful hero of the illustration surprised into nervous hilarity

The preacher then passed to the Conviction of Sin in its more familiar
phases Many brothers confounded this with DISCOVERY AND PUBLICITY It
was not their own sin finding them out but others discovering it
Until that happened they fancied themselves safe stilling their
consciences confounding the blinded eye of the world with the
allseeing eye of the Lord But were they safe even then Did not sooner
or later the sea deliver up its dead the earth what was buried in it
the wild woods what its depths had hidden Was not the foolish secret
the guilty secret the forgotten sin sure to be disclosed Then if they
could not fly from the testimony of His works if they could not evade
even their fellowman why did they not first turn to Him Why from the
penitent child at his mothers knee to the murderer on the scaffold did
they only at THE LAST confess unto Him

His voice and manner had suddenly changed From the rough note of
accusation and challenge it had passed into the equally rough but
broken and sympathetic accents of appeal Why did they hesitate longer
to confess their sinnot to manbut unto Him Why did they delay
Nowthat evening That very moment This was the appointed time He
entreated them in the name of religious faith in the name of a human
brotherly love His delivery was now no longer deliberate but
hurried and panting his speech now no longer chosen but made up
of reiterations and repetitions ejaculations and even incoherent
epithets His gestures and long intonations which began to take the
place of even that interrupted speech affected them more than his
reasoning Short sighs escaped them they swayed to and fro with the
rhythm of his voice and movements They had begun to comprehend
this exacerbation of emotionthis paroxysmal rhapsody This was the
dithyrambic exaltation they had ardently waited for They responded
quickly First with groans equally inarticulate murmurs of assent
shouts of Glory and the reckless invocation of sacred names Then a
wave of hysteria seemed to move the whole mass and broke into tears
and sobs among the women In her own excited consciousness it seemed
to Cissy that some actual struggle between good and evillike unto
the casting out of devilswas shaking the little building She cast a
hurried glance behind her and saw Mr Braggs sitting erect white and
scornful She knew that she too was shrinking from the speakernot
from any sense of conviction but because he was irritating and
disturbing her innate sense of fitness and harmonyand she was pained
that Mr Braggs should see him thus Meantime the weird invisible
struggle continued heightened and it seemed to her incited by the
partisan groans and exultant actions of those around her until suddenly
a wild despairing cry arose above the conflict A vague fear seized
herthe voice was familiar She turned in time to see the figure
of aunt Vashti rise in her seat with a hysterical outburst and fall
convulsively forward upon her knees She would have rushed to her side
but the frenzied woman was instantly caught by Deacon Shadwell and
surrounded by a group of her own sex and became hidden And when Cissy
recovered herself she was astonished to find Brother Seabrightwith
every trace of his past emotion vanished from his hardset facecalmly
taking up his coherent discourse in his ordinary level tones The
furious struggle of the moment before was over the chapel and its
congregation had fallen back into an exhausted and apathetic silence
Then the preacher gave out the hymnthe words were singularly jubilant
among that usually mournful collection in the book before herand Cissy
began it with a tremulous voice But it gained strength clearness and
volume as she went on and she felt thrilled throughout with a new human
sympathy she had never known before The preachers bass supported her
now for the first time not unmusicallyand the service was over

Relieved she turned quickly to join her aunt but a hand was laid
gently upon her shoulder It was Brother Seabright who had just stepped
from the platform The congregation knowing her to be the niece of the
hysteric woman passed out without disturbing them

You have indeed improved your gift Sister Cecilia he said gravely
You must have practiced much

Yesthat is noonly a little stammered Cissy

But excuse me I must look after auntie she added drawing timidly
away

Your aunt is better and has gone on with Sister Shadwell She is not
in need of your help and really would do better without you just now I
shall see her myself presently

But YOU made her sick already said Cissy with a sudden halfnervous
audacity You even frightened ME

Frightened you repeated Seabright looking at her quickly

Yes said Cissy meeting his gaze with brown truthful eyes Yes
when youwhen youmade those faces I like to hear you talk butshe
stopped

Brother Seabrights rare smile again lightened his face But it seemed
sadder than when she had first seen it

Then you have been practicing again at the Mission he said quietly
and you still prefer it

Yes said Cissy She wanted to appear as loyal to the Mission in
Brother Seabrights presence as she was faithful to West Woodlands
in Mr Braggss She had no idea that this was dangerously near to
coquetry So she said a little archly I dont see why YOU dont like
the Mission Youre a missionary yourself The old padres came here to
spread the Word So do you

But not in that way he said curtly Ive seen enough of them when
I was knocking round the world a seafaring man and a sinner I knew
themreceivers of the illgotten gains of adventurers fools and
scoundrels I knew themenriched by the spoils of persecution and
oppression gathering under their walls outlaws and fugitives from
justice and flinging an indulgence here and an absolution there as
they were paid for it Dont talk to me of THEMI know them

They were passing out of the chapel together and he made an impatient
gesture as if dismissing the subject Accustomed though she was to
the sweeping criticism of her Catholic friends by her West Woodlands
associates she was nevertheless hurt by his brusqueness She dropped
a little behind and they separated at the porch Notwithstanding
her anxiety to see her aunt she felt she could not now go to Deacon
Shadwells without seeming to follow himand after he had assured her
that her help was not required She turned aside and made her way slowly
towards her home

There she found that her aunt had not returned gathering from her uncle
that she was recovering from a fit of high strikes hysterics and
would be better alone Whether he underrated her complaint or had
a consciousness of his masculine helplessness in such disorders he
evidently made light of it And when Cissy afterwards a little ashamed
that she had allowed her momentary pique against Brother Seabright to
stand in the way of her duty determined to go to her aunt instead of
returning to the chapel that evening he did not oppose it She learned
also that Mr Braggs had called in the morning but finding that her
aunt Vashti was at chapel he had followed her there intending to
return with her But he had not been seen since the service and had
evidently returned to the Mission

But when she reached Deacon Shadwells house she was received by Mrs
Shadwell only Her aunt said that lady was physically better but
Brother Seabright had left partkler word that she was to see nobody
It was an extraordinary case of findin the Lord the like of which
had never been known before in West Woodlands and she Cissy would yet
be proud of one of her fammerly being speshally selected for grace
But the workins o salvation was not to be finicked away on worldly
things or even the affections of the flesh and if Cissy really loved
her aunt she wouldnt interfere with her while she was so to speak
still on the mourners bench wrastlin with the Sperret in their back
sittinroom But she might wait until Brother Seabrights return from
evening chapel after service

Cissy waited Nine oclock came but Brother Seabright did not return
Then a small but inconsequent dignity took possession of her and she
slightly tossed her long curls from her shoulders She was not going
to wait for any mans permission to see her own aunt If auntie did not
want to see her that was enough She could go home alone She didnt
want any one to go with her

Lifted and sustained by these lofty considerations with an erect head
and slightly ruffled mane well enwrapped in a becoming white merino
cloud the young girl stepped out on her homeward journey She
had certainly enough to occupy her mind and perhaps justify her
independence To have a suitor for her hand in the person of the
superior and wealthy Mr Braggsfor that was what his visit that
morning to West Woodlands meantand to be personally complimented
on her improvement by the famous Brother Seabright all within twelve
hours was something to be proud of even although it was mitigated
by her aunts illness her suitors abrupt departure and Brother
Seabrights momentary coldness and impatience Oddly enough this last
and apparently trivial circumstance occupied her thoughts more than the
others She found herself looking out for him in the windings of the
moonlit road and when at last she reached the turning towards the
little wood and chapel her small feet unconsciously lingered until
she felt herself blushing under her fleecy cloud She looked down the
lane From the point where she was standing the lights of the chapel
should have been plainly visible but now all was dark It was nearly
ten oclock and he must have gone home by another road Then a spirit
of adventure seized her She had the key of the chapel in her pocket
She remembered she had left a small black Spanish fana former gift of
Mr Braggs lying on the harmonium She would go and bring it away and
satisfy herself that Brother Seabright was not there still It was but a
step and in the clear moonlight

The lane wound before her like a silver stream except where it was
interrupted and bridged over by jagged black shadows The chapel itself
was black the clustering trees around it were black also the porch
seemed to cover an inky well of shadow the windows were rayless and
dead and in the chancel one still left open showed a yawning vault of
obscurity within Nevertheless she opened the door softly glided into
the dark depths and made her way to the harmonium But here the sound
of footsteps without startled her she glanced hurriedly through the
open window and saw the figure of Elisha Braggs suddenly revealed in
the moonlight as he crossed the path behind the chapel He was closely
followed by two peons whom she recognized as his servants at the
Mission and they each carried a pickaxe From their manner it was
evident that they had no suspicion of her presence in the chapel But
they had stopped and were listening Her heart beat quickly with
a sudden instinct she ran and bolted the door But it was evidently
another intruder they were watching for she presently saw Brother
Seabright quietly cross the lane and approach the chapel The three men
had disappeared but there was a sudden shout the sound of scuffling
the deep voice of Brother Seabright saying Back there will you
Hands off and a pause She could see nothing she listened in every
pulse Then the voice of Brother Seabright arose again quite clearly
slowly and as deliberately as if it had risen from the platform in the
chapel

Lish Barker I thought as much Lish Barker first mate of the
Tamalpais who was said to have gone down with a boats crew and the
ships treasure after she struck I THOUGHT I knew that face today

Yes said the voice of him whom she had known as Elisha Braggsyes
and I knew YOUR face Jim Seabright exwhaler slaver pirate and
bosn of the Highflyer marooned in the South Pacific where you found
the Lordha haand became the psalmsinging converted American
sailor preacher

I am not ashamed before men of my past which every one knows
returned Seabright slowly But what of YOURS Elisha BarkerYOURS
that has made you sham death itself to hide it from them What of
YOURSspent in the sloth of your illgotten gains Turn sinner turn
Turn Elisha Braggs while there is yet time

Belay there Brother Seabright were not INSIDE your gospelshop just
now Keep your palaver for those that need it Let me pass before I
have to teach you that you havent to deal with a gang of hysterical old
women tonight

But not until you know that one of those womenVashti Whiteby
Gods grace converted of her sins has confessed her secret and yours
Elisha Barker Yes She has told me how her sisters husbandthe father
of the young girl you are trying to lure awayhelped you off that night
with your booty took his miserable reward and lived and died in exile
with the rest of your wretched crewafraid to return to his home and
countrywhilst youshameless and impenitentlived in slothful ease at
the Mission

Liar Let me pass

Not until I know your purpose here tonight

Then take the consequences Here Pedro Ramon Seize him Tie him head
and heels together and toss him in the bush

The sound of scuffling recommenced The struggle seemed fierce and long
with no breath wasted in useless outcry Then there was a bright flash
a muffled report and the stinging and fire of gunpowder at the window

Transfixed with fear Cissy cast a despairing glance around her Ah
the bellrope In another instant she had grasped it frantically in her
hands

All the fear indignation horror sympathy and wild appeal for help
that had arisen helplessly in her throat and yet remained unuttered now
seemed to thrill through her fingers and the tightened rope and broke
into frantic voice in the clanging metal above her The whole chapel
the whole woodland the clear moonlit sky above was filled with its
alarming accents It shrieked implored protested summoned and
threatened in one ceaseless outcry seeming to roll over and overas
indeed it didin leaps and bounds that shook the belfry Never before
even in the blows of the striking surges had the bell of the Tamalpais
clamored like that Once she heard above the turmoil the shaking of the
door against the bolt that still held firmly once she thought she
heard Seabrights voice calling to her once she thought she smelled
the strong smoke of burning grass But she kept on until the window was
suddenly darkened by a figure and Brother Seabright leaping in caught
her in his arms as she was reeling fainting but still clinging to the
rope But his strong presence and some powerful magnetism in his touch
restored her

You have heard all he said

Yes

Then for your aunts sake for your dead fathers sake FORGET all
That wretched man has fled with his wounded hirelingslet his sin
go with him But the village is alarmedthe brethren may be here any
moment Neither question nor deny what I shall tell them Fear nothing
God will forgive the silence that leaves the vengeance to His hands
alone Voices and footsteps were heard approaching the chapel Brother
Seabright significantly pressed her hand and strode towards the door
Deacon Shadwell was first to enter

You hereBrother Seabright What has happened

God be praised said Brother Seabright cheerfully nothing of
consequence The danger is over Yet but for the courage and presence
of mind of Sister Appleby a serious evil might have been done He
paused and with another voice turned halfinterrogatively towards her
Some children or a passing tramp had carelessly thrown matches in
the underbrush and they were ignited beside the chapel Sister Appleby
chancing to return here for

For my fan said Cissy with a timid truthfulness of accent

Found herself unable to cope with it and it occurred to her to give
the alarm you heard I happened to be passing and was first to respond
Happily the flames had made but little headway and were quickly beaten
down It is all over now But let us hope that the speedy clearing out
of the underbrush and the opening of the woods around the chapel will
prevent any recurrence of the alarm of tonight



That the lesson thus reiterated by Brother Seabright was effective the
following extract from the columns of the Whale Point Gazette may
not only be offered as evidence but may even give the cautious reader
further light on the episode itself


STRANGE DISCOVERY AT WEST WOODLANDSTHE TAMALPAIS MYSTERY AGAIN

The improvements in the clearing around the Sidon Chapel at West
Woodlands undertaken by the Rev James Seabright have disclosed
another link in the mystery which surrounded the loss of the Tamalpais
some years ago at Whale Mouth Point It will be remembered that the boat
containing Adams  Cos treasure the Tamalpais first officer and
a crew of four men was lost on the rocks shortly after leaving the
illfated vessel None of the bodies were ever recovered and the
treasure itself completely baffled the search of divers and salvers A
lidless box bearing the mark of Adams  Co of the kind in which their
treasure was usually shipped was yesterday found in the woods behind
the chapel half buried in brush bark and windfalls There were no
other indications except the traces of a campfire at some remote
period probably long before the building of the chapel But how and
when the box was transported to the upland and by whose agency still
remains a matter of conjecture Our reporter who visited the Rev Mr
Seabright who has lately accepted the regular ministry of the chapel
was offered every facility for information but it was evident that the
early settlers who were cognizant of the factif there were anyare
either dead or have left the vicinity




THE HOMECOMING OF JIM WILKES


I


For many minutes there had been no sound but the monotonous drumming of
the rain on the roof of the coach the swishing of wheels through the
gravelly mud and the momentary clatter of hoofs upon some rocky outcrop
in the road Conversation had ceased the lighthearted young editor in
the front seat more than suspected of dangerous levity had relapsed
into silence since the heavy man in the middle seat had taken to
regarding the ceiling with ostentatious resignation and the thin female
beside him had averted her respectable bonnet An occasional lurch of
the coach brought down a fringe of raindrops from its eaves that filmed
the windows and shut out the sodden prospect already darkening into
night There had been a momentary relief in their hurried dash through
Summit Springs and the spectacle of certain newly arrived County
Delegates crowding the veranda of its one hotel but that was now three
miles behind The young editors sole resource was to occasionally steal
a glance at the face of the one passenger who seemed to be in sympathy
with him but who was too far away for easy conversation It was the
halfamused halfperplexed face of a young man who had been for
some time regarding him from a remote corner of the coach with an odd
mingling of admiring yet cogitating interest which however had never
extended to any further encouragement than a faint sad smile Even this
at last faded out in the growing darkness the powerful coach lamps on
either side that flashed on the wayside objects gave no light to the
interior Everybody was slowly falling asleep Suddenly everybody woke
up to find that the coach was apparently standing still When it had
stopped no one knew The young editor lowered his window The coach lamp
on that side was missing but nothing was to be seen In the distance
there appeared to be a faint splashing

Well called out an impatient voice from the box above what do you
make it It was the authoritative accents of Yuba Bill the driver and
everybody listened eagerly for the reply

It came faintly from the distance and the splashing Almost four feet
here and deepening as you go

Dead water

Noback water from the Fork

There was a general movement towards the doors and windows The
splashing came nearer Then a light flashed on the trees the windows
andtwo feet of yellow water peacefully flowing beneath them The thin
female gave a slight scream

Theres no danger said the Expressman now wading towards them with
the coach lamp in his hand But well have to pull round out of it and
go back to the Springs Theres no getting past this break tonight

Why didnt you let us know this before said the heavy man indignantly
from the window

Jim said the driver with that slow deliberation which instantly
enforced complete attention

Yes Bill

Have you got a spare copy of that reglar bulletin that the Stage
Kempany issoos every ten minutes to each passenger to tell em where we
are how far it is to the next place and wots the state o the weather
ginrally

No said the Expressman grimly as he climbed to the box theres not
one left Why

Cos the Emperor of Chinys inside wantin one Hoop Keep your seats
down there Glang the whip cracked there was a desperate splashing
a backward and forward jolting of the coach the glistening wet flanks
and tossing heads of the leaders seen for a moment opposite the windows
a sickening swirl of the whole body of the vehicle as if parting from
its axles a long straight dragging pull andpresently the welcome
sound of hoofs once more beating the firmer ground

Hi Hold updriver

It was the editors quiet friend who was leaning from the window

Isnt Wilkess ranch just off here

Yes half a mile along the ridge I reckon returned the driver
shortly

Well if youre not going on tonight Id get off and stop there

I reckon your heads level stranger said Bill approvingly for
theyre about chock full at the Springs House

To descend the passenger was obliged to pass out by the middle seat
and before the young editor As he did so he cast a shy look on him and
leaning over said hesitatingly in a lower voice I dont think you
will be able to get in at the Springs Hotel Ififyou care to come
with me totothe ranch I can take care of you

The young editora man of actionpaused for an instant only Then
seizing his bag he said promptly Thank you and followed his
newlyfound friend to the ground The whip cracked the coach rolled
away

You know Wilkes he said

Yeees Hes my father

Ah said the editor cheerfully then youre going home

Yes

It was quite light in the open and the stranger after a moments
survey of the prospecta survey that however seemed to be
characterized by his previous hesitationsaid This way crossed
the road and began to follow a quite plain but long disused wagon track
along the slope His manner was still so embarrassed that the young
editor after gayly repeating his thanks for his companions thoughtful
courtesy followed him in silence At the end of ten minutes they had
reached some cultivated fields and orchards the stranger brightened
although still with a preoccupied air quickened his pace and then
suddenly stopped When the editor reached his side he was gazing with
apparently still greater perplexity upon the level half obliterated
and blackened foundations of what had been a large farmhouse

Why its been burnt down he said thoughtfully

The editor stared at him Burnt down it certainly had been but by no
means recently Grasses were already springing up from the charred
beams in the cellar vines were trailing over the fallen chimneys
excavations already old had been made among the ruins When were you
here last the editor asked abruptly

Five years ago said the stranger abstractedly

Five yearsand you knew nothing of THIS

No I was in Tahiti Australia Japan and China all the time

And you never heard from home

No You see I quoled with the old man and ran away

And you didnt write to tell them you were coming

No He hesitated and then added Never thought o coming till I saw
YOU

Me

Yes you andthe high water

Do you mean to say said the young editor sharply that you brought
MEan utter stranger to youout of that coach to claim the hospitality
of a father you had quarreled withhadnt seen for five years and
didnt know if he would receive you

Yesyou see thats just WHY I did it You see I reckoned my chances
would be better to see him along with a cheerful chipper fellow
like you I didnt of course kalkilate on this he added pointing
dejectedly to the ruins

The editor gasped then a sudden conception of the unrivaled absurdity
of the situation flashed upon himof his passively following the
amiable idiot at his side in order to contemplate by the falling rain
and lonely night a heap of sodden ruins while the coach was speeding
to Summit Springs and shelter and above all the reason WHY he was
inviteduntil putting down his bag he leaned upon his stick and
laughed until the tears came to his eyes

At which his companion visibly brightened I told you so he said
cheerfully I knew youd be able to take itand the old manin THAT
WAY and that would have fetched him round

For Heavens sake dont talk any more said the editor wiping his
eyes but try to remember if you ever had any neighbors about here
where we can stay tonight We cant walk to Summit Springs and we cant
camp out on these ruins

There didnt use to be anybody nearer than the Springs

But that was five years ago you say said the editor impatiently
and although your father probably moved away after the house burned
down the countrys been thickly settled since then That field has been
lately planted There must be another house beyond Lets follow the
trail a little farther

They tramped along in silence this time the editor leading Presently
he stopped Theres a housein thereamong the trees he said
pointing Whose is it

The stranger shook his head dubiously Although apparently unaffected by
any sentimental consideration of his fathers misfortune the spectacle
of the blackened ruins of the homestead had evidently shaken his
preconceived plans It wasnt there in MY time he said musingly

But it IS there in OUR time responded the editor briskly and I
propose to go there From what you have told me of your fathereven if
his house were still standingour chances of getting supper and a bed
from him would be doubtful I suppose he continued as they moved on
together you left him in angerfive years ago

Yees

Did he say anything as you left

I dont remember anything particular that he SAID

Well what did he DO

Shot at me from the window

Ah said the young editor softly Nevertheless they walked on for some
time in silence Gradually a white picket fence came into view at right
angles with the trail and a man appeared walking leisurely along what
seemed to be the regularly traveled road beside it The editor who had
taken matters in his own hands without speaking to his companion ran
quickly forward and accosted the stranger briefly stating that he had
left the stagecoach with a companion because it was stopped by high
water and asked without entering into further details to be directed
to some place where they could pass the night The man quite as briefly
directed him to the house among the trees which he said was his own
and then leisurely pursued his way along the road The young editor
ran back to his companion who had halted in the dripping shadow of a
sycamore and recounted his good fortune

I didnt he added say anything about your father You can make
inquiries yourself later

I reckon there wont be much need of that returned his companion
You didnt take much note o that man did you

Not much said the editor

Well THATS MY FATHER and I reckon that new house must be his


II


The young editor was a little startled The man he had just quitted
certainly was not dangerous looking and yet remembering what his
son had said there WERE homicidal possibilities Look here he said
quickly hes not there NOW Why dont you seize the opportunity to
slip into the house make peace with your mother and sisters and get
them to intercede with your father when he returns

Thar aint any mother she died afore I left My sister Almirys a
little girlthough thats four years ago and mebbee shes growed
My brothers and me didnt pull together much But I was thinkin that
mebbee YOU might go in thar for me first and see how the land lays
then sorter tell em bout me in your takin chipper easy way
make em laugh and when youve squared emIll be hangin round
outsideyou kin call ME in Dont you see

The young editor DID see Ridiculous as the proposal would have seemed
to him an hour ago it now appeared practical and even commended itself
to his taste His name was well known in the county and his mediation
might be effective Perhaps his vanity was slightly flattered by his
companions faith in him perhaps he was not free from a certain human
curiosity to know the rest perhaps he was more interested than he cared
to confess in the helpless homeseeker beside him

But you must tell me something more of yourself and your fortune and
prospects Theyll be sure to ask questions

Mebbee they wont But you can say Ive done wellmade my pile over
in Australia and aint comin on THEM Remembersay I aint comin on
them

The editor nodded and then as if fearful of letting his present
impulse cool ran off towards the house

It was large and respectable looking and augured well for the present
fortunes of the Wilkess The editor had determined to attack the
citadel on its weaker feminine side and when the front door was opened
to his knock asked to see Miss Almira Wilkes The Irish servant showed
him into a comfortable looking sittingroom and in another moment with
a quick rustle of skirts in the passage a very pretty girl impulsively
entered From the first flash of her keen blue eyes the editora fair
student of the sexconceived the idea that she had expected somebody
else from the second that she was an arrant flirt and did not intend
to be disappointed This much was in his favor

Spurred by her provoking eyes and the novel situation he stated his
business with an airy lightness and humor that seemed to justify
his late companions estimate of his powers But even in his cynical
attitude he was unprepared for the girls reception of his news He had
expected some indignation or even harshness towards this man whom he was
beginning to consider as a kind of detrimental outcast or prodigal but
he was astounded at the complete and utter indifferencethe frank and
heartless unconcernwith which she heard of his return When she had
followed the narrator rather than his story to the end she languidly
called her brothers from the adjoining room This gentleman Mr Grey
of the Argus has come across Jimand Jim is calculating to come here
and see father

The two brothers stared at Grey slightly shrugged their shoulders with
the same utter absence of fraternal sympathy or concern which the girl
had shown and said nothing

One moment said Grey a little warmly I have no desire to penetrate
family secrets but would you mind telling me if there is any grave
reason why he should not come Was there any scandalous conduct
unpardonable offenselet us even sayany criminal act on his part
which makes his return to this roof impossible

The three looked at each other with a dull surprise that ended in a
vacant wondering smile No no they said in one voice No only

Only what asked Grey impatiently

Dad just hates him

Like pizon smiled Almira

The young editor rose with a slight increase of color Look here said
the girl whose dimples had deepened as she keenly surveyed him as
if detecting some amorous artifice under his show of interest for her
brother Dads gone down to the sheepfold and wont be back for an
hour Yo might bringYO FRIENDin

He aint wantin anything Aint dead broke nor nothin eh
suggested one of the brothers dubiously

Grey hastened to assure them of Jims absolute solvency and even
enlarged considerably on his Australian fortune They looked relieved
but not interested

Go and fetch him said the witch archly hovering near Grey with
dancing eyes and mind YO come back too

Grey hesitated a moment and then passed out in the dark porch A
dripping figure emerged from the trees opposite It was Jim

Your sister and brothers will see you said Grey hastily to avoid
embarrassing details HE wont be here for an hour But Id advise you
to make the most of your time and get the goodwill of your sister
He would have drawn back to let the prodigal pass in alone but the man
appealingly seized his arm and Grey was obliged to reenter with him
He noticed however that he breathed hard

They turned slightly towards their relative but did not offer to
shake hands with him nor did he with them He sat down sideways on an
unoffered chair The old house got burnt he said wiping his lips
and then drying his wet hair with his handkerchief

As the remark was addressed to no one in particular it was some seconds
before the elder brother replied Yes

Almiras growed

Again no one felt called upon to answer and Almira glanced archly at
the young editor as if he might have added and improved

Youve done well returned one of the brothers tentatively

Yes Im all right said Jim

There was another speechless interval Even the conversational Grey felt
under some unhallowed spell of silence that he could not break

I see the old well is there yet said Jim wiping his lips again

Where dad was once goin to chuck you down for givin him back talk
said the younger brother casually

To Mr Greys relief and yet astonishment Jim burst into a loud laugh
and rubbed his legs Thats sohow old times DO come back

And said the brighteyed Almira theres that old butternuttree that
you shinned up one day when we set the hounds on you Goodness how you
scooted

Again Jim laughed loudly and nodded Yes the same old butternut How
you DO remember Almira This admiringly

And dont you remember Delia Short continued Almira pleased at the
admiration and perhaps a little exalted at the singular attention which
the young editor was giving to those cheerful reminiscences She you
know you was reglarly sick after so that we always allowed she kinder
turned yo brain afore you went away Well all the while you were
courtin her it appears she was secretly married to Joyo friendJo
Stacy Lord there was a talk about that and about yo all along
thinkin yo had chances Yo friend here with an arch glance at Grey
whos allus puttin folks in the newspapers orter get a hold on that

Jim again laughed louder than the others and rubbed his lips Grey
however offered only the tribute of a peculiar smile and walked to the
window You say your father will return in an hour he said turning
to the elder brother

Yes unless he kept on to Watsons

Where said Jim suddenly

It struck Grey that his voice had changedor rather that he was now
speaking for the first time in his natural tone

Watsons just over the bridge explained his brother If he went
there he wont be back till ten

Jim picked up his India rubber cape and hat said I reckon Ill just
take a turn outside until he gets back and walked towards the door
None of his relatives moved nor seemed to offer any opposition Grey
followed him quickly Ill go with you he said

No returned Jim with singular earnestness You stay here and keep
em up cheerful like this Theyre doing all this for YOU you know
Almirys just this chipper only on your account

Seeing the young man was inflexible Grey returned grimly to the room
but not until he had noticed with some surprise that Jim immediately
on leaving the house darted off at a quick run through the rain and
darkness Preoccupied with this and perhaps still influenced by the
tone of the previous conversation he did not respond readily to the
fair Almiras conversational advances and was speedily left to a seat
by the fire alone At the end of ten minutes he regretted he had ever
come when half an hour had passed he wondered if he had not better try
to reach the Summit alone With the lapse of an hour he began to feel
uneasy at Jims prolonged absence in spite of the cold indifference
of the household Suddenly he heard stamping in the porch a muttered
exclamation and the voices of the two brothers in the hall Why dad
whats up Yo look half drowned

The door opened upon the sodden steaming figure of the old man whom he
had met on the road followed by the two sons But he was evidently
more occupied and possessed by some mental passion than by his physical
discomfort Yet strong and dominant over both he threw off his wet coat
and waistcoat as he entered and marched directly to the fire Utterly
ignoring the presence of a stranger he suddenly turned and faced his
family

Half drowned Yes and I might have been hull drowned for that matter
The back water of the Fork is all over Watsons and the bridge is gone
I stumbled onto this end of it in the dark and went off head first
into twenty feet of water Tried to fight my way out but the current
was agin me Id bin down twice and was going down for the third
time when somebody grabbed me by the scruff o my neck and under the
armsoand swam me to the bank When I scrambled up I sez I cant
see your face sez I I dont know who you are sez I but I reckon
youre a white man and clear grit sez I and theres my hand on it
And he grabs it and sez Were quits and scooted out o my sight
And continued the old man staring at their faces and raising his voice
almost to a scream who do you think it was Why THAT SNEAKIN HOUND
OF A BROTHER OF YOURSJIM Jim the scallawag that I booted outer the
ranch five years ago crawlin writhin back again after all these
years to insult his old fathers gray hairs And some of youby
Godonce thought that I was hard on him



The sun was shining brightly the next morning as the young editor halted
the up coach in the now dried hollow As he was clambering to a seat
beside the driver his elbow was jogged at the window Looking down he
saw the face of Jim

We had a gay talk last night remembering old times didnt we said
the prodigal cheerfully

Yes butwhere are you going now

Back to Australia I reckon But it was mighty good to drop in on the
old homestead once more

Rather said the editor clinging to the window and lingering in
midair to the manifest impatience of Yuba Bill but I saylook
herewere you QUITE satisfied

Jims hand tightened around the young editors as he answered
cheerfully Yes But his face was turned away from the window
