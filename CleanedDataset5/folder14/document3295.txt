EMMA LAZARUS Written for The Century Magazine

Born July 22 1849 Died November 19 1887


One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life so hidden
and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus but while her
memory is fresh and the echo of her songs still lingers in these pages
we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more and to note the
traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before
the world Of dramatic episode or climax in her life there is none
outwardly all was placid and serene like an untroubled stream whose
depths alone hold the strong quick tide The story of her life is the
story of a mind of a spirit ever seeking ever striving and pressing
onward and upward to new truth and light Her works are the mirror of
this progress In reviewing them the first point that strikes us is the
precocity or rather the spontaneity of her poetic gift She was a born
singer poetry was her natural language and to write was less effort
than to speak for she was a shy sensitive child with strange reserves
and reticences not easily putting herself en rapport with those
around her Books were her world from her earliest years in them she
literally lost and found herself She was eleven years old when the War
of Succession broke out which inspired her first lyric outbursts
Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen and
seventeen were collected and constituted her first published volume
Crude and immature as these productions naturally were and utterly
condemned by the writers later judgment they are nevertheless highly
interesting and characteristic giving as they do the keynote of
much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life One cannot fail to
be rather painfully impressed by the profound melancholy pervading
the book The opening poem is In Memoriamon the death of a school
friend and companion and the two following poems also have death for
theme On a Lock of my Mothers Hair gives us reflections on growing
old These are the four poems written at the age of fourteen There is
not a wholly glad and joyous strain in the volume and we might smile
at the recurrence of broken vows broken hearts and broken lives in the
experience of this maiden just entered upon her teens were it not
that the innocent child herself is in such deadly earnest The two long
narrative poems Bertha and Elfrida are tragic in the extreme Both
are dashed off apparently at white heat Elfrida over fifteen hundred
lines of blank verse in two weeks Bertha in three and a half We
have said that Emma Lazarus was a born singer but she did not sing
like a bird for joy of being alive and of being young alas there is
no hint in these youthful effusions except inasmuch as this unrelieved
gloom this ignorance of values so to speak is a sign of youth
common especially among gifted persons of acute and premature
sensibilities whose imagination not yet focused by reality
overreached the mark With Emma Lazarus however this sombre streak has
a deeper root something of birth and temperament is in itthe stamp
and heritage of a race born to suffer But dominant and fundamental
though it was Hebraism was only latent thus far It was classic
and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her She pictures
Aphrodite the beautiful arising from the waves and the beautiful
Apollo and his lovesDaphne pursued by the god changing into the
laurel and the enamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower Beauty for
its own sake supreme and unconditional charmed her primarily and
to the end Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan ideathe
absolute unity and identity of man with nature as symbolized in the
Greek myths where every natural force becomes a person and where in
turn persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature
again

In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not
appearHeine the Greek Heine the Jew Heine the Romanticist as Emma
Lazarus herself has styled him and already in this early volume of hers
we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards so plainly
declared itself Foremost among the translations are a number of
his songs rendered with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely
combined Four years later at the age of twentyone she published her
second volume Admetus and Other Poems which at once took rank as
literature both in America and England and challenged comparison with
the work of established writers Of classic themes we have Admetus and
Orpheus and of romantic the legend of Tannhauser and of the saintly
Lohengrin All are treated with an artistic finish that shows perfect
mastery of her craft without detracting from the freshness and flow of
her inspiration While sounding no absolutely new note in the world
she yet makes us aware of a talent of unusual distinction and a highly
endowed naturea sort of tact of sentiment and expression an instinct
of the true and beautiful and that quick intuition which is like
secondsight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external
stimulus But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volume that
most deeply interest us We come upon experience of life in these pages
not in the ordinary sense however of outward activity and movement
but in the hidden undercurrent of being The epochs of our life are not
in the visible facts but in the silent thoughts by the wayside as we
walk This is the motto drawn from Emerson which she chooses for her
poem of Epochs which marks a pivotal moment in her life Difficult
to analyze difficult above all to convey if we would not encroach
upon the domain of private and personal experience is the drift of
this poem or rather cycle of poems that ring throughout with a deeper
accent and a more direct appeal than has yet made itself felt It is the
drama of the human soulthe mystic winged and flickering butterfly
flitting between earth and sky in its passage from birth to death

A golden morning of June Sweet empty sky without a stain Sunlight
and mist and ripple of rainfed rills A murmur and a singing
manifold


 What simple things be these the soul to raise
 To bounding joy and make young pulses beat
 With nameless pleasure finding life so sweet


Such is youth a June day fair and fresh and tender with dreams and
longing and vague desire The morn lingers and passes but the noon has
not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise the sunshine
dies the air grows thick and heavy the lightnings flash the thunder
breaks among the hills rolls and gathers and grows until


 Behold yon bolt struck home
 And over ruined fields the storm hath come


Now we have the phases of the soulthe shock and surprise of grief in
the face of the world made desolate Loneliness and despair for a space
and then like stars in the night the new births of the spirit the
wonderful outcoming from sorrow the mild light of patience at first
hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil the new meaning
and worth of life beyond sorrow beyond joy and finally duty the
holiest word of all that leads at last to victory and peace The poem
rounds and completes itself with the close of the long rich day and
the release of


 The mystic winged and flickering butterfly
 A human soul that drifts at liberty
 Ah who can tell to what strange paradise
 To what undreamedof fields and lofty skies


We have dwelt at some length upon this poem which seems to us in a
certain sense subjective and biographical but upon closer analysis
there is still another conclusion to arrive at In Epochs we have
doubtless the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer
and profoundly working upon her sensibilities not however by direct
but reflex action as it were and through sympathetic emotionthe
emotion of the deeplystirred spectator of the artist the poet who
lives in the lives of others and makes their joys and their sorrows his
own

Before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to the
shaping of mind and character The poem of Admetus is dedicated to
my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson Emma Lazarus was between seventeen and
eighteen years of age when the writings of Emerson fell into her hands
and it would be difficult to overestimate the impression produced upon
her As she afterwards wrote To how many thousand youthful hearts has
not his word been the beaconnay more the guiding starthat led them
safely through periods of mental storm and struggle Of no one is this
more true than herself Left to a certain extent without compass or
guide without any positive or effective religious training this was
the first great moral revelation of her life We can easily realize
the chaos and ferment of an overstimulated brain steeped in romantic
literature and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination
Who can tell what is true what is false in a world where fantasy is as
real as fact Emersons word fell like truth itself a shaft of light
shot from the zenith a golden rule of thought and action His books
were bread and wine to her and she absorbed them into her very being
She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master that fount of wisdom
and goodness and it was her great privilege during these years to be
brought into personal relations with him From the first he showed her
a marked interest and sympathy which became for her one of the most
valued possessions of her life He criticised her work with the fine
appreciation and discrimination that made him quick to discern the
quality of her talent as well as of her personality and he was no doubt
attracted by her almost transparent sincerity and singleness of soul as
well as by the simplicity and modesty that would have been unusual even
in a person not gifted He constituted himself in a way her literary
mentor advised her as to the books she should read and the attitude of
mind she should cultivate For some years he corresponded with her very
faithfully his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances
and give evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and
a high incentive But encouragement even from so illustrious a source
failed to elate the young poetess or even to give her a due sense of
the importance and value of her work or the dignity of her vocation
We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingness to
assert herself or claim any prerogativesomething even morbid
and exaggerated which we know not how to define whether as over
sensitiveness or indifference Once finished the heat and glow of
composition spent her writings apparently ceased to interest her She
often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimate friends and
the public verdict as to their excellence could not reassure or satisfy
her The explanation is not far perhaps to seek Was it not the
EwigWeibliche that allows no prestige but its own Emma Lazarus was
a true woman too distinctly feminine to wish to be exceptional or to
stand alone and apart even by virtue of superiority

A word now as to her life and surroundings She was one of a family of
seven and her parents were both living Her winters were passed in
New York and her summers by the sea In both places her life was
essentially quiet and retired The success of her book had been mainly
in the world of letters In no wise tricked out to catch the public
eye her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure but were
destined slowly to take their proper place and give her the rank that
she afterwards held

For some years now almost everything that she wrote was published in
Lippincotts Magazine then edited by John Foster Kirk and we shall
still find in her poems the method and movement of her life Nature
is still the fount and mirror reflecting and again reflected in the
soul We have picture after picture almost to satiety until we grow
conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vital play to the
thought as though the brain were spending itself in dreamings and
reverie the heart feeding upon itself and the life choked by its
own fullness without due outlet Happily however the heavy cloud of
sadness has lifted and we feel the subsidence of waves after a storm
She sings Matins


 Does not the morn break thus
 Swift bright victorious
 With new skies cleared for us
 Over the soul stormtost
 Her night was long and deep
 Strange visions vexed her sleep
 Strange sorrows bade her weep
 Her faith in dawn was lost


 No halt no rest for her
 The immortal wanderer
 From sphere to higher sphere
 Toward the pure source of day
 The new light shames her fears
 Her faithlessness and tears
 As the new sun appears
 To light her godlike way


Nature is the perpetual resource and consolation T is good to be
alive she says and why Simply


 To see the light
 That plays upon the grass to feel and sigh
 With perfect pleasure the mild breeze stir
 Among the garden roses red and white
 With whiffs of fragrancy


She gives us the breath of the pines and of the cool salt seas
illimitably sparkling Her ears drink the ripple of the tide and she
stops


 To gaze as one who is not satisfied
 With gazing at the large bright breathing sea


Phantasies after Robert Schumann is the most complete and perfect
poem of this period Like Epochs it is a cycle of poems and the
verse has caught the very trick of musicalluring baffling and
evasive This time we have the landscape of the night the glamour of
moon and starspictures half real and half unreal mystic imaginings
fancies dreams and the enchantment of faerie and throughout the
unanswered cry the eternal Wherefore of destiny Dawn ends the song
with a fine clear note the return of day nights misty phantoms
rolled away and the world itself again green sparkling and breathing
freshness

In 1874 she published Alide a romance in prose drawn from Goethes
autobiography It may be of interest to quote the letter she received
from Tourgeneff on this occasion


 Although generally speaking I do not think it advisable
 to take celebrated men especially poets and artists as a
 subject for a novel still I am truly glad to say that I
 have read your book with the liveliest interest It is
 very sincere and very poetical at the same time the life
 and spirit of Germany have no secrets for you and your
 characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is
 strong I feel very proud of the approbation you give to
 my works and of the influence you kindly attribute to them
 on your own talent an author who write as you do is not
 a pupil in art any more he is not far from being himself
 a master


Charming and graceful words of which the young writer was justly proud

About this time occurred the death of her mother the first break in the
home and family circle In August of 1876 she made a visit to Concord
at the Emersons memorable enough for her to keep a journal and note
down every incident and detail Very touching to read now in its almost
childlike simplicity is this record of persons that pass and shadows
that remain Mr Emerson himself meets her at the station and drives
with her in his little onehorse wagon to his home the gray square
house with dark green blinds set amidst noble trees A glimpse of the
familythe stately whitehaired Mrs Emerson and the beautiful
faithful Ellen whose figure seems always to stand by the side of her
august father Then the picture of Concord itself lovely and smiling
with its quiet meadows quiet slopes and quietest of rivers She meets
the little set of Concord people Mr Alcott for whom she does not
share Mr Emersons enthusiasm and William Ellery Channing whose
figure stands out like a gnarled and twisted scruboaka pathetic
impossible creature whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on
account of an innate nobility of character Generally crabbed and
reticent with strangers he took a liking to me says Emma Lazarus
The bond of our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau whose memory he
actually worships having been his constant companion in his best
days and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroic
suffering I do not know whether I was most touched by the thought of
the unique lofty character that had inspired this depth and fervor of
friendship or by the pathetic constancy and pure affection of the poor
desolate old man before me who tried to conceal his tenderness and
sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness and philosophy He
never speaks of Thoreaus death she says but always Thoreaus
loss or when I lost Mr Thoreau or when Mr Thoreau went away from
Concord nor would he confess that he missed him for there was not a
day an hour a moment when he did not feel that his friend was still
with him and had never left him And yet a day or two after she goes
on to say when I sat with him in the sunlit wood looking at the
gorgeous blue and silver summer sky he turned to me and said Just
half of the world died for me when I lost Mr Thoreau None of it looks
the same as when I looked at it with him He took me through the
woods and pointed out to me every spot visited and described by his
friend Where the hut stood is a little pile of stones and a sign
Site of Thoreaus Hut and a few steps beyond is the pond with
thicklywooded shoreeverything exquisitely peaceful and beautiful in
the afternoon light and not a sound to be heard except the crickets or
the zing of the locusts which Thoreau has described Farther on he
pointed out to me in the distant landscape a low roof the only one
visible which was the roof of Thoreaus birthplace He had been over
there many times he said since he lost Mr Thoreau but had never gone
inhe was afraid it might look lonely But he had often sat on a
rock in front of the house and looked at it On parting from his young
friend Mr Channing gave her a package which proved to be a copy of
his own book on Thoreau and the pocket compass which Thoreau carried to
the Maine woods and on all his excursions Before leaving the Emersons
she received the proofsheets of her drama of The Spagnoletto which
was being printed for private circulation She showed them to Mr
Emerson who had expressed a wish to see them and after reading them
he gave them back to her with the comment that they were good She
playfully asked him if he would not give her a bigger word to take home
to the family He laughed and said he did not know of any but he
went on to tell her that he had taken it up not expecting to read it
through and had not been able to put it down Every word and line told
of richness in the poetry he said and as far as he could judge
the play had great dramatic opportunities Early in the autumn The
Spagnoletto appeareda tragedy in five acts the scene laid in Italy
1655

Without a doubt every one in these days will take up with misgiving
and like Mr Emerson not expecting to read it through a fiveact
tragedy of the seventeenth century so far removed apparently from the
age and present actualitiesso opposed to the Modernite which has
come to be the last word of art Moreover great names at once appear
great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous newcomer in this highest
realm of expression The Spagnoletto has grave defects that would
probably preclude its ever being represented on the stage The denoument
especially is unfortunate and sins against our moral and aesthetic
instinct The wretched tigerlike father stabs himself in the presence
of his crushed and erring daughter so that she may forever be haunted
by the horror and the retribution of his death We are left suspended
as it were over an abyss our moral judgment thwarted our humanity
outraged But The Spagnoletto is nevertheless a remarkable
production and pitched in another key from anything the writer has
yet given us Heretofore we have only had quiet reflective passive
emotion now we have a storm and sweep of passion for which we were
quite unprepared Riberas character is charged like a thundercloud
with dramatic elements Maria Rosa is the child of her father fired at
a flash deaf dumb and blind at the touch of passion


 Does love steal gently oer our soul

she asks


 What if he come
 A cloud a fire a whirlwind

and then the cry


 O my God
 This awful joy in mine own heart is love

Again


 While you are here the one thing real to me
 In all the universe is love


Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenesat the ball and in
the gardenbetween the dashing princelover in search of his pleasure
and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes on her lips in her
hand Behind them always like a tragic fate the somber figure of the
Spagnoletto and over all the glow and color and soul of Italy

In 1881 appeared the translation of Heines poems and ballads which was
generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatable poet Very
curious is the link between that bitter mocking cynic spirit and the
refined gentle spirit of Emma Lazarus Charmed by the magic of his
verse the iridescent play of his fancy and the sudden cry of the heart
piercing through it all she is as yet unaware or only vaguely conscious
of the of the real bond between them the sympathy in the blood
the deep tragic Judaic passion of eighteen hundred years that was
smouldering in her own heart soon to break out and change the whole
current of thought and feeling

Already in 1879 the storm was gathering In a distant province of
Russia at first then on the banks of the Volga and finally in Moscow
itself the old cry was raised the hideous mediaeval charge revived
and the standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews Province
after province took it up In Bulgaria Servia and above all
Roumania where we were told the sword of the Czar had been drawn to
protect the oppressed Christian atrocities took the place of Moslem
atrocities and history turned a page backward into the dark annals of
violence and crime And not alone in despotic Russia but in Germany
the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture the rage of
AntiSemitism broke out and spread with fatal ease and potency In
Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened We in America could
scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports and for a while
we shut our eyes and ears to the facts but we were soon rudely awakened
from our insensibility and forced to face the truth It was in England
that the voice was first raised in behalf of justice and humanity
In January 1881 there appeared in the London Times a series of
articles carefully compiled on the testimony of eyewitnesses and
confirmed by official documents records etc giving an account of
events that had been taking place in southern and western Russia during
a period of nine months between April and December of 1880 We do
not need to recall the sickening details The headings will suffice
outrage murder arson and pillage and the result100000 Jewish
families made homeless and destitute and nearly 100000000 worth of
property destroyed Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy
and indignation from America It is not that it is the oppression
of Jews by Russia said Mr Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall
Wednesday evening February 4 it is that it is the oppression of men
and women and we are men and women So spoke civilized Christendom
and for Judaismwho can describe that thrill of brotherhood quickened
anew the immortal pledge of the race made one again through sorrow
For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awoke slumbering and
unguessed echoes All this time she had been seeking heroic ideals in
alien stock soulless and far removed in pagan mythology and mystic
mediaeval Christianity ignoring her very birthrightthe majestic
vista of the past down which high above flood and fire had been
conveyed the precious scroll of the Moral Law Hitherto Judaism had been
a dead letter to her Of Portuguese descent her family had always been
members of the oldest and most orthodox congregation of New York where
strict adherence to custom and ceremonial was the watchword of faith
but it was only during her childhood and earliest years that she
attended the synagogue and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages
which she had now long since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing
on modern life Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people As
late as April 1882 she published in The Century Magazine an
article written probably some months before entitled Was the Earl of
Beaconsfield a Representative Jew in which she is disposed to accept
as the type of the modern Jew the brilliant successful but not
overscrupulous chevalier dindustrie In view of subsequent or rather
contemporaneous events the closing paragraph of the article in question
is worthy of being cited


 Thus far their religion the Jewish whose mere preservation
 under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle
 has been deprived of the natural means of development and
 progress and has remained a stationary force The next
 hundred years will in our opinion be the test of their
 vitality as a people the phase of toleration upon which
 they are only now entering will prove whether or not they
 are capable of growth


By a curious almost fateful juxtaposition in the same number of the
magazine appeared Madame Ragozins defense of Russian barbarity and in
the following May number Emma Lazaruss impassioned appeal and reply
Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism From this time dated the
crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race and the consequent
expansion of all her faculties the growth of spiritual power which
always ensues when a great cause is espoused and a strong conviction
enters the soul Her verse rang out as it had never rung beforea
clarion note calling a people to heroic action and unity to the
consciousness and fulfillment of a grand destiny When has Judaism been
so stirred as by The Crowing of the Red Cock and


 THE BANNER OF THE JEW

 Wake Israel wake Recall today
 The glorious Maccabean rage
 The sire heroic hoarygray
 His fivefold lionlineage
 The Wise the Elect the HelpofGod
 The BurstofSpring the Avenging Rod


 From Mizpehs mountain ridge they saw
 Jerusalems empty streets her shrine
 Laid waste where Greeks profaned the Law
 With idol and with pagan sign
 Mourners in tattered black were there
 With ashes sprinkled on their hair


 Then from the stony peak there rang
 A blast to ope the graves down poured
 The Maccabean clan who sang
 Their battle anthem to the Lord
 Five heroes lead and following see
 Ten thousand rush to victory


 Oh for Jerusalems trumpet now
 To blow a blast of shattering power
 To wake the sleeper high and low
 And rouse them to the urgent hour
 No hand for vengeance but to save
 A million naked swords should wave


 Oh deem not dead that martial fire
 Say not the mystic flame is spent
 With Moses law and Davids lyre
 Your ancient strength remains unbent
 Let but an Ezra rise anew
 To lift the BANNER OF THE JEW


 A rag a mock at firsterelong
 When men have bled and women wept
 To guard its precious folds from wrong
 Even they who shrunk even they who slept
 Shall leap to bless it and to save
 Strike for the brave revere the brave


The dead forms burst their bonds and lived again She sings Rosh
Hashanah the Jewish New Year and Hanuckah the Feast of Lights


 Kindle the taper like the steadfast star
 Ablaze on Evenings forehead oer the earth
 And add each night a lustre till afar
 An eightfold splendor shine above thy hearth
 Clash Israel the cymbals touch the lyre
 Blow the brass trumpet and the harshtongued horn
 Chant psalms of victory till the heart take fire
 The Maccabean spirit leap newborn


 And The New Ezekiel


 What can these dead bones live whose sap is dried
 By twenty scorching centuries of wrong
 Is this the House of Israel whose pride
 Is as a tale thats told an ancient song
 Are these ignoble relics all that live
 Of psalmist priest and prophet Can the breath
 Of very heaven bid these bones revive
 Open the graves and clothe the ribs of death
 Yea Prophesy the Lord hath said again
 Say to the wind come forth and breathe afresh
 Even that they may live upon these slain
 And bone to bone shall leap and flesh to flesh
 The spirit is not dead proclaim the word
 Where lay dead bones a host of armed men stand
 I ope your graves my people saith the Lord
 And I shall place you living in your land


Her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source She
threw herself into the study of her race its language literature and
history

Breaking the outward crust she pierced to the heart of the faith and
the miracle of its survival What was it other than the everpresent
evervivifying spirit itself which cannot diethe religious and
ethical zeal which fires the whole history of the people and of which
she herself felt the living glow within her own soul She had come upon
the secret and the genius of Judaismthat absolute interpenetration
and transfusion of spirit with body and substance which taken
literally often reduces itself to a question of food and drink a
dietary regulation and again in proper splendor incarnates itself
and shines out before humanity in the prophets teachers and saviors of
mankind

Those were busy fruitful years for Emma Lazarus who worked not with
the pen alone but in the field of practical and beneficent activity
For there was an immense task to accomplish The tide of immigration had
set in and ship after ship came laden with hunted human beings flying
from their fellowmen while all the time like a tocsin rang the
terrible story of cruelty and persecutionhorrors that the pen refuses
to dwell upon By the hundreds and thousands they flocked upon our
shoreshelpless innocent victims of injustice and oppression
panicstricken in the midst of strange and utterly new surroundings

Emma Lazarus came into personal contact with these people and visited
them in their refuge on Ward Island While under the influence of all
the emotions aroused by this great crisis in the history of her race
she wrote the Dance of Death a drama of persecution of the twelfth
century founded upon the authentic recordsunquestionably her finest
work in grasp and scope and above all in moral elevation and purport
The scene is laid in Nordhausen a free city in Thuringia where the
Jews living as the deemed in absolute security and peace were caught
up in the wave of persecution that swept over Europe at that time
Accused of poisoning the wells and causing the pestilence or black
death as it was called they were condemned to be burned

We do not here intend to enter upon a critical or literary analysis of
the play or to point out dramatic merits or defects but we should
like to make its readers feel with us the holy ardor and impulse of
the writer and the spiritual import of the work The action is without
surprise the doom fixed from the first but so glowing is the canvas
with local and historic color so vital and intense the movement so
resistless the internal evidence if we may call it thus penetrating
its very substance and form that we are swept along as by a wave of
human sympathy and grief In contrast with The Spagnoletto how large
is the theme and how allembracing the catastrophe In place of the
personal we have the drama of the universal Love is only a flash
nowa dream caught sight of and at once renounced at a higher claim


 Have you no smile to welcome love with Liebhaid
 Why should you tremble
 Prince I am afraid
 Afraid of my own heart my unfathomed joy
 A blasphemy against my fathers grief
 My peoples agony


 What good shall come forswearing kith and God
 To follow the allurements of the heart


asks the distracted maiden torn between her love for he princely wooer
and her devotion to the people among whom her lot has been cast


 O God
 How shall I pray for strength to love him less
 Than mine own soul
 No more of that
 I am all Israels now Till this cloud pass
 I have no thought no passion no desire
 Save for my people


Individuals perish but great ideas survivefortitude and courage
and that exalted loyalty and devotion to principle which alone are worth
living and dying for

The Jews pass by in processionmen women and childrenon their way
to the flames to the sound of music and in festal array carrying the
gold and silver vessels the roll of the law the perpetual lamp and the
seven branched silver candlestick of the synagogue The crowd hoot and
jeer at them


 The misers they will take their gems and gold
 Down to the grave


 Let us rejoice


sing the Jewish youths in chorus and the maidens


 Our feet stand within thy gates O Zion
 Within thy portals O Jerusalem


The flames rise and dart among them their garments wave their jewels
flash as they dance and sing in the crimson blaze The music ceases a
sound of crashing boards is heard and a great cryHallelujah What
a glory and consecration of the martyrdom Where shall we find a more
triumphant vindication and supreme victory of spirit over matter


 I see I see
 How Israels evercrescent glory makes
 These flames that would eclipse it dark as blots
 Of candlelight against the blazing sun
 We die a thousand deathsdrown bleed and burn
 Our ashes are dispersed unto the winds
 Yet the wild winds cherish the sacred seed
 The fire refuseth to consume

         

 Even as we die in honor from our death
 Shall bloom a myriad heroic lives
 Brave through our bright example virtuous
 Lest our great memory fall in disrepute


The Dance to Death was published along with other poems and
translations from the Hebrew poets of mediaeval Spain in a small column
entitled Songs of a Semite The tragedy was dedicated In profound
veneration and respect to the memory of George Eliot the illustrious
writer who did most among the artists of our day towards elevating and
ennobling the spirit of Jewish nationality

For this was the idea that had caught the imagination of Emma Lazarus
a restored and independent nationality and repatriation in Palestine
In her article in The Century of February 1883 on the Jewish
Problem she says


 I am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other
 than this are but temporary palliatives The idea
 formulated by George Eliot has already sunk into the minds
 of many Jewish enthusiasts and it germinates with miraculous
 rapidity The idea that I am possessed with says Deronda
 is that of restoring a political existence to my people
 making them a nation again giving them a national centre
 such as the English have though they too are scattered
 over the face of the globe That task which presents itself
 to me as a duty I am resolved to devote my life to
 it AT THE LEAST I MAY AWAKEN A MOVEMENT IN OTHER MINDS
 SUCH HAS BEEN AWAKENED IN MY OWN Could the noble
 prophetess who wrote the above words have lived but till
 today to see the everincreasing necessity of adopting her
 inspired counsel she would have been herself astonished
 at the flame enkindled by her seed of fire and the practical
 shape which the movement projected by her poetic vision is
 beginning to assume


In November of 1882 appeared her first Epistle to the Hebrewsone of
a series of articles written for the American Hebrew published weekly
through several months Addressing herself now to a Jewish audience
she sets forth without reserve her views and hopes for Judaism
now passionately holding up the mirror for the shortcomings and
peculiarities of her race She says


 Every student of the Hebrew language is aware that we have
 in the conjugation of our verbs a mode known as the intensive
 voice which by means of an almost imperceptible modification
 of vowelpoints intensifies the meaning of the primitive root
 A similar significance seems to attach to the Jews themselves
 in connection with the people among whom they dwell They are
 the intensive form of any nationality whose language and
 customs they adopt Influenced by the same causes they
 represent the same results but the deeper lights and shadows
 of the Oriental temperament throw their failings as well as
 their virtues into more prominent relief


In drawing the epistles to a close February 24 1883 she thus
summarizes the special objects she has had in view


 My chief aim has been to contribute my mite towards arousing
 that spirit of Jewish enthusiasm which might manifest itself
 First in a return to varied pursuits and broad system of
 physical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors
 Second in a more fraternal and practical movement towards
 alleviating the sufferings of oppressed Jews in countries less
 favored than our own Third in a closer and wider study of
 Hebrew literature and history and finally in a truer recognition
 of the large principals of religion liberty and law upon
 which Judaism is founded and which should draw into harmonious
 unity Jews of every shade of opinion


Her interest in Jewish affairs was at its height when she planned a
visit abroad which had been a longcherished dream and May 15
1883 she sailed for England accompanied by a younger sister We have
difficulty in recognizing the tragic priestess we have been portraying
in the enthusiastic child of travel who seems newborn into a new world
From the very outset she is in a maze of wonder and delight At sea she
writes


 Our last day on board ship was a vision of beauty from
 morning till nightthe sea like a mirror and the sky
 dazzling with light In the afternoon we passed a ship
 in full sail near enough to exchange salutes and cheers
 After tossing about for six days without seeing a human
 being except those on our vessel even this was a sensation
 Then an hour or two before sunset came the great sensation
 ofland At first nothing but a shadow on the far horizon
 like the ghost of a ship two or three widely scattered rocks
 which were the promontories of Ireland and sooner than we
 expected we were steaming along lowlying purple hills


The journey to Chester gives her the first glimpse of mellow
Englanda surprise which is yet no surprise so well known and
familiar does it appear Then Chester with its quaint picturesque
streets like the scene of a Walter Scott novel the cathedral planted
in greenness and the clear gray river where a boatful of scarlet
dragoons goes gliding by Everything is a picture for her special
benefit She drinks in at every sense the sights sounds and smells
and the unimaginable beauty of it all Then the bewilderment of London
and a whirl of people sights and impressions She was received with
great distinction by the Jews and many of the leading men among them
warmly advocated her views But it was not alone from her own people
that she met with exceptional consideration She had the privilege
of seeing many of the most eminent personages of the day all of whom
honored her with special and personal regard There was no doubt
something that strongly attracted people to her at this timethe force
of her intellect at once made itself felt while at the same time the
unaltered simplicity and modesty of her character and her readiness and
freshness of enthusiasm kept her still almost like a child

She makes a flying visit to Paris where she happens to be on the 14th
of July the anniversary of the storming of the Bastile and of the
beginning of the republic she drives to Versailles that gorgeous
shell of royalty where the crowd who celebrate the birth of the
republic wander freely through the halls and avenues and into the most
sacred rooms of the king There are ruins on every side in Paris
she says ruins of the Commune or the Siege or the Revolution it is
terribleit seems as if the city were seared with fire and blood

Such was Paris to her then and she hastens back to her beloved London
starting from there on the tour through England that has been mapped
out for her A Day in Surrey with William Morris published in The
Century Magazine describes her visit to Merton Abbey the old Norman
monastery converted into a model factory by the poethumanitarian
who himself received her as his guest conducted her all over the
picturesque building and garden and explained to her his views of art
and his aims for the people

She drives through Kent where the fields valleys and slopes are
garlanded with hops and ablaze with scarlet poppies Then Canterbury
Windsor and Oxford Stratford Warwick the valley of the Wye Wells
Exeter and Salisburycathedral after cathedral Back to London
and then north through York Durham and Edinburgh and on the 15th of
September she sails for home We have merely named the names for it is
impossible to convey an idea of the delight and importance of this trip
a crescendo of enjoyment as she herself calls it Long after in
strange dark hours of suffering these pictures of travel arose before
her vivid and tragic even in their hold and spell upon her

The winter of 188384 was not especially productive She wrote a few
reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the Jewish themes
which appeared in the American Hebrew but for the most part gave
herself up to quiet retrospect and enjoyment with her friends of the
life she had had a glimpse of and the experience she had storeda
restful happy period In August of the same year she was stricken with
a severe and dangerous malady from which she slowly recovered only to
go through a terrible ordeal and affliction Her fathers health which
had long been failing now broke down completely and the whole winter
was one long strain of acute anxiety which culminated in his death
in March 1885 The blow was a crushing one for Emma Truly the silver
cord was loosed and the golden bowl broken Life lost its meaning and
charm Her fathers sympathy and pride in her work had been her chief
incentive and ambition and had spurred her on when her own confidence
and spirit failed Never afterwards did she find complete and
spontaneous expression She decided to go abroad as the best means
of regaining composure and strength and sailed once more in May for
England where she was welcomed now by the friends she had made almost
as to another home She spent the summer very quietly at Richmondan
ideally beautiful spot in Yorkshire where she soon felt the beneficial
influence of her peaceful surroundings The very air seems to rest one
here she writes and inspired by the romantic loveliness of the place
she even composed the first few chapters of a novel begun with a good
deal of dash and vigor but soon abandoned for she was still struggling
with depression and gloom

I have neither ability energy nor purpose she writes It is
impossible to do anything so I am forced to set it aside for the
present whether to take it up again or not in the future remains to be
seen

In the autumn she goes on the Continent visiting the Hague which
completely fascinates her and where she feels stronger and more
cheerful than she has for many a day Then Paris which this time
amazes her with its splendor and magnificence All the ghosts of the
Revolution are somehow laid she writes and she spends six weeks
here enjoying to the full the gorgeous autumn weather the sights the
picture galleries the bookshops the whole brilliant panorama of the
life and early in December she starts for Italy

And now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment that
pure desire and delight of the eyes which are the prerogative of the
poetEmma Lazarus was a poet The beauty of the worldwhat a rapture
and intoxication it is and how it bursts upon her in the very land of
beauty where Dante and Petrarch trod A magic glow colours it all no
mere blues and greens anymore but a splendor of purple and scarlet
and emerald each tower castle and village shining like a jewel the
olive the fig and at your feet the roses growing in midDecember
A day in Pisa seems like a week so crowded is it with sensations and
unforgettable pictures Then a month in Florence which is still more
entrancing with its inexhaustible treasures of beauty and art and
finally Rome the climax of it all


 wiping out all other places and impressions and opening
 a whole new world of sensations I am wild with the
 excitement of this tremendous place I have been here a
 week and have seen the Vatican and the Capitoline Museums
 and the Sistine Chapel and St Peters besides the ruins
 on the streets and on the hills and the graves of Shelley
 and Keats

 It is all heartbreaking I dont only mean those beautiful
 graves overgrown with acanthus and violets but the mutilated
 arches and columns and dumb appealing fragments looming up in
 the glowing sunshine under the Roman blue sky


True to her old attractions it is pagan Rome that appeals to her most
strongly


 and the faraway past that seems so sad and strange and
 near I am even out of humor with pictures a bit of broken
 stone or a fragment of a basrelief or a Corinthian column
 standing out against this lapislazuli sky or a tremendous
 arch are the only things I can look at for the moment
 except the Sistine Chapel which is as gigantic as the rest
 and forces itself upon you with equal might


Already in February spring is in the air the almondtrees are in
bloom violets cover the grass and oh the divine the celestial the
unheardof beauty of it all It is almost a pang for her with its
strange mixture of longing and regret and delight and in the midst
of it she says I have to exert all my strength not to lose myself in
morbidness and depression

Early in March she leaves Rome consoled with the thought of returning
the following winter In June she was in England again and spent the
summer at Malvern Disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon
her for she was oppressed at times by a languor and heaviness amounting
almost to lethargy When she returned to London however in September
she felt quite well again and started for another tour in Holland
which she enjoyed as much as before She then settled in Paris to await
the time when she could return to Italy But she was attacked at once
with grave and alarming symptoms that betokened a fatal end to her
malady Entirely ignorant however of the danger that threatened her
she kept up courage and hope made plans for the journey and looked
forward to setting out at any moment But the weeks passed and the
months also slowly and gradually the hope faded The journey to Italy
must be given up she was not in condition to be brought home and she
reluctantly resigned herself to remain where she was and convalesce
as she confidently believed in the spring Once again came the analogy
which she herself pointed out now to Heine on his mattressgrave in
Paris She too the last time she went out dragged herself to the
Louvre to the feet of the Venus the goddess without arms who could
not help Only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed
to keep her alive She sunk to a very low ebb but as she herself
expressed it she seemed to have always one little window looking out
into life and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few
drives and to sit on the balcony of her apartment She came back to
life with a feverish sort of thirst and avidity No such cure for
pessimism she says as a severe illness the simplest pleasures are
enoughto breathe the air and see the sun

Many plans were made for leaving Paris but it was finally decided to
risk the ocean voyage and bring her home and accordingly she sailed
July 23rd arriving in New York on the last day of that month

She did not rally after this and now began her long agony full of
every kind of suffering mental and physical Only her intellect seemed
kindled anew and none but those who saw her during the last supreme
ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit before
its extinction Never did she appear so brilliant Wasted to a shadow
and between acute attacks of pain she talked about art poetry the
scenes of travel of which her brain was so full and the phases of her
own condition with an eloquence for which even those who knew her best
were quite unprepared Every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense
quickened as the strong deliveress approached and the ardent soul was
released from the frame that could no longer contain it

We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a
natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and so vitally
endowed thus cut off in its prime But for us it is not fitting to
question or repine but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that
we hold What is any life even the most rounded and complete but a
fragment and a hint What Emma Lazarus might have accomplished had she
been spared it is idle and even ungrateful to speculate What she did
accomplish has real and peculiar significance It is the privilege of
a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality
shall add lustre and value to what they achieve To be born a Jewess was
a distinction for Emma Lazarus and she in turn conferred distinction
upon her race To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle
magnetism to her influence Nowhere is there contradiction or
incongruity Her works bear the imprint of her character and her
character of her works the same directness and honesty the same limpid
purity of tone and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful
The vulgar the false and the ignobleshe scarcely comprehended them
while on every side she was open and ready to take in and respond to
whatever can adorn and enrich life Literature was no mere profession
for her which shut out other possibilities it was only a free wide
horizon and background for culture She was passionately devoted to
music which inspired some of her best poems and during the last years
of her life in hours of intense physical suffering she found relief
and consolation in listening to the strains of Bach and Beethoven When
she went abroad painting was revealed to her and she threw herself
with the same ardor and enthusiasm into the study of the great masters
her last work left unfinished was a critical analysis of the genius
and personality of Rembrandt

And now at the end we ask Has the grave really closed over all these
gifts Has that eager passionate striving ceased and is the rest
silence

Who knows But would we break if we could that repose that silence
and mystery and peace everlasting




EPOCHS

 The epochs of our life are not in the facts but in the
 silent thought by the wayside as we walkEmerson




 I Youth


 Sweet empty sky of June without a stain
 Faint grayblue dewy mists on faroff hills
 Warm yellow sunlight flooding mead and plain
 That each dark copse and hollow overfills
 The rippling laugh of unseen rainfed rills
 Weeds delicateflowered white and pink and gold
 A murmur and a singing manifold


 The gray austere old earth renews her youth
 With dewlines sunshine gossamer and haze
 How still she lies and dreams and veils the truth
 While all is fresh as in the early days
 What simple things be these the soul to raise
 To bounding joy and make young pulses beat
 With nameless pleasure finding life so sweet


 On such a golden morning forth there floats
 Between the soft earth and the softer sky
 In the warm air adust with glistening motes
 The mystic winged and flickering butterfly
 A human soul that hovers giddily
 Among the gardens of earths paradise
 Nor dreams of fairer fields or loftier skies




 II Regret


 Thin summer rain on grass and bush and hedge
 Reddening the road and deepening the green
 On wide blurred lawn and in closetangled sedge
 Veiling in gray the landscape stretched between
 These low broad meadows and the pale hills seen
 But dimly on the far horizons edge


 In these transparentclouded gentle skies
 Wherethrough the moist beams of the soft June sun
 Might any moment break no sorrow lies
 No note of grief in swollen brooks that run
 No hint of woe in this subdued calm tone
 Of all the prospect unto dreamy eyes


 Only a tender unnamed halfregret
 For the lost beauty of the gracious morn
 A yearning aspiration fainter yet
 For brighter suns in joyous days unborn
 Now while brief showers ruffle grass and corn
 And all the earth lies shadowed grave and wet


 Space for the happy soul to pause again
 From pure content of all unbroken bliss
 To dream the future void of grief and pain
 And muse upon the past in reveries
 More sweet for knowledge that the present is
 Not all complete with mist and clouds and rain




 III Longing


 Look westward oer the steaming rainwashed slopes
 Now satisfied with sunshine and behold
 Those lustrous clouds as glorious as our hopes
 Softened with feathery fleece of downy gold
 In all fantastic huddled shapes uprolled
 Floating like dreams and melting silently
 In the blue upper regions of pure sky


 The eye is filled with beauty and the heart
 Rejoiced with sense of life and peace renewed
 And yet at such an hour as this upstart
 Vague myriad longing restless unsubdued
 And causeless tears from melancholy mood
 Strange discontent with earths and natures best
 Desires and yearnings that may find no rest




 IV Storm


 Serene was morning with clear winnowed air
 But threatening soon the low blue mass of cloud
 Rose in the west with mutterings faint and rare
 At first but waxing frequent and more loud
 Thick sultry mists the distant hilltops shroud
 The sunshine dies athwart black skies of lead
 Flash noiselessly thin threads of lightning red


 Breathless the earth seems waiting some wild blow
 Dreaded but far too close to ward or shun
 Scared birds aloft fly aimless and below
 Naught stirs in fields whence light and life are gone
 Save floating leaves with wisps of straw and down
 Upon the heavy air neath blueblack skies
 Livid and yellow the green landscape lies


 And all the while the dreadful thunder breaks
 Within the hollow circle of the hills
 With gathering might that angry echoes wakes
 And earth and heaven with unused clamor fills
 Oerhead still flame those strange electric thrills
 A moment morebehold yon bolt struck home
 And over ruined fields the storm hath come




 V Surprise


 When the stunned soul can first lift tired eyes
 On her changed world of ruin waste and wrack
 Ah what a pang of aching sharp surprise
 Brings all sweet memories of the lost past back
 With wild selfpitying grief of one betrayed
 Duped in a land of dreams where Truth is dead


 Are these the heavens that she deemed were kind
 Is this the world that yesterday was fair
 What painted images of folk halfblind
 Be these who pass her by as vague as air
 What go they seeking there is naught to find
 Let them come nigh and hearken her despair


 A mocking lie is all she once believed
 And where her heart throbbed is a cold dead stone
 This is a doom we never preconceived
 Yet now she cannot fancy it undone
 Part of herself part of the whole hard scheme
 All else is but the shadow of a dream




 VI Grief


 There is a hungry longing in the soul
 A craving sense of emptiness and pain
 She may not satisfy nor yet control
 For all the teeming world looks void and vain
 No compensation in eternal spheres
 She knows the loneliness of all her years


 There is no comfort looking forth nor back
 The present gives the lie to all her past
 Will cruel time restore what she doth lack
 Why was no shadow of this doom forecast
 Ah she hath played with many a keenedged thing
 Naught is too small and soft to turn and sting


 In the unnatural glory of the hour
 Exalted over time and death and fate
 No earthly task appears beyond her power
 No possible endurance seemeth great
 She knows her misery and her majesty
 And recks not if she be to live or die




 VII Acceptance


 Yea she hath looked Truth grimly face to face
 And drained unto the lees the proffered cup
 This silence is not patience nor the grace
 Of recognition meekly offered up
 But mere acceptance fraught with keenest pain
 Seeing that all her struggles must be vain


 Her future clear and terrible outlies
 This burden to be borne through all her days
 This crown of thorns pressed down above her eyes
 This weight of trouble she may never raise
 No reconcilement doth she ask nor wait
 Knowing such things are she endures her fate


 No brave endeavor of the broken will
 To cling to such poor stays as will abide
 Although the waves be wild and angry still
 After the lapsing of the swollen tide
 No fear of further loss no hope of gain
 Naught but the apathy of weary pain




 VIII Loneliness


 All stupor of surprise hath passed away
 She sees with clearer vision than before
 A world far off of light and laughter gay
 Herself alone and lonely evermore
 Folk come and go and reach her in no wise
 Mere flitting phantoms to her heavy eyes


 All outward things that once seemed part of her
 Fall from her like the leaves in autumn shed
 She feels as one embalmed in spice and myrrh
 With the heart eaten out a long time dead
 Unchanged without the features and the form
 Within devoured by the thin red worm


 By her own prowess she must stand or fall
 This grief is to be conquered day by day
 Who could befriend her who could make this small
 Or her strength great she meets it as she may
 A weary struggle and a constant pain
 She dreams not they may ever cease nor wane




 IX Sympathy


 It comes not in such wise as she had deemed
 Else might she still have clung to her despair
 More tender grateful than she could have dreamed
 Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair
 And gentle words borne softly through the air
 Calming her weary sense and wildered mind
 By welcome dear communion with her kind


 Ah she forswore all words as empty lies
 What speech could help encourage or repair
 Yet when she meets these grave indulgent eyes
 Fulfilled with pity simplest words are fair
 Caressing meaningless that do not dare
 To compensate or mend but merely soothe
 With hopeful visions after bitter Truth


 One who through conquered trouble had grown wise
 To read the grief unspoken unexpressed
 The misery of the blank and heavy eyes
 Or through youths infinite compassion guessed
 The heavy burdensuch a one brought rest
 And bade her lay aside her doubts and fears
 While the hard pain dissolved in blessed tears




 X Patience


 The passion of despair is quelled at last
 The cruel sense of undeserved wrong
 The wild selfpity these are also past
 She knows not what may come but she is strong
 She feels she hath not aught to lose nor gain
 Her patience is the essence of all pain


 As one who sits beside a lapsing stream
 She sees the flow of changeless day by day
 Too sick and tired to think too sad to dream
 Nor cares how soon the waters slip away
 Nor where they lead at the wise Gods decree
 She will depart or bide indifferently


 There is deeper pathos in the mild
 And settled sorrow of the quiet eyes
 Than in the tumults of the anguish wild
 That made her curse all things beneath the skies
 No question no reproaches no complaint
 Hers is the holy calm of some meek saint




 XI Hope


 Her languid pulses thrill with sudden hope
 That will not be forgot nor cast aside
 And life in statelier vistas seems to ope
 Illimitably lofty long and wide
 What doth she know She is subdued and mild
 Quiet and docile as a weaned child


 If grief came in such unimagined wise
 How may joy dawn In what undreamedof hour
 May the light break with splendor of surprise
 Disclosing all the mercy and the power
 A baseless hope yet vivid keen and bright
 As the wild lightning in the starless night


 She knows not whence it came nor where it passed
 But it revealed in one brief flash of flame
 A heaven so high a world so rich and vast
 That full of meek contrition and mute shame
 In patient silence hopefully withdrawn
 She bows her head and bides the certain dawn




 XII Compensation


 T is not alone that black and yawning void
 That makes her heart ache with this hungry pain
 But the glad sense of life hath been destroyed
 The lost delight may never come again
 Yet myriad serious blessings with grave grace
 Arise on every side to fill their place


 For much abides in her so lonely life
 The dear companionship of her own kind
 Love where least looked for quiet after strife
 Whispers of promise upon every wind
 A quickened insight in awakened eyes
 For the new meaning of the earth and skies


 The nameless charm about all things hath died
 Subtle as aureole round a shadows head
 Cast on the dewy grass at morningtide
 Yet though the glory and the joy be fled
 T is much her own endurance to have weighed
 And wrestled with Gods angels unafraid




 XIII Faith


 She feels outwearied as though oer her head
 A storm of mighty billows broke and passed
 Whose hand upheld her Who her footsteps led
 To this green haven of sweet rest at last
 What strength was hers unreckoned and unknown
 What love sustained when she was most alone


 Unutterably pathetic her desire
 To reach with groping arms outstretched in prayer
 Something to cling to to uplift her higher
 From this low world of coward fear and care
 Above disaster that her will may be
 At one with Gods accepting his decree


 Though by no reasons she be justified
 Yet strangely brave in Evils very face
 She deems this want must needs be satisfied
 Though here all slips from out her weak embrace
 And in blind ecstasy of perfect faith
 With her own dream her prayer she answereth




 XIV Work


 Yet life is not a vision nor a prayer
 But stubborn work she may not shun her task
 After the first compassion none will spare
 Her portion and her work achieved to ask
 She pleads for respiteshe will come ere long
 When resting by the roadside she is strong


 Nay for the hurrying throng of passersby
 Will crush her with their onwardrolling stream
 Much must be done before the brief light die
 She may not loiter rapt in the vain dream
 With unused trembling hands and faltering feet
 She staggers forth her lot assigned to meet


 But when she fills her days with duties done
 Strange vigor comes she is restored to health
 New aims new interests rise with each new sun
 And life still holds for her unbounded wealth
 All that seemed hard and toilsome now proves small
 And naught may daunt hershe hath strength for all




 XV Victory


 How strange in some brief interval of rest
 Backward to look on her farstretching past
 To see how much is conquered and repressed
 How much is gained in victory at last
 The shadow is not liftedbut her faith
 Strong from lifes miracles now turns toward death


 Though much be dark where once rare splendor shone
 Yet the new light has touched high peaks unguessed
 In her gold mistbathed dawn and one by one
 New outlooks loom from many a mountain crest
 She breathes a loftier purer atmosphere
 And lifes entangled paths grow straight and clear


 Nor will Death prove an allunwelcome guest
 The struggle has been toilsome to this end
 Sleep will be sweet and after labor rest
 And all will be atoned with him to friend
 Much must be reconciled much justified
 And yet she feels she will be satisfied




 XVI Peace


 The calm outgoing of a long rich day
 Checkered with storm and sunshine gloom and light
 Now passing in pure cloudless skies away
 Withdrawing into silence of blank night
 Thick shadows settle on the landscape bright
 Like the weird cloud of death that falls apace
 On the still features of the passive face


 Soothing and gentle as a mothers kiss
 The touch that stopped the beating of the heart
 A look so blissfully serene as this
 Not all the joy of living could impart
 With dauntless faith and courage therewithal
 The Master found her ready at his call


 On such a golden evening forth there floats
 Between the grave earth and the glowing sky
 In the clear air unvexed with hazy motes
 The mysticwinged and flickering butterfly
 A human soul that drifts at liberty
 Ah who can tell to what strange paradise
 To what undreamedof fields and lofty skies






 HOW LONG


 How long and yet how long
 Our leaders will we hail from over seas
 Master and kings from feudal monarchies
 And mock their ancient song
 With echoes weak of foreign melodies


 That distant isle mistwreathed
 Mantled in unimaginable green
 Too long hath been our mistress and our queen
 Our fathers have bequeathed
 Too deep a love for her our hearts within


 She made the whole world ring
 With the brave exploits of her children strong
 And with the matchless music of her song
 Too late too late we cling
 To alien legends and their strains prolong


 This fresh young world I see
 With heroes cities legends of her own
 With a new race of men and overblown
 By winds from sea to sea
 Decked with the majesty of every zone


 I see the glittering tops
 Of snowpeaked mounts the widning vales expanse
 Large prairies where free herds of horses prance
 Exhaustless wealth of crops
 In vast magnificent extravagance


 These grand exuberant plains
 These stately rivers each with many a mouth
 The exquisite beauty of the softaired south
 The boundless seas of grains
 Luxuriant forests lush and splendid growth


 The distant sirensong
 Of the green island in the eastern sea
 Is not the lay for this new chivalry
 It is not free and strong
 To chant on prairies neath this brilliant sky


 The echo faints and fails
 It suiteth not upon this western plain
 Out voice or spirit we should stir again
 The wilderness and make the vales
 Resound unto a yet unheardof strain






 HEROES


 In rich Virginian woods
 The scarlet creeper reddens over graves
 Among the solemn trees enlooped with vines
 Heroic spirits haunt the solitudes
 The noble souls of half a million braves
 Amid the murmurous pines


 Ah who is left behind
 Earnest and eloquent sincere and strong
 To consecrate their memories with words
 Not all unmeet with fitting dirge and song
 To chant a requiem purer than the wind
 And sweeter than the birds


 Here though all seems at peace
 The placid measureless sky serenely fair
 The laughter of the breeze among the leaves
 The bars of sunlight slanting through the trees
 The reckless wildflowers blooming everywhere
 The grasses delicate sheaves


 Nathless each breeze that blows
 Each tree that trembles to its leafy head
 With nervous life revives within our mind
 Tender as flowers of May the thoughts of those
 Who lie beneath the living beauty dead
 Beneath the sunshine blind


 For brave dead soldiers these
 Blessings and tears of aching thankfulness
 Soft flowers for the graves in wreaths enwove
 The odorous lilac of dear memories
 The heroic blossoms of the wilderness
 And the rich rose of love


 But who has sung their praise
 Not less illustrious who are living yet
 Armies of heroes satisfied to pass
 Calmly serenely from the whole worlds gaze
 And cheerfully accept without regret
 Their old life as it was


 With all its petty pain
 Its irritating littleness and care
 They who have scaled the mountain with content
 Sublime descend to live upon the plain
 Steadfast as though they breathed the mountainair
 Still wheresoeer they went

 They who were brave to act
 And rich enough their action to forget
 Who having filled their day with chivalry
 Withdraw and keep their simpleness intact
 And all unconscious add more lustre yet
 Unto their victory


 On the broad Western plains
 Their patriarchal life they live anew
 Hunters as mighty as the men of old
 Or harvesting the plenteous yellow grains
 Gathering ripe vintage of dusk bunches blue
 Or working mines of gold


 Or toiling in the town
 Armed against hindrance weariness defeat
 With dauntless purpose not to serve or yield
 And calm defiant they struggle on
 As sturdy and as valiant in the street
 As in the camp and field


 And those condemned to live
 Maimed helpless lingering still through suffering years
 May they not envy now the restful sleep
 Of the dear fellowmartyrs they survive
 Not oer the dead but over these your tears
 O brothers ye may weep


 New England fields I see
 The lovely cultured landscape waving grain
 Wide haughty rivers and pale English skies
 And lo a farmer ploughing busily
 Who lifts a swart face looks upon the plain
 I see in his frank eyes


 The heros soul appear
 Thus in the common fields and streets they stand
 The light that on the past and distant gleams
 They cast upon the present and the near
 With antique virtues from some mystic land
 Of knightly deeds and dreams




ADMETUS

 To my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson


 He who could beard the lion in his lair
 To bind him for a girl and tame the boar
 And drive these beasts before his chariot
 Might wed Alcestis For her low brows sake
 Her hairs soft undulations of warm gold
 Her eyes clear color and pure virgin mouth
 Though many would draw bow or shiver spear
 Yet none dared meet the intolerable eye
 Or lipless tusk of lion or boar
 This heard Admetus King of Thessaly
 Whose broad fat pastures spread their ample fields
 Down to the sheer edge of Amphrysus stream
 Who laughed disdainful at the fathers pride
 That set such value on one milkfaced child


 One morning as he rode alone and passed
 Through the green twilight of Thessalian woods
 Between two pendulous branches interlocked
 As through an open casement he descried
 A goddess as he deemedin truth a maid
 On a low bank she fondled tenderly
 A favorite hound her floral face inclined
 above the glossy graceful animal
 That pressed his snout against her cheek and gazed
 Wistfully with his keen sagacious eyes
 One arm with lax embrace the neck enwreathed
 With polished roundness near the sleek gray skin
 Admetus fixed with wonder dare not pass
 Intrusive on her holy innocence
 And sacred girlhood but his fretful steed
 Snuffed the air and champed and pawed the ground
 And hearing this the maiden raised her head
 No let or hindrance then might stop the king
 Once having looked upon those supreme eyes
 The drooping boughs disparting forth he sped
 And then drew in his steed to ask the path
 Like a lost traveller in an alien land
 Although each rivercloven vale with streams
 Arrowy glancing to the blue Aegean
 Each hallowed mountain the abode of gods
 Pelion and Ossa fringed with haunted groves
 The height springcrowned of dedicate Olympus
 And pleasant sunfed vineyards were to him
 Familiar as his own face in the stream
 Nathless he paused and asked the maid what path
 Might lead him from the forest She replied
 But still he tarried and with sportsmans praise
 Admired the hound and stooped to stroke its head
 And asked her if she hunted Nay not she
 Her father Pelias hunted in these woods
 Where there was royal game He knew her now
 Alcestisand he left her with due thanks
 No goddess but a mortal to be won
 By such a simple feat as driving boars
 And lions to his chariot What was that
 To him who saw the boar of Calydon
 The sacred boar of Artemis at bay
 In the broad stagnant marsh and sent his darts
 In its tough quivering flank and saw its death
 Stung by sure arrows of Arcadian nymph


 To riverpastures of his flocks and herds
 Admetus rode where sweetbreathed cattle grazed
 Heifers and goats and kids and foolish sheep
 Dotted cool spacious meadows with bent heads
 And necks soft wool broken in yellow flakes
 Nibbling sharptoothed the rich thickgrowing blades
 One herdsman kept the innumerable droves
 A boy yet young as immortality
 In listless posture on a vinegrown rock
 Around him huddled kids and sheep that left
 The mothers udder for his nighest grass
 Which sprouted with fresh verdure where he sat
 And yet dull neighboring rustics never guessed
 A god had been among them till he went
 Although with him they acted as he willed
 Renouncing shepherds silly pranks and quips
 Because his very presence made them grave
 Amphryssius after their translucent stream
 They called him but Admetus knew his name
 Hyperion god of sun and song and silver speech
 Condemned to serve a mortal for his sin
 To Zeus in sending violent darts of death
 A raising hand irreverent against
 The oneeyed forgers of the thunderbolt
 For shepherds crook he held the living rod
 Of twisted serpents later Hermes wand
 Him sought the king discovering soon hard by
 Idle as one in nowise bound to time
 Watching the restless grasses blow and wave
 The sparkle of the sun upon the stream
 Regretting nothing living with the hour
 For him who had his light and song within
 Was naught that did not shine and all things sang
 Admetus prayed for his celestial aid
 To win Alcestis which the god vouchsafed
 Granting with smiles as grant all gods who smite
 With stern hand sparing not for piteousness
 But give their gifts in gladness


 Thus the king
 Led with loose rein the beasts as tame as kine
 And townsfolk thronged within the city streets
 As round a god and mothers showed their babes
 And maidens loved the crowned intrepid youth
 And men aloud worship though the very god
 Who wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh
 Divinely scornful of neglect or praise
 Then Pelias seeing this would be his son
 As he had vowed called for his wife and child
 With Anaxibia Alcestis came
 A warm flush spreading oer her eager face
 In looking on the rider of the woods
 And knowing him her suitor and the king


 Admetus won Alcestis thus to wife
 And these with mated hearts and mutual love
 Lived a life blameless beautiful the king
 Ordaining justice in the gates the queen
 With grateful offerings to the household gods
 Wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart
 One child she boreEumelusand he throve
 Yet none the less because they sacrificed
 The firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers
 Did trouble come for sickness seized the king
 Alcestis watched with manyhanded love
 But unavailing service for he lay
 With languid limbs despite his ancient strength
 Of sinew and his skill with spear and sword
 His mother came Clymene and with her
 His father Pheres his unconscious child
 They brought him while forlorn Alcestis sat
 Discouraged with the face of desolation
 The jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech
 And smite his vigorous frame with impotence
 And ruin with bitter ashes worms and dust
 The beauty of his crowned exalted head
 He knew her presencesoon he would not know
 Nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close
 Nor care if she were near him any more
 Exhausted with long vigils thus the queen
 Held hard and grievous thoughts till heavy sleep
 Possessed her weary sense and she dreamed
 And even in her dream her trouble lived
 For she was praying in a barren field
 To all the gods for help when came across
 The waste of air and land from distant skies
 A spiritual voice divinely clear
 Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilled
 Her aching heart with tremor of strange joy
 Arise Alcestis cast away white fear
 A god dwells with you seek and you shall find
 Then quiet satisfaction filled her soul
 Almost akin to gladness and she woke
 Weak as the dead Admetus lay there still
 But she superb with confidence arose
 And passed beyond the mourners curious eyes
 Seeking Amphryssius in the meadowlands
 She found him with the godlike mien of one
 Who roused awakens unto deeds divine
 I come Hyperion with incessant tears
 To crave the life of my dear lord the king
 Pity me for I see the future years
 Widowed and laden with disastrous days
 And ye the gods will miss him when the fires
 Upon your shrines unfed neglected die
 Who will pour large libations in your names
 And sacrifice with generous piety
 Silence and apathy will greet you there
 Where once a splendid spirit offered praise
 Grant me this boon divine and I will beat
 With prayer at mornings gates before they ope
 Unto thy silverhoofed and flameeyed steeds
 Answer ere yet the irremeable stream
 Be crossed answer O god and save
 She ceased
 With full throat salt with tears and looked on him
 And with a sudden cry of awe fell prone
 For lo he was transmuted to a god
 The supreme aureole radiant round his brow
 Divine refulgences on his facehis eyes
 Awful with splendor and his august head
 With blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame
 Then in a voice that charmed the listening air
 Woman arise I have no influence
 On Death who is the servant of the Fates
 Howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer
 The grace of thy fair womanhood and youth
 Thus godlike will I intercede for thee
 And sue the insatiate sisters for this life
 Yet hope not blindly loth are these to change
 Their purpose neither will they freely give
 But haggling lend or sell perchance the price
 Will counterveil the boon Consider this
 Now rise and look upon me And she rose
 But by her stood no godhead bathed in light
 But young Amphryssius herdsman to the king
 Benignly smiling
 Fleet as thought the god
 Fled from the glittering earth to blackest depths
 Of Tartarus and none might say he sped
 On wings ambrosial or with feet as swift
 As scouring hail or airy chariot
 Borne by the flamebreathing steeds ethereal
 But with a motion inconceivable
 Departed and was there Before the throne
 Of Ades first he hailed the longsought queen
 Stolen with violent hands from grassy fields
 And delicate airs of sunlit Sicily
 Pensive goldhaired but innocenteyed no more
 As when she laughing plucked the daffodils
 But grave as on fulfilling a strange doom
 And low at Ades feet wrapped in grim murk
 And darkness thick the three gray women sat
 Looserobed and chapleted with wool and flowers
 Purple narcissi round their horrid hair
 Intent upon her task the first one held
 The tender thread that at a touch would snap
 The second weaving it with warp and woof
 Into strange textures some stained dark and foul
 Some sanguinecolored and some black as night
 And rare ones white or with a golden thread
 Running throughout the web the farthest hag
 With glistening scissors cut her sisters work
 To these Hyperion but they never ceased
 Nor raised their eyes till with soft moderate tones
 But by their powerful persuasiveness
 Commanding all to listen and obey
 He spoke and all hell heard and these three looked
 And waited his request
 I come a god
 At pure mortal queens request who sues
 For life renewed unto her dying lord
 Admetus and I also pray this prayer
 Then cease for when hath Fate been moved by prayer
 But strength and upright heart should serve with you
 I ask ye not forever to forbear
 But spare a whilea moment unto us
 A lifetime unto men The Fates swerve not
 For supplications like the pliant gods
 Have they not willed a lifes thread should be cut
 With them the will is changeless as the deed
 O men ye have not learned in all the past
 Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit
 How long will ye besiege the thrones of gods
 With lamentations When lagged Death for all
 Your timorous shirking We work not like you
 Delaying and relenting purposeless
 With unenduring issues but our deeds
 Forever interchained and interlocked
 Complete each other and explain themselves
 Ye will a life then why not any life
 What care we for the king He is not worth
 These many words indeed we love not speech
 We care not if he live or lose such life
 As men are greedy forfilled full with hate
 Sins beneath scorn and only lit by dreams
 Or one sane moment or a useless hope
 Lasting how longthe space between the green
 And fading yellow of the grass they tread
 But he withdrawing not Will any life
 Suffice ye for Admetus Yea the crones
 Three times repeated We know no such names
 As king or queen or slave we want but life
 Begone and vex us in our work no more


 With broken blessings inarticulate joy
 And tears Alcestis thanked Hyperion
 And worshipped Then he gently Who will die
 So that the king may live And she You ask
 Nay who will live when life clasps hands with shame
 And death with honor Lo you are a god
 You cannot know the highest joy of life
 To leave it when t is worthier to die
 His parents kinsmen courtiers subjects slaves
 For love of him myself would die were none
 Found ready but what Greek would stand to see
 A woman glorified and falter Once
 And only once the gods will do this thing
 In all the ages such a man themselves
 Delight to honorholy temperate chaste
 With reverence for his daemon and his god
 Thus she triumphant to they very door
 Of King Admetus chamber All there saw
 Her illtimed gladness with much wonderment
 But she No longer mourn The king is saved
 The Fates will spare him Lift your voice in praise
 Sing paeans to Apollo crown your brows
 With laurel offer thankful sacrifice
 O Queen what mean these foolish words misplaced
 And what an hour is this to thank the Fates
 Thrice blessed be the godsfor God himself
 Has sued for methey are not stern and deaf
 Cry and they answer commune with your soul
 And they send counsel weep with rainy grief
 And these will sweeten you your bitterest tears
 On one condition King Admetus lives
 And ye on hearing will lament no more
 Each emulous to save Thenfor she spake
 Assured as having heard an oracle
 They asked What deed of ours may serve the king
 The Fates accept another life for his
 And one of you may die Smiling she ceased
 But silence answered her What do ye thrust
 Your arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks
 Dying like Greeks too proud to own the pang
 This ask I not In all the populous land
 But one need suffer for immortal praise
 The generous Fates have sent no pestilence
 Famine nor war it is as though they gave
 Freely and only make the boon more rich
 By such slight payment Now a people mourns
 And ye may change the grief to jubilee
 Filling the cities with a pleasant sound
 But as for me what faltering words can tell
 My joy in extreme sharpness kin to pain
 A monument you have within my heart
 Wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances
 And I will pray for you before I crave
 Pardon and pity for myself from God
 Your name will be the highest in the land
 Oftenest fondest on my grateful lips
 After the name of him you die to save
 What silent still Since when has virtue grown
 Less beautiful than indolence and ease
 Is death more terrible more hateworthy
 More bitter than dishonor Will ye live
 On shame Chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits
 What sons will ye bring forthmeansouled like you
 Or like your parents braveto blush like girls
 And sayOur fathers were afraid to die
 Ye will not dare to raise heroic eyes
 Unto the eyes of aliens In the streets
 Will women and young children point at you
 Scornfully and the sun will find you shamed
 And night refuse to shield you What a life
 Is this ye spin and fashion for yourselves
 And what new tortures of suspense and doubt
 Will death invent for such as are afraid
 Acastus thou my brother in the field
 Foremost who greeted me with sanguine hands
 From ruddy battle with a conquerors face
 These honors wilt thou blot with infamy
 Nay thou hast won no honors a mere girl
 Would do as much as thou at such a time
 In clamorous battlemidst tumultuous sounds
 Neighing of warsteeds shouts of sharp command
 Snapping of shivered spears for all are brave
 When all men look to them expectantly
 But he is truly brave who faces death
 Within his chamber at a sudden call
 At night when no man seescontent to die
 When life can serve no longer those he loves
 Then thus Acastus Sister I fear not
 Death nor the empty darkness of the grave
 And hold my life but as a little thing
 Subject unto my peoples call and Fate
 But if t is little no greater is the kings
 And though my heart bleeds sorely I recall
 Astydamia who thus would mourn for me
 We are not cowards we youth of Thessaly
 And Thessalyyea all Greeceknoweth it
 Nor will we brook the name from even you
 Albeit a queen and uttering these wild words
 Through your umwonted sorrow Then she knew
 That he stood firm and turning from him cried
 To the kings parents Are ye deaf with grief
 Pheres Clymene Ye can save your son
 Yet rather stand and weep with barren tears
 O shame to think that such gray reverend hairs
 Should cover such unvenerable heads
 What would ye losea remnant of mere life
 A few slight raveled threads and give him years
 To fill with glory Who when he is gone
 Will call you gentlest names this side of heaven
 Father and mother Knew ye not this man
 Ere he was royala poor helpless child
 Crownless and kingdomless One birth alone
 Sufficeth not Clymene once again
 You must give life with travail and strong pain
 Has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes
 What mother can refuse a second birth
 To such a son But ye denying him
 What afteroffering may appease the gods
 What joy outweigh the grief of this one day
 What clamor drown the hours myriad tongues
 Crying Your son your son where is your son
 Unnatural mother timid foolish man
 Then Pheres gravely These are graceless words
 From you our daughter Life is always life
 And death comes soon enough to such as we
 We twain are old and weak have served our time
 And made our sacrifices Let the young
 Arise now in their turn and save the king
 O gods look on your creatures do ye see
 And seeing have ye patience Smite them all
 Unsparing with dishonorable death
 Vile slaves a woman teaches you to die
 Intrepid with exalted steadfast soul
 Scorn in my heart and love unutterable
 I yield the Fates my life and like a god
 Command them to revere that sacred head
 Thus kiss I thrice the dear blind holy eyes
 And bid them see and thrice I kiss this brow
 And thus unfasten I the pale proud lips
 With fruitful kissings bringing love and life
 And without fear or any pang I breathe
 My soul in him
 Alcestis I awake
 I hear I hearunspeak thy reckless words
 For lo thy lifeblood tingles in my veins
 And streameth through my body like new wine
 Behold thy spirit dedicate revives
 My pulse and through thy sacrifice I breathe
 Thy lips are bloodless kiss me not again
 Ashen thy cheeks faded thy flowerlike hands
 O woman perfect in thy womanhood
 And in thy wifehood I adjure thee now
 As mother by the love thou bearest our child
 In this thy hour of passion and of love
 Of sacrifice and sorrow to unsay
 Thy words sublime I die that thou mayest live
 And deemest thou that I accept the boon
 Craven like these my subjects Lo my queen
 Is life itself a lovely thingbare life
 And empty breath a thing desirable
 Or is it rather happiness and love
 That make it precious to its inmost core
 When these are lost are there not swords in Greece
 And flame and poison deadly waves and plagues
 No man has ever lacked these things and gone
 Unsatisfied It is not these the gods refuse
 Nay never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip
 Not these I seek but I will stab myself
 Poison my life and burn my flesh with words
 And save or follow thee Lo hearken now
 I bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts
 O spurn them and I scorn them and I hate
 Will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers
 With tongue reviling blasphemous I curse
 With mouth polluted from deliberate heart
 Dishonored be their names scorned be their priests
 Ruined their altars mocked their oracles
 It is Admetus King of Thessaly
 Defaming thus annihilate him gods
 So that his queen who worships you may live
 He paused as one expectant but no bolt
 From the insulted heavens answered him
 But awful silence followed Then a hand
 A boyish hand upon his shoulder fell
 And turning he beheld his shepherd boy
 Not wrathful but divinely pitiful
 Who spake in tender thrilling tones The gods
 Cannot recall their gifts Blaspheme them not
 Bow down and worship rather Shall he curse
 Who sees not and who hears notneither knows
 Nor understands Nay thou shalt bless and pray
 Pray for the pure heart purged by prayer divines
 And seeth when the bolder eyes are blind
 Worship and wonderthese befit a man
 At every hour and mayhap will the gods
 Yet work a miracle for knees that bend
 And hands that supplicate
 Then all they knew
 A sudden sense of awe and bowed their heads
 Beneath the striplings gaze Admetus fell
 Crushed by that gentle touch and cried aloud
 Pardon and pity I am hard beset




 ______________________




 There waited at the doorway of the king
 One grim and ghastly shadowy horrible
 Bearing the likeness of a king himself
 Erect as one who serveth notupon
 His head a crown within his fleshless hands
 A sceptremonstrous winged intolerable
 To him a stranger coming neath the trees
 Which slid down flakes of light now on his hair
 Closecurled now on his bared and brawny chest
 Now on his flexile vinelike veined limbs
 With iron network of strong muscle thewed
 And godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed
 Firm was his step no superfluity
 Of indolent flesh impeded this mans strength
 Slender and supple every perfect limb
 Beautiful with the glory of a man
 No weapons bare he neither shield his hands
 Folded upon his breast his movements free
 Of all incumbrance When his mighty strides
 Had brought him nigh the waiting one he paused
 Whose palace this and who art thou grim shade
 The palace of the King of Thessaly
 And my name is not strange unto thine ears
 For who hath told men that I wait for them
 The one sure thing on earth Yet all they know
 Unasking and yet answered I am Death
 The only secret that the gods reveal
 But who are thou who darest question me
 Alcides and that thing I dare not do
 Hath found no name Whom here awaitest thou
 Alcestis Queen of Thessalya queen
 Who wooed me as the bridegroom woos the bride
 For her life sacrificed will save her lord
 Admetus as the Fates decreed I wait
 Impatient eager and I enter soon
 With darkening wing invisible a god
 And kiss her lips and kiss her throbbing heart
 And then the tenderest hands can do no more
 Than close her eyes and wipe her cold white brow
 Inurn her ashes and strew flowers above
 This woman is a god a hero Death
 In this her sacrifice I see a soul
 Luminous starry earth can spare her not
 It is not rich enough in purity
 To lose this paragon Save her O Death
 Thou surely art more gentle than the Fates
 Yet these have spared her lord and never meant
 That she should suffer and that this their grace
 Beautiful royal on one side should turn
 Sudden and show a fearful fatal face
 Nay have they not O fond and foolish man
 Naught comes unlooked for unforeseen by them
 Doubt when they favor thee though thou mayest laugh
 When they have scourged thee with an iron scourge
 Behold their smile is deadlier than their sting
 And every boon of theirs is doublefaced
 Yea I am gentler unto ye than these
 I slay relentless but when have I mocked
 With poisoned gifts and generous hands that smite
 Under the flowers for my name is Truth
 Were this fair queen more fair more pure more chaste
 I would not spare her for your wildest prayer
 Nor her best virtue Is the earths mouth full
 Is the grave satisfied Discrown me then
 For life is lord and men may mock the gods
 With immortality I sue no more
 But I command thee spare this womans life
 Or wrestle with Alcides Wrestle with thee
 Thou puny boy And Death laughed loud and swelled
 To monstrous bulk fierceeyed with outstretched wings
 And lightnings round his brow but grave and firm
 Strong as a tower Alcides waited him
 And these began to wrestle and a cloud
 Impenetrable fell and all was dark

 Farewell Admetus and my little son
 EumelusO these clinging baby hands
 Thy loss is bitter for no chance no fame
 No wealth of love can ever compensate
 for a dead mother Thou O king fulfill
 The double duty love him with my love
 And make him bold to wrestle shiver spears
 Noble and manly Grecian to the bone
 And tell him that his mother spake with gods
 Farewell farewell Mine eyes are growing blind
 The darkness gathers O my heart my heart
 No sound made answer save the cries of grief
 From all the mourners and the suppliance
 Of strickn Admetus O have mercy gods
 O gods have mercy mercy upon us
 Then from the dying womans couch again
 Her voice was heard but with strange sudden tones
 Lo I awakethe light comes back to me
 What miracle is this And thunders shook
 The air and clouds of mighty darkness fell
 And the earth trembled and weird horrid sounds
 Were heard of rushing wings and fleeing feet
 And groans and all were silent dumb with awe
 Saving the king who paused not in his prayer
 Have mercy gods and then again O gods
 Have mercy


 Through the open casement poured
 Bright floods of sunny light the air was soft
 Clear delicate as though a summer storm
 Had passed away and those there standing saw
 Afar upon the plain Death fleeing thence
 And at the doorway weary wellnigh spent
 Alcides flushed with victory




TANNHAUSER

 To my mother May 1870


 The Landgrave Hermann held a gathering
 Of minstrels minnesingers troubadours
 At Wartburg in his palace and the knight
 Sir Tannhauser of France the greatest bard
 Inspired with heavenly visions and endowed
 With apprehension and rare utterance
 Of noble music fared in thoughtful wise
 Across the Horsel meadows Full of light
 And large repose the peaceful valley lay
 In the late splendor of the afternoon
 And level sunbeams lit the serious face
 Of the young knight who journeyed to the west
 Towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs
 Scarred grim and torn with savage rifts and chasms
 That in the distance loomed as soft and fair
 And purple as their shadows on the grass
 The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air
 Proclaiming sunset ushering evening in
 Although the sky yet glowed with yellow light
 The ploughboy ere he led his cattle home
 In the near meadow reverently knelt
 And doffed his cap and duly crossed his breast
 Whispering his Ave Mary as he heard
 The pealing vesperbell But still the knight
 Unmindful of the sacred hour announced
 Disdainful or unconscious held his course
 Would that I also like yon stupid wight
 Could kneel and hail the Virgin and believe
 He murmured bitterly beneath his breath
 Were I a pagan riding to contend
 For the Olympic wreath O with what zeal
 What fire of inspiration would I sing
 The praises of the gods How may my lyre
 Glorify these whose very life I doubt
 The world is governed by one cruel God
 Who brings a sword not peace A pallid Christ
 Unnatural perfect and a virgin cold
 They give us for a heaven of living gods
 Beautiful loving whose mere names were song
 A creed of suffering and despair walled in
 On every side by brazen boundaries
 That limit the souls vision and her hope
 To a red hell or and unpeopled heaven
 Yea I am lost alreadyeven now
 Am doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts
 O gods O gods where shall my soul find peace
 He raised his wan face to the faded skies
 Now shadowing into twilight no response
 Came from their sunless heights no miracle
 As in the ancient days of answering gods
 With a long shuddering sigh he glanced to earth
 Finding himself among the Horsel cliffs
 Gray sullen gaunt they towered on either side
 Scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the rifts
 Of their huge crags and made small darker spots
 Upon their wrinkled sides the jaded horse
 Stumbled upon loose rattling fallen stones
 Amidst the gathering dusk and blindly fared
 Through the weird perilous pass As darkness waxed
 And an oppressive mystery enwrapped
 The roadstead and the rocks Sir Tannhauser
 Fancied he saw upon the mountainside
 The fluttering of white raiment With a sense
 Of wild joy and horror he gave pause
 For his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat
 Trembling in every limb confirmed his thought
 That nothing human scaled that haunted cliff
 The white thing seemed descendingnow a cloud
 It looked and now a rag of drifted mist
 Torn in the jagged gorge precipitous
 And now an apparition clad in white
 Shapely and realthen he lost it quite
 Gazing on nothing with blank foolish face
 As with wide eyes he stood he was aware
 Of a strange splendor at his very side
 A presence and a majesty so great
 That ere he saw he felt it was divine
 He turned and leaping from his horse fell prone
 In speechless adoration on the earth
 Before the matchless goddess who appeared
 With no less freshness of immortal youth
 Than when first risen from foam of Paphian seas
 He heard delicious strains of melody
 Such as his highest muse had neer attained
 Float in the air while in the distance rang
 Harsh and discordant jarring with those tones
 The gallop of his frightened horses hoofs
 Clattering in sudden freedom down the pass
 A voice that made all music dissonance
 Then thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight
 Triumphantly The gods need but appear
 And their usurped thrones are theirs again
 Then tenderly Sweet knight I pray thee rise
 Worship me not for I desire thy love
 Look on me follow me for I am fain
 Of thy fair human face He rose and looked
 Stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul
 Her hair unbraided and unfilleted
 Rained in a glittering shower to the ground
 And cast forth lustre Round her zone was clasped
 The scintillant cestus stiff with flaming gold
 Thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars
 She might have flung the enchanted wonder forth
 Her eyes her slightest gesture would suffice
 To bind all men in blissful slavery
 She sprang upon the mountains dangerous side
 With feet that left their print in flowers divine
 Flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth
 Impurpled amaranth and asphodel
 Dewy with nectar and exhaling scents
 Richer than all the roses of midJune
 The knight sped after her with wild eyes fixed
 Upon her brightness as she lightly leapt
 From crag to crag with flying auburn hair
 Like a gold cloud that lured him ever on
 Higher and higher up the haunted cliff
 At last amidst a grove of pines she paused
 Until he reached her breathing hard with haste
 Delight and wonder Then upon his hand
 She placed her own and all his blood at once
 Tingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek
 At the supreme caress but the mere touch
 Infused fresh life and when she looked at him
 With gracious tenderness he felt himself
 Strong suddenly to bear the blinding light
 Of those great eyes Dear knight she murmured low
 For love of me wilt thou accord this boon
 To grace my weary home in banishment
 His hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke
 In tones abrupt that startled his own ears
 With their strange harshness but with thanks profuse
 She guided him still holding his cold hand
 In her warm dainty palm unto a cave
 Whence a rare glory issued and a smell
 Of spice and roses frankincense and balm
 They entering stood within a marble hall
 With straight slim pillars at whose farther end
 The goddess led him to a spiral flight
 Of stairs descending always midst black gloom
 Into the very bowels of the earth
 Down these with fearful swiftness they made way
 The knights feet touching not the solid stair
 But sliding down as in a vexing dream
 Blind feeling but that hand divine that still
 Empowered him to walk on empty air
 Then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze
 In vast palace filled with reveling folk
 Cunningly pictured on the ivory walls
 Were rolling hills cool lakes and boscage green
 And all the summer landscapes various pomp
 The precious canopy aloft was carved
 In semblance of the pleached forest trees
 Enameled with the liveliest green wherethrough
 A light pierced more resplendent than the day
 Oer the pale polished jasper of the floor
 Of burnished metal fretted and embossed
 With all the marvelous story of her birth
 Painted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts
 And carved by heavenly artistscrystal seas
 And longhaired Nereids in their pearly shells
 And all the wonder of her lucent limbs
 Sphered in a vermeil mist Upon the throne
 She took her seat the knight beside her still
 Singing on couches of fresh asphodel
 And the dance ceased and the flushed revelers came
 In glittering phalanx to adore their queen
 Beautiful girls with shining delicate heads
 Crested with living jewels fanned the air
 With flickering wings from naked shoulders soft
 Then with preluding low a thousand harps
 And citherns and strange nameless instruments
 Sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies
 And the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds
 With changing lustres like a summer sea
 Fair boys with charming yellow hair crispcurled
 And frail effeminate beauty the knight saw
 But of strong stalwart men like him were none
 He gazed thereon bewitched until the hand
 Of Venus erst withdrawn now fell again
 Upon his own and roused him from his trance
 He looked on her and as he looked a cloud
 Auroral flaming as at sunrising
 Arose from nothing floating over them
 In luminous folds like that vermilion mist
 Penciled upon the throne and as it waxed
 In density and brightness all the throng
 Of festal dancers less and less distinct
 Grew like pale spirits in a vague dim dream
 And vanished altogether and these twain
 Shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud
 Now with a glory inconceivable
 Vivid and conflagrant looked each on each


 All hours came laden with their own delights
 In that enchanted place wherein Time
 Knew no divisions harsh of night and day
 But light was always and desire of sleep
 Was satisfied at once with slumber soft
 Desire of food with magical repast
 By unseen hands on golden tables spread
 But these the knight accepted like a god
 All less was lost in that excess of joy
 The crowning marvel of her love for him
 Assuring him of his divinity
 Meanwhile remembrance of the earth appeared
 Like the vague trouble of a transient dream
 The doubt the scruples the remorse for thoughts
 Beyond his own control the constant thirst
 For something fairer than his life more real
 Than airy revelations of his Muse
 Here was his souls desire satisfied
 All nobler passions died his lyre he flung
 Recklessly forth with vows to dedicate
 His being to herself She knew and seized
 The moment of her mastery and conveyed
 The lyre beyond his sight and memory
 With blandishment divine she changed for him
 Each hour her mood a very woman now
 Fantastic voluble affectionate
 And jealous of the vague unbodied air
 Exacting penitent and pacified
 All in a breath And often she appeared
 Majestic with celestial wrath with eyes
 That shot forth fire and a heavy brow
 Portentous as the lowering front of heaven
 When the reverberant sullen thunder rolls
 Among the echoing clouds Thus she denounced
 Her ancient fickle worshippers who left
 Her altars desecrate her fires unfed
 Her name forgotten But I reign I reign
 She would shrill forth triumphant yea I reign
 Men name me not but worship me unnamed
 Beauty and Love within their heart of hearts
 Not with bent knees and empty breath of words
 But with devoted sacrifice of lives
 Then melting in a moment she would weep
 Ambrosial tears pathetic full of guile
 Accusing her own base ingratitude
 In craving worship when she had his heart
 Her priceless knight her peerless paladin
 Her Tannhauser then with an artful glance
 Of lovely helplessness entreated him
 Not to desert her like the faithless world
 For these unbeautiful and barbarous gods
 Or she would never cease her prayers to Jove
 Until he took from her the heavy curse
 Of immortality With closer vows
 The knight then sealed his worship and forswore
 All other aims and deeds to serve her cause
 Thus passed unnoted seven barren years
 Of reckless passion and voluptuous sloth
 Undignified by any lofty thought
 In his degraded mind that sometime was
 Endowed with noble capability
 From revelry to revelry he passed
 Craving more pungent pleasure momently
 And new intoxications and each hour
 The siren goddess answered his desires
 Once when she left him with a weary sense
 Of utter lassitude he sat alone
 And raising listless eyes he saw himself
 In a great burnished mirror wrought about
 With cunning imagery of twisted vines
 He scarcely knew those sunken redrimmed eyes
 For his who in the flush of manhood rode
 Among the cliffs and followed up the crags
 The flying temptress and there fell on him
 A horror of her beauty a disgust
 For his degenerate and corrupted life
 With irresistible intense desire
 To feel the breath of heaven on his face
 Then as Fate willed who rules above the gods
 He saw within the glass behind him glide
 The form of Venus Certain of her power
 She had laid by in fond security
 The enchanted cestus and Sir Tannhauser
 With surfeited regard beheld her now
 No fairer than the women of the earth
 Whom with serenity and health he left
 Duped by a lovely witch Before he moved
 She knew her destiny and when he turned
 He seemed to drop a mask disclosing thus
 An alien face and eyes with vision true
 That for long time with glamour had been blind
 Hiding the hideous rage within her breast
 With girlish simpleness of folded hands
 Auroral blushes and sweet shamefast mien
 She spoke Behold my love I have cast forth
 All magic blandishments and sorcery
 For I have dreamed a dream so terrible
 That I awoke to find my pillow stained
 With tears as of real woe I thought my belt
 By Vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power
 Was the sole bond between us this being doffed
 I seemed to thee an old unlovely crone
 Wrinkled by every year that I have seen
 Thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer
 So that I woke with weeping Then I rose
 And drew the glittering girdle from my zone
 Jealous thereof yet full of fears and said
 If it be this he loves then let him go
 I have no solace as a mortal hath
 No hope of change or death to comfort me
 Through all eternity yet he is free
 Though I could hold him fast with heavy chains
 Bound in perpetual imprisonment
 Tell me my vision was a baseless dream
 See I am kneeling and kiss thy hands
 In pity look on me before thy word
 Condemns me to immortal misery
 As she looked down the infernal influence
 Worked on his soul again for she was fair
 Beyond imagination and her brow
 Seemed luminous with high selfsacrifice
 He bent and kissed her head warm shining soft
 With its closecurling gold and love revived

 But ere he spoke he heard the distant sound
 Of one sweet smitten lyre and a gleam
 Of violent anger flashed across the face
 Upraised to his in feigned simplicity
 And singleness of purpose Then he sprang
 Wellnigh a god himself with sudden strength
 to vanquish and resist beyond her reach
 Crying My old Muse calls me and I hear
 Thy fateful vision is no baseless dream
 I will be gone from this accursed hall
 Then she too rose dilating over him
 And sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs
 Unto her girdle and her head appeared
 Refulgent and her voice rang wrathfully
 Have I cajoled and flattered thee till now
 To lose thee thus How wilt thou make escape
 ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE
 Yea not my love but my poor slave and fool
 But he with both hands pressed upon his eyes
 Against that blinding lustre heeded not
 Her thundered words and cried in sharp despair
 Help me O Virgin Mary and thereat
 The very bases of the hall gave way
 The roof was rived the goddess disappeared
 And Tannhauser stood free upon the cliff
 Amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air


 Around him were the tumbled blocks and crags
 Huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks
 Black caves and masses of the grim bald rock
 The ethereal unfathomable sky
 Hung over him the valley lay beneath
 Dotted with yellow hayricks that exhaled
 Sweet healthy odors to the mountaintop
 He breathed intoxicate the infinite air
 And plucked the heather blossoms where they blew
 Reckless with light and dew in crannies green
 And scarcely saw their darling bells for tears
 No sounds of labor reached him from the farms
 And hamlets trim nor from the furrowed glebe
 But a serene and sabbath stillness reigned
 Till broken by the faint melodious chimes
 Of the small village church that called to prayer
 He hurried down the rugged scarped cliff
 And swung himself from shelving granite slopes
 To narrow footholds near widethroated chasms
 Tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands
 With long hair flying from his dripping brow
 Uncovered head and white exalted face
 No memory had he of his smooth ascent
 No thought of fear upon those dreadful hills
 He only heard the bell inviting him
 To satisfy the craving of his heart
 For worship midst his fellow men He reached
 The beaten dusty road and passed thereon
 The pious peasants faring towards the church
 And scarce refrained from greeting them like friends
 Dearly beloved after long absence met
 How more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked
 In their rough homespun gowns and coifs demure
 After the beauty of bare rosy limbs
 And odorous loose hair He noted not
 Suspicious glances on his garb uncouth
 His air extravagant and face distraught
 With bursts of laughter from the redcheeked boys
 And prudent crossings of the womens breasts
 He passed the flowering close about the church
 And trod the well wornpath with throbbing heart
 The little heatherbell between his lips
 And his eyes fastened on the good green grass
 Thus entered he the sanctuary lit
 With frequent tapers and with sunbeams stained
 Through painted glass How pure and innocent
 The waiting congregation seemed to him
 Kneeling or seated with calm brows upraised
 With faltering strength he cowered down alone
 And held sincere communion with the Lord
 For one brief moment in a sudden gush
 Of blessed tears The minister of God
 Rose to invoke a blessing on his flock
 And then began the servicenot in words
 To raise the lowly and to heal the sick
 But an alien tongue with phrases formed
 And meaningless observances The knight
 Unmoved yet thirsting for the simple word
 That might have moved him held his bitter thoughts
 But when in his own speech a new priest spake
 Looked up with hope revived and heard the text
 Go preach the Gospel unto all the world
 He that believes and is baptized is saved
 He that believeth not is damned in hell
 He sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes
 The crowded congregation disappeared
 He felt alone in some black sea of hell
 While a great light smote one exalted face
 Vivid already with prophetic fire
 Whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom
 He longed in that void circle to cry out
 With one clear shriek but sense and voice seemed bound
 And his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth
 As the last words resounded through the church
 And once again the pastor blessed his flock
 Who serious and subdued passed slowly down
 The arrow aisle none noted near the wall
 A fallen man with face upon his knees
 A heap of huddled garments and loose hair
 Unconscious mid the rustling murmurous stir
 Midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers
 Let in athwart the doorway One lone priest
 Darkening the altar lights moved noiselessly
 Now with the yellow glow upon his face
 Now a black shadow gliding farther on
 Amidst the smooth slim pillars of hewn ash
 But from the vacant aisles he heard at once
 A hollow sigh heaved from a depth profound
 Upholding his last light above his head
 And peering eagerly amidst the stalls
 He cried Be blest who cometh in Gods name
 Then the gaunt form of Tannhauser arose
 Father I am a sinner and I seek
 Forgiveness and help by whatso means
 I can regain the joy of peace with God
 The Lord hath mercy on the penitent
 Although thy sins be scarlet He hath said
 Will I not make them white as wool Confess
 And I will shrive you Thus the good priest moved
 Towards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand
 But shrinking down he drew his fingers back
 From the kind palm and kissed the friars feet
 Thy pure hand is anointed and can heal
 The cool calm pressure brings back sanity
 And what serene past joys yet touch me not
 My contact is pollutionhear O hear
 While I disburden my charged soul He lay
 Casting about for words and strength to speak
 O father is there help for such a one
 In tones of deep abasement he began
 Who hath rebelled against the laws of God
 With pride no less presumptuous than his
 Who lost thereby his rank in heaven My son
 There is atonement for all sinsor slight
 Or difficult proportioned to the crime
 Though this may be the staining of thy hands
 With blood of kinsmen or of fellowmen
 My hands are whitemy crime hath found no name
 This side of hell yet though my heartstrings snap
 To live it over let me make the attempt
 I was a knight and bard with such a gift
 Of revelation that no hour of life
 Lacked beauty and adornment in myself
 The seat and centre of all happiness
 What inspiration could my lofty Muse
 Draw from those common and familiar themes
 Painted upon the windows and the walls
 Of every churchthe mother and her child
 The miracle and mystery of the birth
 The death the resurrection Fool and blind
 That saw not symbols of eternal truth
 In that grand tragedy and victory
 Significant and infinite as life
 What tortures did my skeptic soul endure
 At war against herself and all mankind
 The restless nights of feverish sleeplessness
 With balancing of reasons nicely weighed
 The dawn that brought no hope nor energy
 The blasphemous arraignment of the Lord
 Taxing His glorious divinity
 With all the grief and folly of the world
 Then came relapses into abject fear
 And hollow prayer and praise from craven heart
 Before a sculptured Venus I would kneel
 Crown her with flowers worship her and cry
 O large and noble type of our ideal
 At least my heart and prayer return to thee
 Amidst a faithless world of proselytes
 Madonna Mary with her virgin lips
 And eyes that look perpetual reproach
 Insults and is a blasphemy on youth
 Is she to claim the worship of a man
 Hot with the first rich flush of ripened life
 Realities like phantoms glided by
 Unnoted midst the torment and delights
 Of my conflicting spirit and I doffed
 the modest Christian weeds of charity
 And fit humility and steeled myself
 In pagan panoply of stoicism
 And selfsufficing pride Yet constantly
 I gained mens charmed attention and applause
 With the wild strains I smote from out my lyre
 To me the native language of my soul
 To them attractive and miraculous
 As all things whose solution and whose source
 Remain a mystery Then came suddenly
 The summons to attend the gathering
 Of minstrels at the Landgrave Hermanns court
 Resolved to publish there my pagan creed
 In harmonies so high and beautiful
 That all the world would share my zeal and faith
 I journeyed towards the haunted Horsel cliffs
 O God how may I tell you how SHE came
 The temptress of a hundred centuries
 Yet fresh as April She bewitched my sense
 Poisoned my judgment with sweet flatteries
 And for I may not guess how many years
 Held me a captive in degrading bonds
 There is no sin of lust so lewd and foul
 Which I learned not in that alluring hell
 Until this morn I snapped the ignoble tie
 By calling on the Mother of our Lord
 O for the power to stand again erect
 And look men in the eyes What penitence
 What scourging of the flesh what rigid fasts
 What terrible privations may suffice
 To cleanse me in the sight of God and man
 Illomened silence followed his appeal
 Patient and motionless he lay awhile
 Then sprang unto his feet with sudden force
 Confronting in his breathless vehemence
 With palpitating heart the timid priest
 Answer me as you hope for a response
 One day at the great judgment seat yourself
 I cannot answer said the timid priest
 I have not understood Just God is this
 The curse Thou layest upon me I outstrip
 The sympathy and brotherhood of men
 So far removed is my experience
 From their clean innocence Inspire me
 Prompt me to words that bring me near to them
 Father in gentler accents he resumed
 Thank Heaven at your every orison
 That sin like mine you cannot apprehend
 More than the truth perchance I have confessed
 But I have sinned and darklythis is true
 And I have suffered and am suffering now
 Is there no help in your great Christian creed
 Of liberal charity for such a one
 My son the priest replied your speech distraught
 Hath quite bewildered me I fain would hope
 That Christs large charity can reach your sin
 But I know naught I cannot but believe
 That the enchantress who first tempted you
 Must be the Evil oneyour early doubt
 Was the possession of your soul by him
 Travel across the mountain to the town
 The first cathedral town upon the road
 That leads to Romea sage and reverend priest
 The Bishop Adrian bides there Say you have come
 From his leal servant Friar Lodovick
 He hath vast lore and great authority
 And may absolve you freely of your sin


 Over the rolling hills through summer fields
 By noisy villages and lonely lanes
 Through glowing days when all the landscape stretched
 Shimmering in the heat a pilgrim fared
 Towards the cathedral town Sir Tannhauser
 Had donned the mournful sackcloth girt his loins
 With a coarse rope that ate into his flesh
 Muffled a cowl about his shaven head
 Hung a great leaden cross around his neck
 And bearing in his hands a knotty staff
 With swollen sandaled feet he held his course
 He snatched scant rest at twilight or at dawn
 When his forced travel was least difficult
 But most he journeyed when the sky oercast
 Uprolled its threatening clouds of dusky blue
 And angry thunder grumbled through the hills
 And earth grew dark at noonday till the flash
 Of the thin lightning through the wide sky leapt
 And tumbling showers scoured along the plain
 Then folk who saw the pilgrim penitent
 Drenched weird and hastening as as to some strange doom
 Swore that the wandering Jew had crossed their land
 And the Lord Christ had sent the deadly bolt
 Harmless upon his cursed immortal head
 At length the hillside citys spires and roofs
 With all its western windows smitten red
 By a rich sunset and with massive towers
 Of its cathedral overtopping all
 greeted his sight Some weary paces more
 And as the twilight deepened in the streets
 He stood within the minster How serene
 In sculptured calm of centuries it seemed
 How cool and spacious all the dimlit aisles
 Still hazy with fumes of frankincense
 The vesper had been said yet here and there
 A wrinkled beldam or mourner veiled
 Or burly burgher on the cold floor knelt
 And still the organist with wandering hands
 Drew from the keys mysterious melodies
 And filled the church with flying waifs of song
 That with ethereal beauty moved the soul
 To a more tender prayer and gentler faith
 Than choral anthems and the solemn mass
 A thousand memories sweet to bitterness
 Rushed on the knight and filled his eyes with tears
 Youths blamelessness and faith forever lost
 The love of his neglected lyre his art
 Revived by these aerial harmonies
 He was unworthy now to touch the strings
 Too base to stir mens soul to ecstasy
 And high resolves as in the days agone
 And yet with all his spirits earnestness
 He yearned to feel the lyre between his hands
 To utter all the trouble of his life
 Unto the Muse who understands and helps
 Outworn with travel soothed to drowsiness
 By dying music and sweetscented air
 His limbs relaxed and sleep possessed his frame
 Auroral light the eastern oriels touched
 When with delicious sense of rest he woke
 Amidst the cast and silent empty aisles
 Gods peace hath fallen upon me in this place
 This is my Bethel here I feel again
 A holy calm if not of innocence
 Yet purest after that the calm serene
 Of expiation and forgiveness
 He spake and passed with staff and wallet forth
 Through the tall portal to the open square
 And turning paused to look upon the pile
 The northern front against the crystal sky
 Loomed dark and heavy full of sombre shade
 With each projecting buttress carven cross
 Gable and mullion tipped with laughing light
 By the slant sunbeams of the risen morn
 The noisy swallows wheeled above their nests
 Builded in hidden nooks about the porch
 No human life was stirring in the square
 Save now and then a rumbling marketteam
 Fresh from the fields and farms without the town
 He knelt upon the broad cathedral steps
 And kissed the moistened stone while overhead
 The circling swallows sang and all around
 The mighty city lay asleep and still


 To strangers ears must yet again be made
 The terrible confession yet again
 A deathly chill with something worse than fear
 Seized the knights heart who knew his every word
 Widened the gulf between his kind and him
 The Bishop sat with pomp of mitred head
 In pride of proven virtue hearkening to all
 With cold official apathy nor made
 A sign of pity nor encouragement
 The friar understood the pilgrims grief
 The language of his eyes his speech alone
 Was alien to these kind untutored ears
 But this was truly to be misconstrued
 To tear each palpitating word alive
 From out the depths of his remorseful soul
 And have it weighed with the precision cool
 And the nice logic of a reasoning mind
 This spiritual Father judged his crime
 As the mad mischief of a reckless boy
 That call for strict immediate punishment
 But Tannhauser who felt himself a man
 Though base yet fallen through passions and rare gifts
 Of an exuberant nature rankly rich
 And knew his weary head was growing gray
 With a lifes terrible experience
 Found his old sense of proper worth revive
 But modestly he ended Yet I felt
 O holy Father in the church this morn
 A strange security a peace serene
 As though een yet the Lord regarded me
 With merciful compassion yea as though
 Even so vile a worm as I might work
 Mine own salvation through repentant prayers
 Presumptuous man it is no easy task
 To expiate such sin a space of prayer
 That deprecates the anger of the Lord
 A pilgrimage through pleasant summer lands
 May not atone for years of impious lust
 Thy heart hath lied to thee in offering hope
 Is there no hope on earth the pilgrim sighed
 None through thy penance said the saintly man
 Yet there may be through mediation help
 There is a man who by a blameless life
 Hath won the right to intercede with God
 No sins of his own flesh hath he to purge
 The Cardinal Filippohe abides
 Within the Holy City Seek him out
 This is my only counselthrough thyself
 Can be no help and no forgiveness


 How different from the buoyant joy of morn
 Was this discouraged sense of lassitude
 The Bishops words were ringing in his ears
 Measured and pitiless and blent with these
 The memory of the goddess last wild cry
 ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE
 Was it the truth despite his penitence
 And the dedication of his thought to God
 That still some portion of himself was hers
 Some lust survived some criminal regret
 For her corrupted love He searched his heart
 All was remorse religious and sincere
 And yet her dreadful curse still haunted him
 For all men shunned him and denied him help
 Knowing at once in looking on his face
 Ploughed with deep lines and prematurely old
 That he had struggled with some deadly fiend
 And that he was no longer kin to them
 Just past the outskirts of the town he stopped
 To strengthen will and courage to proceed
 The storm had broken oer the sultry streets
 But now the lessening clouds were flying east
 And though the gentle shower still wet his face
 The west was cloudless while the sun went down
 And the bright sevencolored arch stood forth
 Against the opposite dull gray There was
 A beauty in the mingled storm and peace
 Beyond clear sunshine as the vast green fields
 Basked in soft light though glistening yet with rain
 The roar of all the town was now a buzz
 Less than the insects drowsy murmuring
 That whirred their gauzy wings around his head
 The breeze that follows on the sunsetting
 Was blowing whiffs of bruised and dripping grass
 Into the heated city But he stood
 Disconsolate with thoughts of fate and sin
 Still wrestling with his soul to win it back
 From her who claimed it to eternity
 Then on the delicate air there came to him
 The intonation of the minster bells
 Chiming the vespers musical and faint
 He knew not what of dear and beautiful
 There was in those familiar peals that spake
 Of his first boyhood and his innocence
 Leading him back with gracious influence
 To pleasant thoughts and tender memories
 And last recalling the fair hour of hope
 He passed that morning in the church Again
 The glad assurance of Gods boundless love
 Filled all his being and he rose serene
 And journeyed forward with a calm content


 Southward he wended and the landscape took
 A warmer tone the sky a richer light
 The gardens of the graceful festooned with hops
 With their slight tendrils binding pole to pole
 Gave place to orchards and the trellised grape
 The hedges were enwreathed with trailing vines
 With clustering shapely bunches midst the growth
 Of tangled greenery The elm and ash
 Less frequent grew than cactus cypresses
 And goldenfruited or largeblossomed trees
 The far hills took the hue of the doves breast
 Veiled in gray mist of olive groves No more
 He passed dark moated strongholds of grim knights
 But terraces with marblepaven steps
 With fountains leaping in the sunny air
 And hanging gardens full of sumptuous bloom
 Then cloisters guarded by their dead gray walls
 Where now and then a golden globe of fruit
 Or fullflushed flower peered out upon the road
 Nodding against the stone and where he heard
 Sometimes the voices of the chanting monks
 Sometimes the laugh of children at their play
 Amidst the quaint old gardens But these sights
 Were in the suburbs of the wealthy towns
 For many a day through wildernesses rank
 Or marshy feverous meadowlands he fared
 The fierce sun smiting his closemuffled head
 Or midst the Alpine gorges faced the storm
 That drave adown the gullies melted snow
 And clattering boulders from the mountaintops
 At times between the mountains and the sea
 Fair prospects opened with the boundless stretch
 Of restless tideless water by his side
 And their long wash upon the yellow sand
 Beneath this generous sky the countryfolk
 Could lead a freer lifethe fat green fields
 Offered rich pasturage athwart the air
 Rang tinkling cowbells and the shepherds pipes
 The knight met many a strolling troubadour
 Bearing his cithern flute or dulcimer
 And oft beneath some castles balcony
 At night he heard their mellow voices rise
 Blent with stringed instruments or tambourines
 Chanting some lay as natural as a birds
 Then Nature stole with healthy influence
 Into his thoughts his love of beauty woke
 His Muse inspired dreams as in the past
 But after this came crueler remorse
 And he would tighten round his loins the rope
 And lie for hours beside some wayside cross
 And feel himself unworthy to enjoy
 The splendid gift and privilege of life
 Then forth he hurried spurred by his desire
 To reach the City of the Seven Hills
 And gain his absolution Some leagues more
 Would bring him to the vast Campagna land
 When by a roadside well he paused to rest
 T was noon and reapers in the field hard by
 Lay neath the trees upon the sunscorched grass
 But from their midst one came towards the well
 Not trudging like a man forespent with toil
 But frisking like a child at holiday
 With light steps The pilgrim watched him come
 And found him scarcely older than a child
 A largemouthed earthen pitcher in his hand
 And a guitar upon his shoulder slung
 A wide straw hat threw all his face in shade
 But doffing this to catch whatever breeze
 Might stir among the branches he disclosed
 A charming head of rippled auburn hair
 A frank fair face as lovely as a girls
 With great soft eyes as mild and grave as kines
 Above his head he slipped the instrument
 And laid it with his hat upon the turf
 Lowered his pitcher down the wellhead cool
 And drew it dripping upward ere he saw
 The watchful pilgrim craving as he thought
 The precious draught Your pardon holy sir
 Drink first he cried before I take the jar
 Unto my father in the reapingfield
 Touched by the cordial kindness of the lad
 The pilgrim answeredThanks my thirst is quenched
 From mine own palm The stranger deftly poised
 The brimming pitcher on his head and turned
 Back to the reapingfolk while Tannhauser
 Looked after him across the sunny fields
 Clasping each hand about his waist to bear
 The balanced pitcher then down glancing found
 The lads guitar near by and fell at once
 To striking its tuned string with wandering hands
 And pensive eyes filled full of tender dreams
 Yea holy sir it is a worthless thing
 And yet I love it for I make it speak
 The boy again stood by him and dispelled
 His train of fantasies half sweet half sad
 That was not in my thought the knight replied
 Its worth is more than rubies whoso hath
 The art to make this speak is raised thereby
 Above all loneliness or grief or fear
 More to himself than to the lad he spake
 Who understanding not stood doubtfully
 At a loss for answer but the knight went on
 How came it in your hands and who hath tuned
 your voice to follow it I am unskilled
 Good father but my mother smote its strings
 To music rare Diverted from one theme
 Pleased with the winsome candor of the boy
 The knight encouraged him to confidence
 Then his own gift of minstrelsy revealed
 And told bright tales of his first wanderings
 When in lords castles and kings palaces
 Men still made place for him for in his land
 The gift was rare and valued at its worth
 And brought great victory and sounding fame
 Thus in retracing all his pleasant youth
 His suffering passed as though it had not been
 Wideeyed and openmouthed the boy gave ear
 His fair face flushing with the sudden thoughts
 That went and camethen as the pilgrim ceased
 Drew breath and spake And where now is your lyre
 The knight with both hands hid his changed white face
 Crying aloud Lost lost forever lost
 Then gathering strength he bared his face again
 Unto the frightened wondering boy and rose
 With hasty fear Ah child you bring me back
 Unwitting to remembrance of my grief
 For which I donned eternal garb of woe
 And yet I owe you thanks for one sweet hour
 Of healthy human intercourse and peace
 T is not for me to tarry by the way
 Farewell The impetuous remorseful boy
 Seeing sharp pain on that kind countenance
 Fell at his feet and cried Forgive my words
 Witless but innocent and leave me not
 Without a blessing Moved unutterably
 The pilgrim kissed with trembling lips his head
 And muttered At this moment would to God
 That I were worthy Then waved wasted hands
 Over the youth in act of blessing him
 But faltered Cleanse me through his innocence
 O heavenly Father and with quickening steps
 Hastened away upon the road to Rome
 The noon was past the reapers drew broad swaths
 With scythes sunsmitten midst the ripened crop
 Thin shadows of the afternoon slept soft
 On the green meadows as the knight passed forth


 He trudged amidst the sea of poisonous flowers
 On the Campagnas undulating plain
 With Rome the manysteepled manytowered
 Before him regnant on her throne of hills
 A thick blue cloud of haze oerhung the town
 But the fastsinking sun struck fiery light
 From shining crosses roofs and flashing domes
 Across his path an arching bridge of stone
 Was raised above a shrunken yellow stream
 Hurrying with the light on every wave
 Towards the great town and outward to the sea
 Upon the bridges crest he paused and leaned
 Against the barrier throwing back his cowl
 And gazed upon the dull unlovely flood
 That was the Tiber Quaggy banks lay bare
 Muddy and miry glittering in the sun
 And myriad insects hovered oer the reeds
 Whose lithe moist tips by listless airs were stirred
 When the low sun had dropped behind the hills
 He found himself within the streets of Rome
 Walking as in a sleep where naught seemed real
 The chattering hubbub of the marketplace
 Was over now but voices smote his ear
 Of garrulous citizens who jostled past
 Loud cries gay laughter snatches of sweet song
 The tinkling fountains set in gardens cool
 About the pillared palaces and blent
 With trickling of the conduits in the squares
 The noisy teams within the narrow streets
 All these the stranger heard and did not hear
 While ringing bells pealed out above the town
 And calm gray twilight skies stretched over it
 Wide open stood the doors of every church
 And through the porches pressed a streaming throng
 Vague wonderment perplexed him at the sight
 Of broken columns raised to Jupiter
 Beside the cross immense cathedrals reared
 Upon a dead faiths ruins all the whirl
 And eager bustle of the living town
 Filling the storied streets whose very stones
 Were solemn monuments and spake of death
 Although he wrestled with himself the thought
 Of that poor past religion smote his heart
 With a huge pity and deep sympathy
 Beyond the fervor which the Church inspired
 Where was the noble race who ruled the world
 Moulded of purest elements and stuffed
 With sternest virtues every man a king
 Wearing the purple native in his heart
 These lounging beggars stealthy monks and priests
 And womanish patricians filled their place
 Thus Tannhauser still half an infidel
 Pagan through mind and Christian through the heart
 Fared thoughtfully with wandering aimless steps
 Till in the dying glimmer of the day
 He raised his eyes and found himself alone
 Amid the ruined arches broken shafts
 And huge arena of the Coliseum
 He did not see it as it was dimlit
 By something less than day and more than night
 With wan reflections of the rising moon
 Rather divined than seen on ivied walls
 And crumbled battlements and topless columns
 But by the light of all the ancient days
 Ringed with keen eager faces living eyes
 Fixed on the circus with a savage joy
 Where brandished swords flashed white and human blood
 Streamed oer the thirsty dust and Death was king
 He started shuddering and drew breath to see
 The foul pit choked with weeds and tumbled stones
 The cross raised midmost and the peaceful moon
 Shining oer all and fell upon his knees
 Restored to faith in one wise loving God
 Day followed day and still he bode in Rome
 Waiting his audience with the Cardinal
 And from the gates on pretext frivolous
 Passed daily forthhis Eminency slept
 Again his Eminency was fatigued
 By tedious sessions of the Papal court
 And thus the patient pilgrim was referred
 Unto a later hour At last the page
 Bore him a missive with Filippos seal
 That in his name commended Tannhauser
 Unto the Pope The worn discouraged knight
 Read the brief scroll then sadly forth again
 Along the bosky alleys of the park
 Passed to the glare and noise of summer streets
 Good God he muttered Thou hast ears for all
 And sendest help and comfort yet these men
 Thy saintly ministers must deck themselves
 With arrogance and from their large delight
 In all the beauty of the beauteous earth
 And peace of indolent untempted souls
 Deny the hungry outcast a bare word
 Yet even as he nourished bitter thoughts
 He felt a depth of clear serenity
 Unruffled in his heart beneath it all
 No outward object now had farther power
 To wound him there for the brooding oer those deeps
 Of vast contrition was boundless hope


 Yet not to leave a human chance untried
 He sought the absolution of the Pope
 In a great hall with airy galleries
 Thronged with high dignitaries of the Church
 He took his seat amidst the humblest friars
 Through open windows came sweet garden smells
 Bright morning light and twittered song of birds
 Around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems
 And splendid wealth of colorwhitestoled priests
 And scarlet cardinals and bishops clad
 In violet vestmentswhile beneath the shade
 Of the high gallery huddled dusky shapes
 With faded traveltattered sombre smocks
 And shaven heads and girdles of coarse hemp
 Some pilgrims penitent like Tannhauser
 Some devotees to kiss the sacred feet
 The brassy blare of trumpets smote the air
 Shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came
 And through the doorways widestretched tapestries
 Passed the Popes trumpeters and macebearers
 His vergers bearing slender silver wands
 Then mitred bishops redclad cardinals
 The stalwart Papal Guard with halberds raised
 And then with white head crowned with gold ingemmed
 The vicar of the lowly Galilean
 Holding his pastoral rod of smoothhewn wood
 With censer swung before and peacock fans
 Waved constantly by pages either side
 Attended thus they bore him to his throne
 And priests and laymen fell upon their knees
 Then after pause of brief and silent prayer
 The pilgrims singly through the hall defiled
 To kiss the borders of the papal skirts
 Smiting their foreheads on the paven stone
 Some silent abject some accusing them
 Of venial sins in accents of remorse
 Craving his grace and passing pardoned forth
 Sir Tannhauser came last no need for him
 To cry Peccavi and crook suppliant knees
 His gray head rather crushed than bowed his face
 Livid and wasted his deep thoughtful eyes
 His tall gaunt form in those unseemly weeds
 Spake more than eloquence His hollow voice
 Brake silence saying I am Tannhauser
 For seven years I lived apart from men
 Within the Venusberg A horror seized
 The assembled folk some turbulently rose
 Some clamored From the presence cast him forth
 But the knight never ceased his steady gaze
 Upon the Pope At lastI have not spoken
 To be condemned he said by such as these
 Thou spiritual Father answer me
 Look thou upon me with the eyes of Christ
 Can I through expiation gain my shrift
 And work mine own redemption Insolent man
 Thundered the outraged Pope is this the tone
 Wherewith thou dost parade thy loathsome sin
 Down on thy knees and wallow on the earth
 Nay rather go there is no ray of hope
 No gleam through cycles of eternity
 For the redemption of a soul like thine
 Yea sooner shall my pastoral rod branch forth
 In leaf and blossom and green shoots of spring
 Than Christ will pardon thee And as he spoke
 He struck the rod upon the floor with force
 That gave it entrance twixt two loosened tiles
 So that it stood fastrooted and alone
 The knight saw naught he only heard his judge
 Ring forth his curses and the court cry out
 Anathema and loud and blent therewith
 Derisive laughter in the very hall
 And a wild voice that thrilled through flesh and heart
 ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE
 Halfmad he clasped both hands upon his brow
 Amidst the storm of voices till they died
 And all was silence save the reckless song
 Of a young bird upon a twig without
 Then a defiant ghastly face he raised
 And shrieked T is false I am no longer thine
 And through the windows open to the park
 Rushed forth beyond the sight and sound of men


 By church nor palace paused he till he passed
 All squares and streets and crossed the bridge of stone
 And stood alone amidst the broad expanse
 Of the Campagna twinkling in the heat
 He knelt upon a knoll of turf and snapped
 The cord that held the cross about his neck
 And far from him the leaden burden flung
 O God I thank Thee that my faith in Thee
 Subsists at last through all discouragements
 Between us must no type nor symbol stand
 No mediator were he more divine
 Than the incarnate Christ All forms all priests
 I part aside and hold communion free
 Beneath the empty sky of noon with naught
 Between my nothingness and thy high heavens
 Spirit with spirit O have mercy God
 Cleanse me from lust and bitterness and pride
 Have mercy in accordance with my faith
 Long time he lay upon the scorching grass
 With his face buried in the tangled weeds
 Ah who can tell the struggles of his soul
 Against its demons in that sacred hour
 The solitude the anguish the remorse
 When shadows long and thin lay on the ground
 Shivering with fever helpless he arose
 But with a face divine ineffable
 Such as we dream the face of Israel
 When the Lords wrestling angel at gray dawn
 Blessed him and disappeared
 Upon the marsh
 All night he wandered striving to emerge
 From the wild pathless plainnow limitless
 And colorless beneath the risen moon
 Outstretching like a sea with landmarks none
 Save broken aqueducts and parapets
 And ruined columns glinting neath the moon
 His dress was dank and clinging with the dew
 A thousand insects fluttered oer his head
 With buzz and drone unseen cicadas chirped
 Among the long rank grass and far and near
 The fireflies flickered through the summer air
 Vague thoughts and gleams prophetic filled his brain
 Ah fool he mused to look for help from men
 Had they the will to aid they lack the power
 In mine own flesh and soul the sin had birth
 Through mine own anguish it must be atoned
 Our saviours are not saints and ministers
 But tearstrung women children soft of heart
 Or fellowsufferers who by some chance word
 Some glance of comfort save us from despair
 These I have found thank heaven to strengthen trust
 In mine own kind when all the world grew dark
 Make me not proud in spirit O my God
 Yea in thy sight I am one mass of sin
 One black and foul corruption yet I know
 My frailty is exceeded by thy love
 Neither is this the slender straw of hope
 Whereto I drowning cling but firm belief
 That fills my inmost soul with vast content
 As surely as the hollow faiths of old
 Shriveled to dust before one ray of Truth
 So will these modern temples pass away
 Piled upon rotten doctrines baseless forms
 And man will look in his own breast for help
 Yea search for comfort his own inward reins
 Revere himself and find the God within
 Patience and patience Through the sleepless night
 He held such thoughts at times before his eyes
 Flashed glimpses of the Church that was to be
 Sublimely simple in the light serene
 Of future ages then the vision changed
 To the Popes hall thronged with high priests who hurled
 Their curses on him Staggering he awoke
 Unto the truth and found himself alone
 Beneath the awful stars When dawns first chill
 Crept though the shivering grass and heavy leaves
 Giddy and overcome he fell and slept
 Upon the dripping weeds nor dreamed nor stirred
 Until the wide plain basked in noons broad light
 He dragged his weary frame some paces more
 Unto a solitary herdsmans hut
 Which in the vagueness of the moonlit night
 Was touched with lines of beauty till it grew
 Fair as the ruined works of ancient art
 Now squat and hideous with its wattled roof
 Decaying timbers and loose door wide oped
 Halffallen from the hinge A drowsy man
 Bearded and burnt in shepherd habit lay
 Stretched on the floor slowmunching half asleep
 His frugal fare for thus at blaze of noon
 The shepherds sought a shelter from the sun
 Leaving their vigilant dogs beside their flock
 The knight craved drink and bread and with respect
 For pilgrim weeds the Roman herdsman stirred
 His lazy length and shared with him his meal
 Refreshed and calm Sir Tannhauser passed forth
 Yearning with morbid fancy once again
 To see the kind face of the minstrel boy
 He met beside the well At set of sun
 He reached the place the reapingfolk were gone
 The days toil over yet he took his seat
 A milkinggirl with laden buckets full
 Came slowly from the pasture paused and drank
 From a near cottage ran a ragged boy
 And filled his wooden pail and to his home
 Returned across the fields A herdsman came
 And drank and gave his dog to drink and passed
 Greeting the holy man who sat there still
 Awaiting But his feeble pulse beat high
 When he descried at last a youthful form
 Crossing the field a pitcher on his head
 Advancing towards the well Yea this was he
 The same grave eyes and open girlish face
 But he saw not amidst the landscape brown
 The knights brown figure who to win his ear
 Asked the lads name My name is Salvator
 To serve you sir he carelessly replied
 With eyes and hands intent upon his jar
 Brimming and bubbling Then he cast one glance
 Upon his questioner and left the well
 Crying with keen and sudden sympathy
 Good Father pardon me I knew you not
 Ah you have travelled overmuch your feet
 Are grimed with mud and wet your face is changed
 Your hands are dry with fever But the knight
 Nay as I look on thee I think the Lord
 Wills not that I should suffer any more
 Then you have suffered much sighed Salvator
 With wondering pity You must come with me
 My father knows of you I told him all
 A knight and minstrel who cast by his lyre
 His health and fame to give himself to God
 Yours is a life indeed to be desired
 If you will lie with us this night our home
 Will verily be blessed By kindness crushed
 Wandering in sense and words the broken knight
 Resisted naught and let himself be led
 To the boys home The outcast and accursed
 Was welcomed now by kindly human hands
 Once more his blighted spirit was revived
 By contact with refreshing innocence
 There when the morning broke upon the world
 The humble hosts no longer knew their guest
 His fleshly weeds of sin forever doffed
 Tannhauser lay and smiled for in the night
 The angel came who brings eternal peace

 Far into Wartburg through all Italy
 In every town the Pope sent messengers
 Riding in furious haste among them one
 Who bore a branch of dry wood burst in bloom
 The pastoral rod had borne green shoots of spring
 And leaf and blossom God is merciful

LINKS


 The little and the great are joined in one
 By Gods great force The wondrous golden sun
 Is linked unto the glowworms tiny spark
 The eagle soars to heaven in his flight
 And in those realms of space all bathed in light
 Soar none except the eagle and the lark




MATINS


 Gray earth gray mist gray sky
 Through vapors hurrying by
 Larger than wont on high
 Floats the horned yellow moon
 Chill airs are faintly stirred
 And far away is heard
 Of some freshawakened bird
 The querulous shrill tune


 The dark mist hides the face
 Of the dim land no trace
 Of rock or rivers place
 In the thick air is drawn
 But dripping grass smells sweet
 And rustling branches meet
 And sounding water greet
 The slow sure sacred dawn


 Past is the long black night
 With its keen lightnings white
 Thunder and floods new light
 The glimmering low east streaks
 The dense clouds part between
 Their jagged rents are seen
 Pale reaches blue and green
 As the mirk curtain breaks


 Above the shadowy world
 Still more and more unfurled
 The gathered mists upcurled
 Like phantoms melt and pass
 In clearobscure revealed
 Brown wood gray stream dark field
 Fresh healthy odors yield
 Wet furrows flowers and grass


 The sudden splendid gleam
 Of one thin golden beam
 Shoots from the feathered rim
 Of yon hill crowned with woods
 Down its embowered side
 As living waters slide
 So the great morning tide
 Follows in sunny floods


 From bush and hedge and tree
 Joy unrestrained and free
 Breaks forth in melody
 Twitter and chirp and song
 Alive the festal air
 With gauzewinged creatures fair
 That flicker everywhere
 Dart poise and flash along


 The shining mists are gone
 Slight films of gold swiftblown
 Before the strong bright sun
 Or the deepcolored sky
 A world of life and glow
 Sparkles and basks below
 Where the soft meads arow
 Hoary with dewfall lie


 Does not the morn break thus
 Swift bright victorious
 With new skies cleared for us
 Over the soul stormtost
 Her night was long and deep
 Strange visions vexed her sleep
 Strange sorrows bade her weep
 Her faith in dawn was lost


 No halt no rest for her
 The immortal wanderer
 From sphere to higher sphere
 Toward the pure source of day
 The new light shames her fears
 Her faithlessness her tears
 As the new sun appears
 To light her godlike way




SAINT ROMUALDO


 I give God thanks that I a lean old man
 Wrinkled infirm and crippled with keen pains
 By austere penance and continuous toil
 Now rest in spirit and possess the peace
 Which passeth understanding Th end draws nigh
 Though the beginning is yesterday
 And a broad lifetime spreads twixt this and that
 A favored life though outwardly the butt
 Of ignominy malice and affront
 Yet lighted from within by the clear star
 Of a high aim and graciously prolonged
 To see at last its utmost goal attained
 I speak not of mine Order and my House
 Here founded by my hands and filled with saints
 A white society of snowy souls
 Swayed by my voice by mine example led
 For this is but the natural harvest reaped
 From labors such as mine when blessed by God
 Though I rejoice to think my spirit still
 Will work my purposes through worthy hands
 After my bones are shriveled into dust
 Yet have I gleaned a finer sweeter fruit
 Of holy satisfaction sure and real
 Though subtler than the tissue of the air
 The power completely to detach the soul
 From her companion through this life the flesh
 So that in blessed privacy of peace
 Communing with high angels she can hold
 Serenely rapt her solitary course


 Ye know O saints of heaven what I have borne
 Of discipline and scourge the twisted lash
 Of knotted rope that striped my shrinking limbs
 Vigils and fasts protracted till my flesh
 Wasted and crumbled from mine aching bones
 And the last skin one woof of pain and sores
 Thereto like yellow parchment loosely clung
 Exposure to the fever and the frost
 When mongst the hollows of the hills I lurked
 From persecution of misguided folk
 Accustoming my spirit to ignore
 The burden of the cross while picturing
 The bliss of disembodied souls the grace
 Of holiness the lives of sainted men
 And entertaining all exalted thoughts
 That nowise touched the trouble of the hour
 Until the grief and pain seemed far less real
 Than the creations of my brain inspired
 The vision the beatitude were true
 The agony was but an evil dream
 I speak not now as one who hath not learned
 The purport of those lightlybandied words
 Evil and Fate but rather one who knows
 The thunders of the terrors of the world
 No mortal chance or change no earthly shock
 Can move or reach my soul securely throned
 On heights of contemplation and calm prayer
 Happy serene no less actual joy
 Of present peace than faith in joys to come


 This soft sweet yellow evening how the trees
 Stand crisp against the clear brightcolored sky
 How the white mountaintops distinctly shine
 Taking and giving radiance and the slopes
 Are purpled with rich floods of peachhued light
 Thank God my filmy old dislustred eyes
 Find the same sense of exquisite delight
 My heart vibrates to the same touch of joy
 In scenes like this as when my pulse danced high
 And youth coursed through my veins This the one link
 That binds the wan old man that now I am
 To the wild lad who followed up the hounds
 Among Ravennas pinewoods by the sea
 For there how oft would I lose all delight
 In the pursuit the triumph or the game
 To stray alone among the shadowy glades
 And gaze as one who is not satisfied
 With gazing at the large bright breathing sea
 The forest glooms and shifting gleams between
 The fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees
 On goldgreen turf sweetbrier and wild pink rose
 How rich that buoyant air with changing scent
 Of pungent pine fresh flowers and salt cool seas
 And when all echoes of the chase had died
 Of horn and halloo bells and baying hounds
 How mine ears drank the ripple of the tide
 On the fair shore the chirp of unseen birds
 The rustling of the tangled undergrowth
 And the deep lyric murmur of the pines
 When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze
 There was my world there would my heart dilate
 And my aspiring soul dissolve in prayer
 Unto that Spirit of Love whose energies
 Were active round me yet whose presence sphered
 In the unsearchable unbodied air
 Made itself felt but reigned invisible
 This ere the day that made me what I am
 Still can I see the hot bright sky the sea
 Illimitably sparkling as they showed
 That morning Though I deemed I took no note
 Of heaven or earth or waters yet my mind
 Retains today the vivid portraiture
 Of every line and feature of the scene
 Lighthearted midst the dewy lanes I fared
 Unto the sea whose jocund gleam I caught
 Between the slim boles when I heard the clink
 Of naked weapons then a sudden thrust
 Sickening to hear and then a stifled groan
 And pressing forward I beheld the sight
 That seared itself for ever on my brain
 My kinsman Ser Ranieri on the turf
 Fallen upon his side his bright young head
 Among the pinespurs and his cheek pressed close
 Unto the moist chill sod his fingers clutched
 A handful of loose weeds and grass and earth
 Uprooted in his anguish as he fell
 And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed
 Fouling the green leaving the fair sweet face
 Ghastly transparent with blue stony eyes
 Staring in blankness on that other one
 Who triumphed over him With hot desire
 Of instant vengeance I unsheathed my sword
 To rush upon the slayer when he turned
 In his first terror of bloodguiltiness

       

 Within my heart a something snapped and brake
 What was it but the chord of rapturous joy
 For ever stilled I tottered and would fall
 Had I not leaned against the friendly pine
 For all realities of life unmoored
 From their firm anchorage appeared to float
 Like hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain
 The strange delusion wrought upon my soul
 That this had been enacted ages since
 This very horror curdled at my heart
 This net of trees spread round these iron heavens
 Were closing over me when I had stood
 Unnumbered cycles back and fronted HIM
 My father and he felt mine eyes as now
 Yet saw me not and then as now that form
 The one thing real lay stretched between us both
 The fancy passed and I stood sane and strong
 To grasp the truth Then I remembered all
 A few fierce words between them yester eve
 Concerning some poor plot of pasturage
 Soon silenced into courteous frigid calm
 This was the end I could not meet him now
 To curse him to accuse him or to save
 And draw him from the red entanglement
 Coiled by his own hands round his ruined life
 God pardon me My heart that moment held
 No drop of pity toward this wretched soul
 And cowering down as though his guilt were mine
 I fled amidst the savage silences
 Of that grim wood resolved to nurse alone
 My boundless desolation shame and grief


 There in that thickleaved twilight of high noon
 The quiet of the still suspended air
 Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged
 Shepherded by my will I wept I prayed
 A solemn prayer conceived in agony
 Blessed with response instant miraculous
 For in that hour my spirit was at one
 With Him who knows and satisfies her needs
 The supplication and the blessing sprang
 From the same source inspired divinely both
 I prayed for light selfknowledge guidance truth
 And these like heavenly manna were rained down
 To feed my hungered soul His guilt was mine
 What angel had been sent to stay mine arm
 Until the fateful moment passed away
 That would have ushered an eternity
 Of withering remorse I found the germs
 In mine own heart of every human sin
 That waited but occasions tempting breath
 To overgrow with poisoned bloom my life
 What God thus far had saved me from myself
 Here was the lofty truth revealed that each
 Must feel himself in all must know whereer
 The great soul acts or suffers or enjoys
 His proper soul in kinship there is bound
 Then my lifepurpose dawned upon my mind
 Encouraging as morning As I lay
 Crushed by the weight of universal love
 Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself
 I heard the clear chime of a slow sweet bell
 I knew itwhence it came and what it sang
 From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed
 And called the monks to prayer Vigil and prayer
 Clean lives white days of strict austerity
 Such were the offerings of these holy saints
 How far might such not tend to expiate
 A riotous worlds indulgence Here my life
 Doubly austere and doubly sanctified
 Might even for that other one atone
 So bound to mine till both should be forgiven


 They sheltered me not questioning the need
 That led me to their cloistered solitude
 How rich how freighted with pure influence
 With dear security of perfect peace
 Was the first day I passed within those walls
 The holy habit of perpetual prayer
 The gentle greetings the rare temperate speech
 The chastening discipline the atmosphere
 Of settled and profound tranquillity
 Were even as living waters unto one
 Who perisheth of thirst Was this the world
 That yesterday seemed one huge battlefield
 For brutish passions Could the soul of man
 Withdraw so easily and erect apart
 Her own fair temple for her own high ends
 But this serene contentment slowly waned
 As I discerned the broad disparity
 Betwixt the form and spirit of the laws
 That bound the order in strait brotherhood
 Yet when I sought to gain a larger love
 More rigid discipline severer truth
 And more complete surrender of the soul
 Unto her God this was to my reproach
 And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides
 In mine own cell I mortified my flesh
 I held aloof from all my brethrens feasts
 To wrestle with my viewless enemies
 Till they should leave their blessing on my head
 For nightly was I haunted by that face
 White bloodless as I saw it midst the ferns
 Now staring out of darkness and it held
 Mine eyes from slumber and my brain from rest
 And drove me from my straw to weep and pray
 Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wrought
 Upon my spirit that I lay daylong
 In dumb despair until the blessed hope
 Of mercy dawned again upon my soul
 As gradual as the slow gold moon that mounts
 The airy steps of heaven My faith arose
 With sure perception that disaster wrong
 And every shadow of mans destiny
 Are merely circumstance and cannot touch
 The souls fine essence they exist or die
 Only as she affirms them or denies


 This faith sustain me even to the end
 It floods my heart with peace as surely now
 As on that day the friars drove me forth
 Urging that my asceticism too harsh
 Endured through pride would bring into reproach
 Their customs and their order Then began
 My exile in the mountains where I bode
 A hunted man The elements conspired
 Against me and I was the seasons sport
 Drenched parched and scorched and frozen alternately
 Burned with shrewd frosts prostrated by fierce heats
 Shivering neath chilling dews and gusty rains
 And buffeted by all the winds of heaven
 Yet was this period my time of joy
 My daily thoughts perpetual converse held
 With angels ministrant mine ears were charmed
 With sweet accordance of celestial sounds
 Song harp and choir clear ringing through the air
 And visions were revealed unto mine eyes
 By night and day of Heavens very courts
 In shadowless undimmed magnificence
 I gave God thanks not that He sheltered me
 And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air
 For had I perished this too had been well
 But for the revelation of His truth
 The glory the beatitude vouchsafed
 To exalt to heal to quicken to inspire
 So that the pinched lean excommunicate
 Was crowned with joy more solid more secure
 Than all the comfort of the vales could bring
 Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts
 Aspiring toward His love to come to me
 Timid and few at first but as they heard
 From mine own lips the precious oracles
 That soothed the trouble of their souls appeased
 Their spiritual hunger and disclosed
 All of the God within them to themselves
 They flocked about me and they hailed me saint
 And sware to follow and to serve the good
 Which my word published and my life declared
 Thus the lone hermit of the mountaintop
 Descended leader of a band of saints
 And midway twixt the summit and the vale
 I perched my convent Yet I bated not
 One whit of strict restraint and abstinence
 And they who love me and who serve the truth
 Have learned to suffer with me and have won
 The supreme joy that is not of the flesh
 Foretasting the delights of Paradise
 This faith to them imparted will endure
 After my tongue hath ceased to utter it
 And the great peace hath settled on my soul




AFTERNOON


 Small shapeless drifts of cloud
 Sail slowly northward in the softhued sky
 With blur halftints and rolling summits bright
 By the late sun caressed slight hazes shroud
 All things afar shineth each leaf anigh
 With its own warmth and light


 Oerblown by Southland airs
 The summer landscape basks in utter peace
 In lazy streams the lazy clouds are seen
 Low hills broad meadows and large clearcut squares
 Of ripening cornfields rippled by the breeze
 With shifting shade and sheen


 Hark and you may not hear
 A sound less soothing than the rustle cool
 Of swaying leaves the steady wiry drone
 Of unseen crickets sudden chirpings clear
 Of happy birds the tinkle of the pool
 Chafed by a single stone


 What vague delicious dreams
 Born of this golden hour of afternoon
 And air balmfreighted fill the soul with bliss
 Transpierced like yonder clouds with lustrous gleams
 Fantastic brief as they and like them spun
 Of gilded nothingness


 All things are well with her
 T is good to be alive to see the light
 That plays upon the grass to feel and sigh
 With perfect pleasure the mild breezes stir
 Among the garden roses red and white
 With whiffs of fragrancy


 There is no troublous thought
 No painful memory no grave regret
 To mar the sweet suggestions of the hour
 The soul at peace reflects the peace without
 Forgetting grief as sunset skies forget
 The mornings transient shower




PHANTASIES

 After Robert Schumann


 I Evening


 Rest beauty stillness not a waif of a cloud
 From grayblue east sheer to the yellow west
 No film of mist the utmost slopes to shroud


 The earth lies grace by quiet airs caressed
 And shepherdeth her shadows but each stream
 Free to the sky is by that glow possessed
 And traileth with the splendors of a dream
 Athwart the dusky land Uplift thine eyes
 Unbroken by a vapor or a gleam


 The vast clear reach of mild wan twilight skies
 But look again and lo the evening star
 Against the pale tints black the slim elms rise


 The earth exhales sweet odors nigh and far
 And from the heavens fine influences fall
 Familiar things stand not for what they are


 What they suggest foreshadow or recall
 The spirit is alert to apprehend
 Imparting somewhat of herself to all


 Labor and thought and care are at an end
 The soul is filled with gracious reveries
 And with her mood soft sounds and colors blend


 For simplest sounds ring forth like melodies
 In this weirdlighted airthe monotone
 Of some far bell the distant farmyard cries


 A barking dog the thin persistent drone
 Of crickets and the lessening call of birds
 The apparition of yon star alone


 Breaks on the sense like music Beyond word
 The peace that floods the soul for night is here
 And Beauty still is guide and harbinger




 II Aspiration


 Dark lies the earth and bright with worlds the sky
 That soft large lustrous star that first outshone
 Still holds us spelled with potent sorcery


 Dilating shrinking lightening it hath won
 Our spirit with its strange strong influence
 And sways it as the tides beneath the moon


 What impulse this oermastering heart and sense
 Exalted thrilled the freed soul fain would soar
 Unto that point of shining prominence


 Craving new fields and some unheardof shore
 Yea all the heavens for her activity
 To mount with daring flight to hover oer


 Low hills of earth flat meadows level sea
 And earthly joy and trouble In this hour
 Of waning light and sound of mystery


 Of shadowed love and beautyveiled power
 She feels her wings she yearns to grasp her own
 Knowing the utmost good to be her dower


 A dream a dream for at a touch t is gone
 O mocking spirit thy mere fools are we
 Unto the depths from heights celestial thrown


 From these blind gropings toward reality
 This thirst for truth this most pathetic need
 Of something to uplift to justify


 To help and comfort while we faint and bleed
 May we not draw wrung from the last despair
 Some argument of hope some blessed creed


 That we can trust the faith which whispers prayer
 The vanishings the ecstasy the gleam
 The nameless aspiration and the dream




 III Wherefore


 Deep languor overcometh mind and frame
 A listless drowsy utter weariness
 A trance wherein no thought finds speech or name


 The overstrained spirit doth possess
 She sinks with drooping wingpoor unfledged bird
 That fain had flownin fluttering breathlessness


 To what end those high hopes that wildly stirred
 The beating heart with aspirations vain
 Why proffer prayers unanswered and unheard


 To blank deaf heavens that will not heed her pain
 Where lead these lofty soaring tendencies
 That leap and fly and poise to fall again


 Yet seem to link her with the utmost skies
 What mean these clinging loves that bind to earth
 And claim her with beseeching wistful eyes


 This little restingplace twixt death and birth
 Why is it fretted with the ceaseless flow
 Of flood and ebb with overgrowth and dearth


 And vext with dreams and clouded with strange woe
 Ah she is tired of thought she yearns for peace
 Seeing all things one equal end must know


 Wherefore this tangle of perplexities
 The trouble or the joy the weary maze
 Of narrow fears and hopes that may not cease


 A chill falls on her from the skyey ways
 Black with the nighttide where is none to hear
 The ancient cry the Wherefore of our days




 IV Fancies


 The ceaseless whirr of crickets fills the ear
 From underneath each hedge and bush and tree
 Deep in the dewdrenched grasses everywhere


 The simple sound dispels the fantasy
 Of gloom and terror gathering round the mind
 It seems a pleasant thing to breathe to be


 To hear the manyvoiced soft summer wind
 Lisp through the dark thick leafage overhead
 To see the rosy halfmoon soar behind


 The black slimbranching elms Sad thoughts have fled
 Trouble and doubt and now strange reveries
 And odd caprices fill us in their stead


 From yonder broken disk the redness dies
 Like gold fruit through the leaves the halfsphere gleams
 Then over the hoar treetops climbs the skies


 Blanched ever more and more until it beams
 Whiter than crystal Like a scroll unfurled
 And shadowy as a landscape seen in dreams


 Reveals itself the sleeping quiet world
 Painted in tender grays and whites subdued
 The speckled stream with flakes of light impearled


 The wide soft meadow and the massive wood
 Naught is too wild for our credulity
 In this weird hour our finest dreams hold good


 Quaint elves and frolic flowersprites we see
 And fairies weaving rings of gossamer
 And angels floating through the filmy air




 V In the Night


 Let us go in the air is dank and chill
 With dewy midnight and the moon rides high
 Oer ghostly fields pale stream and spectral hill


 This hour the dawn seems farthest from the sky
 So weary long the space that lies between
 That sacred joy and this dark mystery


 Of earth and heaven no glimmering is seen
 In the starsprinkled east of coming day
 Nor westward of the splendor that hath been


 Strange fears beset us nameless terrors sway
 The brooding soul that hungers for her rest
 Out worn with changing moods vain hopes delay


 With conscious thought oerburdened and oppressed
 The mystery and the shadow wax too deep
 She longs to merge both sense and thought in sleep




 VI Faerie


 From the oped lattice glance once more abroad
 While the ethereal moontide bathes with light
 Hill stream and garden and whitewinding road


 All gracious myths born of the shadowy night
 Recur and hover in fantastic guise
 Airy and vague before the drowsy sight


 On yonder soft gray hill Endymion lies
 In rosy slumber and the moonlit air
 Breathes kisses on his cheeks and lips and eyes


 Twixt bush and bush gleam flowerwhite limbs left bare
 Of huntressnymphs and flying raiment thin
 Vanishing faces and bright floating hair


 The quaint midsummer fairies and their kin
 Gnomes elves and trolls on blossom branch and grass
 Gambol and dance and winding out and in


 Leave circles of spun dew whereer they pass
 Through the blue ether the freed Ariel flies
 Enchantment holds the air a swarming mass


 Of myriad dusky goldwinged dreams arise
 Throng toward the gates of sense and so possess
 The soul and lull it to forgetfulness




 VII Confused Dreams


 O strange dim otherworld revealed to us
 Beginning there where ends reality
 Lying twixt life and death and populous


 With souls from either sphere now enter we
 Thy twisted paths Barred is the silver gate
 But the wildcarven doors of ivory


 Spring noiselessly apart between them straight
 Flies forth a cloud of nameless shadowy things
 With harpies imps and monsters small and great


 Blurring the thick air with darkening wings
 All humors of the blood and brain take shape
 And fright us with our own imaginings


 A trouble weighs upon us no escape
 From this unnatural region can there be
 Fixed eyes stare on us wide mouths grin and gape


 Familiar faces out of reach we see
 Fain would we scream to shatter with a cry
 The tangled woof of hideous fantasy


 When lo the air grows clear a soft fair sky
 Shines over head sharp pain dissolves in peace
 Beneath the silver archway quietly


 We float away all troublous visions cease
 By a strange sense of joy we are possessed
 Body and spirit soothed in perfect rest




 VIII The End of the Song


 What dainty note of longdrawn melody
 Athwart our dreamless sleep rings sweet and clear
 Till all the fumes of slumber are brushed by


 And with awakened consciousness we hear
 The pipe of birds Look forth The sane white day
 Blesses the hilltops and the sun is near


 All misty phantoms slowly roll away
 With the nights vapors toward the western sky
 The Real enchants us the fresh breath of hay


 Blows toward us soft the meadowgrasses lie
 Bearded with dew the air is a caress
 The sudden sun oertops the boundary


 Of eastern hills the morning joyousness
 Thrills tingling through the frame lifes pulse beats strong
 Nights fancies melt like dew So ends the song




ON THE PROPOSAL TO ERECT A MONUMENT IN ENGLAND TO LORD BYRON


 The grass of fifty Aprils hath waved green
 Above the spent heart the Olympian head
 The hands crost idly the shut eyes unseen
 Unseeing the locked lips whose song hath fled
 Yet mysticlived like some rich tropic flower
 His fame puts forth fresh blossoms hour by hour
 Wide spread the laden branches dropping dew
 On the low laureled brow misunderstood
 That bent not neither bowed until subdued
 By the last foe who crowned while he oerthrew


 Fair was the Easter Sabbath morn when first
 Men heard he had not wakened to its light
 The end had come and time had done its worst
 For the black cloud had fallen of endless night
 Then in the town as Greek accosted Greek
 T was not the wonted festal words to speak
 Christ is arisen but Our chief is gone
 With such wan aspect and griefsmitten head
 As when the awful cry of Pan is dead
 Filled echoing hill and valley with its moan


 I am more fit for death than the world deems
 So spake he as lifes light was growing dim
 And turned to sleep as unto soothing dreams
 What terrors could its darkness hold for him
 Familiar with all anguish but with fear
 Still unacquainted On his martial bier
 They laid a sword a helmet and a crown
 Meed of the warrior but not these among
 His voiceless lyre whose silent chords unstrung
 Shall waithow longfor touches like his own


 An alien country mourned him as her son
 And hailed him hero his sole fitting tomb
 Were Theseus temple or the Parthenon
 Fondly she deemed His brethren bare him home
 Their exiled glory past the guarded gate
 Where Englands Abbey shelters Englands great
 Afar he rests whose very name hath shed
 New lustre on her with the song he sings
 So Shakespeare rests who scorned to lie with kings
 Sleeping at peace midst the unhonored dead


 And fifty years suffice to overgrow
 With gentle memories the foul weeds of hate
 That shamed his grave The world begins to know
 Her loss and view with other eyes his fate
 Even as the cunning workman brings to pass
 The sculptors thought from out the unwieldy mass
 Of shapeless marble so Time lops away
 The stony crust of falsehood that concealed
 His just proportions and at last revealed
 The statue issues to the light of day


 Most beautiful most human Let them fling
 The first stone who are tempted even as he
 And have not swerved When did that rare soul sing
 The victims shame the tyrants eulogy
 The great belittle or exalt the small
 Or grudge his gift his blood to disenthrall
 The slaves of tyranny or ignorance
 Stung by fierce tongues himself whose rightful fame
 Hath he reviled Upon what noble name
 Did the winged arrows of the barbed wit glance


 The years thick clinging curtains backward pull
 And show him as he is crowned with bright beams
 Beauteous and yet not all as beautiful
 As he hath been or might be Sorrow seems
 Half of his immortality He needs
 No monument whose name and song and deeds
 Are graven in all foreign hearts but she
 His mother England slow and last to wake
 Needs raise the votive shaft for her fames sake
 Hers is the shame if such forgotten be

 Cain Act I Scene 1




ARABESQUE


 On a background of pale gold
 I would trace with quaint design
 Penciled fine
 Brilliantcolored Moorish scenes
 Mosques and crescents pages queens
 Line on line
 That the proseworld of today
 Might the gorgeous Pasts array
 Once behold


 On the magic painted shield
 Rich Granadas Vega green
 Should be seen
 Crystal fountains coolness flinging
 Hanging gardens skyward springing
 Emerald sheen
 Ruddy when the daylight falls
 Crowned Alhambras beetling walls
 Stand revealed


 Balconies that overbrow
 Field and city vale and stream
 In a dream
 Lulled the drowsy landscape basks
 Mark the gleam
 Silvery of each whiteswathed peak
 Mountainairs caress the cheek
 Fresh from the snow


 Here in Lindaraxas bower
 The immortal roses bloom
 In the room
 Lionguarded marblepaven
 Still the fountain leaps to heaven
 But the doom
 Of the banned and stricken race
 Overshadows every place
 Every hour


 Where fair Lindaraxa dwelt
 Flits the bat on velvet wings
 Mute the strings
 Of the broken mandoline
 The Pavilion of the Queen
 Widely flings
 Vacant windows to the night
 Moonbeams kiss the floor with light
 Where she knelt


 Through these halls that people stepped
 Who through darkling centuries
 Held the keys
 Of all wisdom truth and art
 In a Paradise apart
 Lapped in ease
 Sagely pondering deathless themes
 While befooled with monkish dreams
 Europe slept


 Where shall they be found today
 Yonder hill that frets the sky
 The last Sigh
 Of the Moor is named still
 There the illstarred Boabdil
 Bade goodby
 To Granada and to Spain
 Where the Crescent neer again
 Holdeth sway


 Vanished like the wind that blows
 Whither shall we seek their trace
 On earths face
 The gigantic wheel of fate
 Crushing all things soon or late
 Now a race
 Now a single life oerruns
 Now a universe of suns
 Now a rose




AGAMEMNONS TOMB


 Uplift the ponderous golden mask of death
 And let the sun shine on him as it did
 How many thousand years agone Beneath
 This wormdefying uncorrupted lid
 Behold the young heroic face roundeyed
 Of one who in his fullflowered manhood died
 Of nobler frame than creatures of today
 Swathed in fine linen cerecloths fold on fold
 With carven weapons wrought of bronze and gold
 Accoutred like a warrior for the fray


 We gaze in awe at these hugemodeled limbs
 Shrunk in deaths narrow house but hinting yet
 Their ancient majesty these sightless rims
 Whose living eyes the eyes of Helen met
 The speechless lips that ah what tales might tell
 Of earths morningtide when gods did dwell
 Amidst a generousfashioned godlike race
 Who dwarf our puny semblance and who won
 The secret soul of Beauty for their own
 While all our art but crudely apes their grace


 We gather all the precious relics up
 The golden buttons chased with wondrous craft
 The sculptured trinkets and the crystal cup
 The sheathed bronze sword the knife with brazen haft
 Fain would we wrest with curious eyes from these
 Unnumbered longforgotten histories
 The deeds heroic of this mighty man
 On whom once more the living daylight beams
 To shame our littleness to mock our dreams
 And the abyss of centuries to span


 Yet could we rouse him from his blind repose
 How might we meet his searching questionings
 Concerning all the follies wrongs and woes
 Since his great day whom men call King of Kings
 Victorious Agamemnon How might we
 Those large clear eyes confront which scornfully
 Would view us as a poor degenerate race
 Basesouled and meanproportioned What reply
 Give to the beautyloving Greeks heartcry
 Seeking his ancient gods in vacant space


 What should he find within a world grown cold
 Save doubt and trouble To his sunny creed
 A thousand gloomy warring sects succeed
 How of the Prince of Peace might he be told
 When over half the world the warcloud lowers
 How would he mock these faltering hopes of ours
 Who knows the secret now of death and fate
 Humbly we gaze on the colossal frame
 And mutely we accept the mortal shame
 Of men degraded from a high estate





SIC SEMPER LIBERATORIBUS


 March 13 1881

 As one who feels the breathless nightmare grip
 His heartstrings and through visioned horrors fares
 Now on a thinledged chasms rockcrumbling lip
 Now on a tottering pinnacle that dare
 The front of heaven while always unawares
 Weird monsters start above around beneath
 Each glaring from some uglier mask of death


 So the White Czar imperial progress made
 Through terrorhaunted days A shock a cry
 Whose echoes ring the globethe spectres laid
 Hurled oer the abyss see the crowned martyr lie
 Resting in peacefear change and death gone by
 Fit end for nightmaremist of blood and tears
 Red climax to the slow abortive years


 The world draws breathone long deepshuddering sigh
 At that which dullest brain prefigured clear
 As swiftsure bolt from thunderthreatening sky
 How heavenanointed humblest lots appear
 Beside his glittering eminence of fear
 His spiked crown sackcloth purple poisoned cates
 His golden palace honeycombed with hates


 Well is it done A most heroic plan
 Which after myriad plots succeeds at last
 In robbing of his life this poor old man
 Whose sole offensehis birthrighthas but passed
 To fresher blood with younger strength recast
 What men are these who clamoring to be free
 Would bestialize the world to what they be


 Whose sons are they who made the snowwreathed head
 Their frenzys target In their Russian veins
 What alien current urged on to smite him dead
 Whose word had loosed a million Russian chains
 What brutes were they for whom such speechless pains
 So royally endured no human thrill
 Awoke in hearts drunk with the lust to kill


 Not brutes No tiger of the wilderness
 No jackal of the jungle bears such brand
 As mans black heart who shrinks not to confess
 The desperate deed of his deliberate hand
 Our kind our kin have done this thing We stand
 Bowed earthward red with shame to see such wrong
 Prorogue Loves cause and TruthsGod knows how long




DON RAFAEL


 I would not have he said
 Tears nor the black pall nor the wormy grave
 Griefs hideous panoply I would not have
 Round me when I am dead


 Music and flowers and light
 And choric dances to guitar and flute
 Be these around me when my lips are mute
 Mine eyes are sealed from sight


 So let me lie one day
 One long eternal day in sunshine bathed
 In cerements of silken tissue swathed
 Smothered neath flowers of May

 One perfect day of peace
 Or ere clean flame consume my fleshly veil
 My lifea gilded vaporshall exhale
 Brief as a sighand cease


 But ere the torch be laid
 To my unshrinking limbs by some true hand
 Athwart the orangefragrant laughing land
 Bring many a darkeyed maid


 From the bright seakissed town
 My beautiful beloved enemies
 Gemmed as the dew voluptuous as the breeze
 Each in her festal gown


 All those through whom I learned
 The sweet of folly and the pains of love
 My Rose my Star my Comforter my Dove
 For whom poor moth I burned


 Loves of a day and hour
 Or passions vowed eternal of a year
 Though each be strange to each to me all dear
 As to the bee the flower


 Around me they shall move
 In languid contra dances and shall shed
 Their smiling eyebeams as I were not dead
 But quick to flash back love


 Something not alien quite
 To tender ruth perchance their breast shall fill
 Seeing him that was so mobile grown so still
 The fieryveined so white


 And when the dance is oer
 The pinched guitar the smitten tambourine
 Have ceased their rhythmic beatoh friends of mine
 On my rich bier then pour


 The garlands that ye wear
 The happy rose that on your bosom breathes
 The freshculled clusters and the dewy wreaths
 That crown your fragrant hair


 Though blind I still shall see
 Though dead shall feel your presence and shall know
 I who was beautys lifelong slave shall so
 Win her in death to me


 Thanks sisters and farewell
 Back to your joys My brother shall make room
 For my tried sword upon the highpiled bloom
 And fire the pinnacle


 My soul pure flame shall leap
 To meet its parent essence once again
 My body dust and ashes shall remain
 Tired heart and brain shall sleep


 Life has one gate alone
 Obscure beset with peril and fierce pain
 Large death has many portals to his fane
 Why choose we to make moan


 Why dwell with worms and clay
 When we may soar through air on wings of flame
 Dissolve to small white dust our perfect frame
 And never know decay


 A brothers pious hand
 The pure firewinnowed ashes shall inurn
 And lay them in the orange grove where burn
 Globed suns that scent the land


 The leaf shall be more green
 Even for my dustmore snowysoft the flower
 More juicysweet the fruits live pulpthe bower
 Richer that I have been


 For I would not he said
 Tears and the black pall and the wormy grave
 Griefs hideous panoply I would not have
 Round me when I am dead




OFF ROUGH POINT


 We sat at twilight nigh the sea
 The fog hung gray and weird
 Through the thick film uncannily
 The broken moon appeared


 We heard the billows crack and plunge
 We saw nor waves nor ships
 Earth sucked the vapors like a sponge
 The salt spray wet our lips


 Closer the woof of white mist drew
 Before behind beside
 How could that phantom moon break through
 Above that shrouded tide


 The roaring waters filled the ear
 A white blank foiled the sight
 Closegathering shadows near more near
 Brought the blind awful night


 O friends who passed unseen unknown
 O dashing troubled sea
 Still stand we on a rock alone
 Walled round by mystery




MATER AMABILIS


 Down the goldenest of streams
 Tide of dreams
 The fair cradled manchild drifts
 Sways with cadenced motion slow
 To and fro
 As the motherfoot poised lightly falls and lifts


 He the firstlinghe the light
 Of her sight
 He the breathing pledge of love
 Neath the holy passion lies
 Of her eyes
 Smiles to feel the warm lifegiving ray above


 She believes that in his vision
 Skies elysian
 Oer an angelpeople shine
 Back to gardens of delight
 Taking flight
 His auroral spirit basks in dreams divine


 But she smiles through anxious tears
 Unborn years
 Pressing forward she perceives
 Shadowy muffled shapes they come
 Deaf and dumb
 Bringing what dry chaff and tares or fulleared sheaves


 What for him shall she invoke
 Shall the oak
 Bind the mans triumphant brow
 Shall his daring foot alight
 On the height
 Shall he dwell amidst the humble and the low


 Through what tears and sweat and pain
 Must he gain
 Fruitage from the tree of life
 Shall it yield him bitter flavor
 Shall its savor
 Be as manna midst the turmoil and the strife


 In his cradle slept and smiled
 Thus the child
 Who as Prince of Peace was hailed
 Thus anigh the mother breast
 Lulled to rest
 ChildNapoleon down the lilied river sailed


 Crowned or crucifiedthe same
 Glows the flame
 Of her deathless love divine
 Still the blessed mother stands
 In all lands
 As she watched beside thy cradle and by mine


 Whatso gifts the years bestow
 Still men know
 While she breathes lives one who sees
 Stand they pure or sindefiled
 But the child
 Whom she crooned to sleep and rocked upon her knee




FOG


 Light silken curtain colorless and soft
 Dreamlike before me floating what abides
 Behind thy pearly veils
 Opaque mysterious woof


 Where sleek red kine and dappled crunch daylong
 Thick luscious blades and purple cloverheads
 Nigh me I still can mark
 Cool fields of beaded grass


 No more for on the rim of the globed world
 I seem to stand and stare at nothingness
 But songs of unseen birds
 And tranquil roll of waves


 Bring sweet assurance of continuous life
 Beyond this silvery cloud Fantastic dreams
 Of tissue subtler still
 Than the wreathed fog arise


 And cheat my brain with airy vanishings
 And mystic glories of the world beyond
 A whole enchanted town
 Thy baffling folds conceal


 An Orient town with slendersteepled mosques
 Turret from turret springing dome from dome
 Fretted with burning stones
 And trellised with red gold


 Through spacious streets where running waters flow
 Sunscreened by fruittrees and the broadleaved palm
 Past the gaydecked bazaars
 Walk turbaned darkeyed men


 Hark you can hear the many murmuring tongues
 While loud the merchants vaunt their gorgeous wares
 The sultry air is spiced
 With fragrance of rich gums


 And through the lattice high in yon dead wall
 See where unveiled an arch young dimpled face
 Flushed like a musky peach
 Peers down upon the mart


 From her dark ringleted and birdpoised head
 She hath cast back the milkwhite silken veil
 Midst the blank blackness there
 She blossoms like a rose


 Beckons she not with those bright fullorbed eyes
 And open arms that like twin moonbeams gleam
 Behold her smile on me
 With honeyed scarlet lips


 Divine Scheherazade I am thine
 I come I comeHark from some faroff mosque
 The shrill muezzin calls
 The hour of silent prayer


 And from the lattice he hath scared my love
 The lattice vanisheth itselfthe street
 The mart the Orient town
 Only through still soft air


 That cry is yet prolonged I wake to hear
 The distant foghorn peal before mine eyes
 Stands the white wall of mist
 Blending with vaporous skies


 Elusive gossamer impervious
 Even to the mighty sungods keen red shafts
 With what a jealous art
 Thy secret thou dost guard


 Well do I know deep in thine inmost folds
 Within an opal hollow there abides
 The lady of the mist
 The Undine of the air


 A slender winged ethereal lily form
 Doveeyed with fair freefloating pearlwreathed hair
 In waving raiment swathed
 Of changing irised hues


 Where her feet rosy as a shell have grazed
 The freshened grass a richer emerald glows
 Into each flowercup
 Her cool dews she distills


 She knows the tops of jagged mountainpeaks
 She knows the green soft hollows of their sides
 And unafraid she floats
 Oer the vastcircled seas


 She loves to bask within the moons wan beams
 Lying nightlong upon the moist dark earth
 And leave her seeded pearls
 With morning on the grass


 Ah that athwart these dim gray outer courts
 Of her fantastic palace I might pass
 And reach the inmost shrine
 Of her chaste solitude


 And feel her cool and dewy fingers press
 My mortalfevered brow while in my heart
 She poured with tender love
 Her healing Lethebalm


 See the close curtain moves the spell dissolves
 Slowly it lifts the dazzling sunshine streams
 Upon a newborn world
 And laughing summer seas


 Swift snowybreasted sandbirds twittering glance
 Through crystal air On the horizons marge
 Like a huge purple wraith
 The dusky fog retreats




THE ELIXIR


 Oh brew me a potion strong and good
 One golden drop in his wine
 Shall charm his sense and fire his blood
 And bend his will to mine


 Poor child of passion ask of me
 Elixir of death or sleep
 Or Lethes stream but love is free
 And woman must wait and weep




SONG


 Venus

 Frosty lies the winterlandscape
 In the twilight goldengreen
 Down the Parks deserted alleys
 Naked elms stand stark and lean


 Dumb the murmur of the fountain
 Birds have flown from lawn and hill
 But while yonder stars ascendant
 Love triumphal reigneth still


 See the keen flame throb and tremble
 Brightening in the darkening night
 Breathing like a thing of passion
 In the skys smooth chrysolite


 Not beneath the moon oh lover
 Thou shalt gain thy hearts desire
 Speak tonight The gods are with thee
 Burning with a kindred fire




SPRING LONGING


 What art thou doing here O Imagination Go
 away I entreat thee by the gods as thou didst
 come for I want thee not But thou art come
 according to thy old fashion I am not angry
 with theeonly go away
 Marcus Antoninus

 Lilac hazes veil the skies
 Languid sighs
 Breathes the mild caressing air
 Pink as corals branching sprays
 Orchard ways
 With the blossomed peach are fair


 Sunshine cordial as a kiss
 Poureth bliss
 In this craving soul of mine
 And my heart her flowercup
 Lifteth up
 Thirsting for the draught divine


 Swift the liquid golden flame
 Through my frame
 Sets my throbbing veins afire
 Bright alluring dreams arise
 Brim mine eyes
 With the tears of strong desire


 All familiar scenes anear
 Disappear
 Homestead orchard field and wold
 Moorish spires and turrets fair
 Cleave the air
 Arabesqued on skies of gold


 Low my spirit this May morn
 Outward borne
 Over seas hath taken wing
 Where the mediaeval town
 Like a crown
 Wears the garland of the Spring


 Light and sound and odors sweet
 Fill the street
 Gypsy girls are selling flowers
 Lean hidalgos turn aside
 Amorouseyed
 Neath the grim cathedral towers


 Oh to be in Spain today
 Where the May
 Recks no whit of good or evil
 Love and only love breathes she
 Oh to be
 Midst the oliverows of Seville


 Or on such a day to glide
 With the tide
 Of the berylline lagoon
 Through the streets that mirror heaven
 Crystal paven
 In the warm Venetian noon


 At the prow the gondolier
 May not hear
 May not see our furtive kiss
 But he lends with cadenced strain
 The refrain
 To our ripe and silent bliss


 Golden shadows silver light
 Burnish bright
 Air and water domes and skies
 As in some ambrosial dream
 On the stream
 Floats our bark in magic wise


 Oh to float day long just so
 Naught to know
 Of the trouble toil and fret
 This is love and this is May
 Yesterday
 And tomorrow to forget


 Whither hast thou Fancy free
 Guided me
 Wild Bohemian sister dear
 All thy gypsy soul is stirred
 Since yon bird
 Warbled that the Spring was here


 Tempt no more I may not follow
 Like the swallow
 Gayly on the track of Spring
 Bounden by an iron fate
 I must wait
 Dream and wonder yearn and sing




THE SOUTH


 Night and beneath starblazoned summer skies
 Behold the Spirit of the musky South
 A creole with stillburning languid eyes
 Voluptuous limbs and incensebreathing mouth
 Swathed in spun gauze is she
 From fibres of her own anana tree


 Within these sumptuous woods she lies at ease
 By rich nightbreezes dewy cool caressed
 Twixt cypresses and slim palmetto trees
 Like to the golden orioles hanging nest
 Her airy hammock swings
 And through the dark her mockingbird yet sings


 How beautiful she is A tulipwreath
 Twines round her shadowy freefloating hair
 Young weary passionate and sad as death
 Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air
 While movelessly she lies
 With lithe lax folded hands and heavy eyes


 Full well knows she how wide and fair extend
 Her groves brightflowered her tangled everglades
 Majestic streams that indolently wend
 Through lush savanna or dense forest shades
 Where the brown buzzard flies
 To broad bayou neath hazygolden skies


 Hers is the savage splendor of the swamp
 With pomp of scarlet and of purple bloom
 Where blow warm furtive breezes faint and damp
 Strange insects whir and stalking bitterns boom
 Where from stale waters dead
 Oft looms the greatjawed alligators head


 Her wealth her beauty and the blight on these
 Of all she is aware luxuriant woods
 Fresh living sunlit in her dream she sees
 And ever midst those verdant solitudes
 The soldiers wooden cross
 Oergrown by creeping tendrils and rank moss


 Was her a dream of empire was it sin
 And is it well that all was borne in vain
 She knows no more than one who slow doth win
 After fierce fever conscious life again
 Too tired too weak too sad
 By the new light to be stirred or glad


 From rich seaislands fringing her green shore
 From broad plantations where swart freemen bend
 Bronzed backs in willing labor from her store
 Of golden fruit from stream from town ascend
 Lifecurrents of pure health
 Her aims shall be subserved with boundless wealth


 Yet now how listless and how still she lies
 Like some halfsavage dusky Indian queen
 Rocked in her hammock neath her native skies
 With the pathetic passive broken mien
 Of one who sorely proved
 Greatsouled hath suffered much and much hath loved


 But look along the widebranched dewy glade
 Glimmers the dawn the light palmettotrees
 And cypresses reissue from the shade
 And SHE hath wakened Through clear air she sees
 The pledge the brightening ray
 And leaps from dreams to hail the coming day




SPRING STAR


 I


 Over the lamplit street
 Trodden by hurrying feet
 Where mostly pulse and beat
 Lifes throbbing veins
 See where the April star
 Bluebright as sapphires are
 Hangs in deep heavens far
 Waxes and wanes


 Strangely alive it seems
 Darting keen dazzling gleams
 Veiling anon its beams
 Large clear and pure
 In the broad western sky
 No orb may shine anigh
 No lesser radiancy
 May there endure


 Spring airs are blowing sweet
 Low in the dusky street
 Starbeams and eyebeams meet
 Rapt in his dreams
 All through the crowded mart
 Poet with swiftstirred heart
 Passing beneath must start
 Thrilled by those gleams


 Naught doth he note anear
 Fain through Nights veil to peer
 Reach that resplendent sphere
 Reading her sign
 Where point those sharp thin rays
 Guiding his weary maze
 Blesseth she or betrays
 Who may divine


 Guard me celestial light
 Lofty serenely bright
 Lead my halt feet aright
 Prayerful he speaks
 For a new ray hath shone
 Over my spirit lone
 Be this new soul the one
 whom my soul seeks




 II


 Beside her casement oped the maiden sits
 Where the mild evening spirit of the Spring
 Gently between the citys homesteads flits
 To kiss her brows and floats on languid wing
 Vague longings in her breast awakening
 While her heart trembles neath those dim deep skies
 As the quick sea that neath the globed moon lies


 Where her eyes rest the fullorbed evening star
 Burns with white flame it beckons shrinks dilates
 She dazzled by that shining world afar
 May not withdraw her gaze breathless she waits
 Some promised joy from Heavens very gates
 Unto her soul seems proffered When shall be
 The bright fulfilment of that stars decree


 Nor glad nor sad is she she doth not know
 That through the citys throng one threads his way
 Thrilled likewise by that planets mystic glow
 And hastes to seek her What sweet change shall sway
 Her spirit at his coming What new ray
 Upon his shadowy life from her shall fall
 The silent star burns on and knoweth all




A JUNE NIGHT


 Ten oclock the broken moon
 Hangs not yet a half hour high
 Yellow as a shield of brass
 In the dewy air of June
 Poised between the vaulted sky
 And the oceans liquid glass


 Earth lies in the shadow still
 Low black bushes trees and lawn
 Nights ambrosial dews absorb
 Through the foliage creeps a thrill
 Whispering of yon spectral dawn
 And the hidden climbing orb


 Higher higher gathering light
 Veiling with a golden gauze
 All the trembling atmosphere
 See the rayless disk grows white
 Hark the glittering billows pause

 Faint far sounds possess the ear


 Elves on such a night as this
 Spin their rings upon the grass
 On the beach the waterfay
 Greets her lover with a kiss
 Through the air swift spirits pass
 Laugh caress and float away


 Shut thy lids and thou shalt see
 Angel faces wreathed with light
 Mystic forms long vanished hence
 Ah too fine too rare they be
 For the grosser mortal sight
 And they foil our waking sense


 Yet we feel them floating near
 Know that we are not alone
 Though our open eyes behold
 Nothing save the moons bright sphere
 In the vacant heavens shown
 And the oceans path of gold




MAGNETISM


 By the impulse of my will
 By the red flame in my blood
 By me nerves electric thrill
 By the passion of my mood
 My concentrated desire
 My undying desperate love
 I ignore Fate I defy her
 Ironhearted Death I move
 When the town lies numb with sleep
 Here roundeyed I sit my breath
 Quickly stirred my flesh acreep
 And I force the gates of death
 I nor move nor speakyoud deem
 From my quiet face and hands
 I were trancedbut in her dream
 SHE responds she understands
 I have power on what is not
 Or on what has ceased to be
 From that deep earthhollowed spot
 I can lift her up to me
 And or ere I am aware
 Through the closed and curtained door
 Comes my lady white and fair
 And embraces me once more
 Though the clay clings to her gown
 Yet all heaven is in her eyes
 Cool kind fingers press mine eyes
 To my soul her soul replies
 But when breaks the common dawn
 And the city wakesbehold
 My shy phantom is withdrawn
 And I shiver lone and cold
 And I know when she has left
 She is stronger far than I
 And more subtly spun her weft
 Than my human wizardry
 Though I force her to my will
 By the red flame in my blood
 By my nerves electric thrill
 By the passion of my mood
 Yet all day a ghost am I
 Nerves unstrung spent will dull brain
 I achieve attain but die
 And she claims me hers again




AUGUST MOON


 Look the roundcheeked moon floats high
 In the glowing August sky
 Quenching all her neighbor stars
 Save the steady flame of Mars
 White as silver shines the sea
 Faroff sails like phantoms be
 Gliding oer that lake of light
 Vanishing in nether night
 Heavy hangs the tasseled corn
 Sighing for the cordial morn
 But the marshymeadows bare
 Love this spectrallighted air
 Drink the dews and lift their song
 Chirp of crickets all night long
 Earth and sea enchanted lie
 Neath that moonusurped sky


 To the faces of our friends
 Unfamiliar traits she lends
 Quaint white witch who looketh down
 With a glamour all her own
 Hushed are laughter jest and speech
 Mute and heedless each of each
 In the glory wan we sit
 Visions vague before us flit
 Side by side yet worlds apart
 Heart becometh strange to heart


 Slowly in a moved voice then
 Ralph the artist spake again
 Does not that weird orb unroll
 Scenes phantasmal to your soul
 As I gaze thereon I swear
 Peopled grows the vacant air
 Fables myths alone are real
 Whiteclad sylphlike figures steal
 Twixt the bushes oer the lawn
 Goddess nymph undine and faun
 Yonder see the Willis dance
 Faces pale with stony glance
 They are maids who died unwed
 And they quit their gloomy bed
 Hungry still for human pleasure
 Here to trip a moonlit measure
 Near the shore the mermaids play
 Floating on the cool white spray
 Leaping from the glittering surf
 To the dark and fragrant turf
 Where the frolic trolls and elves
 Daintily disport themselves
 All the shapes by poets brain
 Fashioned live for me again
 In this spiritual light
 Less than day yet more than night
 What a world a waking dream
 All things other than they seem
 Borrowing a finer grace
 From yon golden globe in space
 Touched with wild romantic glory
 Foliage fresh and billows hoary
 Hollows bathed in yellow haze
 Hills distinct and fields of maize
 Ancient legends come to mind
 Who would marvel should he find
 In the copse or nigh the spring
 Summer fairies gamboling
 Where the honeybees do suck
 Mab and Ariel and Puck
 Ah no modern mortal sees
 Creatures delicate as these
 All the simple faith has gone
 Which their world was builded on
 Now the moonbeams coldly glance
 On no gardens of romance
 To prosaic senses dull
 Baldurs dead the Beautiful
 Hark the cry rings overhead
 Universal Pan is dead
 Requiescant Claudes grave tone
 Thrilled us strangely I am one
 Who would not restore that Past
 Beauty will immortal last
 Though the beautiful must die
 This the ages verify
 And had Pan deserved the name
 Which his votaries misclaim
 He were living with us yet
 I behold without regret
 Beauty in new forms recast
 Truth emerging from the vast
 Bright and orbed like yonder sphere
 Making the obscure air clear
 He shall be of bards the king
 Who in worthy verse shall sing
 All the conquests of the hour
 Stealing no fictitious power
 From the classic types outworn
 But his rhythmic line adorn
 With the marvels of the real
 He the baseless feud shall heal
 That estrangeth wide apart
 Science from her sister Art
 Hold look through this glass for me
 Artist tell me what you see
 I cried Ralph I see in place
 Of Astartes silver face
 Or veiled Isis radiant robe
 Nothing but a rugged globe
 Seamed with awful rents and scars
 And below no longer Mars
 Fierce flamecrested god of war
 But a lurid flickering star
 Fashioned like our mother earth
 Vexed belike with death and birth


 Rapt in dreamy thought the while
 With a sphinxlike shadowy smile
 Poet Florio sat but now
 Spake in deepvoiced accents slow
 More as one who probes his mind
 Than for usWho seeks shall find
 Widening knowledge surely brings
 Vaster themes to him who sings
 Was veiled Isis more sublime
 Than yon frozen fruit of Time
 Hanging in the naked sky
 Deaths domainfor worlds too die
 Lo the heavens like a scroll
 Stand revealed before my soul
 And the hieroglyphs are suns
 Changeless change the law that runs
 Through the flameinscribed page
 World on world and age on age
 Balls of ice and orbs of fire
 What abides when these expire
 Through slow cycles they revolve
 Yet at last like clouds dissolve
 Jove Osiris Brahma pass
 Races wither like the grass
 Must not mortals be as gods
 To embrace such periods
 Yet at Natures heart remains
 One who waxes not nor wanes
 And our crowning glory still
 Is to have conceived his will




SUNRISE


 September 26 1881


 Weep for the martyr Strew his bier
 With the last roses of the year
 Shadow the land with sables knell
 The harshtongued melancholy bell
 Beat the dull muffled drum and flaunt
 The drooping banner let the chant
 Of the deepthroated organ sob
 One voice one sorrow one heartthrob
 From land to land from sea to sea
 The huge world quires his elegy
 Tears love and honor he shall have
 Through ages keeping green his grave
 Too late approved too early lost
 His story is the peoples boast
 Toughsinewed offspring of the soil
 Of peasant lineage reared to toil
 In Europe he had been a thing
 To the glebe tetheredhere a king
 Crowned not for some transcendent gift
 Genius of power that may lift
 A Caesar or a Bonaparte
 Up to the starred goal of his heart
 But that he was the epitome
 Of all the people aim to be
 Were they his dying trust He was
 No less their model and their glass
 In him the daily traits were viewed
 Of the undistinguished multitude
 Brave as the silent myriads are
 Crushed by the juggernaut worldcar
 Strong with the peoples strength yet mild
 Simple and tender as a child
 Wise with the wisdom of the heart
 Able in council field and mart
 Nor lacking in the lambent gleam
 The great souls final stampthe beam
 Of genial fun the humor sane
 Wherewith the hero sports with pain
 His virtues hold within the span
 Of his obscurest fellowman
 To live without reproach to die
 Without a fearin these words lie
 His highest aims for none too high
 No triumph his beyond the reach
 Of patient courage kindly speech
 And yet so brave the soul outbreathed
 The great example he bequeathed
 Were all to follow we should see
 A universal chivalry


 His trust the People They respond
 From Maine to Florida beyond
 The seawalled continents broad scope
 Honor his pledge confirm his hope
 Hark over seas the echo hence
 The nations do him reverence
 An Empress lays her votive wreath
 Where peoples weep with bated breath
 The worldclock strikes a fateful hour
 Bright with fair portents big with power
 The first since historys course has run
 When kings and peoples cause is one
 Those mourn a brotherthese a son


 O how he loved them That gray morn
 When his woundwasted form was borne
 North from the White House to the sea
 Lifting his tired lids thankfully
 How good he murmured in his pain
 To see the people once again
 Oh how they loved him They stood there
 Thronging the road the street the square
 With hushed lips locked in silent prayer
 Uncovered heads and streaming eyes
 Breathless as when a father dies
 The records of the ghostly ride
 Past town and field at morningtide


 When lifes full stream is wont to gush
 Through all its ways with boisterous rush
 The records note that once a hound
 Had barked and once was heard the sound
 Of cartwheels rumbling on the stones
 And once mid stifled sobs and groans
 One man dared audibly lament
 And cried God bless the president
 Always the waiting crowds to send
 A Godspeed to his journeys end
 The anxious whisper brow of gloom
 As in a sicknesssacred room
 Till his ear drank with ecstasy
 The rhythmic thunders of the sea


 Tears for the smitten fatherless
 The wifes the mothers lifedistress
 To whom the millionthroated moan
 From throne and hut may not atone
 For one hushed voice one empty chair
 One presence missing everywhere
 But only words of joy and sheer
 The people from his grave shall hear
 Were they not worthy of his trust
 From whose seed sprang the sacred dust
 He broke the bars that separate
 The humble from the high estate
 And heirs of empire round his bed
 Mourn with the disinherited


 Oh toilworn patient Heart that bleeds
 Whose martyrdom even his exceeds
 Wronged cursed despised misunderstood
 Oh allenduring multitude
 Rejoice amid you tears rejoice
 There issues from this grave a voice
 Proclaiming your long night is oer
 Your daydawn breaks from shore to shore
 You have redeemed his pledge remained
 Secure erect and selfsustained
 Holding more dear one thing alone
 Even than the blood of dearest son
 Revering with religious awe
 The inviolable might of Law




A MASQUE OF VENICE

 A Dream


 Not a stain
 In the sunbrimmed sapphire cup that is the sky
 Not a ripple on the black translucent lane
 Of the palacewalled lagoon
 Not a cry
 As the gondoliers with velvet oar glide by
 Through the golden afternoon


 From this height
 Where the carved ageyellowed balcony oerjuts
 Yonder liquid marble pavement see the light
 Shimmer soft beneath the bridge
 That abuts
 On a labyrinth of waterways and shuts
 Half their sky off with its ridge


 We shall mark
 All the pageant from this ivory porch of ours
 Masques and jesters mimes and minstrels while we hark
 To their music as they fare
 Scent their flowers
 Flung from boat to boat in rainbow radiant showers
 Through the laughterringing air


 See they come
 Like a flock of serpentthroated blackplumed swans
 With the mandoline viol and the drum
 Gems afire on arms ungloved
 Fluttering fans
 Floating mantles like a great moths streaky vans
 Such as Veronese loved


 But behold
 In their midst a white unruffled swan appear
 One strange barge that snowy tapestries enfold
 White its tasseled silver prow
 Who is here
 Prince of Love in masquerade or Prince of Fear
 Clad in glittering silken snow


 Cheek and chin
 Where the masks edge stops are of the hoarfrosts hue
 And no eyebeams seem to sparkle from within
 Where the hollow rings have place
 Yon gay crew
 Seem to fly him he seems ever to pursue
 T is our sport to watch the race


 At his side
 Stands the goldenest of beauties from her glance
 From her forehead shines the splendor of a bride
 And her feet seem shod with wings
 To entrance
 For she leaps into a wild and rhythmic dance
 Like Salome at the Kings


 T is his aim
 Just to hold to clasp her once against his breast
 Hers to flee him to elude him in the game
 Ah she fears him overmuch
 Is it jest
 Is it earnest a strange riddle lurks halfguessed
 In her horror of his touch


 For each time
 That his snowwhite fingers reach her fades some ray
 From the glory of her beauty in its prime
 And the knowledge grows upon us that the dance
 Is no play
 Twixt the pale mysterious lover and the fay
 But the whirl of fate and chance


 Where the tide
 Of the broad lagoon sinks plumb into the sea
 There the mystic gondolier hath won his bride
 Hark one helpless stifled scream
 Must it be
 Mimes and minstrels flowers and music where are ye
 Was all Venice such a dream




AUTUMN SADNESS


 Air and sky are swathed in gold
 Fold on fold
 Light glows through the trees like wine
 Earth sunquickened swoons for bliss
 Neath his kiss
 Breathless in a trance divine


 Nature pauses from her task
 Just to bask
 In these lulld transfigured hours
 The green leaf nor stays nor goes
 But it grows
 Royaler than midJunes flowers


 Such impassioned silence fills
 All the hills
 Burning with unflickering fire
 Such a bloodred splendor stains
 The leaves veins
 Life seems one fulfilled desire


 While earth sea and heavens shine
 Heart of mine
 Say what art thou waiting for
 Shall the cup neer reach the lip
 But still slip
 Till the lifelong thirst give oer


 Shall my soul no frosts may tame
 Catch new flame
 From the incandescent air
 In this nuptial joy apart
 Oh my heart
 Whither shall we lonely fare


 Seek some dusky twilight spot
 Quite forgot
 Of the Autumns Bacchic fire
 Where soft mists and shadows sleep
 There outweep
 Barren longings vain desire




SONNETS


 ECHOES


 Lateborn and womansouled I dare not hope
 The freshness of the elder lays the might
 Of manly modern passion shall alight
 Upon my Muses lips nor may I cope
 Who veiled and screened by womanhood must grope
 With the worlds strongarmed warriors and recite
 The dangers wounds and triumphs of the fight
 Twanging the fullstringed lyre through all its scope
 But if thou ever in some lakefloored cave
 Oerbrowed by hard rocks a wild voice wooed and heard
 Answering at once from heaven and earth and wave
 Lending elfmusic to thy harshest word
 Misprize thou not these echoes that belong
 To one in love with solitude and song




 SUCCESS


 Oft have I brooded on defeat and pain
 The pathos of the stupid stumbling throng
 These I ignore today and only long
 To pour my soul forth in one trumpet strain
 One clear griefshattering triumphant song
 For all the victories of mans high endeavor
 Palmbearing laureled deeds that live forever
 The splendor clothing him whose will is strong
 Hast thou beheld the deep glad eyes of one
 Who has persisted and achieved Rejoice
 On naught diviner shines the allseeing sun
 Salute him with free heart and choral voice
 Midst flippant feeble crowds of spectres wan
 The bold significant successful man




 THE NEW COLOSSUS


 Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame
 With conquering limbs astride from land to land
 Here at our seawashed sunset gates shall stand
 A mighty woman with a torch whose flame
 Is the imprisoned lightning and her name
 Mother of Exiles From her beaconhand
 Glows worldwide welcome her mild eyes command
 The airbridged harbor that twin cities frame
 Keep ancient lands your storied pomp cries she
 With silent lips Give me your tired your poor
 Your huddled masses yearning to be free
 The wretched refuse of your teeming shore
 Send these the homeless tempesttost to me
 I lift my lamp beside the golden door

 Written in aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund 1883




 VENUS OF THE LOUVRE


 Down the long hall she glistens like a star
 The foamborn mother of Love transfixed to stone
 Yet none the less immortal breathing on
 Times brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar
 When first the enthralled enchantress from afar
 Dazzled mine eyes I saw not her alone
 Serenely poised on her worldworshipped throne
 As when she guided once her dovedrawn car
 But at her feet a pale deathstricken Jew
 Her life adorer sobbed farewell to love
 Here Heine wept Here still we weeps anew
 Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move
 While mourns one ardent heart one poetbrain
 For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain




 CHOPIN


 I


 A dream of interlinking hands of feet
 Tireless to spin the unseen fairy woof
 Of the entangling waltz Bright eyebeams meet
 Gay laughter echoes from the vaulted roof
 Warm perfumes rise the soft unflickering glow
 Of branching lights sets off the changeful charms
 Of glancing gems rich stuffs dazzling snow
 Of necks unkerchieft and bare clinging arms
 Hark to the music How beneath the strain
 Of reckless revelry vibrates and sobs
 One fundamental chord of constant pain
 The pulsebeat of the poets heart that throbs
 So yearns though all the dancing waves rejoice
 The troubled seas disconsolate deep voice



 II


 Who shall proclaim the golden fable false
 Of Orpheus miracles This subtle strain
 Above our proseworlds sordid loss and gain
 Lightly uplifts us With the rhythmic waltz
 The lyric prelude the nocturnal song
 Of love and languor varied visions rise
 That melt and blend to our enchanted eyes
 The Polish poet who sleeps silenced long
 The seraphsouled musician breathes again
 Eternal eloquence immortal pain
 Revived the exalted face we know so well
 The illuminated eyes the fragile frame
 Slowly consuming with its inward flame
 We stir not speak not lest we break the spell



 III


 A voice was needed sweet and true and fine
 As the sad spirit of the evening breeze
 Throbbing with human passion yet divine
 As the wild birds untutored melodies
 A voice for him neath twilight heavens dim
 Who mourneth for his dead while round him fall
 The wan and noiseless leaves A voice for him
 Who sees the first green sprout who hears the call
 Of the first robin on the first spring day
 A voice for all whom Fate hath set apart
 Who still misprized must perish by the way
 Longing with love for that they lack the art
 Of their own souls expression For all these
 Sing the unspoken hope the vague sad reveries



 IV


 Then Nature shaped a poets hearta lyre
 From out whose chords the lightest breeze that blows
 Drew trembling music wakening sweet desire
 How shall she cherish him Behold she throws
 This precious fragile treasure in the whirl
 Of seething passions he is scourged and stung
 Must dive in stormvext seas if but one pearl
 Of art or beauty therefrom may be wrung
 No purebrowed pensive nymph his Muse shall be
 An amazon of thought with sovereign eyes
 Whose kiss was poison manbrained worldlywise
 Inspired that elfin delicate harmony
 Rich gain for us But with him is it well
 The poet who must sound earth heaven and hell




SYMPHONIC STUDIES


 After Robert Schumann


 Prelude


 Blue stormclouds in hot heavens of midJuly
 Hung heavy brooding over land and sea
 Our hearts atremble throbbed in harmony
 With the wild restless tone of air and sky
 Shall we not call him Prospero who held
 In his enchanted hands the fateful key
 Of that tempestuous hours mystery
 And with him to wander by a sunbright shore
 To hear fine fairy voices and to fly
 With disembodied Ariel once more
 Above earths wrack and ruin Far and nigh
 The laughter of the thunder echoed loud
 And harmless lightnings leapt from cloud to cloud



 I


 Floating upon a swelling wave of sound
 We seemed to overlook an endless sea
 Poised twixt clear heavens and glittering surf were we
 We drank the air in flight we knew no bound
 To the audacious ventures of desire
 Nigh us the sun was dropping drowned in gold
 Deep deep below the burning billows rolled
 And all the sea sang like a smitten lyre
 Oh the wild voices of those chanting waves
 The human faces glimpsed beneath the tide
 Familiar eyes gazed from profound seacaves
 And we exalted were as we had died
 We knew the sea was Life the harmonious cry
 The blended discords of humanity



 II


 Look deeper yet mark midst the waveblurred mass
 In lines distinct in colors clear defined
 The typic groups and figures of mankind
 Behold within the cool and liquid glass
 Bright childfolk sporting with smooth yellow shells
 Astride of dolphins leaping up to kiss
 Fair motherfaces From the vast abyss
 How joyously their thoughtfree laughter wells
 Lulled by the overwhelming waters sound
 And some make mouths at dragons undismayed
 Oh dauntless innocence The gulfs profound
 Reecho strangely with their ringing glee
 And with wise mermaids plaintive melody



 III


 What do the seanymphs in that coral cave
 With wondering eyes their supple forms they bend
 Oer something rarely beautiful They lend
 Their lithe white arms and through the golden wave
 They lift it tenderly Oh blinding sight
 A naked radiant goddess tranced in sleep
 Fulllimbed voluptuous neath the mantling sweep
 Of auburn locks that kiss her ankles white
 Upward they bear her chanting low and sweet
 The clinging waters part before their way
 Jewels of flame are dancing neath their feet
 Up in the sunshine in soft foam they lay
 Their precious burden and return forlorn
 Oh bliss oh anguish Mortals LOVE is born



 IV


 Hark from unfathomable deeps a dirge
 Swells sobbing through the melancholy air
 Where Love has entered Death is also there
 The wail outrings the chafed tumultuous surge
 Ocean and earth the illimitable skies
 Prolong one note a mourning for the dead
 The cry of souls not to be comforted
 What piercing music Funeral visions rise
 And send the hot tears raining down our cheek
 We see the silent grave upon the hill
 With its lone lilacbush O heart be still
 She will not rise she will not stir nor speak
 Surely the unreturning dead are blest
 Ring on sweet dirge and knell us to our rest



 V


 Upon the silver beach the undines dance
 With interlinking arms and flying hair
 Like polished marble gleam their limbs left bare
 Upon their virgin rites pale moonbeams glance
 Softer the music for their foambright feet
 Print not the moist floor where they trip their round
 Affrighted they will scatter at a sound
 Leap in their cool seachambers nimbly fleet
 And we shall doubt that we have ever seen
 While our sane eyes behold stray wreaths of mist
 Shot with faint colors by the moonrays kissed
 Floating snowsoft snowwhite where these had been
 Already look the wavewashed sands are bare
 And mocking laughter ripples through the air



 Epilogue


 Forth in the sunlit rainbathed air we stepped
 Sweet with the dripping grass and flowering vine
 And saw through irised clouds the pale sun shine
 Back oer the hills the rainmist slowly crept
 Like a transparent curtains slivery sheen
 And fronting us the painted bow was arched
 Whereunder the majestic cloudshapes marched
 In the wet yellow light the dazzling green
 Of lawn and bush and tree seemed stained with blue
 Our hearts oerflowed with peace With smiles we spake
 Of partings in the past of courage new
 Of high achievement of the dreams that make
 A wonder and a glory of our days
 And all lifes music but a hymn of praise




LONG ISLAND SOUND


 I see it as it looked one afternoon
 In Augustby a fresh soft breeze oerblown
 The swiftness of the tide the light thereon
 A faroff sail white as a crescent moon
 The shining waters with pale currents strewn
 The quiet fishing smacks the Eastern cove
 The semicircle of its dark green grove
 The luminous grasses and the merry sun
 In the grave sky the sparkle far and wide
 Laughter of unseen children cheerful chirp
 Of crickets and low lisp of rippling tide
 Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep
 Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon
 All these fair sounds and sights I made my own




DESTINY


 1856


 Paris from throats of iron silver brass
 Joythundering cannon blent with chiming bells
 And martial strains the fullvoiced paean swells
 The air is starred with flags the chanted mass
 Throngs all the churches yet the broad streets swarm
 With gladeyed groups who chatter laugh and pass
 In holiday confusion class with class
 And over all the spring the sunfloods warm
 In the Imperial palace that March morn
 The beautiful young mother lay and smiled
 For by her side just breathed the Prince her child
 Heir to an empire to the purple born
 Crowned with the Titans name that stirs the heart
 Like a blown clarionone more Bonaparte


 1879


 Born to the purple lying stark and dead
 Transfixed with poisoned spears beneath the sun
 Of brazen Africa Thy grave is one
 Forefated youth on whom were visited
 Follies and sins not thine whereat the world
 Heartless howeer it be will pause to sing
 A dirge to breathe a sigh a wreath to fling
 Of rosemary and rue with bayleaves curled
 Enmeshed in toils ambitious not thine own
 Immortal loved boyPrince thou takst thy stand
 With early doomed Don Carlos hand in hand
 With mildbrowed Arthur Geoffreys murdered son
 Louis the Dauphin lifts his thornringed head
 And welcomes thee his brother mongst the dead




FROM ONE AUGUR TO ANOTHER


 So Calchas on the sacred Palatine
 Thou thought of Mopsus and oer wastes of sea
 A flower brought your message I divine
 Through my deep art the kindly mockery
 That played about your lips and in your eyes
 Plucking the frail leaf while you dreamed of home
 Thanks for the silent greeting I shall prize
 Beyond Junes rose the scentless flower of Rome
 All the Campagna spreads before my sight
 The mouldering wall the Caesars tombs unwreathed
 Rome and the Tiber and the yellow light
 Wherein the honeycolored blossom breathed
 But most I thank itegoists that we be
 For proving then and there you thought of me




THE CRANES OF IBYCUS


 There was a man who watched the river flow
 Past the huge town one gray November day
 Round him in narrow highpiled streets at play
 The boys made merry as they saw him go
 Murmuring halfloud with eyes upon the stream
 The immortal screed he held within his hand
 For he was walking in an April land
 With Faust and Helen Shadowy as a dream
 Was the proseworld the river and the town
 Wild joy possessed him through enchanted skies
 He saw the cranes of Ibycus swoop down
 He closed the page he lifted up his eyes
 Loa black line of birds in wavering thread
 Bore him the greetings of the deathless dead




CRITIC AND POET


 An Apologue


 Poetry must be simple sensuous or impassioned
 this man is neither simple sensuous nor impassioned
 therefore he is not a poet


 No man had ever heard a nightingale
 When once a keeneyed naturalist was stirred
 To study and definewhat is a bird
 To classify by rote and book nor fail
 To mark its structure and to note the scale
 Whereon its song might possibly be heard
 Thus far no fartherso he spake the word
 When of a suddenhark the nightingale


 Oh deeper higher than he could divine
 That allunearthly untaught strain He saw
 The plain brown warbler unabashed Not mine
 He cried the error of this fatal flaw
 No bird is this it soars beyond my line
 Were it a bird t would answer to my law




ST MICHAELS CHAPEL


 When the vexed hubbub of our world of gain
 Roars round about me as I walk the street
 The myriad noise of Traffic and the beat
 Of Toils incessant hammer the fierce strain
 Of struggle hand to hand and brain to brain
 Ofttimes a sudden dream my sense will cheat
 The gaudy shops the skypiled roofs retreat
 And all at once I stand enthralled again
 Within a marble minster overseas
 I watch the solemn goldstained gloom that creeps
 To kiss an alabaster tomb where sleeps
 A lady twixt two knights stone effigies
 And every day in dusky glory steeps
 Their sculptured slumber of five centuries




LIFE AND ART


 Not while the fever of the blood is strong
 The heart throbs loud the eyes are veiled no less
 With passion than with tears the Muse shall bless
 The poetsoul to help and soothe with song
 Not then she bids his trembling lips express
 The aching gladness the voluptuous pain
 Life is his poem then flesh sense and brain
 One fullstringed lyre attuned to happiness
 But when the dream is done the pulses fail
 The days illusion with the days sun set
 He lonely in the twilight sees the pale
 Divine Consoler featured like Regret
 Enter and clasp his hand and kiss his brow
 Then his lips ope to singas mine do now




SYMPATHY


 Therefore I dare reveal my private woe
 The secret blots of my imperfect heart
 Nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert
 Nor beautify nor hide For this I know
 That even as I am thou also art
 Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go
 To pause and bide with me to whisper low
 Not I alone am weak not I apart
 Must suffer struggle conquer day by day
 Here is my very cross by strangers borne
 Here is my bosomsun wherefrom I pray
 Hourly deliverancethis my rose my thorn
 This woman my souls need can understand
 Stretching oer silent gulfs her sister hand




YOUTH AND DEATH


 What hast thou done to this dear friend of mine
 Thou cold white silent Stranger From my hand
 Her clasped hand slips to meet the grasp of thine
 Here eyes that flamed with love at thy command
 Stare stoneblank on blank air her frozen heart
 Forgets my presence Teach me who thou art
 Vague shadow sliding twixt my friend and me
 I never saw thee till this sudden hour
 What secret door gave entrance unto thee
 What power in thine oermastering Loves own power




AGE AND DEATH


 Come closer kind white longfamiliar friend
 Embrace me fold me to thy broad soft breast
 Life has grown strange and cold but thou dost bend
 Mild eyes of blessing wooing to my rest
 So often hast thou come and from my side
 So many hast thou lured I only bide
 Thy beck to follow glad thy steps divine
 Thy world is peopled for me this worlds bare
 Through all these years my couch thou didst prepare
 Thou art supreme Lovekiss meI am thine




CITY VISIONS


 I


 As the blind Miltons memory of light
 The deaf Beethovens phantasy of tone
 Wrought joys for them surpassing all things known
 In our restricted sphere of sound and sight
 So while the glaring streets of brick and stone
 Vex with heat noise and dust from morn till night
 I will give rein to Fancy taking flight
 From dismal now and here and dwell alone
 With newenfranchised senses All day long
 Think ye t is I who sit twixt darkened walls
 While ye chase beauty over land and sea
 Uplift on wings of some rare poets song
 Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls
 I soar cloudhigh free as the the winds are free



 II


 Who grasps the substance who mid shadows strays
 He who within some darkbright wood reclines
 Twixt sleep and waking where the needled pines
 Have cushioned all his couch with soft brown sprays
 He notes not how the living water shines
 Trembling along the cliff a flickering haze
 Brimming a winebright pool nor lifts his gaze
 To read the ancient wonders and the signs
 Does he possess the actual or do I
 Who paint on air more than his sense receives
 The glittering pinetufts with closed eyes behold
 Breathe the strong resinous perfume see the sky
 Quiver like azure flame between the leaves
 And open unseen gates with key of gold




INFLUENCE


 The fervent palefaced Mother ere she sleep
 Looks out upon the zigzaglighted square
 The beautiful bare trees the blue nightair
 The revelation of the starstrewn deep
 World above world and heaven over heaven
 Between the treetops and the skies her sight
 Rests on a steadfast ruddyshining light
 High in the tower an earthly star of even
 Hers is the faith in saints and angels power
 And mediating loveshe breathes a prayer
 For yon tired watcher in the gray old tower
 He the shrewd skeptic poet unaware
 Feels comforted and stilled and knows not whence
 Falls this unwonted peace on heart and sense




RESTLESSNESS


 Would I had waked this morn where Florence smiles
 Abloom with beauty a white rose fullblown
 Yet rich in sacred dust in storied stone
 Precious past all the wealth of Indian isles
 From olivehoary Fiesole to feed
 On Brunelleschis dome my hungry eye
 And see against the lotuscolored sky
 Spring the slim belfry graceful as a reed
 To kneel upon the ground where Dante trod
 To breathe the air of immortality
 From Angelo and RaphaelTO BE
 Each sense newquickened by a demigod
 To hear the liquid Tuscan speech at whiles
 From citizen and peasant to behold
 The heaven of Leonardo washed with gold
 Would I had waked this morn where Florence smile

ACT I

 SCENE I

 The studio of the Spagnoletto RIBERA at work before his canvas
 MARIA seated some distance behind him a piece of embroidery is
 in her hands but she glances up from it incessantly toward her
 father with impatient movements


 MARIA
 Father
 RIBERA absorbed in his work makes no reply she puts by her
 embroidery goes toward him and kisses him gently He starts
 looks up at her and returns her caress


 RIBERA
 My child


 MARIA
 Already you forget
 Oh heedless father Did you not promise me
 To lay aside your brush today at noon
 And tell me the great secret


 RIBERA
 Ah t is true
 I am to blame But it is morning yet
 My child wait still a little


 MARIA
 T is morning yet
 Nay it was noon one mortal hour ago
 All patience I have sat till you should turn
 And beckon me The rosy angels breathe
 Upon the canvas I might sit till night
 And if I spake not you would never glance
 From their celestial faces Dear my father
 Your brow is moist and yet your hands are ice
 Your very eyes are tiredpray rest awhile
 The Spagnoletto need no longer toil
 As in the streets of Rome for beggars fare
 Now princes bide his pleasure


 RIBERA throws aside his brush and palette
 Ah Maria
 Thou speakst in season Let me neer forget
 Those days of degradation when I starved
 Before the gates of palaces The germs
 Stirred then within me of the perfect fruits
 Wherewith my hands have since enriched Gods world
 Vengeance I vowed for every moments sting
 Vengeance on wealth rank station fortune genius
 See while I paint all else escapes my sense
 Save this bright throng of phantasies that press
 Upon my brain each claiming from my hand
 Its immortality But thou my child
 Remindst me of mine oath my sacred pride
 The eternal hatred lodged within my breast
 Philip of Spain shall wait I will not deign
 To add today the final touch of life
 Unto this masterpiece


 MARIA
 So that is well
 Put by the envious brush that separates
 Father from daughter Now you are all mine own
 And nowyour secret


 RIBERA
 Mine T is none of mine
 T is thine Maria John of Austria
 Desires our presence at his ball tonight


 MARIA
 Prince John


 RIBERA
 Ay girl Prince John I looked to see
 A haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyes
 And burn upon thy cheek But what is this
 Timid and pale thou droopst thy head abashed
 As a poor flowergirl whom a lord accosts


 MARIA
 Forgive me Sure t is you Don John desires
 The prince of artists


 RIBERA
 Art Prate not of art
 Thinkst thou I move an artist midst his guests
 As such I commune with a loftier race
 Angels and spirits are my ministers
 These do I part aside to grace his halls
 A Spanish gentlemanand so his peer


 MARIA
 Father I am not well my head throbs fast
 Unwonted languor weighs upon my frame


 RIBERA
 Anger me not Maria T is my will
 Thou shalt obey Hell what these women be
 No obstacle would daunt them in the quest
 Of that which freely given they reject
 Hold Haply just occasion bids thee seem
 Unlike thyself Speak fearlessly child
 Confide to me thy knowledge thy surmise


 MARIA hurriedly
 No father you were right I have no cause
 Punish menay forgive and I obey


 RIBERA
 There spake my child kiss me and be forgiven
 Sometimes I doubt thou playest upon my love
 Willfully knowing me as soft as clay
 Whom the world knows of marble In such moods
 I see my spirit mirrors first and then
 From thy large eyes thy sainted mothers soul
 Unclouded shine


 MARIA
 Can I be like to her
 I only knew her faded white and grave
 And so she still floats vaguely through my dreams
 With eyes like your own angels and a brow
 Worthy an aureole


 RIBERA
 An earthly crown
 My princess might more fitly rest on thine
 Annicca hath her colors blueblack hair
 And pale brown flesh and gray untroubled eyes
 Yet thou more often bringst her to mind
 For all the tawny gold of thy thick locks
 Thy rare white face and brilliant Spanish orbs
 Thine is her lisping trick of voice her laugh
 The blithest music still this side of heaven
 Thine her free springing gait though therewithal
 A swaying languid motion all thine own
 Recalls Valencia more than Italy
 Like and unlike thou art to her as still
 My memory loves to hold her as she first
 Beamed like the star of morning on my life
 Hot faint and footsore I had paced since dawn
 The sunbaked streets of Naples seeking work
 Not alms despite the beggar that I looked
 Now t was nigh vespers and my suit had met
 With curt refusal sharp rebuff and gibes
 Praised be the saints for every drop of gall
 In that days brimming cup I have upheld
 A poisoned beaker to anothers lips
 Many a one hath the Ribera taught
 To fare a vagabond through alien streets
 A god unrecognized midst churls and clowns
 With kindled soul aflame and body faint
 Or lack of bread Domenichino knows
 And Gessi Guido Annibal Caracci


 MARIA
 Dear father calm yourself You had begun
 To tell me how you saw my mother first


 RIBERA
 True I forgot it not Why I AM calm
 The old man now can well be grave and cold
 Or laugh at his own youths indignities
 Past a long lifetime back T was vespers hour
 Or nigh it when I reached her fathers door
 Kind was his greeting the first cordial words
 I heard in Naples but I took small heed
 Of speech or toe for all my sense was rapt
 In wonder at the angel by his side
 Who smiled upon me Large clear eyes that held
 The very soul of sunlight in their depths
 Low pure pale brow with masses of black hair
 Flung loosely back and rippling unconfined
 In shadowy magnificence below
 The slim gold girdle oer the snowsoft gown
 Vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists
 A stately lily ere the dew of morn
 Hath passed awaysuch was thy mother child


 MARIA
 Would I were like her But what said she father
 How did she plead for you


 RIBERA
 Ah cunning child
 I see thy tricks thou humorest my age
 Knowing how much I love to tell this tale
 Though thou hast heard it half a hundred times


 MARIA
 I find it sweet to hear as you to tell
 Believe me father


 RIBERA
 T was to pleasure her
 Signor Cortese gave me all I lacked
 To prove my unfamed skill A savage pride
 Matched oddly with my rags the haughtiness
 Wherewith I claimed rather than begged my tools
 And my quaint aspect oft she told me since
 Won at a glance her faith Before I left
 She guessed my need and served me meat and wine
 With her own flowerwhite hands The parting grace
 I craved was granted that my work might be
 The portrait of herself Thou knowest the rest


 MARIA
 Why did she leave us father Oh how oft
 I yearn to see her face to hear her voice
 Hushed in an endless silence Strange that she
 Whose rich love beggared our return should bear
 Such separation Though engirdled now
 By heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim
 I cannot fancy it What shall her child
 Whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart
 Have need of her and cry to her in vain


 RIBERA
 Now for Gods sake Maria speak not thus
 Let me not see such tears upon thy cheek
 Not unto us it has been given to guess
 The peace of disembodied souls like hers
 The vanishing glimpses that my fancies catch
 Through heavens halfopened gates exalt even me
 Poor sinner that I am And what are these
 The painted shadows that make all my life
 A glory to the splendor of that light
 For thee my child has not my doting love
 Sufficed at least in part to fill the breach
 Of that tremendous void What dost thou lack
 What help what counsel what most dear caress
 What dost thou covet What least whim remains
 Ungratified because not yet expressed


 MARIA
 None none dear father Pardon me Thy love
 Generous and wise as tender shames my power
 To merit or repay Fie o my lips
 Look if they be not blistered Let them smooth
 With contrite kisses the last frown away
 We must be young tonightno wrinkles then
 Genius must show immortal as she is


 RIBERA
 Thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways
 I had forgot the ball Yea I grow old
 This scanty mornings work has wearied me
 Once I had thought it play to dream all day
 Before my canvas and then dance till dawn
 And now must I give oer and rest at noon
 Rises

 Enter LUCA ushering in LORENZO who carries a portfolio


 LUCA
 Signor Lorenzo
 LORENZO ceremoniously salutes RIBERA and MARIA Exit LUCA


 LORENZO
 Master I bring my sketch
 Opens his portfolio and hands a sketch to RIBERA


 RIBERA
 Humph the design is not so illconceived
 I note some progress but your drawings bad
 Yes bad sir Mark you how this leg hangs limp
 As though devoid of life these hands seem clenched
 Not loosely clasped as you intended them
 He takes his pencil and makes a few strokes
 Thus should it standa single line will mend
 And here whats this Why t is a slovens work
 You dance too many nights away young gallant
 You shirk close labor as do all your mates
 You think to win with service frivolous
 Snatched twixt your cups or set between two kisses
 The favor of the mistress of the world


 LORENZO
 Your pardon master but you do me wrong
 Mayhap I lack the gift Alas I fear it
 But not the patience not the energy
 Of earnest indefatigable toil
 That help to make the artist


 RIBERA
 S death He dares
 Belie me and deny the testimony
 Of his own handiwork whose every line
 Betrays a sluggard soul an indolent will
 A brain thats bred to idleness So be it
 Master Lorenzo tells the Spagnoletto
 His own defects and qualities T were best
 He find another teacher competent
 To guide so apt so diligent a scholar


 MARIA
 Dear father what hath given thee offence
 Cast but another glance upon the sketch
 Surely it hath some grace some charm some promise


 RIBERA
 Daughter stand by I know these insolent slips
 Of young nobility they lack the stuff
 That makes us artists What to answer me
 When next I drop a hint as to his colors
 The lengthening or the shortening of a stroke
 Hell bandy words with me about his error
 To prove himself the master


 LORENZO
 If my defect
 Be an hereditary grain i the blood
 Even as you say I must abide by it
 But if patrician habits more than birth
 Beget such faults then may I dare to hope
 Not mine I knew I felt to clear new paths
 To win new kingdoms yet were I content
 With such achievement as a strenuous will
 A firm endeavor unfaltering love
 And an unwearying spirit might attain
 Cast me not lightly back Banish me not
 From this my home of hope of inspiration


 MARIA
 What my ungentle father Will you hear
 And leave this worthy signors suit unanswered


 RIBERA
 Well he may bide Sir I will speak with you
 Anon upon this work I judged in haste
 Yea it hath merit I am weary now
 Tomorrow I shall be in fitter mood
 To give you certain hints
 LORENZO bows his thanks and advances to address MARIA RIBERA
 silences and dismisses him with a wave of the hand Exit LORENZO


 RIBERA
 Should I oersleep
 Mine hour Maria thou must awaken me
 But come what may I will be fresh tonight
 To triumph in thy triumph
 Exit RIBERA


 MARIA alone
 Could I have told
 Then when he bade me Nay what is to tell
 He had flouted me for prizing at such height
 Homage so slight from John of Austria even
 A glance exchanged a smile a fallen flower
 Dropped from my hair and pressed against his lips
 The Prince my father gloats upon that name
 Were he no more than gentleman I think
 I should be glad I cannot tell today
 If I be sad or gay Now could I weep
 Warm longing tears anon a fire of joy
 Leaps in my heart and dances through my veins
 Why should I nurse such idle thoughts Tonight
 We are to meet again Will he remember
 Nay how should he forget His heart is young
 His eyes do mirror loyalty Oh day
 Quicken thy dull slow round of tedious hours
 God make me beautiful this happy night
 My fathers sleeping saint rebukes my thought
 Strange he has left his work against his wont
 Revealed before completed I will draw
 The curtain
 She stands irresolute before the picture with her hand on the
 curtain
 Beautiful oh beautiful
 The far bright opened heavensthe dark earth
 Where the tranced pilgrim lies with eyelids sealed
 His calm face flushed with comfortable sleep
 His weary limbs relaxed his heavy head
 Pillowed upon the stone Oh blessed dream
 That visits his rapt sense of airy forms
 Mounting descending on the shining ladder
 With messages of peace I will be true
 Unto my lineage divine and breathe
 The passion of just pride that overfills
 HIS soul inspired

 While she stands before the canvas reenter unperceived by
 her LORENZO


 LORENZO
 Oh celestial vision
 What brush may reproduce those magic tints
 Those lines ethereal


 MARIA turns suddenly
 Is it not marvellous
 Signor Lorenzo I would draw the curtain
 But gazing I forgot
 You are the first
 After the master and myself to look
 Upon this wonder


 LORENZO with enthusiasm looking for he first time at the picture
 Ah what an answer this
 For envious minds that would restrict his power
 To writhing limbs and shrivelled flesh Repose
 Beauty and large simplicity are here
 Yes that is art Before such work I stand
 And feel myself a dwarf


 MARIA
 There you are wrong
 My father even who knows his proper worth
 Before his best achievements I have seen
 In like dejection t is the curse of genius
 Oft have I heard the master grace your name
 With flattering addition


 LORENZO
 T is your goodness
 And not the echo of his praise that speaks
 My work was worthlesst was your generous voice
 Alone secured the masters second glance


 MARIA
 Nay signor frankly he esteems your talent
 Because you are of wellassured means
 And gentle birth he will be rude to you
 Not without base is the deep grudge he owes
 To riches and prosperity


 LORENZO
 Signora
 Why do I bear such harsh injurious terms
 As he affronts me with Why must I seem
 In mine own eyes a craven Spiritless
 Dishonorably patient T is not his fame
 His power his gift his venerable years
 That bind me here his willing slave Maria
 T is thou t is thou alone T is that I love thee
 And exile hence is death
 A pause He kneels at her feet She looks at him kindly but
 makes no reply
 At thy dear feet
 I lay my life with its most loyal service
 The subject of thy pleasure


 MARIA tenderly
 You are too humble


 LORENZO
 Too humble Do you seek mine utter ruin
 With words whose very tone is a caress
 I say all I love youyou have known it
 Why should I tell you Yet today you seem
 Other than you have been A milder light
 Beams from your eyesa gentler grace is throned
 Upon your browyour words fall soft as dew
 To melt my fixed resolve


 MARIA
 You find me signor
 In an unguarded mood I would be true
 To you and to myself yet know no answer
 Anon I will be calm pray you withdraw


 LORENZO
 Till when Remember what mad hopes and fears
 Meantime will riot in my brain


 MARIA
 Tomorrow
 Farewell farewell


 LORENZO kisses her hand
 Farewell
 Exit


 MARIA
 A faithful heart
 A name untainted a fair homeyea these
 Are what I need Oh lily soul in heaven
 Who wast on earth my mother guide thy child

 While MARIA sits rapt in thought enter from behind her ANNICCA
 who bends over her and kisses her brow


 ANNICCA
 What sister lost in dreams by daylight Fie
 Who is the monarch of thy thoughts


 MARIA starting
 Annicca
 My thoughts are bounden to no master yet
 They fly from earth to heaven in a breath
 Now are they all of earth Hast heard the tidings


 ANNICCA
 Yeaof the Princes ball We go together
 Braid in thy hair our mothers pearls and wear
 The amulet ingemmed with eastern stones
 T will bring good fortune


 MARIA
 Tell me ere we go
 What manner of man is John of Austria


 ANNICCA
 Scarce man at alla madcap charming boy
 Wellfavoredyou have seen himexquisite
 In courtly compliment of simple manners
 You may not hear a merrier laugh than his
 From any boatman on the bay wellversed
 In all such arts as most become his station
 Light in the dance as wingedfoot Mercury
 Eloquent on the zither and a master
 Of rapier and


 MARIA
 A puppet could be made
 To answer in all points your praise of him
 Hath he no substance as of a man


 ANNICCA
 Why sister
 What may that be to us


 MARIA
 He is our Prince


 ANNICCA
 The promise of his youth is to outstrip
 The hero of Lepanto bright and bold
 As fire he is the very soul the star
 Of Spanish chivalry his last achievement
 Seems still the flower of his accomplishments
 Musician soldier courtier yea and artist
 He had been a painter were he not a prince
 Says Messer Zurbaran The Calderona
 His actressmother hath bequeathed to him
 Her spirit with her beauty and the power
 To win and hold mens hearts


 MARIA
 I knew it sister
 His eye hath a command in it his brow
 Seems garlanded with laurel


 ANNICCA
 What is this
 You kindle with his praise your whole heart glows
 In light and color on your face your words
 Take wing and fly as bold as reckless birds
 What can so rash a thought a dream so wild
 So hopeless an ambition tempt your soul


 MARIA
 Pray you what thought what dream and what ambition
 I knew not I had uttered any such


 ANNICCA
 Nor have you in your speech your eyes now veiled
 Where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame
 Your blushes and your pallor have betrayed
 That which should lie uncounted fathom deep
 The secret of a womans foolish heart


 MARIA
 And there it lies my sibyl sister still
 Your plummet hath not reached it Yes t is love
 Flaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek
 And quickens my lame speechbut not for him
 Not for the Princeso may I vaunt his worth
 With a free soul


 ANNICCA
 Say on


 MARIA
 A gentleman
 Favored of earth and heaven true and loving
 Hath cast his heart at my imperial feet
 And if tomorrow find me as today
 I will een stoop and raise it to mine own


 ANNICCA
 Signor Vitruvio


 MARIA
 Not he indeed
 Did not I say favored of earth and heaven
 That should mean other gifts than bags of gold
 Or a straightfeatured mask Nor will it be
 Any you name though you should name him right
 Must it not liehow many fathom deep
 The secret of a womans foolish heart


 ANNICCA
 Kiss me Maria You are still a child
 You cannot vex me wilful as you be
 Your choice I fear not doubtless t will prove wise
 Despite your wild wit for your heart is pure
 And you will pause with sure deliberate judgment
 Before you leave our father


 MARIA
 Does love steal
 So gently oer our soul What if he come
 A cloud a fire a whirlwind to oerbear
 The feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him
 And blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason
 Fear not Annicca for in no such guise
 He visits my calm breast but yet you speak
 Somewhat too sagely Did such cautious wisdom
 Guide your own fancy


 ANNICCA
 Jest no more Maria
 Since I became a wife is much made clear
 Which a brief year ago was dark and vague
 Tommaso loves mewe are happier
 Then I had dreamed yet matching now with then
 I see his love is not that large rich passion
 Our father bore us


 MARIA
 You regret your home


 ANNICCA
 No no I have no wish and no regret
 I speak for you His is a sovereign soul
 And all his passions loom in huger shape
 Than lesser mens He brooks no rivalry
 With his own offspring and toward me his love
 Hath ebbed I mark to a more even flow
 While deeper stronger sets the powerful current
 Toward you alone Consider this Maria
 Nor wantonly discrown that sacred head
 Of your young love to wreathe some curled boys brow


 MARIA
 Think you his wish were that I should not wed


 ANNICCA
 Nay that I say not for his pride aspires
 To see you nobly mated


 MARIA after a pause
 Him will I wed
 Whose name is ancient fair and honorable
 As the Riberas is illustrious
 Him who no less than I will venerate
 That white divine old head In art his pupil
 In love his son tender as I to watch
 And to delay the slow extinguishing
 Of that great light


 ANNICCA
 There spake his darling child


 MARIA
 What ist oclock If he should sleep too late
 He bade me rouse him


 ANNICCA
 Haste to seek him then
 T is hard on sunset and he looks for thee
 With his first waking motion Till tonight
 Exeunt severally



 SCENE II

 A hall in RIBERAS house Enter LUCA and FIAMETTA


 FIAMETTA
 But did you see her


 LUCA
 Nay I saw her sister Donna Annicca


 FIAMETTA
 Tush man never name her beside my lady MariaRosa You have lost
 the richest feast in the world for hungry eyes Her gown of cloth
 o silver clad her as it were with light there twinkled about
 her waist a girdle stiff with stonesyou would have said they
 breathed Mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair
 and pearls again were clasped around her throat But no I might
 tell thee every ornamenther jeweled fan her comb of pearls her
 floating veil of gauze and still the best of all would escape us


 LUCA
 Thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden


 FIAMETTA
 Thou knowest not woman truly for all thy wit I speak most like a
 woman when I weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel Heighho
 I have felt the need of this Thou good Luca who might have
 been my father canst understand me HE was poor as thou Why
 shouldst thou be his lackey his slave My hand were as dainty as
 hers if it could but be spared its daily labor


 LUCA
 Yes poor child I understand thee and yet thou art wrong He is
 more slave to pride than I am to him I know him well Fiametta
 after so many years of service and today I pity him more than I
 fear him Why girl my task is sport beside his toil If my
 limbs be weary I sleep but I have seen him sit before his canvas
 with straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow When
 at last he gave oer and I have smoothed his pillow and served
 and soothed him what sleep could he snatch His brain is haunted
 with evil visions whereof some be merely of his own imaginings
 and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived and
 who rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse God only knows If
 that be geniusto be alive to pain at every pore to be possessed
 of a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space between
 the hours of grinding toilI thank the saints I am a simple man


 FIAMETTA
 I grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him he hath indeed a
 strange sour mien I shudder when he turns suddenly as his wont
 is and bends his evil eyes on me The holy father tells me such
 warnings come from God No matter how slight the service he asks
 of me my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move till I have
 whispered an Ave But what of Lady MariaRosa Both heaven and
 earth smile upon her Tonight she wears a poor girls dowry a
 separate fortune on her head her neck her hands yes on her
 little jeweled feet One tiny shoe of hers would make me free to
 wed my lad


 LUCA
 If he have but eyes I warrant thee he finds jewels enough in thy
 bright face Tell me his name


 FIAMETTA
 Nay that is my secret


 LUCA
 He must be a poorsouled lad if he will wait till thou hast earned
 a dowry


 FIAMETTA
 A poorsouled lad my good Vicenzoah but no matter thou knowest
 him Luca my Lord Lorenzos page Thereis he poor or mean or
 plain or dull He claims no dowry hebut I have my pride as well
 as the great ones


 LUCA
 May the saints preserve thee from such as theirs I am heartily glad
 of thy good fortune I am not sure whether thou or Lady MarieRosa
 be the most favored Well the end proves all
 Exeunt

 Enter on one side ANNICCA and DON TOMMASO attired for the ball
 on the other side RIBERA


 RIBERA
 What do ye here my children Haste away
 Maria waits you for the ball folk say
 T will be the bravest show eer seen in Naples
 I warrant you the Spagnoletto brings
 The richest jewelswhat sayst thou my son


 DON TOMMASO
 I who have robbed you of one gem need scarce
 Reword sir how I prize it


 RIBERA
 Why t is true
 Robbed me thou sayst So hast thou She was mine
 The balanced beauty of her flesh and spirit
 That was my garland and I was her all
 Till thou a stranger stole her hearts allegiance
 SubornedForgive me I am old a father
 Whose doting passions blind I am not jealous
 Believe me sir When we Riberas give
 We give without retraction or reserve
 Were it our lifeblood I rejoice with thee
 That she is thine nor am I quite bereft
 I have some treasure still I do repent
 So heartily of my discourteous speech
 That I will crave your leave before I kiss
 Your wifes soft palm


 ANNICCA kissing him repeatedly
 Why father what is this
 Can Don Tommasos wife so soon forget
 She is the Spagnolettos child


 RIBERA
 Enough
 I can bear praise thou knowest from all save thee
 And my Maria My grave son I fear
 Will mock these transports Pray go in with me
 No one of us but has this night a triumph
 Let us make ready
 Exeunt




ACT II

 SCENE I

 Ball in the Palace of DON JOHN Dance DON JOHN and MARIA
 together DON TOMMASO ANNICCA LORDS and LADIES dancing or
 promenading


 1st LORD
 Were it not better to withdraw awhile
 After our dance unto the torchlit gardens
 The air is fresh and sweet without


 1st LADY
 Nay signor
 I like this heavy air rich with warm odors
 The broad clear light the manycolored throng
 I might have breathed on mine own balcony
 The evening breeze


 1st LORD
 Still at cross purposes
 When will you cease to flout me


 1st LADY
 When I prize
 A lovers sigh more dear than mine own pleasure
 See the Signora Julia passed again
 She is far too pale for so much white I find
 Donna Auroraah how beautiful
 That spreading ruff sprinkled with seeds of gold
 Becomes her well Would you believe it sir
 Folk say her face is twin to minewhat think you


 1st LORD
 For me the huge earth holds but one such face
 You know it well


 1St LADY
 The hall is overfilled
 Go we without
 They pass on


 2d LADY
 Thrice he hath danced with her
 She is not one of usher face is strange
 Colored and carven to meet most mens desire
 Ist not my lord Certes it loses naught
 For lack of ornament Pray ask her name
 If but for my sake


 2d LORD
 I have already asked
 She is the daughter to the Spagnoletto
 MariaRosa


 2d LADY
 Ah I might have guessed
 The form and face are matched with the apparel
 As in a picture T was the masters hand
 I warrant you arranged with such quaint art
 Such seemingcareless care the dead white pearls
 Within her odd bright hair
 They pass on


 DON JOHN
 Now hope now fear
 Reigned lord of my wild dreams One name still sang
 Like the repeated strain of some caged bird
 Its sweet persistent music through my brain
 One vanishing face upon the empty air
 Shone forth and faded night and day And you
 Did you not find me hasty overbold
 Nay tell me all your thought


 MARIA
 You know my lord
 I am no courtier and belike my thought
 Might prove too rustic for a royal ear


 DON JOHN
 Speak on speak on
 Though you should rail your voice would still outsing
 Rebeck and mandoline


 MARIA
 Is it not strange
 I knew you not albeit I might have guessed
 If only from the simple garb of black
 And golden collar midst the motley hues
 Of our gay nobles I know not what besides
 But this first won me Be not angered sir
 But as I looked I never ranked you higher
 Than simple gentleman I asked your name
 Then when you Highness stooped to pick my flower
 My lord that moment was my thought a traitor
 For it had fain discrowned you


 DON JOHN
 May Gods angels
 Reward such treason Say me those words again
 Let the rich blush born of that dear confession
 Again dye cheek and brow and fade and melt
 Forever even as then


 MARIA
 We are watched my lord
 This is no place no hour for words like these


 DON JOHN
 When where then may we meet
 They pass on



 SCENE II

 The Palace Gardens Interrupted sounds of music and revelry
 come though the open windows of the ballroom seen in the
 background RIBERA pacing the stage occasionally pausing
 to look in upon the dancers


 RIBERA
 This is revenge Is she not beautiful
 Ye gods The beggars child matched with a prince
 Throb not so high my heart neath envious eyes
 Fixed on thy triumph Now am I well repaid
 For my slow martyred years Was I not wrung
 by keener tortures than my savage brush
 Though dipped in my hearts blood might reproduce
 No twisted muscle no contorted limb
 No agony of flesh have I yet drawn
 That owed not its suggestion to some pang
 Of my pride crucified my spirit racked
 My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate
 Engendered of oppression That is past
 But not forgotten though tonight I please
 To yield to gentler influence to own
 The strength of beauty and the power of joy
 And welcome gracious phantasies that throng
 And hover over me in airy shapes
 The spirits of earth and heaven contend tonight
 For mastery within me neer before
 Have I been more the Spagnoletto fired
 With noble wrath with the consuming fever
 And fierce delight of vengeance
 From this point
 I see her clearlythe auroral face
 Alight with smiles the imperial head upraised
 Her languid hand sways the broad silken fan
 Whose winglike movement stirs above her brow
 The fine bright curls as though warm airs of heaven
 Around her breathed He leads her midst the throng
 So they have gone but I will follow them
 And watch them from afar
 Exit

 Enter from the opposite side DON JOHN and MARIA


 DON JOHN
 I dread to ask
 What quivers on my lips My heart is free
 But thine


 MARIA
 My heart is free my lord


 DON JOHN
 Thank God


 MARIA
 It never beat less calmly at the sound
 Of any voice till now I laugh to think
 This very morn I fancied it had met
 Its master


 DON JOHN
 Ah


 MARIA
 Fear naughta simple boy
 A pupil of my fathers


 DON JOHN
 I was mad
 To dream it could be otherwise Forgive me
 I a mere stranger in they life am jealous
 Of all thy present and thy past


 MARIA
 Listen my lord
 You shall hear all What hour think you he chose
 To urge his cause The same wherein I learned
 Your Highness had commanded for tonight
 Our presence My winged thoughts were flying back
 To Count Lodovicos again I saw you
 My white rose at your lips your grave eyes fixed
 Most frankly yet most reverently on mine
 Again my heart sank as I heard the name
 The Prince of Austria and while I mused
 He spake of love Oh I am much to blame
 My mood was softalthough I promised naught
 I listened yea I listened Good my lord
 Do you not pity him


 DON JOHN
 Thanks and thanks again
 For thy confession Now no spot remains
 On the unblemished mirror of my faith
 Since that dear night I with one only thought
 Have gained the sum of knowledge and opinions
 Touching thine honored father with such scraps
 As the gross public voice could dole to me
 Concerning thine own farremoved white life
 Thou art I learn immured in close seclusion
 Thy father be it with all reverence said
 Hedges with jealous barriers his treasure
 Whilst thou most duteous tenderest of daughters
 Breathst but for him


 MARIA
 Dear father Were it so
 T were simple justice Ah if you knew him
 A proud large tameless heart This is the cloister
 Where he immures meNaples gayest revels
 The only bar wherewith he hedges me
 Is his unbounded trust that leaves me free
 Let us go in the late night air is chill


 DON JOHN
 Yet one more dance


 MARIA
 You may command my lord
 Exeunt

 Enter RIBERA


 RIBERA
 I lost them in the press Ah there they dance
 Again together I would lay my hands
 In blessing on that darling haughty head
 Like the Riberas child she bears her honors
 As lightly as a flower Yet there glows
 Unwonted lustre in her starry eyes
 And richer beauty blushes on her cheek
 Enough Now must I strive to fix that form
 That haunts my brainthe blind old Count Camillo
 The Princes oracle Midst the thick throng
 My fancy singled him white beard white hair
 Sealed eyes and brow lit by an inward light
 So will I paint mine Isaac blessing Esau
 While Jacob kneels before himblind betrayed
 By his own flesh

 As RIBERA stands aside lost in thought enter DON JOHN and MARIA


 MARIA
 See the impatient day
 Wakes in the east


 DON JOHN
 One moment here signora
 Breathe we the charm of this enchanted night
 Look where behind yon vines the slow moon sets
 Hidden from us while every leaf hangs black
 Each tender stalk distinct each curling edge
 Against the silver sky


 MARIA perceiving RIBERA
 What father here


 RIBERA
 MariaAh my Prince I crave your pardon
 When thus I muse t is but my mind that lives
 Each outward sense is dead I saw you not
 I heard nor voice nor footstep Yonder lines
 That streak the brightening sky east warn us away
 For all your grace to us the Spagnoletto
 Proffers his thanks to John of Austria
 My daughter art thou ready


 DON JOHN
 I am bound
 Illustrious signor rather unto you
 And the signora past all hope of payment
 When may I come to tender my poor homage
 To the Sicilian master


 RIBERA
 My lord will jest
 Our house is too much honored when he deigns
 Oerstep the threshold Let your royal pleasure
 Alone decide the hour


 DON JOHN
 Tomorrow then
 Or I should say today for dawn is nigh


 RIBERA
 And still we trespass Be it as you will
 We are your servants


 MARIA
 So my lord goodnight
 Exeunt MARIA and RIBERA


 DON JOHN alone
 Gods what a haughty devil rules that man
 As though two equal princes interchanged
 Imperial courtesies The Spagnoletto
 Thanks John of Austria Louis of France
 Might so salute may father By heaven I know not
 What patience or what reverence withheld
 My enchafed spirit in bounds of courtesy
 Nay it was she mine angel whose mere aspect
 Is balm and blessing How her lovelit eyes
 Burned through my soul How her soft hands slight pressure
 Tingled along my veins Oh she is worthy
 A heart religion How shall I wear the hours
 Ere I may seek her Lo I stand and dream
 While my late guests await me Patience patience
 Exeunt



 SCENE III

 Morning twilight in RIBERAS Garden During this scene the day
 gradually breaks and at the close the full light of morning
 illuminates the stage LORENZO
 AUBADE


 LORENZO sings
 From thy poppied sleep awake
 From they golden dreams arise
 Earth and seas new colors take
 Lovelight dawns in rosy skies
 Weird nights fantastic shadows are outworn
 Why tarriest thou oh sister to the morn


 Hearken love the matin choir
 Of birds salutes thee and with these
 Blends the voice of my desire
 Unto no richer promises
 Of deeper dearer holier love than mine
 Canst thou awaken from they dreams divine


 Lo thine eastern windows flame
 Brightening with the brightened sky
 Rise and with thy beauty shame
 Mornings regal pageantry
 To thrill and bless as the reviving sun
 For my heart gropes in doubt though night be gone


 He speaks
 Why should I fear Her soul is pledged to mine
 Albeit she still withheld the binding word
 How long hath been the night but morn breathes hope
 I fain were true to you and to myself
 Did she say thus or is my fevered brain
 The fool of its desires The world swam
 The blood rang beating in mine ears and roared
 Like rushing waters yet as through a dream
 I saw her dimly Surely on her lids
 Shone the clear tears As theres a God in heaven
 She spake those words My lips retain the touch
 Of those soft snowcold hands neither refused
 Nor proffered Such things ARE nor can they be
 Forgotten or foreknown Yes she is mine
 But soft Her casement opes Oh joy t is she
 Pale in a cloud of white she stands and drinks
 The morning sunlight


 MARIA above at the window
 Ah how sweet this air
 Kisses my sleepless lids and burning temples
 I am not weary though I found no rest
 My spirit leaps within me a new glory
 Blesses the dear familiar sceneripe orchard
 The sameyet oh how different Even I thought
 Soft music trembled on the listening air
 As though a harp were touched blent with low song
 Sure that was phantasy I will descend
 Visit my flowers and see whereon the dew
 Hangs heaviest and what fairest bud hath bloomed
 Since yestereve Why should I court repose
 And dull forgetfulness while the large earth
 Wakes no lesser joy than mine
 Exit from above


 LORENZO
 Oh heart
 How may my breast contain thee with thy burden
 Of too much happiness

 Enter MARIA below LORENZO springs forward to greet her she
 shrinks back in a sort of terror


 LORENZO
 Goodday sweet mistress
 May the blithe spirit of this auspicious morn
 Become the genius of thy days to come
 Whereof be none less beautiful than this
 Why art thou silent Does not love inspire
 Joyous expression be it but a sigh
 A song a smile a broken word a cry
 Thou hast not granted me the promised pledge
 For which I hunger still I would confirm
 With dear avowals frequent seals of love
 That which though sure I yet can scarce believe


 MARIA
 Somewhat too sure I think my lord Lorenzo
 I scarce deemed possible that one so shy
 But yestermorn should hold so high a mien
 Claiming what neer was given


 LORENZO
 Maria


 MARIA
 Sir
 You are a trifle bold to speak my name
 Familiarly as no man save my father
 Or my own brother dares


 LORENZO
 Ah now I see
 Your jest You will not seem so lightly won
 Without a wooing You will feign disdain
 Only to make more sweet your rich concession
 Too lateI heard it all A new light shines
 On the familiar scene What may that be
 Save the strange splendor of the dawn of love
 Nay darling cease to jest lest my poor heart
 Hanging twixt hell and heaven in earnest break


 MARIA
 Here is no jest sir but a fatal error
 Crying for swift correction You surprise me
 With rude impatience ere I have found time
 To con a gentle answer Pardon me
 If any phrase or word or glance of mine
 Hath bred or nourished in your heart a hope
 That you might win my love It cannot be


 LORENZO
 A word a glance Why the whole frozen statue
 Warmed into life Surely it was not you
 You must have bribed some angel with false prayers
 To wear your semblancenay no angel served
 But devilish witchcraft


 MARIA
 Sir enough enough
 I hoped to find here peace and solitude
 These lacking I retire Farewell
 Going toward the house


 LORENZO
 Signora
 I will not rob you of your own Farewell to you
 Exit


 MARIA
 Where have you flown bright dreams Has that rude hand
 Sufficed to dash to naught your frail creations
 Sad thoughts and humors black now fill my soul
 So his rough foot hath bruised the dewy grass
 And left it sere Why should his harsh words touch me
 The truth of yesterday is false today
 How could I know dear God How might I guess
 The bitter sweetness the delicious pain
 A new heart fills my breast as soft and weak
 And melting as a tear unto its lord
 But kindled with quick courage to endure
 If I need front for him a world of foes
 If this be love ah what a hell is theirs
 Who suffer without hope Even I who hold
 So many dear assurances who hear
 Still ringing in mine ears such sacred vows
 Am haunted with an unaccustomed doubt
 Not wonted to go handinhand with joy
 A gloomy omen greets me with the morn
 I who recoil from pain must strike and wound
 What may this mean Help me ye saints of heaven
 And holy mother for my strength is naught

 She falls on her knees and bursts into tears Reenter LORENZO


 LORENZO aside
 Thank heaven I came How have I wrung her soul
 A noble love forsooth A blind brute passion
 That being denied is swift transformed to hate
 No whit more cruel To Maria Lady


 MARIA rising hastily
 Signor Lorenzo
 Again what would you with me


 LORENZO
 No such suit
 As late I proffered but your gracious pardon


 MARIA
 Rise sir forgiven I too have been to blame
 Although less deeply than you deemed Forbear
 To bind your life I feel myself unworthy
 Of that high station where your thoughts enthrone me
 Yet I dare call myself your friend
 Offering him her hand which LORENZO presses to his lips


 LORENZO
 Thanks thanks
 Be blessed and farewell
 Exit

 Enter RIBERA calling


 RIBERA
 Daughter Maria


 MARIA
 Why father I am here kissing him Goodday What will you


 RIBERA
 Darling no more than what I always will
 Before I enter mine own world removed
 I fain would greet the dearest work of God
 I missed you when I rose I sought you first
 In your own chamber where the lattice oped
 Let in the morning splendor and smells
 Of the moist garden with the sound of voices
 I looked I found you herebut not alone
 What man was that went from you


 MARIA
 Your disciple
 My lord Lorenzo You remember father
 How yestermorn I pleaded for his work
 Thus he through gratitude andlove hath watched
 All night within our garden while I danced
 And when I came to nurse my flowershe spake


 RIBERA
 And you


 MARIA
 Am I not still beside you father
 I will not leave you


 RIBERA
 Ah mine angelchild
 I cannot choose but dread it though I wait
 Expectant of the hour when you fulfil
 Your womans destiny You have full freedom
 Yet I rejoice at this reprieve and thank thee
 For thy brave truthfulness Be ever thus
 Withholding naught from him whose heart reflects
 Only thine image Thou art still my pride
 Even as last night when all eyes gazed thy way
 Thy bearing equal in disdainful grace
 To his who courted theethy sovereigns son


 MARIA
 Yea so And yet it was not pride I felt
 Nor consciousness of self nor vain delight
 In the worlds envysomething more than these
 Far deeper sweeterWhat have I said My brain
 Is dull with sleep T is only now I feel
 The weariness of so much pleasure


 RIBERA rising
 Well
 Go we within Yes I am late to work
 We squander precious moments Thou go rest
 And waken with fresh roses in they cheeks
 To greet our royal guest
 Exeunt




ACT III

 SCENE I

 The studio of the Spagnoletto RIBERA before his canvas LUCA
 in attendance


 RIBERA laying aside his brush
 So I am weary Luca what s oclock


 LUCA
 My lord an hour past noon


 RIBERA
 So late already
 Well one more morning of such delicate toil
 Will make it ready for Madrid and worthy
 Not merely Philips eyes but theirs whose glance
 Outvalues a kings gaze my noble friend
 Velasquez and the monkish Zurbaran
 Luca


 LUCA
 My lord


 RIBERA
 Hath the signora risen


 LUCA
 Fiametta passed a brief while since and left
 My lady sleeping


 RIBERA
 Good she hath found rest
 Poor child she sadly lacked it She had known
 Twixt dawn and dawn no respite from emotion
 Her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine
 Her soft brow burned my lips Could that boy read
 The tokens of an overwearied spirit
 Strained past endurance he had spared her still
 At any cost of silence What is such love
 To mine that would outrival Roman heroes
 Watch mine arm crisp and shrivel in quick flame
 Or set a lynx to gnaw my heart away
 To save her from a needleprick of pain
 Ay or to please her At their worth she rates
 Her wooerslight as allembracing air
 Or universal sunshine Luca go
 And tell Fiamettarather bid the lass
 Hither herself
 Exit Luca
 He comes to pay me homage
 As would his royal father if he pleased
 To visit Naples yet she too shall see him
 She is part of all I think of all I am
 She is myself no less than yon bright dream
 Fixed in immortal beauty on the canvas

 Enter FIAMETTA


 FIAMETTA
 My lord you called me


 RIBERA
 When thy mistress wakes
 Array her richly that she be prepared
 To come before the Prince


 FIAMETTA
 Sir she hath risen
 And only waits me with your lordships leave
 To cross the street unto St Francis church


 RIBERA musingly
 With such slight escort Nay this troubles me
 Only the Stradas width The saints forbid
 That I should thwart her holy exercise
 Myself will go I cannot Bid her muffle
 Like our Valencian ladies her silk mantle
 About her face and head
 At a sign from RIBERA exit FIAMETTA
 Yes God will bless her
 What should I fear I will make sure her beauty
 Is duly masked
 He goes toward the casement
 Ay there she goesthe mantle
 Draped round the stately head discloses naught
 Save the live jewel of the eye Unless one guessed
 From the majestic grace and proud proportions
 She might so pass through the high thoroughfares
 Ah one thick curl escapes from its black prison
 Alone in Naples wreathed with rays of gold
 Her crown of light betrays her So shes safe

 Enter LUCA


 LUCA
 A noble gentleman of Spain awaits
 The masters leave to enter


 RIBERA
 Show him in
 Exit LUCA RIBERA draws the curtain before his picture of
 Jacobs Dream


 RIBERA
 A gentleman of Spain Perchance the Prince
 Sends couriers to herald his approach
 Or craves a longer grace

 Enter LUCA ushering in DON JOHN unattended completely enveloped
 in a Spanish mantle which he throws off his face almost hidden
 by a cavaliers hat He uncovers his head on entering RIBERA
 repressing a movement of surprise hastens to greet him and kisses
 his hand


 RIBERA
 Welcome my lord
 I am shamed to think my sovereigns son should wait
 Through a churls ignorance without my doors


 DON JOHN
 Dear master blame him not I came attended
 By one page only Here I blush to claim
 Such honor as depends on outward pomp
 No royalty is here save the crowned monarch
 Of our Sicilian artists Be it mine
 To press with reverent lips my masters hand


 RIBERA
 Your Highness is too gracious if you glance
 Round mine illfurnished studio my works
 Shall best proclaim me and my poor deserts
 Luca uplift you hangings


 DON JOHN seating himself
 Sir you may sit


 RIBERA aside seating himself slowly
 Curse his swollen arrogance Doth he imagine
 I waited leave of him
 Luca uncovers the picture


 DON JOHN
 Oh wonderful
 You have bettered here your best Why sir he breathes
 Will not those locked lids opethat nerveless hand
 Regain the iron strength of sinew mated
 With such heroic frame You have conspired
 With Nature to produce a man Behold
 I chatter foolish speech for such a marvel
 The fittest praise is silence
 He rises and stands before the picture


 RIBERA after a pause
 I am glad
 Your highness deigns approve Lose no more time
 Lest the poor details should repay you not
 Unto your royal home t will follow you
 Companion though unworthy to the treasures
 Of the Queens gallery


 DON JOHN
 T is another jewel
 Set in my fathers crown and in his name
 I thank you for it
 RIBERA bows silently DON JOHN glances around the studio


 DON JOHN
 There hangs a quaint strong head
 Though merely sketched What a marked cunning leer
 Grins on the wide mouth what a bestial glance


 RIBERA
 T is but a slight hint for my larger work
 Bacchus made drunk by Satyrs


 DON JOHN
 Where is that
 I neer have seen the painting


 RIBERA
 T is not in oils
 But etched in aquafortis Luca fetch down
 Yonder portfolio I can show your Highness
 The graven copy
 LUCA brings forward a large portfolio RIBERA looks hastily
 over the engravings and draws one out which he shows to DON JOHN


 DON JOHN
 Ah most admirable
 I know not who is best portrayedthe god
 Plump reeling wreathed with vine in whom abides
 Something Olympian still or the coarse Satyrs
 Thoroughly brutish Here I scarcely miss
 So masterly the grouping so distinct
 The bacchanalian spirit your rich brush
 So vigorous in color Do you find
 The pleasure in this treatment equals that
 Of the oil painting


 RIBERA
 All is in my mood
 We have so many petty talents clever
 To mimic Natures surface I name not
 The servile copyists of the greater masters
 Or of th archangels Raphael and Michael
 But such as paint our cheap and daily marvels
 Sometimes I fear lest they degrade our art
 To a nice craft for plodding artisans
 Mere realism which they mistake for truth
 My soul rejects such limits The true artist
 Gives Natures best effects with far less means
 Plain black and white suffice him to express
 A finer grace a stronger energy
 Than she attains with all the aid of color
 I argue thus and work with simple tools
 Like the Greek fathers of our artthe sculptors
 Who wrought in white alone their matchless types
 Then dazzled by the living bloom of earth
 Glowing with color I return to that
 My earliest worship and compose such work
 As you see there
 Pointing to the picture


 DON JOHN
 Would it be overmuch
 In my brief stay in Naples to beg of you
 A portrait of myself in aquafortis
 T would rob you sir of fewer golden hours
 Than the fullcolored canvas and enrich
 With a new treasure our royal gallery


 RIBERA
 You may command my hours and all thats mine


 DON JOHN rising
 Thanks generous master When may I return
 For the first sitting


 RIBERA
 I am ready now
 Today tomorrowwhen your Highness please


 DON JOHN
 T would be abuse of goodness to accept
 The present moment I will come tomorrow
 At the same hour in some more fitting garb
 Your hand sir and farewell Salute for me
 I pray you the signora May I not hope
 To see and thank her for her grace to me
 In so adorning my poor feast


 RIBERA
 The debt is ours
 She may be here tomorrowshe is free
 She only while I work to come and go
 Pray sir allow hershe is never crossed
 I stoop to beg for hershe is the last
 Who bides with meI crave you pardon sir
 What should this be to you


 DON JOHN
 T is much to me
 Whose privilege has been in this rare hour
 Beneath the master to discern the man
 And thus add friendship unto admiration
 He presses RIBERAS hand and is about to pick up his mantle and
 hat LUCA springs forward and while he is throwing the cloak
 around the Princess shoulders enter hastily MARIA enveloped in
 her mantilla as she went to church


 MARIA
 Well father an I veiled and swathed to suit you
 To cross the Strada
 She throws off her mantilla and appears all in white She goes
 to embrace her father when she suddenly perceives the Prince and
 stands speechless and blushing


 RIBERA
 Child his Royal Highness
 Prince John of Austria


 DON JOHN
 Goodday signora
 Already twice my gracious stars have smiled
 I saw you in the street You wore your mantle
 As the noon sun might wear a veil of cloud
 Covering but not concealing


 MARIA
 I sir twice
 Have unaware stood in your royal presence
 You are welcome to my fathers home and mine
 I scarce need crave your pardon for my entrance
 Yourself must see how well assured I felt
 My father was alone


 DON JOHN
 And so you hoped
 To find himshall I read your answer thus


 RIBERA
 Nay press her not Your Highness does her wrong
 So harshly to construe her simpleness
 My daughter and myself are one and both
 Will own an equal pleasure if you bide


 DON JOHN seating himself
 You chain me with kind words


 MARIA
 My father sir
 Hath surely told you our delight and marvel
 At the enchantments of your feast For me
 The night was brief rich beautiful and strange
 As a bright dream


 DON JOHN
 I will gainsay you not
 A beauteous soul can shed her proper glory
 On mean surroundings I have likewise dreamed
 Nor am I yet awake This morn hath been
 A feast for mind and eye Yon shepherdprince
 Whom angels visit in his sleep shall crown
 Your fathers brow with a still fresher laurel
 And link in equal fame the Spanish artist
 With the Lords chosen prophet


 RIBERA
 That may be
 For in the form of that wayfarer
 I drew myself So have I slept beneath
 The naked heavens pillowed by a stone
 With no more shelter than the windstirred branches
 While the thick dews of our Valencian nights
 Drenched my rude weeds and chilled through blood and bone
 Yet to me also were the heavens revealed
 And angels visited my dreams


 DON JOHN
 How strange
 That you dear masters standing on the crown
 Of a long lifes continuous ascent
 Should backward glance unto such dark beginnings


 RIBERA
 Obscure are all beginnings Yet I muse
 With pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle
 They were to me my birthright all the vigor
 The burning passion the unflinching truth
 My later pencil gained I gleaned from them
 I prized them I reclaimed their ragged freedom
 Rather than hold my seat a liveried slave
 At the rich board of my Lord Cardinal
 A palace was a prison till I reared
 Mine own But now my childs heart I would pierce
 Sooner than see it bear the least of ills
 Such as I then endured


 DON JOHN
 Donna Maria
 May smile sir at your threat she is in a pleasance
 Where no rude breezes blow no shadow falls
 Darker than that of cool and fragrant leaves
 Yea were it otherwisehad you not reaped
 The fruit of your own works she had not suffered
 Your children are Spains children


 RIBERA
 Sir that word
 Is the most grateful you have spoken yet
 Why are thou silent daughter


 MARIA absently
 What should I say
 The Prince is kind I scarcely heard your words
 I listened to your voices and I mused

 DON JOHN rising
 I overstep your patience


 MARIA
 You will be gone
 What have I said


 RIBERA
 You are a child Maria
 Tomorrow I will wait your Highness


 DON JOHN
 Thanks
 Tomorrow noon Farewell signora
 Exit DON JOHN


 RIBERA
 What ails you daughter You forget yourself
 Your tongue cleaves to your mouth You sit and muse
 A statue of white silence Twice today
 You have deeply vexed me Go not thus again
 Across the street with that light child Fiametta
 Faith you were closely muffled What was this
 This telltale auburn curl that rippled down
 Over the black mantilla Were I harsh
 Suspicious jealous fearful prone to wrath
 Or anything of all that I am not
 I should have deemed it no mere negligence
 But a bold token


 MARIA
 Father you make me quail
 Why do you threat me with such evil eyes
 Would they could read my heart


 RIBERA
 Elude me not
 Whom have you met beside the Prince this morn
 Who saw you pass Whom have you spoken with


 MARIA
 For Gods sake father what strange thoughts are these
 With none with none Beside the Prince you say
 Why even him I saw not as you know
 I hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground
 Swathed in my mantle still I told my beads
 And in like manner hasted home to you


 RIBERA
 Well it may pass but henceforth say thy matins
 In thine own room I know what vague cloud
 Obscures my sight and weighs upon my brain
 I am very weary Luca follow me
 Exeunt RIBERA and LUCA


 MARIA
 Poor father Dimly he perceives some trouble
 Within the threatening air Thank heaven I calmed him
 Yet I spake truth What could have roused so soon
 His quick suspicion Did Fiametta see
 The wary page slip in my hand the missive
 As we came forth again Nay even so
 My father hath not spoken with her since
 Sure he knows naught t is but my foolish fear
 Makes monsters out of shadows I may read
 The priceless lines and grave them on my heart
 She draws from her bosom a letter reads it and presses it to
 her lips
 He loves me yes he loves me Oh my God
 This awful joy in mine own breast is love
 Tonight he will await me in our garden
 Oh for a word a pressure of the hand
 I fly my prince at thy most dear behest
 Exit



 SCENE II

 A room in DON TOMMASOS HOUSE DON TOMMASO and ANNICCA


 DON TOMMASO
 Truly you wrong your sister she is young
 Heedless and wilful that is all a touch
 Of the Riberas spirit fired the lass
 Don John was but her weapon of revenge
 Against the malice of our haughty matrons
 Who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heights
 Of dignity upon the artists daughter


 ANNICCA
 I cannot think with you In her demeanor
 Her kindled cheek her melting eye was more
 Than sly revenge or cautious policy
 If that was art it overreached itself
 Ere the night ended I had blushed to see
 Slighting regards cast on my fathers child
 And hear her name and his tossed lightly round


 DON TOMMASO
 Could you not read in such disparagement
 The envy of small natures


 ANNICCA
 I had as lief
 Maria were to dance the tarantella
 Upon the quay at noonday as to see her
 Gazed at again with such insulting homage


 DON TOMMASO
 You are too strict your baseless apprehensions
 Wrong her far more than strangers jests


 ANNICCA
 Not so
 My timely fears prevent a greater ill
 And work no harm since they shall be imparted
 Only to him who hath the power to quell them
 Dissolving them to airmy father


 DON TOMMASO
 How
 You surely will not rouse his fatal wrath
 Annicca listen if your doubts were true
 He whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes
 More like the passion of some wild dumb creature
 With prowling jealousy and deadly spring
 Forth leaping at the first approach of ill
 Than the calm tenderness of human fathers
 He surely had been keen to scent the danger
 I saw him at the ballas is his wont
 He mingled not among the revellers
 But like her shadow played the spy on her


 ANNICCA
 A word would stir less deeply than you dread


 DON TOMMASO
 Ah there you err he knows no middle term
 At once he would accept as fact the worst
 Of your imaginings his rage would smite
 All near him and rebound upon himself
 For as I learn Don John brings royal orders
 For the Queens gallery he would dismiss
 The Prince as roughly as a begging artist
 Make no such breach just now betwixt the court
 And our own kindred


 ANNICCA
 Be it so Tommaso
 I will do naught in haste


 DON TOMMASO
 Watch thou and wait
 A slight reproof might now suffice the child
 Tame as a bird unto a gentle voice


 ANNICCA
 My mind misgives me yet will I find patience



 SCENE III

 Night in RIBERAS Garden DON JOHN alone


 DON JOHN
 In any less than she so swift a passion
 So unreserved so reckless had repelled
 In her t is godlike Our mutual love
 Was born fullgrown as we gazed each on each
 Nay t was not born but like a thing eternal
 It WAS ere we had consciousness thereof
 No growth of slow development but perfect
 From the beginning neither doomed to end
 Her garden breathes her own warm southern beauty
 Glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom
 Here I am happyhappy to dream and wait
 In rich security of bliss I know
 How brief an interval divides us now
 She hastes to meet me with no less impatience
 Than mine to clasp her in my arms to press
 Heart unto heart and see the love within
 The unfathomable depths of her great eyes
 She comes Maria

 Enter MARIA half timid half joyous


 MARIA
 My lord you have been waiting


 DON JOHN
 Darling not long t was but my restless love
 That drove me here before the promised hour
 So were I well content to wait through ages
 Upon the threshold of a joy like this
 Knowing the gates of heaven might ope to me
 At any moment


 MARIA
 Your love is less than mine
 For I have counted every tedious minute
 Since our last meeting


 DON JOHN
 I had rather speak
 Less than the truth to have you chide me thus
 Yet if you enter in the lists with me
 Faith match with faith and loyal heart with heart
 I warrant you the jealous god of love
 Who spies us from yon pomegranate bush
 Would crown me victor


 MARIA
 Why should we compete
 Who could decide betwixt two equal truths
 Two perfect faiths


 DON JOHN
 The worship of my life
 Will be slight payment for your boundless trust
 Look we nor forth nor back are we not happy
 Heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars
 The envious day forced us apart the wing
 Of obscure night protects and shelters us
 Now like a pure nightblooming flower puts forth
 The perfect blossom of our love Oh lean
 Thy royal head upon my breast assure me
 That this unheardof bliss is no fond dream
 Cling to me darling till thy loves dear burden
 Take root about my heartstrings


 MARIA after a pause
 Did you not hear
 A sound a cry Oh God was it my father


 DON JOHN
 Naught save the beating of our hearts I heard
 Be calm my love the very air is hushed
 Listen the tinkle of the fountain yonder

 The sleepy stir of leaves the querulous pipe
 Of some far birdno more


 MARIA
 I heard I heard
 A rude voice called me Wherefore did it come
 To snatch me from that dream of restful love
 Oh Juan you will save me you will help
 Tell me you willI have lost all for you


 DON JOHN
 Tomorrow you will laugh at fears like these
 You have lost naughtyou have but won my love
 Lose not your faith in thatyour shield and weapon


 MARIA
 I tremble still in every limb Goodnight
 I must be gone Tomorrow when you come
 Be wary with my father he is fierce
 In love and hatred Listen and look my lord
 If one dared say to me but yestermorn
 That I would meet at night a stranger youth
 In mine own garden talk with him of love
 And hint a thought against the Spagnoletto
 I had smitten with this bauble such a one
 Pointing to a jewelled poniard in her belt
 Kiss me my Juan once again Goodnight
 Exit MARIA



 SCENE IV

 The studio RIBERA and ANNICCA


 ANNICCA
 Has he come often


 RIBERA
 Nay I caught the trick
 Of his fair face in some halfdozen sittings
 His is a bold and shapely headit pleased me
 I like the lad the work upon his portrait
 Was pastimet is already nigh complete


 ANNICCA
 And has Maria sat here while you worked


 RIBERA sharply
 Why not What wouldst thou say Speak fret me not
 With ticklish fears Is she not by my side
 For work or rest


 ANNICCA
 Surely I meant no harm
 Father how quick you are I had but asked
 If she being here had seen the work progress
 And found it his true counterpart


 RIBERA
 Annicca
 There is something in your thought you hold from me
 Have the lewd prying eyes the slanderous mind
 Of public envy spied herein some mischief
 What hast thou heard By heaven if one foul word
 Have darkened the fair fame of my white dove
 Naples shall rue it Let them not forget
 The chapel of Saint Januarius


 ANNICCA aside
 Tommaso judged aright I dare not tell him
 Dear father listen Pray be calm Sit down
 Your own hot rage engenders in my mind
 Thoughts fears suspicions


 RIBERA seating himself
 I am foolish hasty but it makes me mad
 Listen to me Here sits the Prince before me
 We talk we laugh We have discussed all themes
 From the great Angelos divinity
 Down to the pest of flies that fret us here
 At the days hottest Sometimes he will pace
 The studiosuch young blood is seldom still
 He brought me once his mandoline and drew
 Eloquent music thence I study thus
 The changeful play of soul I catch the spirit
 Behind the veil and burn it on the plate
 Maria comes and goeswill sit awhile
 Over her broidery then will haste away
 And serve us with a dish of golden fruit
 That is for me she knows the sweet cool juice
 After long hours of work refreshes me
 More than strong wine She meets his Royal Highness
 As the Riberas child should meet a Prince
 Nor over bold nor timid one would think
 Their rank was equal and that neither sprang
 From less than royal lineage


 ANNICCA
 Why I know it
 Here is no need to excuse or justify
 Speak rather of your workis the plate finished


 RIBERA
 So nigh that were Don John to leave tomorrow
 It might go with him


 ANNICCA
 What he leaves Naples


 RIBERA
 Yea but I know not when he seems to wait
 Momently orders from his Majesty
 To travel onward


 ANNICCA aside
 Would he were well away


 RIBERA
 What do you mutter I grow deaf this side


 ANNICCA
 I spake not father I regret with you
 The Prince should leave us you have more enjoyed
 His young companionship than any strangers
 These many years


 RIBERA
 Well well enough of him
 He hath a winning airso far so good
 I know not that I place more trust in him
 Than in another T is a lying world
 I am too old now to be duped or dazzled
 By fair externals

 Enter MARIA carrying a kirtle full of flowers


 MARIA
 Father see my roses
 Have blossomed over night I bring you some
 To prank your study Sister Don Tommaso
 Seeks you below


 ANNICCA rising
 I will go to meet him Father
 Until tomorrow
 Embraces MARIA and exits MARIA sits by her fathers side and
 displays her flowers


 RIBERA
 Truly a gorgeous show
 Pink yellow crimson whitewhich is the fairest
 Those with the deepest blush should best become you
 Nay they accord not with your hairs red gold
 The white ones suit you bestpale innocent
 So flowers too can lie Is not that strange
 MARIA looks at him in mingled wonder and affright He roughly
 brushes aside all the flowers upon the floors than picks one up
 and carefully plucks it to pieces
 I think not highly of your flowers girl
 I have plucked this leaf it has no heart
 See there
 He laughs contemptuously


 MARIA
 What have I done Alas what mean you
 Have you then lost your reason


 RIBERA
 Nay but found it
 I who was dull of wit am keen at last
 Don John is comely and Don John is kind
 A wonderful musician is Don John
 A princely artistand then meek of mien
 You enter in his presence modest simple
 And who beneath that kitten grace had spied
 The claws of mischief Who Why all the world
 Save the fond wrinkled hoary fool thy father
 Out girl for shame He will be here anon
 Hence to your roomhe shall not find you here
 Thank God thank God no evil hath been wrought
 That may not be repaired I have sat by
 At all your meetings You shall have no more
 Myself will look to that Away away
 Exit Maria


 RIBERA looks after her
 As one who has received a deadly hurt
 She walks What if my doubts be false The terror
 Of an unlookedfor blow a treacherous thrust
 When least expectedthat is all she showed
 On a false charge myself had acted thus
 She had been moved far otherwise if guilty
 She had wept protested beggedshe had not left
 With such a proud and speechless show of grief
 I was too harsh too quick on slight suspicion
 What did Annicca say Why she said naught
 T was her grave air her sudden reticence
 Her illassumed indifference They play on me
 They know me not They dread my violent passions
 Not guessing what a firm and constant bridle
 I hold them with On just cause to be angered
 Is merely human Yet they sound my temper
 They try to lead me like some halftamed beast
 That must be coaxed Well I may laugh thereat
 But I am not myself today strange pains
 Shoot through my head and limbs and vex my spirit
 Oh I have wronged my child Return Maria
 Exit calling




ACT IV

 SCENE I

 Night RIBERAS bedroom RIBERA discovered in his dressinggown
 seated reading beside a table with a light upon it Enter from
 an open door at the back of the stage MARIA She stands
 irresolute for a moment on the threshold behind her father
 watching him passes her hand rapidly over her brow and eyes
 and then knocks


 MARIA
 May I come in dear father


 RIBERA putting down his book and looking at her affectionately
 Child you ask


 MARIA advancing
 You study late I came to bid goodnight


 RIBERA
 Poor child thou must be weary Thou art pale
 Still from thy swoon


 MARIA with a forced laugh
 I had forgotten it
 Nay I am well again


 RIBERA
 But I forget it not
 Neither forgive myself Well it is past
 Enough When the Prince left I sent for thee
 Thou wast still sleeping


 MARIA with confusion
 Yes I was outworn
 What didst thou wish of me


 RIBERA
 Merely to tell thee
 Don John leaves Naples He expressed regret
 Most courteously that thou wast suffering
 He had fain ordered us his parting thanks
 For our kind welcomeso he deigned to say
 Tomorrow he may steal a moments grace
 To see us both once more but this is doubtful
 So he entrusted his farewells to me


 MARIA
 May peace go with him


 RIBERA
 We are alone
 Are we not darling Thanks for the calm content
 Wherewith thou biddest him farewell to nestle
 Once more in mine embrace Not long I feel
 May these old horny eyes be blest with sight
 Of thy fullflowering grace these wrinkled lips
 Be pressed against thy brow I am no more
 What I have been at times both hand and brain
 Refuse their task Myself will follow soon
 The better part of me already dead
 So the worm claims us by slow torture child
 Thoult bear with me if as today I wrong
 Thy gentle spirit


 MARIA
 Father no more no more
 You break my heart


 RIBERA
 Mine angelchild weep not
 So bitterly I thought not thus to move thee
 Still thou art overwrought I would have asked
 At last a promise of thee I am selfish
 But I would sleep less startingly onights
 And bear a calmer soul by day were I secure
 That thou wilt bide with me until the end
 A pause
 Tonight I will not press thee Thou art weary
 Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet
 But from thy deep emotion I can see
 T will cost thee less than I have feared Tomorrow
 We will talk of this again


 MARIA
 Tomorrow


 RIBERA
 Now
 Goodnight T is time thou shouldst be sleeping


 MARIA
 Father
 I cannot leave thee Every word of thine
 Gnaws like a burning coal my sore soft heart
 What thou shalt suffer and thine own Maria
 Will leave thee daughterless uncomforted
 What thou shalt weep and other eyes than mine
 Shall see the Spagnolettos spirit broken


 RIBERA
 There there poor child Look up cling not so wildly
 About my neck Thou art too finely touched
 If thus the faint foreshadow of a grief
 Can overcome thee Listen What was that


 MARIA starts up shudders violently and all at once masters
 her emotion
 Why I heard nothing father


 RIBERA
 Yes a sound
 Of footsteps and a stifled call
 He goes toward the casement MARIA tries to detain him


 MARIA
 Dear father
 Surely t was naught Your ears deceive you
 The wind is rising and you heard the leaves
 Rustling together


 RIBERA
 Nay I will look forth
 He opens the casement and looks out in silence MARIA stands
 behind him with her hands clasped in an agony of fear


 RIBERA calling
 Hist answer Who goes there a pause No sound Thourt right
 Maria I see naught our garden lies
 Vacant and still save for the swaying branches
 Of bush and tree T is a wild threatening night
 A sultry breeze is blowing and the sky
 Hangs black above Vesuvius Yonder cloud
 Hath lightnings in it Ah a blinding bolt
 Dims the volcanos pillared fire Enough
 He closes the casement and returns to MARIA
 Hark how the thunder rolls My child you tremble
 Like the blown leaves without


 MARIA
 I am oppressed
 By the same stormy influence Thou knowest
 I dread the thunder


 RIBERA
 Thou who art safely housed
 Why shouldst thou dread it Try to sleep my darling
 Forget the terror of the tempest morn
 Will break again in sunshine


 MARIA
 Father say
 You love me and you trust me once again
 Before I bid goodnight


 RIBERA
 If it will calm thee
 I love thee and I trust thee Thou art to me
 My geniusthou the breathing image still
 Of thy saintmother whom the angels guard
 Even as thou standest now vested in white
 With glowing eyes and pale unsmiling face
 I see her as she stood the day her heart
 Went forth from home and kin to bless the stranger
 Who craved her fathers alms


 MARIA
 Thanks thanks Goodnight
 God bless us through these wild dark hours


 RIBERA
 Goodnight



 SCENE II

 RIBERAS garden Half the sky illuminated by an overclouded
 moon the rest obscured by an approaching storm Occasional
 thunder and lightning On on side of the stage a summerhouse
 open to the audience on the other side the exterior of the
 dwelling DON JOHN discovered waiting near the house The door
 opens and enter MARIA


 DON JOHN springing forward and embracing her
 At last at last


 MARIA
 Juan beware My fathers fears
 I cannot guess by whom or what are roused
 She extends her arms gropingly to embrace him
 Oh let me feel thee near meI see naught
 Follow me here our voices may be heard
 She hastens towards the summerhouse leaning upon his arm
 and sinks upon a seat
 Have not slow ages passed with crowding woes
 Since we last met What have I not endured
 Oh Juan save me


 DON JOHN
 Dearest child be calm
 Thou art strangely overwrought Speak not Await
 Till this wild fear be past


 MARIA
 How great you are
 Your simple presence stills and comforts me
 While you are here the one thing real to me
 In all the universe is love


 DON JOHN
 And yet
 My love is here if I be far or nigh
 Is this the spirit of a soldiers wife
 Nay fiery courage iron fortitude
 That soul must own that dares to say I love


 MARIA
 And I dare say it I can bear the worst
 That envious fate may heap upon my head
 If thou art with me or for hope of thee


 DON JOHN
 Art sure of that Thou couldst not part from me
 Even for thy fathers sake


 MARIA
 Talk you of parting
 For Gods sake what is this You love no more


 DON JOHN
 Rather I love so truly that I shrink
 From asking thee to share a soldiers fate
 I tremble to uproot so fine a flower
 From its dear native earth I


 MARIA putting her hand on his lips
 Hush no more
 I need no preparation more than this
 Your mere request


 DON JOHN
 There spake my heroine
 The King my father bids me to repair
 Unto Palermo


 MARIA
 Shall we sail tonight


 DON JOHN
 My Princess Thou recoilest not from all
 Thou must endure ere I can openly
 Claim thee my wife


 MARIA
 The pangs of purgatory
 Were lightly borne with such a heaven in view
 I were content with one brief hour a day
 Snatched from the toils of war and thy high duties
 To gaze on thy dear faceto feel thy hand
 Even as now a stay and a caress


 DON JOHN
 Angel I have no thanks May God forget me
 When I forget this hour So thou art firm
 Ready this night to leave thy home thy kin
 Thy father


 MARIA solemnly
 I am ready and resolved
 Yet judge me not so lightly as to deem
 I say this with no pang My love were naught
 Could I withdraw it painlessly at once
 From him round whose colossal strength the tendrils
 Of mine own baby heart were taught to twine
 I speak not now as one who swerves or shrinks
 But merely dear to show thee what sharp tortures
 I nowise blind but with deliberate soul
 Embrace for thee


 DON JOHN
 How can I doubt the anguish
 So rude a snapping of all ties must smite
 Thy tender heart withal Yet dwell we not
 On the brief pain but on the enduring joys
 If Riberas love be all thou deemest
 He will forgive thy secret flight thy


 MARIA
 Secret
 May I not bid farewell May I not tell him
 Where we are bound How soon he may have hope
 To hear from meto welcome me thy Princess
 I dare not leave him without hope


 DON JOHN
 My child
 Thou art mad We must be secret as the grave
 Else are we both undone I have given out
 That I depart in princely state tomorrow
 Far from the quay a bark awaiteth us
 I know my man Shrouded by careful night
 We will set secret sail for Sicily
 Once in Palermo thou mayst write thy father
 Sue for his pardontell him that ere long
 When I have won by cautious policy
 King Philips favor thou shalt be proclaimed
 Princess of Austria


 MARIA who has hung upon his words with trembling excitement
 covers her face with her hands and bursts into tears
 I cannot no I cannot


 DON JOHN scornfully
 I feared as much Well it is better thus
 I asked thee not to front the worst of ills
 That envious fate could heap upon thy head
 Only a little patience T was too much
 I cannot blame thee T is a loving father
 I a mere stranger had naught else to hope
 Matching my claim with his


 MARIA looks at him and throws herself at his feet
 Oh pardon pardon
 My Lord my Prince my husband I am thine
 Lead wheresoeer thou wilt I follow thee
 Tell me a lifes devotion may efface
 The weakness of a moment


 DON JOHN raising her tenderly and embracing her
 Ah mine own



 SCENE III

 Morning The studio Enter RIBERA


 RIBERA
 How laughingly the clear sun shines today
 On stormdrenched green and cool farglittering seas
 When she comes in to greet me she will blush
 For last nights terrors How she crouched and shuddered
 At the mere thought of the wild war without
 Poor clinging womens souls what need is theirs
 Of our protecting love Yet even on me
 The shadow of the stormcloud seemed to breed
 Through my vexed sleep I heard the thunder roll
 My dreams were uglyWell all that is past
 Today my spirit is renewed T is long
 Since I have felt so fresh
 He seats himself before his easel and takes up his brush and
 palette but holds them idly in his hand
 Strange she still sleeps
 The hour is past when she is wont to come
 To bless me with the kiss of virgin love
 Mayhap t was fever in her eyes last night
 Gave them so wild a glance so bright a lustre
 God if she should be ill
 He rises and calls
 Luca

 Enter LUCA


 LUCA
 My lord


 RIBERA
 Go ask Fiametta if the mistress sleeps
 If she be ailingwhy she has not come
 This morn to greet me
 Exit LUCA


 RIBERA begins pacing the stage
 What fond fears are these
 Mastering my spirit Since her mother died
 I tremble at the name of pain or ill
 How can my rude love tend my hard hand soothe
 The dear childs fragile
 A confused cry without
 What is that My God
 How hast thou stricken me
 He staggers and falls into a chair Enter hastily FIAMETTA
 weeping and LUCA with gestures of terror and distress


 FIAMETTA
 Master


 LUCA
 Dear master
 RIBERA rises with a great effort and confronts them


 RIBERA
 What is it Speak


 LUCA
 Dear master she is gone


 RIBERA
 How Murdereddead Oh cruel God Away
 Follow me not
 Exit RIBERA


 FIAMETTA
 Help all ye saints of heaven
 Have pity on him Oh what a day is this


 LUCA
 Quiet Fiametta When the master finds
 The empty untouched bed the silent room
 His wits will leave him Hark was that his cry

 Reenter RIBERA calling


 Maria Daughter Where have they taken thee
 My only one my darling Oh the brigands
 Naples shall bleed for this What do ye here
 Slaves fools who stare upon me Know ye not
 I have been robbed Hence Ransack every house
 From cave to roof in Naples Search all streets
 Arrest whomso ye meet Let no sail stir
 From out the harbor Ring the alarum Quick
 This is a general woe
 Exeunt LUCA and FIAMETTA
 The Dukes my friend
 Hell further me The Princeoh hideous fear
 No no I will not dream it Mine enemies
 Have done this thing the avengers of that beggar
 Domenichinothey have struck home at last
 How was it that I heard no sound no cry
 Throughout the night The heavens themselves conspired
 Against methe hoarse thunder drowned her shrieks
 Oh agony
 He buries his face in his hands Enter ANNICCA she throws
 herself speechless and weeping upon his neck
 Thou knowest it Annicca
 The thief has entered in the nightshes gone
 I stand and weep I stir not hand or foot
 Is not the household roused Do they not seek her
 I am helpless weak an old man overnight
 The brigands work was easy I heard naught
 But surely surely had they murdered her
 I had heard thatthat would have wakened me
 From out my grave


 ANNICCA
 Father she is not dead


 RIBERA wildly
 Where have they found her What dost thou know Speak speak
 Ere my heart break


 ANNICCA
 Alas they have not found her
 But that were easy Nerve thyselfremember
 Thou art the Spagnoletto still Last night
 Don John fled secretly from Naples


 RIBERA
 Ah
 Give me a draft of water
 He sinks down on his chair


 ANNICCA calling
 Help Tommaso
 Luca Fiametta Father lookup look up
 Gaze not so hollowly

 Enter DON TOMMASO and SERVANTS

 Quick water water
 Do ye not see he swoons
 She kneels before her father chafing and kissing his hands Exit
 LUCA who returns immediately with a silver flagon of water ANNICCA
 seizes it and raises it to RIVERAS lips He takes it from her hand
 and drinks


 RIBERA
 How your hand trembles
 See mine is firm You had spilt it oer my beard
 Had I not saved it Thanks I am strong again
 I am very old for such a steady grasp
 Why girl most men as hoary as thy father
 Are long since palsied But my firm touch comes
 From handling of the brush I am a painter
 The Spagnoletto
 As he speaks his name he suddenly throws off his apathy rises
 to his full height and casts the flagon to the ground
 Ah the Spagnoletto
 Disgraced abandoned My exalted name
 The laughingstock of churls my hearthstone stamped
 With everlasting shame my pride my fame
 Mine honorwhere are they With yon spilt water
 Fouled in the dust sucked by the thirsty air
 Now by Christs blood my vengeance shall be huge
 As mine affront I will demand full justice
 From Philip We will treat as King with King
 HE shall be stripped of rank and name and wealth
 Degraded lopped from off the fellowship
 Of Christians like a rotten limb proclaimed
 The bastard that he is She shall go with him
 Linked in a common infamy haled round
 A female Judas who betrayed her father
 Her God her conscience with a kiss Her shadow
 Shall be my curse Cursed be her sleep by night
 Accursed her light by dayher meat and drink
 Accursed the fruit of her own wombthe grave
 Where she will lie CursedOh my child my child
 He throws himself on the floor and buries his head among the
 cushions of the couch DON TOMMASO advances and lays his hand
 on RIBERAS shoulder


 DON TOMMASO
 Mine honored sir


 RIBERA looks up without rising
 Surely you mock me signor
 Honored Yes honored with a rifled home
 A desecrated heart a strumpet child
 For honors such as these I have not stinted
 Sweat blood or spirit through long years of toil
 I have passed through peril scathless I was spared
 When Naples was plaguestricken I have scaped
 Mine enemies stilettofire and flood
 I have survived my love my youth my self
 My thriceblest Leonora whom I pitied
 Fool that I was in her void silent tomb
 The God of mercy hath reserved me truly
 For a wise purpose


 ANNICCA
 Father rise take courage
 We know not yet the end


 RIBERA
 Why should I rise
 To front the level eyes of mens contempt
 Oh I am shamed Cover my head Annicca
 Darken mine eyes and veil my face Oh God
 Would that I were a nameless obscure man
 So could I bury with me my disgrace
 That now must be immortal Where thou standest
 Annicca there she stood last night She kissed me
 Round mine old neck she wreathed her soft young arms
 My wrinkled cheeks were wet with her warm tears
 She shuddered and I thought it was the thunder
 Struck terror through her soul Whitebearded fool


 FIAMETTA
 I found this scrip upon the chamberfloor
 Mayhap it brings some comfort


 RIBERA starts up and snatches the paper she offers him reads
 it rapidly then to ANNICCA wildly
 Look look there
 T is writ in blood My duty to my lord
 Forbids my telling you our present port
 I would track her down with sleuthhounds did I not
 Abhor to see her face Ah press thy hands
 Against my headmy brain is like to burst
 My throat is choked Help help
 He swoons



 SCENE IV

 A street Enter LORENZO and a GENTLEMAN meeting They salute
 and LORENZO is about to pass on


 LORENZO
 Goodmorning sir


 GENTLEMAN
 Hail and farewell so soon
 Friend dreamer I will lay a goodly sum
 The news that flies like fire from tongue to tongue
 Hath not yet warmed thine ear


 LORENZO
 Whats that I lay
 A sum as fair thy news is some dry tale
 Of courtly gossip touching me as nigh
 As the dissensions of the antipodes


 GENTLEMAN
 Done for a hundred florins In the night
 Midst the wild storm whose roar must have invaded
 Even thy leaden sleep Prince John left Naples
 We should have had a pageant here today
 A royal exit floral arches thrown
 From house to house in all the streets he passed
 Music and guard of honor homage fitting
 The son of Philipbut the bird has flown


 LORENZO
 So I regret our busy citizens
 Who sun themselves daylong upon the quays
 Should be deprived of such a festival
 Your wagers losthow am I moved by this

 GENTLEMAN
 Hark to the end T would move all men whose veins
 Flow not clear water He hath carried off
 The Rose of Naples


 LORENZO
 What wouldst thou say Speak out
 In Gods name who hath followed him


 GENTLEMAN
 Ah thourt roused
 Thy master hath been robbedthe Spagnoletto
 Maria of the Golden Lockshis daughter


 LORENZO
 How is this known T is a foul slander forged
 By desperate malice What in the night you say
 She whose bright name was clean as gold whose heart
 Shone a fixed star of loyal love and duty
 Beside her fathers glory This coarse lie
 Denies itself I will go seek the master
 And if this very noon she walk not forth
 Led by the Spagnoletto through the streets
 To blind the dazed eyes of her slanderers
 I am your debtor for a hundred florins


 GENTLEMAN
 Your faith in womanhood becomes you sir
 Aside A beggars child the mistress of a Prince
 Humph there be some might think the weight of scandal
 Lay on the other side To Lorenzo You need not forth
 To seek her father See he comes alone
 I will not meddle in the broil Farewell
 Exit Gentleman

 Enter RIBERA without hat or mantle slowly with folded arms
 and bent head


 LORENZO
 Oh heart break not for pity Shall he thus
 Unto all Naples blazon his disgrace
 This must not be advancing Father


 RIBERA starts and looks up sharply
 Who calls me father


 LORENZO
 Why master Iyou know me not Lorenzo


 RIBERA
 Nor do I care to know thee Thou must be
 An arrant coward thus to league with foes
 Against so poor a wretch as Ito call me
 By the most curst despised unhallowed name
 Gods creatures can own Away and let me pass
 I injure no man


 LORENZO
 Look at me dear master
 Your head is bare your face is ashy pale
 The sun is fierce I am your friend your pupil
 Let me but guide my reverend master home
 In token of the grateful memory
 Wherein I hold his guidance of my mind
 Up the steep paths of art
 While LORENZO speaks RIBERA slowly gains consciousness of his
 situation raises his hand to his head and shudders violently
 LORENZOS last words seem to awaken him thoroughly


 RIBERA
 I crave your pardon
 If I have answered roughly Sir Lorenzo
 My thoughts were far awayI failed to know you
 I have had trouble sir You do remind me
 I had forgot my hat that is a trifle
 Yet now I feel the loss What slaves are we
 To circumstance One who is wont to cover
 For fashion or for warmth his pate goes forth
 Bareheaded and the sun will seem to smite
 The shrinking spot the breeze will make him shiver
 And yet our hatless beggars heed them not
 We are the fools of habit

 Enter two gentlemen together as promenading they cross the stage
 looking hard at RIBERA and LORENZO and exeunt


 LORENZO
 Pray you sir
 Let me conduct you home Here is no place
 To hold discourse In Gods name come with me


 RIBERA
 What coupled staring fools were they that passed
 They seemed to scare thee Why boy face them out
 I am the shadow of the Spagnoletto
 Else had I brooked no gaze so insolent
 Well I will go with thee But hark thee lad
 A word first in thine ear T is a grim secret
 Whisper it not in Naples I but tell thee
 Lest thou should fancy I had lost my wits
 My daughter hath deserted mehath fled
 From Naples with a bastard Thou hast seen her
 MariaRosathou must remember her
 She whom I painted as Madonna once
 She had fair hair and Spanish eyes When was it
 I came forth thinking I might meet with her
 And find all this a dreama foolish thought
 I am very weary Yawning I have walked and walked
 For hours How far sir stand we from the Strada
 Nardo I live there nigh Saint Francis church

 LORENZO
 Why t is hard by a stones throw from this square
 So lean on meyou are not well This way
 Pluck up good heart sir we shall soon be there
 Exeunt



 SCENE V

 Night A Room in RIBERAS House ANNICCA seated alone in an
 attitude of extreme weariness and despondency


 ANNICCA
 His heavy sleep still lasts Despite the words
 Of the physician I can cast not off
 That ghastly fear Albeit he owned no drugs
 This deathlike slumber this deep breathing slow
 His livid pallor makes me dread each moment
 His weary pulse will cease This is the end
 And from the first I knew it The worst evil
 My warning tongue had wrought were joy to this
 No heavier curse could I invoke on her
 Than that she see him in her dreams her thoughts
 As he is now I could no longer bear it
 I have fled hither from his couch to breathe
 To quicken my spent courage for the end
 I cannot praymy heart is full of curses
 He sleeps he rests What better could I wish
 For his rent heart his stunned unbalanced brain
 Than sleep to be eternally prolonged

 Enter FIAMETTA ANNICCA looks up anxiously half rising


 ANNICCA
 How now What news


 FIAMETTA
 The master is awake
 And calls for you signora


 ANNICCA
 Heaven be praised
 Exit hastily


 FIAMETTA
 Would I had followed my young mistress Here
 I creep about like a scared guilty thing
 And fancy at each moment they will guess
 T was I who led her to the hut I will confess
 If any sin there be to Father Clement
 And buy indulgence with her golden chain
 T would burn my throat the masters rolling eyes
 Would haunt me ever if I went to wear it
 So all will yet be well
 Exit



 SCENE VI

 RIBERAS Room RIBERA discovered sitting on the couch He looks
 old and haggard but has regained his natural bearing and
 expression Enter ANNICCA She hastens towards him and kneels
 beside the couch kissing him affectionately


 ANNICCA
 Father you called me


 RIBERA
 Aye to bid goodnight
 Why do you kiss me To betray tomorrow


 ANNICCA
 Dear father you are better you have slept
 Are you not rested


 RIBERA
 Child I was not weary
 There was some cloud pressed here pointing to his forehead but
 that is past
 I have no pain nor any sense of ill
 Now while my brain is clear I have a word
 To speak I think not I have been to thee
 Nor to that other one an unkind father
 I do not now remember any act
 Or any word of mine could cause thee grief
 But I am oldperchance my memory
 Deceives in this Speak Am I right Annicca


 ANNICCA weeping
 Oh father father why will you torture me
 You were too good too good


 RIBERA
 Why so I thought
 Since it appears the guerdon of such goodness
 Is treachery abandonment disgrace
 I here renounce my fatherhood No child
 Will I acknowledge mine Thou art a wife
 Thy duty is thy husbands When Antonio
 Returns from Seville tell him that his father
 Is long since dead Henceforward I will own
 No kin no home no tie I will away
 Tomorrow morn and live an anchorite
 One thing ye cannot rob me ofmy work
 My name shall still outsoar these low mirk vapors
 Not the Ribera stained with sin and shame
 As she hath left it but the Spagnoletto
 My glory is mine own I have done with it
 But I bequeath it to my country Now
 I will make friends with beaststheyll prove less savage
 Than she that was my daughter I have spoken
 For the last time that word Thee I curse not
 Thou hast not set thy heel upon my heart
 But yet I will not bless thee Go Goodnight


 ANNICCA embracing him
 What will you spurn me thus Nay I will bide
 And be to thee all that she should have been
 Soothe thy declining years and heal the wound
 Of this sharp sorrow Thou shalt bless me still
 Father
 RIBERA has yielded for a moment to her embrace but suddenly
 rising he pushes her roughly from him


 RIBERA
 Away I know thee Thou art one
 With her who duped me with like words last night
 Then I believed but now my sense is closed
 My heart is dead as stone I cast thee forth
 By heaven I own thee not Thou dost forget
 I am the Spagnoletto Away I say
 Or ere I strike thee
 He threatens her


 ANNICCA
 Woe is me Help help
 Exit


 RIBERA
 So the last link is snapt Had I not steeled
 My heart I fain had kissed her farewell
 T is better so I leave my work unfinished
 Could I arise each day to face this spectre
 Or sleep with it at nightto yearn for her
 Even while I curse her No The dead remain
 Sacred and sweet in our remembrance still
 They seem not to have left us they abide
 And linger nigh us in the viewless air
 The fallen the guilty must be rooted out
 From heart and thought and memory With them
 No hope of blest reunion they must be
 As though they had not been their spoken name
 Cuts like a knife When I essay to think
 Of what hath passed today my sick brain reels
 The letter I remember but all since
 Floats in a mist of horror and I grasp
 No actual form Did I not wander forth
 A mob surrounded me All Naples knew
 My downfall and the street was paved with eyes
 That stared into my soul Then friendly hands
 Guided me hither When I woke I felt
 As though a stone had rolled from off my brain
 But still this nightmare bides the truth I know
 They watch me they suspect me I will wait
 Till the whole household sleep and then steal forth
 Nor unavenged return




ACT V

 SCENE I

 A Room in DON TOMMASOS House ANNICCA discovered attired in
 mourning Enter DON TOMMASO


 DON TOMMASO
 If he still live now shall we hear of him
 The news I learn will lure him from his covert
 Whereer it lie to pardon or avenge


 ANNICCA eagerly
 What news What cheer Tommaso


 DON TOMMASO
 Meagre cheer
 But tidings that break through our slow suspense
 Like the first thunderclap in sultry air
 Don John sets sail from Sicily to wed
 A Princess chosen by the King Maria


 ANNICCA
 Talk not of herI know her not her name
 Will sear thy tongue Thinkst thou in truth this news
 Will draw my father from his hidingplace
 Noteach me not to hope Within my heart
 A sure voice tells me he is dead Not his
 The spirit to drag out a shameful life
 To shrink from honest eyes to sink his brow
 Unto the dust here where he wore his crown
 Thou knowest him Have I not cause to mourn
 Uncomforted that he the first of fathers
 Selfmurderednay childmurderedOh Tommaso
 I would fare barefoot to the ends of the earth
 To look again upon his living face
 See in his eyes the light of love restored
 Not blasting me with lightnings as before
 To kneel to him to solace him to win
 For mine own head yoked in my sisters curse
 The blessing he refused me


 DON TOMMASO
 Well take comfort
 This grace may yet be thine



 SCENE II

 Palermo A Nunnery Enter ABBESS followed by a LaySister


 ABBESS
 Is the poor creature roused


 LAYSISTER
 Nay she still sleeps
 T would break your pious heart to see her mother
 She begged our meanest cell though t is past doubt
 She has been bred to delicate luxury
 I deemed her spent had not the soft breast heaved
 As gently as a babes and even in dreams
 Two crystal drops oozed from her swollen lids
 And trickled down her cheeks Her grief sleeps not
 Although the fragile body craves its rest


 ABBESS
 Poor child I fear she hath sore need of prayer
 Hath she yet spoken


 LAYSISTER
 Only such scant words
 Of thanks or answer as our proffered service
 Or questionings demand When we are silent
 Even if she wake she seemeth unaware
 Of any presence She will sit and wail
 Rocking upon the ground with dull wide eyes
 Wherefrom the streaming tears unceasing course
 The only sound that then escapes her lips
 Is Father Father in such piteous strain
 As though her rent heart bled to utter it


 ABBESS
 Still she abides then by her first request
 To take the black veil and its vows tomorrow


 LAYSISTER
 Yea to that purpose desperately she clings
 This evening if she rouse she makes confession
 Even now a holy friar waits without
 Fra Bruno of the order of Carthusians
 Beyond Palermo


 ABBESS
 I will speak with him
 Ere he confess her since we know him not
 Follow me child and see if she have waked
 Exeunt



 SCENE III

 A Cell in the Nunnery MARIA discovered asleep on a straw
 pallet She starts suddenly from her sleep with a little cry
 half rises and remains seated on her pallet


 MARIA
 Oh that wild dream My weary bones still ache
 With the fierce pain they wrenched me limb from limb
 Thou hadst full cause my father But thou Juan
 What was my sin to thee save too much love
 Oh would to God my back were crooked with age
 My smooth cheek seamed with wrinkles my bright hair
 Hoary with years and my quick blood impeded
 By sluggish torpor so were I near the end
 Of woes that seem eternal I am strong
 Death will not rescue me Within my veins
 I feel the vigorous pulses of young life
 Refusing my release My heart at times
 Rebels against the habit of despair
 And ere I am aware has wandered back
 Among forbidden paths What prayer what penance
 Will shrive me clean before the sight of heaven
 My hands are black with parricide Why else
 Should his dead face arise three nights before me
 Bleached ghastly dripping as of one thats drowned
 To freeze my heart with horror Christ have mercy
 She covers her face with her hands in an agony of despair

 Enter a MONK


 THE MONK
 May peace be in this place
 MARIA shudders violently at the sound of his voice looks up and
 sees the MONK with bent head and hands partially extended as one
 who invokes a blessing She rises falls at his feet and takes the
 hem of his skirt between her hands pressing it to he lips


 MARIA
 Welcome thrice welcome
 Bid me not rise nor bless me with pure hands
 Ask not to see my face Here let me lie
 Kissing the dusta castaway a traitress
 A murderess a parricide


 MONK
 Accursed
 With all Hells curses is the crime thou namst
 What devil moved thee Who and whence art thou
 That wearst the form of woman though thou lackst
 The heart of the shewolf Who was thy parent
 What fiend of torture that thine impious hands
 Should quench the living source of thine own life


 MARIA
 Spare me oh spare me Nay my hands are clean
 He was the first best noblest among men
 I was his light his soul his breath of life
 These I withdrew from him and made his days
 A darkness Yet perchance he is not dead
 And blood and tears may wash away my guilt
 Oh tell me there is hope though it gleam far
 One solitary ray one steadfast spark
 Beyond a million years of purgatory
 My burning soul thirsts for the dewy balm
 Of comfortable grace One word one word
 Or ere I perish of despair


 MONK
 What word
 The one wherewith thou badst thy father hope
 What though he be not dead Is breathing life
 Hast thou not murdered him in spirit dealt
 The deathblow to his heart Cheat not thy soul
 With empty dreamsthy God hath judged ye guilty


 MARIA
 Have pity father Let me tell thee all
 Thou cloistered holy and austere knowst not
 My glittering temptations My betrayer
 Was of an angels aspect His were all gifts
 All grace all seeming virtue I was plunged
 Deaf dumb and blind and handbound in the deep
 If a poor drowning creature craved thine aid
 Thou wouldst not spurn it Such a one am I
 And all the waves roll over me Wrest me from my doom
 Say not that I am lost


 MONK
 I can but say
 What the just Spirit prompts Myself am naught
 To pardon or condemn The sin is sinned
 The fruit forbid is tasted yea and pressed
 Of its last honeyed juices Wilt thou now
 Escape the afterbitterness with prayers
 Scourgings and wringings of the hands Shall these
 Undo what has been donemake whole the heart
 Thy crime hath snapt in twainrestore the wits
 Thy sin hath scattered No Thy punishment
 Is huge as thine offence Death shall not help
 Neither shall pious life wash out the stain
 Living thourt doomed and dead thou shalt be lost
 Beyond salvation


 MARIA springing to her feet
 Impious priest thou liest
 God will have mercyas my father would
 Could he but see me in mine agony
 The MONK throws back his cowl and discovers himself as the
 SPAGNOLETTO MARIA utters a piercing cry and throws herself
 speechless at his feet


 RIBERA
 Thou knowst me not I am not what I was
 My outward shape remains unchanged these eyes
 Now gloating on thine anguish are the same
 That wept to see a shadow cross thy brow
 These ears that drink the music of thy groans
 Shrank from thy lightest sigh of melancholy
 Thou thinkst to find the father in me still
 Thy parricidal hands have murdered him
 Thou shalt not find a man I am the spirit
 Of blind revengea brute unswerving force
 What deemest thou hath bound me unto life
 Ambition pleasure or the sense of fear
 What but the sure hope of this fierce glad hour
 That I might track thee down to thismight see
 Thy tortured body writhe beneath my feet
 And blast thy stricken spirit with my curse


 MARIA in a crushed voice
 Have mercy mercy


 RIBERA
 Yes I will have mercy
 The mercy of the tiger or the wolf
 Athirst for blood


 MARIA terrorstruck rises upon her knees in an attitude of
 supplication RIBERA averts his face
 Oh father kill me not
 Turn not awayI am not changed for thee
 In Gods name look at methy child thine own
 Spare me oh spare me till I win of Heaven
 Some sign of promise I am lost forever
 If I die now


 RIBERA looks at her in silence then pushing her from him laughs
 bitterly
 Nay have no fear of me
 I would not do thee that much grace to ease thee
 Of the gross burden of the flesh Behold
 Thou shalt be cursed with weary length of days
 And when thou seekst to purge thy guilty heart
 Thou shalt find there a sin no prayer may shrive
 The murder of thy father To all dreams
 That haunt thee of past anguish shall be added
 The vision of this horror
 He draws from his girdle a dagger and stabs himself to the heart
 he falls and dies and MARIA flings herself swooning upon his body
