CHAPTER I TREATING OF A NOVEL STYLE OF DWELLING HOUSE


For some months after our marriage Euphemia and I boarded But we did
not like it Indeed there was no reason why we should like it Euphemia
said that she never felt at home except when she was out which feeling
indicating such an excessively unphilosophic state of mind was enough
to make me desire to have a home of my own where except upon rare and
exceptional occasions my wife would never care to go out

If you should want to rent a house there are three ways to find one
One way is to advertise another is to read the advertisements of other
people This is a comparatively cheap way A third method is to apply to
an agent But none of these plans are worth anything The proper way
is to know some one who will tell you of a house that will exactly suit
you Euphemia and I thoroughly investigated this matter and I know that
what I say is a fact

We tried all the plans When we advertised we had about a dozen
admirable answers but in these although everything seemed to suit the
amount of rent was not named None of those in which the rent was named
would do at all And when I went to see the owners or agents of these
suitable houses they asked much higher rents than those mentioned in
the unavailable answersand this notwithstanding the fact that they
always asserted that their terms were either very reasonable or else
greatly reduced on account of the season being advanced It was now the
fifteenth of May

Euphemia and I once wrote a bookthis was just before we were
marriedin which we told young married people how to go to
housekeeping and how much it would cost them We knew all about it for
we had asked several people Now the prices demanded as yearly rental
for small furnished houses by the owners and agents of whom I have been
speaking were in many cases more than we had stated a house could be
bought and furnished for

The advertisements of other people did not serve any better There was
always something wrong about the houses when we made close inquiries
and the trouble was generally in regard to the rent With agents we
had a little better fortune Euphemia sometimes went with me on my
expeditions to real estate offices and she remarked that these offices
were always in the basement or else you had to go up to them in an
elevator There was nothing between these extremes And it was a good
deal the same way she said with their houses They were all very low
indeed in price and quality or else too high

One trouble was that we wanted a house in a country place not very far
from the city and not very far from the railroad station or steamboat
landing We also wanted the house to be nicely shaded and fully
furnished and not to be in a malarial neighborhood or one infested by
mosquitoes

If we do go to housekeeping said Euphemia we might as well get a
house to suit us while we are about it Moving is more expensive than a
fire

There was one man who offered us a house that almost suited us It was
near the water had rooms enough and somebut not very muchground
and was very accessible to the city The rent too was quite
reasonable But the house was unfurnished The agent however did not
think that this would present any obstacle to our taking it He was
sure that the owner would furnish it if we paid him ten per cent on the
value of the furniture he put into it We agreed that if the landlord
would do this and let us furnish the house according to the plans laid
down in our book that we would take the house But unfortunately this
arrangement did not suit the landlord although he was in the habit of
furnishing houses for tenants and charging them ten per cent on the
cost

I saw him myself and talked to him about it

But you see said he when I had shown him our list of articles
necessary for the furnishing of a house it would not pay me to buy
all these things and rent them out to you If you only wanted heavy
furniture which would last for years the plan would answer but you
want everything I believe the small conveniences you have on this list
come to more money than the furniture and carpets

Oh yes said I We are not so very particular about furniture
and carpets but these little conveniences are the things that make
housekeeping pleasant andspeaking from a commonsense point of
viewprofitable

That may be he answered but I cant afford to make matters pleasant
and profitable for you in that way Now then let us look at one or two
particulars Here on your list is an icepick twentyfive cents
Now if I buy that icepick and rent it to you at two and ahalf cents
a year I shall not get my money back unless it lasts you ten years And
even then as it is not probable that I can sell that icepick after
you have used it for ten years I shall have made nothing at all by
my bargain And there are other things in that list such as
featherdusters and lampchimneys that couldnt possibly last ten
years Dont you see my position

I saw it We did not get that furnished house Euphemia was greatly
disappointed

It would have been just splendid she said to have taken our book
and have ordered all these things at the stores one after another
without even being obliged to ask the price

I had my private doubts in regard to this matter of price I am afraid
that Euphemia generally set down the lowest price and the best things
She did not mean to mislead and her plan certainly made our book
attractive But it did not work very well in practice We have a friend
who undertook to furnish her house by our book and she never could get
the things as cheaply as we had them quoted

But you see said Euphemia to her we had to put them down at very
low prices because the model house we speak of in the book is to be
entirely furnished for just so much

But in spite of this explanation the lady was not satisfied

We found ourselves obliged to give up the idea of a furnished house We
would have taken an unfurnished one and furnished it ourselves but we
had not money enough We were dreadfully afraid that we should have to
continue to board

It was now getting on toward summer at least there was only a part of
a month of spring left and whenever I could get off from my business
Euphemia and I made little excursions into the country round about the
city One afternoon we went up the river and there we saw a sight that
transfixed us as it were On the bank a mile or so above the city
stood a canalboat I say stood because it was so firmly imbedded
in the ground by the riverside that it would have been almost as
impossible to move it as to have turned the Sphinx around This boat we
soon found was inhabited by an oysterman and his family They had lived
there for many years and were really doing quite well The boat was
divided inside into rooms and these were papered and painted and
nicely furnished There was a kitchen a livingroom a parlor and
bedrooms There were all sorts of conveniencescarpets on the floors
pictures and everything at least so it seemed to us to make a home
comfortable This was not all done at once the oysterman told me They
had lived there for years and had gradually added this and that until
the place was as we saw it He had an oysterbed out in the river and
he made cider in the winter but where he got the apples I dont know
There was really no reason why he should not get rich in time

Well we went all over that house and we praised everything so much that
the oystermans wife was delighted and when we had some stewed oysters
afterwardeating them at a little table under a tree near byI
believe that she picked out the very largest oysters she had to stew
for us When we had finished our supper and had paid for it and were
going down to take our little boat againfor we had rowed up the
riverEuphemia stopped and looked around her Then she clasped her
hands and exclaimed in an ecstatic undertone

We must have a canalboat

And she never swerved from that determination

After I had seriously thought over the matter I could see no good
reason against adopting this plan It would certainly be a cheap method
of living and it would really be housekeeping I grew more and more in
favor of it After what the oysterman had done what might not we do
HE had never written a book on housekeeping nor in all probability
had he considered the matter philosophically for one moment in all his
life

But it was not an easy thing to find a canalboat There were none
advertised for rentat least not for housekeeping purposes

We made many inquiries and took many a long walk along the watercourses
in the vicinity of the city but all in vain Of course we talked a
great deal about our project and our friends became greatly interested
in it and of course too they gave us a great deal of advice but we
didnt mind that We were philosophical enough to know that you cant
have shad without bones They were good friends and by being careful in
regard to the advice it didnt interfere with our comfort

We were beginning to be discouraged at least Euphemia was Her
discouragement is like watercresses it generally comes up in a very
short time after she sows her wishes But then it withers away rapidly
which is a comfort One evening we were sitting rather disconsolately
in our room and I was reading out the advertisements of country board
in a newspaper when in rushed Dr Heareone of our old friends He was
so full of something that he had to say that he didnt even ask us how
we were In fact he didnt appear to want to know

I tell you what it is said he I have found just the very thing you
want

A canalboat I cried

Yes said he a canalboat

Furnished asked Euphemia her eyes glistening

Well no answered the doctor I dont think you could expect that

But we cant live on the bare floor said Euphemia our house MUST be
furnished

Well then I suppose this wont do said the doctor ruefully for
there isnt so much as a bootjack in it It has most things that
are necessary for a boat but it hasnt anything that you could call
housefurniture but dear me I should think you could furnish it very
cheaply and comfortably out of your book

Very true said Euphemia if we could pick out the cheapest things
and then get some folks to buy a lot of the books

We could begin with very little said I trying hard to keep calm

Certainly said the doctor you need make no more rooms at first
than you could furnish

Then there are no rooms said Euphemia

No there is nothing but one vast apartment extending from stem to
stern

Wont it be glorious said Euphemia to me We can first make a
kitchen and then a diningroom and a bedroom and then a parlorjust
in the order in which our book says they ought to be furnished

Glorious I cried no longer able to contain my enthusiasm I should
think so Doctor where is this canalboat

The doctor then went into a detailed statement The boat was stranded
on the shore of the Scoldsbury river not far below Ginxs We knew where
Ginxs was because we had spent a very happy day there during our
honeymoon

The boat was a good one but superannuated That however did not
interfere with its usefulness as a dwelling We could get itthe doctor
had seen the ownerfor a small sum per annum and here was positively
no end to its capabilities

We sat up until twenty minutes past two talking about that house We
ceased to call it a boat at about a quarter of eleven

The next day I took the boat and paid a months rent in advance Three
days afterward we moved into it

We had not much to move which was a comfort looking at it from one
point of view A carpenter had put up two partitions in it which made
three roomsa kitchen a diningroom and a very long bedroom which
was to be cut up into a parlor study spareroom etc as soon as
circumstances should allow or my salary should be raised Originally
all the doors and windows were in the roof so to speak but our
landlord allowed us to make as many windows to the side of the boat
as we pleased provided we gave him the wood we cut out It saved him
trouble he said but I did not understand him at the time Accordingly
the carpenter made several windows for us and put in sashes which
opened on hinges like the hasp of a trunk Our furniture did not amount
to much at first The very thought of living in this independent
romantic way was so delightful Euphemia said that furniture seemed a
mere secondary matter

We were obliged indeed to give up the idea of following the plan
detailed in our book because we hadnt the sum upon which the
furnishing of a small house was therein based

And if we havent the money remarked Euphemia it would be of no
earthly use to look at the book It would only make us doubt our own
calculations You might as well try to make brick without mortar as the
children of Israel did

I could do that myself my dear said I but we wont discuss that
subject now We will buy just what we absolutely need and then work up
from that

Acting on this plan we bought first a small stove because Euphemia
said that we could sleep on the floor if it were necessary but we
couldnt make a fire on the floorat least not often Then we got
a table and two chairs The next thing we purchased was some hanging
shelves for our books and Euphemia suddenly remembered the kitchen
things These which were few with some crockery nearly brought us to
the end of our resources but we had enough for a big easychair which
Euphemia was determined I should have because I really needed it when
I came home at night tired with my long days work at the office I had
always been used to an easychair and it was one of her most delightful
dreams to see me in a real nice one comfortably smoking my pipe in my
own house after eating my own delicious little supper in company with
my own dear wife We selected the chair and then we were about to order
the things sent out to our future home when I happened to think that we
had no bed I called Euphemias attention to the fact

She was thunderstruck

I never thought of that she said We shall have to give up the
stove

Not at all said I we cant do that We must give up the
easychair

Oh that would be too bad said she The house would seem like
nothing to me without the chair

But we must do without it my dear said I at least for a while I
can sit out on deck and smoke of an evening you know

Yes said Euphemia You can sit on the bulwarks and I can sit by you
That will do very well Im sure Im glad the boat has bulwarks

So we resigned the easychair and bought a bedstead and some very plain
bedding The bedstead was what is sometimes called a scissorsbed
We could shut it up when we did not want to sleep in it and stand it
against the wall

When we packed up our trunks and left the boardinghouse Euphemia fairly
skipped with joy

We went down to Ginxs in the first boat having arranged that our
furniture should be sent to us in the afternoon We wanted to be there
to receive it The trip was just wildly delirious The air was charming
The sun was bright and I had a whole holiday When we reached Ginxs we
found that the best way to get our trunks and ourselves to our house was
to take a carriage and so we took one I told the driver to drive along
the river road and I would tell him where to stop

When we reached our boat and had alighted I said to the driver

You can just put our trunks inside anywhere

The man looked at the trunks and then looked at the boat Afterward he
looked at me

That boat aint goin anywhere said he

I should think not said Euphemia We shouldnt want to live in it
if it were

You are going to live in it said the man

Yes said Euphemia

Oh said the man and he took our trunks on board without another
word

It was not very easy for him to get the trunks into our new home
In fact it was not easy for us to get there ourselves There was a
gangplank with a rail on one side of it which inclined from the shore
to the deck of the boat at an angle of fortyfive degrees and when the
man had staggered up this plank with the trunks Euphemia said I ought
to have helped him but I really thought that it would be better for one
person to fall off the plank than for two to go over together and
we had paid him and he had driven away in a speechless condition we
scrambled up and stood upon the threshold or rather the afterdeck of
our home

It was a proud moment Euphemia glanced around her eyes full of happy
tears and then she took my arm and we went down stairsat least we
tried to go down in that fashion but soon found it necessary to go one
at a time We wandered over the whole extent of our mansion and found
that our carpenter had done his work better than the woman whom we had
engaged to scrub and clean the house Something akin to despair must
have seized upon her for Euphemia declared that the floors looked
dirtier than on the occasion of her first visit when we rented the
boat

But that didnt discourage us We felt sure that we should get it clean
in time

Early in the afternoon our furniture arrived together with the other
things we had bought and the men who brought them over from the
steamboat landing had the brightest merriest faces I ever noticed among
that class of people Euphemia said it was an excellent omen to
have such cheerful fellows come to us on the very first day of our
housekeeping

Then we went to work I put up the stove which was not much trouble
as there was a place all ready in the deck for the stovepipe to be run
through Euphemia was somewhat surprised at the absence of a chimney
but I assured her that boats were very seldom built with chimneys My
dear little wife bustled about and arranged the pots and kettles on
nails that I drove into the kitchen walls Then she made the bed in the
bedroom and I hung up a lookingglass and a few little pictures that we
had brought in our trunks

Before four oclock our house was in order Then we began to be very
hungry

My dear said Euphemia we ought to have thought to bring something
to cook

That is very true said I but I think perhaps we had better walk
up to Ginxs and get our supper tonight You see we are so tired and
hungry

What cried Euphemia go to a hotel the very first day I think it
would be dreadful Why I have been looking forward to this first meal
with the greatest delight You can go up to the little store by the
hotel and buy some things and I will cook them and we will have our
first dear little meal here all alone by ourselves at our own table and
in our own house

So this was determined upon and after a hasty counting of the fund I
had reserved for moving and kindred expenses and which had been sorely
depleted during the day I set out and in about an hour returned with
my first marketing

I made a fire using a lot of chips and blocks the carpenter had left
and Euphemia cooked the supper and we ate it from our little table
with two large towels for a tablecloth

It was the most delightful meal I ever ate

And when we had finished Euphemia washed the dishes the thoughtful
creature had put some water on the stove to heat for the purpose
while we were at supper and then we went on deck or on the piazza as
Euphemia thought we had better call it and there we had our smoke I
say WE for Euphemia always helps me to smoke by sitting by me and she
seems to enjoy it as much as I do

And when the shades of evening began to gather around us I hauled in
the gangplank just like a delightful old drawbridge Euphemia said
although I hope for the sake of our ancestors that drawbridges were
easier to haul in and went to bed

It is lucky we were tired and wanted to go to bed early for we had
forgotten all about lamps or candles

For the next week we were two busy and happy people I rose about
halfpast five and made the firewe found so much wood on the shore
that I thought I should not have to add fuel to my expensesand
Euphemia cooked the breakfast I then went to a well belonging to a
cottage near by where we had arranged for waterprivileges and filled
two buckets with delicious water and carried them home for Euphemias
use through the day Then I hurried off to catch the train for as
there was a station near Ginxs I ceased to patronize the steamboat
the hours of which were not convenient After a day of work and
pleasurable anticipation at the office I hastened back to my home
generally laden with a basket of provisions and various household
necessities Milk was brought to us daily from the abovementioned
cottage by a little toddler who seemed just able to carry the small tin
bucket which held a lacteal pint If the urchin had been the child of
rich parents as Euphemia sometimes observed he would have been in his
nurses armsbut being poor he was scarcely weaned before he began to
carry milk around to other people

After I reached home came supper and the delightful evening hours
when over my pipe I had given up cigars as being too expensive and
inappropriate and had taken to a tall pipe and canaster tobacco we
talked and planned and told each other our days experience

One of our earliest subjects of discussion was the name of our
homestead Euphemia insisted that it should have a name I was quite
willing but we found it no easy matter to select an appropriate title
I proposed a number of appellations intended to suggest the character of
our home Among these were Safe Ashore Firmly Grounded and some
other names of that style but Euphemia did not fancy any of them She
wanted a suitable name of course she said but it must be something
that would SOUND like a house and BE like a boat

Partitionville she objected to and Gangplank Terrace did not suit
her because it suggested convicts going out to work which naturally was
unpleasant

At last after days of talk and cogitation we named our house Rudder
Grange

To be sure it wasnt exactly a grange but then it had such an enormous
rudder that the justice of that part of the title seemed to overbalance
any little inaccuracy in the other portion

But we did not spend all our spare time in talking An hour or two
every evening was occupied in what we called fixing the house and
gradually the inside of our abode began to look like a conventional
dwelling We put matting on the floors and cheap but very pretty paper
on the walls We added now a couple of chairs and now a table or
something for the kitchen Frequently especially of a Sunday we had
company and our guests were always charmed with Euphemias cunning
little meals The dear girl loved good eating so much that she could
scarcely fail to be a good cook

We worked hard and were very happy And thus the weeks passed on



CHAPTER II TREATING OF A NOVEL STYLE OF BOARDER


In this delightful way of living only one thing troubled us We didnt
save any money There were so many little things that we wanted and so
many little things that were so cheap that I spent pretty much all
I made and that was far from the philosophical plan of living that I
wished to follow

We talked this matter over a great deal after we had lived in our new
home for about a month and we came at last to the conclusion that we
would take a boarder

We had no trouble in getting a boarder for we had a friend a young man
who was engaged in the flour business who was very anxious to come
and live with us He had been to see us two or three times and had
expressed himself charmed with our household arrangements

So we made terms with him The carpenter partitioned off another room
and our boarder brought his trunk and a large red velvet armchair and
took up his abode at Rudder Grange

We liked our boarder very much but he had some peculiarities I suppose
everybody has them Among other things he was very fond of telling us
what we ought to do He suggested more improvements in the first three
days of his sojourn with us than I had thought of since we commenced
housekeeping And what made the matter worse his suggestions were
generally very good ones Had it been otherwise I might have borne his
remarks more complacently but to be continually told what you ought to
do and to know that you ought to do it is extremely annoying

He was very anxious that I should take off the rudder which was
certainly useless to a boat situated as ours was and make an
ironingtable of it I persisted that the laws of symmetrical propriety
required that the rudder should remain where it wasthat the very name
of our home would be interfered with by its removal but he insisted
that Ironingtable Grange would be just as good a name and that
symmetrical propriety in such a case did not amount to a row of pins

The result was that we did have the ironingtable and that Euphemia
was very much pleased with it A great many other improvements were
projected and carried out by him and I was very much worried He made
a flowergarden for Euphemia on the extreme forwarddeck and having
borrowed a wheelbarrow he wheeled dozens of loads of arable dirt up
our gangplank and dumped them out on the deck When he had covered
the garden with a suitable depth of earth he smoothed it off and then
planted flowerseeds It was rather late in the season but most of
them came up I was pleased with the garden but sorry I had not made it
myself

One afternoon I got away from the office considerably earlier than
usual and I hurried home to enjoy the short period of daylight that I
should have before supper It had been raining the day before and as
the bottom of our garden leaked so that earthy water trickled down at
one end of our bedroom I intended to devote a short time to stuffing
up the cracks in the ceiling or bottom of the deckwhichever seems the
most appropriate

But when I reached a bend in the river road whence I always had the
earliest view of my establishment I did not have that view I
hurried on The nearer I approached the place where I lived the more
horrorstricken I became There was no mistaking the fact

The boat was not there

In an instant the truth flashed upon me

The water was very highthe rain had swollen the rivermy house had
floated away

It was Wednesday On Wednesday afternoons our boarder came home early

I clapped my hat tightly on my head and ground my teeth

Confound that boarder I thought He has been fooling with the
anchor He always said it was of no use and taking advantage of my
absence he has hauled it up and has floated away and has gonegone
with my wife and my home

Euphemia and Rudder Grange had gone off togetherwhere I knew
notand with them that horrible suggester

I ran wildly along the bank I called aloud I shouted and hailed each
passing craftof which there were only twobut their crews must have
been very inattentive to the woes of landsmen or else they did not hear
me for they paid no attention to my cries

I met a fellow with an axe on his shoulder I shouted to him before I
reached him

Hello did you see a boata house I meanfloating up the river

A boathouse asked the man

No a houseboat I gasped

Didnt see nuthin like it said the man and he passed on to his
wife and home no doubt But me Oh where was my wife and my home

I met several people but none of them had seen a fugitive canalboat

How many thoughts came into my brain as I ran along that river road If
that wretched boarder had not taken the rudder for an ironing table he
might have steered in shore Again and again I confoundedas far as
mental ejaculations could do ithis suggestions

I was rapidly becoming frantic when I met a person who hailed me

Hello he said are you after a canalboat adrift

Yes I panted

I thought you was he said You looked that way Well I can tell you
where she is Shes stuck fast in the reeds at the lower end o Peters
Pint

Wheres that said I

Oh its about a mile furder up I seed her adriftin up with the
tidebig flood tide todayand I thought Id see somebody after her
afore long Anything aboard

Anything

I could not answer the man Anything indeed I hurried on up the river
without a word Was the boat a wreck I scarcely dared to think of it I
scarcely dared to think at all

The man called after me and I stopped I could but stop no matter what
I might hear

Hello mister he said got any tobacco

I walked up to him I took hold of him by the lapel of his coat It was
a dirty lapel as I remember even now but I didnt mind that

Look here said I Tell me the truth I can bear it Was that vessel
wrecked

The man looked at me a little queerly I could not exactly interpret his
expression

Youre sure you kin bear it said he

Yes said I my hand trembling as I held his coat

Well then said he its morn I kin and he jerked his coat out of
my hand and sprang away When he reached the other side of the road he
turned and shouted at me as though I had been deaf

Do you know what I think he yelled I think youre a darned
lunatic and with that he went his way

I hastened on to Peters Point Long before I reached it I saw the
boat

It was apparently deserted But still I pressed on I must know the
worst When I reached the Point I found that the boat had run aground
with her head in among the long reeds and mud and the rest of her hull
lying at an angle from the shore

There was consequently no way for me to get on board but to wade
through the mud and reeds to her bow and then climb up as well as I
could

This I did but it was not easy to do Twice I sank above my knees
in mud and water and had it not been for reeds masses of which I
frequently clutched when I thought I was going over I believe I should
have fallen down and come to my death in that horrible marsh When
I reached the boat I stood up to my hips in water and saw no way of
climbing up The gangplank had undoubtedly floated away and if it had
not it would have been of no use to me in my position

But I was desperate I clasped the post that they put in the bow of
canalboats I stuck my toes and my fingernails in the cracks between
the boardshow glad I was that the boat was an old one and had
cracksand so painfully and slowly slipping part way down once or
twice and besliming myself from chin to foot I climbed up that post
and scrambled upon deck In an instant I reached the top of the stairs
and in another instant I rushed below

There sat my wife and our boarder one on each side of the diningroom
table complacently playing checkers

My sudden entrance startled them My appearance startled them still
more

Euphemia sprang to her feet and tottered toward me

Mercy she exclaimed has anything happened

Happened I gasped

Look here cried the boarder clutching me by the arm what a
condition youre in Did you fall in

Fall in said I

Euphemia and the boarder looked at each other I looked at them Then I
opened my mouth in earnest

I suppose you dont know I yelled that you have drifted away

By George cried the boarder and in two bounds he was on deck

Dirty as I was Euphemia fell into my arms I told her all She hadnt
known a bit of it

The boat had so gently drifted off and had so gently grounded among
the reeds that the voyage had never so much as disturbed their games of
checkers

He plays such a splendid game Euphemia sobbed and just as you came
I thought I was going to beat him I had two kings and two pieces on the
next to last row and you are nearly drowned Youll get your death of
coldandand he had only one king

She led me away and I undressed and washed myself and put on my Sunday
clothes

When I reappeared I went out on deck with Euphemia The boarder was
there standing by the petunia bed His arms were folded and he was
thinking profoundly As we approached he turned toward us

You were right about that anchor he said I should not have hauled
it in but it was such a little anchor that I thought it would be of
more use on board as a garden hoe

A very little anchor will sometimes do very well said I cuttingly
when it is hooked around a tree

Yes there is something in that said he

It was now growing late and as our agitation subsided we began to be
hungry Fortunately we had everything necessary on board and as it
really didnt make any difference in our household economy where we
happened to be located we had supper quite as usual In fact the
kettle had been put on to boil during the checkerplaying

After supper we went on deck to smoke as was our custom but there was
a certain coolness between me and our boarder

Early the next morning I arose and went upstairs to consider what had
better be done when I saw the boarder standing on shore near by

Hello he cried the tides down and I got ashore without any
trouble You stay where you are Ive hired a couple of mules to tow the
boat back Theyll be here when the tide rises And hello Ive found
the gangplank It floated ashore about a quarter of a mile below here

In the course of the afternoon the mules and two men with a long rope
appeared and we were then towed back to where we belonged

And we are there yet Our boarder remains with us as the weather is
still fine and the coolness between us is gradually diminishing But
the boat is moored at both ends and twice a day I look to see if the
ropes are all right

The petunias are growing beautifully but the geraniums do not seem to
flourish Perhaps there is not a sufficient depth of earth for them
Several times our boarder has appeared to be on the point of suggesting
something in regard to them but for some reason or other he says
nothing



CHAPTER III TREATING OF A NOVEL STYLE OF GIRL


One afternoon as I was hurrying down Broadway to catch the five oclock
train I met Waterford He is an old friend of mine and I used to like
him pretty well

Hello said he where are you going

Home I answered

Is that so said he I didnt know you had one

I was a little nettled at this and so I said somewhat brusquely
perhaps

But you must have known I lived somewhere

Oh yes But I thought you boarded said he I had no idea that you
had a home

But I have one and a very pleasant home too You must excuse me for
not stopping longer as I must catch my train

Oh Ill walk along with you said Waterford and so we went down the
street together

Where is your little house he asked

Why in the world he thought it was a little house I could not at the
time imagine unless he supposed that two people would not require
a large one But I know now that he lived in a very little house
himself

But it was of no use getting angry with Waterford especially as I saw
he intended walking all the way down to the ferry with me so I told him
I didnt live in any house at all

Why where DO you live he exclaimed stopping short

I live in a boat said I

A boat A sort of Rob Roy arrangement I suppose Well I would not
have thought that of you And your wife I suppose has gone home to her
people

She has done nothing of the kind I answered She lives with me and
she likes it very much We are extremely comfortable and our boat is
not a canoe or any such nonsensical affair It is a large commodious
canalboat

Waterford turned around and looked at me

Are you a deckhand he asked

Deckgrandmother I exclaimed

Well you neednt get mad about it he said I didnt mean to
hurt your feelings but I couldnt see what else you could be on a
canalboat I dont suppose for instance that youre captain

But I am said I

Look here said Waterford this is coming it rather strong isnt
it

As I saw he was getting angry I told him all about ittold him how we
had hired a stranded canalboat and had fitted it up as a house and how
we lived so cosily in it and had called it Rudder Grange and how we
had taken a boarder

Well said he this is certainly surprising Im coming out to see
you some day It will be better than going to Barnums

I told himit is the way of societythat we would be glad to see him
and we parted Waterford never did come to see us and I merely mention
this incident to show how some of our friends talked about Rudder
Grange when they first heard that we lived there

After dinner that evening when I went up on deck with Euphemia to have
my smoke we saw the boarder sitting on the bulwarks near the garden
with his legs dangling down outside

Look here said he

I looked but there was nothing unusual to see

What is it I asked

He turned around and seeing Euphemia said

Nothing

It would be a very stupid person who could not take such a hint as that
and so after a walk around the garden Euphemia took occasion to go
below to look at the kitchen fire

As soon as she had gone the boarder turned to me and said

Ill tell you what it is Shes working herself sick

Sick said I Nonsense

No nonsense about it he replied

The truth was that the boarder was right and I was wrong We had spent
several months at Rudder Grange and during this time Euphemia had
been working very hard and she really did begin to look pale and
thin Indeed it would be very wearying for any woman of culture and
refinement unused to housework to cook and care for two men and to
do all the work of a canalboat besides

But I saw Euphemia so constantly and thought so much of her and had
her image so continually in my heart that I did not notice this until
our boarder now called my attention to it I was sorry that he had to do
it

If I were in your place said he I would get her a servant

If you were in my place I replied somewhat cuttingly you would
probably suggest a lot of little things which would make everything very
easy for her

Id try to he answered without getting in the least angry

Although I felt annoyed that he had suggested it still I made up my
mind that Euphemia must have a servant

She agreed quite readily when I proposed the plan and she urged me
to go and see the carpenter that very day and get him to come and
partition off a little room for the girl

It was some time of course before the room was made for who ever
heard of a carpenter coming at the very time he was wanted and when
it was finished Euphemia occupied all her spare moments in getting it
in nice order for the servant when she should come I thought she was
taking too much trouble but she had her own ideas about such things

If a girl is lodged like a pig you must expect her to behave like a
pig and I dont want that kind

So she put up pretty curtains at the girls window and with a box that
she stood on end and some old muslin and a lot of tacks she made a
toilettable so neat and convenient that I thought she ought to take it
into our room and give the servant our washstand

But all this time we had no girl and as I had made up my mind about the
matter I naturally grew impatient and at last I determined to go and
get a girl myself

So one day at lunchtime I went to an intelligence office in the city
There I found a large room on the second floor and some ladies and one
or two men sitting about and a small room back of it crowded with
girls from eighteen to sixtyeight years old There were also girls upon
the stairs and girls in the hall below besides some girls standing on
the sidewalk before the door

When I made known my business and had paid my fee one of the several
proprietors who were wandering about the front room went into the
back apartment and soon returned with a tall Irishwoman with a bony
weatherbeaten face and a large weatherbeaten shawl This woman was
told to take a chair by my side Down sat the huge creature and stared
at me I did not feel very easy under her scrutinizing gaze but I bore
it as best I could and immediately began to ask her all the appropriate
questions that I could think of Some she answered satisfactorily and
some she didnt answer at all but as soon as I made a pause she began
to put questions herself

How many servants do you kape she asked

I answered that we intended to get along with one and if she understood
her business I thought she would find her work very easy and the place
a good one

She turned sharp upon me and said

Have ye stationary washtubs

I hesitated I knew our washtubs were not stationary for I had helped
to carry them about But they might be screwed fast and made stationary
if that was an important object But before making this answer
I thought of the great conveniences for washing presented by our
residence surrounded as it was at high tide by water

Why we live in a stationary washtub I said smiling

The woman looked at me steadfastly for a minute and then she rose
to her feet Then she called out as if she were crying fish or
strawberries

Mrs Blaine

The female keeper of the intelligence office and the male keeper and
a thin clerk and all the women in the back room and all the patrons in
the front room jumped up and gathered around us

Astonished and somewhat disconcerted I rose to my feet and confronted
the tall Irishwoman and stood smiling in an uncertain sort of a way as
if it were all very funny but I couldnt see the point I think I must
have impressed the people with the idea that I wished I hadnt come

He says exclaimed the woman as if some other huckster were crying
fish on the other side of the streethe says he lives in a washtoob

Hes crazy ejaculated Mrs Blaine with an air that indicated
policeman as plainly as if she had put her thought into words

A low murmur ran through the crowd of women while the thin clerk edged
toward the door

I saw there was no time to lose I stepped back a little from the tall
savage who was breathing like a hotair engine in front of me and made
my explanations to the company I told the tale of Rudder Grange and
showed them how it was like to a stationary washtubat certain stages
of the tide

I was listened to with great attention When I had finished the tall
woman turned around and faced the assemblage

An he wants a cook to make soup In a canalboat said she and off
she marched into the backroom followed closely by all the other women

I dont think we have any one here who would suit you said Mrs
Blaine

I didnt think so either What on earth would Euphemia have done with
that volcanic Irishwoman in her little kitchen I took up my hat and
bade Mrs Blaine good morning

Good morning said she with a distressing smile

She had one of those mouths that look exactly like a gash in the face

I went home without a girl In a day or two Euphemia came to town and
got one Apparently she got her without any trouble but I am not sure

She went to a HomeSaint Somebodys Homea place where they keep
orphans to let so to speak Here Euphemia selected a lighthaired
mediumsized orphan and brought her home

The girls name was Pomona Whether or not her parents gave her this
name is doubtful At any rate she did not seem quite decided in her
mind about it herself for she had not been with us more than two weeks
before she expressed a desire to be called Clare This longing of her
heart however was denied her So Euphemia who was always correct
called her Pomona I did the same whenever I could think not to say
Bolognawhich seemed to come very pat for some reason or other

As for the boarder he generally called her Altoona connecting her in
some way with the process of stopping for refreshments in which she was
an adept

She was an earnest hearty girl She was always in a good humor and
when I asked her to do anything she assented in a bright cheerful way
and in a loud tone full of goodfellowship as though she would say

Certainly my high old cock To be sure I will Dont worry about
itgive your mind no more uneasiness on that subject Ill bring the
hot water

She did not know very much but she was delighted to learn and she was
very strong Whatever Euphemia told her to do she did instantly with a
bang What pleased her better than anything else was to run up and
down the gangplank carrying buckets of water to water the garden
She delighted in outdoor work and sometimes dug so vigorously in
our garden that she brought up pieces of the deckplanking with every
shovelful

Our boarder took the greatest interest in her and sometimes watched her
movements so intently that he let his pipe go out

What a whacking girl that would be to tread out grapes in the vineyards
of Italy Shed make wine cheap he once remarked

Then Im glad she isnt there said Euphemia for wine oughtnt to be
cheap

Euphemia was a thorough little temperance woman

The one thing about Pomona that troubled me more than anything else was
her taste for literature It was not literature to which I objected but
her very peculiar taste She would read in the kitchen every night after
she had washed the dishes but if she had not read aloud it would not
have made so much difference to me But I am naturally very sensitive to
external impressions and I do not like the company of people who like
our girl cannot read without pronouncing in a measured and distinct
voice every word of what they are reading And when the matter thus read
appeals to ones every sentiment of aversion and there is no way of
escaping it the case is hard indeed

From the first I felt inclined to order Pomona if she could not attain
the power of silent perusal to cease from reading altogether but
Euphemia would not hear to this

Poor thing said she it would be cruel to take from her her only
recreation And she says she cant read any other way You neednt
listen if you dont want to

That was all very well in an abstract point of view but the fact was
that in practice the more I didnt want to listen the more I heard

As the evenings were often cool we sat in our diningroom and the
partition between this room and the kitchen seemed to have no influence
whatever in arresting sound So that when I was trying to read or to
reflect it was by no means exhilarating to my mind to hear from the
next room that

The la dy ce sel i a now si zed the weep on and all though the boor ly
vil ly an re tain ed his vy gor ous hold she drew the blade through his
fin gers and hoorl ed it far be hind her dryp ping with jore

This sort of thing kept up for an hour or so at a time used to drive
me nearly wild But Euphemia did not mind it I believe that she had
so delicate a sense of what was proper that she did not hear Pomonas
private readings

On one occasion even Euphemias influence could scarcely restrain me
from violent interference

It was our boarders night out when he was detained in town by his
business and Pomona was sitting up to let him in This was necessary
for our frontdoor or mainhatchway had no nightlatch but was
fastened by means of a bolt Euphemia and I used to sit up for him but
that was earlier in the season when it was pleasant to be out on
deck until quite a late hour But Pomona never objected to sitting or
getting up late and so we allowed this weekly duty to devolve on her

On this particular night I was very tired and sleepy and soon after I
got into bed I dropped into a delightful slumber But it was not long
before I was awakened by the fact that

Sa rah did not fl inch but gras ped the heat ed i ron in her un in jur
ed hand and when the ra bid an i mal a proach ed she thr ust the lur id
po ker in his

My conscience said I to Euphemia cant that girl be stopped

You wouldnt have her sit there and do nothing would you said she

No but she neednt read out that way

She cant read any other way said Euphemia drowsily

Yell af ter yell res oun ded as he wil dly spr rang

I cant stand that and I wont said I Why dont she go into the
kitchenthe diningrooms no place for her

She must not sit there said Euphemia Theres a windowpane out
Cant you cover up your head

I shall not be able to breathe if I do but I suppose thats no
matter I replied

The reading continued

Ha ha Lord Mar mont thun der ed thou too shalt suf fer all that this
poor

I sprang out of bed

Euphemia thought I was going for my pistol and she gave one bound and
stuck her head out of the door

Pomona fly she cried

Yes smaam said Pomona and she got up and flewnot very fast I
imagine Where she flew to I dont know but she took the lamp with her
and I could hear distant syllables of agony and blood until the boarder
came home and Pomona went to bed

I think that this made an impression upon Euphemia for although she
did not speak to me upon the subject or any other that night the next
time I heard Pomona reading the words ran somewhat thus

The as ton ish ing che ap ness of land is ac count ed for by the want
of home mar kets of good ro ads and che ap me ans of trans por ta ti on

CHAPTER IV TREATING OF A NOVEL STYLE OF BURGLAR


I have spoken of my pistol During the early part of our residence at
Rudder Grange I never thought of such a thing as owning a pistol

But it was different now I kept a Colts revolver loaded in the bureau
drawer in our bedroom

The cause of this change was burglars Not that any of these unpleasant
persons had visited us but we much feared they would Several houses in
the vicinity had been entered during the past month and we could never
tell when our turn would come

To be sure our boarder suggested that if we were to anchor out a little
further at night no burglar would risk catching his death of cold by
swimming out to us but Euphemia having replied that it would be rather
difficult to move a canalboat every night without paddlewheels or
sails or mules especially if it were aground this plan was considered
to be effectually disposed of

So we made up our minds that we must fasten up everything very securely
and I bought a pistol and two burglaralarms One of these I affixed to
the most exposed window and the other to the door which opened on the
deck These alarms were very simple affairs but they were good enough
When they were properly attached to a window or door and it was opened
a little gong sounded like a violently deranged clock striking all the
hours of the day at once

The window did not trouble us much but it was rather irksome to have
to make the attachment to the door every night and to take it off every
morning However as Euphemia said it was better to take a little
trouble than to have the house full of burglars which was true enough

We made all the necessary arrangements in case burglars should make an
inroad upon us At the first sound of the alarm Euphemia and the girl
were to lie flat on the floor or get under their beds Then the boarder
and I were to stand up back to back each with pistol in hand and fire
away revolving on a common centre the while In this way by aiming
horizontally at about four feet from the floor we could rake the
premises and run no risk of shooting each other or the women of the
family

To be sure there were some slight objections to this plan The
boarders room was at some distance from ours and he would probably not
hear the alarm and the burglars might not be willing to wait while
I went forward and roused him up and brought him to our part of the
house But this was a minor difficulty I had no doubt but that if it
should be necessary I could manage to get our boarder into position in
plenty of time

It was not very long before there was an opportunity of testing the
plan

About twelve oclock one night one of the alarms that on the kitchen
window went off with a whirr and a wild succession of clangs For a
moment I thought the morning train had arrived and then I woke up
Euphemia was already under the bed

I hurried on a few clothes and then I tried to find the bureau in the
dark This was not easy as I lost my bearings entirely But I found it
at last got the top drawer open and took out my pistol Then I slipped
out of the room hurried up the stairs opened the door setting off the
alarm there by the way and ran along the deck there was a cold night
wind and hastily descended the steep steps that led into the boarders
room The door that was at the bottom of the steps was not fastened
and as I opened it a little stray moonlight illumed the room I
hastily stepped to the bed and shook the boarder by the shoulder He
kept HIS pistol under his pillow

In an instant he was on his feet his hand grasped my throat and
the cold muzzle of his Derringer pistol was at my forehead It was an
awfully big muzzle like the mouth of a bottle

I dont know when I lived so long as during the first minute that he
held me thus

Rascal he said Do as much as breathe and Ill pull the trigger

I didnt breathe

I had an accident insurance on my life Would it hold good in a case
like this Or would Euphemia have to go back to her father

He pushed me back into the little patch of moonlight

Oh is it you he said relaxing his grasp What do you want A
mustard plaster

He had a package of patent plasters in his room You took one and dipped
it in hot water and it was all ready

No said I gasping a little Burglars

Oh he said and he put down his pistol and put on his clothes

Come along he said and away we went over the deck

When we reached the stairs all was dark and quiet below

It was a matter of hesitancy as to going down

I started to go down first but the boarder held me back

Let me go down he said

No said I my wife is there

Thats the very reason you should not go he said She is safe enough
yet and they would fire only at a man It would be a bad job for her if
you were killed Ill go down

So he went down slowly and cautiously his pistol in one hand and his
life in the other as it were

When he reached the bottom of the steps I changed my mind I could not
remain above while the burglar and Euphemia were below so I followed

The boarder was standing in the middle of the diningroom into which
the stairs led I could not see him but I put my hand against him as I
was feeling my way across the floor

I whispered to him

Shall we put our backs together and revolve and fire

No he whispered back not now he may be on a shelf by this time or
under a table Lets look him up

I confess that I was not very anxious to look him up but I followed the
boarder as he slowly made his way toward the kitchen door As we opened
the door we instinctively stopped

The window was open and by the light of the moon that shone in we saw
the rascal standing on a chair leaning out of the window evidently
just ready to escape Fortunately we were unheard

Lets pull him in whispered the boarder

No I whispered in reply We dont want him in Lets hoist him out

All right returned the boarder

We laid our pistols on the floor and softly approached the window
Being barefooted out steps were noiseless

Hoist when I count three breathed the boarder into my ear

We reached the chair Each of us took hold of two of its legs

Onetwothree said the boarder and together we gave a tremendous
lift and shot the wretch out of the window

The tide was high and there was a good deal of water around the boat
We heard a rousing splash outside

Now there was no need of silence

Shall we run on deck and shoot him as he swims I cried

No said the boarder well get the boathook and jab him if he
tries to climb up

We rushed on deck I seized the boathook and looked over the side But
I saw no one

Hes gone to the bottom I exclaimed

He didnt go very far then said the boarder for its not more than
two feet deep there

Just then our attention was attracted by a voice from the shore

Will you please let down the gangplank We looked ashore and there
stood Pomona dripping from every pore

We spoke no words but lowered the gangplank

She came aboard

Good night said the boarder and he went to bed

Pomona said I what have you been doing

I was a lookin at the moon sir when pop the chair bounced and out
I went

You shouldnt do that I said sternly

Some day youll be drowned Take off your wet things and go to bed

Yes smaamsir I mean said she as she went downstairs

When I reached my room I lighted the lamp and found Euphemia still
under the bed

Is it all right she asked

Yes I answered There was no burglar Pomona fell out of the
window

Did you get her a plaster asked Euphemia drowsily

No she did not need one Shes all right now Were you worried about
me dear

No I trusted in you entirely and I think I dozed a little under the
bed

In one minute she was asleep

The boarder and I did not make this matter a subject of conversation
afterward but Euphemia gave the girl a lecture on her careless ways
and made her take several Dovers powders the next day

An important fact in domestic economy was discovered about this time by
Euphemia and myself Perhaps we were not the first to discover it but
we certainly did find it outand this fact was that housekeeping
costs money At the end of every week we counted up our expendituresit
was no trouble at all to count up our receiptsand every week the
result was more unsatisfactory

If we could only get rid of the disagreeable balance that has to
be taken along all the time and which gets bigger and bigger like a
snowball I think we would find the accounts more satisfactory said
Euphemia

This was on a Saturday night We always got our pencils and paper and
money at the end of the week

Yes said I with an attempt to appear facetious and unconcerned but
it would be all well enough if we could take that snowball to the fire
and melt it down

But there never is any fire where there are snowballs said Euphemia

No said I and thats just the trouble

It was on the following Thursday when I came home in the evening that
Euphemia met me with a glowing face It rather surprised me to see her
look so happy for she had been very quiet and preoccupied for the first
part of the week So much so indeed that I had thought of ordering
smaller roasts for a week or two and taking her to a Thomas Concert
with the money saved But this evening she looked as if she did not need
Thomass orchestra

What makes you so bright my dear said I when I had greeted her
Has anything jolly happened

No said she nothing yet but I am going to make a fire to melt
snowballs

Of course I was very anxious to know how she was going to do it but she
would not tell me It was a plan that she intended to keep to herself
until she saw how it worked I did not press her because she had so few
secrets and I did not hear anything about this plan until it had been
carried out

Her scheme was as follows After thinking over our financial condition
and puzzling her brain to find out some way of bettering it she
had come to the conclusion that she would make some money by her own
exertions to help defray our household expenses She never had made any
money but that was no reason why she should not begin It was too bad
that I should have to toil and toil and not make nearly enough money
after all So she would go to work and earn something with her own
hands

She had heard of an establishment in the city where ladies of limited
means or transiently impecunious could in a very quiet and private
way get sewing to do They could thus provide for their needs without
any one but the officers of the institution knowing anything about it

So Euphemia went to this place and she got some work It was not a very
large bundle but it was larger than she had been accustomed to carry
and what was perfectly dreadful it was wrapped up in a newspaper
When Euphemia told me the story she said that this was too much for her
courage She could not go on the cars and perhaps meet people belonging
to our church with a newspaper bundle under her arm

But her genius for expedients saved her from this humiliation She had
to purchase some sewingcotton and some other little things and when
she had bought them she handed her bundle to the woman behind the
counter and asked her if she would not be so good as to have that
wrapped up with the other things It was a good deal to ask she knew
and the woman smiled for the articles she had bought would not make a
package as large as her hand However her request was complied with
and she took away a very decent package with the card of the store
stamped on the outside I suppose that there are not more than half a
dozen people in this country who would refuse Euphemia anything that she
would be willing to ask for

So she took the work home and she labored faithfully at it for about
a week She did not suppose it would take her so long but she was not
used to such very plain sewing and was much afraid that she would not
do it neatly enough Besides this she could only work on it in the
daytimewhen I was awayand was of course interrupted a great
deal by her ordinary household duties and the necessity of a careful
oversight of Pomonas somewhat erratic methods of doing her work

But at last she finished the job and took it into the city She did not
want to spend any more money on the trip than was absolutely necessary
and so was very glad to find that she had a remnant of pocketmoney
sufficient to pay her fare both ways

When she reached the city she walked up to the place where her work was
to be delivered and found it much farther when she went on foot than it
had seemed to her riding in the street cars She handed over her bundle
to the proper person and as it was soon examined and approved she
received her pay therefor

It amounted to sixty cents She had made no bargain but she was a
little astonished However she said nothing but left the place without
asking for any more work In fact she forgot all about it She had an
idea that everything was all wrong and that idea engrossed her mind
entirely There was no mistake about the sum paid for the lady clerk
had referred to the printed table of prices when she calculated the
amount due But something was wrong and at the moment Euphemia could
not tell what it was She left the place and started to walk back to
the ferry But she was so tired and weak and hungryit was now an hour
or two past her regular luncheon timethat she thought she should faint
if she did not go somewhere and get some refreshments

So like a sensible little woman as she was she went into a restaurant
She sat down at a table and a waiter came to her to see what she would
have She was not accustomed to eatinghouses and perhaps this was
the first time that she had ever visited one alone What she wanted
was something simple So she ordered a cup of tea and some rolls and a
piece of chicken The meal was a very good one and Euphemia enjoyed it
When she had finished she went up to the counter to settle Her bill
was sixty cents She paid the money that she had just received and
walked down to the ferryall in a daze she said When she got home she
thought it over and then she cried

After a while she dried her eyes and when I came home she told me all
about it

I give it up she said I dont believe I can help you any

Poor little thing I took her in my arms and comforted her and before
bedtime I had convinced her that she was fully able to help me better
than any one else on earth and that without puzzling her brains about
business or wearing herself out by sewing for pay

So we went on in our old way and by keeping our attention on our weekly
balance we prevented it from growing very rapidly

We fell back on our philosophy it was all the capital we had and
became as calm and contented as circumstances allowed



CHAPTER V POMONA PRODUCES A PARTIAL REVOLUTION IN RUDDER GRANGE


Euphemia began to take a great deal of comfort in her girl Every
evening she had some new instance to relate of Pomonas inventive
abilities and aptness in adapting herself to the peculiarities of our
method of housekeeping

Only to think said she one afternoon Pomona has just done another
VERY smart thing You know what a trouble it has always been for us
to carry all our waste water upstairs and throw it over the bulwarks
Well she has remedied all that She has cut a nice little low window
in the side of the kitchen and has made a shutter of the piece she cut
out with leather hinges to it and now she can just open this window
throw the water out shut it again and there it is I tell you shes
smart

Yes there is no doubt of that I said but I think that there is
danger of her taking more interest in such extraordinary and novel
duties than in the regular work of the house

Now dont discourage the girl my dear she said for she is of the
greatest use to me and I dont want you to be throwing cold water about
like some people

Not even if I throw it out of Pomonas little door I suppose

No Dont throw it at all Encourage people What would the world be
if everybody chilled our aspirations and extraordinary efforts Like
Fultons steamboat

All right I said Ill not discourage her

It was now getting late in the season It was quite too cool to sit out
on deck in the evening and our garden began to look desolate

Our boarder had wheeled up a lot of fresh earth and had prepared a
large bed in which he had planted turnips They made an excellent fall
crop he assured us

From being simply cool it began to be rainy and the weather grew
decidedly unpleasant But our boarder bade us take courage This was
probably the equinoctial and when it was over there would be a
delightful Indian summer and the turnips would grow nicely

This sounded very well but the wind blew up cold at night and there
was a great deal of unpleasant rain

One night it blew what Pomona called a whirlicane and we went to
bed very early to keep warm We heard our boarder on deck in the garden
after we were in bed and Euphemia said she could not imagine what he
was about unless he was anchoring his turnips to keep them from blowing
away

During the night I had a dream I thought I was a boy again and was
trying to stand upon my head a feat for which I had been famous But
instead of throwing myself forward on my hands and then raising my
heels backward over my head in the orthodox manner I was on my back
and trying to get on my head from that position I awoke suddenly and
found that the footboard of the bedstead was much higher than our heads
We were lying on a very much inclined plane with our heads downward
I roused Euphemia and we both got out of bed when at almost the same
moment we slipped down the floor into ever so much water

Euphemia was scarcely awake and she fell down gurgling It was dark
but I heard her fall and I jumped over the bedstead to her assistance
I had scarcely raised her up when I heard a pounding at the front door
or mainhatchway and our boarder shouted

Get up Come out of that Open the door The old boats turning over

My heart fell within me but I clutched Euphemia I said no word and
she simply screamed I dragged her over the floor sometimes in the
water and sometimes out of it I got the diningroom door open and set
her on the stairs They were in a topsyturvy condition but they were
dry I found a lantern which hung on a nail with a matchbox under
it and I struck a light Then I scrambled back and brought her some
clothes

All this time the boarder was yelling and pounding at the door When
Euphemia was ready I opened the door and took her out

You go dress yourself said the boarder Ill hold her here until you
come back

I left her and found my clothes which chair and all had tumbled
against the foot of the bed and so had not gone into the water and
soon reappeared on deck The wind was blowing strongly but it did not
now seem to be very cold The deck reminded me of the gangplank of a
Harlem steamboat at low tide It was inclined at an angle of more than
fortyfive degrees I am sure There was light enough for us to see
about us but the scene and all the dreadful circumstances made me feel
the most intense desire to wake up and find it all a dream There was no
doubt however about the boarder being wide awake

Now then said he take hold of her on that side and well help her
over here You scramble down on that side its all dry just there The
boats turned over toward the water and Ill lower her down to you
Ill let a rope over the sides You can hold on to that as you go down

I got over the bulwarks and let myself down to the ground Then the
boarder got Euphemia up and slipped her over the side holding to her
hands and letting her gently down until I could reach her She said
never a word but screamed at times I carried her a little way up the
shore and set her down I wanted to take her up to a house near by
where we bought our milk but she declined to go until we had saved
Pomona

So I went back to the boat having carefully wrapped up Euphemia to
endeavor to save the girl I found that the boarder had so arranged
the gangplank that it was possible without a very great exercise of
agility to pass from the shore to the boat When I first saw him
on reaching the shelving deck he was staggering up the stairs with a
diningroom chair and a large framed engraving of Raphaels Dantean
ugly picture but full of true feeling at least so Euphemia always
declared though I am not quite sure that I know what she meant

Where is Pomona I said endeavoring to stand on the hillside of the
deck

I dont know said he but we must get the things out The tides
rising and the winds getting up The boat will go over before we know
it

But we must find the girl I said She cant be left to drown

I dont think it would matter much said he getting over the side
of the boat with his awkward load She would be of about as much use
drowned as any other way If it hadnt been for that hole she cut in the
side of the boat this would never have happened

You dont think it was that I said holding the picture and the chair
while he let himself down to the gangplank

Yes it was he replied The tides very high and the water got over
that hole and rushed in The water and the wind will finish this old
craft before very long

And then he took his load from me and dashed down the gangplank I went
below to look for Pomona The lantern still hung on the nail and I took
it down and went into the kitchen There was Pomona dressed and with
her hat on quietly packing some things in a basket

Come hurry out of this I cried Dont you know that this
housethis boat I mean is a wreck

Yes smaamsir I meanI know it and I suppose we shall soon be at
the mercy of the waves

Well then go as quickly as you can What are you putting in that
basket

Food she said We may need it

I took her by the shoulder and hurried her on deck over the bulwark
down the gangplank and so on to the place where I had left Euphemia

I found the dear girl there quiet and collected all up in a little
bunch to shield herself from the wind I wasted no time but hurried
the two women over to the house of our milkmerchant There with some
difficulty I roused the good woman and after seeing Euphemia and
Pomona safely in the house I left them to tell the tale and ran back
to the boat

The boarder was working like a Trojan He had already a pile of our
furniture on the beach

I set about helping him and for an hour we labored at this hasty and
toilsome moving It was indeed a toilsome business The floors were
shelving the stairs leaned over sideways ever so far and the
gangplank was desperately short and steep

Still we saved quite a number of household articles Some things we
broke and some we forgot and some things were too big to move in this
way but we did very well considering the circumstances

The wind roared the tide rose and the boat groaned and creaked We
were in the kitchen trying to take the stove apart the boarder was
sure we could carry it up if we could get the pipe out and the legs and
doors off when we heard a crash We rushed on deck and found that
the garden had fallen in Making our way as well as we could toward the
gaping rent in the deck we saw that the turnipbed had gone down bodily
into the boarders room He did not hesitate but scrambled down his
narrow stairs I followed him He struck a match that he had in his
pocket and lighted a little lantern that hung under the stairs His
room was a perfect rubbish heap The floor bed chairs pitcher
basineverything was covered or filled with garden mold and turnips
Never did I behold such a scene He stood in the midst of it holding
his lantern high above his head At length he spoke

If we had time he said we might come down here and pick out a lot
of turnips

But how about your furniture I exclaimed

Oh thats ruined he replied

So we did not attempt to save any of it but we got hold of his trunk
and carried that on shore

When we returned we found that the water was pouring through his
partition making the room a lake of mud And as the water was rising
rapidly below and the boat was keeling over more and more we thought
it was time to leave and we left

It would not do to go far away from our possessions which were piled up
in a sadlooking heap on the shore and so after I had gone over to the
milkwomans to assure Euphemia of our safety the boarder and I passed
the rest of the nightthere was not much of it leftin walking up
and down the beach smoking some cigars which he fortunately had in his
pocket

In the morning I took Euphemia to the hotel about a mile awayand
arranged for the storage of our furniture there until we could find
another habitation This habitation we determined was to be in a
substantial house or part of a house which should not be affected by
the tides

During the morning the removal of our effects was successfully
accomplished and our boarder went to town to look for a furnished room
He had nothing but his trunk to take to it

In the afternoon I left Euphemia at the hotel where she was taking a
nap she certainly needed it for she had spent the night in a wooden
rockingchair at the milkwomans and I strolled down to the river to
take a last look at the remains of old Rudder Grange

I felt sadly enough as I walked along the wellworn path to the
canalboat and thought how it had been worn by my feet more than any
others and how gladly I had walked that way so often during that
delightful summer I forgot all that had been disagreeable and thought
only of the happy times we had had

It was a beautiful autumn afternoon and the wind had entirely died
away When I came within sight of our old home it presented a doleful
appearance The bow had drifted out into the river and was almost
entirely under water The stern stuck up in a mournful and ridiculous
manner with its keel instead of its broadside presented to the view
of persons on the shore As I neared the boat I heard a voice I stopped
and listened There was no one in sight Could the sounds come from the
boat I concluded that it must be so and I walked up closer Then I
heard distinctly the words

He grasp ed her by the thro at and yell ed swear to me thou nev er
wilt re veal my se cret or thy hot hearts blood shall stain this mar
bel fib or she gave one gry vy ous gasp and

It was Pomona

Doubtless she had climbed up the stern of the boat and had descended
into the depths of the wreck to rescue her beloved book the reading of
which had so long been interrupted by my harsh decrees Could I break
in on this one hour of rapture I had not the heart to do it and as
I slowly moved away there came to me the last words that I ever heard
from Rudder Grange

And with one wild shry ik to heav en her hearts blo od spat ter ed
that prynce ly home of woe



CHAPTER VI THE NEW RUDDER GRANGE


I have before given an account of the difficulties we encountered when
we started out househunting and it was this doleful experience which
made Euphemia declare that before we set out on a second search for a
residence we should know exactly what we wanted

To do this we must know how other people live we must examine into the
advantages and disadvantages of the various methods of housekeeping and
make up our minds on the subject

When we came to this conclusion we were in a city boardinghouse and
were entirely satisfied that this style of living did not suit us at
all

At this juncture I received a letter from the gentleman who had boarded
with us on the canalboat Shortly after leaving us the previous fall
he had married a widow lady with two children and was now keeping house
in a French flat in the upper part of the city We had called upon the
happy couple soon after their marriage and the letter now received
contained an invitation for us to come and dine and spend the night

Well go said Euphemia Theres nothing I want so much as to see how
people keep house in a French flat Perhaps well like it And I must
see those children So we went

The house as Euphemia remarked was anything but flat It was very tall
indeedthe tallest house in the neighborhood We entered the vestibule
the outer door being open and beheld on one side of us a row
of bellhandles Above each of these handles was the mouth of a
speakingtube and above each of these a little glazed frame containing
a visitingcard

Isnt this cute said Euphemia reading over the cards Heres his
name and this is his bell and tube Which would you do first ring or
blow

My dear said I you dont blow up those tubes We must ring the
bell just as if it were an ordinary frontdoor bell and instead of
coming to the door some one will call down the tube to us

I rang the bell under the boarders name and very soon a voice at the
tube said

Well

Then I told our names and in an instant the front door opened

Why their flat must be right here whispered Euphemia How quickly
the girl came

And she looked for the girl as we entered But there was no one there

Their flat is on the fifth story said I He mentioned that in his
letter We had better shut the door and go up

Up and up the softly carpeted stairs we climbed and not a soul we saw
or heard

It is like an enchanted cavern said Euphemia You say the magic
word the door in the rock opens and you go on and on through the
vaulted passages

Until you come to the ogre said the boarder who was standing at the
top of the stairs He did not behave at all like an ogre for he was
very glad to see us and so was his wife After we had settled down
in the parlor and the boarders wife had gone to see about something
concerning the dinner Euphemia asked after the children

I hope they havent gone to bed she said for I do so want to see
the dear little things

The exboarder as Euphemia called him smiled grimly

Theyre not so very little he said My wifes son is nearly grown
He is at an academy in Connecticut and he expects to go into a civil
engineers office in the spring His sister is older than he is My wife
marriedin the first instancewhen she was very youngvery young in
deed

Oh said Euphemia and then after a pause And neither of them is at
home now

No said the exboarder By the way what do you think of this dado
It is a portable one I devised it myself You can take it away with you
to another house when you move But there is the dinnerbell Ill show
you over the establishment after we have had something to eat

After our meal we made a tour of inspection The flat which included
the whole floor contained nine or ten rooms of all shapes and sizes
The corners in some of the rooms were cut off and shaped up into closets
and recesses so that Euphemia said the corners of every room were in
some other room

Near the back of the flat was a dumbwaiter with bells and
speakingtubes When the butcher the baker or the kerosenelamp maker
came each morning he rang the bell and called up the tube to know what
was wanted The order was called down and he brought the things in the
afternoon

All this greatly charmed Euphemia It was so cute so complete There
were no interviews with disagreeable tradespeople none of the ordinary
annoyances of housekeeping Everything seemed to be done with a bell a
speakingtube or a crank

Indeed said the exboarder if it were not for people tripping
over the wires I could rig up attachments by which I could sit in the
parlor and by using pedals and a keyboard I could do all the work of
this house without getting out of my easychair

One of the most peculiar features of the establishment was the servants
room This was at the rear end of the floor and as there was not much
space left after the other rooms had been made it was very small so
small indeed that it would accommodate only a very short bedstead
This made it necessary for our friends to consider the size of the
servant when they engaged her

There were several excellent girls at the intelligence office where I
called said the exboarder but I measured them and they were all
too tall So we had to take a short one who is only so so There was
one big Scotch girl who was the very person for us and I would have
taken her if my wife had not objected to my plan for her accommodation

What was that I asked

Well said he I first thought of cutting a hole in the partition
wall at the foot of the bed for her to put her feet through

Never said his wife emphatically I would never have allowed that

And then continued he I thought of turning the bed around and
cutting a larger hole through which she might have put her head into
the little room on this side A low table could have stood under the
hole and her head might have rested on a cushion on the table very
comfortably

My dear said his wife it would have frightened me to death to go
into that room and see that head on a cushion on a table

Like John the Baptist interrupted Euphemia

Well said our exboarder the plan would have had its advantages

Oh cried Euphemia looking out of a back window What a lovely
little iron balcony Do you sit out there on warm evenings

Thats a fireescape said the exboarder We dont go out there
unless it is very hot indeed on account of the house being on fire
You see there is a little door in the floor of the balcony and an iron
ladder leading to the balcony beneath and so on down to the first
story

And you have to creep through that hole and go down that dreadful steep
ladder every time there is a fire said Euphemia

Well I guess we would never go down but once he answered

No indeed said Euphemia youd fall down and break your neck the
first time and she turned away from the window with a very grave
expression on her face

Soon after this our hostess conducted Euphemia to the guestchamber
while her husband and I finished a bedtime cigar

When I joined Euphemia in her room she met me with a mysterious
expression on her face She shut the door and then said in a very
earnest tone

Do you see that little bedstead in the corner I did not notice it
until I came in just now and then being quite astonished I said
Why heres a childs bed who sleeps here Oh says she thats
our little Adeles bedstead We have it in our room when shes here
Little Adele said I I didnt know she was littlenot small enough
for that bed at any rate Why yes said she Adele is only four
years old The bedstead is quite large enough for her And she is not
here now I said utterly amazed at all this No she answered she
is not here now but we try to have her with us as much as we can and
always keep her little bed ready for her I suppose shes with her
fathers people I said and she answered Oh yes and bade me
goodnight What does all this mean Our boarder told us that the
daughter is grown up and here his wife declares that she is only four
years old I dont know what in the world to make of this mystery

I could give Euphemia no clue I supposed there was some mistake and
that was all I could say except that I was sleepy and that we could
find out all about it in the morning But Euphemia could not dismiss the
subject from her mind She said no morebut I could seeuntil I fell
asleepthat she was thinking about it

It must have been about the middle of the night perhaps later when
I was suddenly awakened by Euphemia starting up in the bed with the
exclamation

I have it

What I cried sitting up in a great hurry What is it What have you
got Whats the matter

I know it she said I know it Our boarder is a GRANDFATHER Little
Adele is the grownup daughters child He was quite particular to say
that his wife married VERY young Just to think of it So short a time
ago he was living with usa bachelorand now in four short months
he is a grandfather

Carefully propounded inquiries in the morning proved Euphemias
conclusions to be correct

The next evening when we were quietly sitting in our own room Euphemia
remarked that she did not wish to have anything to do with French flats

They seem to be very convenient I said

Oh yes convenient enough but I dont like them I would hate to live
where everything let down like a tablelid or else turned with a crank
And when I think of those fireescapes and the boarders grandchild it
makes me feel very unpleasantly

But the grandchild dont follow as a matter of course said I

No she answered but I shall never like French flats

And we discussed them no more

For some weeks we examined into every style of economic and respectable
housekeeping and many methods of living in what Euphemia called
imitation comfort were set aside as unworthy of consideration

My dear said Euphemia one evening what we really ought to do is to
build Then we would have exactly the house we want

Very true I replied but to build a house a man must have money

Oh no said she or at least not much For one thing you might join
a building association In some of those societies I know that you only
have to pay a dollar a week

But do you suppose the association builds houses for all its members
I asked

Of course I suppose so Else why is it called a building association

I had read a good deal about these organizations and I explained to
Euphemia that a dollar a week was never received by any of them in
payment for a new house

Then build yourself she said I know how that can be done

Oh its easy enough I remarked if you have the money

No you neednt have any money said Euphemia rather hastily Just
let me show you Supposing for instance that you want to build a house
worthwell say twenty thousand dollars in some pretty town near the
city

I would rather figure on a cheaper house than that for a country
place I interrupted

Well then say two thousand dollars You get masons and carpenters
and people to dig the cellar and you engage them to build your house
You neednt pay them until its done of course Then when its all
finished borrow two thousand dollars and give the house as security
After that you see you have only to pay the interest on the borrowed
money When you save enough money to pay back the loan the house is
your own Now isnt that a good plan

Yes said I if there could be found people who would build your
house and wait for their money until some one would lend you its full
value on a mortgage

Well said Euphemia I guess they could be found if you would only
look for them

Ill look for them when I go to heaven I said

We gave up for the present the idea of building or buying a house and
determined to rent a small place in the country and then as Euphemia
wisely said if we liked it we might buy it After she had dropped her
building projects she thought that one ought to know just how a house
would suit before having it on ones hands

We could afford something better than a canalboat now and therefore we
were not so restricted as in our first search for a house But the
one thing which troubled my wifeand indeed caused me much anxious
thought was that scourge of almost all rural localitiestramps It
would be necessary for me to be away all dayand we could not afford
to keep a manso we must be careful to get a house somewhere off the
line of ordinary travel or else in a wellsettled neighborhood where
there would be some one near at hand in case of unruly visitors

A village I dont like said Euphemia there is always so much
gossip and people know all about what you have and what you do And
yet it would be very lonely and perhaps dangerous for us to live
off somewhere all by ourselves And there is another objection to a
village We dont want a house with a small yard and a garden at the
back We ought to have a dear little farm with some fields for corn
and a cow and a barn and things of that sort All that would be
lovely Ill tell you what we want she cried seized with a sudden
inspiration we ought to try to get the endhouse of a village Then
our house could be near the neighbors and our farm could stretch out a
little way into the country beyond us Let us fix our minds upon such a
house and I believe we can get it

So we fixed our minds but in the course of a week or two we unfixed
them several times to allow the consideration of places which otherwise
would have been out of range and during one of these intervals of
mental disfixment we took a house

It was not the endhouse of a village but it was in the outskirts of
a very small rural settlement Our nearest neighbor was within vigorous
shouting distance and the house suited us so well in other respects
that we concluded that this would do The house was small but large
enough There were some trees around it and a little lawn in front
There was a garden a small barn and stable a pasture field and land
enough besides for small patches of corn and potatoes The rent was low
the water good and no one can imagine how delighted we were

We did not furnish the whole house at first but what mattered it We
had no horse or cow but the pasture and barn were ready for them We
did not propose to begin with everything at once

Our first evening in that house was made up of hours of unalloyed bliss
We walked from room to room we looked out on the garden and the lawn
we sat on the little porch while I smoked

We were happy at Rudder Grange said Euphemia but that was only
a canalboat and could not in the nature of things have been a
permanent home

No said I it could not have been permanent But in many respects
it was a delightful home The very name of it brings pleasant thoughts

It was a nice name said Euphemia and Ill tell you what we might
do Let us call this place Rudder Grangethe New Rudder Grange The
name will do just as well for a house as for a boat

I agreed on the spot and the house was christened

Our household was small we had a servanta German woman and we had
ourselves that was all

I did not do much in the garden it was too late in the season The
former occupant had planted some corn and potatoes with a few other
vegetables and these I weeded and hoed working early in the morning
and when I came home in the afternoon Euphemia tied up the rosevines
trimmed the bushes and with a little rake and hoe she prepared a
flowerbed in front of the parlorwindow This exercise gave us splendid
appetites and we loved our new home more and more

Our German girl did not suit us exactly at first and day by day she
grew to suit us less She was a quiet kindly pleasant creature and
delighted in an outofdoor life She was as willing to weed in the
garden as she was to cook or wash At first I was very much pleased with
this because as I remarked to Euphemia you can find very few girls
who would be willing to work in the garden and she might be made very
useful

But after a time Euphemia began to get a little out of patience with
her She worked outofdoors entirely too much And what she did there
as well as some of her work in the house was very much like certain
German literatureyou did not know how it was done or what it was for

One afternoon I found Euphemia quite annoyed

Look here she said and see what that girl has been at work at
nearly all this afternoon I was upstairs sewing and thought she was
ironing Isnt it too provoking

It WAS provoking The contemplative German had collected a lot of short
hamboneswhere she found them I cannot imagineand had made of them
a border around my wifes flowerbed The bones stuck up straight a few
inches above the ground all along the edge of the bed and the marrow
cavity of each one was filled with earth in which she had planted seeds

These she says will spring up and look beautiful said Euphemia
they have that style of thing in her country

Then let her take them off with her to her country I exclaimed

No no said Euphemia hurriedly dont kick them out It would only
wound her feelings She did it all for the best and thought it
would please me to have such a border around my bed But she is too
independent and neglects her proper work I will give her a weeks
notice and get another servant When she goes we can take these horrid
bones away But I hope nobody will call on us in the meantime

Must we keep these things here a whole week I asked

Oh I cant turn her away without giving her a fair notice That would
be cruel

I saw the truth of the remark and determined to bear with the bones and
her rather than be unkind

That night Euphemia informed the girl of her decision and the next
morning soon after I had left the good German appeared with her bonnet
on and her carpetbag in her hand to take leave of her mistress

What cried Euphemia You are not going today

If it is goot to go at all it is goot to go now said the girl

And you will go off and leave me without any one in the house after my
putting myself out to give you a fair notice Its shameful

I think it is very goot for me to go now quietly replied the girl
This house is very loneful I will go tomorrow in the city to see your
husband for my money Goot morning And off she trudged to the station

Before I reached the house that afternoon Euphemia rushed out to tell
this story I would not like to say how far I kicked those hambones

This German girl had several successors and some of them suited as
badly and left as abruptly as herself but Euphemia never forgot the
ungrateful stab given her by this hambone girl as she always
called her It was her first wound of the kind and it came in the
very beginning of the campaign when she was all unused to this domestic
warfare



CHAPTER VII TREATING OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL BROKER AND A DOG


It was a couple of weeks or thereabouts after this episode that
Euphemia came down to the gate to meet me on my return from the city
I noticed a very peculiar expression on her face She looked both
thoughtful and pleased Almost the first words she said to me were
these

A tramp came here today

I am sorry to hear that I exclaimed Thats the worst news I have
had yet I did hope that we were far enough from the line of travel to
escape these scourges How did you get rid of him Was he impertinent

You must not feel that way about all tramps said she Sometimes they
are deserving of our charity and ought to be helped There is a great
difference in them

That may be I said but what of this one When was he here and when
did he go

He did not go at all He is here now

Here now I cried Where is he

Do not call out so loud said Euphemia putting her hand on my arm
You will waken him He is asleep

Asleep said I A tramp Here

Yes Stop let me tell you about him He told me his story and it is
a sad one He is a middleaged manfifty perhapsand has been rich
He was once a broker in Wall street but lost money by the failure of
various railroadsthe Camden and Amboy for one

That hasnt failed I interrupted

Well then it was the Northern Pacific or some other one of themat
any rate I know it was either a railroad or a bankand he soon became
very poor He has a son in Cincinnati who is a successful merchant and
lives in a fine house with horses and carriages and all that and this
poor man has written to his son but has never had any answer So now
he is going to walk to Cincinnati to see him He knows he will not be
turned away if he can once meet his son face to face He was very tired
when he stopped hereand he has ever and ever so far to walk yet you
knowand so after I had given him something to eat I let him lie down
in the outer kitchen on that roll of ragcarpet that is there I spread
it out for him It is a hard bed for one who has known comfort but he
seems to sleep soundly

Let me see him said I and I walked back to the outer kitchen

There lay the unsuccessful broker fast asleep His face which was
turned toward me as I entered showed that it had been many days since
he had been shaved and his hair had apparently been uncombed for about
the same length of time His clothes were very old and a good deal
torn and he wore one boot and one shoe

Whew said I Have you been giving him whisky

No whispered Euphemia of course not I noticed that smell and he
said he had been cleaning his clothes with alcohol

They needed it Im sure I remarked as I turned away And now said
I wheres the girl

This is her afternoon out What is the matter You look frightened

Oh Im not frightened but I find I must go down to the station again
Just run up and put on your bonnet It will be a nice little walk for
you

I had been rapidly revolving the matter in my mind What was I to do
with this wretch who was now asleep in my outer kitchen If I woke him
up and drove him offand I might have difficulty in doing itthere
was every reason to believe that he would not go far but return
at night and commit some revengeful act I never saw a more
sinisterlooking fellow And he was certainly drunk He must not be
allowed to wander about our neighborhood I would go for the constable
and have him arrested

So I locked the door from the kitchen into the house and then the
outside door of the kitchen and when my wife came down we hurried off
On the way I told her what I intended to do and what I thought of
our guest She answered scarcely a word and I hoped that she was
frightened I think she was

The constable who was also coroner of our township had gone to a
creek three miles away to hold an inquest and there was nobody to
arrest the man The nearest policestation was at Hackingford six miles
away on the railroad I held a consultation with the stationmaster
and the gentleman who kept the grocerystore opposite

They could think of nothing to be done except to shoot the man and to
that I objected

However said I he cant stay there and a happy thought just then
striking me I called to the boy who drove the village expresswagon
and engaged him for a job The wagon was standing at the station and to
save time I got in and rode to my house Euphemia went over to call on
the grocerymans wife until I returned

I had determined that the man should be taken away although until I
was riding home I had not made up my mind where to have him taken But
on the road I settled this matter

On reaching the house we drove into the yard as close to the kitchen
as we could go Then I unlocked the door and the boywho was a big
strapping fellowentered with me We found the exbroker still wrapped
in the soundest slumber Leaving the boy to watch him I went upstairs
and got a baggagetag which I directed to the chief of police at the
police station in Hackingford I returned to the kitchen and fastened
this tag conspicuously on the lapel of the sleepers coat Then with
a clothesline I tied him up carefully hand and foot To all this he
offered not the slightest opposition When he was suitably packed with
due regard to the probable tenderness of wrist and ankle in one brought
up in luxury the boy and I carried him to the wagon

He was a heavy load and we may have bumped him a little but his sleep
was not disturbed Then we drove him to the express office This was at
the railroad station and the stationmaster was also express agent At
first he was not inclined to receive my parcel but when I assured him
that all sorts of live things were sent by express and that I could see
no reason for making an exception in this case he added my arguments
to his own disposition as a householder to see the goods forwarded to
their destination and so gave me a receipt and pasted a label on the
exbrokers shoulder I set no value on the package which I prepaid

Now then said the stationmaster hell go all right if the express
agent on the train will take him

This matter was soon settled for in a few minutes the train stopped
at the station My package was wheeled to the express car and two
porters who entered heartily into the spirit of the thing hoisted it
into the car The trainagent who just then noticed the character of
the goods began to declare that he would not have the fellow in his
car but my friend the stationmaster shouted out that everything was
all rightthe man was properly packed invoiced and paid for and the
train which was behind time moved away before the irate agent could
take measures to get rid of his unwelcome freight

Now said I therell be a drunken man at the policestation in
Hackingford in about halfanhour His offense will be as evident there
as here and they can do what they please with him I shall telegraph
to explain the matter and prepare them for his arrival

When I had done this Euphemia and I went home The tramp had cost me
some money but I was well satisfied with my evenings work and felt
that the township owed me at least a vote of thanks

But I firmly made up my mind that Euphemia should never again be left
unprotected I would not even trust to a servant who would agree to have
no afternoons out I would get a dog

The next day I advertised for a fierce watchdog and in the course of
a week I got one Before I procured him I examined into the merits
and price of about one hundred dogs My dog was named Pete but I
determined to make a change in that respect He was a very tall bony
powerful beast of a dull black color and with a lower jaw that would
crack the hindleg of an ox so I was informed He was of a varied
breed and the good Irishman of whom I bought him said he had fine blood
in him and attempted to refer him back to the different classes of dogs
from which he had been derived But after I had had him awhile I made
an analysis based on his appearance and character and concluded that he
was mainly bloodhound shaded with wolfdog and mastiff and picked out
with touches of bulldog

The man brought him home for me and chained him up in an unused
woodshed for I had no doghouse as yet

Now thin said he all youve got to do is to keep im chained up
there for three or four days till he gets used to ye An Ill tell ye
the best way to make a dog like ye Jist give him a good lickin Then
hell know yer his master and hell like ye iver aftherward Theres
plenty of people that dont know that And by the way sir that
chains none too strong for im I got it when he wasnt morn half
grown Yed bether git him a new one

When the man had gone I stood and looked at the dog and could not
help hoping that he would learn to like me without the intervention of a
thrashing Such harsh methods were not always necessary I felt sure

After our evening meala combination of dinner and supper of which
Euphemia used to say that she did not know whether to call it dinper or
supnerwe went out together to look at our new guardian

Euphemia was charmed with him

How massive she exclaimed What splendid limbs And look at that
immense head I know I shall never be afraid now I feel that that is a
dog I can rely upon Make him stand up please so I can see how tall he
is

I think it would be better not to disturb him I answered he may
be tired He will get up of his own accord very soon And indeed I
hope that he will not get up until I go to the store and get him a new
chain

As I said this I made a step forward to look at his chain and at that
instant a low growl like the first rumblings of an earthquake ran
through the dog

I stepped back again and walked over to the village for the chain The
dogchains shown me at the store all seemed too short and too weak and
I concluded to buy two chains such as used for hitching horses and to
join them so as to make a long as well as a strong one of them I wanted
him to be able to come out of the woodshed when it should be necessary
to show himself

On my way home with my purchase the thought suddenly struck me How will
you put that chain on your dog The memory of the rumbling growl was
still vivid

I never put the chain on him As I approached him with it in my hand he
rose to his feet his eyes sparkled his black lips drew back from his
mighty teeth he gave one savage bark and sprang at me

His chain held and I went into the house That night he broke loose and
went home to his master who lived fully ten miles away

When I found in the morning that he was gone I was in doubt whether it
would be better to go and look for him or not But I concluded to keep
up a brave heart and found him as I expected at the place where I had
bought him The Irishman took him to my house again and I had to pay for
the mans loss of time as well as for his fare on the railroad But the
dogs old master chained him up with the new chain and I felt repaid for
my outlay

Every morning and night I fed that dog and I spoke as kindly and gently
to him as I knew how But he seemed to cherish a distaste for me and
always greeted me with a growl He was an awful dog

About a week after the arrival of this animal I was astonished and
frightened on nearing the house to hear a scream from my wife I rushed
into the yard and was greeted with a succession of screams from two
voices that seemed to come from the vicinity of the woodshed Hurrying
thither I perceived Euphemia standing on the roof of the shed in
perilous proximity to the edge while near the ridge of the roof sat our
hired girl with her handkerchief over her head

Hurry hurry cried Euphemia Climb up here The dog is loose Be
quick Be quick Oh hes coming hes coming

I asked for no explanation There was a railfence by the side of the
shed and I sprang on this and was on the roof just as the dog came
bounding and barking from the barn

Instantly Euphemia had me in her arms and we came very near going off
the roof together

I never feared to have you come home before she sobbed I thought he
would tear you limb from limb

But how did all this happen said I

Och I kin hardly remember said the girl from under her handkerchief

Well I didnt ask you I said somewhat too sharply

Oh Ill tell you said Euphemia There was a man at the gate and he
looked suspicious and didnt try to come in and Mary was at the barn
looking for an egg and I thought this was a good time to see whether
the dog was a good watchdog or not so I went and unchained him

Did you unchain that dog I cried

Yes and the minute he was loose he made a rush at the gate but the
man was gone before he got there and as he ran down the road I saw that
he was Mr Hendersons man who was coming here on an errand I expect
and then I went down to the barn to get Mary to come and help me chain
up the dog and when she came out he began to chase me and then her
and we were so frightened that we climbed up here and I dont know
Im sure how I ever got up that fence and do you think he can climb up
here

Oh no my dear I said

An hes just the beast to go afther a stipladder said the girl in
muffled tones

And what are we to do asked Euphemia We cant eat and sleep up
here Dont you think that if we were all to shout out together we
could make some neighbor hear

Oh yes I said there is no doubt of it But then if a neighbor
came the dog would fall on him

And tear him limb from limb interrupted Euphemia

Yes and besides my dear I should hate to have any of the neighbors
come and find us all up here It would look so utterly absurd Let me
try and think of some other plan

Well please be as quick as you can Its dreadful to bewhos that

I looked up and saw a female figure just entering the yard

Oh what shall we do exclaimed Euphemia The dog will get her Call
to her

No no said I dont make a noise It will only bring the dog He
seems to have gone to the barn or somewhere Keep perfectly quiet and
she may go up on the porch and as the front door is not locked she may
rush into the house if she sees him coming

I do hope she will do that said Euphemia anxiously

And yet said I its not pleasant to have strangers going into the
house when theres no one there

But its better than seeing a stranger torn to pieces before your
eyes said Euphemia

Yes I replied it is Dont you think we might get down now The dog
isnt here

No no cried Euphemia There he is now coming this way And look at
that woman She is coming right to this shed

Sure enough our visitor had passed by the front door and was walking
toward us Evidently she had heard our voices

Dont come here cried Euphemia Youll be killed Run run The dog
is coming Why mercy on us Its Pomona



CHAPTER VIII POMONA ONCE MORE


Sure enough it was Pomona There stood our old servantgirl of the
canalboat with a crooked straw bonnet on her head a faded yellow
parasol in her hand a parcel done up in newspaper under her arm and an
expression of astonishment on her face

Well truly she ejaculated

Into the house quick I said We have a savage dog

And here he is cried Euphemia Oh she will be torn to atoms

Straight at Pomona came the great black beast barking furiously But
the girl did not move she did not even turn her head to look at the
dog who stopped before he reached her and began to rush wildly around
her barking terribly

We held our breath I tried to say get out or lie down but my
tongue could not form the words

Cant you get up here gasped Euphemia

I dont want to said the girl

The dog now stopped barking and stood looking at Pomona occasionally
glancing up at us Pomona took not the slightest notice of him

Do you know maam said she to Euphemia that if I had come here
yesterday that dog would have had my lifes blood

And why dont he have it today said Euphemia who with myself was
utterly amazed at the behavior of the dog

Because I know more today than I did yesterday answered Pomona It
is only this afternoon that I read something as I was coming here on
the cars This is it she continued unwrapping her paper parcel and
taking from it one of the two books it contained I finished this part
just as the cars stopped and I put my scissors in the place Ill read
it to you

Standing there with one book still under her arm the newspaper half
unwrapped from it hanging down and flapping in the breeze she opened
the other volume at the scissorsplace turned back a page or two and
began to read as follows


Lord Edward slowly santered up the broad ancestral walk when
suddenly from out a copse there sprang a furious hound The
marshman concealed in a tree expected to see the lifes blood of
the young nobleman stain the path But no Lord Edward did not stop
nor turn his head With a smile he strode steadily on Well he knew
that if by betraying no emotion he could show the dog that he was
walking where he had a right the brute would recognize that right
and let him pass unscathed Thus in this moment of peril his noble
courage saved him The hound abashed returned to his covert and Lord
Edward passed on

Foiled again muttered the marshman


Now then said Pomona closing the book you see I remembered
that the minute I saw the dog coming and I didnt betray any emotion
Yesterday now when I didnt know it Id a been sure to betray
emotion and he would have had my lifes blood Did he drive you up
there

Yes said Euphemia and she hastily explained the situation

Then I guess Id better chain him up remarked Pomona and advancing
to the dog she took him boldly by the collar and pulled him toward the
shed The animal hung back at first but soon followed her and she
chained him up securely

Now you can come down said Pomona

I assisted Euphemia to the ground and Pomona persuaded the hired girl
to descend

Will he grab me by the leg asked the girl

No get down gump said Pomona and down she scrambled

We took Pomona into the house with us and asked her news of herself

Well said she there aint much to tell I staid awhile at the
institution but I didnt get much good there only I learned to read
to myself because if I read out loud they came and took the book away
Then I left there and went to live out but the woman was awful mean
She throwed away one of my books and I was only half through it It was
a real good book named The Bridal Corpse or Montregors Curse and
I had to pay for it at the circulatin library So I left her quick
enough and then I went on the stage

On the stage cried Euphemia What did you do on the stage

Scrub replied Pomona You see that I thought if I could get anything
to do at the theayter I could work my way up so I was glad to get
scrubbin I asked the prompter one morning if he thought there was a
chance for me to work up and he said yes I might scrub the galleries
and then I told him that I didnt want none of his lip and I pretty
soon left that place I heard you was akeepin house out here and so I
thought Id come along and see you and if you hadnt no girl Id like
to live with you again and I guess you might as well take me for that
other girl said when she got down from the shed that she was goin
away tomorrow she wouldnt stay in no house where they kept such a
dog though I told her I guessed he was only cuttin round because he
was so glad to get loose

Cutting around exclaimed Euphemia It was nothing of the kind If
you had seen him you would have known better But did you come now to
stay Where are your things

On me replied Pomona

When Euphemia found that the Irish girl really intended to leave we
consulted together and concluded to engage Pomona and I went so far as
to agree to carry her books to and from the circulating library to which
she subscribed hoping thereby to be able to exercise some influence
on her taste And thus part of the old family of Rudder Grange had come
together again True the boarder was away but as Pomona remarked
when she heard about him You couldnt always expect to ever regain the
ties that had always bound everybody

Our delight and interest in our little farm increased day by day In
a week or two after Pomonas arrival I bought a cow Euphemia was
very anxious to have an Alderneythey were such gentle beautiful
creaturesbut I could not afford such a luxury I might possibly
compass an Alderney calf but we would have to wait a couple of years
for our milk and Euphemia said it would be better to have a common cow
than to do that

Great was our inward satisfaction when the cow our OWN cow walked
slowly and solemnly into our yard and began to crop the clover on our
little lawn Pomona and I gently drove her to the barn while Euphemia
endeavored to quiet the violent demonstrations of the dog fortunately
chained by assuring him that this was OUR cow and that she was to live
here and that he was to take care of her and never bark at her All
this and much more delivered in the earnest and confidential tone in
which ladies talk to infants and dumb animals made the dog think that
he was to be let loose to kill the cow and he bounded and leaped with
delight tugging at his chain so violently that Euphemia became a little
frightened and left him This dog had been named Lord Edward at the
earnest solicitation of Pomona and he was becoming somewhat reconciled
to his life with us He allowed me to unchain him at night and I could
generally chain him up in the morning without trouble if I had a good
big plate of food with which to tempt him into the shed

Before supper we all went down to the barn to see the milking Pomona
who knew all about such things having been on a farm in her first
youth was to be the milkmaid But when she began operations she did no
more than begin Milk as industriously as she might she got no milk

This is a queer cow said Pomona

Are you sure that you know how to milk asked Euphemia anxiously

Can I milk said Pomona Why of course maam Ive seen em milk
hundreds of times

But you never milked yourself I remarked

No sir but I know just how its done

That might be but she couldnt do it and at last we had to give up the
matter in despair and leave the poor cow until morning when Pomona was
to go for a man who occasionally worked on the place and engage him to
come and milk for us

That night as we were going to bed I looked out of the window at the
barn which contained the cow and was astonished to see that there was a
light inside of the building

What I exclaimed Cant we be left in peaceful possession of a cow
for a single night And taking my revolver I hurried downstairs and
outofdoors forgetting my hat in my haste Euphemia screamed after me
to be careful and keep the pistol pointed away from me

I whistled for the dog as I went out but to my surprise he did not
answer

Has he been killed I thought and for a moment I wished that I was
a large family of brothersall armed

But on my way to the barn I met a person approaching with a lantern and
a dog It was Pomona and she had a milkpail on her arm

See here sir she said its morn half full I just made up my mind
that Id learn to milkif it took me all night I didnt go to bed at
all and Ive been at the barn fur an hour And there aint no need of
my goin after no man in the mornin said she hanging up the barn key
on its nail

I simply mention this circumstance to show what kind of a girl Pomona
had grown to be

We were all the time at work in some way improving our little place
Some day we will buy it said Euphemia We intended to have some wheat
put in in the fall and next year we would make the place fairly crack
with luxuriance We would divide the duties of the farm and among
other things Euphemia would take charge of the chickens She wished to
do this entirely herself so that there might be one thing that should
be all her own just as my work in town was all my own As she wished
to buy the chickens and defray all the necessary expenses out of her own
private funds I could make no objections and indeed I had no desire
to do so She bought a chickenbook and made herself mistress of
the subject For a week there was a strong chicken flavor in all our
conversation

This was while the poultry yard was building There was a chickenhouse
on the place but no yard and Euphemia intended to have a good big one
because she was going into the business to make money

Perhaps my chickens may buy the place she said and I very much hoped
they would

Everything was to be done very systematically She would have Leghorns
Brahmas and common fowls The first because they laid so many eggs
the second because they were such fine big fowls and the third
because they were such good mothers

We will eat and sell the eggs of the first and third classes she
said and set the eggs of the second class under the hens of the third
class

There seems to be some injustice in that arrangement I said for the
first class will always be childless the second class will have nothing
to do with their offspring while the third will be obliged to bring up
and care for the children of others

But I really had no voice in this matter As soon as the carpenter
had finished the yard and had made some coops and other necessary
arrangements Euphemia hired a carriage and went about the country to
buy chickens It was not easy to find just what she wanted and she was
gone all day

However she brought home an enormous Brahma cock and ten hens which
number was pretty equally divided into her three classes She was very
proud of her purchases and indeed they were fine fowls In the
evening I made some allusion to the cost of all this carpenter work
carriagehire etc besides the price of the chickens

O said she you dont look at the matter in the right light You
havent studied it up as I have Now just let me show you how this
thing will pay if carried on properly Producing a piece of paper
covered with figures she continued I begin with ten hensI got
four common ones because it would make it easier to calculate After a
while I set these ten hens on thirteen eggs each three of these eggs
will probably spoilthat leaves ten chickens hatched out Of these I
will say that half die that will make five chickens for each hen you
see I leave a large margin for loss This makes fifty chickens and
when we add the ten hens we have sixty fowls at the end of the first
year Next year I set these sixty and they bring up five chickens
eachI am sure there will be a larger proportion than this but I want
to be safeand that is three hundred chickens add the hens and we
have three hundred and sixty at the end of the second year In the third
year calculating in the same safe way we shall have twentyone hundred
and sixty chickens in the fourth year there will be twelve thousand
nine hundred and sixty and at the end of the fifth year which is as
far as I need to calculate now we shall have sixtyfour thousand and
eight hundred chickens What do you think of that At seventyfive cents
apiecea very low pricethat would be fortyeight thousand and
six hundred dollars Now what is the petty cost of a fence and a few
coops by the side of a sum like that

Nothing at all I answered It is lost like a drop in the ocean I
hate my dear to interfere in any way with such a splendid calculation
as that but I would like to ask you one question

Oh of course she said I suppose you are going to say something
about the cost of feeding all this poultry That is to come out of the
chickens supposed to die They wont die It is ridiculous to suppose
that each hen will bring up but five chickens The chickens that will
live out of those I consider as dead will more than pay for the feed

That is not what I was going to ask you although of course it ought to
be considered But you know you are only going to set common hens and
you do not intend to raise any Now are those four hens to do all the
setting and motherwork for five years and eventually bring up over
sixtyfour thousand chickens

Well I DID make a mistake there she said coloring a little Ill
tell you what Ill do Ill set every one of my hens every year

But all those chickens may not be hens You have calculated that every
one of them would set as soon as it was old enough

She stopped a minute to think this over

Two heads are better than one I see she said directly Ill allow
that onehalf of all the chickens are roosters and that will make the
profits twentyfour thousand three hundred dollarsmore than enough to
buy this place

Ever so much more I cried This Rudder Grange is ours



CHAPTER IX WE CAMP OUT


My wife and I were both so fond of country life and country pursuits
that month after month passed by at our little farm in a succession of
delightful days Time flew like a limited express train and it was
September before we knew it

I had been working very hard at the office that summer and was glad to
think of my two weeks vacation which were to begin on the first
Monday of the month I had intended spending these two weeks in
rural retirement at home but an interview in the city with my family
physician caused me to change my mind I told him my plan

Now said he if I were you Id do nothing of the kind You have
been working too hard your face shows it You need rest and change
Nothing will do you so much good as to camp out that will be fifty
times better than going to any summer resort You can take your wife
with you I know shell like it I dont care where you go so that its
a healthy spot Get a good tent and an outfit be off to the woods and
forget all about business and domestic matters for a few weeks

This sounded splendid and I propounded the plan to Euphemia that
evening She thought very well of it and was sure we could do it
Pomona would not be afraid to remain in the house under the protection
of Lord Edward and she could easily attend to the cow and the chickens
It would be a holiday for her too Old John the man who occasionally
worked for us would come up sometimes and see after things With her
customary dexterity Euphemia swept away every obstacle to the plan and
all was settled before we went to bed

As my wife had presumed Pomona made no objections to remaining in
charge of the house The scheme pleased her greatly So far so good I
called that day on a friend who was in the habit of camping out to talk
to him about getting a tent and the necessary traps for a life in the
woods He proved perfectly competent to furnish advice and everything
else He offered to lend me all I needed He had a complete outfit had
done with them for the year and I was perfectly welcome Here was rare
luck He gave me a tent campstove dishes pots gun fishingtackle
a big canvas coat with dozens of pockets riveted on it a canvas hat
rods reels boots that came up to my hips and about a wagonload of
things in all He was a real good fellow

We laid in a stock of canned and condensed provisions and I bought
a book on camping out so as to be well posted on the subject On
the Saturday before the first Monday in September we would have been
entirely ready to start had we decided on the place where we were to go

We found it very difficult to make this decision There were thousands
of places where people went to camp out but none of them seemed to be
the place for us Most of them were too far away We figured up the cost
of taking ourselves and our camp equipage to the Adirondacks the lakes
the troutstreams of Maine or any of those wellknown resorts and we
found that we could not afford such trips especially for a vacation of
but fourteen days

On Sunday afternoon we took a little walk Our minds were still troubled
about the spot toward which we ought to journey next day and we needed
the soothing influences of Nature The country to the north and west of
our little farm was very beautiful About half a mile from the house
a modest river ran on each side of it were grasscovered fields and
hills and in some places there were extensive tracks of woodlands

Look here exclaimed Euphemia stopping short in the little path that
wound along by the river bank Do you see this river those woods
those beautiful fields with not a soul in them or anywhere near them
and those lovely blue mountains over thereas she spoke she waved
her parasol in the direction of the objects indicated and I could not
mistake them Now what could we want better than this she continued
Here we can fish and do everything that we want to I say let us camp
here on our own river I can take you to the very spot for the tent
Come on And she was so excited about it that she fairly ran

The spot she pointed out was one we had frequently visited in our rural
walks It was a grassy peninsula as I termed it formed by a sudden
turn of a creek which a short distance below flowed into the river
It was a very secluded spot The place was approached through a
pasturefieldwe had found it by mere accidentand where the
peninsula joined the field we had to climb a fence just there there
was a cluster of chestnut and hickory trees while down near the point
stood a widespreading oak

Here under this oak is the place for the tent said Euphemia her
face flushed her eyes sparkling and her dress a little torn by getting
over the fence in a hurry What do we want with your Adirondacks and
your Dismal Swamps This is the spot for us

Euphemia said I in as composed a tone as possible although my whole
frame was trembling with emotion Euphemia I am glad I married you

Had it not been Sunday we would have set up our tent that night

Early the next morning old Johns fifteendollar horse drew from
our house a wagonload of campfixtures There was some difficulty in
getting the wagon over the field and there were fences to be taken down
to allow of its passage but we overcame all obstacles and reached the
campground without breaking so much as a teacup Old John helped me
pitch the tent and as neither of us understood the matter very well
it took us some time It was indeed nearly noon when old John left us
and it may have been possible that he delayed matters a little so as to
be able to charge for a full halfday for himself and horse Euphemia
got into the wagon to ride back with him that she might give some
parting injunctions to Pomona

Ill have to stop a bit to put up the fences maam said old John
or Misther Ball might make a fuss

Is this Mr Balls land I asked

Oh yes sir its Mr Balls land

I wonder how hell like our camping on it I said thoughtfully

Id a thought sir youd a asked him that before you came said
old John in a tone that seemed to indicate that he had his doubts about
Mr Ball

Oh therell be no trouble about that cried Euphemia You can drive
me past Mr Ballsits not much out of the wayand Ill ask him

In that wagon said I Will you stop at Mr Balls door in that

Certainly said she as she arranged herself on the board which served
as a seat Now that our campaign has really commenced we ought to
begin to rough it and should not be too proud to ride even in ain
a

She evidently couldnt think of any vehicle mean enough for her purpose

In a greengrocery cart I suggested

Yes or in a red one Go ahead John

When Euphemia returned on foot I had a fire in the campstove and the
kettle was on

Well said Euphemia Mr Ball says its all right if we keep the
fence up He dont want his cows to get into the creek and Im sure we
dont want em walking over us He couldnt understand though why
we wanted to live out here I explained the whole thing to him very
carefully but it didnt seem to make much impression on him I believe
he thinks Pomona has something the matter with her and that we have
come to stay out here in the fresh air so as not to take it

What an extremely stupid man Mr Ball must be I said

The fire did not burn very well and while I was at work at it Euphemia
spread a cloth upon the grass and set forth bread and butter cheese
sardines potted ham preserves biscuits and a lot of other things

We did not wait for the kettle to boil but concluded to do without tea
or coffee for this meal and content ourselves with pure water For
some reason or other however the creek water did not seem to be very
pure and we did not like it a bit

After lunch said I we will go and look for a spring that will be a
good way of exploring the country

If we cant find one said Euphemia we shall have to go to the house
for water for I can never drink that stuff

Soon after lunch we started out We searched high and low near and far
for a spring but could not find one

At length by merest accident we found ourselves in the vicinity of old
Johns little house I knew he had a good well and so we went in to get
a drink for our ham and biscuits had made us very thirsty

We told old John who was digging potatoes and was also very much
surprised to see us so soon about our unexpected trouble in finding a
spring

No said he very slowly there is no spring very near to you Didnt
you tell your gal to bring you water

No I replied we dont want her coming down to the camp She is to
attend to the house

Oh very well said John I will bring you water morning and
nightgood fresh waterfrom my well forwell for ten cents a
day

That will be nice said Euphemia and cheap too And then it will be
well to have John come every day he can carry our letters

I dont expect to write any letters

Neither do I said Euphemia but it will be pleasant to have some
communication with the outer world

So we engaged old John to bring us water twice a day I was a little
disappointed at this for I thought that camping on the edge of a stream
settled the matter of water But we have many things to learn in this
world

Early in the afternoon I went out to catch some fish for supper We
agreed to dispense with dinner and have breakfast lunch and a good
solid supper

For some time I had poor luck There were either very few fish in the
creek or they were not hungry

I had been fishing an hour or more when I saw Euphemia running toward
me

Whats the matter said I

Oh nothing Ive just come to see how you were getting along Havent
you been gone an awfully long time And are those all the fish youve
caught What little bits of things they are I thought people who camped
out caught big fish and lots of them

That depends a good deal upon where they go said I

Yes I suppose so replied Euphemia but I should think a stream as
big as this would have plenty of fish in it However if you cant
catch any you might go up to the road and watch for Mr Mulligan He
sometimes comes along on Mondays

Im not going to the road to watch for any fishman I replied a
little more testily than I should have spoken What sort of a camping
out would that be But we must not be talking here or I shall never get
a bite Those fish are a little soiled from jumping about in the dust
You might wash them off at that shallow place while I go a little
further on and try my luck

I went a short distance up the creek and threw my line into a dark
shadowy pool under some alders where there certainly should be fish
And sure enough in less than a minute I got a splendid bitenot only
a bite but a pull I knew that I had certainly hooked a big fish The
thing actually tugged at my line so that I was afraid the pole would
break I did not fear for the line for that I knew was strong I
would have played the fish until he was tired and I could pull him out
without risk to the pole but I did not know exactly how the process
of playing was conducted I was very much excited Sometimes I gave a
jerk and a pull and then the fish would give a jerk and a pull

Directly I heard some one running toward me and then I heard Euphemia
cry out

Give him the butt Give him the butt

Give him what I exclaimed without having time even to look up at
her

The butt the butt she cried almost breathlessly I know thats
right I read how Edward Everett Hale did it in the Adirondacks

No it wasnt Hale at all said I as I jumped about the bank it was
Mr Murray

Well it was one of those fishing ministers and I know that it caught
the fish

I know I know I read it but I dont know how to do it

Perhaps you ought to punch him with it said she

No no I hurriedly replied I cant do anything like that Im going
to try to just pull him out lengthwise You take hold of the pole and go
in shore as far as you can and Ill try and get hold of the line

Euphemia did as I bade her and drew the line in so that I could reach
it As soon as I had a firm hold of it I pulled in regardless of
consequences and hauled ashore an enormous catfish

Hurrah I shouted here is a prize

Euphemia dropped the pole and ran to me

What a horrid beast she exclaimed Throw it in again

Not at all said I This is a splendid fish if I can ever get him
off the hook Dont come near him If he sticks that backfin into you
it will poison you

Then I should think it would poison us to eat him said she

No its only his fin

Ive eaten catfish but I never saw one like that she said Look at
its horrible mouth And it has whiskers like a cat

Oh you never saw one with its head on I said What I want to do is
to get this hook out

I had caught catfish before but never one so large as this and I was
actually afraid to take hold of it knowing as I did that you must be
very careful how you clutch a fish of the kind I finally concluded to
carry it home as it was and then I could decapitate it and take out
the hook at my leisure So back to camp we went Euphemia picking up the
little fish as we passed for she did not think it right to catch fish
and not eat them They made her hands smell it is true but she did not
mind that when we were camping

I prepared the big fish and I had a desperate time getting the skin
off while my wife who is one of the daintiest cooks in the world
made the fire in the stove and got ready the rest of the supper She
fried the fish because I told her that was the way catfish ought to be
cooked although she said that it seemed very strange to her to camp out
for the sake of ones health and then to eat fried food

But that fish was splendid The very smell of it made us hungry
Everything was good and when supper was over and the dishes washed I
lighted my pipe and we sat down under a tree to enjoy the evening

The sun had set behind the distant ridge a delightful twilight was
gently subduing every color of the scene the night insects were
beginning to hum and chirp and a fire that I had made under a tree
blazed up gayly and threw little flakes of light into the shadows under
the shrubbery

Now isnt this better than being cooped up in a narrow constricted
house said I

Ever so much better said Euphemia Now we know what Nature is We
are sitting right down in her lap and she is cuddling us up Isnt that
sky lovely Oh I think this is perfectly splendid said she making a
little dab at her faceif it wasnt for the mosquitoes

They ARE bad I said I thought my pipe would keep them off but it
dont There must be plenty of them down at that creek

Down there exclaimed Euphemia Why there are thousands of them here
I never saw anything like it Theyre getting worse every minute

Ill tell you what we must do I exclaimed jumping up We must make
a smudge

Whats that do you rub it on yourself asked Euphemia anxiously

No its only a great smoke Come let us gather up dry leaves and make
a smoldering fire of them

We managed to get up a very fair smudge and we stood to the leeward of
it until Euphemia began to cough and sneeze as if her head would
come off With tears running from her eyes she declared that she would
rather go and be eaten alive than stay in that smoke

Perhaps we were too near it said I

That may be she answered but I have had enough smoke Why didnt
I think of it before I brought two veils We can put these over our
faces and wear gloves

She was always full of expedients

Veiled and gloved we bade defiance to the mosquitoes and we sat
and talked for half an hour or more I made a little hole in my veil
through which I put the mouthpiece of my pipe

When it became really dark I lighted the lantern and we prepared for a
wellearned nights rest The tent was spacious and comfortable and we
each had a nice little cotbed

Are you going to leave the frontdoor open all night said Euphemia
as I came in after a final round to see that all was right

I should hardly call this canvasflap a frontdoor I said but I
think it would be better to leave it open otherwise we should smother
You need not be afraid I shall keep my gun here by my bedside and if
any one offers to come in Ill bring him to a full stop quick enough

Yes if you are awake But I suppose we ought not to be afraid of
burglars here People in tents never are So you neednt shut it

It was awfully quiet and dark and lonely out there by that creek when
the light had been put out and we had gone to bed For some reason I
could not go to sleep After I had been lying awake for an hour or two
Euphemia spoke

Are you awake said she in a low voice as if she were afraid of
disturbing the people in the next room

Yes said I How long have you been awake

I havent been asleep

Neither have I

Suppose we light the lantern said she Dont you think it would be
pleasanter

It might be I replied but it would draw myriads of mosquitoes
I wish I had brought a mosquitonet and a clock It seems so lonesome
without the ticking Goodnight We ought to have a long sleep if we do
much tramping about tomorrow

In about half an hour more just as I was beginning to be a little
sleepy she said

Where is that gun

Here by me I answered

Well if a man should come in try and be sure to put it up close to
him before you fire In a little tent like this the shot might scatter
everywhere if youre not careful

All right I said Goodnight

Theres one thing we never thought of she presently exclaimed

Whats that said I

Snakes said she

Well dont lets think of them We must try and get a little sleep

Dear knows Ive been trying hard enough she said plaintively and
all was quiet again

We succeeded this time in going to sleep and it was broad daylight
before we awoke

That morning old John came with our water before breakfast was ready
He also brought us some milk as he thought we would want it We
considered this a good idea and agreed with him to bring us a quart a
day

Dont you want some wegetables said he Ive got some nice corn and
some tomatoes and I could bring you cabbage and peas

We had hardly expected to have fresh vegetables every day but there
seemed to be no reason why old John should not bring them as he had to
come every day with the water and milk So we arranged that he should
furnish us daily with a few of the products of his garden

I could go to the butchers and get you a steak or some chops if youd
let me know in the morning said he intent on the profits of further
commissions

But this was going too far We remembered we were camping out and
declined to have meat from the butcher

John had not been gone more than ten minutes before we saw Mr Ball
approaching

Oh I hope he isnt going to say we cant stay exclaimed Euphemia

How dye do said Mr Ball shaking hands with us Did you stick it
out all night

Oh yes indeed I replied and expect to stick it out for a many more
nights if you dont object to our occupying your land

No objection in the world said he but it seems a little queer for
people who have a good house to be living out here in the fields in a
tent now dont it

Oh but you see said I and I went on and explained the whole thing
to himthe advice of the doctor the discussion about the proper place
to go to and the good reasons for fixing on this spot

Yees said he thats all very well no doubt But hows the girl

What girl I asked

Your girl The hired girl you left at the house

Oh shes all right said I shes always well

Well said Mr Ball slowly turning on his heel if you say so I
suppose she is But youre going up to the house today to see about
her arent you

Oh no said Euphemia We dont intend to go near the house until our
camping is over

Just sojust so said Mr Ball I expected as much But look here
dont you think it would be well for me to ask Dr Ames to stop in and
see how she is gettin along I dare say youve fixed everything for
her but that would be safer you know Hes coming this morning to
vaccinate my baby and he might stop there just as well as not after
he has left my house

Euphemia and I could see no necessity for this proposed visit of the
doctor but we could not well object to it and so Mr Ball said he
would be sure and send him

After our visitor had gone the significance of his remarks flashed on
me He still thought that Pomona was sick with something catching and
that we were afraid to stay in the house with her But I said nothing
about this to Euphemia It would only worry her and our vacation was to
be a season of unalloyed delight



CHAPTER X WET BLANKETS


We certainly enjoyed our second day in camp All the morning and a
great part of the afternoon we explored We fastened up the tent
as well as we could and then I with my gun and Euphemia with the
fishingpole we started up the creek We did not go very far for it
would not do to leave the tent too long I did not shoot anything but
Euphemia caught two or three nice little fish and we enjoyed the sport
exceedingly

Soon after we returned in the afternoon and while we were getting
things in order for supper we had a call from two of our neighbors
Captain Atkinson and wife The captain greeted us hilariously

Hello he cried Why this is gay Who would ever have thought of
a domestic couple like you going on such a lark as this We just heard
about it from old John and we came down to see what you are up to
Youve got everything very nice I think Id like this myself Why you
might have a riflerange out here You could cut down those bushes on
the other side of the creek and put up your target over there on that
hill Then you could lie down here on the grass and bang away all day
If youll do that Ill come down and practice with you How long are
you going to keep it up

I told him that we expected to spend my two weeks vacation here

Not if it rains my boy said he I know what it is to camp out in
the rain

Meanwhile Mrs Atkinson had been with Euphemia examining the tent and
our equipage generally

It would be very nice for a days picnic she said but I wouldnt
want to stay outofdoors all night

And then addressing me she asked

Do you have to breathe the fresh air all the time night as well as
day I expect that is a very good prescription but I would not like to
have to follow it myself

If the fresh air is what you must have said the captain you might
have got all you wanted of that without taking the trouble to come out
here You could have sat out on your back porch night and day for the
whole two weeks and breathed all the fresh air that any man could
need

Yes said I and I might have gone down cellar and put my head in the
coldair box of the furnace But there wouldnt have been much fun in
that

There are a good many things that theres no fun in said the captain
Do you cook your own meals or have them sent from the house

Cook them ourselves of course said Euphemia We are going to have
supper now Wont you wait and take some

Thank you said Mrs Atkinson but we must go

Yes we must be going said the captain Goodbye If it rains Ill
come down after you with an umbrella

You need not trouble yourself about that said I We shall rough it
out rain or shine

Id stay here now said Euphemia when they had gone if it rained
pitch

You mean pitchforks I suggested

Yes anything she answered

Well I dont know about the pitchforks I said looking over the
creek at the sky but am very much afraid that it is going to rain
rainwater tomorrow But that wont drive us home will it

No indeed said she Were prepared for it But I wish theyd staid
at home

Sure enough it commenced to rain that night and we had showers all
the next day We staid in camp during the morning and I smoked and
we played checkers and had a very cosy time with a wood fire burning
under a tree near by We kept up this fire not to dry the air but to
make things look comfortable In the afternoon I dressed myself up in
waterproof coat boots and hat and went out fishing I went down to
the water and fished along the banks for an hour but caught nothing of
any consequence This was a great disappointment for we had expected to
live on fresh fish for a great part of the time while we were camping
With plenty of fish we could do without meat very well

We talked the matter over on my return and we agreed that as it seemed
impossible to depend upon a supply of fish from the waters about our
camp it would be better to let old John bring fresh meat from the
butcher and as neither of us liked crackers we also agreed that he
should bring bread

Our greatest trouble that evening was to make a fire The wood of
which there was a good deal lying about under the trees was now all wet
and would not burn However we managed to get up a fire in the stove
but I did not know what we were going to do in the morning We should
have stored away some wood under shelter

We set our little camptable in the tent and we had scarcely finished
our supper when a very heavy rain set in accompanied by a violent
wind The canvas at one end of our tent must have been badly fastened
for it was blown in and in an instant our beds were deluged I rushed
out to fasten up the canvas and got drenched almost to the skin and
although Euphemia put on her waterproof cloak as soon as she could she
was pretty wet for the rain seemed to dash right through the tent

This gust of wind did not last long and the rain soon settled down into
a steady drizzle but we were in a sad plight It was after nine oclock
before we had put things into tolerable order

We cant sleep in those beds said Euphemia

Theyre as wet as sop and we shall have to go up to the house and get
something to spread over them I dont want to do it but we mustnt
catch our deaths of cold

There was nothing to be said against this and we prepared to start out
I would have gone by myself but Euphemia would not consent to be left
alone It was still raining though not very hard and I carried an
umbrella and a lantern Climbing fences at night with a wife a lantern
and an umbrella to take care of is not very agreeable but we managed
to reach the house although once or twice we had an argument in regard
to the path which seemed to be very different at night from what it was
in the daytime

Lord Edward came bounding to the gate to meet us and I am happy to say
that he knew me at once and wagged his tail in a very sociable way

I had the key of a sidedoor in my pocket for we had thought it wise to
give ourselves command of this door and so we let ourselves in without
ringing or waking Pomona

All was quiet within and we went upstairs with the lantern Everything
seemed clean and in order and it is impossible to convey any idea of
the element of comfort which seemed to pervade the house as we quietly
made our way upstairs in our wet boots and heavy damp clothes

The articles we wanted were in a closet and while I was making a bundle
of them Euphemia went to look for Pomona She soon returned walking
softly

Shes sound asleep said she and I didnt think there was any need
of waking her Well send word by John that weve been here And oh
you cant imagine how snug and happy she did look lying there in her
comfortable bed in that nice airy room Ill tell you what it is if
it wasnt for the neighbors and especially the Atkinsons I wouldnt go
back one step

Well said I I dont know that I care so particularly about it
myself But I suppose I couldnt stay here and leave all Thompsons
things out there to take care of themselves

Oh no said Euphemia And were not going to back down Are you
ready

On our way downstairs we had to pass the partly open door of our own
room I could not help holding up the lantern to look in There was the
bed with its fair white covering and its smooth soft pillows there
were the easychairs the pretty curtains the neat and cheerful carpet
the bureau with Euphemias workbasket on it there was the little
table with the book that we had been reading together turned face
downward upon it there were my slippers there was

Come said Euphemia I cant bear to look in there Its like a dead
child

And so we hurried out into the night and the rain We stopped at the
woodshed and got an armful of dry kindling which Euphemia was obliged
to carry as I had the bundle of bedclothing the umbrella and the
lantern

Lord Edward gave a short peculiar bark as we shut the gate behind us
but whether it was meant as a fond farewell or a hoot of derision I
cannot say

We found everything as we left it at the camp and we made our beds
apparently dry But I did not sleep well I could not help thinking that
it was not safe to sleep in a bed with a substratum of wet mattress and
I worried Euphemia a little by asking her several times if she felt the
dampness striking through

To our great delight the next day was fine and clear and I thought I
would like better than anything else to take Euphemia in a boat up the
river and spend the day rowing about or resting in shady places on the
shore

But what could we do about the tent It would be impossible to go away
and leave that with its contents for a whole day

When old John came with our water milk bread and a basket of
vegetables we told him of our desired excursion and the difficulty in
the way This good man who always had a keen scent for any advantage
to himself warmly praised the boating plan and volunteered to send his
wife and two of his younger children to stay with the tent while we were
away

The old woman he said could do her sewing here as well as anywhere
and she would stay all day for fifty cents

This plan pleased us and we sent for Mrs Old John who came with three
of her childrenall too young to leave behind she saidand took
charge of the camp

Our day proved to be as delightful as we had anticipated and when we
returned hungry and tired we were perfectly charmed to find that Mrs
Old John had our supper ready for us

She charged a quarter extra for this service and we did not begrudge
it to her though we declined her offer to come every day and cook and
keep the place in order

However said Euphemia on second thoughts you may come on Saturday
and clean up generally

The next day which was Friday I went out in the morning with the
gun As yet I had shot nothing for I had seen no birds about the camp
which without breaking the State laws I thought I could kill and so I
started off up the riverroad

I saw no game but after I had walked about a mile I met a man in a
wagon

Hello said he pulling up youd better be careful how you go
popping around here on the public roads frightening horses

As I had not yet fired a single shot I thought this was a very impudent
speech and I think so still

You had better wait until I begin to pop said I before you make
such a fuss about it

No said he Id rather make the fuss before you begin My horse is
skittish and he drove off

This man annoyed me but as I did not of course wish to frighten
horses I left the road and made my way back to the tent over some very
rough fields It was a poor day for birds and I did not get a shot

What a foolish man said Euphemia when I told her the above incident
to talk that way when you stood there with a gun in your hand You
might have raked his wagon fore and aft

That afternoon as Euphemia and I were sitting under a tree by the
tent we were very much surprised to see Pomona come walking down the
peninsula

I was annoyed and provoked at this We had given Pomona positive orders
not to leave the place under any pretense while we were gone If
necessary to send for anything she could go to the fence back of the
barn and scream across a small field to some of the numerous members
of old Johns family Under this arrangement I felt that the house was
perfectly safe

Before she could reach us I called out

Why did you leave the house Pomona Dont you know you should never
come away and leave the house empty I thought I had made you understand
that

It isnt empty said Pomona in an entirely unruffled tone Your old
boarder is there with his wife and child

Euphemia and I looked at each other in dismay

They came early this afternoon continued Pomona by the 114 train
and walked up he carrying the child

It cant be cried Euphemia Their childs married

It must have married very young then said Pomona for it isnt over
four years old now

Oh said Euphemia I know Its his grandchild

Grandchild repeated Pomona with her countenance more expressive of
emotion than I had ever yet seen it

Yes said Euphemia but how long are they going to stay Where did
you tell them we were

They didnt say how long they was goin to stay answered Pomona I
told them you had gone to be with some friends in the country and that
I didnt know whether youd be home tonight or not

How could you tell them such a falsehood cried Euphemia

That was no falsehood said Pomona it was true as truth If youre
not your own friends I dont know who is And I wasnt agoin to tell
the boarder where you was till I found out whether you wanted me to do
it or not And so I left em and run over to old Johns and then down
here

It was impossible to find fault with the excellent management of Pomona

What were they doing asked Euphemia

I opened the parlor and she was in there with the childputting it
to sleep on the sofa I think The boarder was out in the yard tryin
to teach Lord Edward some tricks

He had better look out I exclaimed

Oh the dogs chained and growlin fearful What am I to do with em

This was a difficult point to decide If we went to see them we might
as well break up our camp for we could not tell when we should be able
to come back to it

We discussed the matter very anxiously and finally concluded that
under the circumstances and considering what Pomona had said about
our whereabouts it would be well for us to stay where we were and for
Pomona to take charge of the visitors If they returned to the city that
evening she was to give them a good supper before they went sending
John to the store for what was needed If they stayed all night she
could get breakfast for them

We can write said Euphemia and invite them to come and spend some
days with us when we are at home and everything is all right I want
dreadfully to see that child but I dont see how I can do it now

No said I Theyre sure to stay all night if we go up to the house
and then I should have to have the tent and things hauled away for I
couldnt leave them here

The fact is said Euphemia if we were miles away in the woods
of Maine we couldnt leave our camp to see anybody And this is
practically the same

Certainly said I and so Pomona went away to her new charge



CHAPTER XI THE BOARDERS VISIT


For the rest of the afternoon and indeed far into the night our
conversation consisted almost entirely of conjectures regarding the
probable condition of things at the house We both thought we had done
right but we felt badly about it It was not hospitable to be sure
but then I should have no other holiday until next year and our friends
could come at any time to see us

The next morning old John brought a note from Pomona It was written
with pencil on a small piece of paper torn from the margin of a
newspaper and contained the words Here yit

So youve got company said old John with a smile Thats a queer
gal of yourn She says I mustnt tell em youre here As if Id tell
em

We knew well enough that old John was not at all likely to do anything
that would cut off the nice little revenue he was making out of our
camp and so we felt no concern on that score

But we were very anxious for further news and we told old John to go to
the house about ten oclock and ask Pomona to send us another note

We waited in a very disturbed condition of mind until nearly eleven
oclock when old John came with a verbal message from Pomona

She says shes acomin herself as soon as she can get a chance to slip
off

This was not pleasant news It filled our minds with a confused mass of
probabilities and it made us feel mean How contemptible it seemed to
be a party to this concealment and in league with a servantgirl who has
to slip off

Before long Pomona appeared quite out of breath

In all my life said she I never see people like them two I thought
I was never goin to get away

Are they there yet cried Euphemia

How long are they going to stay

Dear knows replied Pomona Their valise came up by express last
night

Oh well have to go up to the house said Euphemia It wont do to
stay away any longer

Well said Pomona fanning herself with her apron if you knowd all
I know I dont think youd think so

What do you mean said Euphemia

Well maam theyve just settled down and taken possession of the
whole place He says to me that he knowd youd both want them to make
themselves at home just as if you was there and they thought theyd
better do it He asked me did I think you would be home by Monday and
I said I didnt know but I guessed you would So says he to his wife
Wont that be a jolly lark Well just keep house for them here till
they come And he says he would go down to the store and order some
things if there wasnt enough in the house and he asked her to see
what would be needed which she did and hes gone down for em now And
she says that as it was Saturday shed see that the house was all put
to rights and after breakfast she set me to sweepin and its only by
way of her dustin the parlor and givin me the little girl to take for
a walk that I got off at all

But what have you done with the child exclaimed Euphemia

Oh I left her at old Johnses

And so you think theyre pleased with having the house to themselves
I said

Pleased sir replied Pomona theyre tickled to death

But how do you like having strangers telling you what to do asked
Euphemia

Oh well said Pomona hes no stranger and shes real pleasant and
if it gives you a good camp out I dont mind

Euphemia and I looked at each other Here was true allegiance We would
remember this

Pomona now hurried off and we seriously discussed the matter and soon
came to the conclusion that while it might be the truest hospitality to
let our friends stay at our house for a day or two and enjoy themselves
still it would not do for us to allow ourselves to be governed by a too
delicate sentimentality We must go home and act our part of host and
hostess

Mrs Old John had been at the camp ever since breakfasttime giving the
place a Saturday cleaning What she had found to occupy her for so
long a time I could not imagine but in her efforts to put in a full
halfdays work I have no doubt she scrubbed some of the trees We had
been so fully occupied with our own affairs that we had paid very little
attention to her but she had probably heard pretty much all that had
been said

At noon we paid her giving her at her suggestion something extra in
lieu of the midday meal which she did not stay to take and told her
to send her husband with his wagon as soon as possible as we intended
to break up our encampment We determined that we would pack everything
in Johns wagon and let him take the load to his house and keep
it there until Monday when I would have the tent and accompaniments
expressed to their owner We would go home and join our friends It
would not be necessary to say where we had been

It was hard for us to break up our camp In many respects we had enjoyed
the novel experience and we had fully expected during the next week
to make up for all our shortcomings and mistakes It seemed like losing
all our labor and expenditure to break up now but there was no help
for it Our place was at home

We did not wish to invite our friends to the camp They would certainly
have come had they known we were there but we had no accommodations for
them neither had we any desire for even transient visitors Besides
we both thought that we would prefer that our exboarder and his wife
should not know that we were encamped on that little peninsula

We set to work to pack up and get ready for moving but the afternoon
passed away without bringing old John Between five and six oclock
along came his oldest boy with a bucket of water

Im to go back after the milk he said

Hold up I cried Where is your father and his wagon Weve been
waiting for him for hours

The horse is si I mean hes gone to Ballville for oats

And why didnt he send and tell me I asked

There wasnt nobody to send answered the boy

You are not telling the truth exclaimed Euphemia there is always
some one to send in a family like yours

To this the boy made no answer but again said that he would go after
the milk

We want you to bring no milk I cried now quite angry I want you to
go down to the station and tell the driver of the expresswagon to come
here immediately Do you understand Immediately

The boy declared he understood and started off quite willingly We
did not prefer to have the expresswagon for it was too public a
conveyance and besides old John knew exactly how to do what was
required But we need not have troubled ourselves The expresswagon did
not come

When it became dark we saw that we could not leave that night Even if
a wagon did come it would not be safe to drive over the fields in
the darkness And we could not go away and leave the campequipage I
proposed that Euphemia should go up to the house while I remained in
camp But she declined We would keep together whatever happened she
said

We unpacked our cookingutensils and provisions and had supper There
was no milk for our coffee but we did not care The evening did
not pass gayly We were annoyed by the conduct of old John and the
expressboy though perhaps it was not their fault I had given them
no notice that I should need them

And we were greatly troubled at the continuance of the secrecy and
subterfuge which now had become really necessary if we did not wish to
hurt our friends feelings

The first thing that I thought of when I opened my eyes in the morning
was the fact that we would have to stay there all day for we could not
move on Sunday

But Euphemia did not agree with me After breakfast we found that the
water and the milk had been brought very early before we were up she
stated that she did not intend to be treated in this way She was going
up to old Johns house herself and away she went

In less than half an hour she returned followed by old John and his
wife both looking much as if they had been whipped

These people said she have entered into a conspiracy against us I
have questioned them thoroughly and have made them answer me The horse
was at home yesterday and the boy did not go after the expresswagon
They thought that if they could keep us here until our company had
gone we would stay as long as we originally intended and they would
continue to make money out of us But they are mistaken We are going
home immediately

At this point I could not help thinking that Euphemia might have
consulted me in regard to her determination but she was very much in
earnest and I would not have any discussion before these people

Now listen said Euphemia addressing the downcast couple we are
going home and you two are to stay here all this day and tonight and
take care of these things You cant work today and you can shut up
your house and bring your whole family here if you choose We will pay
you for the servicealthough you do not deserve a centand we will
leave enough here for you to eat You must bring your own sheets and
pillowcases and stay here until we see you on Monday morning

Old John and his wife agreed to this plan with the greatest alacrity
apparently well pleased to get off so easily and having locked up the
smaller articles of campfurniture we filled a valise with our personal
baggage and started off home

Our house and grounds never looked prettier than they did that morning
as we stood at the gate Lord Edward barked a welcome from his shed and
before we reached the door Pomona came running out her face radiant

Im awful glad to see you back she said though Id never have said
so while you was in camp

I patted the dog and looked into the garden Everything was growing
splendidly Euphemia rushed to the chickenyard It was in firstrate
order and there were two broods of little yellow puffy chicks

Down on her knees went my wife to pick up the little creatures one
by one press their downy bodies to her cheek and call them
tootsywootsies and away went I to the barn followed by Pomona and
soon afterward by Euphemia

The cow was all right

Ive been making butter said Pomona though it dont look exactly
like it ought to yet and the skimmilk I didnt know what to do with
so I gave it to old John He came for it every day and was real mad
once because I had given a lot of it to the dog and couldnt let him
have but a pint

He ought to have been mad said I to Euphemia as we walked up to the
house He got ten cents a quart for that milk

We laughed and didnt care We were too glad to be at home

But where are our friends I asked Pomona We had actually forgotten
them

Oh theyre gone out for a walk said she They started off right
after breakfast

We were not sorry for this It would be so much nicer to see our dear
home again when there was nobody there but ourselves Indoors we
rushed Our absence had been like rain on a garden Everything now
seemed fresher and brighter and more delightful We went from room to
room and seemed to appreciate better than ever what a charming home we
had

We were so full of the delights of our return that we forgot all about
the Sunday dinner and our guests but Pomona whom my wife was training
to be an excellent cook did not forget and Euphemia was summoned to a
consultation in the kitchen

Dinner was late but our guests were later We waited as long as the
state of the provisions and our appetites would permit and then we sat
down to the table and began to eat slowly But they did not come We
finished our meal and they were still absent We now became quite
anxious and I proposed to Euphemia that we should go and look for them

We started out and our steps naturally turned toward the river An
unpleasant thought began to crowd itself into my mind and perhaps the
same thing happened to Euphemia for without saying anything to each
other we both turned toward the path that led to the peninsula We
crossed the field climbed the fence and there in front of the tent
sat our old boarder splitting sticks with the camphatchet

Hurrah he cried springing to his feet when he saw us How glad I am
to see you back When did you return Isnt this splendid

What I said as we shook hands

Why this he cried pointing to the tent Dont you see Were
camping out

You are I exclaimed looking around for his wife while Euphemia
stood motionless actually unable to make a remark

Certainly we are Its the rarest bit of luck My wife and Adele will
be here directly Theyve gone to look for watercresses But I must
tell you how I came to make this magnificent find We started out for a
walk this morning and we happened to hit on this place and here we saw
this gorgeous tent with nobody near but a little towheaded boy

Only a boy cried Euphemia

Yes a young shaver of about nine or ten I asked him what he was doing
here and he told me that this tent belonged to a gentleman who had gone
away and that he was here to watch it until he came back Then I asked
him how long the owner would probably be away and he said he supposed
for a day or two Then a splendid idea struck me I offered the boy
a dollar to let me take his place I knew that any sensible man would
rather have me in charge of his tent than a young codger like that The
boy agreed as quick as lightning and I paid him and sent him off You
see how little he was to be trusted The owner of this tent will be
under the greatest obligations to me Just look at it he cried Beds
table stoveeverything anybody could want Ive camped out lots of
times but never had such a tent as this I intended coming up this
afternoon after my valise and to tell your girl where we are But here
is my wife and little Adele

In the midst of the salutations and the mutual surprise Euphemia cried

But you dont expect to camp out now You are coming back to our
house

You see said the exboarder we should never have thought of doing
anything so rude had we supposed you would have returned so soon But
your girl gave us to understand that you would not be back for days and
so we felt free to go at any time and I did not hesitate to make this
arrangement And now that I have really taken the responsibility of the
tent and fixtures on myself I dont think it would be right to go away
and leave the place especially as I dont know where to find that boy
The owner will be back in a day or two and I would like to explain
matters to him and give up the property in good order into his hands
And to tell the truth we both adore campingout and we may never have
such a chance again We can live here splendidly I went out to forage
this morning and found an old fellow living near by who sold me a lot
of provisionseven some coffee and sugarand hes to bring us some
milk Were going to have supper in about an hour wont you stay and
take a campmeal with us It will be a novelty for you at any rate

We declined this invitation as we had so lately dined I looked at
Euphemia with a question in my eye She understood me and gently shook
her head It would be a shame to make any explanations which might put
an end to this bit of camplife which evidently was so eagerly enjoyed
by our old friend But we insisted that they should come up to the
house and see us and they agreed to dine with us the next evening On
Tuesday they must return to the city

Now this is what I call real hospitality said the exboarder warmly
grasping my hand I could not help agreeing with him

As we walked home I happened to look back and saw old John going over
the fields toward the camp carrying a little tinpail and a water
bucket

The next day toward evening a storm set in and at the hour fixed for
our dinner the rain was pouring down in such torrents that we did not
expect our guests After dinner the rain ceased and as we supposed that
they might not have made any preparations for a meal Euphemia packed up
some dinner for them in a basket and I took it down to the camp

They were glad to see me and said they had a splendid time all day
They were up before sunrise and had explored tramped boated and I
dont know what else

My basket was very acceptable and I would have stayed awhile with them
but as they were obliged to eat in the tent there was no place for me
to sit it being too wet outside and so I soon came away

We were in doubt whether or not to tell our friends the true history
of the camp I thought that it was not right to keep up the deception
while Euphemia declared that if they were sensitive people they would
feel very badly at having broken up our plans by their visit and then
having appropriated our camp to themselves She thought it would be the
part of magnanimity to say nothing about it

I could not help seeing a good deal of force in her arguments although
I wished very much to set the thing straight and we discussed the
matter again as we walked down to the camp after breakfast next
morning

There we found old John sitting on a stump He said nothing but handed
me a note written in leadpencil on a card It was from our exboarder
and informed me that early that morning he had found that there was a
tug lying in the river which would soon start for the city He also
found that he could get passage on her for his party and as this was
such a splendid chance to go home without the bother of getting up to
the station he had just bundled his family and his valise on board and
was very sorry they did not have time to come up and bid us goodbye
The tent he left in charge of a very respectable man from whom he had
had supplies

That morning I had the campequipage packed up and expressed to its
owner We did not care to camp out any more that season but thought it
would be better to spend the rest of my vacation at the seashore

Our exboarder wrote to us that he and his wife were anxious that we
should return their visit during my holidays but as we did not see
exactly how we could return a visit of the kind we did not try to do
it



CHAPTER XII LORD EDWARD AND THE TREEMAN


It was winter at Rudder Grange The season was the same at other places
but that fact did not particularly interest Euphemia and myself It was
winter with us and we were ready for it That was the great point
and it made us proud to think that we had not been taken unawares
notwithstanding the many things that were to be thought of on a little
farm like ours

It is true that we had always been prepared for winter wherever we had
lived but this was a different case In other days it did not matter
much whether we were ready or not but now our house our cow our
poultry and indeed ourselves might have sufferedthere is no way
of finding out exactly how muchif we had not made all possible
preparations for the coming of cold weather

But there was a great deal yet to be thought of and planned out
although we were ready for winter The next thing to think of was
spring

We laid out the farm We decided where we would have wheat corn
potatoes and oats We would have a man by the day to sow and reap The
intermediate processes I thought I could attend to myself

Everything was talked over ciphered over and freely discussed by
my wife and myself except one matter which I planned and worked out
alone doing most of the necessary calculations at the office so as not
to excite Euphemias curiosity

I had determined to buy a horse This would be one of the most important
events of our married life and it demanded a great deal of thought
which I gave it

The horse was chosen for me by a friend He was an excellent beast the
horse excelling as my friend told me in muscle and wit Nothing
better than this could be said about a horse He was a sorrel animal
quite handsome gentle enough for Euphemia to drive and not too
highminded to do a little farmwork if necessary He was exactly the
animal I needed

The carriage was not quite such a success The horse having cost a good
deal more than I expected to pay I found that I could only afford a
secondhand carriage I bought a good serviceable vehicle which would
hold four persons if necessary and there was room enough to pack all
sorts of parcels and baskets It was with great satisfaction that
I contemplated this feature of the carriage which was a rather
rustylooking affair although sound and strong enough The harness was
new and set off the horse admirably

On the afternoon when my purchases were completed I did not come home
by the train I drove home in my own carriage drawn by my own horse
The ten miles drive was over a smooth road and the sorrel traveled
splendidly If I had been a line of kings a mile long all in their
chariots of state with gold and silver and outriders and music and
banners waving in the wind I could not have been prouder than when I
drew up in front of my house

There was a wagongate at one side of the front fence which had never
been used except by the men who brought coal and I got out and opened
this very quietly so as not to attract the attention of Euphemia It
was earlier than I usually returned and she would not be expecting
me I was then about to lead the horse up a somewhat grassgrown
carriageway to the front door but I reflected that Euphemia might be
looking out of some of the windows and I had better drive up So I got
in and drove very slowly to the door

However she heard the unaccustomed noise of wheels and looked out of
the parlor window She did not see me but immediately came around
to the door I hurried out of the carriage so quickly that not being
familiar with the steps I barely escaped tripping

When she opened the front door she was surprised to see me standing by
the horse

Have you hired a carriage she cried Are we going to ride

My dear said I as I took her by the hand we are going to ride But
I have not hired a carriage I have bought one Do you see this horse
He is oursour own horse

If you could have seen the face that was turned up to meall you other
men in the worldyou would have torn your hair in despair

Afterward she went around and around that horse she patted his smooth
sides she looked with admiration at his strong wellformed legs she
stroked his head she smoothed his mane she was brimful of joy

When I had brought the horse some water in a bucketand what a pleasure
it was to water ones own horseEuphemia rushed into the house and got
her hat and cloak and we took a little drive

I doubt if any horse ever drew two happier people Euphemia said but
little about the carriage That was a necessary adjunct and it was good
enough for the present But the horse How nobly and with what vigor
he pulled us up the hills and how carefully and strongly he held the
carriage back as we went down How easily he trotted over the level
road caring nothing for the ten miles he had gone that afternoon What
a sensation of power it gave us to think that all that strength and
speed and endurance was ours that it would go where we wished that it
would wait for us as long as we chose that it was at our service day
and night that it was a horse and we owned it

When we returned Pomona saw us drive inshe had not known of our
rideand when she heard the news she was as wild with proud delight as
anybody She wanted to unharness him but this I could not allow We did
not wish to be selfish but after she had seen and heard what we thought
was enough for her we were obliged to send her back to the kitchen for
the sake of the dinner

Then we unharnessed him I say we for Euphemia stood by and I explained
everything for some day she said she might want to do it herself
Then I led him into the stable How nobly he trod and how finely his
hoofs sounded on the stable floor

There was hay in the mow and I had brought a bag of oats under the seat
of the carriage

Isnt it just delightful said Euphemia that we havent any man
If we had a man he would take the horse at the door and we should be
deprived of all this It wouldnt be half like owning a horse

In the morning I drove down to the station Euphemia by my side She
drove back and Old John came up and attended to the horse This he was
to do for the present for a small stipend In the afternoon Euphemia
came down after me How I enjoyed those rides Before this I had thought
it ever so much more pleasant and healthful to walk to and from the
station than to ride but then I did not own a horse At night I
attended to everything Euphemia generally following me about the stable
with a lantern When the days grew longer we would have delightful rides
after dinner and even now we planned to have early breakfasts and go
to the station by the longest possible way

One day in the following spring I was riding home from the station
with Euphemiawe seldom took pleasuredrives now we were so busy
on the placeand as we reached the house I heard the dog barking
savagely He was loose in the little orchard by the side of the house
As I drove in Pomona came running to the carriage

Man up the tree she shouted

I helped Euphemia out left the horse standing by the door and ran to
the dog followed by my wife and Pomona Sure enough there was a man
up the tree and Lord Edward was doing his best to get at him springing
wildly at the tree and fairly shaking with rage

I looked up at the man he was a thoroughbred tramp burly dirty
generally unkempt but unlike most tramps he looked very much
frightened His position on a high crotch of an appletree was not
altogether comfortable and although for the present it was safe the
fellow seemed to have a wavering faith in the strength of appletree
branches and the moment he saw me he earnestly besought me to take
that dog away and let him down

I made no answer but turning to Pomona I asked her what this all
meant

Why sir you see said she I was in the kitchen bakin pies and
this fellow must have got over the fence at the side of the house for
the dog didnt see him and the first thing I knowd he was stickin his
head in the window and he asked me to give him somethin to eat And
when I said Id see in a minute if there was anything for him he says
to me Gim me a piece of one of them piespies Id just baked and
was settin to cool on the kitchen table No sir says I Im
not goin to cut one of them pies for you or any one like you All
right says he Ill come in and help myself He must have known
there was no man about and comin the way he did he hadnt seen the
dog So he come round to the kitchen door but I shot out before he got
there and unchained Lord Edward I guess he saw the dog when he got to
the door and at any rate he heard the chain clankin and he didnt go
in but just put for the gate But Lord Edward was after him so quick
that he hadnt no time to go to no gates It was all he could do to
scoot up this tree and if hed been a millionth part of a minute later
hed a been in another world by this time

The man who had not attempted to interrupt Pomonas speech now began
again to implore me to let him down while Euphemia looked pitifully at
him and was about I think to intercede with me in his favor but my
attention was drawn off from her by the strange conduct of the dog
Believing I suppose that he might leave the tramp for a moment now
that I had arrived he had dashed away to another tree where he was
barking furiously standing on his hind legs and clawing at the trunk

Whats the matter over there I asked

Oh thats the other fellow said Pomona Hes no harm And then
as the tramp made a movement as if he would try to come down and make
a rush for safety during the absence of the dog she called out Here
boy here boy and in an instant Lord Edward was again raging at his
post at the foot of the appletree

I was grievously puzzled at all this and walked over to the other tree
followed as before by Euphemia and Pomona

This one said the latter is a treeman

I should think so said I as I caught sight of a person in gray
trowsers standing among the branches of a cherrytree not very far from
the kitchen door The tree was not a large one and the branches were
not strong enough to allow him to sit down on them although they
supported him well enough as he stood close to the trunk just out of
reach of Lord Edward

This is a very unpleasant position sir said he when I reached
the tree I simply came into your yard on a matter of business and
finding that raging beast attacking a person in a tree I had barely
time to get up into this tree myself before he dashed at me Luckily
I was out of his reach but I very much fear I have lost some of my
property

No he hasnt said Pomona It was a big book he dropped I picked
it up and took it into the house Its full of pictures of pears and
peaches and flowers Ive been lookin at it Thats how I knew what he
was And there was no call for his gittin up a tree Lord Edward never
would have gone after him if he hadnt run as if he had guilt on his
soul

I suppose then said I addressing the individual in the cherrytree
that you came here to sell me some trees

Yes sir said he quickly trees shrubs vines
evergreenseverything suitable for a gentlemans country villa I
can sell you something quite remarkable sir in the way of
cherrytreesFrench ones just imported bear fruit three times
the size of anything that could be produced on a tree like this And
pearsfruit of the finest flavor and enormous size

Yes said Pomona I seen them in the book But they must grow on a
groundvine No tree couldnt hold such pears as them

Here Euphemia reproved Pomonas forwardness and I invited the
treeagent to get down out of the tree

Thank you said he but not while that dog is loose If you will
kindly chain him up I will get my book and show you specimens of some
of the finest small fruit in the world all imported from the first
nurseries of Europethe Redgold Amber Muscat grapethe

Oh please let him down said Euphemia her eyes beginning to sparkle

I slowly walked toward the tramptree revolving various matters in my
mind We had not spent much money on the place during the winter and
we now had a small sum which we intended to use for the advantage of the
farm but had not yet decided what to do with it It behooved me to be
careful

I told Pomona to run and get me the dogchain and I stood under the
tree listening as well as I could to the treeagent talking to
Euphemia and paying no attention to the impassioned entreaties of the
tramp in the crotch above me When the chain was brought I hooked one
end of it in Lord Edwards collar and then I took a firm grasp of the
other Telling Pomona to bring the treeagents book from the house I
called to that individual to get down from his tree He promptly obeyed
and taking the book from Pomona began to show the pictures to Euphemia

You had better hurry sir I called out I cant hold this dog very
long And indeed Lord Edward had made a run toward the agent which
jerked me very forcibly in his direction But a movement by the tramp
had quickly brought the dog back to his more desired victim

If you will just tie up that dog sir said the agent and come this
way I would like to show you the Meltinagua peardissolves in the
mouth like snow sir trees will bear next year

Oh come look at the Royal Sparkling Ruby grape cried Euphemia It
glows in the sun like a gem

Yes said the agent and fills the air with fragrance during the
whole month of September

I tell you I shouted I cant hold this dog another minute The
chain is cutting the skin off my hands Run sir run Im going to let
go

Run run cried Pomona Fly for your life

The agent now began to be frightened and shut up his book

If you only could see the plates sir Im sure

Are you ready I cried as the dog excited by Pomonas wild shouts
made a bolt in his direction

Goodday if I must said the agent as he hurried to the gate But
there he stopped

There is nothing sir he said that would so improve your place as
a row of the Spitzenberg Sweetscented Balsam fir along this fence Ill
sell you threeyearold trees

Hes loose I shouted as I dropped the chain

In a second the agent was on the other side of the gate Lord Edward
made a dash toward him but stopping suddenly flew back to the tree of
the tramp

If you should conclude sir said the treeagent looking over the
fence to have a row of those firs along here

My good sir said I there is no row of firs there now and the fence
is not very high My dog as you see is very much excited and I cannot
answer for the consequences if he takes it into his head to jump over

The treeagent turned and walked slowly away

Now lookahere cried the tramp from the tree in the voice of a
very illused person aint you goin to fasten up that dog and let me
git down

I walked up close to the tree and addressed him

No said I I am not When a man comes to my place bullies a young
girl who was about to relieve his hunger and then boldly determines
to enter my house and help himself to my property I dont propose to
fasten up any dog that may happen to be after him If I had another dog
Id let him loose and give this faithful beast a rest You can do as
you please You can come down and have it out with the dog or you can
stay up there until I have had my dinner Then I will drive down to the
village and bring up the constable and deliver you into his hands We
want no such fellows as you about

With that I unhooked the chain from Lord Edward and walked off to put
up the horse The man shouted after me but I paid no attention I did
not feel in a good humor with him

Euphemia was much disturbed by the various occurrences of the afternoon
She was sorry for the man in the tree she was sorry that the agent for
the Royal Ruby grape had been obliged to go away and I had a good deal
of trouble during dinner to make her see things in the proper light But
I succeeded at last

I did not hurry through dinner and when we had finished I went to my
work at the barn Tramps are not generally pressed for time and Pomona
had been told to give our captive something to eat

I was just locking the door of the carriagehouse when Pomona came
running to me to tell me that the tramp wanted to see me about something
very importantjust a minute he said I put the key in my pocket and
walked over to the tree It was now almost dark but I could see that
the dog the tramp and the tree still kept their respective places

Lookahere said the individual in the crotch you dont know how
dreadful oneasy these limbs gits after youve been settin up here
as long as I have And I dont want to have nuthin to do with no
constables Ill tell you what Ill do if youll chain up that dog and
let me go Ill fix things so that youll not be troubled no more by no
tramps

How will you do that I asked

Oh never you mind said he Ill give you my word of honor Ill do
it Theres a reglar understandin among us fellers you know

I considered the matter The word of honor of a fellow such as he was
could not be worth much but the merest chance of getting rid of
tramps should not be neglected I went in to talk to Euphemia about it
although I knew what she would say I reasoned with myself as much as
with her

If we put this one fellow in prison for a few weeks I said the
benefit is not very great If we are freed from all tramps for the
season the benefit is very great Shall we try for the greatest good

Certainly said Euphemia and his legs must be dreadfully stiff

So I went out and after a struggle of some minutes I chained Lord
Edward to a post at a little distance from the appletree When he was
secure the tramp descended nimbly from his perch notwithstanding his
stiff legs and hurried out of the gate He stopped to make no remarks
over the fence With a wild howl of disappointed ambition Lord Edward
threw himself after him But the chain held

A lane of moderate length led from our house to the main road and the
next day as we were riding home I noticed on the trunk of a large
tree which stood at the corner of the lane and road a curious mark I
drew up to see what it was but we could not make it out It was a very
rude device cut deeply into the tree and somewhat resembled a square
a circle a triangle and a cross with some smaller marks beneath it I
felt sure that our tramp had cut it and that it had some significance
which would be understood by the members of his fraternity

And it must have had for no tramps came near us all that summer We
were visited by a needy person now and then but by no member of the
regular army of tramps

One afternoon that fall I walked home and at the corner of the lane
I saw a tramp looking up at the mark on the tree which was still quite
distinct

What does that mean I said stepping up to him

How do I know said the man and what do you want to know fur

Just out of curiosity I said I have often noticed it I think
you can tell me what it means and if you will do so Ill give you a
dollar

And keep mum about it said the man

Yes I replied taking out the dollar

All right said the tramp That sign means that the man that lives up
this lane is a mean stingy cuss with a wicked dog and its no good to
go there

I handed him the dollar and went away perfectly satisfied with my
reputation

I wish here to make some mention of Euphemias methods of work in her
chickenyard She kept a book which she at first called her Fowl
Record but she afterward changed the name to Poultry Register I
never could thoroughly understand this book although she has often
explained every part of it to me She had pages for registering the age
description time of purchase or of birth and subsequent performances
of every fowl in her yard She had divisions of the book for expenses
profits probable losses and positive losses she noted the number of
eggs put under each setting hen the number of eggs cracked per day the
number spoiled and finally the number hatched Each chick on emerging
from its shell was registered and an account kept of its subsequent
life and adventures There were frequent calculations regarding the
advantages of various methods of treatment and there were statements of
the results of a great many experimentssomething like this Set Toppy
and her sister Pinky April 2nd 187 Toppy with twelve eggsthree
Brahma four common and five Leghorn Pinky with thirteen eggs as she
weighs four ounces more than her sister of which three were Leghorn
five common and five Brahma During the twentysecond and twentythird
of April same year Toppy hatched out four Brahmas two commons and
three Leghorns while her sister on these days and the morning of the
day following hatched two Leghorns six commons and only one Brahma
Now could Toppy who had only three Brahma eggs and hatched out four
of that breed have exchanged eggs with her sister thus making it
possible for her to hatch out six common chickens when she only had
five eggs of that kind Or did the eggs get mixed up in some way before
going into the possession of the hens Look into probabilities

These probabilities must have puzzled Euphemia a great deal but
they never disturbed her equanimity She was always as tranquil and
goodhumored about her poultryyard as if every hen laid an egg every
day and a henchick was hatched out of every egg

For it may be remembered that the principle underlying Euphemias
management of her poultry was what might be designated as the
cumulative hatch That is she wished every chicken hatched in her
yard to become the mother of a brood of her own during the year and
every one of this brood to raise another brood the next year and so on
in a kind of geometrical progression This plan called for a great many
motherfowls and so Euphemia based her highest hopes on a great annual
preponderance of hens

We ate a good many young roosters that fall for Euphemia would not
allow all the products of her yard to go to market and also a great
many eggs and fowls were sold She had not contented herself with her
original stock of poultry but had bought fowls during the winter and
she certainly had extraordinary good luck or else her extraordinary
system worked extraordinarily well



CHAPTER XIII POMONAS NOVEL


It was in the latter part of August of that year that it became
necessary for some one in the office in which I was engaged to go to St
Louis to attend to important business Everything seemed to point to me
as the fit person for I understood the particular business better than
any one else I felt that I ought to go but I did not altogether like
to do it I went home and Euphemia and I talked over the matter far
into the regulation sleepinghours

There were very good reasons why we should go for of course I would
not think of taking such a journey without Euphemia In the first
place it would be of advantage to me in my business connection to
take the trip and then it would be such a charming journey for us We
had never been west of the Alleghanies and nearly all the country we
would see would be new to us We would come home by the great lakes
and Niagara and the prospect was delightful to both of us But then
we would have to leave Rudder Grange for at least three weeks and how
could we do that

This was indeed a difficult question to answer Who could take care of
our garden our poultry our horse and cow and all their complicated
belongings The garden was in admirable condition Our vegetables
were coming in every day in just that fresh and satisfactory
conditionaltogether unknown to people who buy vegetablesfor which
I had labored so faithfully and about which I had had so many cheerful
anticipations As to Euphemias chickenyardwith Euphemia awaythe
subject was too great for us We did not even discuss it But we would
give up all the pleasures of our home for the chance of this most
desirable excursion if we could but think of some one who would come
and take care of the place while we were gone Rudder Grange could not
run itself for three weeks

We thought of every available person Old John would not do We did not
feel that we could trust him We thought of several of our friends
but there was in both our minds a certain shrinking from the idea of
handing over the place to any of them for such a length of time For my
part I said I would rather leave Pomona in charge than any one else
but then Pomona was young and a girl Euphemia agreed with me that she
would rather trust her than any one else but she also agreed in
regard to the disqualifications So when I went to the office the next
morning we had fully determined to go on the trip if we could find
some one to take charge of our place while we were gone When I returned
from the office in the afternoon I had agreed to go to St Louis By
this time I had no choice in the matter unless I wished to interfere
very much with my own interests We were to start in two days If in
that time we could get any one to stay at the place very well if not
Pomona must assume the charge We were not able to get any one and
Pomona did assume the charge It is surprising how greatly relieved we
felt when we were obliged to come to this conclusion The arrangement
was exactly what we wanted and now that there was no help for it our
consciences were easy

We felt sure that there would be no danger to Pomona Lord Edward would
be with her and she was a young person who was extraordinarily well
able to take care of herself Old John would be within call in case she
needed him and I borrowed a bulldog to be kept in the house at night
Pomona herself was more than satisfied with the plan

We made out the night before we left a long and minute series of
directions for her guidance in household garden and farm matters and
directed her to keep a careful record of everything note worthy that
might occur She was fully supplied with all the necessaries of life
and it has seldom happened that a young girl has been left in such a
responsible and independent position as that in which we left Pomona
She was very proud of it

Our journey was ten times more delightful than we had expected it would
be and successful in every way and yet although we enjoyed every hour
of the trip we were no sooner fairly on our way home than we became so
wildly anxious to get there that we reached Rudder Grange on Wednesday
whereas we had written that we would be home on Thursday We arrived
early in the afternoon and walked up from the station leaving our
baggage to be sent in the express wagon As we approached our dear home
we wanted to run we were so eager to see it

There it was the same as ever I lifted the gatelatch the gate was
locked We ran to the carriagegate that was locked too Just then I
noticed a placard on the fence it was not printed but the lettering
was large apparently made with ink and a brush It read


 TO BE SOLD

 For TAXES


We stood and looked at each other Euphemia turned pale

What does this mean said I Has our landlord

I could say no more The dreadful thought arose that the place might
pass away from us We were not yet ready to buy it But I did not put
the thought in words There was a field next to our lot and I got over
the fence and helped Euphemia over Then we climbed our sidefence This
was more difficult but we accomplished it without thinking much about
its difficulties our hearts were too full of painful apprehensions
I hurried to the front door it was locked All the lower windows
were shut We went around to the kitchen What surprised us more than
anything else was the absence of Lord Edward Had HE been sold

Before we reached the back part of the house Euphemia said she felt
faint and must sit down I led her to a tree near by under which I had
made a rustic chair The chair was gone She sat on the grass and I ran
to the pump for some water I looked for the bright tin dipper which
always hung by the pump It was not there But I had a travelingcup in
my pocket and as I was taking it out I looked around me There was an
air of bareness over everything I did not know what it all meant but
I know that my hand trembled as I took hold of the pumphandle and began
to pump

At the first sound of the pumphandle I heard a deep bark in the
direction of the barn and then furiously around the corner came Lord
Edward Before I had filled the cup he was bounding about me I believe
the glad welcome of the dog did more to revive Euphemia than the water
He was delighted to see us and in a moment up came Pomona running from
the barn Her face was radiant too We felt relieved Here were two
friends who looked as if they were neither sold nor ruined

Pomona quickly saw that we were ill at ease and before I could put a
question to her she divined the cause Her countenance fell

You know said she you said you wasnt comin till tomorrow If
you only HAD come thenI was goin to have everything just exactly
rightan now you had to climb in

And the poor girl looked as if she might cry which would have been a
wonderful thing for Pomona to do

Tell me one thing said I What aboutthose taxes

Oh thats all right she cried Dont think another minute about
that Ill tell you all about it soon But come in first and Ill get
you some lunch in a minute

We were somewhat relieved by Pomonas statement that it was all right
in regard to the taxposter but we were very anxious to know all
about the matter Pomona however gave us little chance to ask her any
questions As soon as she had made ready our lunch she asked us as a
particular favor to give her threequarters of an hour to herself
and then said she Ill have everything looking just as if it was
tomorrow

We respected her feelings for of course it was a great disappointment
to her to be taken thus unawares and we remained in the diningroom
until she appeared and announced that she was ready for us to go about
We availed ourselves quickly of the privilege and Euphemia hurried to
the chickenyard while I bent my steps toward the garden and barn As
I went out I noticed that the rustic chair was in its place and passing
the pump I looked for the dipper It was there I asked Pomona about the
chair but she did not answer as quickly as was her habit

Would you rather said she hear it all together when you come in
or have it in little bits head and tail all of a jumble

I called to Euphemia and asked her what she thought and she was so
anxious to get to her chickens that she said she would much rather wait
and hear it all together We found everything in perfect orderthe
garden was even free from weeds a thing I had not expected If it had
not been for that cloud on the front fence I should have been happy
enough Pomona had said it was all right but she could not have paid
the taxeshowever I would wait and I went to the barn

When Euphemia came in from the poultryyard she called me and said she
was in a hurry to hear Pomonas account of things So I went in and we
sat on the side porch where it was shady while Pomona producing some
sheets of foolscap paper took her seat on the upper step

I wrote down the things of any account what happened said she as
you told me to and while I was about it I thought Id make it like a
novel It would be jus as true and praps more amusin I suppose you
dont mind

No we didnt mind So she went on

I havent got no name for my novel I intended to think one out
tonight I wrote this all of nights And I dont read the first
chapters for they tell about my birth and my parentage and my early
adventures Ill just come down to what happened to me while you was
away because youll be more anxious to hear about that All thats
written here is true jus the same as if I told it to you but Ive put
it into novel language because it seems to come easier to me

And then in a voice somewhat different from her ordinary tones as if
the novel language demanded it she began to read

Chapter Five The Lonely house and the Faithful friend Thus was I left
alone None but two dogs to keep me company I milked the lowing kine
and watered and fed the steed and then after my frugal repast I
closed the mansion shutting out all recollections of the past and
also foresights into the future That night was a memorable one I
slept soundly until the break of morn but had the events transpired
which afterward occurred what would have happened to me no tongue
can tell Early the next day nothing happened Soon after breakfast
the venerable John came to borrow some kerosene oil and a half
a pound of sugar but his attempt was foiled I knew too well the
insidious foe In the very outset of his villiany I sent him
home with a empty can For two long days I wandered amid the verdant
pathways of the garden and to the barn whenever and anon my duty
called me nor did I ere neglect the fowlery No cloud oerspread
this happy period of my life But the cloud was rising in the horizon
although I saw it not

It was about twentyfive minutes after eleven on the morning of a
Thursday that I sat pondering in my mind the question what to do with
the butter and the vegetables Here was butter and here was green
corn and limabeans and trophy tomats far more than I ere could use
And here was a horse idly cropping the foliage in the field for as
my employer had advised and ordered I had put the steed to grass And
here was a wagon none too new which had it the top taken off or even
the curtains rolled up would do for a licenced vender With the
truck and butter and mayhap some milk I could load that wagon

O Pomona interrupted Euphemia You dont mean to say that you were
thinking of doing anything like that

Well I was just beginning to think of it said Pomona but of course
I couldnt have gone away and left the house And youll see I didnt do
it And then she continued her novel But while my thoughts were thus
employed I heard Lord Edward burst into barkter

At this Euphemia and I could not help bursting into laughter Pomona did
not seem at all confused but went on with her reading

I hurried to the door and looking out I saw a wagon at the gate
Repairing there I saw a man Said he Wilt open this gate I had
fastened up the gates and removed every stealable article from the
yard

Euphemia and I looked at each other This explained the absence of the
rustic seat and the dipper

Thus with my mind at ease I could let my faithful friend the dog
for he it was roam with me through the grounds while the fierce
bulldog guarded the mansion within Then said I quite bold unto
him No I let in no man here My employer and employeress are now
from home What do you want Then says he as bold as brass Ive
come to put the lightening rods upon the house Open the gate What
rods says I The rods as was ordered says he open the gate I
stood and gazed at him Full well I saw through his pinchbeck mask I
knew his tricks In the absence of my employer he would put up rods
and ever so many more than was wanted and likely too some miserable
trash that would attrack the lightening instead of keeping it off
Then as it would spoil the house to take them down they would be kept
and pay demanded No sir says I No lightening rods upon this
house whilst I stand here and with that I walked away and let Lord
Edward loose The man he stormed with passion His eyes flashed
fire He would een have scaled the gate but when he saw the dog he
did forbear As it was then near noon I strode away to feed the fowls
but when I did return I saw a sight which froze the blood within my
veins

The dog didnt kill him cried Euphemia

Oh no maam said Pomona Youll see that that wasnt it At one
corner of the lot in front a base boy who had accompanied this
man was banging on the fence with a long stick and thus attracking
to hisself the rage of Lord Edward while the vile intriger of a
lightening rodder had brought a ladder to the other side of the
house up which he had now ascended and was on the roof What horrors
filled my soul How my form trembled This continued Pomona is the
end of the novel and she laid her foolscap pages on the porch

Euphemia and I exclaimed with one voice against this We had just
reached the most exciting part and I added we had heard nothing yet
about that affair of the taxes

You see sir said Pomona it took me so long to write out the
chapters about my birth my parentage and my early adventures that
I hadnt time to finish up the rest But I can tell you what happened
after that jus as well as if I had writ it out And so she went on
much more glibly than before with the account of the doings of the
lightningrod man

There was that wretch on top of the house afixin his old rods and
hammerin away for dear life Hed brought his ladder over the side
fence where the dog abarkin and plungin at the boy outside
couldnt see him I stood dumb for a minute an then I knowd I had
him I rushed into the house got a piece of wellrope tied it to the
bulldogs collar an dragged him out and fastened him to the bottom
rung of the ladder Then I walks over to the front fence with Lord
Edwards chain for I knew that if he got at that bulldog thered be
times for theyd never been allowed to see each other yet So says I to
the boy Im goin to tie up the dog so you neednt be afraid of his
jumpin over the fencewhich he couldnt do or the boy would have
been a corpse for twenty minutes or may be half an hour The boy kinder
laughed and said I neednt mind which I didnt Then I went to the
gate and I clicked to the horse which was standin there an off
he starts as good as gold an trots down the road The boy he said
somethin or other pretty bad an away he goes after him but the horse
was atrottin real fast an had a good start

How on earth could you ever think of doing such things said
Euphemia That horse might have upset the wagon and broken all the
lightningrods besides running over I dont know how many people

But you see maam that wasnt my lookout said Pomona I was
adefendin the house and the enemy must expect to have things happen
to him So then I hears an awful row on the roof and there was the man
just coming down the ladder Hed heard the horse go off and when
he got about halfway down an caught a sight of the bulldog he was
madder than ever you seed a lightninrodder in all your born days
Take that dog off of there he yelled at me No I wont says I I
never see a girl like you since I was born he screams at me I guess
it would a been better fur you if you had says I an then he was
so mad he couldnt stand it any longer and he comes down as low as he
could and when he saw just how long the rope waswhich was pretty
shorthe made a jump and landed clear of the dog Then he went on
dreadful because he couldnt get at his ladder to take it away and I
wouldnt untie the dog because if I had hed a torn the tendons out
of that fellows legs in no time I never see a dog in such a boiling
passion and yet never making no sound at all but bloodcurdlin grunts
An I dont see how the rodder would a got his ladder at all if the
dog hadnt made an awful jump at him and jerked the ladder down It
just missed your geraniumbed and the rodder he ran to the other end
of it and began pullin it away dog an all Lookahere says I
we can fix him now and so he cooled down enough to help me and I
unlocked the front door and we pushed the bottom end of the ladder
in dog and all an then I shut the door as tight as it would go an
untied the end of the rope an the rodder pulled the ladder out while I
held the door to keep the dog from follerin which he came pretty near
doin anyway But I locked him in and then the man began stormin
again about his wagon but when he looked out an see the boy comin
back with itfor somebody must a stopped the horsehe stopped
stormin and went to put up his ladder agin No you dont says I
Ill let the big dog loose next time and if I put him at the foot of
your ladder youll never come down But I want to go and take down
what I put up he says I aint agoin on with this job No says
I you aint and you cant go up there to wrench off them rods and make
rainholes in the roof neither He couldnt get no madder than he was
then an fur a minute or two he couldnt speak an then he says Ill
have satisfaction for this An says I How An says he Youll see
what it is to interfere with a ordered job An says I There wasnt
no order about it an says he Ill show you better than that an
he goes to his wagon an gits a book There says he read that
What of it says I theres nobody of the name of Ball lives here
That took the man kinder aback and he said he was told it was the only
house on the lane which I said was right only it was the next lane he
oughter a gone to He said no more after that but just put his ladder
in his wagon and went off But I was not altogether rid of him He left
a trail of his baleful presence behind him

That horrid bulldog wouldnt let me come into the house No matter
what door I tried there he was just foamin mad I let him stay till
nearly night and then went and spoke kind to him but it was no good
Hed got an awful spite agin me I found something to eat down cellar
and I made a fire outside an roasted some corn and potatoes That night
I slep in the barn I wasnt afraid to be away from the house for I
knew it was safe enough with that dog in it and Lord Edward outside
For three days Sunday an all I was kep out of this here house I got
along pretty well with the sleepin and the eatin but the drinkin
was the worst I couldnt get no coffee or tea but there was plenty of
milk

Why didnt you get some man to come and attend to the dog I asked
It was dreadful to live that way

Well I didnt know no man that could do it said Pomona The dog
would a been too much for Old John and besides he was mad about the
kerosene Sunday afternoon Captain Atkinson and Mrs Atkinson and their
little girl in a pushwagon come here and I told em you was gone
away but they says they would stop a minute and could I give them a
drink an I had nothin to give it to them but an old chickenbowl that
I had washed out for even the dipper was in the house an I told em
everything was locked up which was true enough though they must a
thought you was a queer kind of people but I wasnt agoin to say
nothin about the dog fur to tell the truth I was ashamed to do it
So as soon as theyd gone I went down into the cellarand its lucky
that I had the key for the outside cellar doorand I got a piece of
fat cornbeef and the meataxe I unlocked the kitchen door and went in
with the axe in one hand and the meat in the other The dog might take
his choice I knowd he must be pretty nigh famished for there was
nothin that he could get at to eat As soon as I went in he came
runnin to me but I could see he was shaky on his legs He looked a
sort of wicked at me and then he grabbed the meat He was all right
then

Oh my said Euphemia I am so glad to hear that I was afraid you
never got in But we saw the dogis he as savage yet

Oh no said Pomona nothin like it

Look here Pomona said I I want to know about those taxes When do
they come into your story

Pretty soon sir said she and she went on

After that I knowd it wouldnt do to have them two dogs so that
theyd have to be tied up if they see each other Just as like as not
Id want them both at once and then theyd go to fightin and leave me
to settle with some bloodthirsty lightninrodder So as I knowd if
they once had a fair fight and found out which was master theyd be
good friends afterwards I thought the best thing to do would be to let
em fight it out when there was nothin else for em to do So I fixed
up things for the combat

Why Pomona cried Euphemia I didnt think you were capable of such
a cruel thing

It looks that way maam but really it aint replied the girl It
seemed to me as if it would be a mercy to both of em to have the
thing settled So I cleared away a place in front of the woodshed and
unchained Lord Edward and then I opened the kitchen door and called the
bull Out he came with his teeth ashowin and his bloodshot eyes
and his crooked front legs Like lightnin from the mountin blast he
made one bounce for the big dog and oh what a fight there was They
rolled they gnashed they knocked over the woodhorse and sent chips
aflyin all ways at wonst I thought Lord Edward would whip in a minute
or two but he didnt for the bull stuck to him like a burr and they
was havin it ground and lofty when I hears some one run up behind me
and turnin quick there was the Piscopalian minister My my my
he hollers what a awful spectacle Aint there no way of stoppin it
No sir says I and I told him how I didnt want to stop it and the
reason why Then says he Wheres your master and I told him how you
was away Isnt there any man at all about says he No says
I Then says he if theres nobody else to stop it I must do it
myself An he took off his coat No says I you keep back sir If
theres anybody to plunge into that erena the blood be mine an I
put my hand without thinkin agin his black shirtbosom to hold him
back but he didnt notice bein so excited Now says I jist wait
one minute and youll see that bulls tail go between his legs Hes
weakenin An sure enough Lord Edward got a good grab at him and was
ashakin the very life out of him when I run up and took Lord Edward
by the collar Drop it says I and he dropped it for he knowd hed
whipped and he was pretty tired hisself Then the bulldog he trotted
off with his tail ahangin down Now then says I them dogs will
be bosom friends forever after this Ah me says he Im sorry
indeed that your employer for who Ive always had a great respect
should allow you to get into such habits That made me feel real bad
and I told him mighty quick that you was the last man in the world to
let me do anything like that and that if youd a been here youd
a separated them dogs if theyd achawed your arms off that you was
very particular about such things and that it would be a pity if he was
to think you was a dogfightin gentleman when Id often heard you say
that now you was fixed an settled the one thing you would like most
would be to be made a vestryman

I sat up straight in my chair

Pomona I exclaimed you didnt tell him that

Thats what I said sir for I wanted him to know what you really was
an he says Well well I never knew that It might be a very good
thing Ill speak to some of the members about it Theres two vacancies
now in our vestry

I was crushed but Euphemia tried to put the matter into the brightest
light

Perhaps it may all turn out for the best she said and you may be
elected and that would be splendid But it would be an awfully funny
thing for a dogfight to make you a vestryman

I could not talk on this subject Go on Pomona I said trying to
feel resigned to my shame and tell us about that poster on the fence

Ill be to that almost right away she said It was two or three days
after the dogfight that I was down at the barn and happenin to look
over to Old Johns I saw that treeman there He was ashowin his
book to John and him and his wife and all the young ones was astandin
there drinkin down them big peaches and pears as if they was all real
I knowd hed come here agin for them fellers never gives you up and
I didnt know how to keep him away for I didnt want to let the dogs
loose on a man what after all didnt want to do no more harm than to
talk the life out of you So I just happened to notice as I came to the
house how kind of desolate everything looked and I thought perhaps
I might make it look worse and he wouldnt care to deal here So I
thought of puttin up a poster like that for nobody whose place was
agoin to be sold for taxes would be likely to want trees So I run in
the house and wrote it quick and put it up And sure enough the man he
come along soon and when he looked at that paper and tried the gate
an looked over the fence an saw the house all shut up an not a livin
soul aboutfor I had both the dogs in the house with mehe shook his
head an walked off as much as to say If that man had fixed his place
up proper with my trees he wouldnt a come to this An then as I
found the poster worked so good I thought it might keep other people
from comin abotherin around and so I left it up but I was agoin
to be sure and take it down before you came

As it was now pretty late in the afternoon I proposed that Pomona
should postpone the rest of her narrative until evening She said that
there was nothing else to tell that was very particular and I did not
feel as if I could stand anything more just now even if it was very
particular

When we were alone I said to Euphemia

If we ever have to go away from this place again

But we wont go away she interrupted looking up to me with as bright
a face as she ever had at least not for a long long long time to
come And Im so glad youre to be a vestryman



CHAPTER XIV POMONA TAKES A BRIDAL TRIP


Our life at Rudder Grange seemed to be in no way materially changed by
my becoming a vestryman The cow gave about as much milk as before and
the hens laid the usual number of eggs Euphemia went to church with a
little more of an air perhaps but as the wardens were never absent
and I was never therefore called upon to assist in taking up the
collection her sense of my position was not inordinately manifested

For a year or two indeed there was no radical change in anything about
Rudder Grange except in Pomona In her there was a change She grew up

She performed this feat quite suddenly She was a young girl when she
first came to us and we had never considered her as anything else when
one evening she had a young man to see her Then we knew she had grown
up

We made no objections to her visitorsshe had several from time to
timefor said Euphemia suppose my parents had objected to your
visits I could not consider the mere possibility of anything like
this and we gave Pomona all the ordinary opportunities for entertaining
her visitors To tell the truth I think we gave her more than the
ordinary opportunities I know that Euphemia would wait on herself to
almost any extent rather than call upon Pomona when the latter was
entertaining an evening visitor in the kitchen or on the back porch

Suppose my mother she once remarked in answer to a mild remonstrance
from me in regard to a circumstance of this naturesuppose my mother
had rushed into our presence when we were plighting our vows and had
told me to go down into the cellar and crack ice

It was of no use to talk to Euphemia on such subjects she always had an
answer ready

You dont want Pomona to go off and be married do you I asked one
day as she was putting up some new muslin curtains in the kitchen You
seem to be helping her to do this all you can and yet I dont know
where on earth you will get another girl who will suit you so well

I dont know either replied Euphemia with a tack in her mouth and
Im sure I dont want her to go But neither do I want winter to come
or to have to wear spectacles but I suppose both of these things will
happen whether I like it or not

For some time after this Pomona had very little company and we began to
think that there was no danger of any present matrimonial engagement on
her parta thought which was very gratifying to us although we
did not wish in any way to interfere with her prospectswhen one
afternoon she quietly went up into the village and was married

Her husband was a tall young fellow a son of a farmer in the county
who had occasionally been to see her but whom she must have frequently
met on her afternoons out

When Pomona came home and told us this news we were certainly well
surprised

What on earth are we to do for a girl cried Euphemia

Youre to have me till you can get another one said Pomona quietly
I hope you dont think Id go way and leave you without anybody

But a wife ought to go to her husband said Euphemia especially so
recent a bride Why didnt you let me know all about it I would have
helped to fit you out We would have given you the nicest kind of a
little wedding

I know that said Pomona youre jus good enough But I didnt want
to put you to all that troubleright in preservingtime too An he
wanted it quiet for hes awful backward about shows An as Im to
go to live with his folksat least in a little house on the farmI
might as well stay here as anywhere even if I didnt want to for I
cant go there till after frost

Why not I asked

The chills and fever said she They have it awful down in that
valley Why he had a chill while we was bein married right at the
bridal altar

You dont say so exclaimed Euphemia How dreadful

Yes indeed said Pomona He must a forgot it was his chillday
and he didnt take his quinine and so it come on him jus as he was
apromisin to love an pertect But he stuck it out at the ministers
house and walked home by hisself to finish his chill

And you didnt go with him cried Euphemia indignantly

He said no It was better thus He felt it werent the right thing
to mingle the agur with his marriage vows He promised to take sixteen
grains tomorrow and so I came away Hell be all right in a month or
so an then well go an keep house You see it aint likely I could
help him any by goin there an gettin it myself

Pomona said Euphemia this is dreadful You ought to go and take a
bridal tour and get him rid of those fearful chills

I never thought of that said Pomona her face lighting up
wonderfully

Now that Euphemia had fallen upon this happy idea she never dropped
it until she had made all the necessary plans and had put them into
execution In the course of a week she had engaged another servant and
had started Pomona and her husband off on a bridaltour stipulating
nothing but that they should take plenty of quinine in their trunk

It was about three weeks after this and Euphemia and I were sitting on
our front stepsI had come home early and we had been potting some
of the tenderest plantswhen Pomona walked in at the gate She looked
well and had on a very bright new dress Euphemia noticed this the
moment she came in We welcomed her warmly for we felt a great interest
in this girl who had grown up in our family and under our care

Have you had your bridal trip asked Euphemia

Oh yes said Pomona Its all over an done with an were settled
in our house

Well sit right down here on the steps and tell us all about it said
Euphemia in a glow of delightful expectancy and Pomona nothing loth
sat down and told her tale

You see said she untying her bonnet strings to give an easier
movement to her chin we didnt say where we was goin when we started
out for the truth was we didnt know We couldnt afford to take no big
trip and yet we wanted to do the thing up jus as right as we could
seein as you had set your heart on it an as we had too for that
matter Niagery Fall was what I wanted but he said that it cost so much
to see the sights there that he hadnt money to spare to take us there
an pay for all the sightseein too We might go he said without
seein the sights or if there was any way of seein the sights without
goin that might do but he couldnt do both So we give that up and
after thinkin a good deal we agreed to go to some other falls which
might come cheaper an maybe be jus as good to begin on So we
thought of Passaic Falls up to Paterson an we went there an took a
room at a little hotel an walked over to the falls But they wasnt
no good after all for there wasnt no water runnin over em There
was rocks and precipicers an direful depths and everything for a good
falls except water and that was all bein used at the mills Well
Miguel says I this is about as nice a place for a falls as ever I
see but

Miguel cried Euphemia Is that your husbands name

Well no said Pomona it isnt His given name is Jonas but I hated
to call him Jonas an on a bridal trip too He might jus as well have
had a more romanticer name if his parents had a thought of it So
I determined Id give him a better one while we was on our journey
anyhow an I changed his name to Miguel which was the name of a
Spanish count He wanted me to call him Jiguel because he said that
would have a kind of a floating smell of his old name but I didnt
never do it Well neither of us didnt care to stay about no dry falls
so we went back to the hotel and got our supper and begun to wonder
what we should do next day He said wed better put it off and dream
about it and make up our minds nex mornin which I agreed to an
that evenin as we was sittin in our room I asked Miguel to tell me
the story of his life He said at first it hadnt none but when I
seemed a kinder put out at this he told me I mustnt mind an he would
reveal the whole So he told me this story

My grandfather said he was a rich and powerful Portugee alivin
on the island of Jamaica He had heaps o slaves an owned a black
brigantine that he sailed in on secret voyages an when he come
back the decks an the gunnels was often bloody but nobody knew why or
wherefore He was a big man with black hair an very violent He could
never have kept no help if he hadnt owned em but he was so rich
that people respected him in spite of all his crimes My grandmother
was a native o the Isle o Wight She was a frail an tender woman
with yeller hair and deep blue eyes an gentle an soft an good to
the poor She used to take baskits of vittles aroun to sick folks an
set down on the side o their beds an read The Shepherd o Salisbury
Plains to em She hardly ever speaked above her breath an always
wore white gowns with a silk kerchief afolded placidly aroun her
neck Them was awful different kind o people I says to him I
wonder how they ever come to be married They never was married says
he Never married I hollers ajumpin up from my chair and you sit
there carmly an look me in the eye Yes says he they was never
married They never met one was my mothers father and the other one
my fathers mother Twas well they did not wed I should think so
said I an now whats the good of tellin me a thing like that

Its about as near the mark as most of the stories of peoples lives
I reckon says he an besides Id only jus begun it

Well I dont want no more says I an I jus tell this story of his
to show what kind of stories he told about that time He said they was
pleasant fictions but I told him that if he didnt look out hed hear
em called by a good deal of a worse kind of a name than that The nex
mornin he asked me what was my dream an I told him I didnt have
exactly no dream about it but my idea was to have somethin real
romantic for the rest of our bridal days

Well says he what would you like I had a dream but it wasnt no
ways romantic and Ill jus fall in with whatever youd like best

All right says I an the most romanticest thing that I can
think of is for us to makebelieve for the rest of this trip We can
makebelieve were anything we please an if we think so in real
earnest it will be pretty much the same thing as if we really was We
aint likely to have no chance agin of being jus what weve a mind to
an so lets try it now

What would you have a mind to be says he

Well says I lets be an earl an a earless

Earless says he theres no such a person

Why yes there is of course I says to him Whats a sheearl if
she isnt a earless

Well I dont know says he never havin lived with any of em but
well let it go at that An how do you want to work the thing out

This way says I You Miguel

Jiguel says he

The earl says I not mindin his interruption an me your noble
earless will go to some good place or otherit dont matter much jus
where and whatever house we live in well call our castle an well
consider its got drawbridges an portcullises an moats an secrit
dungeons an well remember our noble ancesters an behave accordin
An the people we meet we can make into counts and dukes and princes
without their knowin anything about it an we can think our clothes is
silk an satin an velwet all covered with dimuns an precious stones
jus as well as not

Jus as well says he

An then I went on we can go an have chiVALrous adventuresor
make believe were havin eman build up a atmosphere of
romanticness aroun us thatll carry us back

To ole Virginny says he

No says I for thousands of years or at least enough back for the
times of tournaments and chiVALry

An so your idea is that we make believe all these things an dont
pay for none of em is it says he

Yes says I an you Miguel

Jiguel says he

Can ask me if you dont know what chiVALric or romantic thing you
ought to do or to say so as to feel yourself truly an reely a earl for
Ive read a lot about these people an know jus what ought to be did

Well he set himself down an thought a while an then he says All
right Well do that an well begin tomorrow mornin for Ive got
a little business to do in the city which wouldnt be exactly the right
thing for me to stoop to after Im a earl so Ill go in an do it while
Im a common person an come back this afternoon an you can walk about
an look at the dry falls an amuse yourself genrally till I come
back

All right says I an off he goes

He come back afore dark an the nex mornin we got ready to start
off

Have you any particular place to go says he

No says I one place is as likely to be as good as another for our
style o thing If it dont suit we can imagine it does

Thatll do says he an we had our trunk sent to the station and
walked ourselves When we got there he says to me

Which number will you have five or seven

Either one will suit me Earl Miguel says I

Jiguel says he an well make it seven An now Ill go an look
at the timetable an well buy tickets for the seventh station from
here The seventh station says he comin back is Pokus Well go to
Pokus

So when the train come we got in an got out at Pokus It was a pretty
sort of a place out in the country with the houses scattered a long
ways apart like stingy chickenfeed

Lets walk down this road says he till we come to a good house for
a castle an then we can ask em to take us to board an if they wont
do it well go to the next an so on

All right says I glad enough to see how pat he entered into the
thing

We walked a good ways an passed some little houses that neither of us
thought would do without more imaginin than would pay till we came to
a pretty big house near the river which struck our fancy in a minute
It was a stone house an it had trees aroun it there was a garden
with a wall an things seemed to suit firstrate so we made up our
minds right off that wed try this place

You wait here under this tree says he an Ill go an ask em if
theyll take us to board for a while

So I waits an he goes up to the gate an pretty soon he comes out
an says All right theyll take us an theyll send a man with a
wheelbarrer to the station for our trunk So in we goes The man was
a countrylike lookin man an his wife was a very pleasant woman The
house wasnt furnished very fine but we didnt care for that an
they gave us a big room that had rafters instid of a ceilin an a big
fireplace an that I said was jus exacly what we wanted The room
was almos like a donjon itself which he said he reckoned had once
been a kitchin but I told him that a earl hadnt nothin to do with
kitchins an that this was a tapestry chamber an Id tell him all
about the strange figgers on the embroidered hangins when the shadders
begun to fall

It rained a little that afternoon an we stayed in our room an hung
our clothes an things about on nails an hooks an made believe
they was armor an ancient trophies an portraits of a long line of
ancesters I did most of the makebelievin but he agreed to evrything
The man who kep the houses wife brought us our supper about dark
because she said she thought we might like to have it together cozy an
so we did an was glad enough of it an after supper we sat before the
fireplace where we madebelieve the flames was aroarin an cracklin
an alightin up the bright places on the armor ahangin aroun while
the stormwhich we madebelievewas aragin an whirlin outside I
told him a long story about a lord an a lady which was two or three
stories I had read run together an we had a splendid time It all
seemed real real to me



CHAPTER XV IN WHICH TWO NEW FRIENDS DISPORT THEMSELVES


The nex mornin was fine an nice continued Pomona an after our
breakfast had been brought to us we went out in the grounds to take a
walk There was lots of trees back of the house with walks among em
an altogether it was so oletimey an castleish that I was as happy as
a lark

Come along Earl Miguel I says let us tread a measure neath these
mantlin trees

All right says he Your Jiguel attends you An what might our
noble second name be What is we earl an earless of

Oh anything says I Lets take any name at random

All right says he Let it be random Earl an Earless Random Come
along

So we walks about I feelin mighty noble an springy an afore long
we sees another couple awalkin about under the trees

Whos them says I

Dont know says he but I expect theyre some o the other
boarders The man said he had other boarders when I spoke to him about
takin us

Lets makebelieve theyre a count an count says I Count an
Countess of

Milwaukee says he

I didnt think much of this for a noble name but still it would do
well enough an so we called em the Count an Countess of Milwaukee
an we kep on a meanderin Pretty soon he gets tired an says he was
agoin back to the house to have a smoke because he thought it was time
to have a little fun which werent all imaginations an I says to him
to go along but it would be the hardest thing in this world for me to
imagine any fun in smokin He laughed an went back while I walked on
amakinbelieve a page in blue puffed breeches was aholdin up my
train which was of lightgreen velvet trimmed with silver lace
Pretty soon turnin a little corner I meets the Count and Countess of
Milwaukee She was a small lady dressed in black an he was a big fat
man about fifty years old with a grayish beard They both wore little
straw hats exacly alike an had on green carpetslippers

They stops when they sees me an the lady she bows and says
goodmornin an then she smiles very pleasant an asks if I was
alivin here an when I said I was she says she was too for the
present an what was my name I had half a mind to say the Earless
Random but she was so pleasant and sociable that I didnt like to seem
to be makin fun an so I said I was Mrs De Henderson

An I says she am Mrs General Andrew Jackson widow of the
exPresident of the United States I am staying here on business
connected with the United States Bank This is my brother says she
pointin to the big man

How dye do says he aputtin his hands together turnin his toes
out an makin a funny little bow I am General Tom Thumb he says
in a deep gruff voice an Ive been before all the crowned heads of
Europe Asia Africa America an Australiaall as but onean Im
waitin here for a team of four little milkwhite oxen no bigger than
tall cats which is to be hitched to a little haywagon which I am to
ride in with a little pitchfork an real farmers clothes only
small This will come tomorrow when I will pay for it an ride away to
exhibit It may be here now an I will go an see Goodbye

Goodbye likewise says the lady I hope youll have all youre
thinkin youre havin an more too but less if youd like it
Farewell An away they goes

Well you may be sure I stood there amazed enough an mad too when I
heard her talk about my bein all I was athinkin I was I was sure my
husbandscarce two weeks old a husbandhad told all It was too bad
I wished I had jus said I was the Earless of Random an brassed it
out

I rushed back an foun him smokin a pipe on a back porch I charged
him with his perfidy but he vowed so earnest that he had not told these
people of our fancies or ever had spoke to em that I had to believe
him

I expec says he that theyre jus makinbelieveas we are
There aint no patent on makebelieves

This didnt satisfy me an as he seemed to be so careless about it I
walked away an left him to his pipe I determined to go take a walk
along some of the country roads an think this thing over for myself
I went aroun to the front gate where the woman of the house was
astandin talkin to somebody an I jus bowed to her for I didnt
feel like sayin anything an walked past her

Hello said she jumpin in front of me an shuttin the gate
You cant go out here If you want to walk you can walk about in the
grounds Theres lots of shady paths

Cant go out says I Cant go out What do you mean by that

I mean jus what I say said she an she locked the gate

I was so mad that I could have pushed her over an broke the gate but
I thought that if there was anything of that kind to do I had a husband
whose business it was to attend to it an so I runs aroun to him to
tell him He had gone in but I met Mrs Jackson an her brother

Whats the matter said she seein what a hurry I was in

That woman at the gate I said almost chokin as I spoke wont let
me out

She wont said Mrs Jackson Well thats a way she has Four times
the Bank of the United States has closed its doors before I was able to
get there on account of that womans obstinacy about the gate Indeed
I have not been to the Bank at all yet for of course it is of no use to
go after banking hours

An I believe too said her brother in his heavy voice that she
has kept out my team of little oxen Otherwise it would be here now

I couldnt stand any more of this an ran into our room where my
husband was When I told him what had happened he was real sorry

I didnt know you thought of going out he said or I would have
told you all about it An now sit down an quiet yourself an Ill
tell you jus how things is So down we sits an says he jus as
carm as a summer cloud My dear this is a lunertic asylum Now dont
jump he says I didnt bring you here because I thought you was
crazy but because I wanted you to see what kind of people they was who
imagined themselves earls and earlesses an all that sort o thing
an to have an idea how the thing worked after youd been doing it a
good while an had got used to it I thought it would be a good thing
while I was Earl Jiguel and you was a noble earless to come to a place
where people acted that way I knowed you had read lots o books about
knights and princes an bloody towers an that you knowed all about
them things but I didnt suppose you did know how them same things
looked in these days an a lunertic asylum was the only place where
you could see em So I went to a doctor I knowed he says an got
a certificate from him to this private institution where we could stay
for a while an get posted on romantics

Then says I the upshot was that you wanted to teach a lesson

Jus that says he

All right says I its teached An now lets get out of this as
quick as we kin

Thatll suit me he says an well leave by the noon train Ill go
an see about the trunk bein sent down

So off he went to see the man who kept the house while I falls to
packin up the trunk as fast as I could

Werent you dreadfully angry at him asked Euphemia who having a
romantic streak in her own composition did not sympathize altogether
with this heroic remedy for Pomonas disease

No maam said Pomona not long When I thought of Mrs General
Jackson and Tom Thumb I couldnt help thinkin that I must have looked
pretty much the same to my husband who I knowed now had only been
makinbelieve to makebelieve An besides I couldnt be angry very
long for laughin for when he come back in a minute as mad as a March
hare an said they wouldnt let me out nor him nuther I fell to
laughin ready to crack my sides

They say said he as soon as he could speak straight that we cant
go out without another certificate from the doctor I told em Id go
myself an see him about it but they said no I couldnt for if they
did that way everybody who ever was sent here would be goin out the
next day to see about leavin I didnt want to make no fuss so I told
them Id write a letter to the doctor and tell him to send an order
that would soon show them whether we could go out or not They said
that would be the best thing to do an so Im goin to write it this
minutewhich he did

How long will we have to wait says I when the letter was done

Well says he the doctor cant get this before tomorrow mornin
an even if he answers right away we wont get our order to go out
until the next day So well jus have to grin an bear it for a day an
a half

This is a lively old bridaltrip said Idry falls an a lunertic
asylum

Well try to make the rest of it better said he

But the next day wasnt no better We staid in our room all day for we
didnt care to meet Mrs Jackson an her crazy brother an Im sure we
didnt want to see the mean creatures who kept the house We knew well
enough that they only wanted us to stay so that they could get more
boardmoney out of us

I should have broken out cried Euphemia I would never have staid
an hour in that place after I found out what it was especially on a
bridal trip

If wed done that said Pomona theyd have got men after us an
then everybody would have thought we was real crazy We made up our
minds to wait for the doctors letter but it wasnt much fun An I
didnt tell no romantic stories to fill up the time We sat down an
behaved like the commonest kind o people You never saw anybody sicker
of romantics than I was when I thought of them two loons that called
themselves Mrs Andrew Jackson and General Tom Thumb I dropped Miguel
altogether an he dropped Jiguel which was a relief to me an I took
strong to Jonas even callin him Jone which I consider a good deal
uglier an commoner even than Jonas He didnt like this much but said
that if it would help me out of the Miguel he didnt care

Well on the mornin of the next day I went into the little front room
that they called the office to see if there was a letter for us yet
an there wasnt nobody there to ask But I saw a pile of letters under
a weight on the table an I jus looked at these to see if one of em
was for us an if there wasnt the very letter Jone had written to the
doctor Theyd never sent it I rushes back to Jone an tells him an
he jus set an looked at me without sayin a word I didnt wonder he
couldnt speak

Ill go an let them people know what I think of em says I

Dont do that said Jone catchin me by the sleeve It wont do no
good Leave the letter there an dont say nothin about it Well stay
here till afternoon quite quiet an then well go away That garden
wall isnt high

An how about the trunk says I

Oh well take a few things in our pockets an lock up the trunk an
ask the doctor to send for it when we get to the city

All right says I An we went to work to get ready to leave

About five oclock in the afternoon when it was a nice time to take a
walk under the trees we meandered quietly down to a corner of the back
wall where Jone thought it would be rather convenient to get over He
hunted up a short piece of board which he leaned up agin the wall an
then he put his foot on the top of that an got hold of the top of the
wall an climbed up as easy as nuthin Then he reached down to help me
step onto the board But jus as he was agoin to take me by the hand
Hello says he Look athere An I turned round an looked an if
there wasnt Mrs Andrew Jackson an General Tom Thumb awalkin down
the path

What shall we do says I

Come along says he We aint agoin to stop for them Get up all
the same

I tried to get up as he said but it wasnt so easy for me on account
of my not bein such a high stepper as Jone an I was a good while
agettin a good footin on the board

Mrs Jackson an the General they came right up to us an set down on
a bench which was fastened between two trees near the wall An there
they set alookin steady at us with their four little eyes like four
empty thimbles

You appear to be goin away says Mrs Jackson

Yes says Jone from the top of the wall Were agoin to take a
slight stroll outside this salubrious evenin

Do you think says she that the United States Bank would be open
this time of day

Oh no says Jone the banks all close at three oclock Its a good
deal after that now

But if I told the officers who I was wouldnt that make a
difference says she Wouldnt they go down an open the bank

Not much says Jone givin a pull which brought me right up to the
top o the wall an almost clean down the other side with one jerk I
never knowed no officers that would do that But says he a kind o
shuttin his eyes so that she shouldnt see he was lyin well talk
about that when we come back

If you see that team of little oxen says the big man send em
round to the front gate

All right says Jone an he let me down the outside of the wall as
if I had been a bag o horsefeed

But if the bank isnt open you cant pay for it when it does come we
heard the old lady asayin as we hurried off

We didnt lose no time agoin down to that station an its lucky we
didnt for a train for the city was comin jus as we got there an we
jumped aboard without havin no time to buy tickets There wasnt many
people in our car an we got a seat together

Now then says Jone as the cars went abuzzin along I feel as if
I was really on a bridaltrip which I mus say I didnt at that there
asylum

An then I said I should think not an we both bust out alaughin
as well we might feelin sich a change of surroundins

Do you think says somebody behind us when wed got through
laughin that if I was to send a boy up to the cashier he would either
come down or send me the key of the bank

We both turned aroun as quick as lightnin an if there wasnt them
two lunertics in the seat behind us

It nearly took our breaths away to see them settin there staring at
us with their thimble eyes an awearin their little straw hats both
alike

How on the livin earth did you two got here says I as soon as I
could speak

Oh we come by the same way you comeby the temperary stairs says
Mrs Jackson We thought if it was too late to draw any money tonight
it might be well to be on hand bright an early in the mornin An so
we follered you two as close as we could because we knew you could
take us right to the very bank doors an we didnt know the way
ourselves not never havin had no occasion to attend to nothin of this
kind before

Jone an I looked at each other but we didnt speak for a minute

Then says I heres a pretty kittle o fish

I should kinder say so says Jone Weve got these here two
lunertics on our hands sure enough for there aint no train back to
Pokus tonight an I wouldnt go back with em if there was We must
keep an eye on em till we can see the doctor tomorrow

I suppose we must said I but this dont seem as much like a
bridaltrip as it did a while ago

Youre right there says Jone

When the conductor came along we had to pay the fare of them two
lunertics besides our own for neither of em had a cent about em
When we got to town we went to a smallish hotel near the ferry where
Jone knowed the man who kep it who wouldnt bother about none of us
havin a scrap of baggage knowin hed get his money all the same out
of either Jone or his father The General an his sister looked a kind
o funny in their little straw hats an green carpetslippers an the
clerk didnt know whether he hadnt forgot how to read writin when the
big man put down the names of General Tom Thumb and Mrs exPresident
Andrew Jackson which he wasnt exPresident anyway bein dead but
Jone he whispered they was travelin under nommys dess plummys I told
him to say that an he would fix it all right in the mornin An then
we got some supper which it took them two lunertics a long time to eat
for they was all the time forgettin what particular kind o business
they was about an then we was showed to our rooms They had two rooms
right across the hall from ours We hadnt been inside our room five
minutes before Mrs General Jackson come aknockin at the door

Look ahere she says to me theres a unforeseen contingency in my
room An it smells

So I went right in an sure enough it did smell for she had turned on
all the gases besides the one that was lighted

What did you do that for says I aturnin them off as fast as I
could

Id like to know what theyre made for says she if they isnt to
be turned on

When I told Jone about this he looked real serious an jus then a
waiter came upstairs an went into the big mans room In a minute he
come out an says to Jone an me agrinnin

We cant suit him no better in this house

What does he want asks Jone

Why he wants a smaller bed says the waiter He says he cant sleep
in a bed as big as that an we havent none smaller in this house
which he couldnt get into if we had in my opinion says he

All right says Jone Jus you go downstairs an Ill fix him So
the man goes off still agrinnin I tell you what it is says Jone
it wont do to let them two lunertics have rooms to themselves Theyll
set this house afire or turn it upside down in the middle of the night
if they has Theres nuthin to be done but for you to sleep with the
woman an for me to sleep with the man an to keep em from cuttin up
till mornin

So Jone he went into the room where General Tom Thumb was asettin
with his hat on alookin doleful at the bed an says he

Whats the matter with the bed

Oh its too large entirely says the General It wouldnt do for
me to sleep in a bed like that It would ruin my character as a genuine
Thumb

Well says Jone its nearly two times too big for you but if you
an me was both to sleep in it it would be about right wouldnt it

Oh yes says the General An he takes off his hat an Jone says
goodnight to me an shuts the door Our room was better than Mrs
General Jacksons so I takes her in there an the fust thing she does
is to turn on all the gases

Stop that I hollers If you do that againIllIll break the
United States Bank tomorrow

Howll you do that says she

Ill draw out all my capital says I

I hope really you wont says she till Ive been there an she
leans out of the open winder to look into the street but while she
was alookin out I see her left hand acreepin up to the gas by the
winder that wasnt lighted I felt mad enough to take her by the feet
an pitch her out as you an the boarder said Pomona turning to me
histed me out of the canalboat winder

This by the way was the first intimation we had had that Pomona knew
how she came to fall out of that window

But I didnt do it she continued for there wasnt no soft water
underneath for her to fall into After we went to bed I kep awake for
a long time bein afraid shed get up in the night an turn on all the
gases and smother me alive But I fell asleep at last an when I woke
up early in the mornin the first thing I did was to feel for that
lunertic But she was gone



CHAPTER XVI IN WHICH AN OLD FRIEND APPEARS AND THE BRIDAL TRIP TAKES A
FRESH START


Gone cried Euphemia who with myself had been listening most
intently to Pomonas story

Yes continued Pomona she was gone I give one jump out of bed
and felt the gases but they was all right But she was gone an her
clothes was gone I dressed as pale as death I do expect an hurried
to Jones room an he an me an the big man was all ready in no time
to go an look for her General Tom Thumb didnt seem very anxious but
we made him hurry up an come along with us We couldnt afford to leave
him nowheres The clerk downstairsa different one from the chap who
was there the night beforesaid that a middleaged elderly lady came
down about an hour before an asked him to tell her the way to the
United States Bank an when he told her he didnt know of any such
bank she jus stared at him an wanted to know what he was put there
for So he didnt have no more to say to her an she went out an he
didnt take no notice which way she went We had the same opinion about
him that Mrs Jackson had but we didnt stop to tell him so We hunted
up an down the streets for an hour or more we asked every policeman we
met if hed seen her we went to a police station we did everything we
could think of but no Mrs Jackson turned up Then we was so tired an
hungry that we went into some place or other an got our breakfast When
we started out agin we kep on up one street an down another an
askin everybody who looked as if they had two grains of sensewhich
most of em didnt look as if they had morn one an that was in use
to get em to where they was goin At last a little ways down a small
street we seed a crowd an the minute we see it Jone an me both
said in our inside hearts There she is An sure enough when we got
there who should we see with a ring of streetloafers an boys around
her but Mrs Andrew Jackson with her little straw hat an her green
carpetslippers adancin some kind of a skippin fandango an
aholdin out her skirts with the tips of her fingers I was jus agoin
to rush in an grab her when a man walks quick into the ring and touches
her on the shoulder The minute I seed him I knowed him It was our old
boarder

It was exclaimed Euphemia

Yes it was truly him an I didnt want him to see me there in such
company an he most likely knowin I was on my bridaltrip an so I
made a dive at my bonnet to see if I had a vail on an findin one I
hauled it down

Madam says the boarder very respectful to Mrs Jackson where
do you live Cant I take you home No sir says she at least not
now If you have a carriage you may come for me after a while I am
waiting for the Bank of the United States to open an until which time
I must support myself on the light fantastic toe an then she tuk
up her skirts an begun to dance agin But she didnt make morn two
skips before I rushed in an takin her by the arm hauled her out o
the ring An then up comes the big man with his face as red as fire
Look here says he to her as if he was ready to eat her up Did you
draw every cent of that money Not yet not yet says she You did
you purseproud cantalope says he You know very well you did an
now Id like to know where my oxmoney is to come from But Jone an
me didnt intend to wait for no sich talk as this an he tuk the man
by the arm and I tuk the old woman an we jus walked em off The
boarder he told the loafers to get out an go home an none of em
follered us for they knowd if they did hed a batted em over the
head But he comes up alongside o me as I was a walkin behind with
Mrs Jackson an says he How dye do Pomona I must say I felt as
if I could slip in between two flagstones but as I couldnt get away I
said I was pretty well I heared you was on your bridal trip says he
agin is this it It was jus like him to know that an as there was
no help for it I said it was Is that your husband says he pointin
to Jone Yes says I It was very good in him to come along says
he Is these two your groomsman and bridesmaid No sir says I
Theyre crazy No wonder says he Its enough to drive em so to
see you two an then he went ahead an shook hands with Jone an told
him hed knowd me a long time but he didnt say nuthin about havin
histed me out of a winder for which I was obliged to him An then he
come back to me an says he Goodmornin I must go to the office I
hope youll have a good time for the rest of your trip If you happen
to run short o lunertics jus let me know and Ill furnish you with
another pair All right says I but you mustnt bring your little
girl along

He kinder laughed at this as we walked away an then he turned
around an come back and says he Have you been to any theayters or
anything since youve been in town No says I not one Well
says he you ought to go Which do you like best the theayter the
circus or wildbeasts I did really like the theayter best havin
thought of bein a playactor as you know but I considered Id better
let that kind o thing slide jus now as bein a little too romantic
right after the sylum an so I says Ive been once to a circus an
once to a wildbeast garden an I like em both I hardly know which I
like bestthe roarin beasts aprancin about in their cages with the
smell of blood an hay an the towerin elephants or the horses an
the music an the gauzy figgers at the circus an the splendid knights
in armor an flashin pennants all on fiery steeds aplungin agin
the sides of the ring with their flags aflyin in the grand entry
says I real excited with what I remembered about these shows

Well says he I dont wonder at your feelins An now heres two
tickets for tonight which you an your husband can have if you
like for I cant go Theyre to a meetin of the Hudson County
Entermological Society over to Hoboken at eight oclock

Over to Hoboken says I thats a long way

Oh no it isnt says he An it wont cost you a cent but the
ferry They couldnt have them shows in the city for if the creatures
was to get loose theres no knowin what might happen So take em an
have as much fun as you can for the rest of your trip Goodbye An
off he went

Well we kep straight on to the doctors an glad we was when we got
there an mad he was when we lef Mrs Jackson an the General on his
hands for we wouldnt have no more to do with em an he couldnt help
undertaking to see that they got back to the asylum I thought at first
he wouldnt lift a finger to get us our trunk but he cooled down after
a bit an said he hoped wed try some different kind of institution for
the rest of our trip which we said we thought we would

That afternoon we gawked around alookin at all the outside shows
for Jone said hed have to be pretty careful of his money now an he
was glad when I told him I had two free tickets in my pocket for a show
in the evenin

As we was awalkin down to the ferry after supper says he

Suppose you let me have a look at them tickets

So I hands em to him He reads one of em and then he reads the
other which he neednt a done for they was both alike an then he
turns to me an says he

What kind of a man is your boarderaswas

It wasnt the easiest thing in the world to say jus what he was but I
give Jone the idea in a general sort of way that he was pretty lively

So I should think says he Hes been tryin a trick on us and
sendin us to the wrong place Its rather late in the season for a show
of the kind but the place we ought to go to is a potatofield

What on earth are you talkin about says I dumbfoundered

Well says he its a trick hes been playin He thought a bridal
trip like ours ought to have some sort of a outlandish windup an so
he sent us to this place which is a meetin of chaps who are agoin
to talk about insecsprincipally potatobugs I expecan anything
stupider than that I spose your boarderaswas couldnt think of
without havin a good deal o time to consider

Its jus like him says I Lets turn round and go back which we
did prompt

We gave the tickets to a little boy who was sellin papers but I dont
believe he went

Now then says Jone after hed been thinkin awhile therell be no
more foolin on this trip Ive blocked out the whole of the rest of it
an well wind up a sight better than that boarderaswas has any idea
of Tomorrow well go to fathers an if the old gentleman has got any
money on the crops which I expec he has by this time Ill take up
a part o my share an well have a trip to Washington an see the
President an Congress an the White House an the lamp always
aburnin before the Supreme Court an

Dont say no more says I its splendid

So early the nex day we goes off jus as fast as trains would take
us to his fathers an we hadnt been there morn ten minutes before
Jone found out he had been summoned on a jury

When must you go says I when he come lookin a kind o pale to
tell me this

Right off says he The court meets this mornin If I dont hurry
up Ill have some of em after me But I wouldnt cry about it I dont
believe the casell last moren a day

The old man harnessed up an took Jone to the courthouse an I went
too for I might as well keep up the idea of a bridaltrip as not I
went up into the gallery and Jone he was set among the other men in
the jurybox

The case was about a man named Brown who married the halfsister of a
man named Adams who afterward married Browns mother and sold Brown
a house he had got from Browns grandfather in trade for half a
gristmill which the other half of was owned by Adamss halfsisters
first husband who left all his property to a soup society in trust
till his son should come of age which he never did but left a will
which give his half of the mill to Brown and the suit was between Brown
and Adams and Brown again and Adamss halfsister who was divorced
from Brown and a man named Ramsey who had put up a new overshot wheel
to the gristmill

Oh my exclaimed Euphemia How could you remember all that

I heard it so often I couldnt help remembering it replied Pomona
And she went on with her narrative

That case wasnt a easy one to understand as you may see for
yourselves and it didnt get finished that day They argyed over it a
full week When there wasnt no more witnesses to carve up one lawyer
made a speech an he set that crooked case so straight that you
could see through it from the overshot wheel clean back to Browns
grandfather Then another feller made a speech and he set the whole
thing up another way It was jus as clear to look through but it was
another case altogether no more like the other one than a applepie is
like a mug o cider An then they both took it up an they swung it
around between them till it was all twisted an knotted an wound up
an tangled worse than a skein o yarn in a nest o kittens an then
they give it to the jury

Well when them jurymen went out there wasnt none of em as Jone
tole me afterward as knew whether is was Brown or Adams as was dead
or whether the mill was to grind soup or to be run by souppower Of
course they couldnt agree three of em wanted to give a verdict for
the boy that died two of em was for Browns grandfather an the rest
was scattered some goin in for damages to the witnesses who ought to
get somethin for havin their characters ruined Jone he jus held
back ready to jine the other eleven as soon as theyd agree But they
couldnt do it an they was locked up three days and four nights Youd
better believe I got pretty wild about it but I come to court every day
an waited an waited bringin somethin to eat in a baskit

One day at dinnertime I seed the judge astandin at the courtroom
door awipin his forrid with a handkerchief an I went up to him an
said Do you think sir theyll get through this thing soon

I cant say indeed said he Are you interested in the case

I should think I was said I an then I told him about Jones bein
a juryman an how we was on our bridaltrip

Youve got my sympathy madam says he but its a difficult case to
decide an I dont wonder it takes a good while

Nor I nuther says I an my opinion about these things is that if
youd jus have them lawyers shut up in another room an make em do
their talkin to theirselves the jury could keep their minds clear and
settle the cases in no time

Theres some sense in that madam says he an then he went into
court agin

Jone never had no chance to jine in with the other fellers for they
couldnt agree an they were all discharged at last So the whole
thing went for nuthin

When Jone come out he looked like hed been drawn through a pumplog
an he says to me tiredlike

Has there been a frost

Yes says I two of em

All right then says he Ive had enough of bridaltrips with
their dry falls their lunatic asylums and their juryboxes Lets
go home and settle down We neednt be afraid now that theres been a
frost

Oh why will you live in such a dreadful place cried Euphemia You
ought to go somewhere where you neednt be afraid of chills

Thats jus what I thought maam returned Pomona But Jone an me
got a diseasemap of this country an we looked all over it careful an
wherever there wasnt chills there was somethin that seemed a good deal
wuss to us An says Jone If Im to have anything the matter with me
give me somethin Im used to It dont do for a man o my time o life
to go changin his diseases

So home we went An there we is now An as this is the end of the
bridaltrip story Ill go an take a look at the cow an the chickens
an the horse if you dont mind

Which we didntand we gladly went with her over the estate



CHAPTER XVII IN WHICH WE TAKE A VACATION AND LOOK FOR DAVID DUTTON


It was about noon of a very fair July day in the next summer when
Euphemia and myself arrived at the little town where we were to take the
stage up into the mountains We were off for a two weeks vacation and
our minds were a good deal easier than when we went away before and
left Pomona at the helm We had enlarged the boundaries of Rudder
Grange having purchased the house with enough adjoining land to make
quite a respectable farm Of course I could not attend to the manifold
duties on such a place and my wife seldom had a happier thought than
when she proposed that we should invite Pomona and her husband to come
and live with us Pomona was delighted and Jonas was quite willing
to run our farm So arrangements were made and the young couple were
established in apartments in our back building and went to work as if
taking care of us and our possessions was the ultimate object of their
lives Jonas was such a steady fellow that we feared no trouble from
treeman or lightning rodder during this absence

Our destination was a country tavern on the stageroad not far from the
point where the road crosses the ridge of the mountainrange and about
sixteen miles from the town We had heard of this tavern from a friend
of ours who had spent a summer there The surrounding country was
lovely and the house was kept by a farmer who was a good soul and
tried to make his guests happy These were generally passing farmers and
wagoners or stagepassengers stopping for a meal but occasionally a
person from the cities like our friend came to spend a few weeks in
the mountains

So hither we came for an outoftheworld spot like this was just what
we wanted When I took our places at the stageoffice I inquired for
David Dutton the farmer tavernkeeper before mentioned but the agent
did not know of him

However said he the driver knows everybody on the road and hell
set you down at the house

So off we started having paid for our tickets on the basis that we
were to ride about sixteen miles We had seats on top and the trip
although slowfor the road wound uphill steadilywas a delightful
one Our way lay for the greater part of the time through the woods
but now and then we came to a farm and a turn in the road often gave us
lovely views of the foothills and the valleys behind us

But the driver did not know where Duttons tavern was This we found out
after we had started Some persons might have thought it wiser to settle
this matter before starting but I am not at all sure that it would have
been so We were going to this tavern and did not wish to go anywhere
else If people did not know where it was it would be well for us to
go and look for it We knew the road that it was on and the locality in
which it was to be found

Still it was somewhat strange that a stagedriver passing along
the road every weekdayone day one way and the next the other
wayshould not know a publichouse like Duttons

If I remember rightly I said the stage used to stop there for the
passengers to take supper

Well then it aint on this side o the ridge said the driver we
stop for supper about a quarter of a mile on the other side at Pete
Lowrys Perhaps Dutton used to keep that place Was it called the
Ridge House

I did not remember the name of the house but I knew very well that it
was not on the other side of the ridge

Then said the driver Im sure I dont know where it is But Ive
only been on the road about a year and your man may a moved away
afore I come But there aint no tavern this side the ridge arter ye
leave Delhi and thats nowheres nigh the ridge

There were a couple of farmers who were sitting by the driver and who
had listened with considerable interest to this conversation Presently
one of them turned around to me and said

Is it Dave Dutton yere askin about

Yes I replied thats his name

Well I think hes dead said he

At this I began to feel uneasy and I could see that my wife shared my
trouble

Then the other farmer spoke up

I dont believe hes dead Hiram said he to his companion I heered
of him this spring Hes got a sheepfarm on the other side o the
mountain and hes a livin there Thats what I heered at any rate
But he dont live on this road any more he continued turning to us
He used to keep tavern on this road and the stages did used to stop
fur supperor else dinner I dont jist reecollect which But he dont
keep tavern on this road no more

Of course not said his companion if hes a livin over the
mountain But I blieve hes dead

I asked the other farmer if he knew how long it had been since Dutton
had left this part of the country

I dont know fur certain he said but I know he was keeping tavern
here two year ago this fall fur I came along here myself and
stopped there to git supperor dinner I dont jist reecollect which

It had been three years since our friend had boarded at Duttons house
There was no doubt that the man was not living at his old place now
My wife and I now agreed that it was very foolish in us to come so far
without making more particular inquiries But we had had an idea that a
man who had a place like Duttons tavern would live there always

What are ye goin to do asked the driver very much interested
for it was not every day that he had passengers who had lost their
destination Ye might go on to Lowrys He takes boarders sometimes

But Lowrys did not attract us An ordinary countrytavern where
stagepassengers took supper was not what we came so far to find

Do you know where this house o Duttons is said the driver to the
man who had once taken either dinner or supper there

Oh yes Id know the house well enough if I saw it Its the fust
house this side o Lowrys

With a big pole in front of it asked the driver

Yes there was a signpole in front of it

An a long porch

Yes

Oh well said the driver settling himself in his seat I know all
about that house Thats a empty house I didnt think you meant that
house Theres nobody lives there An yit now I come to remember I
have seen people about too I tell ye what ye better do Since yere so
set on staying on this side the ridge ye better let me put ye down
at Dan Carsons place Thats jist about quarter of a mile from where
Dutton used to live Dans wife can tell ye all about the Duttons an
about everybody else too in this part o the country and if there
aint nobody livin at the old tavern ye can stay all night at Carsons
and Ill stop an take you back tomorrow when I come along

We agreed to this plan for there was nothing better to be done and
late in the afternoon we were set down with our small trunkfor we
were traveling under light weightat Dan Carsons door The stage was
rather behind time and the driver whipped up and left us to settle our
own affairs He called back however that he would keep a good lookout
for us tomorrow

Mrs Carson soon made her appearance and very naturally was somewhat
surprised to see visitors with their baggage standing on her little
porch She was a plain coarsely dressed woman with an apron full
of chips and kindling wood and a fine mind for detail as we soon
discovered

Jist so said she putting down the chips and inviting us to seats on
a bench Dave Duttons folks is all moved away Dave has a good farm
on the other side o the mountain an it never did pay him to keep that
tavern specially as he didnt sell liquor When he went away his son
Al come there to live with his wife an the old man left a good deal
o furniter and things fur him but Als wife aint satisfied here and
though theyve been here off an on the house is shet up most o the
time Its fur sale an to rent both ef anybody wants it Im sorry
about you too fur it was a nice tavern when Dave kept it

We admitted that we were also very sorry and the kindhearted woman
showed a great deal of sympathy

You might stay here but we haint got no fit room where you two could
sleep

At this Euphemia and I looked very blank But you could go up to the
house and stay jist as well as not Mrs Carson continued Theres
plenty o things there an I keep the key For the matter o that ye
might take the house for as long as ye want to stay Dave d be glad
enough to rent it and if the lady knows how to keep house it wouldnt
be no trouble at all jist for you two We could let ye have all the
victuals yed want cheap and theres plenty o wood there cut and
everything handy

We looked at each other We agreed Here was a chance for a rare good
time It might be better perhaps than anything we had expected

The bargain was struck Mrs Carson who seemed vested with all the
necessary powers of attorney appeared to be perfectly satisfied with
our trustworthiness and when I paid on the spot the small sum she
thought proper for two weeks rent she evidently considered she had
done a very good thing for Dave Dutton and herself

Ill jist put some bread an eggs an coffee an pork an things in
a basket an Ill have em took up fur ye with yer trunk an Ill go
with ye an take some milk Here Danny she cried and directly her
husband a long thin sunburnt sandyheaded man appeared and to
him she told in a few words our story and ordered him to hitch up the
cart and be ready to take our trunk and the basket up to Duttons old
house

When all was ready we walked up the hill followed by Danny and
the cart We found the house a large low oldfashioned farmhouse
standing near the road with a long piazza in front and a magnificent
view of mountaintops in the rear Within the lower rooms were large
and low with quite a good deal of furniture in them There was no
earthly reason why we should not be perfectly jolly and comfortable
here The more we saw the more delighted we were at the odd experience
we were about to have Mrs Carson busied herself in getting things in
order for our supper and general accommodation She made Danny carry
our trunk to a bedroom in the second story and then set him to work
building a fire in a great fireplace with a crane for the kettle

When she had done all she could it was nearly dark and after lighting
a couple of candles she left us to go home and get supper for her own
family

As she and Danny were about to depart in the cart she ran back to ask
us if we would like to borrow a dog

There aint nuthin to be afeard of she said for nobody hardly ever
takes the trouble to lock the doors in these parts but bein city
folks I thought ye might feel better if ye had a dog

We made haste to tell her that we were not city folks but declined the
dog Indeed Euphemia remarked that she would be much more afraid of a
strange dog than of robbers

After supper which we enjoyed as much as any meal we ever ate in our
lives we each took a candle and after arranging our bedroom for the
night we explored the old house There were lots of curious things
everywherethings that were apparently so old timey as my wife
remarked that David Dutton did not care to take them with him to his
new farm and so left them for his son who probably cared for them even
less than his father did There was a garret extending over the whole
house and filled with old spinningwheels and strings of onions and
all sorts of antiquated bricabrac which was so fascinating to me
that I could scarcely tear myself away from it but Euphemia who was
dreadfully afraid that I would set the whole place on fire at length
prevailed on me to come down

We slept soundly that night in what was probably the best bedroom of
the house and awoke with a feeling that we were about to enter on a
period of some uncommon kind of jollity which we found to be true
when we went down to get breakfast I made the fire Euphemia made the
coffee and Mrs Carson came with cream and some fresh eggs The good
woman was in high spirits She was evidently pleased at the idea of
having neighbors temporary though they were and it had probably been
a long time since she had had such a chance of selling milk eggs and
sundries It was almost the same as opening a country store We bought
groceries and everything of her

We had a glorious time that day We were just starting out for a
mountain stroll when our stagedriver came along on his down trip

Hello he called out Want to go back this morning

Not a bit of it I cried We wont go back for a couple of weeks
Weve settled here for the present

The man smiled He didnt seem to understand it exactly but he was
evidently glad to see us so well satisfied If he had had time to stop
and have the matter explained to him he would probably have been better
satisfied but as it was he waved his whip to us and drove on He was a
good fellow

We strolled all day having locked up the house and taken our lunch
with us and when we came back it seemed really like coming home
Mrs Carson with whom we had left the key had brought the milk and was
making the fire This woman was too kind We determined to try and repay
her in some way After a splendid supper we went to bed happy

The next day was a repetition of this one but the day after it
rained So we determined to enjoy the old tavern and we rummaged about
everywhere I visited the garret again and we went to the old barn
with its mows half full of hay and had rare times climbing about there
We were delighted that it happened to rain In a woodshed near the
house I saw a big square board with letters on it I examined the
board and found it was a signa hanging signand on it was painted
in letters that were yet quite plain


 FARMERS
 AND
 MECHANICS
 HOTEL


I called to Euphemia and told her that I had found the old tavern sign
She came to look at it and I pulled it out

Soldiers and sailors she exclaimed thats funny

I looked over on her side of the sign and sure enough there was the
inscription


 SOLDIERS
 AND
 SAILORS
 HOUSE


They must have bought this comprehensive sign in some town I said
Such a name would never have been chosen for a country tavern like
this But I wish they hadnt taken it down The house would look more
like what it ought to be with its sign hanging before it

Well then said Euphemia lets put it up I agreed instantly to
this proposition and we went to look for a ladder We found one in the
wagonhouse and carried it out to the signpost in the front of the
house It was raining gently during these performances but we had on
our old clothes and were so much interested in our work that we did not
care for a little rain I carried the sign to the post and then at the
imminent risk of breaking my neck I hung it on its appropriate hooks on
the transverse beam of the signpost Now our tavern was really what it
pretended to be We gazed on the sign with admiration and content

Do you think we had better keep it up all the time I asked of my
wife

Certainly said she Its a part of the house The place isnt
complete without it

But suppose some one should come along and want to be entertained

But no one will And if people do come Ill take care of the soldiers
and sailors if you will attend to the farmers and mechanics

I consented to this and we went indoors to prepare dinner



CHAPTER XVIII OUR TAVERN


The next day was clear again and we rambled in the woods until the sun
was nearly down and so were late about supper We were just taking
our seats at the table when we heard a footstep on the front porch
Instantly the same thought came into each of our minds

I do believe said Euphemia thats somebody who has mistaken this
for a tavern I wonder whether its a soldier or a farmer or a sailor
but you had better go and see

I went to see prompted to move quickly by the newcomer pounding his
cane on the bare floor of the hall I found him standing just inside
of the front door He was a small man with long hair and beard and
dressed in a suit of clothes of a remarkable colorsomething of the
hue of faded snuff He had a big stick and carried a large flat valise
in one hand

He bowed to me very politely

Can I stop here tonight he asked taking off his hat as my wife put
her head out of the kitchendoor

Whyno sir I said This is not a tavern

Not a tavern he exclaimed I dont understand that You have a sign
out

That is true I said but that is only for fun so to speak We are
here temporarily and we put up that sign just to please ourselves

That is pretty poor fun for me said the man I am very tired and
more hungry than tired Couldnt you let me have a little supper at any
rate

Euphemia glanced at me I nodded

You are welcome to some supper she said Come in We eat in the
kitchen because it is more convenient and because it is so much more
cheerful than the diningroom There is a pump out there and here is a
towel if you would like to wash your hands

As the man went out the back door I complimented my wife She was really
an admirable hostess

The individual in faded snuffcolor was certainly hungry and he seemed
to enjoy his supper During the meal he gave us some account of himself
He was an artist and had traveled mostly on foot it would appear
over a great part of the country He had in his valise some very pretty
little colored sketches of scenes in Mexico and California which he
showed us after supper Why he carried these pictureswhich were done
on stiff paperabout with him I do not know He said he did not care
to sell them as he might use them for studies for larger pictures some
day His valise which he opened wide on the table seemed to be filled
with papers drawings and matters of that kind I suppose he preferred
to wear his clothes instead of carrying them about in his valise

After sitting for about half an hour after supper he rose with
an uncertain sort of smile and said he supposed he must be moving
onasking at the same time how far it was to the tavern over the
ridge

Just wait one moment if you please said Euphemia And she beckoned
me out of the room

Dont you think said she that we could keep him all night Theres
no moon and it would be a fearful dark walk I know to the other side
of the mountain There is a room upstairs that I can fix for him in ten
minutes and I know hes honest

How do you know it I asked

Well because he wears such curiouscolored clothes No criminal would
ever wear such clothes He could never pass unnoticed anywhere and
being probably the only person in the world who dressed that way he
could always be detected

You are doubtless correct I replied Let us keep him

When we told the good man that he could stay all night he was extremely
obliged to us and went to bed quite early After we had fastened the
house and had gone to our room my wife said to me

Where is your pistol

I produced it

Well said she I think you ought to have it where you can get at
it

Why so I asked You generally want me to keep it out of sight and
reach

Yes but when there is a strange man in the house we ought to take
extra precautions

But this man you say is honest I replied If he committed a crime he
could not escapehis appearance is so peculiar

But that wouldnt do us any good if we were both murdered said
Euphemia pulling a chair up to my side of the bed and laying the
pistol carefully thereon with the muzzle toward the bed

We were not murdered and we had a very pleasant breakfast with the
artist who told us more anecdotes of his life in Mexico and other
places When after breakfast he shut up his valise preparatory to
starting away we felt really sorry When he was ready to go he asked
for his bill

Oh There is no bill I exclaimed We have no idea of charging you
anything We dont really keep a hotel as I told you

If I had known that said he looking very grave I would not have
stayed There is no reason why you should give me food and lodgings and
I would not and did not ask it I am able to pay for such things and
I wish to do so

We argued with him for some time speaking of the habits of country
people and so on but he would not be convinced He had asked for
accommodation expecting to pay for it and would not be content until he
had done so

Well said Euphemia we are not keeping this house for profit and
you cant force us to make anything out of you If you will be satisfied
to pay us just what it cost us to entertain you I suppose we shall have
to let you do that Take a seat for a minute and I will make out your
bill

So the artist and I sat down and talked of various matters while
my wife got out her traveling stationerybox and sat down to the
diningtable to make out the bill After a long long time as it
appeared to me I said

My dear if the amount of that bill is at all proportioned to the
length of time it takes to make it out I think our friend here will
wish he had never said anything about it

Its nearly done said she without raising her head and in about
ten or fifteen minutes more she rose and presented the bill to our
guest As I noticed that he seemed somewhat surprised at it I asked him
to let me look over it with him The bill of which I have a copy read
as follows

 Amount due 22 1724 cts


The worthy artist burst out laughing when he read this bill and so did
I

You neednt laugh said Euphemia reddening a little That is exactly
what your entertainment cost and we do not intend to take a cent more
We get things here in such small quantities that I can tell quite easily
what a meal costs us and I have calculated that bill very carefully

So I should think madam said the artist but it is not quite right
You have charged nothing for your trouble and services

No said my wife for I took no additional trouble to get your meals
What I did I should have done if you had not come To be sure I
did spend a few minutes preparing your room I will charge you seven
twentyfourths of a cent for that thus making your bill twentythree
centseven money

I cannot gainsay reasoning like yours madam he said and he took
a quarter from a very fat old pocketbook and handed it to her She
gravely gave him two cents change and then taking the bill receipted
it and handed it back to him

We were sorry to part with our guest for he was evidently a good
fellow I walked with him a little way up the road and got him to let
me copy his bill in my memorandumbook The original he said he would
always keep

A day or two after the artists departure we were standing on the front
piazza We had had a late breakfastconsequent upon a long tramp the
day beforeand had come out to see what sort of a day it was likely
to be We had hardly made up our minds on the subject when the morning
stage came up at full speed and stopped at our gate

Hello cried the driver He was not our driver He was a tall man in
high boots and had a great reputation as a manager of horsesso Danny
Carson told me afterward There were two drivers on the line and each
of them made one trip a day going up one day in the afternoon and down
the next day in the morning

I went out to see what this driver wanted

Cant you give my passengers breakfast he asked

Why no I exclaimed looking at the stage loaded inside and out
This isnt a tavern We couldnt get breakfast for a stageload of
people

What have you got a sign up fur then roared the driver getting red
in the face

Thats so cried two or three men from the top of the stage If it
aint a tavern whats that sign doin there

I saw I must do something I stepped up close to the stage and looked in
and up

Are there any sailors in this stage I said There was no response
Any soldiers Any farmers or mechanics

At the latter question I trembled but fortunately no one answered

Then said I you have no right to ask to be accommodated for as
you may see from the sign our house is only for soldiers sailors
farmers and mechanics

And besides cried Euphemia from the piazza we havent anything to
give you for breakfast

The people in and on the stage grumbled a good deal at this and looked
as if they were both disappointed and hungry while the driver ripped
out an oath which had he thrown it across a creek would soon have
made a goodsized millpond

He gathered up his reins and turned a sinister look on me

Ill be even with you yit he cried as he dashed off

In the afternoon Mrs Carson came up and told us that the stage had
stopped there and that she had managed to give the passengers some
coffee bread and butter and ham and eggs though they had had to
wait their turns for cups and plates It appeared that the driver had
quarreled with the Lowry people that morning because the breakfast was
behindhand and he was kept waiting So he told his passengers that there
was another tavern a few miles down the road and that he would take
them there to breakfast

Hes an awful ugly man that he is said Mrs Carson an hed better
a stayed at Lowrys fur he had to wait a good sight longer after
all as it turned out But hes dreadful mad at you an says hell
bring ye farmers an soldiers and sailors an mechanics if
thats what ye want I spect hell do his best to git a load of them
particular people an drop em at yer door Id take down that sign ef
I was you Not that me an Danny minds fur were glad to git a stage to
feed an ef youve any single man that wants lodgin weve fixed up a
room and kin keep him overnight

Notwithstanding this warning Euphemia and I decided not to take in our
sign We were not to be frightened by a stagedriver The next day our
own driver passed us on the road as he was going down

So yere pertickler about the people ye take in are ye said he
smiling Thats all right but ye made Bill awful mad

It was quite late on a Monday afternoon that Bill stopped at our house
again He did not call out this time He simply drew up and a man with
a big black valise clambered down from the top of the stage Then Bill
shouted to me as I walked down to the gate looking rather angry I
suppose

I was agoin to git ye a whole stageload to stay all night but that
onell do ye I reckon Ha ha And off he went probably fearing that
I would throw his passenger up on the top of the stage again

The newcomer entered the gate He was a dark man with black hair and
black whiskers and mustache and black eyes He wore clothes that had
been black but which were now toned down by a good deal of dust and
as I have said he carried a black valise

Why did you stop here said I rather inhospitably Dont you know
that we do not accommodate

Yes I know he said walking up on the piazza and setting down his
valise that you only take soldiers sailors farmers and mechanics at
this house I have been told all about it and if I had not thoroughly
understood the matter I should not have thought of such a thing as
stopping here If you will sit down for a few moments I will explain
Saying this he took a seat on a bench by the door but Euphemia and I
continued to stand

I am he continued a soldier a sailor a farmer and a mechanic
Do not doubt my word I will prove it to you in two minutes When but
seventeen years of age circumstances compelled me to take charge of a
farm in New Hampshire and I kept up that farm until I was twentyfive
During this time I built several barns wagonhouses and edifices of
the sort on my place and becoming expert in this branch of mechanical
art I was much sought after by the neighboring farmers who employed
me to do similar work for them In time I found this new business so
profitable that I gave up farming altogether But certain unfortunate
speculations threw me on my back and finally having gone from bad to
worse I found myself in Boston where in sheer desperation I went
on board a coasting vessel as landsman I remained on this vessel for
nearly a year but it did not suit me I was often sick and did not
like the work I left the vessel at one of the Southern ports and
it was not long after she sailed that finding myself utterly without
means I enlisted as a soldier I remained in the army for some years
and was finally honorably discharged So you see that what I said was
true I belong to each and all of these businesses and professions And
now that I have satisfied you on this point let me show you a book for
which I have the agency in this country He stooped down opened his
valise and took out a goodsized volume This book said he is the
Flora and Fauna of Carthage County it is written by one of the first
scientific men of the country and gives you a description with
an authentic woodcut of each of the plants and animals of the
countyindigenous or naturalized Owing to peculiar advantages enjoyed
by our firm we are enabled to put this book at the very low price of
three dollars and seventyfive cents It is sold by subscription only
and should be on the centertable in every parlor in this county If you
will glance over this book sir you will find it as interesting as a
novel and as useful as an encyclopaedia

I dont want the book I said and I dont care to look at it

But if you were to look at it you would want it Im sure

Thats a good reason for not looking at it then I answered If you
came to get us to subscribe for that book we need not take up any more
of your time for we shall not subscribe

Oh I did not come for that alone he said I shall stay here
tonight and start out in the morning to work up the neighborhood If
you would like this bookand Im sure you have only to look at it to do
thatyou can deduct the amount of my bill from the subscription price
and

What did you say you charged for this book asked Euphemia stepping
forward and picking up the volume

Three seventyfive is the subscription price maam but that book is
not for sale That is merely a sample If you put your name down on
my list you will be served with your book in two weeks As I told your
husband it will come very cheap to you because you can deduct what you
charge me for supper lodging and breakfast

Indeed said my wife and then she remarked that she must go in the
house and get supper

When will supper be ready the man asked as she passed him

At first she did not answer him but then she called back

In about half an hour

Good said the man but I wish it was ready now And now sir if you
would just glance over this book while we are waiting for supper

I cut him very short and went out into the road I walked up and down in
front of the house in a bad humor I could not bear to think of my wife
getting supper for this fellow who was striding about on the piazza
as if he was very hungry and very impatient Just as I returned to the
house the bell rang from within

Joyful sound said the man and in he marched I followed close behind
him On one end of the table in the kitchen supper was set for one
person and as the man entered Euphemia motioned him to the table The
supper looked like a remarkably good one A cup of coffee smoked by the
side of the plate there was ham and eggs and a small omelette there
were fried potatoes some fresh radishes a plate of hot biscuit and
some preserves The mans eyes sparkled

I am sorry said he that I am to eat alone for I hoped to have your
good company but if this plan suits you it suits me and he drew up
a chair

Stop said Euphemia advancing between him and the table You are not
to eat that This is a sample supper If you order a supper like it one
will be served to you in two weeks

At this I burst into a roar of laughter my wife stood pale and
determined and the man drew back looking first at one of us and then
at the other

Am I to understand he said

Yes I interrupted you are There is nothing more to be said on this
subject You may go now You came here to annoy us knowing that we did
not entertain travelers and now you see what you have made by it and
I opened the door

The man evidently thought that a reply was not necessary and he walked
out without a word Taking up his valise which he had put in the hall
he asked if there was any publichouse near by

No I said but there is a farmhouse a short distance down the road
where they will be glad to have you And down the road he went to Mrs
Carsons I am sorry to say that he sold her a Flora and Fauna before
he went to bed that night

We were much amused at the termination of this affair and I became if
possible a still greater admirer of Euphemias talents for management
But we both agreed that it would not do to keep up the sign any longer
We could not tell when the irate driver might not pounce down upon us
with a customer

But I hate to take it down said Euphemia it looks so much like a
surrender

Do not trouble yourself said I I have an idea

The next morning I went down to Danny Carsons little shophe was
a wheelwright as well as a farmerand I got from him two pots of
paintone black and one whiteand some brushes I took down our sign
and painted out the old lettering and instead of it I painted in
bold and somewhat regular characters new names for our tavern

On one side of the sign I painted


 SOAPMAKERS
 AND
 BOOKBINDERS
 HOTEL


And on the other side


 UPHOLSTERERS
 AND
 DENTISTS
 HOUSE


Now then I said I dont believe any of those people will be
traveling along the road while we are here or at any rate they wont
want to stop

We admired this sign very much and sat on the piazza that afternoon
to see how it would strike Bill as he passed by It seemed to strike
him pretty hard for he gazed with all his eyes at one side of it as he
approached and then as he passed it he actually pulled up to read the
other side

All right he called out as he drove off All right All right

Euphemia didnt like the way he said all right It seemed to her she
said as if he intended to do something which would be all right for
him but not at all so for us I saw she was nervous about it for that
evening she began to ask me questions about the traveling propensities
of soapmakers upholsterers and dentists

Do not think anything more about that my dear I said I will take
the sign down in the morning We are here to enjoy ourselves and not to
be worried

And yet said she it would worry me to think that that driver
frightened us into taking down the sign I tell you what I wish you
would do Paint out those names and let me make a sign Then I promise
you I will not be worried

The next day therefore I took down the sign and painted out my
inscriptions It was a good deal of trouble for my letters were
fresh but it was a rainy day and I had plenty of time and succeeded
tolerably well Then I gave Euphemia the blackpaint pot and the freedom
of the sign

I went down to the creek to try a little fishing in wet weather and
when I returned the new sign was done On one side it read


 FLIES
 AND
 WASPS
 HOTEL


On the other


 HUNDREDLEGGERS
 AND
 REDANTS
 HOUSE


You see said euphemia if any individuals mentioned thereon apply
for accommodation we can say we are full

This sign hung triumphantly for several days when one morning just as
we had finished breakfast we were surprised to hear the stage stop at
the door and before we could go out to see who had arrived into the
room came our own stagedriver as we used to call him He had actually
left his team to come and see us

I just thought Id stop an tell ye said he that ef ye dont look
out Billll get ye inter trouble Hes bound to git the best o ye an
I heared this mornin at Lowrys that hes agoin to bring the county
clerk up here tomorrow to see about yer license fur keepin a hotel
He says ye keep changin yer signs but that dont differ to him for
he kin prove yeve kept travelers overnight an ef ye havent got no
license hell make the county clerk come down on ye heavy Im sure o
that fur I know Bill An so I thought Id stop an tell ye

I thanked him and admitted that this was a rather serious view of the
case Euphemia pondered a moment Then said she

I dont see why we should stay here any longer Its going to rain
again and our vacation is up tomorrow anyway Could you wait a little
while while we pack up she said to the driver

Oh yes he replied I kin wait as well as not Ive only got one
passenger an hes on top aholdin the horses He aint in any hurry
I know an Im ahead o time

In less than twenty minutes we had packed our trunk locked up the
house and were in the stage and as we drove away we cast a last
admiring look at Euphemias sign slowly swinging in the wind I would
much like to know if it is swinging there yet I feel certain there has
been no lack of custom

We stopped at Mrs Carsons paid her what we owed her and engaged her
to go up to the tavern and put things in order She was very sorry we
were going but hoped we would come back again some other summer We
said that it was quite possible that we might do so but that next
time we did not think we would try to have a tavern of our own



CHAPTER XIX THE BABY AT RUDDER GRANGE


For some reason not altogether understood by me there seemed to be a
continued series of new developments at our home I had supposed when
the events spoken of in the last chapter had settled down to their
proper places in our little history that our life would flow on in
an even commonplace way with few or no incidents worthy of being
recorded But this did not prove to be the case After a time the
uniformity and quiet of our existence was considerably disturbed

This disturbance was caused by a baby not a rude imperious baby but
a child who was generally of a quiet and orderly turn of mind But it
disarranged all our plans all our habits all the ordinary disposition
of things

It was in the summertime during my vacation that it began to exert
its full influence upon us A more unfortunate season could not have
been selected At first I may say that it did not exert its full
influence upon me I was away during the day and in the evening its
influence was not exerted to any great extent upon anybody As I have
said its habits were exceedingly orderly But during my vacation the
things came to pass which have made this chapter necessary

I did not intend taking a trip As in a former vacation I proposed
staying at home and enjoying those delights of the country which my
business in town did not allow me to enjoy in the working weeks and
months of the year I had no intention of camping out or of doing
anything of that kind but many were the trips rides and excursions I
had planned

I found however that if I enjoyed myself in this wise I must do it
for the most part alone It was not that Euphemia could not go with
methere was really nothing to preventit was simply that she had
lost for the time her interest in everything except that baby

She wanted me to be happy to amuse myself to take exercise to do
whatever I thought was pleasant but she herself was so much engrossed
with the child that she was often ignorant of what I intended to do or
had done She thought she was listening to what I said to her but in
reality she was occupied mind and body with the baby or listening
for some sound which should indicate that she ought to go and be
occupied with it

I would often say to her Why cant you let Pomona attend to it You
surely need not give up your whole time and your whole mind to the
child

But she would always answer that Pomona had a great many things to do
and that she couldnt at all times attend to the baby Suppose for
instance that she should be at the barn

I once suggested that a nurse should be procured but at this she
laughed

There is very little to do she said and I really like to do it

Yes said I but you spend so much of your time in thinking how glad
you will be to do that little when it is to be done that you cant
give me any attention at all

Now you have no cause to say that she exclaimed You know very
well there and away she ran It had just begun to cry

Naturally I was getting tired of this I could never begin a sentence
and feel sure that I would be allowed to finish it Nothing was
important enough to delay attention to an infantile whimper

Jonas too was in a state of unrest He was obliged to wear his good
clothes a great part of the time for he was continually going on
errands to the village and these errands were so important that they
took precedence of everything else It gave me a melancholy sort of
pleasure sometimes to do Jonass work when he was thus sent away

I asked him one day how he liked it all

Well said he reflectively I cant say as I understand it exactly
It does seem queer to me that such a little thing should take up pretty
nigh all the time of three people I suppose after a while this he
said with a grave smile that you may be wanting to turn in and help
I did not make any answer to this for Jonas was at that moment
summoned to the house but it gave me an idea In fact it gave me two
ideas

The first was that Jonass remark was not entirely respectful He was my
hired man but he was a very respectable man and an American man and
therefore might sometimes be expected to say things which a foreigner
not known to be respectable would not think of saying if he wished
to keep his place The fact that Jonas had always been very careful to
treat me with much civility caused this remark to make more impression
on me I felt that he had in a measure reason for it

The other idea was one which grew and developed in my mind until I
afterward formed a plan upon it I determined however before I carried
out my plan to again try to reason with Euphemia

If it was our own baby I said or even the child of one of us by a
former marriage it would be a different thing but to give yourself
up so entirely to Pomonas baby seems to me unreasonable Indeed I
never heard of any case exactly like it It is reversing all the usages
of society for the mistress to take care of the servants baby

The usages of society are not worth much sometimes said Euphemia
and you must remember that Pomona is a very different kind of a
person from an ordinary servant She is much more like a member of the
familyI cant exactly explain what kind of a member but I understand
it myself She has very much improved since she has been married and
you know yourself how quiet andand nice she is and as for the
baby its just as good and pretty as any baby and it may grow up to
be better than any of us Some of our presidents have sprung from lowly
parents

But this one is a girl I said

Well then replied Euphemia she may be a presidents wife

Another thing I remarked I dont believe Jonas and Pomona like your
keeping their baby so much to yourself

Nonsense said Euphemia a girl in Pomonas position couldnt help
being glad to have a lady take an interest in her baby and help bring
it up And as for Jonas he would be a cruel man if he wasnt pleased
and grateful to have his wife relieved of so much trouble Pomona
is that you You can bring it here now if you want to get at your
clearstarching

I dont believe that Pomona hankered after clearstarching but she
brought the baby and I went away I could not see any hope ahead Of
course in time it would grow up but then it couldnt grow up during
my vacation

Then it was that I determined to carry out my plan

I went to the stable and harnessed the horse to the little carriage
Jonas was not there and I had fallen out of the habit of calling him
I drove slowly through the yard and out of the gate No one called to me
or asked where I was going How different this was from the old times
Then some one would not have failed to know where I was going and
in all probability she would have gone with me But now I drove away
quietly and undisturbed

About three miles from our house was a settlement known as New Dublin
It was a cluster of poor and doleful houses inhabited entirely by Irish
people whose dirt and poverty seemed to make them very contented and
happy The men were generally away at their work during the day but
there was never any difficulty in finding some one at home no matter at
what house one called I was acquainted with one of the matrons of this
locality a Mrs Duffy who had occasionally undertaken some odd jobs at
our house and to her I made a visit

She was glad to see me and wiped off a chair for me

Mrs Duffy said I I want to rent a baby

At first the good woman could not understand me but when I made plain
to her that I wished for a short time to obtain the exclusive use and
control of a baby for which I was willing to pay a liberal rental she
burst into long and violent laughter It seemed to her like a person
coming into the country to purchase weeds Weeds and children were so
abundant in New Dublin But she gradually began to see that I was in
earnest and as she knew I was a trusty person and somewhat noted
for the care I took of my live stock she was perfectly willing to
accommodate me but feared she had nothing on hand of the age I desired

Me childther are all agoin about she said Ye kin see a poile uv
em out yon in the road an theres more uv em on the fince But
ye nade have no fear about gittin wan Theres sthacks of em in the
place Ill jist run over to Mrs Hogans wid ye Shes got sixteen or
siventeen mostly small for Hogan brought four or five wid him when he
married her an shell be glad to rint wan uv em So throwing her
apron over her head she accompanied me to Mrs Hogans

That lady was washing but she cheerfully stopped her work while Mrs
Duffy took her to one side and explained my errand Mrs Hogan did not
appear to be able to understand why I wanted a babyespecially for so
limited a periodbut probably concluded that if I would take good care
of it and would pay well for it the matter was my own affair for
she soon came and said that if I wanted a baby Id come to the right
place Then she began to consider what one she would let me have I
insisted on a young onethere was already a little baby at our house
and the folks there would know how to manage it

Oh ye want it fer coompany for the ither one is that it said Mrs
Hogan a new light breaking in upon her An thats a good plan sure
It must be dridful lownly in a house wid ownly wan baby Now theres
onePollywould she do

Why she can run I said I dont want one that can run

Oh dear said Mrs Hogan with a sigh they all begin to run very
airly Now Polly isnt owld at all at all

I can see that said I but I want one that you can put in a
cradleone that will have to stay there when you put it in

It was plain that Mrs Hogans present stock did not contain exactly
what I wanted and directly Mrs Duffy exclaimed Theres Mary
McCannan roight across the way

Mrs Hogan said Yis sure and we all went over to a little house
opposite

Now thin said Mrs Duffy entering the house and proudly drawing a
small coverlid from a little boxbed in a corner what do you think of
that

Why there are two of them I exclaimed

To be sure said Mrs Duffy Theyre tweens Theres always two uv
em when theyre tweens An theyre young enough

Yes said I doubtfully but I couldnt take both Do you think their
mother would rent one of them

The women shook their heads Ye see sir said Mrs Hogan Mary
McCann isnt here bein gone out to a wash but she ownly has four or
foive childther an she aint much used to em yit an I kin spake fer
her that shed niver siparate a pair o tweens When she gits a dozen
hersilf and marries a widow jintleman wid a lot uv his own shell
be glad enough to be lettin ye have yer pick to take wan uv em fer
coompany to yer own baby at foive dollars a week Moind that

I visited several houses after this still in company with Mrs Hogan
and Mrs Duffy and finally secured a youngish infant who having been
left motherless had become what Mrs Duffy called a bottlebaby and
was in charge of a neighboring aunt It seemed strange that this child
so eminently adapted to purposes of rental was not offered to me at
first but I suppose the Irish ladies who had the matter in charge
wanted to benefit themselves or some of their near friends before
giving the general public of New Dublin a chance

The child suited me very well and I agreed to take it for as many days
as I might happen to want it but to pay by the week in advance It was
a boy with a suggestion of orangered bloom all over its head and what
looked to me like freckles on its cheeks while its little nose turned
up even more than those of babies generally turnabove a very long
upper lip His eyes were blue and twinkling and he had the very mouth
fer a leetle poipe as Mrs Hogan admiringly remarked

He was hastily prepared for his trip and when I had arranged the
necessary business matters with his aunt and had assured her that she
could come to see him whenever she liked I got into the carriage and
having spread the laprobe over my knees the baby carefully wrapped in
a little shawl was laid in my lap Then his bottle freshly filled for
he might need a drink on the way was tucked between the cushions on the
seat beside me and taking the lines in my left hand while I steadied
my charge with the other I prepared to drive away

Whats his name I asked

Its Pat said his aunt afther his dad whos away in the moines

But ye kin call him onything ye bike Mrs Duffy remarked fer he
dont ansther to his name yit

Pat will do very well I said as I bade the good women farewell
and carefully guided the horse through the swarms of youngsters who had
gathered around the carriage



CHAPTER XX THE OTHER BABY AT RUDDER GRANGE


I drove slowly home and little Pat lay very quiet looking up steadily
at me with his twinkling blue eyes For a time everything went very
well but happening to look up I saw in the distance a carriage
approaching It was an open barouche and I knew it belonged to a family
of our acquaintance in the village and that it usually contained
ladies

Quick as thought I rolled up Pat in his shawl and stuffed him under the
seat Then rearranging the laprobe over my knees I drove on trembling
a little it is true

As I supposed the carriage contained ladies and I knew them all The
coachman instinctively drew up as we approached We always stopped and
spoke on such occasions

They asked me after my wife apparently surprised to see me alone and
made a number of pleasant observations to all of which I replied with
as unconcerned and easy an air as I could assume The ladies were in
excellent spirits but in spite of this there seemed to be an air of
repression about them which I thought of when I drove on but could not
account for for little Pat never moved or whimpered during the whole
of the interview

But when I took him again in my lap and happened to turn as I arranged
the robe I saw his bottle sticking up boldly by my side from between
the cushions Then I did not wonder at the repression

When I reached home I drove directly to the barn Fortunately Jonas
was there When I called him and handed little Pat to him I never saw
a man more utterly amazed He stood and held the child without a
word But when I explained the whole affair to him he comprehended it
perfectly and was delighted I think he was just as anxious for my plan
to work as I was myself although he did not say so

I was about to take the child into the house when Jonas remarked that
it was barefooted

That wont do I said It certainly had socks on when I got it I
saw them

Here they are said Jonas fishing them out from the shawl hes
kicked them off

Well we must put them on I said it wont do to take him in that
way You hold him

So Jonas sat down on the feedbox and carefully taking little Pat he
held him horizontally firmly pressed between his hands and knees with
his feet stuck out toward me while I knelt down before him and tried to
put on the little socks But the socks were knit or worked very loosely
and there seemed to be a good many small holes in them so that
Pats funny little toes which he kept curling up and uncurling were
continually making their appearance in unexpected places through the
sock But after a great deal of trouble I got them both on with the
heels in about the right places

Now they ought to be tied on I said Where are his garters

I dont believe babies have garters said Jonas doubtfully but I
could rig him up a pair

No said I we wont take the time for that Ill hold his legs apart
as I carry him in Its rubbing his feet together that gets them off

As I passed the kitchen window I saw Pomona at work She looked at me
dropped something and I heard a crash I dont know how much that crash
cost me Jonas rushed in to tell Pomona about it and in a moment I
heard a scream of laughter At this Euphemia appeared at an upper
window with her hand raised and saying severely Hushh But the
moment she saw me she disappeared from the window and came downstairs
on the run She met me just as I entered the diningroom

What IN the world she breathlessly exclaimed

This said I taking Pat into a better position in my arms is my
baby

Yourbaby said Euphemia Where did you get it what are you going
to do with it

I got it in New Dublin I replied and I want it to amuse and occupy
me while I am at home I havent anything else to do except things that
take me away from you

Oh said Euphemia

At this moment little Pat gave his first whimper Perhaps he felt the
searching glance that fell upon him from the lady in the middle of the
room

I immediately began to walk up and down the floor with him and to sing
to him I did not know any infant music but I felt sure that a
soothing tune was the great requisite and that the words were of small
importance So I started on an old Methodist tune which I remembered
very well and which was used with the hymn containing the lines


 Weak and wounded sick and sore


and I sang as soothingly as I could


 Little Patsy Watsy Satsy
 Does he feel a litty bad
 Me will send and get his bottle
 He shant have to crywywy


What an idiot said Euphemia laughing in spite of her vexation


 No we aint no idiotses
 What we wants a botty mik


So I sang as I walked to the kitchen door and sent Jonas to the barn
for the bottle

Pomona was in spasms of laughter in the kitchen and Euphemia was trying
her best not to laugh at all

Whos going to take care of it Id like to know she said as soon as
she could get herself into a state of severe inquiry


 Sometimes me and sometimes Jonas


I sang still walking up and down the room with a long slow step
swinging the baby from side to side very much as if it were grassseed
in a sieve and I were sowing it over the carpet

When the bottle came I took it and began to feed little Pat Perhaps
the presence of a critical and interested audience embarrassed us for
Jonas and Pomona were at the door with streaming eyes while Euphemia
stood with her handkerchief to the lower part of her face or it may
have been that I did not understand the management of bottles but at
any rate I could not make the thing work and the disappointed little
Pat began to cry just as the whole of our audience burst into a wild
roar of laughter

Here Give me that child cried Euphemia forcibly taking Pat and the
bottle from me Youll make it swallow the whole affair and Im sure
its mouths big enough

You really dont think she said when we were alone and little Pat
with his upturned blue eyes serenely surveying the features of the
good lady who knew how to feed him was placidly pulling away at his
indiarubber tube that I will consent to your keeping such a creature
as this in the house Why hes a regular little Paddy If you kept him
hed grow up into a hodcarrier

Good said I I never thought of that What a novel thing it would be
to witness the gradual growth of a hodcarrier Ill make him a little
hod now to begin with He couldnt have a more suitable toy

I was talking in earnest she said Take your baby and please carry
him home as quick as you can for I am certainly not going to take care
of him

Of course not said I Now that I see how its done Im going to do
it myself Jonas will mix his feed and I will give it to him He looks
sleepy now Shall I take him upstairs and lay him on our bed

No indeed cried Euphemia You can put him on a quilt on the floor
until after luncheon and then you must take him home

I laid the young Milesian on the folded quilt which Euphemia prepared
for him where he turned up his little pug nose to the ceiling and went
contentedly to sleep

That afternoon I nailed four legs on a small packingbox and made a
bedstead for him This with a pillow in the bottom of it was very
comfortable and instead of taking him home I borrowed in the evening
some baby nightclothes from Pomona and set about preparing Pat for the
night

This Euphemia would not allow but silently taking him from me she put
him to bed

Tomorrow she said you must positively take him away I wont stand
it And in our room too

I didnt talk in that way about the baby you adopted I said

To this she made no answer but went away to attend as usual to
Pomonas baby while its mother washed the dishes

That night little Pat woke up several times and made things unpleasant
by his wails On the first two occasions I got up and walked him about
singing impromptu lines to the tune of weak and wounded but the third
time Euphemia herself arose and declaring that that doleful tune was
a great deal worse than the babys crying silenced him herself and
arranging his couch more comfortably he troubled us no more

In the morning when I beheld the little pad of orange fur in the box
my heart almost misgave me but as the day wore on my courage rose
again and I gave myself up almost entirely to my new charge
composing a vast deal of blank verse while walking him up and down the
house

Euphemia scolded and scolded and said she would put on her hat and go
for the mother But I told her the mother was dead and that seemed to
be an obstacle She took a good deal of care of the child for she said
she would not see an innocent creature neglected even if it was
an incipient hodcarrier but she did not relax in the least in her
attention to Pomonas baby

The next day was about the same in regard to infantile incident but
on the day after I began to tire of my new charge and Pat on his
side seemed to be tired of me for he turned from me when I went to
take him up while he would hold out his hands to Euphemia and grin
delightedly when she took him

That morning I drove to the village and spent an hour or two there On
my return I found Euphemia sitting in our room with little Pat on her
lap I was astonished at the change in the young rascal He was dressed
from head to foot in a suit of clothes belonging to Pomonas baby the
glowing fuzz on his head was brushed and made as smooth as possible
while his little muslin sleeves were tied up with blue ribbon

I stood speechless at the sight

Dont he look nice said Euphemia standing him up on her knees It
shows what good clothes will do Im glad I helped Pomona make up so
many Hes getting ever so fond of me ze itty Patsy watsy See how
strong he is He can almost stand on his legs Look how he laughs Hes
just as cunning as he can be And oh I was going to speak about that
box I wouldnt have him sleep in that old packingbox There are little
wicker cradles at the storeI saw them last weekthey dont cost much
and you could bring one up in the carriage Theres the other baby
crying and I dont know where Pomona is Just you mind him a minute
please and out she ran

I looked out of the window The horse still stood harnessed to the
carriage as I had left him I saw Pats old shawl lying in a corner
I seized it and rolling him in it new clothes and all I hurried
downstairs climbed into the carriage hastily disposed Pat in my lap
and turned the horse The demeanor of the youngster was very different
from what it was when I first took him in my lap to drive away with him
There was no confiding twinkle in his eye no contented munching of his
little fists He gazed up at me with wild alarm and as I drove out of
the gate he burst forth into such a yell that Lord Edward came bounding
around the house to see what was the matter Euphemia suddenly appeared
at an upper window and called out to me but I did not hear what she
said I whipped up the horse and we sped along to New Dublin Pat soon
stopped crying but he looked at me with a tearstained and reproachful
visage

The good women of the settlement were surprised to see little Pat return
so soon

An wasnt he good said Mrs Hogan as she took him from my hands

Oh yes I said He was as good as he could be But I have no further
need of him

I might have been called upon to explain this statement had not the
whole party of women who stood around burst into wild expressions of
delight at Pats beautiful clothes

Oh jist look at em cried Mrs Duffy An see thim leetle
pittycoots thrimmed wid lace Oh an it was good in ye sir to give
him all thim an pay the foive dollars too

An Im glad hes back said the fostering aunt for I was a coomin
over to till ye that Ive been hearin from owle Pat his dad an hes
a coomin back from the moines and I dont know what hed a said if
hed found his leetle Pat was rinted But if ye iver want to borry him
for a whoile after owle Pats gone back ye kin have him rintfree
an its much obloiged I am to ye sir fur dressin him so foine

I made no encouraging remarks as to future transactions in this line
and drove slowly home

Euphemia met me at the door She had Pomonas baby in her arms We
walked together into the parlor

And so you have given up the little fellow that you were going to do so
much for she said

Yes I have given him up I answered

It must have been a dreadful trial to you she continued

Oh dreadful I replied

I suppose you thought he would take up so much of your time and
thoughts that we couldnt be to each other what we used to be didnt
you she said

Not exactly I replied I only thought that things promised to be
twice as bad as they were before

She made no answer to this but going to the back door of the parlor she
opened it and called Pomona When that young woman appeared Euphemia
stepped toward her and said Here Pomona take your baby

They were simple words but they were spoken in such a way that they
meant a good deal Pomona knew what they meant Her eyes sparkled and
as she went out I saw her hug her child to her breast and cover it
with kisses and then through the window I could see her running to
the barn and Jonas

Now then said Euphemia closing the door and coming toward me with
one of her old smiles and not a trace of preoccupation about her I
suppose you expect me to devote myself to you

I did expect it and I was not mistaken


Since these events a third baby has come to Rudder Grange It is not
Pomonas nor was it brought from New Dublin It is named after a little
one who died very young before this story was begun and the strangest
thing about it is that never for a moment does it seem to come between
Euphemia and myself
