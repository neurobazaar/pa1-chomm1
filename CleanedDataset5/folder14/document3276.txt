Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

PART VI ARTEMUS WARDS PANORAMA

ILLUSTRATED AS DELIVERED AT EGYPTIAN HALL LONDON

61 PREFATORY NOTE BY MELVILLE D LANDON

The fame of Artemus Ward culminated in his last lectures at
Egyptian Hall Piccadilly the final one breaking off
abruptly on the evening of the 23d of January 1867 That
night the great humorist bade farewell to the public and
retired from the stage to die His Mormon lectures were
immensely successful in England His fame became the talk
of journalists savants and statesmen Every one seemed to
be affected differently but every one felt and acknowledged
his power The Honorable Robert Lowe says Mr EP
HINGSTON Artemus Wards bosom friend attended the Mormon
lecture one evening and laughed as hilariously as any one
in the room The next evening Mr John Bright happened to
be present With the exception of one or two occasional
smiles he listened with GRAVE attention

The London Standard in describing his first lecture in
London aptly said Artemus dropped his jokes faster than
the meteors of last night succeeded each other in the sky
And there was this resemblance between the flashes of his
humor and the flights of the meteors that in each case one
looked for jokes or meteors but they always came just in
the place that one least expected to find them Half the
enjoyment of the evening lay to some of those present in
listening to the hearty cachinnation of the people who only
found out the jokes some two or three minutes after they
were made and who laughed apparently at some grave
statements of fact Reduced to paper the showmans jokes
are certainly not brilliant almost their whole effect lies
in their seeming impromptu character They are carefully
led up to of course but they are uttered as if they are
mere afterthoughts of which the speaker is hardly sure

His humor was so entirely fresh and unconventional that it
took his hearers by surprise and charmed them His failing
health compelled him to abandon the lecture after about
eight or ten weeks Indeed during that brief period he was
once or twice compelled to dismiss his audience Frequently
he sank into a chair and nearly fainted from the exertion of
dressing He exhibited the greatest anxiety to be at his
post at the appointed time and scrupulously exerted himself
to the utmost to entertain his auditors It was not because
he was sick that the public was to be disappointed or that
their enjoyment was to be diminished During the last few
weeks of his lecturegiving he steadily abstained from
accepting any of the numerous invitations he received Had
he lived through the following London fashionable season
there is little doubt that the room at the Egyptian Hall
would have been thronged nightly The English aristocracy
have a fine delicate sense of humor and the success
artistic and pecuniary of Artemus Ward would have
rivalled that of the famous Lord Dundreary There were
many stupid people who did not understand the fun of
Artemus Wards books There were many stupid people who did
not understand the fun of Artemus Wards lecture on the
Mormons Highly respectable peoplethe pride of their
parishwhen they heard of a lecture upon the Mormons
expected to see a solemn person full of old saws and new
statistics who would denounce the sin of polygamyand
rave without limit against Mormons These uncomfortable
Christians do not like humor They dread it as a certain
personage is said to dread holy water and for the same
reason that thieves fear policemenit finds them out When
these good idiots heard Artemus offer if they did not like
the lecture in Piccadilly to give them free tickets for the
same lecture in California when he next visited that
country they turned to each other indignantly and said
What use are tickets for California to US WE are not
going to California No we are too good too respectable
to go so far from home The man is a fool One of these
vestrymen complained to the doorkeeper and denounced the
lecturer as an impostorand said the wealthy
parishioner as for the panorama it is the worst painted
thing I ever saw

During the lecture Artemus was always as solemn as the
grave Sometimes he would seem to forget his audience and
stand for several seconds gazing intently at his panorama
Then he would start up and remark apologetically I am very
fond of looking at my pictures His dress was always the
sameevening toilet His manners were polished and his
voice gentle and hesitating Many who had read of the man
who spelled joke with a g looked for a smart old man with
a shrewd cock eye dressed in vulgar velvet and gold and
they were hardly prepared to see the accomplished gentleman
with slim physique and delicate white hands

The letters of Artemus Ward in Punch from the tomb of
Shakspeare and the London Tower had made him famous in
England and in his audience were the nobility of the realm
His first lecture in London was delivered at Egyptian Hall
on Tuesday November 13th 1866 The room used was that
which had been occupied by Mr Arthur Sketchley adjoining
the one in which Mr Arthur Smith formerly made his
appearances The stage with the curtain down had this
appearance while Artemus was delivering his prologue

Drawing of stage with curtain closed and eight footlights

Punctually at eight oclock he would step hesitatingly
before the audience and rubbing his hands bashfully
commence the lecture

62 THE EGYPTIAN HALL LECTURE

You are entirely welcome ladies and gentlemen to my little
pictureshop

I couldnt give you a very clear idea of the Mormonsand
Utahand the Plainsand the Rocky Mountainswithout
opening a pictureshopand therefore I open one

I dont expect to do great things herebut I have thought
that if I could make money enough to by me a passage to New
Zealand I should feel that I had not lived in vain

I dont want to live in vainId rather live in Margate
or here But I wish when the Egyptians built this hall they
had given it a little more ventilation

If you should be dissatisfied with anything here tonightI
will admit you all free in New Zealandif you will come to
me there for the orders Any respectable cannibal will tell
you where I live This shows that I have a forgiving
spirit

I really dont care for money I only travel round to see
the world and to exhibit my clothes These clothes I have
on were a great success in America

How often do large fortunes ruin young men I should like
to be ruined but I can get on very well as I am

I am not an Artist I dont paint myselfthough perhaps if
I were a middleaged single lady I shouldyet I have a
passion for picturesI have had a great many pictures
photographs taken of myself Some of them are very pretty
rather sweet to look at for a short timeand as I said
before I like them Ive always loved pictures

I could draw on wood at a very tender age When a mere
child I once drew a small cartload of raw turnips over a
wooden bridgethe people of the village noticed me I
drew their attention They said I had a future before me
Up to that time I had an idea it was behind me

Time passed on It always does by the way You may
possibly have noticed that Time passes onIt is a kind of
way Time has

I became a man I havent distinguished myself at all as an
artistbut I have always been more or less mixed up with
Art I have an uncle who takes photographsand I have a
servant whotakes anything he can get his hands on

When I was in RomeRome in New York State I meana
distinguished sculpist wanted to sculp me But I said No
I saw through the designing man My model once in his
handshe would have flooded the market with my busts and
I couldnt stand it to see everybody going round with a bust
of me Everybody would want one of courseand wherever I
should go I should meet the educated classes with my bust
taking it home to their families This would be more than
my modesty could standand I should have to return to
Americawhere my creditors are

I like Art I admire dramatic Artalthough I failed as an
actor

It was in my schoolboy days that I failed as an actor
Artemus made many attempts as an amateur actor but never
to his own satisfaction He was very fond of the society of
actors and actresses Their weaknesses amused him as much
as their talents excited his admiration One of his
favorite sayings was that the world was made up of men
women and the people on the stageThe play was Ruins
of PompeiiI played the Ruins It was not a very
successful performancebut it was better than the Burning
Mountain He was not good He was a bad Vesuvius

The remembrance often makes me askWhere are the boys of
my youthI assure you this is not a conundrumSome are
amongst you heresome in Americasome are in gaol

Hence arises a most touching questionWhere are the girls
of my youth Some are marriedsome would like to be

Oh my Maria Alas she married another They frequently
do I hope she is happybecause I am Spoken with a
sigh It was a joke which always told Artemus never
failed to use it in his Babes in the Wood lecture and the
Sixty Minutes in Africa as well as in the Mormon story
some people are not happy I have noticed that

A gentleman friend of mine came to me one day with tears in
his eyes I said Why these weeps He said he had a
mortgage on his farmand wanted to borrow 200 pounds I
lent him the moneyand he went away Some time after he
returned with more tears He said he must leave me for
ever I ventured to remind him of the 200 pounds he
borrowed He was much cut up I thought I would not be hard
upon himso I told him I would throw off one hundred
pounds He brightenedshook my handand saidOld
friendI wont allow you to outdo me in liberalityIll
throw off the other hundred

As a manager I was always rather more successful than as an
actor

Some years ago I engaged a celebrated Living American
Skeleton for a tour through Australia He was the thinnest
man I ever saw He was a splendid skeleton He didnt
weigh anything scarcelyand I said to myselfthe people of
Australia will flock to see this tremendous curiosity It
is a long voyageas you knowfrom New York to Melbourne
and to my utter surprise the skeleton had no sooner got out
to sea than he commenced eating in the most horrible manner
He had never been on the ocean beforeand he said it agreed
with himI thought soI never saw a man eat so much in
my life Beefmuttonporkhe swallowed them all like a
sharkand between meals he was often discovered behind
barrels eating hardboiled eggs The result was that when
we reached Melbourne this infamous skeleton weighed 64
pounds more than I did

I thought I was ruinedbut I wasnt I took him on to
Californiaanother very long sea voyageand when I got him
to San Francisco I exhibited him as a Fat Man The reader
need scarcely be informed that this narrative is about as
real as A Wards Snaiks and about as much matter of fact
as his journey through the States with a waxwork show

This story hasnt anything to do with my Entertainment I
knowbut one of the principal features of my Entertainment
is that it contains so many things that dont have anything
to do with it

My Orchestra is smallbut I am sure it is very goodso far
as it goes I give my pianist ten pounds a nightand his
washing That a good pianist could be hired for a small
sum in England was a matter of amusement to Artemus More
especially when he found a gentleman obliging enough to play
anything he desired such as breakdowns and airs which had
the most absurd relation to the scene they were used to
illustrate In the United States his pianist was desirous
of playing music of a superior order much against the
consent of the lecturer

I like MusicI cant sing As a singist I am not a
success I am saddest when I sing So are those who hear
me They are sadder even than I am

The other night some silvervoiced young men came under my
window and sangCome where my love lies dreamingI
didnt go I didnt think it would be correct

I found music very soothing when I lay ill with fever in
Utahand I was very illI was fearfully wastedMy face
was hewn down to nothingand my nose was so sharp I didnt
dare to stick it into other peoples businessfor fear it
would stay thereand I should never get it again And on
those dismal days a Mormon ladyshe was marriedtho not
so much so as her husbandhe had fifteen other wivesshe
used to sing a ballad commencing Sweet birddo not fly
awayand I told her I wouldntShe played the accordion
divinelyaccordionly I praised her

I met a man in Oregon who hadnt any teethnot a tooth in
his headyet that man could play on the bass drum better
than any man I ever metHe kept a hotel They have queer
hotels in Oregon I remember one where they gave me a bag
of oats for a pillowI had nightmares of course In the
morning the landlord saidHow do you feelold hosshay
I told him I felt my oats

Though the serious part of the lecture was here entered
upon it was not delivered in a graver tone than that in
which he had spoken the farcicalities of the prologue Most
of the prefatory matter was given with an air of earnest
thought the arms sometimes folded and the chin resting on
one hand On the occasion of his first exhibiting the
panorama at New York he used a fishingrod to point out the
picture with subsequently he availed himself of an old
umbrella In the Egyptian Hall he used his little
ridingwhip

Permit me now to quietly state that altho I am here with my
cap and bells I am also here with some serious descriptions
of the Mormonstheir mannerstheir customsand while the
pictures I shall present to your notice are by no means
works of artthey are painted from photographs actually
taken on the spot They were photographed by Savage 
Ottinger of Salt Lake City the photographers to Brigham
Youngand I am sure I need not inform any person present
who was ever in the territory of Utah that they are as
faithful as they could possibly be CurtainThe picture
was concealed from view during the first part of the lecture
by a crimson curtain This was drawn together or opened
many times in the course of the lecture and at odd points
of the lecture I am not aware that Artemus himself could
have explained why he caused the curtain to be drawn at one
place and not at another Probably he thought it to be one
of his good jokes that it should shut in the picture just
when there was no reason for its being used

I went to Great Salt Lake City by way of California That
is he went by steamer from New York to Aspinwall thence
across the Isthmus of Panama by railway and then from
Panama to California by another steamboat A journey which
then occupied about three weeks

I went to California on the steamer Ariel

This is the steamer Ariel Picture

Oblige me by calmly gazing on the steamer Arieland when
you go to California be sure and go on some other steamer
because the Ariel isnt a very good one

When I reached the Arielat pier No 4New YorkI found
the passengers in a state of great confusion about their
thingswhich were being thrown around by the ships porters
in a manner at once damaging and idioticSo great was the
excitementmy fragile form was smashed this wayand jammed
that waytill finally I was shoved into a stateroom which
was occupied by two middleaged femaleswho said Base
manleave usO leave usI left themOhI left them

We reach Acapulco on the coast of Mexico in due time
Nothing of special interest occurred at Acapulcoonly some
of the Mexican ladies are very beautiful They all have
brilliant black hairhair black as starless nightif I
may quote from the Family Herald It dont curlA
Mexican ladys hair never curlsit is straight as an
Indians Some peoples hair wont curl under any
circumstancesMy hair wont curl under two shillings
Artemus always wore his hair straight until his severe
illness in Salt Lake City So much of it dropped off during
his recovery that he became dissatisfied with the long
meagre appearance his countenance presented when he surveyed
it in the lookingglass After his lecture at the Salt Lake
City Theatre he did not lecture again until we had crossed
the Rocky Mountains and arrived at Denver City the capital
of Colorado On the afternoon he was to lecture there I met
him coming out of an ironmongers store with a small parcel
in his hand I want you old fellow he said I have
been all around the city for them and Ive got them at
last Got what I asked A pair of curlingtongs I
am going to have my hair curled to lecture in tonight I
mean to cross the plains in curls Come home with me and
try to curl it for me I dont want to go to any idiot of a
barber to be laughed at I played the part of friseur
Subsequently he became his own curlist as he phrased it
From that day forth Artemus was a curlyhaired man

Picture of The great thoroughfare of the imperial city of
the Pacific Coast with a sign saying Artemus Ward Platts
Hall every evening

The Chinese form a large element in the population of San
Franciscoand I went to the Chinese Theatre

A Chinese play often lasts two months Commencing at the
heros birth it is cheerfully conducted from week to week
till he is either killed or married

The night I was there a Chinese comic vocalist sang a
Chinese comic song It took him six weeks to finish itbut
as my time was limited I went away at the expiration of 215
verses There were 11000 verses to this songthe chorus
being Tural lural dural ri fol daywhich was repeated
twice at the end of each versemakingas you will at once
seethe appalling number of 22000 tural lural dural ri
fol daysand the man still lives

Picture of Virginia Cityin the bright new State of
Nevada Virginia City itself is built on a ledge cut out
of the side of Mount Davidson which rises some 9000 feet
above the sea levelthe city being about half way up its
side To Artemus Ward the wild character of the scenery
the strange manners of the redshirted citizens and the
odd developments of the life met with in that uncouth
mountaintown were all replete with interest We stayed
there about a week During the time of our stay he explored
every part of the place met many old friends from the Eastern
States and formed many new acquaintances with some of whom
acquaintance ripened into warm friendship Among the latter
was Mr Samuel L Clemens now well known as Mark Twain
He was then subediting one of the three papers published
daily in VirginiaThe Territorial Enterprise Artemus
detected in the writings of Mark Twain the indications of
great humorous power and strongly advised the writer to
seek a better field for his talents Since then he has
become a wellknown lecturer and author With Mark Twain
Artemus made a descent into the Gould and Curry Silver Mine
at Virginia the largest mine of the kind I believe in the
world The account of the descent formed a long and very
amusing article in the next mornings Enterprise To
wander about the town and note its strange developments
occupied Artemus incessantly I was sitting writing letters
at the hotel when he came in hurriedly and requested me to
go out with him Come and see some joking much better than
mine said he He led me to where one of Wells Fargo 
Cos express wagons was being rapidly filled with silver
bricks Ingots of the precious metal each almost as large
as an ordinary brick were being thrown from one man to
another to load the wagon just as bricks or cheeses are
transferred from hand to hand by carters in England Good
old jokes those Hingston Good solid Babes in the Wood
observed Artemus Yet that evening he lectured in
Maguires Opera House Virginia City to an audience
composed chiefly of miners and the receipts were not far
short of eight hundred dollars

A wonderful little cityright in the heart of the famous
Washoe silver regionsthe mines of which annually produce
over twentyfive millions of solid silver This silver is
melted into solid bricksabout the size of ordinary
housebricksand carted off to San Francisco with mules
The roads often swarm with these silver wagons

One hundred and seventyfive miles to the east of this place
are the Reese River Silver Mineswhich are supposed to be
the richest in the world

Pointing to Panorama

is so frightfully gloomy always No treesno housesno

showing a carcass attended by various scavengers with a
building and mountains in the distance

This picture is a great work of artIt is an oil painting
done in petroleum It is by the Old Masters It was the
last thing they did before dying They did this and then
they expired

The most celebrated artists of London are so delighted with
this picture that they come to the Hall every day to gaze at
it I wish you were nearer to itso you could see it
better I wish I could take it to your residences and let
you see it by daylight Some of the greatest artists in
London come here every morning before daylight with lanterns
to look at it They say they never saw anything like it
beforeand they hope they never shall again

When I first showed this picture in New York the audience
were so enthusiastic in their admiration of this picture
that they called for the Artistand when he appeared they
threw brickbats at him This portion of the panorama was
very badly painted When the idea of having a panorama was
first entertained by Artemus he wished to have one of great
artistic merit Finding considerable difficulty in
procuring one and also discovering that the expense of a
real work of art would be beyond his means he resolved on
having a very bad one or one so bad in parts that its very
badness would give him scope for jest In the small towns
of the Western States it passed very well for a firstclass
picture but what it was really worth in an artistic point
of view its owner was very well aware

Next picture A birdseye view of Great Salt Lake City
the strange city in the Desert about which so much has been
heardthe city of the people who call themselves Saints

I know there is much interest taken in these remarkable
peopleladies and gentlemenand I have thought it better
to make the purely descriptive part of my Entertainment
entirely seriousI will notthenfor the next ten
minutesconfine myself to my subject

Some seventeen years ago a small band of Mormonsheaded by
Brigham Youngcommenced in the present thrifty metropolis
of Utah The population of the territory of Utah is over
100000chiefly Mormonsand they are increasing at the
rate of from five to ten thousand annually The converts to
Mormonism now are almost exclusively confined to English and
GermansWales and Cornwall have contributed largely to the
population of Utah during the last few years The
population of Great Salt Lake City is 20000The streets
are eight rods wideand are neither flagged nor paved A
stream of pure mountain spring water courses through each
streetand is conducted into the Gardens of the Mormons
The houses are mostly of adobeor sundried brickand
present a neat and comfortable appearanceThey are usually
a story and a half high Now and then you see a fine modern
house in Salt Lake Citybut no house that is dirty shabby
and dilapidatedbecause there are no absolutely poor people
in Utah Every Mormon has a nice gardenand every Mormon
has a tidy dooryardNeatness is a great characteristic of
the Mormons

The Mormons profess to believe that they are the chosen
people of Godthey call themselves Latterday Saintsand
they call us people of the outer world Gentiles They say
that Mr Brigham Young is a prophetthe legitimate
successor of Joseph Smithwho founded the Mormon religion
They also say they are authorizedby special revelation
from Heavento marry as many wives as they can comfortably
support

This wifesystem they call pluralitythe world calls it
polygamy That at its best it is an accursed thingI need
not of course inform youbut you will bear in mind that I
am here as a rather cheerful reporter of what I saw in Utah
and I fancy it isnt at all necessary for me to grow
virtuously indignant over something we all know is hideously
wrong

You will be surprised to hearI was amazed to seethat
among the Mormon women there are some few persons of
educationof positive cultivation As a class the Mormons
are not educated peoplebut they are by no means the
community of ignoramuses so many writers have told us they
were

The valley in which they live is splendidly favored They
raise immense crops They have mills of all kinds They
have coalleadand silver mines All they eatall they
drinkall they wear they can produce themselvesand still
have a great abundance to sell to the gold regions of Idaho
on the one handand the silver regions of Nevada on the
other

The President of this remarkable communitythe head of the
Mormon Churchis Brigham YoungHe is called President
Youngand Brother Brigham He is about 54 years old
altho he doesnt look to be over 45 He has sandy hair and
whiskersis of medium heightand is a little inclined to
corpulency He was born in the State of Vermont His power
is more absolute than that of any living sovereignyet he
uses it with such consummate discretion that his people are
almost madly devoted to himand that they would cheerfully
die for him if they thought the sacrifice were demandedI
cannot doubt

He is a man of enormous wealthOnetenth of everything
sold in the territory of Utah goes to the Churchand Mr
Brigham Young is the Church It is supposed that he
speculates with these fundsat all eventshe is one of the
wealthiest men now livingworth several millionswithout
doubtHe is a boldbad manbut that he is also a man of
extraordinary administrative ability no one can doubt who
has watched his astounding career for the past ten years
It is only fair for me to add that he treated me with marked
kindness during my sojourn in Utah

Picture of West Side of Main Street Salt Lake City A
wagon and team stand outside the City Bathing House and a
pennant flies over the temperance hotel

The West Side of Main StreetSalt Lake Cityincluding a
view of the Salt Lake Hotel It is a temperance hotel At
the date of our visit there was only one place in Salt Lake
City where strong drink was allowed to be sold Brigham
Young himself owned the property and vended the liquor by
wholesale not permitting any of it to be drunk on the
premises It was a coarse inferior kind of whisky known
in Salt Lake as Valley Tan Throughout the city there was
no drinkingbar nor billiard room so far as I am aware
But a drink on the sly could always be had at one of the
hardgoods stores in the back office behind the pile of
metal saucepans or at one of the drygoods stores in the
little parlor in the rear of the bales of calico At the
present time I believe that there are two or three open bars
in Salt Lake Brigham Young having recognized the right of
the Saints to liquor up occasionally But whatever
other failings they may have intemperance cannot be laid to
their charge Among the Mormons there are no paupers no
gamblers and no drunkards I prefer temperance hotels
altho they sell worse liquor than any other kind of hotels
But the Salt Lake Hotel sells nonenor is there a bar in
all Salt Lake Citybut I found when I was thirstyand I
generally amthat I could get some very good brandy of one
of the Elderson the slyand I never on any account allow
my business to interfere with my drinking

Picture of The Overland Mail CoachThat is the den on
wheels in which we have been crammed for the past ten days
and ten nightsThose of you who have been in Newgate The
manner in which Artemus uttered this joke was peculiarly
characteristic of his style of lecturing The commencement
of the sentence was spoken as if unpremeditated then when
he had got as far as the word Newgate he paused as if
wishing to call back that which he had said The applause
was unfailingly uproarious
and stayed there any length of
timeas visitorscan realize how I felt

The American Overland Mail Route commences at Sacramento
Californiaand ends at AtchisonKansas The distance is
two thousand two hundred milesbut you go part of the way
by rail The Pacific Railway is now completed from
SacramentoCaliforniato FulsomCaliforniawhich only
leaves two thousand two hundred and eleven miles to go by
coach This breaks the monotonyit came very near breaking
my back

Picture of The Mormon Theatre

This edifice is the exclusive property of Brigham Young It
will comfortably hold 3000 personsand I beg you will
believe me when I inform you that its interior is quite as
brilliant as that of any theatre in London Herein Artemus
slightly exaggerated The coloring of the theatre was white
and gold but it was inefficiently lighted with oil lamps
When Brigham Young himself showed us round the theatre he
pointed out as an instance of his own ingenuity that the
central chandelier was formed out of the wheel of one of his
old coaches The house is now I believe lighted with gas
Altogether it is a very wondrous edifice considering where
it is built and who were the builders

The actors are all Mormon amateurs who charge nothing for
their services

You must know that very little money is taken at the doors
of this theatre The Mormons mostly pay in grainand all
sorts of articles

The night I gave my little lecture thereamong my receipts
were cornflourporkcheesechickenson foot and in the
shell

One family went in on a live pigand a man attempted to
pass a yaller dog at the Box Officebut my agent repulsed
him One offered me a doll for admissionanother infants
clothingI refused to take thatAs a general rule I do
refuse

In the middle of the parquetin a rocking chairwith his
hat onsits Brigham Young When the play dragshe either
goes out or falls into a tranquil sleep

A portion of the dresscircle is set apart for the wives of
Brigham Young From ten to twenty of them are usually
present His children fill the entire galleryand more
too

The East Side of Main StreetSalt Lake Citywith a view of
the Council BuildingThe legislature of Utah meets there
It is like all legislative bodies They meet this winter to
repeal the laws which they met and made last winterand
they will meet next winter to repeal the laws which they met
and made this winter

I dislike to speak about itbut it was in Utah that I made
the great speech of my life I wish you could have heard
it I have a fine education You may have noticed it I
speak six different languagesLondonChathamand Dover
MargateBrightonand Hastings My parents sold a cow
and sent me to college when I was quite young During the
vacation I used to teach a school of whalesand theres
where I learned to spoutI dont expect applause for a
little thing like that I wish you could have heard that
speechhowever If Cicerohes dead nowhe has gone
from usbut if old Ciss Here again no description can
adequately inform the reader of the drollery which
characterized the lecturer His reference to Cicero was
made in the most lugubrious manner as if he really deplored
his death and valued him as a schoolfellow loved and lost
could have heard that effort it would have given him the
rinderpest Ill tell you how it was There are stationed
in Utah two regiments of US troopsthe 21st from
Californiaand the 37th from Nevada The 20onesters asked
me to present a stand of colors to the 37stersand I did
it in a speech so abounding in eloquence of a bold and
brilliant characterand also some sweet talkreal pretty
shopkeeping talkthat I worked the enthusiasm of those
soldiers up to such a pitchthat they came very near
shooting me on the spot

Picture of Brigham Youngs HaremThese are the houses of
Brigham Young The first on the right is the Lion Houseso
called because a crouching stone lion adorns the central
front window The adjoining small building is Brigham
Youngs officeand where he receives his visitorsThe
large house in the centre of the picturewhich displays a
huge beehiveis called the Bee Housethe beehive is
supposed to be symbolical of the industry of the Mormons
Mrs Brigham Young the firstnow quite an old ladylives
here with her children None of the other wives of the
prophet live here In the rear are the schoolhouses where
Brigham Youngs children are educated

Brigham Young has two hundred wives Just think of that
Oblige me by thinking of that That ishe has eighty
actual wives and he is spiritually married to one hundred
and twenty more These spiritual marriagesas the Mormons
call themare contracted with aged widowswho think it a
great honor to be sealedthe Mormons call it being sealed
to the Prophet

So we may say he has two hundred wives He loves not
wiselybut two hundred well He is dreadfully married
Hes the most married man I ever saw in my life

I saw his motherinlaw while I was there I cant exactly
tell you how many there is of herbut its a good deal It
strikes me that one motherinlaw is about enough to have in
a familyunless youre very fond of excitement

A few days before my arrival in UtahBrigham was married
againto a young and really pretty girlbut he says he
shall stop now He told me confidentially that he shouldnt
get married any more He says that all he wants now is to
live in peace for the remainder of his daysand have his
dying pillow soothed by the loving hands of his family
Wellthats all rightthats all rightI supposebut if
ALL his family soothe his dying pillowhell have to go
outdoors to die

By the wayShakespeare indorses polygamyHe speaks of the
Merry Wives of Windsor How many wives did Mr Windsor
havebut we will let this pass

Some of these Mormons have terrific families I lectured
one night by invitation in the Mormon village of Provost
but during the day I rashly gave a leading Mormon an order
admitting himself and familyit was before I knew that he
was much marriedand they filled the room to overflowing
It was a great successbut I didnt get any money

Picture of Heber C Kimballs HaremMr C Kimball is
the first vicepresident of the Mormon churchand would
consequentlysucceed to the full presidency on Brigham
Youngs death

Brother Kimball is a gay and festive cuss of some seventy
summersor someers thereabout He has one thousand head
of cattle and a hundred head of wives It is an
authenticated fact that in an address to his congregation
in the Tabernacle Heber C Kimball once alluded to his
wives by the endearing epithet of my heifers and on
another occasion politely spoke of them as his cows The
phraseology may possibly be a slight indication of the
refinement of manners prevalent in Salt Lake City He says
they are awful eaters

Mr Kimball had a sona lovely young manwho was married
to ten interesting wives But one daywhile he was absent
from homethese ten wives went out walking with a handsome
young manwhich so enraged Mr Kimballs sonwhich made
Mr Kimballs son so jealousthat he shot himself with a
horse pistuel

The doctor who attended hima very scientific maninformed
me that the bullet entered the inner parallelogram of his
diaphragmatic thorax superinducing membranous hemorrhage in
the outer cuticle of his basiliconthamaturgist It killed
him I should have thought it would

Soft music Here Artemus Wards pianist following
instructions sometimes played the dead march from Saul
At other times the Welsh air of Poor Mary Anne or
anything else replete with sadness which might chance to
strike his fancy The effect was irresistibly comic

I hope his sad end will be a warning to all young wives who
go out walking with handsome young men Mr Kimballs son
is now no more He sleeps beneath the cypressthe myrtle
and the willow This music is a dirge by the eminent
pianist for Mr Kimballs son He died by request

I regret to say that efforts were made to make a Mormon of
me while I was in Utah

It was leapyear when I was thereand seventeen young
widowsthe wives of a deceased Mormonoffered me their
hearts and hands I called on them one dayand taking
their soft white hands in minewhich made eighteen hands
altogetherI found them in tears

And I saidWhy is this thus What is the reason of this
thusness

They hove a sighseventeen sighs of different sizeThey
said

Ohsoon thou wilt be gonested away

I told them that when I got ready to leave a place I
wentested

They saidDoth not like us

I saidI dothI doth

I also saidI hope your intentions are honorableas I am
a lone childmy parents being farfar away

They then saidWilt not marry us

I saidOhnoit cannot was

Again they asked me to marry themand again I declined
When they cried

Ohcruel man This is too muchoh too much

I told them that it was on account of the muchness that I
declined

Picture This is the Mormon Temple

It is built of adobeand will hold five thousand persons
quite comfortably A full brass and string band often
assists the choir of this churchand the choirI may add
is a remarkably good one

Brigham Young seldom preaches now The younger elders
unless on some special occasionconduct the services I
only heard Mr Young once He is not an educated manbut
speaks with considerable force and clearness The day I was
there there was nothing coarse in his remarks

Picture of The foundations of the Temple

These are the foundations of the magnificent Temple the
Mormons are building It is to be built of hewn stoneand
will cover several acres of ground They say it shall
eclipse in splendor all other temples in the world They
also say it shall be paved with solid gold

It is perhaps worthy of remark that the architect of this
contemplated gorgeous affair repudiated Mormonismand is
now living in London

Picture of The Temple as it is to be

This pretty little picture is from the architects design
and cannot thereforeI supposebe called a fancy sketch
Artemus had the windows of the temple in his panorama cut
out and filled in with transparent colored paper so that
when lighted from behind it had the effect of one of the
little plaster churches with a piece of lighted candle
inside which the Italian imageboys display at times for
sale in the streets Nothing in the course of the evening
pleased Artemus more than to notice the satisfaction with
which this meretricious piece of absurdity was received by
the audience

Should the Mormons continue unmolestedI think they will
complete this rather remarkable edifice

Picture of the Great Salt Lake

Great Salt LakeThe great salt dead sea of the desert

I know of no greater curiosity than this inland sea of thick
brine It is eighty miles wideand one hundred and thirty
miles long Solid masses of salt are daily washed ashore in
immense heapsand the Mormon in want of salt has only to go
to the shore of this lake and fill his cart Onlythe salt
for table use has to be subjected to a boiling process

These are factssusceptible of the clearest possible proof
They tell one story about this lakehoweverthat I have my
doubts about They say a Mormon farmer drove forty head of
cattle in there onceand they came out firstrate pickled
beef

     

     

     

I sincerely hope you will excuse my absenceI am a man
shortand have to work the moon myself Here Artemus
would leave the rostrum for a few moments and pretend to be
engaged behind The picture was painted for a nightscene
and the effect intended to be produced was that of the moon
rising over the lake and rippling on the waters It was
produced in the usual dioramic way by making the track of
the moon transparent and throwing the moon on from the
bulls eye of the lantern When Artemus went behind the
moon would become nervous and flickering dancing up and
down in the most inartistic and undecided manner The
result was that coupled with the lecturers oddly expressed
apology the moon became one of the best laughedat parts
of the entertainment

I shall be most happy to pay a good salary to any
respectable boy of good parentage and education who is a
good moonist

Picture of The Endowment House

In this building the Mormon is initiated into the mysteries
of the faith

Strange stories are told of the proceedings which are held
in this buildingbut I have no possible means of knowing
how true they may be

Salt Lake City is fiftyfive miles behind usand this is
Echo Canyonin reaching which we are supposed to have
crossed the summit of the Wahsatch Mountains These
ochrecolored bluffsformed of conglomerate sandstoneand
full of fossilssignal the entrance to the Canyon At its
base lies Weber Station

Echo Canyon is about twentyfive miles long It is really
the sublimest thing between the Missouri and the Sierra
Nevada The red wall to the left develops farther up the
Canyon into pyramidsbuttressesand castleshoneycombed
and fretted in natures own massive magnificence of
architecture

In 1856Echo Canyon was the place selected by Brigham Young
for the Mormon General Wells to fortify and make impregnable
against the advance of the American armyled by General
Albert Sidney Johnson It was to have been the Thermopylae
of Mormondombut it wasnt general Wells was to have done
Leonidasbut he didnt

Picture of Echo Canyon

The wild snowstorms have left usand we have thrown our
wolfskin overcoats aside Certain tribes of farwestern
Indians bury their distinguished dead by placing them high
in air and covering them with valuable fursthat is a very
fair representation of these midair tombs Those animals
are horsesI know they arebecause my artist says so I
had the picture two years before I discovered the factThe
artist came to me about six months agoand saidIt is
useless to disguise it from you any longerthey are
horses

Picture of A more cheerful view of the Desert

It was while crossing this desert that I was surrounded by a
band of Ute Indians They were splendidly mountedthey
were dressed in beaverskinsand they were armed with
riflesknivesand pistols

Picture of Our Encounter with the Indians

What could I doWhat could a poor old orphan do Im a
brave manThe day before the Battle of Bulls Run I stood
in the highway while the bulletsthose dreadful messengers
of deathwere passing all around me thicklyIN WAGONSon
their way to the battlefield This was the great joke of
Artemus Wards first lecture The Babes in the Wood He
never omitted it in any of his lectures nor did it lose its
power to create laughter by repetition The audiences at
the Egyptian Hall London laughed as immoderately at it as
did those of Irving Hall New York or of the Tremont Temple
in Boston But there were too many of these Injunsthere
were forty of themand only one of meand so I said

Great ChiefI surrender His name was Wockybocky

He dismountedand approached me I saw his tomahawk
glisten in the morning sunlight Fire was in his eye
Wockybocky came very close to me and seized me by the hair
of my head He mingled his swarthy fingers with my golden
tressesand he rubbed his dreadful Thomashawk across my
lilywhite face He said

Torsha arrah darrah mishky bookshean

I told him he was right

Wockybocky again rubbed his tomahawk across my face and
saidWinkholooboo

Says IMr Wockybockysays IWockyI have thought so
for yearsand sos all our family

He told me I must go to the tent of the StrongHeart and eat
raw dog While sojourning for a day in a camp of Sioux
Indians we were informed that the warriors of the tribe were
accustomed to eat raw dog to give them courage previous to
going to battle Artemus was greatly amused with the
information When in after years he became weak and
languid and was called upon to go to lecture it was a
favorite joke with him to inquire Hingston have you got
any raw dog It dont agree with me I prefer simple
food I prefer porkpiebecause then I know what Im
eating But as raw dog was all they proposed to give to me
I had to eat it or starve So at the expiration of two days
I seized a tin plate and went to the chiefs daughterand I
said to her in a silvery voicein a kind of Germansilvery
voiceI said

Sweet child of the forest the paleface wants his dog

There was nothing but his paws I had paused too long
Which reminds me that time passes A way which time has

I was told in my youth to seize opportunity I once tried
to seize one He was rich He had diamonds on As I seized
himhe knocked me down Since then I have learned that he
who seizes opportunity sees the penitentiary

Picture of The Rocky Mountains

I take it for granted you have heard of these popular
mountains In America they are regarded as a great success
and we all love dearly to talk about them It is a kind of
weakness with us I never knew but one American who hadnt
somethingsome timeto say about the Rocky Mountainsand
he was a deaf and dumb man who couldnt say anything about
nothing

But these mountainswhose summits are snowcovered and icy
all the year roundare too grand to make fun of I crossed
them in the winter of 64in a rough sleigh drawn by four
mules

This sparkling waterfall is the LaughingWater alluded to by
Mr Longfellow in his Indian poemHigherWater The
water is higher up there

 Music

Picture of The plains of Colorado

These are the dreary plains over which we rode for so many
weary days An affecting incident occurred on these plains
some time since which I am sure you will pardon me for
introducing here

On a beautiful June morningsome sixteen years ago

 Music very loud till the scene is off

     

     

     

and she fainted on Reginalds breast At this part of
the lecture Artemus pretended to tell a storythe piano
playing loudly all the time He continued his narration in
excited dumbshowhis lips moving as though he were
speaking For some minutes the audience indulged in
unrestrained laughter

Picture of The Prairie on Fire

A prairie on fire is one of the wildest and grandest sights
that can be possibly imagined

These fires occurof coursein the summerwhen the grass
is dry as tinderand the flames rush and roar over the
prairie in a manner frightful to behold They usually burn
better than mine is burning tonight I try to make my
prairie burn regularlyand not disappoint the publicbut
it is not as highprincipled as I am The scene was a
transparent onethe light from behind so managed as to give
the effect of the prairie on fire Artemus enjoyed the joke
of letting the fire go out occasionally and then allowing
it to relight itself

Picture of Brigham Young at home

The last picture I have to show you represents Mr Brigham
Young in the bosom of his family His family is largeand
the olive branches around his table are in a very tangled
condition He is more a father than any man I know When
at homeas you here see himhe ought to be very happy with
sixty wives to minister to his comfortsand twice sixty
children to soothe his distracted mind Ah my friends
what is home without a family

What will become of Mormonism We all know and admit it to
be a hideous wronga great immoral strain upon the
scutcheon of the United States My belief is that its
existence is dependent upon the life of Brigham Young His
administrative ability holds the system togetherhis power
of will maintains it as the faith of a community When he
diesMormonism will die too The men who are around him
have neither his talent nor his energy By means of his
strength it is held together When he fallsMormonism will
also fall to pieces

That lionyou perceivehas a tail It is a long one
already Like mineit is to be continued in our next

Reprise of first picture of curtain and footlights

The curtain fell for the last time on Wednesday the 23d of
January 1867 Artemus Ward had to break off the lecture
abruptly He never lectured again

63 THE TIMES NOTICE

EGYPTIAN HALLBefore a large audience comprising an
extraordinary number of literary celebrities Mr Artemus
Ward the noted American humorist made his first appearance
as a public lecturer on Tuesday evening the place selected
for the display of his quaint oratory being the room long
tenanted by Mr Arthur Sketchley His first entrance on the
platform was the signal for loud and continuous laughter and
applause denoting a degree of expectation which a nervous
man might have feared to encounter However his first
sentences and the way in which they were received amply
sufficed to prove that his success was certain The dialect
of Artemus bears a less evident mark of the Western World
than that of many American actors who would fain merge
their own peculiarities in the delineation of English
character but his jokes are of that true Transatlantic
type to which no nation beyond the limits of the States can
offer any parallel These jokes he lets fall with an air of
profound unconsciousnesswe may almost say melancholy
which is irresistibly droll aided as it is by the effect of
a figure singularly gaunt and lean and a face to match And
he has found an audience by whom his caustic humor is
thoroughly appreciated Not one of the odd pleasantries
slipped out with such imperturbable gravity misses its mark
and scarcely a minute elapses at the end of which the sedate
Artemus is not forced to pause till the roar of mirth has
subsided There is certainly this foundation for an entente
cordiale between the two countries calling themselves Anglo
Saxon that the Englishman puzzled by Yankee politics
thoroughly relishes Yankee jokes though they are not in the
least like his own When two persons laugh together they
cannot hate each other much so long as the laugh continues

The subject of Artemus Wards lecture is a visit to the
Mormons copiously illustrated by a series of moving
pictures not much to be commended as works of art but for
the most part well enough executed to give fidelity
granted a notion of life as it is among the remarkable
inhabitants of Utah Nor let the connoisseur who detects
the shortcomings of some of these pictures fancy that he
has discovered a flaw in the armor of the doughty Artemus
That astute gentleman knows their worth as well as anybody
else and while he ostensibly extols them as a showman is
bound to do he every now and then holds them up to ridicule
in a vein of the deepest irony In one case a palpable
error of perspective by which a man is made equal in size
to a mountain has been purposely committed and the shouts
of laughter that arise as soon as the ridiculous picture
appears is tremendous But there is no mirth in the face of
Artemus he seems even deaf to the roar and when he
proceeds to the explanation of the landscape he touches on
the ridiculous point in a slurring way that provokes a new
explosion

The particulars of the lecture we need not describe Many
accounts of the Mormons more or less credible and all
authenticated have been given by serious historians and
Mr WH Dixon who has just returned from Utah to London
is said to have brought with him new stores of solid
information But to most of us Mormonism is still a
mystery and under those circumstances a lecturer who has
professedly visited a country for the sake more of picking
up fun than of sifting facts and whose chief object it must
be to make his narrative amusing can scarcely be accepted
as an authority We will therefore content ourselves with
stating that the lecture is entertaining to such a degree
that to those who seek amusement its brevity is its only
fault that it is utterly free from offence though the
opportunities for offence given by the subject of Mormonism
are obviously numerous that it is interspersed not only
with irresistible jokes but with shrewd remarks proving
that Artemus Ward is a man of reflection as well as a
consummate humorist

being only one Pauline in it The play was revised at once
It was presented the next night with fifteen Paulines in
the cast and was a perfect success  All these
statements may be regarded as strictly true Mr Ward would
not deceive an infant

RECOMMENDATIONS

 TOTNESS Oct 20th 1866

MR ARTEMUS WARD

My dear SirMy wife was dangerously unwell for over
sixteen years She was so weak that she could not lift a
teaspoon to her mouth But in a fortunate moment she
commenced reading one of your lectures She got better at
once She gained strength so rapidly that she lifted the
cottage piano quite a distance from the floor and then
tipped it over on to her motherinlaw with whom she had
some little trouble We like your lectures very much
Please send me a barrel of them If you should require any
more recommendations you can get any number of them in this
place at two shillings each the price I charge for this
one and I trust you may be ever happy

 I am Sir
 Yours truly and so is my wife

An American correspondent of a distinguished journal in
Yorkshire thus speaks of Mr WARDS power as an Orator

It was a grand scene Mr ARTEMUS WARD standing on the
platform talking many of the audience sleeping tranquilly
in their seats others leaving the room and not returning
others crying like a child at some of the jokesall all
formed a most impressive scene and showed the powers of
this remarkable orator And when he announced that he
should never lecture in that town again the applause was
absolutely deafening
