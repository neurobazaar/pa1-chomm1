AN OLDFASHIONED GIRL

By Louisa M Alcott




Preface

AS a preface is the only place where an author can with propriety
explain a purpose or apologize for shortcomings I venture to avail
myself of the privilege to make a statement for the benefit of my
readers

As the first part of An OldFashioned Girl was written in 1869 the
demand for a sequel in beseeching little letters that made refusal
impossible rendered it necessary to carry my heroine boldly forward
some six or seven years into the future The domestic nature of the
story makes this audacious proceeding possible while the lively fancies
of my young readers will supply all deficiencies and overlook all
discrepancies

This explanation will I trust relieve those wellregulated minds
who cannot conceive of such literary lawlessness from the bewilderment
which they suffered when the same experiment was tried in a former book

The OldFashioned Girl is not intended as a perfect model but as
a possible improvement upon Page the Girl of the Period who seems
sorrowfully ignorant or ashamed of the good old fashions which make
woman truly beautiful and honored and through her render home what
it should bea happy place where parents and children brothers and
sisters learn to love and know and help one another

If the history of Pollys girlish experiences suggests a hint or
insinuates a lesson I shall feel that in spite of many obstacles I
have not entirely neglected my duty toward the little men and women for
whom it is an honor and a pleasure to write since in them I have always
found my kindest patrons gentlest critics warmest friends

CHAPTER I POLLY ARRIVES


ITS time to go to the station Tom

Come on then

Oh Im not going its too wet Should nt have a crimp left if I
went out such a day as this and I want to look nice when Polly comes

You dont expect me to go and bring home a strange girl alone do you
And Tom looked as much alarmed as if his sister had proposed to him to
escort the wild woman of Australia

Of course I do Its your place to go and get her and if you was nt
a bear youd like it

Well I call that mean I supposed Id got to go but you said youd
go too Catch me bothering about your friends another time No sir
And Tom rose from the sofa with an air of indignant resolution the
impressive effect of which was somewhat damaged by a tousled head and
the hunched appearance of his garments generally

Now dont be cross and Ill get mamma to let you have that horrid
Ned Miller that you are so fond of come and make you a visit after
Pollys gone said Fanny hoping to soothe his ruffled feelings

How long is she going to stay demanded Tom making his toilet by a
promiscuous shake

A month or two maybe Shes ever so nice and I shall keep her as
long as shes happy

She wont stay long then if I can help it muttered Tom who regarded
girls as a very unnecessary portion of creation Boys of fourteen are
apt to think so and perhaps it is a wise arrangement for being fond
of turning somersaults they have an opportunity of indulging in a good
one metaphorically speaking when three or four years later they
become the abject slaves of those bothering girls

Look here how am I going to know the creature I never saw her and
she never saw me Youll have to come too Fan he added pausing on
his way to the door arrested by the awful idea that he might have to
address several strange girls before he got the right one

Youll find her easy enough shell probably be standing round
looking for us I dare say shell know you though Im not there
because Ive described you to her

Guess she wont then and Tom gave a hasty smooth to his curly pate
and a glance at the mirror feeling sure that his sister had nt done
him justice Sisters never do as we fellows know too well

Do go along or youll be too late and then what will Polly think
of me cried Fanny with the impatient poke which is peculiarly
aggravating to masculine dignity

Shell think you cared more about your frizzles than your friends and
shell be about right too

Feeling that he said rather a neat and cutting thing Tom sauntered
leisurely away perfectly conscious that it was late but bent on not
being hurried while in sight though he ran himself off his legs to make
up for it afterward

If I was the President Id make a law to shut up all boys till they
were grown for they certainly are the most provoking toads in the
world said Fanny as she watched the slouchy figure of her brother
strolling down the street She might have changed her mind however
if she had followed him for as soon as he turned the corner his whole
aspect altered his hands came out of his pockets he stopped whistling
buttoned his jacket gave his cap a pull and went off at a great pace

The train was just in when he reached the station panting like a
racehorse and as red as a lobster with the wind and the run

Suppose shell wear a topknot and a thingumbob like every one else
and however shall I know her Too bad of Fan to make me come alone
thought Tom as he stood watching the crowd stream through the depot
and feeling rather daunted at the array of young ladies who passed As
none of them seemed looking for any one he did not accost them but
eyed each new batch with the air of a martyr Thats her he said
to himself as he presently caught sight of a girl in gorgeous array
standing with her hands folded and a very small hat perched on the top
of a very large chignon as Tom pronounced it I suppose Ive got
to speak to her so here goes and nerving himself to the task Tom
slowly approached the damsel who looked as if the wind had blown her
clothes into rags such a flapping of sashes scallops ruffles curls
and feathers was there

I say if you please is your name Polly Milton meekly asked Tom
pausing before the breezy stranger

No it is nt answered the young lady with a cool stare that utterly
quenched him

Where in thunder is she growled Tom walking off in high dudgeon The
quick tap of feet behind him made him turn in time to see a freshfaced
little girl running down the long station and looking as if she rather
liked it As she smiled and waved her bag at him he stopped and waited
for her saying to himself Hullo I wonder if thats Polly

Up came the little girl with her hand out and a halfshy halfmerry
look in her blue eyes as she said inquiringly This is Tom is nt
it

Yes How did you know and Tom got over the ordeal of handshaking
without thinking of it he was so surprised

Oh Fan told me youd got curly hair and a funny nose and kept
whistling and wore a gray cap pulled over your eyes so I knew you
directly And Polly nodded at him in the most friendly manner having
politely refrained from calling the hair red the nose a pug and
the cap old all of which facts Fanny had carefully impressed upon her
memory

Where are your trunks asked Tom as he was reminded of his duty by
her handing him the bag which he had not offered to take

Father told me not to wait for any one else Id lose my chance of a
hack so I gave my check to a man and there he is with my trunk and
Polly walked off after her one modest piece of baggage followed by Tom
who felt a trifle depressed by his own remissness in polite attentions
She is nt a bit of a young lady thank goodness Fan did nt tell me
she was pretty Dont look like city girls nor act likeem neither
he thought trudging in the rear and eyeing with favor the brown curls
bobbing along in front

As the carriage drove off Polly gave a little bounce on the springy
seat and laughed like a delighted child I do like to ride in these
nice hacks and see all the fine things and have a good time dont
you she said composing herself the next minute as if it suddenly
occurred to her that she was going avisiting

Not much said Tom not minding what he said for the fact that he was
shut up with the strange girl suddenly oppressed his soul

Hows Fan Why did nt she come too asked Polly trying to look
demure while her eyes danced in spite of her

Afraid of spoiling her crinkles and Tom smiled for this base
betrayal of confidence made him feel his own man again

You and I dont mind dampness Im much obliged to you for coming to
take care of me

It was kind of Polly to say that and Tom felt it for his red crop was
a tender point and to be associated with Pollys pretty brown curls
seemed to lessen its coppery glow Then he had nt done anything for her
but carry the bag a few steps yet she thanked him He felt grateful
and in a burst of confidence offered a handful of peanuts for his
pockets were always supplied with this agreeable delicacy and he might
be traced anywhere by the trail of shells he left behind him

As soon as he had done it he remembered that Fanny considered them
vulgar and felt that he had disgraced his family So he stuck his
head out of the window and kept it there so long that Polly asked if
anything was the matter Pooh who cares for a countrified little thing
like her said Tom manfully to himself and then the spirit of mischief
entered in and took possession of him

Hes pretty drunk but I guess he can hold his horses replied this
evilminded boy with an air of calm resignation

Is the man tipsy Oh dear lets get out Are the horses bad Its
very steep here do you think its safe cried poor Polly making a
cocked hat of her little beaver by thrusting it out of the halfopen
window on her side

Theres plenty of folks to pick us up if anything happens but perhaps
it would be safer if I got out and sat with the man and Tom quite
beamed with the brilliancy of this sudden mode of relief

Oh do if you aint afraid Mother would be so anxious if anything
should happen to me so far away cried Polly much distressed

Dont you be worried Ill manage the old chap and the horses too
and opening the door Tom vanished aloft leaving poor victimized Polly
to quake inside while he placidly revelled in freedom and peanuts
outside with the staid old driver

Fanny came flying down to meet her darling Polly as Tom presented
her with the graceful remark Ive got her and the air of a
dauntless hunter producing the trophies of his skill Polly was
instantly whisked up stairs and having danced a doubleshuffle on the
doormat Tom retired to the diningroom to restore exhausted nature
with half a dozen cookies

Aint you tired to death Dont you want to lie down said Fanny
sitting on the side of the bed in Pollys room and chattering hard
while she examined everything her friend had on

Not a bit I had a nice time coming and no trouble except the tipsy
coachman but Tom got out and kept him in order so I was nt much
frightened answered innocent Polly taking off her roughandready
coat and the plain hat without a bit of a feather

Fiddlestick he was nt tipsy and Tom only did it to get out of the
way He cant bear girls said Fanny with a superior air

Cant he Why I thought he was very pleasant and kind and Polly
opened her eyes with a surprised expression

Hes an awful boy my dear and if you have anything to do with
him hell torment you to death Boys are all horrid but hes the
horridest one I ever saw

Fanny went to a fashionable school where the young ladies were so busy
with their French German and Italian that there was no time for
good English Feeling her confidence much shaken in the youth Polly
privately resolved to let him alone and changed the conversation by
saying as she looked admiringly about the large handsome room How
splendid it is I never slept in a bed with curtains before or had such
a fine toilettable as this

Im glad you like it but dont for mercy sake say such things
before the other girls replied Fanny wishing Polly would wear
earrings as every one else did

Why not asked the country mouse of the city mouse wondering what
harm there was in liking other peoples pretty things and saying
so Oh they laugh at everything the least bit odd and that is nt
pleasant Fanny did nt say countrified but she meant it and Polly
felt uncomfortable So she shook out her little black silk apron with
a thoughtful face and resolved not to allude to her own home if she
could help it

Im so poorly mamma says I need nt go to school regularly while you
are here only two or three times a week just to keep up my music and
French You can go too if you like papa said so Do its such fun
cried Fanny quite surprising her friend by this unexpected fondness for
school

I should be afraid if all the girls dress as finely as you do and
know as much said Polly beginning to feel shy at the thought

La child you need nt mind that Ill take care of you and fix you
up so you wont look odd

Am I odd asked Polly struck by the word and hoping it did nt mean
anything very bad

You are a dear and ever so much prettier than you were last summer
only youve been brought up differently from us so your ways aint
like ours you see began Fanny finding it rather hard to explain

How different asked Polly again for she liked to understand things

Well you dress like a little girl for one thing

I am a little girl so why should nt I and Polly looked at her
simple blue merino frock stout boots and short hair with a puzzled
air

You are fourteen and we consider ourselves young ladies at that age
continued Fanny surveying with complacency the pile of hair on the
top of her head with a fringe of fuzz round her forehead and a wavy
lock streaming down her back likewise her scarletandblack suit with
its big sash little pannier bright buttons points rosettes and
heaven knows what There was a locket on her neck earrings tinkling
in her ears watch and chain at her belt and several rings on a pair of
hands that would have been improved by soap and water

Pollys eye went from one little figure to the other and she thought
that Fanny looked the oddest of the two for Polly lived in a quiet
country town and knew very little of city fashions She was rather
impressed by the elegance about her never having seen Fannys home
before as they got acquainted while Fanny paid a visit to a friend who
lived near Polly But she did nt let the contrast between herself and
Fan trouble her for in a minute she laughed and said contentedly My
mother likes me to dress simply and I dont mind I should nt know
what to do rigged up as you are Dont you ever forget to lift your sash
and fix those puffy things when you sit down

Before Fanny could answer a scream from below made both listen It
s only Maud she fusses all day long began Fanny and the words were
hardly out of her mouth when the door was thrown open and a little
girl of six or seven came roaring in She stopped at sight of Polly
stared a minute then took up her roar just where she left it and cast
herself into Fannys lap exclaiming wrathfully Toms laughing at me
Make him stop

What did you do to set him going Dont scream so youll frighten
Polly and Fan gave the cherub a shake which produced an explanation

I only said we had cold cweam at the party last night and he
laughed

Icecream child and Fanny followed Toms reprehensible example

I dont care it was cold and I warmed mine at the wegister and then
it was nice only Willy Bliss spilt it on my new Gabwielle and Maud
wailed again over her accumulated woes

Do go to Katy Youre as cross as a little bear today said Fanny
pushing her away

Katy dont amoose me and I must be amoosedcause Im fwactious
mamma said I was sobbed Maud evidently laboring under the delusion
that fractiousness was some interesting malady

Come down and have dinner that will amuse you and Fanny got up
pluming herself as a bird does before its flight

Polly hoped the dreadful boy would not be present but he was and
stared at her all dinnertime in a most trying manner Mr Shaw a
busylooking gentleman said How do you do my dear Hope youll
enjoy yourself and then appeared to forget her entirely Mrs Shaw a
pale nervous woman greeted her little guest kindly and took care that
she wanted for nothing Madam Shaw a quiet old lady with an imposing
cap exclaimed on seeing Polly Bless my heart the image of her mother
a sweet woman how is she dear and kept peering at the newcomer over
her glasses till between Madam and Tom poor Polly lost her appetite

Fanny chatted like a magpie and Maud fidgeted till Tom proposed to put
her under the big dishcover which produced such an explosion that the
young lady was borne screaming away by the muchenduring Katy It was
altogether an uncomfortable dinner and Polly was very glad when it was
over They all went about their own affairs and after doing the honors
of the house Fan was called to the dressmaker leaving Polly to amuse
herself in the great drawingroom

Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes and having examined all
the pretty things about her began to walk up and down over the soft
flowery carpet humming to herself as the daylight faded and only the
ruddy glow of the fire filled the room Presently Madam came slowly in
and sat down in her armchair saying Thats a fine old tune sing it
to me my dear I have nt heard it this many a day Polly did nt like
to sing before strangers for she had had no teaching but such as her
busy mother could give her but she had been taught the utmost respect
for old people and having no reason for refusing she directly went to
the piano and did as she was bid

Thats the sort of music its a pleasure to hear Sing some more
dear said Madam in her gentle way when she had done

Pleased with this praise Polly sang away in a fresh little voice that
went straight to the listeners heart and nestled there The sweet
old tunes that one is never tired of were all Pollys store and her
favorites were Scotch airs such as YellowHaired Laddie Jock o
Hazeldean Down among the Heather and Birks of Aberfeldie The
more she sung the better she did it and when she wound up with A
Health to King Charlie the room quite rung with the stirring music
made by the big piano and the little maid

By George thats a jolly tune Sing it again please cried Toms
voice and there was Toms red head bobbing up over the high back of the
chair where he had hidden himself

It gave Polly quite a turn for she thought no one was hearing her but
the old lady dozing by the fire I cant sing any more Im tired
she said and walked away to Madam in the other room The red head
vanished like a meteor for Pollys tone had been decidedly cool

The old lady put out her hand and drawing Polly to her knee looked
into her face with such kind eyes that Polly forgot the impressive cap
and smiled at her confidingly for she saw that her simple music had
pleased her listener and she felt glad to know it

You must nt mind my staring dear said Madam softly pinching her
rosy cheek I have nt seen a little girl for so long it does my old
eyes good to look at you

Polly thought that a very odd speech and could nt help saying Are
nt Fan and Maud little girls too

Oh dear no not what I call little girls Fan has been a young
lady this two years and Maud is a spoiled baby Your mothers a very
sensible woman my child

What a very queer old lady thought Polly but she said Yesm
respectfully and looked at the fire

You dont understand what I mean do you asked Madam still holding
her by the chin

Nom not quite

Well dear Ill tell you In my day children of fourteen and fifteen
did nt dress in the height of the fashion go to parties as nearly
like those of grown people as its possible to make them lead idle
giddy unhealthy lives and get blase at twenty We were little folks
till eighteen or so worked and studied dressed and played like
children honored our parents and our days were much longer in the land
than now it seems to me

The old lady appeared to forget Polly at the end of her speech for she
sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own and looking up at
a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue

Was he your father Madam

Yes dear my honored father I did up his frills to the day of his
death and the first money I ever earned was five dollars which
he offered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the
handsomest darn in his silk stockings

How proud you must have been cried Polly leaning on the old ladys
knee with an interested face

Yes and we all learned to make bread and cook and wore little
chintz gowns and were as gay and hearty as kittens All lived to be
grandmothers and fathers and Im the last seventy next birthday
my dear and not worn out yet though daughter Shaw is an invalid at
forty

Thats the way I was brought up and thats why Fan calls me
oldfashioned I suppose Tell more about your papa please I like it
said Polly

Sayfather We never called him papa and if one of my brothers had
addressed him asgovernor as boys do now I really think hed have
him cut off with a shilling

Madam raised her voice in saying this and nodded significantly but a
mild snore from the other room seemed to assure her that it was a waste
of shot to fire in that direction

Before she could continue in came Fanny with the joyful news that
Clara Bird had invited them both to go to the theatre with her that very
evening and would call for them at seven oclock Polly was so excited
by this sudden plunge into the dissipations of city life that she flew
about like a distracted butterfly and hardly knew what happened till
she found herself seated before the great green curtain in the brilliant
theatre Old Mr Bird sat on one side Fanny on the other and both let
her alone for which she was very grateful as her whole attention was
so absorbed in the scene around her that she could nt talk

Polly had never been much to the theatre and the few plays she had
seen were the good old fairy tales dramatized to suit young beholders
lively bright and full of the harmless nonsense which brings the laugh
without the blush That night she saw one of the new spectacles which
have lately become the rage and run for hundreds of nights dazzling
exciting and demoralizing the spectator by every allurement French
ingenuity can invent and American prodigality execute Never mind what
its name was it was very gorgeous very vulgar and very fashionable
so of course it was much admired and every one went to see it At
first Polly thought she had got into fairyland and saw only the
sparkling creatures who danced and sung in a world of light and beauty
but presently she began to listen to the songs and conversation and
then the illusion vanished for the lovely phantoms sang negro melodies
talked slang and were a disgrace to the good oldfashioned elves whom
she knew and loved so well

Our little girl was too innocent to understand half the jokes and often
wondered what people were laughing at but as the first enchantment
subsided Polly began to feel uncomfortable to be sure her mother
would nt like to have her there and to wish she had nt come Somehow
things seemed to get worse and worse as the play went on for our small
spectator was being rapidly enlightened by the gossip going on all
about her as well as by her own quick eyes and girlish instincts
When fourandtwenty girls dressed as jockeys came prancing on to the
stage cracking their whips stamping the heels of their topboots and
winking at the audience Polly did not think it at all funny but
looked disgusted and was glad when they were gone but when another
set appeared in a costume consisting of gauze wings and a bit of gold
fringe round the waist poor unfashionable Polly did nt know what to
do for she felt both frightened and indignant and sat with her eyes on
her playbill and her cheeks getting hotter and hotter every minute

What are you blushing so for asked Fanny as the painted sylphs
vanished

Im so ashamed of those girls whispered Polly taking a long breath
of relief

You little goose its just the way it was done in Paris and the
dancing is splendid It seems queer at first but youll get used to
it as I did

Ill never come again said Polly decidedly for her innocent nature
rebelled against the spectacle which as yet gave her more pain than
pleasure She did not know how easy it was to get used to it as Fanny
did and it was well for her that the temptation was not often offered
She could not explain the feeling but she was glad when the play was
done and they were safe at home where kind grandma was waiting to see
them comfortably into bed

Did you have a good time dear she asked looking at Pollys feverish
cheeks and excited eyes

I dont wish to be rude but I did nt answered Polly Some of it
was splendid but a good deal of it made me want to go under the seat
People seemed to like it but I dont think it was proper

As Polly freed her mind and emphasized her opinion with a decided rap
of the boot she had just taken off Fanny laughed and said while
she pirouetted about the room like Mademoiselle Therese Polly was
shocked grandma Her eyes were as big as saucers her face as red as
my sash and once I thought she was going to cry Some of it was rather
queer but of course it was proper or all our set would nt go I
heard Mrs Smythe Perkins say It was charming so like dear Paris
and she has lived abroad so of course she knows what is what

I dont care if she has I know it was nt proper for little girls
to see or I should nt have been so ashamed cried sturdy Polly
perplexed but not convinced even by Mrs Smythe Perkins

I think you are right my dear but you have lived in the country and
have nt yet learned that modesty has gone out of fashion And with a
goodnight kiss grandma left Polly to dream dreadfully of dancing in
jockey costume on a great stage while Tom played a big drum in the
orchestra and the audience all wore the faces of her father and mother
looking sorrowfully at her with eyes like saucers and faces as red as
Fannys sash




CHAPTER II NEW FASHIONS


IM going to school this morning so come up and get ready said
Fanny a day or two after as she left the late breakfasttable

You look very nice what have you got to do asked Polly following
her into the hall

Prink half an hour and put on her wad answered the irreverent Tom
whose preparations for school consisted in flinging his cap on to his
head and strapping up several big books that looked as if they were
sometimes used as weapons of defence

What is a wad asked Polly while Fanny marched up without deigning
any reply

Somebodys hair on the top of her head in the place where it ought not
to be and Tom went whistling away with an air of sublime indifference
as to the state of his own curly pow

Why must you be so fine to go to school asked Polly watching Fan
arrange the little frizzles on her forehead and settle the various
streamers and festoons belonging to her dress

All the girls do and its proper for you never know who you may
meet Im going to walk after my lessons so I wish youd wear your
best hat and sack answered Fanny trying to stick her own hat on at an
angle which defied all the laws of gravitation

I will if you dont think this is nice enough I like the other best
because it has a feather but this is warmer so I wear it every day
And Polly ran into her own room to prink also fearing that her friend
might be ashamed of her plain costume Wont your hands be cold in kid
gloves she said as they went down the snowy street with a north wind
blowing in their faces

Yes horrid cold but my muff is so big I wont carry it Mamma wont
have it cut up and my ermine one must be kept for best and Fanny
smoothed her Bismark kids with an injured air

I suppose my gray squirrel is ever so much too big but its nice and
cosy and you may warm your hands in it if you want to said Polly
surveying her new woollen gloves with a dissatisfied look though she
had thought them quite elegant before

Perhaps I will by and by Now Polly dont you be shy Ill only
introduce two or three of the girls and you need nt mind old Monsieur
a bit or read if you dont want to We shall be in the anteroom so you
ll only see about a dozen and they will be so busy they wont mind
you much

I guess I wont read but sit and look on I like to watch people
everything is so new and queer here

But Polly did feel and look very shy when she was ushered into a room
full of young ladies as they seemed to her all very much dressed all
talking together and all turning to examine the newcomer with a cool
stare which seemed to be as much the fashion as eyeglasses They nodded
affably when Fanny introduced her said something civil and made room
for her at the table round which they sat waiting for Monsieur Several
of the more frolicsome were imitating the Grecian Bend some were
putting their heads together over little notes nearly all were eating
confectionery and the entire twelve chattered like magpies Being
politely supplied with caramels Polly sat looking and listening
feeling very young and countrified among these elegant young ladies

Girls do you know that Carrie has gone abroad There has been so much
talk her father could nt bear it and took the whole family off Is
nt that gay said one lively damsel who had just come in

I should think theyd better go My mamma says if Id been going to
that school shed have taken me straight away answered another girl
with an important air

Carrie ran away with an Italian musicteacher and it got into the
papers and made a great stir explained the first speaker to Polly
who looked mystified

How dreadful cried Polly

I think it was fun She was only sixteen and he was perfectly
splendid and she has plenty of money and every one talked about it
and when she went anywhere people looked you know and she liked it
but her papa is an old poke so hes sent them all away Its too bad
for she was the jolliest thing I ever knew

Polly had nothing to say to lively Miss Belle but Fanny observed I
like to read about such things but its so inconvenient to have it
happen right here because it makes it harder for us I wish you could
have heard my papa go on He threatened to send a maid to school with me
every day as they do in New York to be sure I come all right Did you
ever Thats because it came out that Carrie used to forge excuses in
her mammas name and go promenading with her Oreste when they thought
her safe at school Oh was nt she a sly minx cried Belle as if she
rather admired the trick

I think a little fun is all right and theres no need of making a
talk if now and then some one does run off like Carrie Boys do
as they like and I dont see why girls need to be kept so dreadfully
close Id like to see anybody watching and guarding me added another
dashing young lady

It would take a policeman to do that Trix or a little man in a tall
hat said Fanny slyly which caused a general laugh and made Beatrice
toss her head coquettishly

Oh have you read The Phantom Bride Its perfectly thrilling There
s a regular rush for it at the library but some prefer Breaking a
Butterfly Which do you like best asked a pale girl of Polly in one
of the momentary lulls which occurred

I have nt read either

You must then I adore Guy Livingstons books and Yatess Ouidas
are my delight only they are so long I get worn out before Im
through

I have nt read anything but one of the Muhlbach novels since I came I
like those because there is history in them said Polly glad to have
a word to say for herself

Those are well enough for improving reading but I like real exciting
novels dont you

Polly was spared the mortification of owning that she had never read
any by the appearance of Monsieur a grayheaded old Frenchman who
went through his task with the resigned air of one who was used to being
the victim of giggling schoolgirls The young ladies gabbled over the
lesson wrote an exercise and read a little French history But it did
not seem to make much impression upon them though Monsieur was very
ready to explain and Polly quite blushed for her friend when on
being asked what famous Frenchman fought in our Revolution she answered
Lamartine instead of Lafayette

The hour was soon over and when Fan had taken a music lesson in another
room while Polly looked on it was time for recess The younger girls
walked up and down the court arm in arm eating bread an butter others
stayed in the schoolroom to read and gossip but Belle Trix and
Fanny went to lunch at a fashionable icecream saloon near by and Polly
meekly followed not daring to hint at the gingerbread grandma had put
in her pocket for luncheon So the honest brown cookies crumbled away
in obscurity while Polly tried to satisfy her hearty appetite on one
ice and three macaroons

The girls seemed in great spirits particularly after they were joined
by a short gentleman with such a young face that Polly would have called
him a boy if he had not worn a tall beaver Escorted by this impressive
youth Fanny left her unfortunate friends to return to school and went
to walk as she called a slow promenade down the most crowded
streets Polly discreetly fell behind and amused herself looking
into shopwindows till Fanny mindful of her manners even at such an
interesting time took her into a picture gallery and bade her enjoy
the works of art while they rested Obedient Polly went through the room
several times apparently examining the pictures with the interest of a
connoisseur and trying not to hear the mild prattle of the pair on the
round seat But she could nt help wondering what Fan found so absorbing
in an account of a recent German and why she need promise so solemnly
not to forget the concert that afternoon

When Fanny rose at last Pollys tired face reproached her and taking
a hasty leave of the small gentleman she turned homeward saying
confidentially as she put one hand in Pollys muff Now my dear you
must nt say a word about Frank Moore or papa will take my head off I
dont care a bit for him and he likes Trix only they have quarrelled
and he wants to make her mad by flirting a little with me I scolded him
well and he promised to make up with her We all go to the afternoon
concerts and have a gay time and Belle and Trix are to be there
today so just keep quiet and everything will be all right

Im afraid it wont began Polly who not being used to secrets
found it very hard to keep even a small one

Dont worry child Its none of our business so we can go and enjoy
the music and if other people flirt it wont be our fault said
Fanny impatiently

Of course not but then if your father dont like you to do so ought
you to go

I tell mamma and she dont care Papa is fussy and grandma makes a
stir about every blessed thing I do You will hold your tongue wont
you

Yes I truly will I never tell tales And Polly kept her word
feeling sure Fan did nt mean to deceive her father since she told her
mother everything

Who are you going with asked Mrs Shaw when Fanny mentioned that it
was concertday just before three oclock

Only Polly she likes music and it was so stormy I could nt go last
week you know answered Fan adding as they left the house again If
any one meets us on the way I cant help it can I

You can tell them not to cant you

Thats rude Dear me heres Belles brother Gus he always goes Is
my hair all right and my hat

Before Polly could answer Mr Gus joined them as a matter of course
and Polly soon found herself trotting on behind feeling that things
were not all right though she did nt know how to mend them Being
fond of music she ignorantly supposed that every one else went for that
alone and was much disturbed by the whispering that went on among the
young people round her Belle and Trix were there in full dress and in
the pauses between different pieces Messrs Frank and Gus with several
other splendid fellows regaled the young ladies with college gossip
and bits of news full of interest to judge from the close attention
paid to their eloquent remarks Polly regarded these noble beings with
awe and they recognized her existence with the condescension of their
sex but they evidently considered her only a quiet little thing and
finding her not up to society talk blandly ignored the pretty child
and devoted themselves to the young ladies Fortunately for Polly she
forgot all about them in her enjoyment of the fine music which she felt
rather than understood and sat listening with such a happy face that
several true musiclovers watched her smilingly for her heart gave a
blithe welcome to the melody which put the little instrument in tune
It was dusk when they went out and Polly was much relieved to find the
carriage waiting for them because playing third fiddle was not to her
taste and she had had enough of it for one day

Im glad those men are gone they did worry me so talking when I
wanted to hear said Polly as they rolled away

Which did you like best asked Fanny with a languid air of
superiority

The plain one who did nt say much he picked up my muff when it
tumbled down and took care of me in the crowd the others did nt mind
anything about me

They thought you were a little girl I suppose

My mother says a real gentleman is as polite to a little girl as to a
woman so I like Mr Sydney best because he was kind to me

What a sharp child you are Polly I should nt have thought youd
mind things like that said Fanny beginning to understand that there
may be a good deal of womanliness even in a little girl

Im used to good manners though I do live in the country replied
Polly rather warmly for she did nt like to be patronized even by her
friends

Grandma says your mother is a perfect lady and you are just like her
so dont get in a passion with those poor fellows and Ill see that
they behave better next time Tom has no manners at all and you dont
complain of him added Fan with a laugh

I dont care if he has nt hes a boy and acts like one and I can
get on with him a great deal better than I can with those men

Fanny was just going to take Polly to task for saying those men
in such a disrespectful tone when both were startled by a smothered
Cockadoodledoo from under the opposite seat

Its Tom cried Fanny and with the words out tumbled that
incorrigible boy red in the face and breathless with suppressed
laughter Seating himself he surveyed the girls as if well satisfied
with the success of his prank and waiting to be congratulated upon it
Did you hear what we were saying demanded Fanny uneasily

Oh did nt I every word And Tom exulted over them visibly

Did you ever see such a provoking toad Polly Now I suppose youll
go and tell papa a great story

Praps I shall and praps I shant How Polly did hop when I crowed
I heard her squeal and saw her cuddle up her feet

And you heard us praise your manners did nt you asked Polly slyly

Yes and you likedem so I wont tell on you said Tom with a
reassuring nod

Theres nothing to tell

Aint there though What do you suppose the governor will say to you
girls going on so with those dandies I saw you

What has the Governor of Massachusetts to do with us asked Polly
trying to look as if she meant what she said

Pooh you know who I mean so you need nt try to catch me up as
grandma does

Tom Ill make a bargain with you cried Fanny eagerly It was
nt my fault that Gus and Frank were there and I could nt help their
speaking to me I do as well as I can and papa need nt be angry for I
behave ever so much better than some of the girls Dont I Polly

Bargain observed Tom with an eye to business

If you wont go and make a fuss telling what youd no right to hear
it was so mean to hide and listen I should think youd be ashamed
of it Ill help you tease for your velocipede and wont say a word
against it when mamma and granny beg papa not to let you have it

Will you and Tom paused to consider the offer in all its bearings

Yes and Polly will help wont you

Id rather not have anything to do with it but Ill be quiet and
not do any harm

Why wont you asked Tom curiously

Because it seems like deceiving

Well papa need nt be so fussy said Fan petulantly

After hearing about that Carrie and the rest I dont wonder he is
fussy Why dont you tell right out and not do it any more if he dont
want you to said Polly persuasively

Do you go and tell your father and mother everything right out

Yes I do and it saves ever so much trouble

Aint you afraid of them

Of course Im not Its hard to tell sometimes but its so
comfortable when its over

Lets was Toms brief advice

Mercy me what a fuss about nothing said Fanny ready to cry with
vexation

T is nt nothing You know you are forbidden to go gallivanting round
with those chaps and thats the reason youre in a pucker now I
wont make any bargain and I will tell returned Tom seized with a
sudden fit of moral firmness

Will you if I promise never never to do so any more asked Fanny
meekly for when Thomas took matters into his own hands his sister
usually submitted in spite of herself

Ill think about it and if you behave maybe I wont do it at all I
can watch you better than papa can so if you try it again its
all up with you miss said Tom finding it impossible to resist the
pleasure of tyrannizing a little when he got the chance

She wont dont plague her any more and she will be good to you when
you get into scrapes answered Polly with her arm round Fan

I never do and if I did I should nt ask a girl to help me out

Why not Id ask you in a minute if I was in trouble said Polly in
her confiding way

Would you Well Id put you through as sure as my names Tom Shaw
Now then dont slip Polly and Mr Thomas helped them out with
unusual politeness for that friendly little speech gratified him He
felt that one person appreciated him and it had a good effect upon
manners and temper made rough and belligerent by constant snubbing and
opposition

After tea that evening Fanny proposed that Polly should show her how
to make molasses candy as it was cooks holiday and the coast would
be clear Hoping to propitiate her tormentor Fan invited Tom to join in
the revel and Polly begged that Maud might sit up and see the fun
so all four descended to the big kitchen armed with aprons hammers
spoons and pans and Polly assumed command of the forces Tom was set
to cracking nuts and Maud to picking out the meats for the candy was
to be tiptop Fan waited on Polly cook who hovered over the kettle
of boiling molasses till her face was the color of a peony Now put
in the nuts she said at last and Tom emptied his plate into the
foamy syrup while the others watched with deep interest the mysterious
concoction of this wellbeloved sweetmeat I pour it into the buttered
pan you see and it cools and then we can eat it explained Polly
suiting the action to the word

Why its all full of shells exclaimed Maud peering into the pan

Oh thunder I must have putem in by mistake and ate up the meats
without thinking said Tom trying to conceal his naughty satisfaction
as the girls hung over the pan with faces full of disappointment and
despair

You did it on purpose you horrid boy Ill never let you have
anything to do with my fun again cried Fan in a passion trying to
catch and shake him while he dodged and chuckled in high glee

Maud began to wail over her lost delight and Polly gravely poked at the
mess which was quite spoilt But her attention was speedily diverted
by the squabble going on in the corner for Fanny forgetful of her
youngladyism and her sixteen years had boxed Toms ears and Tom
resenting the insult had forcibly seated her in the coalhod where he
held her with one hand while he returned the compliment with the
other Both were very angry and kept twitting one another with every
aggravation they could invent as they scolded and scuffled presenting
a most unlovely spectacle

Polly was not a model girl by any means and had her little pets and
tempers like the rest of us but she did nt fight scream and squabble
with her brothers and sisters in this disgraceful way and was much
surprised to see her elegant friend in such a passion Oh dont
Please dont Youll hurt her Tom Let him go Fanny Its no matter
about the candy we can make some more cried Polly trying to part
them and looking so distressed that they stopped ashamed and in a
minute sorry that she should see such a display of temper

I aint going to be hustled round so youd better let me alone Fan
said Tom drawing off with a threatening wag of the head adding in
a different tone I only put the shells in for fun Polly You cook
another kettleful and Ill pick you some meats all fair Will you

Its pretty hot work and its a pity to waste things but Ill try
again if you want me to said Polly with a patient sigh for her arms
were tired and her face uncomfortably hot

We dont want you get away said Maud shaking a sticky spoon at him

Keep quiet crybaby Im going to stay and help may nt I Polly

Bears like sweet things so you want some candy I guess Where is
the molasses Weve used up all there was in the jug said Polly
goodnaturedly beginning again

Down cellar Ill get it and taking the lamp and jug Tom departed
bent on doing his duty now like a saint

The moment his light vanished Fanny bolted the door saying
spitefully Now we are safe from any more tricks Let him thump and
call it only serves him right and when the candy is done well let
the rascal out

How can we make it without molasses asked Polly thinking that would
settle the matter

Theres plenty in the storeroom No you shant let him up till Im
ready Hes got to learn that Im not to be shaken by a little chit
like him Make your candy and let him alone or Ill go and tell papa
and then Tom will get a lecture

Polly thought it was nt fair but Maud clamored for her candy and
finding she could do nothing to appease Fan Polly devoted her mind to
her cookery till the nuts were safely in and a nice panful set in the
yard to cool A few bangs at the locked door a few threats of vengeance
from the prisoner such as setting the house on fire drinking up the
wine and mashing the jellypots and then all was so quiet that the
girls forgot him in the exciting crisis of their work

He cant possibly get out anywhere and as soon weve cut up the
candy well unbolt the door and run Come and get a nice dish to put
it in said Fan when Polly proposed to go halves with Tom lest he
should come bursting in somehow and seize the whole

When they came down with the dish in which to set forth their treat
and opened the backdoor to find it imagine their dismay on discovering
that it was gone pan candy and all utterly and mysteriously gone

A general lament arose when a careful rummage left no hopes for
the fates had evidently decreed at candy was not to prosper on this
unpropitious night

The hot pan has melted and sunk in the snow perhaps said Fanny
digging into the drift where it was left

Those old cats have got it I guess suggested Maud too much
overwhelmed by this second blow to howl as usual

The gate is nt locked and some beggar has stolen it I hope it will
do him good added Polly turning from her exploring expedition

If Tom could get out I should think hed carried it off but not
being a rat he cant go through the bits of windows so it was nt
him said Fanny disconsolately for she began to think this double
loss a punishment for letting angry passions rise Lets open the door
and tell him about it proposed Polly

Hell crow over us No well open it and go to bed and he can come
out when he likes Provoking boy if he had nt plagued us so we should
have had a nice time

Unbolting the cellar door the girls announced to the invisible captive
that they were through and then departed much depressed Halfway up
the second flight they all stopped as suddenly as if they had seen
a ghost for looking over the banisters was Toms face crocky but
triumphant and in either hand a junk of candy which he waved above
them as he vanished with the tantalizing remark Dont you wish you
had some

How in the world did he get out cried Fanny steadying herself after
a start that nearly sent all three tumbling down stairs

Coalhole answered a spectral voice from the gloom above

Good gracious He must have poked up the cover climbed into the
street stole the candy and sneaked in at the shedwindow while we were
looking for it

Cats got it did nt they jeered the voice in a tone that made Polly
sit down and laugh till she could nt laugh any longer

Just give Maud a bit shes so disappointed Fan and I are sick of it
and so will you be if you eat it all called Polly when she got her
breath

Go to bed Maudie and look under your pillow when you get there was
the oracular reply that came down to them as Toms door closed after a
jubilant solo on the tin pan

The girls went to bed tired out and Maud slumbered placidly hugging
the sticky bundle found where molasses candy is not often discovered
Polly was very tired and soon fell asleep but Fanny who slept with
her lay awake longer than usual thinking about her troubles for her
head ached and the dissatisfaction that follows anger would not let her
rest with the tranquillity that made the rosy face in the little round
nightcap such a pleasant sight to see as it lay beside her The gas was
turned down but Fanny saw a figure in a gray wrapper creep by her door
and presently return pausing to look in Who is it she cried so
loud that Polly woke

Only me dear answered grandmas mild voice Poor Tom has got a
dreadful toothache and I came down to find some creosote for him He
told me not to tell you but I cant find the bottle and dont want to
disturb mamma

Its in my closet Old Tom will pay for his trick this time said
Fanny in a satisfied tone

I thought hed get enough of our candy laughed Polly and then they
fell asleep leaving Tom to the delights of toothache and the tender
mercies of kind old grandma




CHAPTER III POLLYS TROUBLES


POLLY soon found that she was in a new world a world where the manners
and customs were so different from the simple ways at home that she
felt like a stranger in a strange land and often wished that she had
not come In the first place she had nothing to do but lounge and
gossip read novels parade the streets and dress and before a week
was gone she was as heartily sick of all this as a healthy person
would be who attempted to live on confectionery Fanny liked it because
she was used to it and had never known anything better but Polly
had and often felt like a little woodbird shut up in a gilded cage
Nevertheless she was much impressed by the luxuries all about her
enjoyed them wished she owned them and wondered why the Shaws were not
a happier family She was not wise enough to know where the trouble lay
she did not attempt to say which of the two lives was the right one she
only knew which she liked best and supposed it was merely another of
her oldfashioned ways

Fannys friends did not interest her much she was rather afraid of
them they seemed so much older and wiser than herself even those
younger in years They talked about things of which she knew nothing and
when Fanny tried to explain she did nt find them interesting indeed
some of them rather shocked and puzzled her so the girls let her alone
being civil when they met but evidently feeling that she was too odd
to belong to their set Then she turned to Maud for companionship for
her own little sister was excellent company and Polly loved her dearly
But Miss Maud was much absorbed in her own affairs for she belonged
to a set also and these mites of five and six had their musicals
their parties receptions and promenades as well as their elders and
the chief idea of their little lives seemed to be to ape the fashionable
follies they should have been too innocent to understand Maud had her
tiny cardcase and paid calls like mamma and Fan her box of dainty
gloves her jeweldrawer her crimpingpins as fine and fanciful a
wardrobe as a Paris doll and a French maid to dress her Polly could
nt get on with her at first for Maud did nt seem like a child and
often corrected Polly in her conversation and manners though little
mademoiselles own were anything but perfect Now and then when Maud
felt poorly or had a fwactious turn for she had nerves as well as
mamma she would go to Polly to be amoosed for her gentle ways and
kind forbearance soothed the little fine lady better than anything else
Polly enjoyed these times and told stories played games or went
out walking just as Maud liked slowly and surely winning the childs
heart and relieving the whole house of the young tyrant who ruled it

Tom soon got over staring at Polly and at first did not take much
notice of her for in his opinion girls did nt amount to much
anyway and considering the style of girl he knew most about Polly
quite agreed with him He occasionally refreshed himself by teasing her
to see how shed stand it and caused Polly much anguish of spirit for
she never knew where he would take her next He bounced out at her from
behind doors booed at her in dark entries clutched her feet as she
went up stairs startled her by shrill whistles right in her ear or
sudden tweaks of the hair as he passed her in the street and as sure as
there was company to dinner he fixed his round eyes on her and never
took them off till she was reduced to a piteous state of confusion and
distress She used to beg him not to plague her but he said he did
it for her good she was too shy and needed toughening like the other
girls In vain she protested that she did nt want to be like the other
girls in that respect he only laughed in her face stuck his red hair
straight up all over his head and glared at her till she fled in
dismay

Yet Polly rather liked Tom for she soon saw that he was neglected
hustled out of the way and left to get on pretty much by himself She
often wondered why his mother did nt pet him as she did the girls
why his father ordered him about as if he was a born rebel and took so
little interest in his only son Fanny considered him a bear and was
ashamed of him but never tried to polish him up a bit and Maud and
he lived together like a cat and dog who did not belong to a happy
family Grandma was the only one who stood by poor old Tom and Polly
more than once discovered him doing something kind for Madam and
seeming very much ashamed when it was found out He was nt respectful
at all he called her the old lady and told her he would nt be
fussed over but when anything was the matter he always went to the
old lady and was very grateful for the fussing Polly liked him for
this and often wanted to speak of it but she had a feeling that it
would nt do for in praising their affection she was reproaching
others with neglect so she held her tongue and thought about it all
the more Grandma was rather neglected too and perhaps that is
the reason why Tom and she were such good friends She was even more
oldfashioned than Polly but people did nt seem to mind it so much in
her as her day was supposed to be over and nothing was expected of her
but to keep out of everybodys way and to be handsomely dressed when
she appeared before people Grandma led a quiet solitary life in her
own rooms full of old furniture pictures books and relics of a past
for which no one cared but herself Her son went up every evening for a
little call was very kind to her and saw that she wanted nothing money
could buy but he was a busy man so intent on getting rich that he
had no time to enjoy what he already possessed Madam never complained
interfered or suggested but there was a sad sort of quietude about
her a wistful look in her faded eyes as if she wanted something which
money could not buy and when children were near she hovered about
them evidently longing to cuddle and caress them as only grandmothers
can Polly felt this and as she missed the homepetting gladly showed
that she liked to see the quiet old face brighten as she entered the
solitary room where few children came except the phantoms of little
sons and daughters who to the motherly heart that loved them never
faded or grew up Polly wished the children would be kinder to grandma
but it was not for her to tell them so although it troubled her a good
deal and she could only try to make up for it by being as dutiful and
affectionate as if their grandma was her own

Another thing that disturbed Polly was the want of exercise To dress
up and parade certain streets for an hour every day to stand talking in
doorways or drive out in a fine carriage was not the sort of exercise
she liked and Fan would take no other Indeed she was so shocked
when Polly one day proposed a run down the mall that her friend never
dared suggest such a thing again At home Polly ran and rode coasted
and skated jumped rope and raked hay worked in her garden and rowed
her boat so no wonder she longed for something more lively than a daily
promenade with a flock of giddy girls who tilted along in highheeled
boots and costumes which made Polly ashamed to be seen with some of
them So she used to slip out alone sometimes when Fanny was absorbed
in novels company or millinery and get fine brisk walks round the
park on the unfashionable side where the babies took their airings or
she went inside to watch the boys coasting and to wish she could coast
too as she did at home She never went far and always came back rosy
and gay

One afternoon just before dinner she felt so tired of doing nothing
that she slipped out for a run It had been a dull day but the sun was
visible now setting brightly below the clouds It was cold but still
and Polly trotted down the smooth snowcovered mall humming to herself
and trying not to feel homesick The coasters were at it with all their
might and she watched them till her longing to join the fun grew
irresistible On the hill some little girls were playing with their
sleds real little girls in warm hoods and coats rubber boots and
mittens and Polly felt drawn toward them in spite of her fear of Fan

I want to go down but I dars nt its so steep said one of these
common children as Maud called them

If youll lend me your sled and sit in my lap Ill take you down
all nice answered Polly in a confidential tone

The little girls took a look at her seemed satisfied and accepted
her offer Polly looked carefully round to see that no fashionable eye
beheld the awful deed and finding all safe settled her freight and
spun away down hill feeling all over the delightsome excitement of
swift motion which makes coasting such a favorite pastime with the more
sensible portion of the childworld One after another she took
the little girls down the hill and dragged them up again while they
regarded her in the light of a graycoated angel descended for their
express benefit Polly was just finishing off with one delicious go
all by herself when she heard a familiar whistle behind her and before
she could get off up came Tom looking as much astonished as if he had
found her mounted on an elephant

Hullo Polly Whatll Fan say to you was his polished salutation

Dont know and dont care Coasting is no harm I like it and Im
going to do it now Ive got a chance so clear the lulla And
away went independent Polly with her hair blowing in the wind and an
expression of genuine enjoyment which a very red nose did nt damage in
the least

Good for you Polly And casting himself upon his sled with the most
reckless disregard for his ribs off whizzed Tom after her and came
alongside just as she reined up General Grant on the broad path below
Oh wont you get it when we go home cried the young gentleman even
before he changed his graceful attitude

I shant if you dont go and tell but of course you will added
Polly sitting still while an anxious expression began to steal over
her happy face

I just wont then returned Tom with the natural perversity of his
tribe

If they ask me I shall tell of course if they dont ask I think
theres no harm in keeping still I should nt have done it if I had
nt known my mother was willing but I dont wish to trouble your mother
by telling of it Do you think it was very dreadful of me asked Polly
looking at him

I think it was downright jolly and I wont tell if you dont want me
to Now come up and have another said Tom heartily

Just one more the little girls want to go this is their sled

Letem take it it is nt good for much and you come on mine
Mazeppas a stunner you see if he is nt

So Polly tucked herself up in front Tom hung on behind in some
mysterious manner and Mazeppa proved that he fully merited his masters
sincere if inelegant praise They got on capitally now for Tom was in
his proper sphere and showed his best side being civil and gay in the
bluff boyfashion that was natural to him while Polly forgot to be shy
and liked this sort of toughening much better than the other They
laughed and talked and kept taking just one more till the sunshine
was all gone and the clocks struck dinnertime

We shall be late lets run said Polly as they came into the path
after the last coast

You just sit still and Ill get you home in a jiffy and before she
could unpack herself Tom trotted off with her at a fine pace

Heres a pair of cheeks I wish youd get a color like this Fanny
said Mr Shaw as Polly came into the diningroom after smoothing her
hair

Your nose is as red as that cranberry sauce answered Fan coming out
of the big chair where she had been curled up for an hour or two deep
in Lady Audleys Secret

So it is said Polly shutting one eye to look at the offending
feature Never mind Ive had a good time anyway she added giving
a little prance in her chair

I dont see much fun in these cold runs you are so fond of taking
said Fanny with a yawn and a shiver

Perhaps you would if you tried it and Polly laughed as she glanced at
Tom

Did you go alone dear asked grandma patting the rosy cheek beside
her

Yesm but I met Tom and we came home together Pollys eyes
twinkled when she said that and Tom choked in his soup

Thomas leave the table commanded Mr Shaw as his incorrigible son
gurgled and gasped behind his napkin

Please dont send him away sir I made him laugh said Polly
penitently

Whats the joke asked Fanny waking up at last

I should nt think youd make him laugh when hes always making you
cwy observed Maud who had just come in

What have you been doing now sir demanded Mr Shaw as Tom emerged
red and solemn from his brief obscurity

Nothing but coast he said gruffly for papa was always lecturing
him and letting the girls do just as they liked

Sos Polly I saw her Me and Blanche were coming home just now and
we saw her and Tom widing down the hill on his sled and then he dwagged
her ever so far cried Maud with her mouth full

You did nt and Fanny dropped her fork with a scandalized face

Yes I did and liked it ever so much answered Polly looking anxious
but resolute

Did any one see you cried Fanny

Only some little girls and Tom

It was horridly improper and Tom ought to have told you so if you did
nt know any better I should be mortified to death if any of my friends
saw you added Fan much disturbed

Now dont you scold Its no harm and Polly shall coast if she wants
to may nt she grandma cried Tom gallantly coming to the rescue
and securing a powerful ally

My mother lets me and if I dont go among the boys I cant see what
harm there is in it said Polly before Madam could speak

People do many things in the country that are not proper here began
Mrs Shaw in her reproving tone

Let the child do it if she likes and take Maud with her I should be
glad to have one hearty girl in my house interrupted Mr Shaw and
that was the end of it

Thank you sir said Polly gratefully and nodded at Tom who
telegraphed back All right and fell upon his dinner with the appetite
of a young wolf

Oh you slyboots youre getting up a flirtation with Tom are you
whispered Fanny to her friend as if much amused

What and Polly looked so surprised and indignant that Fanny was
ashamed of herself and changed the subject by telling her mother she
needed some new gloves

Polly was very quiet after that and the minute dinner was over she
left the room to go and have a quiet think about the whole matter
Before she got halfway up stairs she saw Tom coming after and
immediately sat down to guard her feet He laughed and said as he
perched himself on the post of the banisters I wont grab you honor
bright I just wanted to say if youll come out tomorrow some time
well have a good coast

No said Polly I cant come

Why not Are you mad I did nt tell And Tom looked amazed at the
change which had come over her

No you kept your word and stood by me like a good boy Im not mad
either but I dont mean to coast any more Your mother dont like it

That is nt the reason I know You nodded to me after shed freed her
mind and you meant to go then Come now what is it

I shant tell you but Im not going was Pollys determined answer

Well I did think you had more sense than most girls but you have nt
and I would nt give a sixpence for you

Thats polite said Polly getting ruffled

Well I hate cowards

I aint a coward

Yes you are Youre afraid of what folks will say aint you now

Polly knew she was and held her peace though she longed to speak but
how could she

Ah I knew youd back out And Tom walked away with an air of scorn
that cut Polly to the heart

Its too bad Just as he was growing kind to me and I was going to
have a good time its all spoilt by Fans nonsense Mrs Shaw dont
like it nor grandma either I dare say Therell be a fuss if I go
and Fan will plague me so Ill give it up and let Tom think Im
afraid Oh dear I never did see such ridiculous people

Polly shut her door hard and felt ready to cry with vexation that her
pleasure should be spoilt by such a silly idea for of all the silly
freaks of this fast age that of little people playing at love is about
the silliest Polly had been taught that it was a very serious and
sacred thing and according to her notions it was far more improper to
flirt with one boy than to coast with a dozen She had been much amazed
only the day before to hear Maud say to her mother Mamma must I have
a beau The girls all do and say I ought to have Fweddy Lovell but I
dont like him as well as Hawry Fiske

Oh yes Id have a little sweetheart dear its so cunning
answered Mrs Shaw And Maud announced soon after that she was engaged
to Fweddycause Hawry slapped her when she proposed the match

Polly laughed with the rest at the time but when she thought of it
afterward and wondered what her own mother would have said if little
Kitty had put such a question she did nt find it cunning or funny but
ridiculous and unnatural She felt so now about herself and when her
first petulance was over resolved to give up coasting and everything
else rather than have any nonsense with Tom who thanks to his
neglected education was as ignorant as herself of the charms of this
new amusement for schoolchildren So Polly tried to console herself
by jumping rope in the backyard and playing tag with Maud in the
dryingroom where she likewise gave lessons in nasgimnics as Maud
called it which did that little person good Fanny came up sometimes
to teach them a new dancing step and more than once was betrayed into
a game of romps for which she was none the worse But Tom turned a cold
shoulder to Polly and made it evident by his cavalier manner that he
really did nt think her worth a sixpence

Another thing that troubled Polly was her clothes for though no one
said anything she knew they were very plain and now and then she
wished that her blue and mouse colored merinos were rather more trimmed
her sashes had bigger bows and her little ruffles more lace on them
She sighed for a locket and for the first time in her life thought
seriously of turning up her pretty curls and putting on a wad She
kept these discontents to herself however after she had written to ask
her mother if she might have her best dress altered like Fannys and
received this reply No dear the dress is proper and becoming as it
is and the old fashion of simplicity the best for all of us I dont
want my Polly to be loved for her clothes but for herself so wear the
plain frocks mother took such pleasure in making for you and let the
panniers go The least of us have some influence in this big world
and perhaps my little girl can do some good by showing others that a
contented heart and a happy face are better ornaments than any Paris can
give her You want a locket deary so I send one that my mother gave me
years ago You will find fathers face on one side mine on the other
and when things trouble you just look at your talisman and I think the
sunshine will come back again

Of course it did for the best of all magic was shut up in the quaint
little case that Polly wore inside her frock and kissed so tenderly
each night and morning The thought that insignificant as she was she
yet might do some good made her very careful of her acts and words and
so anxious to keep head contented and face happy that she forgot her
clothes and made others do the same She did not know it but that good
old fashion of simplicity made the plain gowns pretty and the grace of
unconsciousness beautified their little wearer with the charm that
makes girlhood sweetest to those who truly love and reverence it One
temptation Polly had already yielded to before the letter came and
repented heartily of afterward

Polly I wish youd let me call you Marie said Fanny one day as
they were shopping together

You may call me Mary if you like but I wont have any ie put on to my
name Im Polly at home and Im fond of being called so but Marie is
Frenchified and silly

I spell my own name with an ie and so do all the girls

And what a jumble of Netties Nellies Hatties and Sallies there is
How Pollie would look spelt so

Well never mind that was nt what I began to say Theres one thing
you must have and that is bronze boots said Fan impressively

Why must I when Ive got enough without

Because its the fashion to have them and you cant be finished off
properly without Im going to get a pair and so must you

Dont they cost a great deal

Eight or nine dollars I believe I have mine charged but it dont
matter if you have nt got the money I can lend you some

Ive got ten dollars to do what I like with but its meant to get
some presents for the children And Polly took out her purse in an
undecided way

You can make presents easy enough Grandma knows all sorts of nice
contrivances Theyll do just as well and then you can get your
boots

Well Ill look at them said Polly following Fanny into the store
feeling rather rich and important to be shopping in this elegant manner

Are nt they lovely Your foot is perfectly divine in that boot Polly
Get them for my party youll dance like a fairy whispered Fan

Polly surveyed the dainty shining boot with the scalloped top the
jaunty heel and the delicate toe thought her foot did look very well
in it and after a little pause said she would have them It was all
very delightful till she got home and was alone then on looking into
her purse she saw one dollar and the list of things she meant to get
for mother and the children How mean the dollar looked all alone and
how long the list grew when there was nothing to buy the articles

I cant make skates for Ned nor a desk for Will and those are what
they have set their hearts upon Fathers book and mothers collar are
impossible now and Im a selfish thing to go and spend all my
money for myself How could I do it And Polly eyed the new boots
reproachfully as they stood in the first position as if ready for the
party They are lovely but I dont believe they will feel good for
I shall be thinking about my lost presents all the time sighed Polly
pushing the enticing boots out of sight Ill go and ask grandma what
I can do for if Ive got to make something for every one I must begin
right away or I shant get done and off she bustled glad to forget
her remorse in hard work

Grandma proved equal to the emergency and planned something for every
one supplying materials taste and skill in the most delightful
manner Polly felt much comforted but while she began to knit a pretty
pair of white bedsocks to be tied with rosecolored ribbons for
her mother she thought some very sober thoughts upon the subject of
temptation and if any one had asked her just then what made her sigh
as if something lay heavy on her conscience she would have answered
Bronze boots




CHAPTER IV LITTLE THINGS


ITS so wainy I cant go out and evwybody is so cwoss they wont
play with me said Maud when Polly found her fretting on the stairs
and paused to ask the cause of her wails

Ill play with you only dont scream and wake your mother What shall
we play

I dont know Im tired of evwythingcause my toys are all bwoken
and my dolls are all sick but Clawa moaned Maud giving a jerk to the
Paris doll which she held upside down by one leg in the most unmaternal
manner

Im going to dress a dolly for my little sister would nt you like
to see me do it asked Polly persuasively hoping to beguile the cross
child and finish her own work at the same time

No I should ntcause shell look nicer than my Clawa Her clothes
wont come off and Tom spoiltem playing ball with her in the yard

Would nt you like to rip these clothes off and have me show you how
to make some new ones so you can dress and undress Clara as much as you
like

Yes I love to cut And Mauds face brightened for destructiveness
is one of the earliest traits of childhood and ripping was Mauds
delight

Establishing themselves in the deserted diningroom the children fell
to work and when Fanny discovered them Maud was laughing with all
her heart at poor Clara who denuded of her finery was cutting up all
sorts of capers in the hands of her merry little mistress

I should think youd be ashamed to play with dolls Polly I have nt
touched one this ever so long said Fanny looking down with a superior
air

I aint ashamed for it keeps Maud happy and will please my sister
Kitty and I think sewing is better than prinking or reading silly
novels so now And Polly stitched away with a resolute air for she
and Fanny had had a little tiff because Polly would nt let her friend
do up her hair like other folks and bore her ears

Dont be cross dear but come and do something nice its so dull
today said Fanny anxious to be friends again for it was doubly dull
without Polly

Cant Im busy

You always are busy I never saw such a girl What in the world do you
find to do all the time asked Fanny watching with interest the set of
the little red merino frock Polly was putting on to her doll

Lots of things but I like to be lazy sometimes as much as you do just
lie on the sofa and read fairy stories or think about nothing Would
you have a whitemuslin apron or a black silk added Polly surveying
her work with satisfaction

Muslin with pockets and tiny blue bows Ill show you how And
forgetting her hate and contempt for dolls down sat Fanny soon getting
as much absorbed as either of the others

The dull day brightened wonderfully after that and the time flew
pleasantly as tongues and needles went together Grandma peeped in and
smiled at the busy group saying Sew away my dears dollies are safe
companions and needlework an accomplishment thats sadly neglected
nowadays Small stitches Maud neat buttonholes Fan cut carefully
Polly and dont waste your cloth Take pains and the best needlewoman
shall have a pretty bit of white satin for a dolls bonnet

Fanny exerted herself and won the prize for Polly helped Maud and
neglected her own work but she did nt care much for Mr Shaw said
looking at the three bright faces at the teatable I guess Polly has
been making sunshine for you today No indeed sir I have nt done
anything only dress Mauds doll

And Polly did nt think she had done much but it was one of the little
things which are always waiting to be done in this world of ours where
rainy days come so often where spirits get out of tune and duty wont
go hand in hand with pleasure Little things of this sort are especially
good work for little people a kind little thought an unselfish little
act a cheery little word are so sweet and comfortable that no one can
fail to feel their beauty and love the giver no matter how small they
are Mothers do a deal of this sort of thing unseen unthanked but
felt and remembered long afterward and never lost for this is the
simple magic that binds hearts together and keeps home happy Polly had
learned this secret

She loved to do the little things that others did not see or were too
busy to stop for and while doing them without a thought of thanks she
made sunshine for herself as well as others There was so much love
in her own home that she quickly felt the want of it in Fannys and
puzzled herself to find out why these people were not kind and patient
to one another She did not try to settle the question but did her
best to love and serve and bear with each and the good will the gentle
heart the helpful ways and simple manners of our Polly made her dear
to every one for these virtues even in a little child are lovely and
attractive

Mr Shaw was very kind to her for he liked her modest respectful
manners and Polly was so grateful for his many favors that she soon
forgot her fear and showed her affection in all sorts of confiding
little ways which pleased him extremely She used to walk across the
park with him when he went to his office in the morning talking busily
all the way and saying Goodby with a nod and a smile when they
parted at the great gate At first Mr Shaw did not care much about
it but soon he missed her if she did not come and found that
something fresh and pleasant seemed to brighten all his day if a small
graycoated figure with an intelligent face a merry voice and a
little hand slipped confidingly into his went with him through the
wintry park Coming home late he liked to see a curly brown head
watching at the window to find his slippers ready his paper in its
place and a pair of willing feet eager to wait upon him I wish my
Fanny was more like her he often said to himself as he watched the
girls while they thought him deep in politics or the state of the money
market Poor Mr Shaw had been so busy getting rich that he had not
found time to teach his children to love him he was more at leisure
now and as his boy and girls grew up he missed something Polly was
unconsciously showing him what it was and making childlove so sweet
that he felt he could not do without it any more yet did nt quite
know how to win the confidence of the children who had always found him
busy indifferent and absentminded

As the girls were going to bed one night Polly kissed grandma as
usual and Fanny laughed at her saying What a baby you are We are
too old for such things now

I dont think people ever are too old to kiss their fathers and
mothers was the quick answer

Right my little Polly and Mr Shaw stretched out his hand to her
with such a kindly look that Fanny stared surprised and then said
shyly I thought you did nt care about it father I do my dear
And Mr Shaw put out the other hand to Fanny who gave him a daughterly
kiss quite forgetting everything but the tender feeling that sprung up
in her heart at the renewal of the childish custom which we never need
outgrow

Mrs Shaw was a nervous fussy invalid who wanted something every five
minutes so Polly found plenty of small things to do for her and did
them so cheerfully that the poor lady loved to have the quiet helpful
child near to wait upon her read to her run errands or hand the
seven different shawls which were continually being put on or off

Grandma too was glad to find willing hands and feet to serve her and
Polly passed many happy hours in the quaint rooms learning all sorts
of pretty arts and listening to pleasant chat never dreaming how much
sunshine she brought to the solitary old lady

Tom was Pollys rock ahead for a long time because he was always
breaking out in a new place and one never knew where to find him He
tormented yet amused her was kind one day and a bear the next at
times she fancied he was never going to be bad again and the next thing
she knew he was deep in mischief and hooted at the idea of repentance
and reformation Polly gave him up as a hard case but was so in the
habit of helping any one who seemed in trouble that she was good to him
simply because she could nt help it

Whats the matter Is your lesson too hard for you she asked one
evening as a groan made her look across the table to where Tom sat
scowling over a pile of dilapidated books with his hands in his hair
as if his head was in danger of flying asunder with the tremendous
effort he was making

Hard Guess it is What in thunder do I care about the old
Carthaginians Regulus was nt bad but Im sick of him And Tom dealt
Harknesss Latin Reader a thump which expressed his feelings better
than words

I like Latin and used to get on well when I studied it with Jimmy
Perhaps I can help you a little bit said Polly as Tom wiped his hot
face and refreshed himself with a peanut

You pooh girls Latin dont amount to much anyway was the grateful
reply

But Polly was used to him now and nothing daunted took a look at the
grimy page in the middle of which Tom had stuck She read it so well
that the young gentleman stopped munching to regard her with respectful
astonishment and when she stopped he said suspiciously You are a
sly one Polly to study up so you can show off before me But it wont
do maam turn over a dozen pages and try again

Polly obeyed and did even better than before saying as she looked up
with a laugh Ive been through the whole book so you wont catch me
that way Tom

I say how came you to know such a lot asked Tom much impressed

I studied with Jimmy and kept up with him for father let us be
together in all our lessons It was so nice and we learned so fast

Tell me about Jimmy Hes your brother is nt he

Yes but hes dead you know Ill tell about him some other time
you ought to study now and perhaps I can help you said Polly with a
little quiver of the lips

Should nt wonder if you could And Tom spread the book between them
with a grave and businesslike air for he felt that Polly had got the
better of him and it behooved him to do his best for the honor of his
sex He went at the lesson with a will and soon floundered out of his
difficulties for Polly gave him a lift here and there and they went
on swimmingly till they came to some rules to be learned Polly had
forgotten them so they both committed them to memory Tom with
hands in his pockets rocked to and fro muttering rapidly while Polly
twisted the little curl on her forehead and stared at the wall gabbling
with all her might

Done cried Tom presently

Done echoed Polly and then they heard each other recite till both
were perfect Thats pretty good fun said Tom joyfully tossing poor
Harkness away and feeling that the pleasant excitement of companionship
could lend a charm even to Latin Grammar

Now maam well take a turn at algibbera I like that as much as I
hate Latin

Polly accepted the invitation and soon owned that Tom could beat her
here This fact restored his equanimity but he did nt crow over her
far from it for he helped her with a paternal patience that made
her eyes twinkle with suppressed fun as he soberly explained and
illustrated unconsciously imitating Dominie Deane till Polly found it
difficult to keep from laughing in his face

You may have another go at it any time you like generously remarked
Tom as he shied the algebra after the Latin Reader

Ill come every evening then Id like to for I have nt studied a
bit since I came You shall try and make me like algebra and Ill try
and make you like Latin will you

Oh Id like it well enough if there was any one explain it to me
Old Deane puts us through doublequick and dont give a fellow time to
ask questions when we read

Ask your father he knows

Dont believe he does should nt dare to bother him if he did

Why not

Hed pull my ears and call me astupid or tell me not to worry
him

I dont think he would Hes very kind to me and I ask lots of
questions

He likes you better than he does me

Now Tom its wrong of you to say so Of course he loves you ever so
much more than he does me cried Polly reprovingly

Why dont he show it then muttered Tom with a halfwistful
halfdefiant glance toward the library door which stood ajar

You act so how can he asked Polly after a pause in which she put
Toms question to herself and could find no better reply than the one
she gave him

Why dont he give me my velocipede He said if I did well at school
for a month I should have it and Ive been pegging away like fury for
most six weeks and he dont do a thing about it The girls get their
duds because they tease I wont do that anyway but you dont catch me
studying myself to death and no pay for it

It is too bad but you ought to do it because its right and
never mind being paid began Polly trying to be moral but secretly
sympathizing heartily with poor Tom

Dont you preach Polly If the governor took any notice of me and
cared how I got on I would nt mind the presents so much but he dont
care a hang and never even asked if I did well last declamation day
when Id gone and learned The Battle of Lake Regillus because he
said he liked it

Oh Tom Did you say that Its splendid Jim and I used to say
Horatius together and it was such fun Do speak your piece to me I do
so like Macaulays Lays

Its dreadful long began Tom but his face brightened for Pollys
interest soothed his injured feelings and he was glad to prove his
elocutionary powers He began without much spirit but soon the martial
ring of the lines fired him and before he knew it he was on his legs
thundering away in grand style while Polly listened with kindling
face and absorbed attention Tom did declaim well for he quite forgot
himself and delivered the stirring ballad with an energy that
made Polly flush and tingle with admiration and delight and quite
electrified a second listener who had heard all that went on and
watched the little scene from behind his newspaper

As Tom paused breathless and Polly clapped her hands enthusiastically
the sound was loudly echoed from behind him Both whirled round and
there was Mr Shaw standing in the doorway applauding with all his
might

Tom looked much abashed and said not a word Polly ran to Mr Shaw and
danced before him saying eagerly Was nt it splendid Did nt he do
well May nt he have his velocipede now

Capital Tom youll be an orator yet Learn another piece like that
and Ill come and hear you speak it Are you ready for your velocipede
hey

Polly was right and Tom owned that the governor was kind did like
him and had nt entirely forgotten his promise The boy turned red with
pleasure and picked at the buttons on his jacket while listening to
this unexpected praise but when he spoke he looked straight up in his
fathers face while his own shone with pleasure as he answered in one
breath Thankee sir Ill do it sir Guess I am sir

Very good then look out for your new horse tomorrow sir And Mr
Shaw stroked the fuzzy red head with a kind hand feeling a fatherly
pleasure in the conviction that there was something in his boy after
all

Tom got his velocipede next day named it Black Auster in memory of the
horse in The Battle of Lake Regillus and came to grief as soon as he
began to ride his new steed

Come out and see me go it whispered Tom to Polly after three days
practice in the street for he had already learned to ride in the rink

Polly and Maud willingly went and watched his struggles with
deep interest till he got an upset which nearly put an end to his
velocipeding forever

Hi there Austers coming shouted Tom as came rattling down the
long steep street outside the park

They stepped aside and he whizzed by arms and legs going like mad
with the general appearance of a runaway engine It would have been a
triumphant descent if a big dog had not bounced suddenly through one of
the openings and sent the whole concern helterskelter into the gutter
Polly laughed as she ran to view the ruin for Tom lay flat on his back
with the velocipede atop him while the big dog barked wildly and his
master scolded him for his awkwardness But when she saw Toms face
Polly was frightened for the color had all gone out of it his eyes
looked strange and dizzy and drops of blood began to trickle from a
great cut on his forehead The man saw it too and had him up in a
minute but he could nt stand and stared about him in a dazed sort of
way as he sat on the curbstone while Polly held her handkerchief to
his forehead and pathetically begged to know if he was killed

Dont scare mother Im all right Got upset did nt I he asked
presently eyeing the prostrate velocipede with more anxiety about its
damages than his own

I knew youd hurt yourself with that horrid thing just let it be and
come home for your head bleeds dreadfully and everybody is looking
at us whispered Polly trying to tie the little handkerchief over the
ugly cut

Come on then Jove how queer my head feels Give us a boost please
Stop howling Maud and come home You bring the machine and Ill pay
you Pat As he spoke Tom slowly picked himself and steadying himself
by Pollys shoulder issued commands and the procession fell into
line First the big dog barking at intervals then the goodnatured
Irishman trundling that divil of a whirligig as he disrespectfully
called the idolized velocipede then the wounded hero supported by the
helpful Polly and Maud brought up the rear in tears bearing Toms cap

Unfortunately Mrs Shaw was out driving with grandma and Fanny was
making calls so that there was no one but Polly to stand by Tom for
the parlormaid turned faint at the sight of blood and the chambermaid
lost her wits in the flurry It was a bad cut and must be sewed up
at once the doctor said as soon as he came Somebody must hold his
head he added as he threaded his queer little needle

Ill keep still but if anybody must hold me let Polly You aint
afraid are you asked Tom with imploring look for he did nt like
the idea of being sewed a bit

Polly was just going to shrink away saying Oh I cant when she
remembered that Tom once called her a coward Here was a chance to prove
that she was nt besides poor Tom had no one else to help him so she
came up to the sofa where he lay and nodded reassuringly as she put a
soft little hand on either side of the damaged head

You are a trump Polly whispered Tom Then he set his teeth clenched
his hands lay quite still and bore it like a man It was all over in
a minute or two and when he had had a glass of wine and was nicely
settled on his bed he felt pretty comfortable in spite of the pain in
his head and being ordered to keep quiet he said Thank you ever so
much Polly and watched her with a grateful face as she crept away

He had to keep the house for a week and laid about looking very
interesting with a great black patch on his forehead Every onepetted
him for the doctor said that if the blow had been an inch nearer
the temple it would have been fatal and the thought of losing him so
suddenly made bluff old Tom very precious all at once His father asked
him how he was a dozen times a day his mother talked continually of
that dear boys narrow escape and grandma cockered him up with every
delicacy she could invent and the girls waited on him like devoted
slaves This new treatment had an excellent effect for when neglected
Tom got over his first amazement at this change of base he blossomed
out delightfully as sick people do sometimes and surprised his family
by being unexpectedly patient grateful and amiable Nobody ever knew
how much good it did him for boys seldom have confidences of this sort
except with their mothers and Mrs Shaw had never found the key to her
sons heart But a little seed was sowed then that took root and though
it grew very slowly it came to something in the end Perhaps Polly
helped it a little Evening was his hardest time for want of exercise
made him as restless and nervous as it was possible for a hearty lad to
be on such a short notice

He could nt sleep so the girls amused him Fanny played and read aloud
Polly sung and told stories and did the latter so well that it got
to be a regular thing for her to begin as soon as twilight came and Tom
was settled in his favorite place on grandmas sofa

Fire away Polly said the young sultan one evening as his little
Scheherazade sat down in her low chair after stirring up the fire till
the room was bright and cosy

I dont feel like stories tonight Tom Ive told all I know and
cant make up any more answered Polly leaning her head on her hand
with a sorrowful look that Tom had never seen before He watched her a
minute and then asked curiously What were you thinking about just
now when you sat staring at the fire and getting soberer and soberer
every minute

I was thinking about Jimmy

Would you mind telling about him You know you said you would some
time but dont if youd rather not said Tom lowering his rough
voice respectfully

I like to talk about him but there is nt much to tell began Polly
grateful for his interest Sitting here with you reminded me of the
way I used to sit with him when he was sick We used to have such happy
times and its so pleasant to think about them now

He was awfully good was nt he

No he was nt but he tried to be and mother says that is half the
battle We used to get tired of trying but we kept making resolutions
and working hard to keepem I dont think I got on much but Jimmy
did and every one loved him

Did nt you ever squabble as we do

Yes indeed sometimes but we could nt stay mad and always made it
up again as soon as we could Jimmy used to come round first and say
All serene Polly so kind and jolly that I could nt help laughing
and being friends right away

Did he not know a lot

Yes I think he did for he liked to study and wanted to get on so
he could help father People used to call him a fine boy and I felt so
proud to hear it but they did nt know half how wise he was because
he did nt show off a bit I suppose sisters always are grand of their
brothers but I dont believe many girls had as much right to be as I
had

Most girls dont care two pins about their brothers so that shows you
dont know much about it

Well they ought to if they dont and they would if the boys were as
kind to them as Jimmy was to me

Why what did he do

Loved me dearly and was nt ashamed to show it cried Polly with a
sob in her voice that made her answer very eloquent

What made him die Polly asked Tom soberly after little pause

He got hurt coasting last winter but he never told which boy did
it and he only lived a week I helped take care of him and he was so
patient I used to wonder at him for he was in dreadful pain all time
He gave me his books and his dog and his speckled hens and his big
knife and said Goodby Polly and kissed me the last thing and then
O Jimmy Jimmy If he only could come back

Poor Pollys eyes had been getting fuller and fuller lips trembling
more and more as she went on when she came to that goodby she
could nt get any further but covered up her face and cried as her
heart would break Tom was full of sympathy but did nt know how to
show it so he sat shaking up the camphor bottle and trying to think of
something proper and comfortable to say when Fanny came to the rescue
and cuddled Polly in her arms with soothing little pats and whispers
and kisses till the tears stopped and Polly said she did nt mean
to and would nt any more Ive been thinking about my dear boy all
the evening for Tom reminds me of him she added with a sigh

Me How can I when I aint a bit like him cried Tom amazed

But you are in some ways

Wish I was but I cant be for he was good you know

So are you when you choose Has nt he been good and patient and
dont we all like to pet him when hes clever Fan said Polly whose
heart was still aching for her brother and ready for his sake to find
virtues even in tormenting Tom

Yes I dont know the boy lately but hell be as bad as ever when
hes well returned Fanny who had nt much faith in sickbed
repentances

Much you know about it growled Tom lying down again for he had sat
bolt upright when Polly made the astounding declaration that he was
like the wellbeloved Jimmy That simple little history had made a deep
impression on Tom and the tearful ending touched the tender spot
that most boys hide so carefully It is very pleasant to be loved and
admired very sweet to think we shall be missed and mourned when we die
and Tom was seized with a sudden desire to imitate this boy who had nt
done anything wonderful yet was so dear to his sister that she cried
for him a whole year after he was dead so studious and clever the
people called him a fine fellow and so anxious to be good that he
kept on trying till he was better even than Polly whom Tom privately
considered a model of virtue as girls go

I just wish I had a sister like you he broke out all of a sudden

And I just wish I had a brother like Jim cried Fanny for she felt
the reproach in Toms words and knew she deserved it

I should nt think youd envy anybody for youve got one another
said Polly with such a wistful look that it suddenly set Tom and Fanny
to wondering why they did nt have better times together and enjoy
themselves as Polly and Jim did

Fan dont care for anybody but herself said Tom

Tom is such a bear retorted Fanny

I would nt say such things for if anything should happen to either of
you the other one would feel so sorry Every cross word I ever said to
Jimmy comes back now and makes me wish I had nt

Two great tears rolled down Pollys cheeks and were quietly wiped away
but I think they watered that sweet sentiment called fraternal love
which till now had been neglected in the hearts of this brother and
sister They did nt say anything then or make any plans or confess
any faults but when they parted for the night Fanny gave the wounded
head a gentle pat Tom never would have forgiven her if she had kissed
him and said in a whisper I hope youll have a good sleep Tommy
dear

And Tom nodded back at her with a hearty Same to you Fan

That was all but it meant a good deal for the voices were kind
and the eyes met full of that affection which makes words of little
consequence Polly saw it and though she did nt know that she had
made the sunshine it shone back upon her so pleasantly that she fell
happily asleep though her Jimmy was nt there to say goodnight




CHAPTER V SCRAPES


AFTER being unusually good children are apt to turn short round and
refresh themselves by acting like Sancho For a week after Toms mishap
the young folks were quite angelic so much so that grandma said she was
afraid something was going to happen to them The dear old lady need
nt have felt anxious for such excessive virtue does nt last long
enough to lead to translation except with little prigs in the goody
storybooks and no sooner was Tom on his legs again when the whole
party went astray and much tribulation was the consequence

It all began with Pollys stupidity as Fan said afterward Just as
Polly ran down to meet Mr Shaw one evening and was helping him off
with his coat the bell rang and a fine bouquet of hothouse flowers was
left in Pollys hands for she never could learn city ways and opened
the door herself

Hey whats this My little Polly is beginning early after all said
Mr Shaw laughing as he watched the girls face dimple and flush as
she smelt the lovely nosegay and glanced at a note half hidden in the
heliotrope

Now if Polly had nt been stupid as Fan said she would have had
her wits about her and let it pass but you see Polly was an honest
little soul and it never occurred to her that there was any need of
concealment so she answered in her straightforward way Oh they aint
for me sir they are for Fan from Mr Frank I guess Shell be so
pleased

That puppy sends her things of this sort does he And Mr Shaw looked
far from pleased as he pulled out the note and coolly opened it

Polly had her doubts about Fans approval of that sort of thing but
dared not say a word and stood thinking how she used to show her father
the funny valentines the boys sent her and how they laughed over them
together But Mr Shaw did not laugh when he had read the sentimental
verses accompanying the bouquet and his face quite scared Polly as he
asked angrily How long has this nonsense been going on

Indeed sir I dont know Fan does nt mean any harm I wish I had nt
said anything stammered Polly remembering the promise given to Fanny
the day of the concert She had forgotten all about it and had become
accustomed to see the big boys as she called Mr Frank and his
friends with the girls on all occasions Now it suddenly occurred to
her that Mr Shaw did nt like such amusements and had forbidden Fan to
indulge in them Oh dear how mad she will be Well I cant help it
Girls should nt have secrets from their fathers then there would nt
be any fuss thought Polly as she watched Mr Shaw twist up the pink
note and poke it back among the flowers which he took from her saying
shortly Send Fanny to me in the library

Now youve done it you stupid thing cried Fanny both angry and
dismayed when Polly delivered the message

Why what else could I do asked Polly much disturbed

Let him think the bouquet was for you then thered have been no
trouble

But that would have been doing a lie which is most as bad as telling
one

Dont be a goose Youve got me into a scrape and you ought to help
me out

I will if I can but I wont tell lies for anybody cried Polly
getting excited

Nobody wants you to just hold your tongue and let me manage

Then Id better not go down began Polly when a stern voice from
below called like Bluebeard Are you coming down

Yes sir answered a meek voice and Fanny clutched Polly whispering
You must come Im frightened out of my wits when he speaks like that
Stand by me Polly theres a dear

I will whispered sister Ann and down they went with fluttering
hearts

Mr Shaw stood on the rug looking rather grim the bouquet lay on the
table and beside it a note directed to Frank Moore Esq in a very
decided hand with a fiercelooking flourish after the Esq Pointing
to this impressive epistle Mr Shaw said knitting his black eyebrows
as he looked at Fanny Im going to put a stop to this nonsense
at once and if I see any more of it Ill send you to school in a
Canadian convent

This awful threat quite took Pollys breath away but Fanny had heard it
before and having a temper of her own said pertly Im sure I have
nt done anything so very dreadful I cant help it if the boys send me
philopena presents as they do to the other girls

There was nothing about philopenas in the note But thats not the
question I forbid you to have anything to do with this Moore Hes not
a boy but a fast fellow and I wont have him about You knew this and
yet disobeyed me

I hardly ever see him began Fanny

Is that true asked Mr Shaw turning suddenly to Polly

Oh please sir dont ask me I promised I would nt that is Fanny
will tell you cried Polly quite red with distress at the predicament
she was in

No matter about your promise tell me all you know of this absurd
affair It will do Fanny more good than harm And Mr Shaw sat down
looking more amiable for Pollys dismay touched him

May I she whispered to Fanny

I dont care answered Fan looking both angry and ashamed as she
stood sullenly tying knots in her handkerchief

So Polly told with much reluctance and much questioning all she knew
of the walks the lunches the meetings and the notes It was nt much
and evidently less serious than Mr Shaw expected for as he listened
his eyebrows smoothed themselves out and more than once his lips
twitched as if he wanted to laugh for after all it was rather comical
to see how the young people aped their elders playing the newfashioned
game quite unconscious of its real beauty power and sacredness

Oh please sir dont blame Fan much for she truly is nt half as
silly as Trix and the other girls She would nt go sleighriding
though Mr Frank teased and she wanted to ever so much Shes sorry
I know and wont forget what you say any more if youll forgive her
this once cried Polly very earnestly when the foolish little story
was told

I dont see how I can help it when you plead so well for her Come
here Fan and mind this one thing drop all this nonsense and attend
to your books or off you go and Canada is no joke in winter time let
me tell you

As he spoke Mr Shaw stroked his sulky daughters cheek hoping to see
some sign of regret but Fanny felt injured and would nt show that
she was sorry so she only said pettishly I suppose I can have my
flowers now the fuss is over

They are going straight back where they came from with a line from me
which will keep that puppy from ever sending you any more Ringing
the bell Mr Shaw despatched the unfortunate posy and then turned to
Polly saying kindly but gravely Set this silly child of mine a good
example and do your best for her wont you

Me What can I do sir asked Polly looking ready but quite ignorant
how to begin

Make her as like yourself as possible my dear nothing would please me
better Now go and let us hear no more of this folly

They went without a word and Mr Shaw heard no more of the affair but
poor Polly did for Fan scolded her till Polly thought seriously of
packing up and going home next day I really have nt the heart to
relate the dreadful lectures she got the snubs she suffered or the
cold shoulders turned upon her for several days after this Pollys
heart was full but she told no one and bore her trouble silently
feeling her friends ingratitude and injustice deeply

Tom found out what the matter was and sided with Polly which
proceeding led to scrape number two

Wheres Fan asked the young gentleman strolling into his sisters
room where Polly lay on the sofa trying to forget her troubles in an
interesting book

Down stairs seeing company

Why did nt you go too

I dont like Trix and I dont know her fine New York friends

Dont want to neither why dont you say

Not polite

Who cares I say Polly come and have some fun

Id rather read

That is nt polite

Polly laughed and turned a page Tom whistled a minute then sighed
deeply and put his hand to his forehead which the black plaster still
adorned

Does your head ache asked Polly

Awfully

Better lie down then

Cant Im fidgety and want to beamoosed as Pug says

Just wait till I finish my chapter and then Ill come said pitiful
Polly

All right returned the perjured boy who had discovered that a broken
head was sometimes more useful than a whole one and exulting in his
base stratagem he roved about the room till Fans bureau arrested him
It was covered with all sorts of finery for she had dressed in a hurry
and left everything topsyturvy A wellconducted boy would have let
things alone or a moral brother would have put things to rights being
neither Tom rummaged to his hearts content till Fans drawers looked
as if some one had been making hay in them He tried the effect of
earrings ribbons and collars wound up the watch though it was nt
time burnt his inquisitive nose with smellingsalts deluged his grimy
handkerchief with Fans best cologne anointed his curly crop with her
hairoil powdered his face with her violetpowder and finished off
by pinning on a bunch of false ringlets which Fanny tried to keep a
profound secret The ravages committed by this bad boy are beyond
the power of language to describe as he revelled in the interesting
drawers boxes and cases which held his sisters treasures

When the curls had been put on with much pricking of fingers and a
blue ribbon added la Fan he surveyed himself with satisfaction and
considered the effect so fine that he was inspired to try a still
greater metamorphosis The dress Fan had taken off lay on a chair
and into it got Tom chuckling with suppressed laughter for Polly
was absorbed and the bedcurtains hid his iniquity Fans best velvet
jacket and hat ermine muff and a sofapillow for pannier finished off
the costume and tripping along with elbows out Tom appeared before
the amazed Polly just as the chapter ended She enjoyed the joke so
heartily that Tom forgot consequences and proposed going down into the
parlor to surprise the girls

Goodness no Fanny never would forgive us if you showed her curls and
things to those people There are gentlemen among them and it would nt
be proper said Polly alarmed at the idea

All the more fun Fan has nt treated you well and it will serve her
right if you introduce me as your dear friend Miss Shaw Come on it
will be a jolly lark

I would nt for the world it would be so mean Takeem off Tom and
Ill play anything else you like

I aint going to dress up for nothing I look so lovely someone must
admire me Take me down Polly and see if they dont call mea sweet
creature

Tom looked so unutterably ridiculous as he tossed his curls and pranced
that Polly went off into another gale of merriment but even while she
laughed she resolved not to let him mortify his sister

Now then get out of the way if you wont come Im going down said
Tom

No youre not

How will you help it Miss Prim

So And Polly locked the door put the key in her pocket and nodded
at him defiantly

Tom was a pepperpot as to temper and anything like opposition always
had a bad effect Forgetting his costume he strode up to Polly saying
with a threatening wag of the head None of that I wont stand it

Promise not to plague Fan and Ill let you out

Wont promise anything Give me that key or Ill make you

Now Tom dont be savage I only want to keep you out of a scrape for
Fan will be raging if you go Take off her things and Ill give up

Tom vouchsafed no reply but marched to the other door which was fast
as Polly knew looked out of the threestory window and finding no
escape possible came back with a wrathful face Will you give me that
key

No I wont said Polly valiantly

Im stronger than you are so youd better hand over

I know you are but its cowardly for a great boy like you to rob a
girl

I dont want to hurt you but by George I wont stand this

Tom paused as Polly spoke evidently ashamed of himself but his temper
was up and he would nt give in If Polly had cried a little just
here he would have yielded unfortunately she giggled for Toms fierce
attitude was such a funny contrast to his dress that she could nt help
it That settled the matter No girl that ever lived should giggle at
him much less lock him up like a small child Without a word he made
a grab at Pollys arm for the hand holding the key was still in her
pocket With her other hand she clutched her frock and for a minute
held on stoutly But Toms strong fingers were irresistible rip went
the pocket out came the hand and with a cry of pain from Polly the
key fell on the floor

Its your own fault if youre hurt I did nt mean to muttered Tom
as he hastily departed leaving Polly to groan over her sprained wrist
He went down but not into the parlor for somehow the joke seemed to
have lost its relish so he made the girls in the kitchen laugh and
then crept up the back way hoping to make it all right with Polly But
she had gone to grandmas room for though the old lady was out it
seemed a refuge He had just time to get things in order when Fanny
came up crosser than ever for Trix had been telling her of all sorts
of fun in which she might have had a share if Polly had held her
tongue

Where is she asked Fan wishing to vent her vexation on her friend

Moping in her room I suppose replied Tom who was discovered reading
studiously

Now while this had been happening Maud had been getting into hot
water also for when her maid left her to see a friend below Miss Maud
paraded into Pollys room and solaced herself with mischief In an evil
hour Polly had let her play boat in her big trunk which stood empty
Since then Polly had stored some of her most private treasures in the
upper tray so that she might feel sure they were safe from all eyes
She had forgotten to lock the trunk and when Maud raised the lid to
begin her voyage several objects of interest met her eyes She was deep
in her researches when Fan came in and looked over her shoulder feeling
too cross with Polly to chide Maud

As Polly had no money for presents she had exerted her ingenuity
to devise all sorts of gifts hoping by quantity to atone for any
shortcomings in quality Some of her attempts were successful others
were failures but she kept them all fine or funny knowing the
children at home would enjoy anything new Some of Mauds castoff toys
had been neatly mended for Kitty some of Fans old ribbons and laces
were converted into dolls finery and Toms little figures whittled
out of wood in idle minutes were laid away to show Will what could be
done with a knife

What rubbish said Fanny

Queer girl is nt she added Tom who had followed to see what was
going on

Dont you laugh at Pollys things She makes nicer dolls than you Fan
and she can wite and dwar ever so much better than Tom cried Maud
How do you know I never saw her draw said Tom

Heres a book with lots of pictures in it I cant wead the witing
but the pictures are so funny

Eager to display her friends accomplishments Maud pulled out a fat
little book marked Pollys Journal and spread it in her lap

Only the pictures no harm in taking a look atem said Tom

Just one peep answered Fanny and the next minute both were laughing
at a droll sketch of Tom in the gutter with the big dog howling over
him and the velocipede running away Very rough and faulty but so
funny that it was evident Pollys sense of humor was strong A few
pages farther back came Fanny and Mr Frank caricatured then grandma
carefully done Tom reciting his battlepiece Mr Shaw and Polly in
the park Maud being borne away by Katy and all the schoolgirls turned
into ridicule with an unsparing hand

Sly little puss to make fun of us behind our backs said Fan rather
nettled by Pollys quiet retaliation for many slights from herself and
friends

She does draw well said Tom looking critically at the sketch of a
boy with a pleasant face round whom Polly had drawn rays like the sun
and under which was written My dear Jimmy

You would nt admire her if you knew what she wrote here about you
said Fanny whose eyes had strayed to the written page opposite and
lingered there long enough to read something that excited her curiosity

What is it asked Tom forgetting his honorable resolves for a minute

She says I try to like Tom and when he is pleasant we do very well
but he dont stay so long He gets cross and rough and disrespectful to
his father and mother and plagues us girls and is so horrid I almost
hate him Its very wrong but I cant help it How do you like that
asked Fanny

Go ahead and see how she comes down on you maam retorted Tom who
had read on a bit

Does she And Fanny continued rapidly As for Fan I dont think
we can be friends any more for she told her father a lie and wont
forgive me for not doing so too I used to think her a very fine girl
but I dont now If she would be as she was when I first knew her I
should love her just the same but she is nt kind to me and though she
is always talking about politeness I dont think it is polite to treat
company as she does me She thinks I am odd and countrified and I dare
say I am but I should nt laugh at a girls clothes because she was
poor or keep her out of the way because she did nt do just as other
girls do here I see her make fun of me and I cant feel as I did and
Id go home only it would seem ungrateful to Mr Shaw and grandma and
I do love them dearly

I say Fan youve got it now Shut the book and come away cried
Tom enjoying this broadside immensely but feeling guilty as well he
might

Just one bit more whispered Fanny turning on a page or two and
stopping at a leaf that was blurred here and there as if tears had
dropped on it

Sunday morning early Nobody is up to spoil my quiet time and I must
write my journal for Ive been so bad lately I could nt bear to do
it Im glad my visit is most done for things worry me here and there
is nt any one to help me get right when I get wrong I used to envy
Fanny but I dont now for her father and mother dont take care of her
as mine do of me She is afraid of her father and makes her mother do
as she likes Im glad I came though for I see money dont give
people everything but Id like a little all the same for it is so
comfortable to buy nice things I read over my journal just now and
Im afraid its not a good one for I have said all sorts of things
about the people here and it is nt kind I should tear it out only I
promised to keep my diary and I want to talk over things that puzzle me
with mother I see now that it is my fault a good deal for I have nt
been half as patient and pleasant as I ought to be I will truly try
for the rest of the time and be as good and grateful as I can for I
want them to like me though Im onlyan oldfashioned country girl

That last sentence made Fanny shut the book with a face full of
selfreproach for she had said those words herself in a fit of
petulance and Polly had made no answer though her eyes filled and her
cheeks burned Fan opened her lips to say something but not a sound
followed for there stood Polly looking at them with an expression they
had never seen before

What are you doing with my things she demanded in a low tone while
her eyes kindled and her color changed

Maud showed us a book she found and we were just looking at the
pictures began Fanny dropping it as if it burnt her fingers

And reading my journal and laughing at my presents and then putting
the blame on Maud Its the meanest thing I ever saw and Ill never
forgive you as long as I live

Polly said this all in one indignant breath and then as if afraid
of saying too much ran out of the room with such a look of mingled
contempt grief and anger that the three culprits stood dumb with
shame Tom had nt even a whistle at his command Maud was so scared at
gentle Pollys outbreak that she sat as still as a mouse while
Fanny conscience stricken laid back the poor little presents with a
respectful hand for somehow the thought of Pollys poverty came over
her as it never had done before and these odds and ends so carefully
treasured up for those at home touched Fanny and grew beautiful in her
eyes As she laid by the little book the confessions in it reproached
her more sharply that any words Polly could have spoken for she had
laughed at her friend had slighted her sometimes and been unforgiving
for an innocent offence That last page where Polly took the blame on
herself and promised to truly try to be more kind and patient went
to Fannys heart melting all the coldness away and she could only lay
her head on the trunk sobbing It was nt Pollys fault it was all
mine

Tom still red with shame at being caught in such a scrape left Fanny
to her tears and went manfully away to find the injured Polly and
confess his manifold transgressions But Polly could nt be found He
searched high and low in every room yet no sign of the girt appeared
and Tom began to get anxious She cant have run away home can she
he said to himself as he paused before the hattree There was the
little round hat and Tom gave it a remorseful smooth remembering how
many times he had tweaked it half off or poked it over poor Pollys
eyes Maybe shes gone down to the office to tell pa T is nt a bit
like her though Anyway Ill take a look round the corner

Eager to get his boots Tom pulled open the door of a dark closet under
the stairs and nearly tumbled over backward with surprise for there
on the floor with her head pillowed on a pair of rubbers lay Polly
in an attitude of despair This mournful spectacle sent Toms penitent
speech straight out of his head and with an astonished Hullo he
stood and stared in impressive silence Polly was nt crying and lay
so still that Tom began to think she might be in a fit or a faint
and bent anxiously down to inspect the pathetic bunch A glimpse of wet
eyelashes a round cheek redder than usual and lips parted by quick
breathing relieved his mind upon that point so taking courage he sat
down on the bootjack and begged pardon like a man

Now Polly was very angry and I think she had a right to be but she
was not resentful and after the first flash was over she soon began to
feel better about it It was nt easy to forgive but as she listened
to Toms honest voice getting gruff with remorse now and then she
could nt harden her heart against him or refuse to make up when he so
frankly owned that it was confounded mean to read her book that way
She liked his coming and begging pardon at once it was a handsome thing
to do she appreciated it and forgave him in her heart some time before
she did with her lips for to tell the truth Polly had a spice of
girlish malice and rather liked to see domineering Tom eat humblepie
just enough to do him good you know She felt that atonement was
proper and considered it no more than just that Fan should drench a
handkerchief or two with repentant tears and that Tom should sit on
a very uncomfortable seat and call himself hard names for five or ten
minutes before she relented

Come now do say a word to a fellow Im getting the worst of it
anyway for theres Fan crying her eyes out upstairs and here are
you stowed away in a dark closet as dumb as a fish and nobody but me to
bring you both round Id have cut over to the Smythes and got ma home
to fix things only it looked like backing out of the scrape so I did
nt said Tom as a last appeal

Polly was glad to hear that Fan was crying It would do her good but
she could nt help softening to Tom who did seem in a predicament
between two weeping damsels A little smile began to dimple the cheek
that was nt hidden and then a hand came slowly out from under the
curly head and was stretched toward him silently Tom was just going
to give it a hearty shake when he saw a red mark on the wrist and knew
what made it His face changed and he took the chubby hand so gently
that Polly peeped to see what it meant

Will you forgive that too he asked in a whisper stroking the red
wrist

Yes it dont hurt much now And Polly drew her hand away sorry he
had seen it

I was a beast thats what I was said Tom in a tone of great
disgust And just at that awkward minute down tumbled his fathers
old beaver over his head and face putting a comical quencher on his
selfreproaches Of course neither could help laughing at that and
when he emerged Polly was sitting up looking as much better for her
shower as he did for his momentary eclipse

Fan feels dreadfully Will you kiss and be friends if I trot her
down asked Tom remembering his fellowsinner

Ill go to her And Polly whisked out of the closet as suddenly as
she had whisked in leaving Tom sitting on the bootjack with a radiant
countenance

How the girls made it up no one ever knew But after much talking and
crying kissing and laughing the breach was healed and peace declared
A slight haze still lingered in the air after the storm for Fanny
was very humble and tender that evening Tom a trifle pensive but
distressingly polite and Polly magnanimously friendly to every one for
generous natures like to forgive and Polly enjoyed the petting after
the insult like a very human girl

As she was brushing her hair at bedtime there came a tap on her door
and opening it she beheld nothing but a tall black bottle with a
strip of red flannel tied round it like a cravat and a cockedhat note
on the cork Inside were these lines written in a sprawling hand with
very black ink

DEAR POLLY Opydilldock is firstrate for sprains You put a lot on the
flannel and do up your wrist and I guess it will be all right in the
morning Will you come a sleighride tomorrow Im awful sorry I hurt
you

TOM




CHAPTER VI GRANDMA


WHERES Polly asked Fan one snowy afternoon as she came into the
diningroom where Tom was reposing on the sofa with his boots in the
air absorbed in one of those delightful books in which boys are cast
away on desert islands where every known fruit vegetable and flower
is in its prime all the year round or lost in boundless forests where
the young heroes have thrilling adventures kill impossible beasts and
when the authors invention gives out suddenly find their way home
laden with tiger skins tame buffaloes and other pleasing trophies of
their prowess

Dun no was Toms brief reply for he was just escaping from an
alligator of the largest size

Do put down that stupid book and lets do something said Fanny
after a listless stroll round the room

Hi theyve got him was the only answer vouchsafed by the absorbed
reader

Wheres Polly asked Maud joining the party with her hands full of
paper dolls all suffering for balldresses

Do get along and dont bother me cried Tom exasperated at the
interruption

Then tell us where she is Im sure you know for she was down here a
little while ago said Fanny

Up in grandmas room maybe

Provoking thing you knew it all the time and did nt tell just to
plague us scolded Maud

But Tom was now under water stabbing his alligator and took no notice
of the indignant departure of the young ladies

Pollys always poking up in grandmas room I dont see what fun there
is in it said Fanny as they went up stairs

Pollys a verwy queer girl and gwandma pets her a gweat deal more
than she does me observed Maud with an injured air

Lets peek and see what they are doing whispered Fan pausing at the
halfopen door

Grandma was sitting before a quaint old cabinet the doors of which
stood wide open showing glimpses of the faded relics treasured there
On a stool at the old ladys feet sat Polly looking up with intent
face and eager eyes quite absorbed in the history of a highheeled
brocade shoe which lay in her lap

Well my dear grandma was saying she had it on the very day that
Uncle Joe came in as she sat at work and said Dolly we must be
married at once Very well Joe says Aunt Dolly and down she went
to the parlor where the minister was waiting never stopping to change
the dimity dress she wore and was actually married with her scissors
and pinball at her side and her thimble on That was in war times
1812 my dear and Uncle Joe was in the army so he had to go and he
took that very little pinball with him Here it is with the mark of
a bullet through it for he always said his Dollys cushion saved his
life

How interesting that is cried Polly as she examined the faded
cushion with the hole in it

Why grandma you never told me that story said Fanny hurrying in
finding the prospect was a pleasant one for a stormy afternoon

You never asked me to tell you anything my dear so I kept my old
stories to myself answered grandma quietly

Tell some now please May we stay and see the funny things said Fan
and Maud eyeing the open cabinet with interest

If Polly likes she is my company and I am trying to entertain
her for I love to have her come said grandma with her oldtime
politeness

Oh yes do let them stay and hear the stories Ive often told them
what good times we have up here and teased them to come but they think
its too quiet Now sit down girls and let grandma go on You see I
pick out something in the cabinet that looks interesting and then
she tells me about it said Polly eager to include the girls in her
pleasures and glad to get them interested in grandmas reminiscences
for Polly knew how happy it made the lonely old lady to live over her
past and to have the children round her

Here are three drawers that have not been opened yet each take one
and choose something from it for me to tell about said Madam quite
excited at the unusual interest in her treasures

So the girls each opened a drawer and turned over the contents till they
found something they wanted to know about Maud was ready first and
holding up an oddly shaped linen bag with a big blue F embroidered on
it demanded her story Grandma smiled as she smoothed the old thing
tenderly and began her story with evident pleasure

My sister Nelly and I went to visit an aunt of ours when we were
little girls but we did nt have a very good time for she was
extremely strict One afternoon when she had gone out to tea and old
Debby the maid was asleep in her room we sat on the doorstep feeling
homesick and ready for any thing to amuse us

What shall we do said Nelly

Just as she spoke a ripe plum dropped bounce on the grass before us
as if answering her question It was all the plums fault for if it
had nt fallen at that minute I never should have had the thought which
popped into my mischievous mind

Lets have as many as we want and plague Aunt Betsey to pay her for
being so cross I said giving Nelly half the great purple plum

It would be dreadful naughty began Nellybut I guess we will she
added as the sweet mouthful slipped down her throat

Debbys asleep Come on then and help me shake I said getting
up eager for the fun

We shook and shook till we got red in the face but not one dropped
for the tree was large and our little arms were not strong enough
to stir the boughs Then we threw stones but only one green and one
halfripe one came down and my last stone broke the shed window so
there was an end of that

Its as provoking as Aunt Betsey herself said Nelly as we sat
down out of breath

I wish the wind would come and blowem down for us panted I
staring up at the plums with longing eyes

If wishing would do any good I should wishem in my lap at once
added Nelly

You might as well wishem in your mouth and done with it if you are
too lazy to pickem up If the ladder was nt too heavy we could try
that said I determined to have them

You know we cant stir it so what is the use of talking about it You
proposed getting the plums now lets see you do it answered Nelly
rather crossly for she had bitten the green plum and it puckered her
mouth

Wait a minute and you will see me do it cried I as a new thought
came into my naughty head

What are you taking your shoes and socks off for You cant climb the
tree Fan Dont ask questions but be ready to pickem up when they
fall Miss Lazybones With this mysterious speech I pattered into
the house barefooted and full of my plan Up stairs I went to a window
opening on the shed roof Out I got and creeping carefully along till
I came near the tree I stood up and suddenly crowed like the little
rooster Nelly looked up and stared and laughed and clapped her hands
when she saw what I was going to do

Im afraid youll slip and get hurt Dont care if I do Ill
have those plums if I break my neck doing it and half sliding half
walking I went down the sloping roof till the boughs of the tree were
within my reach

Hurrah cried Nelly dancing down below as my first shake sent a
dozen plums rattling round her

Hurrah cried I letting go one branch and trying to reach another
But as I did so my foot slipped I tried to catch something to hold by
but found nothing and with a cry down I fell like a very big plum on
the grass below

Fortunately the shed was low the grass was thick and the tree broke my
fall but I got a bad bump and a terrible shaking Nelly thought I was
killed and began to cry with her mouth full But I picked myself up in
a minute for I was used to such tumbles and did nt mind the pain half
as much as the loss of the plums

Hush Debby will hear and spoil all the fun I said Id getem and I
have See what lots have come down with me So there had for my fall
shook the tree almost as much as it did me and the green and purple
fruit lay all about us

By the time the bump on my forehead had swelled as big as a nut our
aprons were half full and we sat down to enjoy ourselves But we did
nt O dear no for many of the plums were not ripe some were hurt by
the birds some crushed in falling and many as hard as stones Nelly
got stung by a wasp my head began to ache and we sat looking at one
another rather dismally when Nelly had a bright idea

Lets cookem then theyll be good and we can put some away in
our little pails for tomorrow That will be splendid Theres a
fire in the kitchen Debby always leaves the kettle on and we can use
her saucepan and I know where the sugar is and well have a grand
time In we went and fell to work very quietly It was a large
open fireplace with the coals nicely covered up and the big kettle
simmering on the hook We raked open the fire put on the saucepan and
in it the best of our plums with water enough to spoil them But we did
nt know that and felt very important as we sat waiting for it to boil
each armed with a big spoon while the sugar box stood between us ready
to be used

How slow they were to be sure I never knew such obstinate things for
they would nt soften though they danced about in the boiling water
and bobbed against the cover as if they were doing their best

The sun began to get low we were afraid Debby would come down and
still those dreadful plums would nt look like sauce At last they began
to burst the water got a lovely purple we put lots of sugar in and
kept tasting till our aprons and faces were red and our lips burnt with
the hot spoons

Theres too much juice said Nelly shaking her head wisely It
ought to be thick and nice like mammas Ill pour off some of the
juice and we can drink it said I feeling that Id made a mistake in
my cooking

So Nelly got a bowl and I got a towel and lifted the big saucepan
carefully off It was heavy and hot and I was a little afraid of it
but did nt like to say so Just as I began to pour Debby suddenly
called from the top of the stairs Children what under the sun are you
doing It startled us both Nelly dropped the bowl and ran I dropped
the saucepan and did nt run for a part of the hot juice splashed upon
my bare feet and ankles and made me scream with dreadful pain

Down rushed Debby to find me dancing about the kitchen with a great
bump on my forehead a big spoon in my hand and a pair of bright purple
feet The plums were lying all over the hearth the saucepan in the
middle of the room the basin was broken and the sugar swimming about
as if the bowl had turned itself over trying to sweeten our mess for us

Debby was very good to me for she never stopped to scold but laid
me down on the old sofa and bound up my poor little feet with oil and
cotton wool Nelly seeing me lie white and weak thought I was dying
and went over to the neighbors for Aunt Betsey and burst in upon the
old ladies sitting primly at their tea crying distractedly Oh Aunt
Betsey come quick for the saucepan fell off the shed and Fans feet
are all boiled purple Nobody laughed at this funny message and Aunt
Betsey ran all the way home with a muffin in her hand and her ball in
her pocket though the knitting was left behind

I suffered a great deal but I was nt sorry afterward for I learned
to love Aunt Betsey who nursed me tenderly and seemed to forget her
strict ways in her anxiety for me

This bag was made for my special comfort and hung on the sofa where I
lay all those weary days Aunt kept it full of pretty patchwork or what
I liked better gingernuts and peppermint drops to amuse me though
she did nt approve of cosseting children up any more than I do now

I like that vewy well and I wish I could have been there was Mauds
condescending remark as she put back the little bag after a careful
peep inside as if she hoped to find an ancient gingernut or a
wellpreserved peppermint drop still lingering in some corner

We had plums enough that autumn but did nt seem to care much about
them after all for our prank became a household joke and for years
we never saw the fruit but Nelly would look at me with a funny face
and whisper Purple stockings Fan

Thank you maam said Polly Now Fan your turn next

Well Ive a bundle of old letters and Id like to know if there
is any story about them answered Fanny hoping some romance might be
forthcoming

Grandma turned over the little packet tied up with a faded pink ribbon
a dozen yellow notes written on rough thick paper with red wafers
still adhering to the folds showing plainly that they were written
before the day of initial notepaper and selfsealing envelopes

They are not loveletters deary but notes from my mates after I left
Miss Cottons boardingschool I dont think there is any story about
them and grandma turned them over with spectacles before the dim eyes
so young and bright when they first read the very same notes

Fanny was about to say Ill choose again when grandma began to
laugh so heartily that the girls felt sure she had caught some merry old
memory which would amuse them

Bless my heart I have nt thought of that frolic this forty years
Poor dear giddy Sally Pomroy and shes a greatgrandmother now
cried the old lady after reading one of the notes and clearing the
mist off her glasses

Now please tell about her I know its something funny to make you
laugh so said Polly and Fan together

Well it was droll and Im glad I remembered it for its just the
story to tell you young things

It was years ago began grandma briskly and teachers were very much
stricter than they are now The girls at Miss Cottons were not allowed
lights in their rooms after nine oclock never went out alone and were
expected to behave like models of propriety from morning till night

As you may imagine ten young girls full of spirits and fun found
these rules hard to keep and made up for good behavior in public by all
sorts of frolics in private

Miss Cotton and her brother sat in the back parlor after school was
over and the young ladies were sent to bed Mr John was very deaf
and Miss Priscilla very nearsighted two convenient afflictions for the
girls on some occasions but once they proved quite the reverse as you
shall hear

We had been very prim for a week and our bottled up spirits could no
longer be contained so we planed a revel after our own hearts and set
our wits to work to execute it

The first obstacle was surmounted in this way As none of us could get
out alone we resolved to lower Sally from the window for she was light
and small and very smart

With our combined pocketmoney she was to buy nuts and candy cake and
fruit pie and a candle so that we might have a light after Betsey
took ours away as usual We were to darken the window of the inner
chamber set a watch in the little entry light up and then for a good
time

At eight oclock on the appointed evening several of us professed
great weariness and went to our room leaving the rest sewing
virtuously with Miss Cotton who read Hannah Mores Sacred Dramas aloud
in a way that fitted the listeners for bed as well as a dose of opium
would have done

I am sorry to say I was one of the ringleaders and as soon as we got
up stairs produced the rope provided for the purpose and invited Sally
to be lowered It was an oldfashioned house sloping down behind and
the closet window chosen by us was not many feet from the ground

It was a summer evening so that at eight oclock it was still light
but we were not afraid of being seen for the street was a lonely one
and our only neighbors two old ladies who put down their curtains at
sunset and never looked out till morning

Sally had been bribed by promises of as manygoodies as she could
eat and being a regular madcap she was ready for anything

Tying the rope round her waist she crept out and we let her safely
down sent a big basket after her and saw her slip round the corner in
my big sun bonnet and another girls shawl so that she should not be
recognized

Then we put our nightgowns over our dresses and were laid peacefully
in bed when Betsey came up earlier than usual for it was evident that
Miss Cotton felt a little suspicious at our sudden weariness

For half an hour we lay laughing and whispering as we waited for the
signal from Sally At last we heard a cricket chirp shrilly under the
window and flying up saw a little figure below in the twilight

O quick quick cried Sally panting with haste Draw up the basket
and then get me in for I saw Mr Cotton in the market and ran all
the way home so that I might get in before he came Up came the heavy
basket bumping and scraping on the way and smelling O so nice
Down went the rope and with a long pull a strong pull and a pull all
together we hoisted poor Sally halfway up to the window when sad to
tell the rope slipped and down she fell only being saved from broken
bones by the haycock under the window

Hes coming hes coming O pull me up for mercy sake cried
Sally scrambling to her feet unhurt but a good deal shaken

We saw a dark figure approaching and dragged her in with more bumping
and scraping and embraced her with rapture for we had just escaped
being detected by Mr John whose eyes were as sharp as his ears were
dull

We heard the frontdoor shut then a murmur of voices and then
Betseys heavy step coming up stairs

Under the bed went the basket and into the beds went the conspirators
and nothing could have been more decorous than the appearance of the
room when Betsey popped her head in

Masters an old fidget to send me travelling up again just because
he fancied he saw something amiss at the window Nothing but a curtain
flapping or a shadder for the poor dears is sleeping like lambs We
heard her say this to herself and a general titter agitated the white
coverlets as she departed

Sally was in high feather at the success of her exploit and danced
about like an elf as she put her nightgown on over her frock braided
her hair in funny little tails all over her head and fastened the great
red pincushion on her bosom for a breastpin in honor of the feast

The other girls went to their rooms as agreed upon and all was soon
dark and still up stairs while Miss Cotton began to enjoy herself
below as she always did whenher young charges were safely disposed
of

Then ghosts began to walk and the mice scuttled back to their holes
in alarm for white figures glided from room to room till all were
assembled in the little chamber

The watch was set at the entry door the signal agreed upon the candle
lighted and the feast spread forth upon a newspaper on the bed with
the coverlet arranged so that it could be whisked over the refreshments
at a moments notice

How good everything was to be sure I dont think Ive eaten any
pies since that had such a delicious flavor as those broken ones eaten
hastily in that little oven of a room with Sally making jokes and the
others enjoying stolen sweets with true girlish relish Of course it was
very wicked but I must tell the truth

We were just beginning on the cake when the loud scratching of a rat
disturbed us

The signal fly run hide Hush dont laugh cried several voices
and we scuttled into bed as rapidly and noiselessly as possible with
our mouths and hands full

A long pause broken by more scratching but as no one came we decided
on sending to inquire what it meant I went and found Mary the picket
guard half asleep and longing for her share of the feast

It was a real rat Ive not made a sound Do go and finish Im
tired of this said Mary slapping away at the mosquitoes

Back I hurried with the good news Every one flew up briskly We
lighted the candle again and returned to our revel The refreshments
were somewhat injured by Sallys bouncing in among them bit we did nt
care and soon finished the cake

Now lets have the nuts I said groping for the paper bag

They are almonds and peanuts so we can crack them with our teeth Be
sure you get the bag by the right end said Sally

I know what Im about and to show her that it was all right I
gave the bag a little shake when out flew the nuts rattling like a
hailstorm all over the uncarpeted floor

Now youve done it cried Sally as Mary scratched like a mad rat
and a door creaked below for Miss Cotton was not deaf

Such a flurry as we were in Out went the candle and each one rushed
away with as much of the feast as she could seize in her haste Sally
dived into her bed recklessly demolishing the last pie and scattering
the candy far and wide

Poor Mary was nearly caught for Miss Cotton was quicker than Betsey
and our guard had to run for her life

Our room was the first and was in good order though the two flushed
faces on the pillows were rather suspicious Miss Cotton stood staring
about her looking so funny without her cap that my bedfellow would
have gone off in a fit of laughter if I had not pinched her warningly

Young ladies what is this unseemly noise No answer from us but
a faint snore Miss Cotton marched into the next room put the same
question and received the same reply

In the third chamber lay Sally and we trembled as the old lady went
in Sitting up we peeped and listened breathlessly

Sarah I command you to tell me what this all means But Sally only
sighed in her sleep and muttered wickedly Ma take me home Im
starved at Cottons Mercy on me is the child going to have a fever
cried the old lady who did not observe the tell tale nuts at her feet

So dull so strict O take me home moaned Sally tossing her arms
and gurgling like a naughty little gypsy

That last bit of acting upset the whole concern for as she tossed her
arms she showed the big red cushion on her breast Nearsighted as she
was that ridiculous object could not escape Miss Cotton neither did
the orange that rolled out from the pillow nor the boots appearing at
the foot of the bed

With sudden energy the old lady plucked off the cover and there lay
Sally with her hair dressed la Topsy her absurd breastpin and her
dusty boots among papers of candy bits of pie and cake oranges and
apples and a candle upside down burning a hole in the sheet

At the sound of Miss Cottons horrified exclamation Sally woke up and
began laughing so merrily that none of us could resist following her
example and the rooms rang with merriment far many minutes I really
dont know when we should have stopped if Sally had not got choked with
the nut she had in her mouth and so frightened us nearly out of our
wits

What became of the things and how were you punished asked Fan in
the middle of her laughter

The remains of the feast went to the pig and we were kept on bread and
water for three days

Did that cure you

Oh dear no we had half a dozen other frolics that very summer and
although I cannot help laughing at the remembrance of this you must not
think child that I approve of such conduct or excuse it No no my
dear far from it

I call that a tiptop story Drive on grandma and tell one about
boys broke in a new voice and there was Tom astride of a chair
listening and laughing with all his might for his book had come to an
end and he had joined the party unobserved

Wait for your turn Tommy Now Polly dear what will you have
said grandma looking so lively and happy that it was very evident
reminiscing did her good

Let mine come last and tell one for Tom next said Polly looking
round and beckoning him nearer

He came and sat himself crosslegged on the floor before the lower
drawer of the cabinet which grandma opened for him saying with a
benign stroke of the curly head There dear thats where I keep the
little memorials of my brother Jack Poor lad he was lost at sea you
know Well choose anything you like and Ill try to remember a story
about it

Tom made a rapid rummage and fished up a little broken pistol

There thats the chap for me Wish it was nt spoilt then wed have
fun popping away at the cats in the yard Now then grandma

I remember one of Jacks pranks when that was used with great effect
said grandma after a thoughtful pause during which Tom teased the
girls by snapping the lock of the pistol in their faces

Once upon a time continued Madam much flattered by the row of
interested faces before her my father went away on business leaving
mother aunt and us girls to Jacks care Very proud he was to be
sure of the responsibility and the first thing he did was to load that
pistol and keep it by his bed in our great worriment for we feared he
d kill himself with it For a week all went well then we were startled
by the news that robbers were about All sorts of stories flew through
the town we were living in the country then some said that certain
houses were marked with a black cross and those were always robbed
others that there was a boy in the gang for windows so small that
they were considered safe were entered by some little rogue At one
place the thieves had a supper and left ham and cake in the front yard
Mrs Jones found Mrs Smiths shawl in her orchard with a hammer and
an unknown teapot near it One man reported that some one tapped at
his window in the night saying softly Is anyone here and when he
looked out two men were seen to run down the road

We lived just out of town in a lonely place the house was old with
convenient little back windows and five outside doors Jack was the
only man about the place and he was barely thirteen Mother and aunt
were very timid and the children werent old enough to be of any
use so Jack and I were the homeguard and vowed to defend the family
manfully

Good for you Hope the fellows came cried Tom charmed with this
opening

One day an illlooking man came in and asked for food continued
grandma with a mysterious nod and while he ate I saw him glance
sharply about from the wooden buttons on the backdoors to the silver
urn and tankards on the diningroom sideboard A strong suspicion took
possession of me and I watched him as a cat does a mouse

He came to examine the premises Im sure of it but we will be ready
for him I said fiercely as I told the family about him

This fancy haunted us all and our preparations were very funny Mother
borrowed a rattle and kept it under her pillow Aunt took a big bell
to bed with her the children had little Tip the terrier to sleep in
their room while Jack and I mounted guard he with the pistol and I
with a hatchet for I did nt like firearms Biddy who slept in the
attic practised getting out on the shed roof so that she might run
away at the first alarm Every night we arranged pitfalls for the
robbers and all filed up to bed bearing plate money weapons and
things to barricade with as if we lived in war times

We waited a week and no one came so we began to feel rather slighted
for other people gota scare as Tom says and after all our
preparations we really felt a trifle disappointed that we had had no
chance to show our courage At last a black mark was found upon our
door and a great panic ensued for we felt that now our time had come

That night we put a tub of water at the bottom of the backstairs and
a pile of tin pans at the top of the front stairs so that any attempt
to come up would produce a splash or a rattle Bells were hung on door
handles sticks of wood piled up in dark corners for robbers to fall
over and the family retired all armed and all provided with lamps and
matches

Jack and I left our doors open and kept asking one another if we did
nt hear something till he fell asleep I was wakeful and lay listening
to the crickets till the clock struck twelve then I got drowsy and
was just dropping off when the sound of steps outside woke me up staring
wide awake Creeping to the window I was in time to see by the dim
moonlight a shadow glide round the corner and disappear A queer little
thrill went over me but I resolved to keep quiet till I was sure
something was wrong for I had given so many false alarms I did nt
want Jack to laugh at me again Popping my head out of the door I
listened and presently heard a scraping sound near the shed

There they are but I wont rouse the house till the bell rings or the
pans fall The rogues cant go far without a clatter of some sort and
if we could only catch one of them we should get the reward and a deal
of glory I said to myself grasping my hatchet firmly

A door closed softly below and a step came creeping towards the
backstairs Sure now of my prey I was just about to scream Jack
when something went splash into the tub at the foot of the backstairs

In a minute every one was awake and up for Jack fired his pistol
before he was half out of bed and roared Fire so loud it roused the
house Mother sprung her rattle aunt rang her bell Jip barked like
mad and we all screamed while from below came up a regular Irish howl

Some one brought a lamp and we peeped anxiously down to see our own
stupid Biddy sitting in the tub wringing her hands and wailing dismally

Och murther and its kilt I am The saints be about us how iver
did I come forninst this say iv wather just crapin in quiet afther
a bit iv sthroll wid Mike Mahoney me own by thats to marry me
intirely come Saint Patricks day nixt We laughed so we could hardly
fish the poor thing up or listen while she explained that she had
slipped out of her window for a word with Mike and found it fastened
when she wanted to come back so she had sat on the roof trying to
discover the cause of this mysterious barring out till she was
tired when she prowled round the house till she found a cellar window
unfastened after all our care and got in quite cleverly she thought
but the tub was a new arrangement which she knew nothing about and when
she fell into thesay she was bewildered and could only howl

This was not all the damage either for aunt fainted with the fright
mother cut her hand with a broken lamp the children took cold hopping
about on the wet stairs Jip barked himself sick I sprained my ankle
and Jack not only smashed a lookingglass with his bullets but spoilt
his pistol by the heavy charge put in it After the damages were
repaired and the flurry was well over Jack confessed that he had marked
the door for fun and shut Biddy out as a punishment forgallivanting
of which he did nt approve Such a rogue as that boy was

But did nt the robbers ever come cried Tom enjoying the joke but
feeling defrauded of the fight

Never my dear but we had ourscare and tested our courage and
that was a great satisfaction of course answered grandma placidly

Well I think you were the bravest of the lot Id like to have seen
you flourishing round there with your hatchet added Tom admiringly
and the old lady looked as much pleased with the compliment as if she
had been a girl

I choose this said Polly holding up a long white kid glove shrunken
and yellow with time but looking as if it had a history

Ah that now has a story worth telling cried grandma adding
proudly Treat that old glove respectfully my children for
Lafayettes honored hand has touched it

Oh grandma did you wear it Did you see him Do tell us all about it
and that will be the best of the whole cried Polly who loved history
and knew a good deal about the gallant Frenchman and his brave life

Grandma loved to tell this story and always assumed her most imposing
air to do honor to her theme Drawing herself up therefore she folded
her hands and after two or three little hems began with an absent
look as if her eyes beheld a faraway time which brightened as she
gazed

The first visit of Lafayette was before my time of course but I heard
so much about it from my grandfather that I really felt as if Id seen
it all Our Aunt Hancock lived in the Governors house on Beacon Hill
at that time Here the old lady bridled up still more for she was very
proud of our aunt Ah my dears those were the good old times she
continued with a sigh Such dinners and tea parties such damask
table cloths and fine plate such solid handsome furniture and elegant
carriages aunts was lined with red silk velvet and when the coach
was taken away from her at the Governors death she just ripped out
the lining and we girls had spencers made of it Dear heart how well
I remember playing in aunts great garden and chasing Jack up and down
those winding stairs and my blessed father in his plumcolored coat
and knee buckles and the queue I used to tie up for him every day
handing aunt in to dinner looking so dignified and splendid

Grandma seemed to forget her story for a minute and become a little
girl again among the playmates dead and gone so many years Polly
motioned the others to be quiet and no one spoke till the old lady
with a long sigh came back to the present and went on

Well as I was saying the Governor wanted to give a breakfast to the
French officers and Madam who was a hospitable soul got up a splendid
one for them But by some mistake or accident it was discovered at the
last minute that there was no milk

A great deal was needed and very little could be bought or borrowed
so despair fell upon the cooks and maids and the great breakfast would
have been a failure if Madam with the presence of mind of her sex had
not suddenly bethought herself of the cows feeding on the Common

To be sure they belonged to her neighbors and there was no time to
ask leave but it was a national affair our allies must be fed and
feeling sure that her patriotic friends would gladly lay their cows on
the altar of their country Madam Hancock covered herself with glory
by calmly issuing the command Milkem It was done to the great
astonishment of the cows and the entire satisfaction of the guests
among whom was Lafayette

This milking feat was such a good joke that no one seems to have
remembered much about the great man though one of his officers a
count signalized himself by getting very tipsy and going to bed with
his boots and spurs on which caused the destruction of aunts best
yellow damask coverlet for the restless sleeper kicked it into rags by
morning

Aunt valued it very much even in its tattered condition and kept it a
long while as a memorial of her distinguished guests

The time when I saw Lafayette was in 1825 and there were no tipsy
counts then Uncle Hancock a sweet man my dears though some call him
mean nowadays was dead and aunt had married Captain Scott

It was not at all the thing for her to do however thats neither
here nor there She was living in Federal Street at the time a most
aristocratic street then children and we lived close by

Old Josiah Quincy was mayor of the city and he sent aunt word that the
Marquis Lafayette wished to pay his respects to her

Of course she was delighted and we all flew about to make ready for
him Aunt was an old lady but she made a grand toilet and was as
anxious to look well as any girl

What did she wear asked Fan with interest

She wore a steelcolored satin trimmed with black lace and on her cap
was pinned a Lafayette badge of white satin

I never shall forget how beautifully she looked as she sat in state
on the front parlor sophy right under a great portrait of her first
husband and on either side of her sat Madam Storer and Madam Williams
elegant to behold in their stiff silks rich lace and stately turbans
We dont see such splendid old ladies nowadays

I think we do sometimes said Polly slyly

Grandma shook her head but it pleased her very much to be admired for
she had been a beauty in her day

We girls had dressed the house with flowers old Mr Coolidge sent in a
clothesbasket full Joe Joy provided the badges and aunt got out some
of the Revolutionary wine from the old Beacon Street cellar

I wore my green and white palmyrine my hair bowed high the beautiful
legomutton sleeves that were so becoming and these very gloves

Well byandby the General escorted by the Mayor drove up Dear me
I see him now a little old man in nankeen trousers and vest a long
blue coat and ruffled shirt leaning on his cane for he was lame and
smiling and bowing like a true Frenchman

As he approached the three old ladies rose and courtesied with the
utmost dignity Lafayette bowed first to the Governors picture then to
the Governors widow and kissed her hand

That was droll for on the back of her glove was stamped Lafayettes
likeness and the gallant old gentleman kissed his own face

Then some of the young ladies were presented and as if to escape any
further selfsalutations the marquis kissed the pretty girls on the
cheek

Yes my dears here is just the spot where the dear old man saluted me
Im quite as proud of it now as I was then for he was a brave good
man and helped us in our trouble

He did not stay long but we were very merry drinking his health
receiving his compliments and enjoying the honor he did us

Down in the street there was a crowd of course and when he left they
wanted to take out the horses and drag him home in triumph But he did
nt wish it and while that affair was being arranged we girls had been
pelting him with the flowers which we tore from the vases the walls
and our own topknots to scatter over him

He liked that and laughed and waved his hand to us while we ran and
pelted and begged him to come again

We young folks quite lost our heads that night and I have nt a very
clear idea of how I got home The last thing I remember was hanging out
of the window with a flock of girls watching the carriage roll away
while the crowd cheered as if they were mad

Bless my heart it seems as if I heardem now Hurrah for Lafayette
and Mayor Quincy Hurrah for Madam Hancock and the pretty girls Hurrah
for Col May Three cheers for Boston Now then Hurrah Hurrah
Hurrah

And here the old lady stopped out of breath with her cap askew her
spectacles on the end of her nose and her knitting much the worse for
being waved enthusiastically in the air while she hung over the arm of
her chair shrilly cheering an imaginary Lafayette The girls clapped
their hands and Tom hurrahed with all his might saying when he got
his breath Lafayette was a regular old trump I always liked him

My dear what a disrespectful way to speak of that great man said
grandma shocked at Young Americas irreverence

Well he was a trump anyway so why not call him one asked Tom
feeling that the objectionable word was all that could be desired

What queer gloves you wore then interrupted Fanny who had been
trying on the muchhonored glove and finding it a tight fit

Much better and cheaper than we have now returned grandma ready
to defend the good old times against every insinuation You are an
extravagant set nowadays and I really dont know what you are coming
to By the way Ive got somewhere two letters written by two young
ladies one in 1517 and the other in 1868 The contrast between the two
will amuse you I think

After a little search grandma produced an old portfolio and selecting
the papers read the following letter written by Anne Boleyn before
her marriage to Henry VIII and now in the possession of a celebrated
antiquarian

DEAR MARY I have been in town almost a month yet I cannot say I have
found anything in London extremely agreeable We rise so late in the
morning seldom before six oclock and sit up so late at night being
scarcely in bed before ten that I am quite sick of it and was it not
for the abundance of fine things I am every day getting I should be
impatient of returning into the country

My indulgent mother bought me yesterday at a merchants in Cheapside
three new shifts that cost fourteen pence an ell and I am to have a
pair of new stuff shoes for my Lord of Norfolks ball which will be
three shillings

The irregular life I have led since my coming to this place has quite
destroyed my appetite You know I could manage a pound of bacon and a
tankard of good ale for my breakfast in the country but in London I
find it difficult to get through half the quantity though I must own
I am generally eager enough for the dinner hour which is here delayed
till twelve in your polite society

I played at hot cockles last night at my Lord of Leicesters The Lord
of Surrey was there a very elegant young man who sung a song of
his own composition on the Lord of Kildares Daughter It was much
approved and my brother whispered me that the fair Geraldine for so my
Lord of Surrey calls his sweetheart is the finest woman of the age I
should be glad to see her for I hear she is good as she is beautiful

Pray take care of the poultry during my absence Poor things I always
fed them myself and if Margery has knitted me the crimson worsted
mittens I should be glad if they were sent up the first opportunity

Adieu dear Mary I am just going to mass and you shall speedily have
the prayers as you have now the kindest love of your own ANNE BOLEYN

Up before six and think it late to go to bed at ten What a
countrified thing Anne must have been Bacon and ale for breakfast and
dinner at twelve how very queer to live so cried Fanny Lord Surrey
and Lord Leicester sound fine but hot cockles and red mittens and
shoes for three shillings are horrid

I like it said Polly thoughtfully and Im glad poor Anne had a
little fun before her troubles began May I copy that letter some time
grandma

Yes dear and welcome Now heres the other by a modern girl on her
first visit to London This will suit you better Fan and grandma
read what a friend had sent her as a pendant to Annes little picture of
London life long ago

MY DEAREST CONSTANCE After three months of intense excitement I snatch
a leisure moment to tell you how much I enjoy my first visit to London
Having been educated abroad it really seems like coming to a strange
city At first the smoke dirt and noise were very disagreeable but
I soon got used to these things and now find all I see perfectly
charming

We plunged at once into a whirl of gayety and I have had no time to
think of anything but pleasure It is the height of the season and
every hour is engaged either in going to balls concerts theatres
fetes and church or in preparing for them We often go to two or three
parties in an evening and seldom get home till morning so of course
we dont rise till noon next day This leaves very little time for our
drives shopping and calls before dinner at eight and then the evening
gayeties begin again

At a ball at Lady Russells last night I saw the Prince of Wales and
danced in the set with him He is growing stout and looks dissipated I
was disappointed in him for neither in appearance nor conversation was
he at all princely I was introduced to a very brilliant and delightful
young gentleman from America I was charmed with him and rather
surprised to learn that he wrote the poems which were so much admired
last season also that he is the son of a rich tailor How odd these
Americans are with their money and talent and independence

O my dear I must not forget to tell you the great event of my first
season I am to be presented at the next Drawing Room Think how
absorbed I must be in preparation for this grand affair Mamma is
resolved that I shall do her credit and we have spent the last two
weeks driving about from milliners to mantuamakers from merchants to
jewellers I am to wear white satin and plumes pearls and roses My
dress will cost a hundred pounds or more and is very elegant

My cousins and friends lavish lovely things upon me and you will open
your unsophisticated eyes when I display my silks and laces trinkets
and French hats not to mention billet deux photographs and other
relics of a young belles first season

You ask if I ever think of home I really have nt time but I do
sometimes long a little for the quiet the pure air and the girlish
amusements I used to enjoy so much One gets pale and old and sadly
fagged out with all this dissipation pleasant as it is I feel quite
blase already

If you could send me the rosy cheeks bright eyes and gay spirits I
always had at home Id thank you As you cannot do that please send
me a bottle of June rain water for my maid tells me it is better than
any cosmetic for the complexion and mine is getting ruined by late
hours

I fancy some fruit off our own trees would suit me for I have no
appetite and mamma is quite desolate about me One cannot live on
French cookery without dyspepsia and one can get nothing simple here
for food like everything else is regulated by the fashion

Adieu ma chere I must dress for church I only wish you could see my
new hat and go with me for Lord Rockingham promised to be there

Adieu yours eternally FLORENCE

Yes I do like that better and I wish I had been in this girls place
dont you Polly said Fan as grandma took off her glasses

I should love to go to London and have a good time but I dont think
I should care about spending ever so much money or going to Court
Maybe I might when I got there for I do like fun and splendor added
honest Polly feeling that pleasure was a very tempting thing

Grandma looks tired lets go and play in the dwyingwoom said Maud
who found the conversation getting beyond her depth

Let us all kiss and thank grandma for amusing us so nicely before
we go whispered Polly Maud and Fanny agreed and grandma looked so
gratified by their thanks that Tom followed suit merely waiting till
those girls were out of sight to give the old lady a hearty hug and
a kiss on the very cheek Lafayette had saluted

When he reached the playroom Polly was sitting in the swing saying
very earnestly I always told you it was nice up in grandmas room and
now you see it is I wish youd go oftener she admires to have you
and likes to tell stories and do pleasant things only she thinks you
dont care for her quiet sort of fun I do anyway and I think shes
the kindest best old lady that ever lived and I love her dearly

I did nt say she was nt only old people are sort of tedious and
fussy so I keep out of their way said Fanny

Well you ought not to and you miss lots of pleasant times My mother
says we ought to be kind and patient and respectful to all old folks
just because they are old and I always mean to be

Your mothers everlastingly preaching muttered Fan nettled by the
consciousness of her own shortcomings with regard to grandma

She dont preach cried Polly firing up like a flash she only
explains things to us and helps us be good and never scolds and I
d rather have her than any other mother in the world though she dont
wear velvet cloaks and splendid bonnets so now

Go it Polly called Tom who was gracefully hanging head downward
from the bar put up for his special benefit

Pollys mad Pollys mad sung Maud skipping rope round the room

If Mr Sydney could see you now he would nt think you such an angel
any more added Fanny tossing a beanbag and her head at the same
time

Polly was mad her face was very red her eyes very bright and her lips
twitched but she held her tongue and began to swing as hard as she
could fearing to say something she would be sorry for afterward For a
few minutes no one spoke Tom whistled and Maud hummed but Fan and Polly
were each soberly thinking of something for they had reached an
age when children girls especially begin to observe contrast and
speculate upon the words acts manners and looks of those about them
A good deal of thinking goes on in the heads of these shrewd little
folks and the elders should mind their ways for they get criticised
pretty sharply and imitated very closely

Two little things had happened that day and the influence of a few
words a careless action was still working in the active minds of the
girls

Mr Sydney had called and while Fanny was talking with him she saw his
eye rest on Polly who sat apart watching the faces round her with the
modest intelligent look which many found so attractive At that minute
Madam Shaw came in and stopped to speak to the little girl Polly rose
at once and remained standing till the old lady passed on

Are you laughing at Pollys prim ways Fanny had asked as she saw Mr
Sydney smile

No I am admiring Miss Pollys fine manners he answered in a grave
respectful tone which had impressed Fanny very much for Mr Sydney
was considered by all the girls as a model of good breeding and that
indescribable something which they called elegance

Fanny wished she had done that little thing and won that approving
look for she valued the young mans good opinion because it was
so hard to win by her set at least So when Polly talked about old
people it recalled this scene and made Fan cross

Polly was remembering how when Mrs Shaw came home that day in her fine
visiting costume and Maud ran to welcome her with unusual affection
she gathered up her lustrous silk and pushed the little girl away
saying impatiently Dont touch me child your hands are dirty
Then the thought had come to Polly that the velvet cloak did nt cover
a right motherly heart that the fretful face under the nodding purple
plumes was not a tender motherly face and that the hands in the
delicate primrose gloves had put away something very sweet and precious
She thought of another woman whose dress never was too fine for little
wet cheeks to lie against or loving little arms to press whose face
in spite of many lines and the gray hairs above it was never sour or
unsympathetic when childrens eyes turned towards it and whose hands
never were too busy too full or too nice to welcome and serve the
little sons and daughters who freely brought their small hopes and
fears sins and sorrows to her who dealt out justice and mercy with
such wise love Ah thats a mother thought Polly as the memory
came warm into her heart making her feel very rich and pity Maud for
being so poor

This it was that caused such sudden indignation at Fannys dreadful
speech and this it was that made quicktempered Polly try to calm her
wrath before she used toward Fannys mother the disrespectful tone she
so resented toward her own As the swing came down after some dozen
quick journeys to and fro Polly seemed to have found a smile somewhere
up aloft for she looked toward Fan saying pleasantly as she paused
a little in her airy exercise Im not mad now shall I come and toss
with you

No Ill come and swing with you answered Fanny quick to feel the
generous spirit of her friend

You are an angel and Ill never be so rude again she added as
Pollys arm came round her and half the seat was gladly offered

No I aint but if I ever get at all like one it will bemothers
preaching that did it said Polly with a happy laugh

Good for you Polly Peacemaker cried Tom quoting his father and
giving them a grand push as the most appropriate way of expressing his
approbation of the sentiment

Nothing more was said but from that day there slowly crept into the
family more respect for grandma more forbearance with her infirmities
more interest in her little stories and many a pleasant gossip did the
dear old lady enjoy with the children as they gathered round her fire
solitary so long




CHAPTER VII GOODBY


OH dear Must you really go home Saturday said Fan some days after
what Tom called the grand scrimmage

I really must for I only came to stay a month and here Ive been
nearly six weeks answered Polly feeling as if she had been absent a
year

Make it two months and stay over Christmas Come do now urged Tom
heartily

You are very kind but I would nt miss Christmas at home for anything
Besides mother says they cant possibly do without me

Neither can we Cant you tease your mother and make up your mind to
stay began Fan

Polly never teases She says its selfish and I dont do it now
much put in Maud with a virtuous air

Dont you bother Polly Shed rather go and I dont wonder Lets be
just as jolly as we can while she stays and finish up with your party
Fan said Tom in a tone that settled the matter

Polly had expected to be very happy in getting ready for the party but
when the time came she was disappointed for somehow that naughty thing
called envy took possession of her and spoiled her pleasure Before she
left home she thought her new white muslin dress with its fresh blue
ribbons the most elegant and proper costume she could have but
now when she saw Fannys pink silk with a white tarlatan tunic and
innumerable puffings bows and streamers her own simple little
toilet lost all its charms in her eyes and looked very babyish and
oldfashioned

Even Maud was much better dressed than herself and looked very splendid
in her cherrycolored and white suit with a sash so big she could
hardly carry it and little white boots with red buttons They both
had necklaces and bracelets earrings and brooches but Polly had no
ornament except the plain locket on a bit of blue velvet Her sash was
only a wide ribbon tied in a simple bow and nothing but a blue snood
in the pretty curls Her only comfort was the knowledge that the modest
tucker drawn up round the plump shoulders was real lace and that her
bronze boots cost nine dollars

Poor Polly with all her efforts to be contented and not to mind
looking unlike other people found it hard work to keep her face bright
and her voice happy that night No one dreamed what was going an under
the muslin frock till grandmas wise old eyes spied out the little
shadow on Pollys spirits and guessed the cause of it When dressed
the three girls went up to show themselves to the elders who were in
grandmas room where Tom was being helped into an agonizingly stiff
collar

Maud pranced like a small peacock and Fan made a splendid courtesy as
every one turned to survey them but Polly stood still and her eyes
went from face to face with an anxious wistful air which seemed to
say I know Im not right but I hope I dont look very bad

Grandma read the look in a minute and when Fanny said with a satisfied
smile How do we look she answered drawing Polly toward her so
kindly

Very like the fashionplates you got the patterns of your dresses from
But this little costume suits me best

Do you really think I look nice and Pollys face brightened for she
valued the old ladys opinion very much

Yes my dear you look just as I like to see a child of your age look
What particularly pleases me is that you have kept your promise to your
mother and have nt let anyone persuade you to wear borrowed finery
Young things like you dont need any ornaments but those you wear
tonight youth health intelligence and modesty

As she spoke grandma gave a tender kiss that made Polly glow like a
rose and for a minute she forgot that there were such things as pink
silk and coral earrings in the world She only said Thank you
maam and heartily returned the kiss but the words did her good and
her plain dress looked charming all of a sudden

Pollys so pretty it dont matter what she wears observed Tom
surveying her over his collar with an air of calm approval

She has nt got any bwetelles to her dwess and I have said Maud
settling her ruffled bands over her shoulders which looked like
cherrycolored wings on a stout little cherub

I did wish shed just wear my blue set ribbon is so very plain but
as Tom says it dont much matter and Fanny gave an effective touch to
the blue bow above Pollys left temple

She might wear flowers they always suit young girls said Mrs Shaw
privately thinking that her own daughters looked much the best yet
conscious that blooming Polly had the most attractive face Bless me
I forgot my posies in admiring the belles Hand them out Tom and Mr
Shaw nodded toward an interesting looking box that stood on the table

Seizing them wrong sideup Tom produced three little bouquets all
different in color size and construction

Why papa how very kind of you cried Fanny who had not dared to
receive even a geranium leaf since the late scrape

Your father used to be a very gallant young gentleman once upon a
time said Mrs Shaw with a simper

Ah Tom its a good sign when you find time to think of giving
pleasure to your little girls And grandma patted her sons bald head
as if he was nt more than eighteen

Thomas Jr had given a somewhat scornful sniff at first but when
grandma praised his father the young man thought better of the matter
and regarded the flowers with more respect as he asked Which is for
which

Guess said Mr Shaw pleased that his unusual demonstration had
produced such an effect

The largest was a regular hothouse bouquet of tearosebuds scentless
heath and smilax the second was just a handful of sweetpeas and
mignonette with a few cheerful pansies and one fragrant little rose in
the middle the third a small posy of scarlet verbenas white feverfew
and green leaves

Not hard to guess The smart one for Fan the sweet one for Polly and
the gay one for Pug Now then catch hold girls And Tom proceeded
to deliver the nosegays with as much grace as could be expected from a
youth in a new suit of clothes and very tight boots

That finishes you off just right and is a very pretty attention of
papas Now run down for the bell has rung and remember not to dance
too often Fan be as quiet as you can Tom and Maud dont eat too
much supper Grandma will attend to things for my poor nerves wont
allow me to come down

With that Mrs Shaw dismissed them and the four descended to receive
the first batch of visitors several little girls who had been asked
for the express purpose of keeping Maud out of her sisters way Tom
had likewise been propitiated by being allowed to bring his three bosom
friends who went by the schoolboy names of Rumple Sherry and Spider

They will do to make up sets as gentlemen are scarce and the party is
for Polly so I must have some young folks on her account said Fanny
when sending out her invitations

Of course the boys came early and stood about in corners looking as
if they had more arms and legs than they knew what to do with Tom did
his best to be a good host but ceremony oppressed his spirits and he
was forced to struggle manfully with the wild desire to propose a game
of leapfrog for the long drawingrooms cleared for dancing tempted
him sorely

Polly sat where she was told and suffered bashful agonies as Fan
introduced very fine young ladies and very stiff young gentlemen who
all said about the same civil things and then appeared to forget all
about her When the first dance was called Fanny cornered Tom who had
been dodging her for he knew what she wanted and said in an earnest
whisper Now Tom you must dance this with Polly You are the young
gentleman of the house and its only proper that you should ask your
company first

Polly dont care for manners I hate dancing dont know how Let go
my jacket and dont bother or Ill cut away altogether growled Tom
daunted by the awful prospect of opening the ball with Polly

Ill never forgive you if you do Come be clever and help me there
s a dear You know we both were dreadfully rude to Polly and agreed
that wed be as kind and civil to her as ever we could I shall keep
my word and see that she is nt slighted at my party for I want her to
love me and go home feeling all right

This artful speech made an impression on the rebellious Thomas who
glanced at Pollys happy face remembered his promise and with a
groan resolved to do his duty

Well Ill take her but I shall come to grief for I dont know
anything about your old dances

Yes you do Ive taught you the steps a dozen times Im going to
begin with a redowa because the girls like it and its better fun
than square dances Now put on your gloves and go and ask Polly like a
gentleman

Oh thunder muttered Tom And having split the detested gloves in
dragging them on he nerved himself for the effort walked up to Polly
made a stiff bow stuck out his elbow and said solemnly May I have
the pleasure Miss Milton

He did it as much like the big fellows as he could and expected that
Polly would be impressed But she was nt a bit for after a surprised
look she laughed in his face and took him by the hand saying
heartily Of course you may but dont be a goose Tommy

Well Fan told me to be elegant so I tried to whispered Tom adding
as he clutched his partner with a somewhat desperate air Hold on
tight and well get through somehow

The music struck up and away they went Tom hopping one way and Polly
the other in a most ungraceful manner

Keep time to the music gasped Polly

Cant never could returned Tom

Keep step with me then and dont tread on my toes pleaded Polly

Never mind keep bobbing and well come right by and by muttered
Tom giving his unfortunate partner a sudden whisk which nearly landed
both on the floor

But they did not get right by and by for Tom In his frantic efforts
to do his duty nearly annihilated poor Polly He tramped he bobbed he
skated he twirled her to the right dragged her to the left backed her
up against people and furniture trod on her feet rumpled her dress
and made a spectacle of himself generally Polly was much disturbed
but as everyone else was flying about also she bore it as long as
she could knowing that Tom had made a martyr of himself and feeling
grateful to him for the sacrifice

Oh do stop now this is dreadful cried Polly breathlessly after a
few wild turns

Is nt it said Tom wiping his red face with such an air of intense
relief that Polly had not the heart to scold him but said Thank
you and dropped into a chair exhausted

I know Ive made a guy of myself but Fan insisted on it for fear
youd be offended if I did nt go the first dance with you said Tom
remorsefully watching Polly as she settled the bow of her crushed sash
which Tom had used as a sort of handle by which to turn and twist her
I can do the Lancers tiptop but you wont ever want to dance with me
any more he added as he began to fan her so violently that her hair
flew about as if in a gale of wind

Yes I will Id like to and you shall put your name down here on
the sticks of my fan Thats the way Trix says when you dont have a
ballbook

Looking much gratified Tom produced the stump of a leadpencil and
wrote his name with a flourish saying as he gave it back Now Im
going to get Sherry or some of the fellows that do the redowa well so
you can have a real good go before the music stops

Off went Tom but before he could catch any eligible partner Polly was
provided with the best dancer in the room Mr Sydney had seen and heard
the whole thing and though he had laughed quietly he liked honest Tom
and goodnatured Polly all the better for their simplicity Pollys foot
was keeping time to the lively music and her eyes were fixed wistfully
on the smoothlygliding couples before her when Mr Sydney came to
her saying in the pleasant yet respectful way she liked so much Miss
Polly can you give me a turn

Oh yes Im dying for another And Polly jumped up with both hands
out and such a grateful face that Mr Sydney resolved she should have
as many turns as she liked

This time all went well and Tom returning from an unsuccessful search
was amazed to behold Polly circling gracefully about the room guided by
a most accomplished partner

Ah thats something like he thought as he watched the bronze boots
retreating and advancing in perfect time to the music Dont see how
Sydney does the steering so well but it must be fun and by Jupiter I
ll learn it added Shaw Jr with an emphatic gesture which burst the
last button off his gloves

Polly enjoyed herself till the music stopped and before she had time to
thank Mr Sydney as warmly as she wished Tom came up to say with his
most lordly air You dance splendidly Polly Now you just show me any
one you like the looks of and Ill get him for you no matter who he
is

I dont want any of the gentlemen they are so stiff and dont care
to dance with me but I like those boys over there and Ill dance with
any of them if they are willing said Polly after a survey

Ill trot out the whole lot And Tom gladly brought up his friends
who all admired Polly immensely and were proud to be chosen instead of
the big fellows

There was no sitting still for Polly after that for the lads kept her
going at a great pace and she was so happy she never saw or suspected
how many little manoeuvres heartburnings displays of vanity
affectation and nonsense were going on all round her She loved
dancing and entered into the gayety of the scene with a heartiness that
was pleasant to see Her eyes shone her face glowed her lips smiled
and the brown curls waved in the air as she danced with a heart as
light as her feet

Are you enjoying yourself Polly asked Mr Shaw who looked in now
and then to report to grandma that all was going well

Oh such a splendid time cried Polly with an enthusiastic little
gesture as she chassed into the corner where he stood

She is a regular belle among the boys said Fanny as she promenaded
by

They are so kind in asking me and Im not afraid of them explained
Polly prancing simply because she could nt keep still

So you are afraid of the young gentlemen hey and Mr Shaw held her
by one curl

All but Mr Sydney He dont put on airs and talk nonsense and oh he
doesdance like an angel as Trix says

Papa I wish youd come and waltz with me Fan told me not to go near
hercause my wed dwess makes her pink one look ugly and Tom wont
and I want to dwedfully

Ive forgotten how Maudie Ask Polly shell spin you round like a
teetotum Mr Sydneys name is down for that answered Polly looking
at her fan with a pretty little air of importance But I guess he would
nt mind my taking poor Maud instead She has nt danced hardly any
and Ive had more than my share Would it be very improper to change
my mind And Polly looked up at her tall partner with eye which plainly
showed that the change was a sacrifice

Not a bit Give the little dear a good waltz and we will look on
answered Mr Sydney with a nod and smile

That is a refreshing little piece of nature said Mr Shaw as Polly
and Maud whirled away

She will make a charming little woman if she is nt spoilt

No danger of that She has got a sensible mother

I thought so And Sydney sighed for he had lately lost his own good
mother

When supper was announced Polly happened to be talking or trying to
talk to one of the poky gentlemen whom Fan had introduced He took
Miss Milton down of course put her in a corner and having served her
to a dab of ice and one macaroon he devoted himself to his own supper
with such interest that Polly would have fared badly if Tom had not
come and rescued her

Ive been looking everywhere for you Come with me and dont sit
starving here said Tom with a scornful look from her empty plate to
that of her recreant escort which was piled with good things

Following her guide Polly was taken to the big china closet opening
from the diningroom to the kitchen and here she found a jovial little
party feasting at ease Maud and her bosom friend Gwace were seated
on tin cakeboxes Sherry and Spider adorned the refrigerator while Tom
and Rumple foraged for the party

Heres fun said Polly as she was received with a clash of spoons
and a waving of napkins

You just perch on that crackerkeg and Ill see that you get enough
said Tom putting a dumbwaiter before her and issuing his orders with a
fine air of authority

We are a band of robbers in our cave and Im the captain and we
pitch into the folks passing by and go out and bring home plunder Now
Rumple you go and carry off a basket of cake and Ill watch here till
Katy comes by with a fresh lot of oysters Polly must have some Sherry
cut into the kitchen and bring a cup of coffee Spider scrape up the
salad and poke the dish through the slide for more Eat away Polly
and my men will be back with supplies in a jiffy

Such fun as they had in that closet such daring robberies of jellypots
and cakeboxes such successful raids into the diningroom and kitchen
such base assaults upon poor Katy and the colored waiter who did his
best but was helpless in the hands of the robber horde A very harmless
little revel for no wine was allowed and the gallant band were so
busy skirmishing to supply the ladies that they had not time to eat
too much No one missed them and when they emerged the feast was over
except for a few voracious young gentlemen who still lingered among the
ruins

Thats the way they always do poke the girls in corners giveem
just one taste of something and then go and stuff like pigs whispered
Tom with a superior air forgetting certain private banquets of his
own after company had departed

The rest of the evening was to be devoted to the German and as Polly
knew nothing about it she established herself in a window recess to
watch the mysteries For a time she enjoyed it for it was all new to
her and the various pretty devices were very charming but by and by
that bitter weed envy cropped up again and she could not feel happy
to be left out in the cold while the other girls were getting gay
tissuepaper suits droll bonbons flowers ribbons and all manner of
tasteful trifles in which girlish souls delight Everyone was absorbed
Mr Sydney was dancing Tom and his friends were discussing baseball on
the stairs and Mauds set had returned to the library to play

Polly tried to conquer the bad feeling but it worried her till she
remembered something her mother once said to her When you feel out
of sorts try to make some one else happy and you will soon be so
yourself

I will try it thought Polly and looked round to see what she could
do Sounds of strife in the library led her to enter Maud and the young
ladies were sitting on the sofa talking about each others clothes as
they had seen their mammas do

Was your dress imported asked Grace

No was yours returned Blanche

Yes and it cost oh ever so much

I dont think it is as pretty as Mauds

Mine was made in New York said Miss Shaw smoothing her skirts
complacently

I cant dress much now you knowcause mammas in black for
somebody observed Miss Alice Lovett feeling the importance which
affliction conferred upon her when it took the form of a jet necklace

Well I dont care if my dress is nt imported my cousin had three
kinds of wine at her party so now said Blanche

Did she And all the little girls looked deeply impressed till Maud
observed with a funny imitation of her fathers manner My papa said
it was scandillus for some of the little boys got tipsy and had to
be tooked home He would nt let us have any wine and gwandma said it
was vewy impwoper for childwen to do so

My mother says your mothers coup is nt half so stylish as ours put
in Alice

Yes it is too Its all lined with gween silk and thats nicer
than old wed cloth cried Maud ruffling up like an insulted chicken

Well my brother dont wear a horrid old cap and hes got nice hair
I would nt have a brother like Tom Hes horrid rude my sister says
retorted Alice

He is nt Your brother is a pig

Youre a fib

So are you

Here I regret to say Miss Shaw slapped Miss Lovett who promptly
returned the compliment and both began to cry

Polly who had paused to listen to the edifying chat parted the
belligerents and finding the poor things tired cross and sleepy
yet unable to go home till sent for proposed to play games The
young ladies consented and Puss in the corner proved a peacemaker
Presently in came the boys and being exiles from the German
gladly joined in the games which soon were lively enough to wake the
sleepiest Blindmansbuff was in full swing when Mr Shaw peeped in
and seeing Polly flying about with bandaged eyes joined in the fun to
puzzle her He got caught directly and great merriment was caused by
Pollys bewilderment for she could nt guess who he was till she felt
the bald spot on his head

This frolic put every one in such spirits that Polly forgot her
trouble and the little girls kissed each other goodnight as
affectionately as if such things as imported frocks coups and rival
brothers did nt exist Well Polly do you like parties asked Fan
when the last guest was gone

Very much but I dont think it would be good for me to go to many
answered Polly slowly

Why not

I should nt enjoy them if I did nt have a fine dress and dance all
the time and be admired and all the rest of it

I did nt know you cared for such things cried Fanny surprised

Neither did I till tonight but I do and as I cant haveem its
lucky Im going home tomorrow

Oh dear So you are What shall I do without mysweet P as Sydney
calls you sighed Fanny bearing Polly away to be cuddled

Every one echoed the exclamation next day and many loving eyes followed
the little figure in the drab frock as it went quietly about doing for
the last time the small services which would help to make its absence
keenly felt Polly was to go directly after an early dinner and having
packed her trunk all but one tray she was told to go and take a run
while grandma finished Polly suspected that some pleasant surprise
was going to be put in for Fan did nt offer to go with her Maud kept
dodging about with something under her apron and Tom had just whisked
into his mothers room in a mysterious manner So Polly took the hint
and went away rejoicing in the thought of the unknown treasures she was
to carry home

Mr Shaw had not said he should come home so early but Polly thought he
might and went to meet him Mr Shaw did nt expect to see Polly for
he had left her very busy and now a light snow was falling but as he
turned into the mall there was the round hat and under it the bright
face looking all the rosier for being powdered with snowflakes as
Polly came running to meet him

There wont be any one to help the old gentleman safely home
tomorrow he said as Polly took his hand in both hers with an
affectionate squeeze

Yes there will see if there is nt cried Polly nodding and
smiling for Fan had confided to her that she meant to try it after her
friend had gone

Im glad of it But my dear I want you to promise that you will
come and make us a visit every winter a good long one said Mr Shaw
patting the blue mittens folded round his hand

If they can spare me from home Id love to come dearly

They must lend you for a little while because you do us all good and
we need you

Do I I dont see how but Im glad to hear you say so cried Polly
much touched

I cant tell you how exactly but you brought something into my house
that makes it warmer and pleasanter and wont quite vanish I hope
when you go away my child

Polly had never heard Mr Shaw speak like that before and did nt know
what to say she felt so proud and happy at this proof of the truth of
her mothers words when she said that even a little girl could exert
an influence and do some good in this big busy world She only gave
her friend a grateful look sweeter than any words and they went on
together hand in hand through the softfalling snow

If Polly could have seen what went into that top tray she would have
been entirely overcome for Fanny had told grandma about the poor little
presents she had once laughed at and they had all laid their heads
together to provide something really fine and appropriate for every
member of the Milton family Such a mine of riches and so much
goodwill affection and kindly forethought was packed away in the
tempting bundles that no one could feel offended but would find an
unusual charm about the pretty gifts that made them doubly welcome I
only know that if Polly had suspected that a little watch was ticking
away in a little case with her name on it inside that trunk she never
could have left it locked as grandma advised or have eaten her dinner
so quietly As it was her heart was very full and the tears rose to
her eyes more than once everyone was so kind and so sorry to have her
go

Tom did nt need any urging to play escort now and both Fan and Maud
insisted on going too Mrs Shaw forgot her nerves and put up some
gingerbread with her own hands Mr Shaw kissed Polly as if she had
been his dearest daughter and grandma held her close whispering in a
tremulous tone My little comfort come again soon while Katy waved
her apron from the nursery window crying as they drove away The
saints bless ye Miss Polly dear and sind ye the best of lucks

But the crowning joke of all was Toms goodby for when Polly was
fairly settled in the car the last All aboard uttered and the train
in motion Tom suddenly produced a knobby little bundle and thrusting
it in at the window while he hung on in some breakneck fashion said
with a droll mixture of fun and feeling in his face Its horrid
but you wanted it so I put it in to make you laugh Goodby Polly
goodby goodby

The last adieu was a trifle husky and Tom vanished as it was uttered
leaving Polly to laugh over his parting souvenir till the tears ran down
her cheeks It was a paper bag of peanuts and poked down at the very
bottom a photograph of Tom It was horrid for he looked as if taken
by a flash of lightning so black wild and staring was it but Polly
liked it and whenever she felt a little pensive at parting with her
friends she took a peanut or a peep at Toms funny picture which made
her merry again

So the short journey came blithely to an end and in the twilight she
saw a group of loving faces at the door of a humble little house which
was more beautiful than any palace in her eyes for it was home




CHAPTER VIII SIX YEARS AFTERWARD


WHAT do you think Polly is going to do this winter exclaimed Fanny
looking up from the letter she had been eagerly reading

Going to deliver lectures on Womans Rights said the young gentleman
who was carefully examining his luxuriant crop of decidedly auburn hair
as he lounged with both elbows on the chimneypiece

Going to set her cap for some young minister and marry him in the
spring added Mrs Shaw whose mind ran a good deal upon matchmaking
just now

I think she is going to stay at home and do all the workcause
servants cost so much it would be just like her observed Maud who
could pronounce the letter R now

Its my opinion she is going to open a school or something of that
sort to help those brothers of hers along said Mr Shaw who had put
down his paper at the sound of Pollys name

Every one of you wrong though papa comes nearest the truth cried
Fanny she is going to give music lessons and support herself so that
Will may go to college He is the studious one and Polly is very proud
of him Ned the other brother has a business talent and dont care
for books so he has gone out West and will make his own way anywhere
Polly says she is nt needed at home now the family is so small and
Kitty can take her place nicely so she is actually going to earn her
own living and hand over her share of the family income to Will What a
martyr that girl does make of herself and Fanny looked as solemn as if
Polly had proposed some awful selfsacrifice

She is a sensible bravehearted girl and I respect her for doing it
said Mr Shaw emphatically One never knows what may happen and it
does no harm for young people to learn to be independent

If she is as pretty as she was last time I saw her shell get pupils
fast enough I would nt mind taking lessons myself was the gracious
observation of Shaw Jr as he turned from the mirror with the
soothing certainty that his objectionable hair actually was growing
darker

She would nt take you at any price said Fanny remembering Pollys
look of disappointment and disapproval when she came on her last visit
and found him an unmistakable dandy

You just wait and see was the placid reply

If Polly does carry out her plan I wish Maud to take lessons of her
Fanny can do as she likes but it would please me very much to have one
of my girls sing as Polly sings It suits old people better than your
opera things and mother used to enjoy it so much

As he spoke Mr Shaws eye turned toward the corner of the fire where
grandma used to sit The easychair was empty now the kind old face was
gone and nothing but a very tender memory remained

Id like to learn papa and Polly is a splendid teacher I know she
s always so patient and makes everything so pleasant I do hope she
will get scholars enough to begin right away said Maud

When is she coming asked Mrs Shaw quite willing to help Polly
but privately resolving that Maud should be finished off by the most
fashionable master in the city

She does nt say She thanks me for asking her here as usual but says
she shall go right to work and had better begin with her own little room
at once Wont it seem strange to have Polly in town and yet not with
us

Well get her somehow The little room will cost something and she
can stay with us just as well as not even if she does teach Tell her I
say so said Mr Shaw

She wont come I know for if she undertakes to be independent she
ll do it in the most thorough manner answered Fanny and Mrs Shaw
sincerely hoped she would It was all very well to patronize the little
musicteacher but it was not so pleasant to have her settled in the
family

I shall do what I can for her among my friends and I dare say she will
get on very well with young pupils to begin with If she starts right
puts her terms high enough and gets a few good names to give her the
entre into our first families I dont doubt she will do nicely for I
must say Polly has the manners of a lady observed Mrs Shaw

Shes a mighty taking little body and Im glad shes to be in town
though Id like it better if she did nt bother about teaching but
just stayed here and enjoyed herself said Tom lazily

Ive no doubt she would feel highly honored to be allowed to devote
her time to your amusement but she cant afford expensive luxuries and
she dont approve of flirting so you will have to let her go her own
way and refresh herself with such glimpses of you as her engagements
permit answered Fanny in the sarcastic tone which was becoming
habitual to her

You are getting to be a regular old maid Fan as sharp as a lemon and
twice as sour returned Tom looking down at her with an air of calm
superiority

Do be quiet children you know I cant bear anything like contention
Maud give me my Shetland shawl and put a cushion at my back

As Maud obeyed her mother with a reproving look at her erring brother
and sister a pause followed for which every one seemed grateful They
were sitting about the fire after dinner and all looked as if a little
sunshine would do them good It had been a dull November day but all of
a sudden the clouds lifted and a bright ray shot into the room Every
one turned involuntarily to welcome it and every one cried out Why
Polly for there on the threshold stood a brightfaced girl smiling as
if there was no such thing as November weather in the world

You dear thing when did you come cried Fanny kissing both the
blooming checks with real affection while the rest hovered near
waiting for a chance

I came yesterday and have been getting my nest in order but I could
nt keep away any longer so I ran up to say How do you do answered
Polly in the cheery voice that did ones heart good to hear

My Polly always brings the sunshine with her and Mr Shaw held out
his hands to his little friend for she was his favorite still

It was good to see her put both arms about his neck and give him a
tender kiss that said a great deal for grandma had died since Polly
met him last and she longed to comfort him seeing how gray and old he
had grown

If Tom had had any thoughts of following his fathers example something
in Pollys manner made him change his mind and shake hands with a
hearty Im very glad to see you Polly adding to himself as he
looked at the face in the modest little bonnet Prettier than ever by
Jove

There was something more than mere prettiness in Pollys face though
Tom had not learned to see it yet The blue eyes were clear and steady
the fresh mouth frank and sweet the white chin was a very firm one in
spite of the dimple and the smooth forehead under the little curls
had a broad benevolent arch while all about the face were those
unmistakable lines and curves which can make even a plain countenance
comely by breathing into it the beauty of a lovely character Polly had
grown up but she had no more style now than in the days of the round
hat and rough coat for she was all in gray like a young Quakeress
with no ornament but a blue bow at the throat and another in the hair
Yet the plain suit became her excellently and one never thought of the
dress looking at the active figure that wore it for the freedom of her
childhood gave to Polly that good gift health and every movement was
full of the vigor grace and ease which nothing else can so surely
bestow A happy soul in a healthy body is a rare sight in these days
when doctors flourish and every one is ill and this pleasant union was
the charm which Polly possessed without knowing it

It does seem so good to have you here again said Maud cuddling
Pollys cold hand as she sat at her feet when she was fairly
established between Fanny and Mr Shaw while Tom leaned on the back of
his mothers chair and enjoyed the prospect

How do you get on When do you begin Where is your nest Now tell all
about it began Fanny who was full of curiosity about the new plan

I shall get on very well I think for Ive got twelve scholars to
begin with all able to pay a good price and I shall give my first
lesson on Monday

Dont you dread it asked Fanny

Not much why should I answered Polly stoutly

Well I dont know its a new thing and must be a little bit hard at
first stammered Fanny not liking to say that working for ones living
seemed a dreadful hardship to her

It will be tiresome of course but I shall get used to it I shall
like the exercise and the new people and places I must see will amuse
me Then the independence will be delightful and if I can save a little
to help Kitty along with that will be best of all

Pollys face shone as if the prospect was full of pleasure instead of
work and the hearty good will with which she undertook the new task
seemed to dignify her humble hopes and plans and make them interesting
in the sight of others

Who have you got for pupils asked Mrs Shaw forgetting her nerves
for a minute

Polly named her list and took a secret satisfaction in seeing the
impression which certain names made upon her hearers

How in the world did you get the Davenports and the Greys my dear
said Mrs Shaw sitting erect in her surprise

Mrs Davenport and mother are relations you know

You never told us that before The Davenports have been away some
years and I forgot all about them But when I was making my plan I
knew I must have a good name or two to set me going so I just wrote
and asked Mrs D if she would help me She came and saw us and was very
kind and has got these pupils for me like a dear good woman as she
is

Where did you learn so much worldly wisdom Polly asked Mr Shaw
as his wife fell back in her chair and took out her salts as if this
discovery had been too much for her

I learnt it here sir answered Polly laughing I used to think
patronage and things of that sort very disagreeable and not worth
having but Ive got wiser and to a certain extent Im glad to use
whatever advantages I have in my power if they can be honestly got

Why did nt you let us help you in the beginning We should have been
very glad to Im sure put in Mrs Shaw who quite burned to be known
as a joint patroness with Mrs Davenport

I know you would but you have all been so kind to me I did nt want
to trouble you with my little plans till the first steps were taken
Besides I did nt know as you would like to recommend me as a teacher
though you like me well enough as plain Polly

My dear of course I would and we want you to take Maud at once
and teach her your sweet songs She has a fine voice and is really
suffering for a teacher

A slight smile passed over Pollys face as she returned her thanks for
the new pupil for she remembered a time when Mrs Shaw considered her
sweet songs quite unfit for a fashionable young ladys repertoire
Where is your room asked Maud

My old friend Miss Mills has taken me in and I am nicely settled
Mother did nt like the idea of my going to a strange boardinghouse
so Miss Mills kindly made a place for me You know she lets her rooms
without board but she is going to give me my dinners and Im to get
my own breakfast and tea quite independently I like that way and it
s very little trouble my habits are so simple a bowl of bread and
milk night and morning with baked apples or something of that sort is
all I want and I can have it when I like

Is your room comfortably furnished Cant we lend you anything my
dear An easychair now or a little couch so necessary when one comes
in tired said Mrs Shaw taking unusual interest in the affair

Thank you but I dont need anything for I brought all sorts of home
comforts with me Oh Fan you ought to have seen my triumphal entry
into the city sitting among my goods and chattels in a farmers cart
Pollys laugh was so infectious that every one smiled and forgot to be
shocked at her performance Yes she added I kept wishing I could
meet you just to see your horrified face when you saw me sitting on
my little sofa with boxes and bundles all round me a birdcage on one
side a fishing basket with a kittens head popping in and out of the
hole on the other side and jolly old Mr Brown in his blue frock
perched on a keg of apples in front It was a lovely bright day and I
enjoyed the ride immensely for we had all sorts of adventures

Oh tell about it begged Maud when the general laugh at Pollys
picture had subsided

Well in the first place we forgot my ivy and Kitty came running
after me with it Then we started again but were soon stopped by a
great shouting and there was Will racing down the hill waving a pillow
in one hand and a squash pie in the other How we did laugh when he
came up and explained that our neighbor old Mrs Dodd had sent in a
hoppillow for me in case of headache and a pie to begin housekeeping
with She seemed so disappointed at being too late that Will promised
to get them to me if he ran all the way to town The pillow was easily
disposed of but that pie I do believe it was stowed in every part of
the wagon and never staid anywhere I found it in my lap then on the
floor next upside down among the books then just on the point
of coasting off a trunk into the road and at last it landed in my
rockingchair Such a remarkable pie as it was too for in spite of all
its wanderings it never got spilt or broken and we finally ate it for
lunch in order to be left in peace Next my kitty got away and I
had a chase over walls and brooks before I got her while Mr Brown
sat shaking with fun to see me run We finished off by having the
bookshelves tumble on our heads as we went down a hill and losing
my chair off behind as we went up a hill A shout made us pause and
looking back there was the poor little chair rocking all by itself in
the middle of the road while a small boy sat on the fence and whooped
It was great fun I do assure you

Polly had run on in her lively way not because she thought her
adventures amounted to much but from a wish to cheer up her friends
who had struck her as looking rather dull and out of sorts especially
Mr Shaw and when she saw him lean back in his chair with the old
hearty laugh she was satisfied and blessed the unlucky pie for amusing
him

Oh Polly you do tell such interesting things sighed Maud wiping
her eyes

I wish Id met you Id have given you three cheers and a tiger for
it must have been an imposing spectacle said Tom

No you would nt youd have whisked round the corner when you saw me
coming or have stared straight before you utterly unconscious of the
young woman in the baggage wagon

Polly laughed in his face just as she used to do when she said that
and in spite of the doubt cast upon his courtesy Tom rather liked it
though he had nothing to say for himself but a reproachful Now Polly
thats too bad

True nevertheless You must come and see my pets Maud for my cat
and bird live together as happily as brother and sister said Polly
turning to Maud who devoured every word she said

Thats not saying much for them muttered Tom feeling that Polly
ought to address more of her conversation to him

Polly knows what shes talking about her brothers appreciate their
sisters observed Fanny in her sharp tone

And Polly appreciates her brothers dont forget to add that maam
answered Tom

Did I tell you that Will was going to college broke in Polly to
avert the rising storm

Hope hell enjoy himself observed Tom with the air of a man who
had passed through all the mysteries and reached that state of sublime
indifference which juniors seem to pride themselves upon

I think he will he is so fond of study and is so anxious to improve
every opportunity I only hope he wont overwork and get sick as so
many boys do said simple Polly with such a respectful belief in the
eager thirst for knowledge of collegians as a class that Tom regarded
the deluded girl with a smile of lofty pity from the heights of his
vast and varied experience

Guess he wont hurt himself Ill see that he dont study too hard
And Toms eyes twinkled as they used to do when he planned his boyish
pranks

Im afraid you cant be trusted as a guide if various rumors I
ve heard are true said Polly looking up at him with a wistful
expression that caused his face to assume the sobriety of an owls

Base slanders Im as steady as a clock an ornament to my class and
a model young man aint I mother And Tom patted her thin cheek with
a caressing hand sure of one firm friend in her for when he ceased to
be a harumscarum boy Mrs Shaw began to take great pride in her son
and he missing grandma tried to fill her place with his feeble mother

Yes dear you are all I could ask and Mrs Shaw looked up at him
with such affection and confidence in her eyes that Polly gave Tom the
first approving look she had vouchsafed him since she came

Why Tom should look troubled and turn grave all at once she could
nt understand but she liked to see him stroke his mothers cheek so
softly as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair
for Polly fancied that he felt a mans pity for her weakness and was
learning a sons patient love for a mother who had had much to bear with
him

Im so glad you are going to be here all winter for we are to be
very gay and I shall enjoy taking you round with me began Fanny
forgetting Pollys plan for a moment

Polly shook her head decidedly It sounds very nice but it cant be
done Fan for Ive come to work not play to save not spend and
parties will be quite out of the question for me

You dont intend to work all the time without a bit of fun I hope
cried Fanny dismayed at the idea

I mean to do what Ive undertaken and not to be tempted away from
my purpose by anything I should nt be fit to give lessons if I was
up late should I And how far would my earnings go towards dress
carriages and all the little expenses which would come if I set up for
a young lady in society I cant do both and Im not going to try
but I can pick up bits of fun as I go along and be contented with free
concerts and lectures seeing you pretty often and every Sunday Will is
to spend with me so I shall have quite as much dissipation as is good
for me

If you dont come to my parties Ill never forgive you said Fanny
as Polly paused while Tom chuckled inwardly at the idea of calling
visits from a brother dissipation

Any small party where it will do to wear a plain black silk I can
come to but the big ones must nt be thought of thank you

It was charming to see the resolution of Pollys face when she said
that for she knew her weakness and beyond that black silk she had
determined not to go Fanny said no more for she felt quite sure that
Polly would relent when the time came and she planned to give her
a pretty dress for a Christmas present so that one excuse should be
removed

I say Polly wont you give some of us fellows music lessons
Somebody wants me to play and Id rather learn of you than any Senor
Twankydillo said Tom who did nt find the conversation interesting

Oh yes if any of you boys honestly want to learn and will behave
yourselves Ill take you but I shall charge extra answered Polly
with a wicked sparkle of the eye though her face was quite sober and
her tone delightfully businesslike

Why Polly Tom is nt a boy hes twenty and he says I must treat
him with respect Besides hes engaged and does put on such airs
broke in Maud who regarded her brother as a venerable being

Who is the little girl asked Polly taking the news as a joke

Trix why did nt you know it answered Maud as if it had been an
event of national importance

No is it true Fan and Polly turned to her friend with a face full
of surprise while Tom struck an imposing attitude and affected absence
of mind

I forgot to tell you in my last letter its just out and we dont
like it very well observed Fanny who would have preferred to be
engaged first herself

Its a very nice thing and I am perfectly satisfied announced Mrs
Shaw rousing from a slight doze

Polly looks as if she did nt believe it Have nt I the appearance
ofthe happiest man alive asked Tom wondering if it could be pity
which he saw in the steady eyes fixed on him

No I dont think you have she said slowly

How the deuce should a man look then cried Tom rather nettled at
her sober reception of the grand news

As if he had learned to care for some one a great deal more than for
himself answered Polly with sudden color in her cheeks and a sudden
softening of the voice as her eyes turned away from Tom who was the
picture of a complacent dandy from the topmost curl of his auburn head
to the tips of his aristocratic boots

Tommys quenched I agree with you Polly I never liked Trix and
I hope its only a boyandgirl fancy that will soon die a natural
death said Mr Shaw who seemed to find it difficult to help falling
into a brown study in spite of the lively chatter going on about him

Shaw Jr being highly incensed at the disrespectful manner in
which his engagement was treated tried to assume a superb air of
indifference and finding that a decided failure was about to stroll
out of the room with a comprehensive nod when his mother called after
him Where are you going dear

To see Trix of course Goodby Polly and Mr Thomas departed
hoping that by the skillful change of tone from ardent impatience to
condescending coolness he had impressed one hearer at least with the
fact that he regarded Trix as the star of his existence and Polly as a
presuming little chit

If he could have heard her laugh and Fannys remarks his wrath would
have boiled over fortunately he was spared the trial and went away
hoping that the coquetries of his Trix would make him forget Pollys
look when she answered his question

My dear that boy is the most deluded creature you ever saw began
Fanny as soon as the front door banged Belle and Trix both tried to
catch him and the slyest got him for in spite of his airs he is
as softhearted as a baby You see Trix has broken off two engagements
already and the third time she got jilted herself Such a fuss as she
made I declare it really was absurd But I do think she felt it very
much for she would nt go out at all and got thin and pale and blue
and was really quite touching I pitied her and had her here a good
deal and Tom took her part he always does stand up for the crushed
ones and thats good of him I allow Well she did the forsaken very
prettily let Tom amuse her and led him on till the poor fellow lost
his wits and finding her crying one day about her hat which was nt
becoming he thought she was mourning for Mr Banks and so to comfort
her the goose proposed That was all she wanted she snapped him up at
once and there he is in a nice scrape for since her engagement she is
as gay as ever flirts awfully with any one who comes along and keeps
Tom in a fume all the time I really dont think he cares for her half
as much as he makes believe but hell stand by her through thick and
thin rather than do as Banks did

Poor Tom was all Polly said when Fan had poured the story into her
ear as they sat whispering in the sofa corner

My only consolation is that Trix will break off the affair before
spring she always does so that she may be free for the summer
campaign It wont hurt Tom but I hate to have him make a fool of
himself out of pity for he is more of a man than he seems and I dont
want any one to plague him

No one but yourself said Polly smiling

Well thats all fair he is a torment sometimes but Im rather fond
of him in spite of it I get so tired of the other fellows they are
such absurd things and when Tom is in his good mood he is very nice and
quite refreshing

Im glad to hear it said Polly making a mental note of the fact

Yes and when grandma was ill he was perfectly devoted I did nt know
the boy had so much gentleness in him He took her death sadly to heart
for though he did nt say much he was very grave and steady for a long
time I tried to comfort him and we had two or three real sweet little
talks together and seemed to get acquainted for the first time It was
very nice but it did nt last good times never do with us We soon got
back into the old way and now we hector one another just as before

Fanny sighed then yawned and fell into her usual listless attitude as
if the brief excitement of Pollys coming had begun to subside

Walk home with me and see my funny little room Its bright now and
the air will do you good Come both of you and have a frolic as we
used to said Polly for the red sunset now burning in the west seemed
to invite them out

They agreed and soon the three were walking briskly away to Pollys new
home in a quiet street where a few old trees rustled in the summer
and the morning sun shone pleasantly in winter time

 The way into my parlor
 Is up a winding stair

sang Polly running up two flights of broad oldfashioned steps and
opening the door of a back room out of which streamed the welcome glow
of firelight

These are my pets Maud she added pausing on the threshold and
beckoning the girls to look in quietly

On the rug luxuriously basking in the warmth lay a gray kitten and
close by meditatively roosting on one leg stood a plump canary who
cocked his bright eye at the newcomers gave a loud chirp as if to wake
his comrade and then flew straight to Pollys shoulder where he broke
into a joyful song to welcome his mistress home

Allow me to introduce my family said Polly this noisy little chap
the boys named Nicodemus and this dozy cat is called Ashputtel because
the joy of her life is to get among the cinders Now take off your
things and let me do the honors for you are to stop to tea and the
carriage is to come for you at eight I arranged it with your mother
while you were upstairs

I want to see everything said Maud when the hats were off and the
hands warmed

So you shall for I think my housekeeping arrangements will amuse you

Then Polly showed her kingdom and the three had a merry time over it
The big piano took up so much room there was no place for a bed but
Polly proudly displayed the resources of her chintzcovered couch for
the back let down the seat lifted up and inside were all the pillows
and blankets So convenient you see and yet out of the way in the
daytime for two or three of my pupils come to me explained Polly

Then there was a bright drugget over the faded carpet the little
rockingchair and sewingtable stood at one window the ivy ran all over
the other and hid the banqueting performances which went on in that
corner Bookshelves hung over the sofa a picture or two on the
walls and a great vase of autumn leaves and grasses beautified the low
chimneypiece It was a very humble little room but Polly had done her
best to make it pleasant and it already had a homelike look with the
cheery fire and the household pets chirping and purring confidingly on
the rug

How nice it is exclaimed Maud as she emerged from the big closet
where Polly kept her stores Such a cunning teakettle and saucepan
and a teteatete set and lots of good things to eat Do have toast for
tea Polly and let me make it with the new toasting fork its such
fun to play cook

Fanny was not so enthusiastic as her sister for her eyes saw many
traces of what seemed like poverty to her but Polly was so gay so
satisfied with her small establishment so full of happy hopes and
plans that her friend had not the heart to find a fault or suggest an
improvement and sat where she was told laughing and talking while the
others got tea

This will be a country supper girls said Polly bustling about
Here is real cream brown bread homemade cake and honey from my own
beehives Mother fitted me out with such a supply Im glad to have a
party for I cant eat it all quick enough Butter the toast Maudie
and put that little cover over it Tell me when the kettle boils and
dont step on Nicodemus whatever you do

What a capital housekeeper you will make some day said Fanny as she
watched Polly spread her table with a neatness and despatch which was
pleasant to behold

Yes its good practice laughed Polly filling her tiny teapot and
taking her place behind the tray with a matronly air which was the
best joke of the whole

This is the most delicious party I ever went to observed Maud with
her mouth full of honey when the feast was well under way I do wish
I could have a nice room like this and a cat and a bird that would nt
eat each other up and a dear little teakettle and make just as much
toast as I like

Such a peal of laughter greeted Mauds pensive aspiration that Miss
Mills smiled over her solitary cup of tea and little Nick burst into a
perfect ecstasy of song as he sat on the sugarbowl helping himself

I dont care for the toast and the kettle but I do envy you your good
spirits Polly said Fanny as the merriment subsided Im so tired
of everybody and everything it seems sometimes as if I should die of
ennui Dont you ever feel so

Things worry me sometimes but I just catch up a broom and sweep or
wash hard or walk or go at something with all my might and I usually
find that by the time I get through the worry is gone or Ive got
courage enough to bear it without grumbling answered Polly cutting
the brown loaf energetically

I cant do those things you know theres no need of it and I
dont think theyd cure my worrying said Fanny languidly feeding
Ashputtel who sat decorously beside her at the table winking at the
cream pot

A little poverty would do you good Fan just enough necessity to keep
you busy till you find how good work is and when you once learn that
you wont complain of ennui any more returned Polly who had taken
kindly the hard lesson which twenty years of cheerful poverty had taught
her

Mercy no I should hate that but I wish some one would invent a new
amusement for rich people Im dead sick of parties and flirtations
trying to outdress my neighbors and going the same round year after
year like a squirrel in a cage

Fannys tone was bitter as well as discontented her face sad as well as
listless and Polly had an instinctive feeling that some trouble more
real than any she had ever known before was lying heavy at her friends
heart That was not the time to speak of it but Polly resolved to stand
ready to offer sympathy if nothing more whenever the confidential
minute came and her manner was so kind so comfortable that Fanny felt
its silent magic grew more cheerful in the quiet atmosphere of that
little room and when they said goodnight after an oldtime gossip by
the fire she kissed her hostess warmly saying with a grateful look
Polly dear I shall come often you do me so much good




CHAPTER IX LESSONS


THE first few weeks were hard ones for Polly had not yet outgrown her
natural shyness and going among so many strangers caused her frequent
panics But her purpose gave her courage and when the ice was once
broken her little pupils quickly learned to love her The novelty soon
wore off and though she thought she was prepared for drudgery she
found it very tedious to go on doing the same thing day after day Then
she was lonely for Will could only come once a week her leisure hours
were Fannys busiest and the bits of pleasure were so few and far
between that they only tantalized her Even her small housekeeping lost
its charms for Polly was a social creature and the solitary meals were
often sad ones Ashputtel and Nick did their best to cheer her but
they too seemed to pine for country freedom and home atmosphere Poor
Puttel after gazing wistfully out of the window at the gaunt city cats
skulking about the yard would retire to the rug and curl herself up as
if all hope of finding congenial society had failed while little Nick
would sing till he vibrated on his perch without receiving any response
except an inquisitive chirp from the pert sparrows who seemed to twit
him with his captivity Yes by the time the little teakettle had lost
its brightness Polly had decided that getting ones living was no
joke and many of her brilliant hopes had shared the fate of the little
kettle

If one could only make the sacrifice all at once and done with it then
it would seem easier but to keep up a daily sacrifice of ones wishes
tastes and pleasures is rather a hard task especially when one is
pretty young and gay Lessons all day a highly instructive lecture
books over a solitary fire or music with no audience but a sleepy
cat and a bird with his head tucked under his wing for evening
entertainment was not exactly what might be called festive so
in spite of her brave resolutions Polly did long for a little fun
sometimes and after saying virtuously to herself at nine Yes it is
much wiser and better for me to go to bed early and be ready for work
tomorrow she would lie awake hearing the carriages roll to and fro
and imagining the gay girls inside going to party opera or play till
Mrs Dodds hop pillow might as well have been stuffed with nettles for
any sleep it brought or any use it was except to catch and hide the
tears that dropped on it when Pollys heart was very full

Another thorn that wounded our Polly in her first attempt to make her
way through the thicket that always bars a womans progress was the
discovery that working for a living shuts a good many doors in ones
face even in democratic America As Fannys guest she had been in spite
of poverty kindly received wherever her friend took her both as child
and woman Now things were changed the kindly people patronized the
careless forgot all about her and even Fanny with all her affection
felt that Polly the music teacher would not be welcome in many places
where Polly the young lady had been accepted as Miss Shaws friend

Some of the girls still nodded amiably but never invited her to visit
them others merely dropped their eyelids and went by without speaking
while a good many ignored her as entirely as if she had been invisible
These things hurt Polly more than she would confess for at home every
one worked and every one was respected for it She tried not to care
but girls feel little slights keenly and more than once Polly was
severely tempted to give up her plan and run away to the safe shelter
at home

Fanny never failed to ask her to every sort of festivity in the Shaw
mansion but after a few trials Polly firmly declined everything but
informal visits when the family were alone She soon found that even
the new black silk was nt fine enough for Fannys smallest party and
after receiving a few of the expressive glances by which women convey
their opinion of their neighbors toilet and overhearing a joke or two
about that inevitable dress and the little blackbird Polly folded
away the once treasured frock saying with a choke in her voice I
ll wear it for Will he likes it and clothes cant change his love for
me

I am afraid the wholesome sweetness of Pollys nature was getting a
little soured by these troubles but before lasting harm was done she
received from an unexpected source some of the real help which teaches
young people how to bear these small crosses by showing them the
heavier ones they have escaped and by giving them an idea of the higher
pleasures one may earn in the good oldfashioned ways that keep hearts
sweet heads sane hands busy

Everybody has their days of misfortune like little Rosamond and Polly
was beginning to think she had more than her share One of these ended
in a way which influenced her whole life and so we will record it It
began early for the hardhearted little grate would nt behave itself
till she had used up a ruinous quantity of kindlings Then she scalded
poor Puttel by upsetting her coffeepot and instead of a leisurely
cosy meal had to hurry away uncomfortably for everything went wrong
even to the coming off of both bonnet strings in the last dreadful
scramble Being late she of course forgot her music and hurrying back
for it fell into a puddle which capped the climax of her despair

Such a trying morning as that was Polly felt out of tune herself and
all the pianos seemed to need a tuner as much as she did The pupils
were unusually stupid and two of them announced that their mamma was
going to take them to the South whither she was suddenly called This
was a blow for they had just begun and Polly had nt the face to send
in a bill for a whole quarter though her plans and calculations were
sadly disturbed by the failure of that sum

Trudging home to dinner tired and disappointed poor Polly received
another blow which hurt her more than the loss of all her pupils As
she went hurrying along with a big music book in one hand and a paper
bag of rolls for tea in the other she saw Tom and Trix coming As she
watched them while they slowly approached looking so gay and handsome
and happy it seemed to Polly as if all the sunshine and good walking
was on their side of the street all the wintry wind and mud on hers
Longing to see a friendly face and receive a kind word she crossed
over meaning to nod and smile at least Trix saw her first and
suddenly became absorbed in the distant horizon Tom apparently did not
see her for his eyes were fixed on a fine horse just prancing by
Polly thought that he had seen her and approached with a curious little
flutter at her heart for if Tom cut her she felt that her cup would be
full

On they came Trix intent on the view Tom staring at the handsome
horse and Polly with red checks expectant eyes and the brown bundle
in full sight One dreadful minute as they came parallel and no one
spoke or bowed then it was all over and Polly went on feeling as if
some one had slapped her in the face She would nt have believed it
of Tom it was all the doings of that horrid Trix well she would nt
trouble him any more if he was such a snob as to be ashamed of her just
because she carried bundles and worked for her bread She clutched the
paper bag fiercely as she said this to herself then her eyes filled
and her lips trembled as she added How could he do it before her
too

Now Tom was quite guiltless of this offence and had always nodded to
Polly when they met but it so happened he had always been alone till
now and that was why it cut so deeply especially as Polly never had
approved of Trix Before she could clear her eyes or steady her face
a gentleman met her lifted his hat smiled and said pleasantly Good
morning Miss Polly Im glad to meet you Then with a sudden change
of voice and manner he added I beg pardon is anything the matter can
I be of service

It was very awkward but it could nt be helped and all Polly could do
was to tell the truth and make the best of it

Its very silly but it hurts me to be cut by my old friends I shall
get used to it presently I dare say

Mr Sydney glanced back recognized the couple behind them and
turned round with a disgusted expression Polly was fumbling for her
handkerchief and without a word he took both book and bundle from her
a little bit of kindness that meant a good deal just then Polly felt
it and it did her good hastily wiping the traitorous eyes she laughed
and said cheerfully There Im all right again thank you dont
trouble yourself with my parcels

No trouble I assure you and this book reminds me of what I was about
to say Have you an hour to spare for my little niece Her mother wants
her to begin and desired me to make the inquiry

Did she really and Polly looked up at him as if she suspected him
of inventing the whole thing out of kindness

Mr Sydney smiled and taking a note from his pocket presented it
saying with a reproachful look Behold the proof of my truth and
never doubt again

Polly begged pardon read the note from the little girls mother which
was to have been left at her room if she was absent and gave the
bearer a very grateful look as she accepted this welcome addition to her
pupils Well pleased at the success of his mission Sydney artfully led
the conversation to music and for a time Polly forgot her woes talking
enthusiastically on her favorite theme As she reclaimed her book and
bag at her own door she said in her honest way Thank you very much
for trying to make me forget my foolish little troubles

Then let me say one thing more though appearances are against him
I dont believe Tom Shaw saw you Miss Trix is equal to that sort of
thing but it is nt like Tom for with all his foppery he is a good
fellow at heart

As Mr Sydney said this Polly held out her hand with a hearty Thank
you for that The young man shook the little hand in the gray woollen
glove gave her exactly the same bow which he did the Honorable Mrs
Davenport and went away leaving Polly to walk up stairs and address
Puttel with the peculiar remark You are a true gentleman so kind
to say that about Tom Ill think its so anyway and wont I teach
Minnie in my very best style

Puttel purred Nick chirped approvingly and Polly ate her dinner with
a better appetite than she had expected But at the bottom of her heart
there was a sore spot still and the afternoon lessons dragged dismally
It was dusk when she got home and as she sat in the firelight eating
her bread and milk several tears bedewed the little rolls and even the
home honey had a bitter taste

Now this wont do she broke out all at once this is silly and
wicked and cant be allowed Ill try the old plan and put myself
right by doing some little kindness to somebody Now what shall it be
O I know Fan is going to a party tonight Ill run up and help her
dress she likes to have me and I enjoy seeing the pretty things Yes
and Ill take her two or three clusters of my daphne its so sweet

Up got Polly and taking her little posy trotted away to the Shaws
determined to be happy and contented in spite of Trix and hard work

She found Fanny enduring torment under the hands of the hairdresser
who was doing his best to spoil her hair and distort her head with
a mass of curls braids frizzles and puffs for though I discreetly
refrain from any particular description still judging from the present
fashions I think one may venture to predict that six years hence they
would be something frightful

How kind of you Polly I was just wishing you were here to arrange my
flowers These lovely daphnes will give odor to my camellias and you
were a dear to bring them Theres my dress how do you like it said
Fanny hardly daring to lift her eyes from under the yellow tower on her
head

Its regularly splendid but how do you ever get into it answered
Polly surveying with girlish interest the cloud of pink and white lace
that lay upon the bed

Its fearfully and wonderfully made but distractingly becoming as
you shall see Trix thinks Im going to wear blue so she has got a
green one and told Belle it would spoil the effect of mine as we are
much together of course Was nt that sweet of her Belle came and told
me in time and I just got pink so my amiable sister that is to be
wont succeed in her pretty little plot

I guess she has been reading the life of Josephine You know she made
a pretty lady of whom she was jealous sit beside her on a green sofa
which set off her own white dress and spoilt the blue one of her guest
answered Polly busy with the flowers

Trix never reads anything you are the one to pick up clever little
stories Ill remember and use this one Am I done Yes that is
charming is nt it Polly and Fan rose to inspect the success of
Monsieurs long labor

You know I dont appreciate a stylish coiffure as I ought so I like
your hair in the old way best But this isthe thing I suppose and
not a word must be said

Of course it is Why child I have frizzed and burnt my hair so that I
look like an old maniac with it in its natural state and have to repair
damages as well as I can Now put the flowers just here and Fanny laid
a pink camellia in a nest of fuzz and stuck a spray of daphne straight
up at the back of her head

O Fan dont it looks horridly so cried Polly longing to add a
little beauty to her friends sallow face by a graceful adjustment of
the flowers

Cant help it thats the way and so it must be answered Fan
planting another sprig halfway up the tower

Polly groaned and offered no more suggestions as the work went on but
when Fan was finished from top to toe she admired all she honestly
could and tried to keep her thoughts to herself But her frank face
betrayed her for Fanny turned on her suddenly saying You may as
well free your mind Polly for I see by your eyes that something dont
suit

I was only thinking of what grandma once said that modesty had gone
out of fashion answered Polly glancing at the waist of her friends
dress which consisted of a belt a bit of lace and a pair of shoulder
straps

Fanny laughed goodnaturedly saying as she clasped her necklace If I
had such shoulders as yours I should nt care what the fashion was Now
dont preach but put my cloak on nicely and come along for Im to
meet Tom and Trix and promised to be there early

Polly was to be left at home after depositing Fan at Belles

I feel as if I was going myself she said as they rolled along

I wish you were and you would be Polly if you werent such a
resolute thing Ive teased and begged and offered anything I have if
youll only break your absurd vow and come and enjoy yourself

Thank you but I wont so dont trouble your kind heart about me Im
all right said Polly stoutly

But when they drew up before the lighted house and she found herself
in the midst of the pleasant stir of festivity the coming and going of
carriages the glimpses of bright colors forms and faces the bursts
of music and a general atmosphere of gayety Polly felt that she was
nt all right and as she drove away for a dull evening in her lonely
little room she just cried as heartily as any child denied a stick of
candy

Its dreadful wicked of me but I cant help it she sobbed to
herself in the corner of the carriage That music sets me all in a
twitter and I should have looked nice in Fans blue tarlatan and
I know I could behave as well as any one and have lots of partners
though Im not in that set Oh just one good gallop with Mr Sydney or
Tom No Tom would nt ask me there and I would nt accept if he did
Oh me oh me I wish I was as old and homely and good and happy as
Miss Mills

So Polly made her moan and by the time she got home was just in the
mood to go to bed and cry herself to sleep as girls have a way of doing
when their small affliction becomes unbearable

But Polly did nt get a chance to be miserable very long for as she
went up stairs feeling like the most injured girl in the world she
caught a glimpse of Miss Mills sewing away with such a bright face that
she could nt resist stopping for a word or two

Sit down my dear Im glad to see you but excuse me if I go on with
my work as Im in a driving hurry to get these things done tonight
said the brisk little lady with a smile and a nod as she took a new
needleful of thread and ran up a seam as if for a wager

Let me help you then Im lazy and cross and it will do me good
said Polly sitting down with the resigned feeling Well if I cant be
happy I can be useful perhaps

Thank you my dear yes you can just hem the skirt while I put in the
sleeves and that will be a great lift

Polly put on her thimble in silence but as Miss Mills spread the white
flannel over her lap she exclaimed Why it looks like a shroud Is it
one

No dear thank God it is nt but it might have been if we had nt
saved the poor little soul cried Miss Mills with a sudden brightening
of the face which made it beautiful in spite of the stiff gray curl
that bobbed on each temple the want of teeth and a crooked nose

Will you tell me about it I like to hear your adventures and good
works so much said Polly ready to be amused by anything that made her
forget herself

Ah my dear its a very common story and thats the saddest part of
it Ill tell you all about it for I think you may be able to help me
Last night I watched with poor Mary Floyd Shes dying of consumption
you know began Miss Mills as her nimble fingers flew and her kind
old face beamed over the work as if she put a blessing in with every
stitch Mary was very low but about midnight fell asleep and I was
trying to keep things quiet when Mrs Finn shes the woman of the
house came and beckoned me out with a scared face Little Jane has
killed herself and I dont know what to do she said leading me up to
the attic

Who was little Jane broke in Polly dropping her work

I only knew her as a pale shy young girl who went in and out and
seldom spoke to any one Mrs Finn told me she was poor but a busy
honest little thing who did nt mix with the other folks but lived
and worked alone She has looked so downhearted and pale for a week
that I thought she was sick and asked her about it said Mrs Finn
but she thanked me in her bashful way and said she was pretty well so
I let her alone But tonight as I went up late to bed I was kind of
impressed to look in and see how the poor thing did for she had nt
left her room all day I did look in and heres what I found As Mrs
Finn ended she opened the door of the back attic and I saw about as sad
a sight as these old eyes ever looked at

O what cried Polly pale now with interest

A bare room cold as a barn and on the bed a little dead white face
that almost broke my heart it was so thin so patient and so young On
the table was a bottle half full of laudanum an old pocketbook and a
letter Read that my dear and dont think hard of little Jane

Polly took the bit of paper Miss Mills gave her and read these words

DEAR MRS FINN Please forgive me for the trouble I make you but I
dont see any other way I cant get work that pays enough to keep me
the Dr says I cant be well unless I rest I hate to be a burden so
Im going away not to trouble anybody anymore Ive sold my things to
pay what I owe you Please let me be as I am and dont let people come
and look at me I hope it is nt very wicked but there dont seem
any room for me in the world and Im not afraid to die now though
I should be if I stayed and got bad because I had nt strength to keep
right Give my love to the baby and so goodby goodby

JANE BRYANT

O Miss Mills how dreadful cried Polly with her eyes so full she
could hardly read the little letter

Not so dreadful as it might have been but a bitter sad thing to
see that child only seventeen lying there in her little clean old
nightgown waiting for death to come and take her becausethere did
nt seem to be any room for her in the world Ah well we saved her
for it was nt too late thank heaven and the first thing she said was
Oh why did you bring me back Ive been nursing her all day hearing
her story and trying to show her that there is room and a welcome for
her Her mother died a year ago and since then she has been struggling
along alone She is one of the timid innocent humble creatures who
cant push their way and so get put aside and forgotten She has
tried all sorts of poorly paid work could nt live on it decently got
discouraged sick frightened and could see no refuge from the big bad
world but to get out of it while she was nt afraid to die A very old
story my dear new and dreadful as it seems to you and I think it
wont do you any harm to see and help this little girl who has gone
through dark places that you are never like to know

I will indeed I will do all I can Where is she now asked Polly
touched to the heart by the story so simple yet so sad

There and Miss Mills pointed to the door of her own little bedroom
She was well enough to be moved tonight so I brought her home and
laid her safely in my bed Poor little soul she looked about her for
a minute then the lost look went away and she gave a great sigh and
took my hand in both her thin bits of ones and said O maam I feel
as if Id been born into a new world Help me to begin again and I
ll do better So I told her she was my child now and might rest here
sure of a home as long as I had one

As Miss Mills spoke in her motherly tone and cast a proud and happy
look toward the warm and quiet nest in which she had sheltered this
friendless little sparrow feeling sure that God meant her to keep it
from falling to the ground Polly put both arms about her neck and
kissed her withered cheek with as much loving reverence as if she had
been a splendid saint for in the likeness of this plain old maid she
saw the lovely charity that blesses and saves the world

How good you are Dear Miss Mills tell me what to do let me help you
Im ready for anything said Polly very humbly for her own troubles
looked so small and foolish beside the stern hardships which had nearly
had so tragical an end that she felt heartily ashamed of herself and
quite burned to atone for them

Miss Mills stopped to stroke the fresh cheek opposite to smile and
say Then Polly I think Ill ask you to go in and say a friendly
word to my little girl The sight of you will do her good and you have
just the right way of comforting people without making a fuss

Have I said Polly looking much gratified by the words

Yes dear youve the gift of sympathy and the rare art of showing it
without offending I would nt let many girls in to see my poor Jenny
because theyd only flutter and worry her but youll know what to do
so go and take this wrapper with you its done now thanks to your
nimble fingers

Polly threw the warm garment over her arm feeling a thrill of gratitude
that it was to wrap a living girl in and not to hide away a young heart
that had grown cold too soon Pushing open the door she went quietly
into the dimly lighted room and on the pillow saw a face that drew her
to it with an irresistible power for it was touched by a solemn shadow
that made its youth pathetic As she paused at the bedside thinking the
girl asleep a pair of hollow dark eyes opened wide and looked up at
her startled at first then softening with pleasure at sight of the
bonny face before them and then a humble beseeching expression filled
them as if asking pardon for the rash act nearly committed and pity
for the hard fate that prompted it Polly read the language of these
eyes and answered their mute prayer with a simple eloquence that said
more than any words for she just stooped down and kissed the poor child
with her own eyes full and lips that trembled with the sympathy she
could not tell Jenny put both arms about her neck and began to shed
the quiet tears that so refresh and comfort heavy hearts when a tender
touch unseals the fountain where they lie

Everybody is so kind she sobbed and I was so wicked I dont
deserve it

Oh yes you do dont think of that but rest and let us pet you The
old life was too hard for such a little thing as you and we are going
to try and make the new one ever so much easier and happier said
Polly forgetting everything except that this was a girl like herself
who needed heartening up

Do you live here asked Jenny when her tears were wiped away still
clinging to the newfound friend

Yes Miss Mills lets me have a little room up stairs and there I have
my cat and bird my piano and my posy pots and live like a queen You
must come up and see me tomorrow if you are able Im often lonely
for there are no young people in the house to play with me answered
Polly smiling hospitably

Do you sew asked Jenny

No Im a music teacher and trot round giving lessons all day

How beautiful it sounds and how happy you must be so strong and
pretty and able to go round making music all the time sighed Jenny
looking with respectful admiration at the plump firm hand held in both
her thin and feeble ones

It did sound pleasant even to Pollys ears and she felt suddenly so
rich and so contented that she seemed a different creature from the
silly girl who cried because she could nt go to the party It passed
through her mind like a flash the contrast between her life and that
of the wan creature lying before her and she felt as if she could not
give enough out of her abundance to this needy little sister who had
nothing in the wide world but the life just saved to her That minute
did more for Polly than many sermons or the wisest books for it
brought her face to face with bitter truths showed her the dark side
of life and seemed to blow away her little vanities her frivolous
desires like a wintry wind that left a wholesome atmosphere behind
Sitting on the bedside Polly listened while Jane told the story which
was so new to her listener that every word sank deep into her heart
and never was forgotten

Now you must go to sleep Dont cry nor think nor do anything but
rest That will please Miss Mills best Ill leave the doors open and
play you a lullaby that you cant resist Good night dear And with
another kiss Polly went away to sit in the darkness of her own room
playing her softest airs till the tired eyes below were shut and little
Jane seemed to float away on a sea of pleasant sounds into the happier
life which had just dawned for her

Polly had fully intended to be very miserable and cry herself to sleep
but when she lay down at last her pillow seemed very soft her little
room very lovely with the firelight flickering on all the homelike
objects and her newblown roses breathing her a sweet goodnight She
no longer felt an injured hardworking unhappy Polly but as if quite
burdened with blessings for which she was nt half grateful enough She
had heard of poverty and suffering in the vague faroff way which is
all that many girls safe in happy homes ever know of it but now she
had seen it in a shape which she could feel and understand and life
grew more earnest to her from that minute So much to do in the great
busy world and she had done so little Where should she begin
Then like an answer came little Jennys words now taking anew
significance to Pollys mind To be strong and beautiful and go
round making music all the time Yes she could do that and with a
very earnest prayer Polly asked for the strength of an upright soul
the beauty of a tender heart the power to make her life a sweet and
stirring song helpful while it lasted remembered when it died

Little Janes last thought had been to wish with all her might that
God would bless the dear kind girl up there and give her all she
asked I think both prayers although too humble to be put in words
went up together for in the fulness of time they were beautifully
answered




CHAPTER X BROTHERS AND SISTERS


POLLYS happiest day was Sunday for Will never failed to spend it with
her Instead of sleeping later than usual that morning she was always
up bright and early flying round to get ready for her guest for Will
came to breakfast and they made a long day of it Will considered his
sister the best and prettiest girl going and Polly knowing well that a
time would come when he would find a better and a prettier was grateful
for his good opinion and tried to deserve it So she made her room and
herself as neat and inviting as possible and always ran to meet him
with a bright face and a motherly greeting when he came tramping in
ruddy brisk and beaming with the brown loaf and the little pot of
beans from the bakehouse near by

They liked a good country breakfast and nothing gave Polly more
satisfaction than to see her big boy clear the dishes empty the little
coffeepot and then sit and laugh at her across the ravaged table
Another pleasure was to let him help clear away as they used to do
at home while the peals of laughter that always accompanied this
performance did Miss Mills heart good to hear for the room was so
small and Will so big that he seemed to be everywhere at once and Polly
and Puttel were continually dodging his long arms and legs Then they
used to inspect the flower pots pay Nick a visit and have a little
music as a good beginning for the day after which they went to church
and dined with Miss Mills who considered Will an excellent young
man If the afternoon was fair they took a long walk together over
the bridges into the country or about the city streets full of Sabbath
quietude Most people meeting them would have seen only an awkward young
man with a boys face atop of his tall body and a quietly dressed
fresh faced little woman hanging on his arm but a few people with eyes
to read romances and pleasant histories everywhere found something very
attractive in this couple and smiled as they passed wondering if they
were young lovers or country cousins looking round

If the day was stormy they stayed at home reading writing letters
talking over their affairs and giving each other good advice for
though Will was nearly three years younger than Polly he could nt for
the life of him help assuming amusingly venerable airs when he became
a Freshman In the twilight he had a good lounge on the sofa and Polly
sung to him which arrangement he particularly enjoyed it was so cosy
and homey At nine oclock Polly packed his bag with clean clothes
nicely mended such remnants of the festive tea as were transportable
and kissed him goodnight with many injunctions to muffle up his
throat going over the bridge and be sure that his feet were dry
and warm when he went to bed All of which Will laughed at accepted
graciously and did nt obey but he liked it and trudged away for
another weeks work rested cheered and strengthened by that quiet
happy day with Polly for he had been brought up to believe in home
influences and this brother and sister loved one another dearly and
were not ashamed to own it

One other person enjoyed the humble pleasures of these Sundays quite as
much as Polly and Will Maud used to beg to come to tea and Polly glad
to do anything for those who had done a good deal for her made a point
of calling for the little girl as they came home from their walk or
sending Will to escort her in the carriage which Maud always managed
to secure if bad weather threatened to quench her hopes Tom and Fanny
laughed at her fancy but she did not tire of it for the child was
lonely and found something in that little room which the great house
could not give her

Maud was twelve now a pale plain child with sharp intelligent eyes
and a busy little mind that did a good deal more thinking than anybody
imagined She was just at the unattractive fidgety age when no one
knew what to do with her and so let her fumble her way up as she could
finding pleasure in odd things and living much alone for she did not
go to school because her shoulders were growing round and Mrs
Shaw would not allow her figure to be spoiled That suited Maud
excellently and whenever her father spoke of sending her again or
getting a governess she was seized with bad headaches a pain in her
back or weakness of the eyes at which Mr Shaw laughed but let her
holiday go on Nobody seemed to care much for plain pugnosed little
Maudie her father was busy her mother nervous and sick Fanny absorbed
in her own affairs and Tom regarded her as most young men do their
younger sisters as a person born for his amusement and convenience
nothing more Maud admired Tom with all her heart and made a little
slave of herself to him feeling well repaid if he merely said Thank
you chicken or did nt pinch her nose or nip her ear as he had a
way of doing just as if I was a doll or a dog and had nt got any
feelings she sometimes said to Fanny when some service or sacrifice
had been accepted without gratitude or respect It never occurred to
Tom when Maud sat watching him with her face full of wistfulness that
she wanted to be petted as much as ever he did in his neglected boyhood
or that when he called her Pug before people her little feelings were
as deeply wounded as his used to be when the boys called him Carrots
He was fond of her in his fashion but he did nt take the trouble to
show it so Maud worshipped him afar off afraid to betray the affection
that no rebuff could kill or cool

One snowy Sunday afternoon Tom lay on the sofa in his favorite attitude
reading Pendennis for the fourth time and smoking like a chimney as
he did so Maud stood at the window watching the falling flakes with an
anxious countenance and presently a great sigh broke from her

Dont do that again chicken or youll blow me away Whats the
matter asked Tom throwing down his book with a yawn that threatened
dislocation

Im afraid I cant go to Pollys answered Maud disconsolately

Of course you cant its snowing hard and father wont be home
with the carriage till this evening What are you always cutting off to
Pollys for

I like it we have such nice times and Will is there and we bake
little johnnycakes in the baker before the fire and they sing and it
is so pleasant

Warbling johnnycakes must be interesting Come and tell me all about
it

No youll only laugh at me

I give you my word I wont if I can help it but I really am dying of
curiosity to know what you do down there You like to hear secrets so
tell me yours and Ill be as dumb as an oyster

It is nt a secret and you would nt care for it Do you want another
pillow she added as Tom gave his a thump

This will do but why you women always stick tassels and fringe all
over a sofacushion to tease and tickle a fellow is what I dont
understand

One thing that Polly does Sunday nights is to take Wills head in her
lap and smooth his forehead It rests him after studying so hard she
says If you dont like the pillow I could do that for youcause you
look as if you were more tired of studying than Will said Maud with
some hesitation but an evident desire to be useful and agreeable

Well I dont care if you do try it for I am confoundedly tired And
Tom laughed as he recalled the frolic he had been on the night before

Maud established herself with great satisfaction and Tom owned that a
silk apron was nicer than a fuzzy cushion

Do you like it she asked after a few strokes over the hot forehead
which she thought was fevered by intense application to Greek and Latin

Not bad play away was the gracious reply as Tom shut his eyes
and lay so still that Maud was charmed at the success of her attempt
Presently she said softly Tom are you asleep

Just turning the corner

Before you get quite round would you please tell me what a Public
Admonition is

What do you want to know for demanded Tom opening his eyes very
wide

I heard Will talking about Publics and Privates and I meant to ask
him but I forgot

What did he say

I dont remember it was about somebody who cut prayers and got
a Private and had done all sorts of bad things and had one or two
Publics I did nt hear the name and did nt care I only wanted to know
what the words meant

So Will tells tales does he and Toms forehead wrinkled with a
frown

No he did nt Polly knew about it and asked him

Wills adig growled Tom shutting his eyes again as if nothing
more could be said of the delinquent William

I dont care if he is I like him very much and so does Polly

Happy Fresh said Tom with a comical groan

You need nt sniff at him for he is nice and treats me with respect
cried Maud with an energy that made Tom laugh in her face

Hes good to Polly always and puts on her cloak for her and saysmy
dear and kisses hergoodnight and dont think its silly and I
wish I had a brother just like him yes I do And Maud showed signs of
woe for her disappointment about going was very great

Bless my boots whats the chicken ruffling up her little feathers and
pecking at me for Is that the way Polly soothes the best of brothers
said Tom still laughing

Oh I forgot there I wont cry but I do want to go and Maud
swallowed her tears and began to stroke again

Now Toms horse and sleigh were in the stable for he meant to drive out
to College that evening but he did nt take Mauds hint It was less
trouble to lie still and say in a conciliatory tone Tell me some more
about this good boy its very interesting

No I shant but Ill tell about Puttels playing on the piano said
Maud anxious to efface the memory of her momentary weakness Polly
points to the right key with a little stick and Puttel sits on the
stool and pats each key as its touched and it makes a tune Its
so funny to see her and Nick perches on the rack and sings as if hed
kill himself

Very thrilling said Tom in a sleepy tone

Maud felt that her conversation was not as interesting as she hoped and
tried again

Polly thinks you are handsomer than Mr Sydney

Much obliged

I asked which she thought had the nicest face and she said yours was
the handsomest and his the best

Does he ever go there asked a sharp voice behind them and looking
round Maud saw Fanny in the big chair cooking her feet over the
register

I never saw him there he sent up some books one day and Will teased
her about it

What did she do demanded Fanny Oh she shook him

What a spectacle and Tom looked as if he would have enjoyed seeing
it but Fannys face grew so forbidding that Toms little dog who was
approaching to welcome her put his tail between his legs and fled under
the table

Then there is nt any Sparking Sunday night sung Tom who appeared
to have waked up again

Of course not Polly is nt going to marry anybody shes going to
keep house for Will when hes a minister I heard her say so cried
Maud with importance

What a fate for pretty Polly ejaculated Tom

She likes it and Im sure I should think she would its beautiful
to hearem plan it all out

Any more gossip to retail Pug asked Tom a minute after as Maud
seemed absorbed in visions of the future

He told a funny story about blowing up one of the professors You
never told us so I suppose you did nt know it Some bad fellow put a
torpedo or some sort of powder thing under the chair and it went off
in the midst of the lesson and the poor man flew up frightened most
to pieces and the boys ran with pails of water to put the fire out But
the thing that made Will laugh most was that the very fellow who did it
got his trousers burnt trying to put out the fire and he asked the is
it Faculty or President

Either will do murmured Tom who was shaking with suppressed
laughter

Well he askedem to give him some new ones and they did give him
money enough for a nice pair but he got some cheap ones with horrid
great stripes onem and always woreem to that particular class
which was one too many for the fellows Will said and with the rest
of the money he had a punch party Was nt it dreadful

Awful And Tom exploded into a great laugh that made Fanny cover her
ears and the little dog bark wildly

Did you know that bad boy asked innocent Maud

Slightly gasped Tom in whose wardrobe at college those identical
trousers were hanging at that moment

Dont make such a noise my head aches dreadfully said Fanny
fretfully

Girls heads always do ache answered Tom subsiding from a roar into
a chuckle

What pleasure you boys can find in such ungentlemanly things I dont
see said Fanny who was evidently out of sorts

As much a mystery to you as it is to us how you girls can like to
gabble and prink from one weeks end to the other retorted Tom

There was a pause after this little passageatarms but Fan wanted to
be amused for time hung heavily on her hands so she asked in a more
amiable tone Hows Trix

As sweet as ever answered Tom gruffly

Did she scold you as usual

She just did

What was the matter

Well Ill leave it to you if this is nt unreasonable she wont
dance with me herself yet dont like me to go it with anybody else I
said I thought if a fellow took a girl to a party she ought to dance
with him once at least especially if they were engaged She said that
was the very reason why she should nt do it so at the last hop I let
her alone and had a gay time with Belle and today Trix gave it to me
hot and heavy coming home from church

If you go and engage yourself to a girl like that I dont know what
you can expect Did she wear her Paris hat today added Fan with
sudden interest in her voice

She wore some sort of a blue thing with a confounded bird of Paradise
in it that kept whisking into my face every time she turned her head

Men never know a pretty thing when they see it That hat is perfectly
lovely

They know a lady when they see her and Trix dont look like one I
cant say where the trouble is but theres too much fuss and feathers
for my taste You are twice as stylish yet you never look loud or
fast

Touched by this unusual compliment Fanny drew her chair nearer as she
replied with complacency Yes I flatter myself I do know how to dress
well Trix never did shes fond of gay colors and generally looks
like a walking rainbow

Cant you give her a hint Tell her not to wear blue gloves anyway she
knows I hateem

Ive done my best for your sake Tom but she is a perverse creature
and dont mind a word I say even about things much more objectionable
than blue gloves

Maudie run and bring me my other cigar case its lying round
somewhere

Maud went and as soon as the door was shut Tom rose on his elbow
saying in a cautiously lowered voice Fan does Trix paint

Yes and draws too answered Fanny with a sly laugh

Come you know what I mean Ive a right to ask and you ought to
tell said Tom soberly for he was beginning to find that being
engaged was not unmitigated bliss

What makes you think she does

Well between ourselves said Tom looking a little sheepish but
anxious to set his mind at rest she never will let me kiss her on her
cheek nothing but an unsatisfactory peck at her lips Then the
other day as I took a bit of heliotrope out of a vase to put in my
buttonhole I whisked a drop of water into her face I was going to
wipe it off but she pushed my hand away and ran to the glass where
she carefully dabbed it dry and came back with one cheek redder than
the other I did nt say anything but I had my suspicions Come now
does she

Yes she does but dont say a word to her for shell never forgive
my telling if she knew it

I dont care for that I dont like it and I wont have it said Tom
decidedly

You cant help yourself Half the girls do it either paint or powder
darken their lashes with burnt hairpins or take cologne on lumps of
sugar or belladonna to make their eyes bright Clara tried arsenic for
her complexion but her mother stopped it said Fanny betraying the
secrets of the prisonhouse in the basest manner

I knew you girls were a set of humbugs and very pretty ones too
some of you but I cant say I like to see you painted up like a lot of
actresses said Tom with an air of disgust

I dont do anything of the sort or need it but Trix does and having
chosen her you must abide your choice for better or worse

It has nt come to that yet muttered Tom as he lay down again with a
rebellious air

Mauds return put an end to these confidences though Tom excited her
curiosity by asking the mysterious question I say Fan is Polly up to
that sort of thing

No she thinks its awful When she gets pale and dragged out she will
probably change her mind

I doubt it said Tom

Polly says it is nt proper to talk secrets before people who aint in
em observed Maud with dignity

Do for mercy sake stop talking about Polly Im sick to death of
it cried Fanny snappishly

Hullo and Tom sat up to take a survey I thought you were bosom
friends and as spoony as ever

Well I am fond of Polly but I get tired of hearing Maud sing her
praises everlastingly Now dont go and repeat that chatterbox

My goodness is nt she cross whispered Maud to Tom

As two sticks let her be Theres the bell see who it is Pug
answered Tom as a tingle broke the silence of the house

Maud went to peep over the banisters and came flying back in a rapture

Its Will come for me Cant I go It dont snow hard and Ill
bundle up and you can send for me when papa comes

I dont care what you do answered Fan who was in a very bad temper

Without waiting for any other permission Maud rushed away to get ready
Will would nt come up he was so snowy and Fanny was glad because
with her he was bashful awkward and silent so Tom went down and
entertained him with Mauds report They were very good friends but led
entirely different lives Will being a dig and Tom a bird or
in plain English one was a hard student and the other a jolly young
gentleman Tom had rather patronized Will who did nt like it and
showed that he did nt by refusing to borrow money of him or accept
any of his invitations to join the clubs and societies to which Tom
belonged So Shaw let Milton alone and he got on very well in his own
way doggedly sticking to his books and resisting all temptations
but those of certain libraries athletic games and such inexpensive
pleasures as were within his means for this benighted youth had not yet
discovered that college nowadays is a place in which to skylark not
to study

When Maud came down and trotted contentedly away holding Wills
hand Tom watched them out of sight and then strolled about the house
whistling and thinking till he went to sleep in his fathers armchair
for want of something better to do He awoke to the joys of a solitary
tea for his mother never came down and Fanny shut herself and her
headache up in her own room

Well this is cheerful he said as the clock struck eight and his
fourth cigar came to an end Trix is mad and Fan in the dumps so I
ll take myself off Guess Ill go round to Pollys and ask Will to
drive out with me and save him the walk poor chap Might bring Midget
home it will please her and theres no knowing when the governor will
be back

With these thoughts in his head Tom leisurely got under way and left
his horse at a neighboring stable for he meant to make a little call
and see what it was Maud enjoyed so much

Polly is holding forth he said to himself as he went quietly up
stairs and the steady murmur of a pleasant voice came down to him Tom
laughed at Pollys earnest way of talking when she was interested
in anything But he liked it because it was so different from the
coquettish clatter of most of the girls with whom he talked Young men
often laugh at the sensible girls whom they secretly respect and
affect to admire the silly ones whom they secretly despise because
earnestness intelligence and womanly dignity are not the fashion

The door was ajar and pausing in the dark entry Tom took a survey
before he went in The prospect was not dazzling but homelike and
pleasant The light of a bright fire filled the little room and down
on a stool before it was Maud tending Puttel and watching with deep
interest the roasting of an apple intended for her special benefit On
the couch lounged Will his thoughtful eyes fixed on Polly who while
she talked smoothed the broad forehead of her yellowhaired laddie
in a way that Tom thought an immense improvement on Mauds performance
They had evidently been building castles in the air for Polly was
saying in her most impressive manner Well whatever you do Will
dont have a great costly church that takes so much money to build
and support it that you have nothing to give away I like the plain
oldfashioned churches built for use not show where people met for
hearty praying and preaching and where everybody made their own music
instead of listening to opera singers as we do now I dont care if
the old churches were bare and cold and the seats hard there was real
piety in them and the sincerity of it was felt in the lives of the
people I dont want a religion that I put away with my Sunday clothes
and dont take out till the day comes round again I want something to
see and feel and live by daybyday and I hope youll be one of the
true ministers who can teach by precept and example how to get and
keep it

I hope I shall be Polly but you know they say that in families if
there is a boy who cant do anything else they make a minister of him
I sometimes think I aint good for much and that seems to me the reason
why I should nt even try to be a minister said Will smiling yet
looking as if with all his humility he did have faith in the aspirations
that came to him in his best moments

Some one said that very thing to father once and I remember he
answered I am glad to give my best and brightest son to the service of
God

Did he say that and Wills color rose for the big bookloving
fellow was as sensitive as a girl to the praise of those dearest to him

Yes said Polly unconsciously giving the strongest stimulus to her
brothers hope and courage Yes and he added I shall let my boys
follow the guide that is in them and only ask of them to use their
gifts conscientiously and be honest useful men

So we will Ned is doing well out West and Im hard at it here If
father does his best to give us the chance we each want the least we
can do is to work with a will

Whatever you do you cant help working with a Will cried Tom who
had been so interested that he forgot he was playing eavesdropper

Polly flew up looking so pleased and surprised that Tom reproached
himself for not having called oftener

Ive come for Maud he announced in a paternal tone which made that
young lady open her eyes

I cant go till my apple is done besides it is nt nine yet and Will
is going to take me along when he goes Id rather have him

Im going to take you both in the cutter The storm is over but it is
heavy walking so youll drive out with me old man said Tom with a
nod at Will

Of course he will and thank you very much Ive been trying to keep
him all night Miss Mills always manages to find a corner for stray
people but he insists on going so as to get to work early tomorrow
said Polly delighted to see that Tom was taking off his coat as if he
meant to wait for Mauds apple which Polly blessed for being so slow to
cook

Putting her guest into the best chair Polly sat down and beamed at him
with such hospitable satisfaction that Tom went up several pegs in his
own estimation

You dont come very often so we are rather overpowered when you do
honor us she said demurely

Well you know we fellows are so busy we have nt much time to enjoy
ourselves answered Tom

Ahem said Will loudly

Take a troche said Tom

Then they both burst out laughing and Polly fully understanding
the joke joined them saying Here are some peanuts Tom do enjoy
yourself while you can

Now I call that a delicate compliment And Tom who had not lost his
early relish for this sort of refreshment though he seldom indulged
his passion nowadays because peanuts are considered vulgar fell to
cracking and munching with great satisfaction

Do you remember the first visit I made at your house how you gave
me peanuts coming from the depot and frightened me out of my wits
pretending the coachman was tipsy asked Polly

Of course I do and how we coasted one day answered Tom laughing

Yes and the velocipede youve got the scar of that yet I see

I remember how you stood by me while it was sewed up that was very
plucky Polly

I was dreadfully afraid but I remember I wanted to seem very brave
because youd called me a coward

Did I Ought to have been ashamed of myself I used to rough you
shamefully Polly and you were so goodnatured you let me do it

Could nt help myself laughed Polly I did use to think you were an
awful boy but seems to me I rather liked it

She had so much of it at home she got used to it put in Will
pulling the little curl behind Pollys ear

You boys never teased me as Tom did thats the reason it amused me I
suppose novelty hath charms you know

Grandma used to lecture Tom for plaguing you Polly and he used to say
hed be a tiptop boy but he was nt observed Maud with a venerable
air

Dear old grandma she did her best but Im a bad lot said Tom with
a shake of the head and a sober face

It always seems as if she must be up in her rooms and I cant get used
to finding them empty added Polly softly

Father would nt have anything moved and Tom sits up there sometimes
it makes him feel good he says said Maud who had a talent for
betraying trifles which people preferred should not be mentioned in
public

Youd better hurry up your apple for if it is nt done pretty soon
youll have to leave it Pug said Tom looking annoyed

How is Fan asked Polly with tact

Well Fan is rather under the weather says shes dyspeptic which
means cross

She is cross but shes sick too for I found her crying one day and
she said nobody cared about her and she might as well be dead added
Maud having turned her apple with tender care

We must try to cheer her up among us If I was nt so busy Id like
to devote myself to her she has done so much for me said Polly
gratefully

I wish you could I cant understand her for she acts like a
weathercock and I never know how Im going to find her I hate to have
her mope so but upon my life I dont know what to do said Tom but
as he uttered the words something was suggested by the sight before
him Chairs were few and Polly had taken half of Wills when they drew
round the fire Now she was leaning against him in a cosy confiding
way delightful to behold while Wills strong arm went round her with
a protecting air which said as plainly as any words that this big
brother and small sister knew how to love and help one another It was a
pleasant little picture all the pleasanter for its unconsciousness and
Tom found it both suggestive and agreeable

Poor old Fan she dont get much petting maybe thats what she wants
Ill try it and see for she stands by me like a trump If she was
a rosy cosy little woman like Polly it would come easier though
thought Tom as he meditatively ate his last nut feeling that fraternal
affection could not be very difficult of demonstration to brothers
blessed with pretty goodtempered sisters

I told Tom about the bad fellow who blew up the professor and he said
he knew him slightly and I was so relieved because I had a kind of a
feeling that it was Tom himself you and Will laughed so about it

Maud had a queer way of going on with her own thoughts and suddenly
coming out with whatever lay uppermost regardless of time place or
company As this remark fell from her there was a general smile and
Polly said with mock solemnity It was a sad thing and Ive no doubt
that misguided young man is very sorry for it now

He looked perfectly bowed down with remorse last time I saw him said
Will regarding Tom with eyes full of fun for Will was a boy as well as
a bookworm and relished a joke as well as scatterbrained Tom

He always is remorseful after a scrape Ive understood for he is nt
a very bad fellow only his spirits are one too many for him and he is
nt as fond of his book as another fellow I know

Im afraid hell he expelled if he dont mind said Polly
warningly

Should nt wonder if he was hes such an unlucky dog answered Tom
rather soberly

I hope hell remember that his friends will be very much disappointed
if he is He might make them so proud and happy that I guess he will
for he is nt half as thoughtless as he makes himself out said Polly
looking across at Tom with such friendly eyes that he was quite touched
though of course he did nt show it

Thank you Polly he may pull through but I have my doubts Now old
man let uspud along its getting late for the chicken he added
relapsing into the graceful diction with which a classical education
gifts its fortunate possessor

Taking advantage of the moment while Will was wrestling with his boots
in the closet and Maud was absorbed in packing her apple into a large
basket Polly said to Tom in a low tone Thank you very much for being
so kind to Will

Bless your heart I have nt done anything hes such a proud fellow
he wont let me answered Tom

But you do in many little ways tonight for example Do you think
I dont know that the suit of clothes hes just got would have cost a
good deal more if your tailor had nt made them Hes only a boy
and dont understand things yet but I know your way of helping proud
people so that they dont find it out and I do thank you Tom so
much

Oh come Polly that wont do What do you know about tailors and
college matters said Tom looking as much confused as if she had found
him out in something reprehensible

I dont know much and thats the reason why Im grateful for your
kindness to Will I dont care what stories they tell about you Im
sure you wont lead him into trouble but keep him straight for my
sake You know Ive lost one brother and Will takes Jimmys place to
me now

The tears in Pollys eyes as she said that made Tom vow a tremendous vow
within himself to stand by Will through thick and thin and keep him
straight for Pollys sake feeling all the time how illfitted he was
for such a task

Ill do my best he said heartily as he pressed the hand Polly gave
him with a look which assured her that he felt the appeal to his honor
and that henceforth the country lad was safe from all the temptations
Tom could have offered him

There now I shall give that to mamma to take her pills in its
just what she likes and it pleases her to be thought of said Maud
surveying her gift with complacency as she put on her things

Youre a good little soul to remember poor mum said Tom with an
approving nod

Well she was so pleased with the grapes you brought her I thought I
d try something and maybe shed say Thank you darling to me too
Do you think she will whispered Maud with the wistful look so often
seen on her little plain face

See if she dont and to Mauds great surprise Tom did nt laugh at
her project

Good night dear take care of yourself and keep your muffler round
your mouth going over the bridge or youll be as hoarse as a crow
tomorrow said Polly as she kissed her brother who returned it
without looking as if he thought it girls nonsense Then the three
piled into the sleigh and drove off leave Polly nodding on the
doorstep

Maud found the drive altogether too short but was consoled by the
promise of a longer one if the sleighing lasted till next Saturday and
when Tom ran up to bid his mother goodby and give her a hint about
Mauds gift she stayed below to say at the last minute in unconscious
imitation of Polly

Good night take care of yourself my dear

Tom laughed and was about to pinch the much enduring little nose but
as if the words reminded him of something he gave her a kiss instead a
piece of forbearance which almost took Mauds breath away with surprise
and gratification

It was rather a silent drive for Will obediently kept his muffler up
and Tom fell into a brown study

He was not much given to reflection but occasionally indulged when
something gave him a turn in that direction and at such times he was as
sober and sincere as could be desired Any one might have lectured him
for an hour without doing as much good as that little call and the chat
that grew out of it for though nothing very wise or witty was
said many things were suggested and every one knows that persuasive
influences are better than any amount of moralizing Neither Polly nor
Will tried to do anything of the sort and that was the charm of it
Nobody likes to be talked to but nobody can resist the eloquence of
unconscious preaching With all his thoughtlessness Tom was quick to
see and feel these things and was not spoilt enough yet to laugh at
them The sight of Will and Pollys simple affection for one another
reminded him of a neglected duty so pleasantly that he could not forget
it Talking of early days made him wish he could go back and start
again doing better Grandmas name recalled the tender memory that
always did him good and the thought that Polly trusted her dearest
brother to his care stirred up a manful desire to deserve the
confidence Tortures would nt have drawn a word of all this from him
but it had its effect for boys dont leave their hearts and consciences
behind them when they enter college and little things of this sort do
much to keep both from being damaged by the four years scrimmage which
begins the battle of life for most of them




CHAPTER XI NEEDLES AND TONGUES


DEAR POLLY The Sewing Circle meets at our house this P M This is in
your line so do come and help me through I shall depend on you

Yours ever FAN

Bad news my dear asked Miss Mills who had just handed the note to
Polly as she came in one noon a few weeks after Jennys arrival

Polly told her what it was adding I suppose I ought to go and help
Fanny but I cant say I want to The girls talk about things I have
nothing to do with and I dont find their gossip very amusing Im an
outsider and they only accept me on Fans account so I sit in a corner
and sew while they chatter and laugh

Would nt it be a good chance to say a word for Jenny She wants work
and these young ladies probably have quantities done somewhere Jenny
does fine work exquisitely and begins to feel anxious to be earning
something I dont want her to feel dependent and unhappy and a little
wellpaid sewing would be all she needs to do nicely I can get it for
her by running round to my friends but I really have nt the time till
I get the Mullers off They are paupers here but out West they can take
care of themselves so Ive begged the money to send them and as soon
as I can get them some clothes off they go Thats the way to help
people help themselves and Miss Mills clashed her big scissors
energetically as she cut out a little red flannel shirt

I know it is and I want to help but I dont know where to begin
said Polly feeling quite oppressed with the immensity of the work

We cant any of us do all we would like but we can do our best for
every case that comes to us and that helps amazingly Begin with Jenny
my dear tell those girls about her and if Im not much mistaken you
will find them ready to help for half the time it is nt hardness of
heart but ignorance or thoughtlessness on the part of the rich that
makes them seem so careless of the poor

To tell the truth Im afraid of being laughed at if I try to talk
seriously about such things to the girls said Polly frankly

You believe thatsuch things are true You are sincere in your wish
to help better them and you respect those who work for that end

Yes I do

Then my dear cant you bear a little ridicule for the sake of a good
cause You said yesterday that you were going to make it a principle of
your life to help up your sex as far and as fast as you could It did
my heart good to hear you say it for I was sure that in time you would
keep your word But Polly a principle that cant bear being laughed
at frowned on and coldshouldered is nt worthy of the name

I want to be strongminded in the real sense of the word but I dont
like to be called so by people who dont understand my meaning and
I shall be if I try to make the girls think soberly about anything
sensible or philanthropic They call me oldfashioned now and Id
rather be thought that though it is nt pleasant than be set down as
a rampant womans rights reformer said Polly in whose memory many
laughs and snubs and sarcasms still lingered forgiven but not
forgotten

This love and thought and care for those weaker poorer or worse than
ourselves which we call Christian charity is a very old fashion my
dear It began eighteen hundred years ago and only those who honestly
follow the beautiful example set us then learn how to get genuine
happiness out of life Im not arampant womans rights reformer
added Miss Mills with a smile at Pollys sober face but I think that
women can do a great deal for each other if they will only stop fearing
whatpeople will think and take a hearty interest in whatever is
going to fit their sisters and themselves to deserve and enjoy the
rights God gave them There are so many ways in which this can be done
that I wonder they dont see and improve them I dont ask you to go and
make speeches only a few have the gift for that but I do want every
girl and woman to feel this duty and make any little sacrifice of time
or feeling that may be asked of them because there is so much to do
and no one can do it as well as ourselves if we only think so

Ill try said Polly influenced more by her desire to keep Miss
Mills good opinion than any love of selfsacrifice for her sex It was
rather a hard thing to ask of a shy sensitive girl and the kind old
lady knew it for in spite of the gray hair and withered face her heart
was very young and her own girlish trials not forgotten But she
knew also that Polly had more influence over others than she herself
suspected simply because of her candid upright nature and that while
she tried to help others she was serving herself in a way that would
improve heart and soul more than any mere social success she might gain
by following the rules of fashionable life which drill the character
out of girls till they are as much alike as pins in a paper and have
about as much true sense and sentiment in their little heads There was
good stuff in Polly unspoiled as yet and Miss Mills was only acting
out her principle of women helping each other The wise old lady saw
that Polly had reached that point where the girl suddenly blooms into
a woman asking something more substantial than pleasure to satisfy the
new aspirations that are born a time as precious and important to the
afterlife as the hour when the apple blossoms fall and the young
fruit waits for the elements to ripen or destroy the harvest

Polly did not know this and was fortunate in possessing a friend who
knew what influences would serve her best and who could give her what
all women should desire to give each other the example of a sweet good
life more eloquent and powerful than any words for this is a right no
one can deny us

Polly turned the matter over in her mind as she dressed while Jenny
played waiting maid little dreaming what this new friend was meaning to
do for her if she dared

Is it going to be a teaparty Miss asked Jenny as the black silk
went rustling on to her great admiration for she considered Polly a
beauty

Well no I think it will probably be a lecture answered Polly
laughing for Jennys grateful service and affectionate eyes confirmed
the purpose which Miss Mills little homily had suggested

As she entered the Shaws parlor an hour or two later an appalling
array of welldressed girls appeared each provided with a dainty
reticule basket or bag and each tongue going a good deal faster than
the needle while the white fingers stitched sleeves in upside down put
flannel jackets together hind part before or gobbled buttonholes with
the best intentions in life

You are a dear to come so early Heres a nice place for you between
Belle and Miss Perkins and heres a sweet little dress to make unless
you like something else better said Fanny receiving her friend with
warmth and placing her where she thought she would enjoy herself

Thank you Ill take an unbleached cotton shirt if you have such a
thing for it is likely to be needed before a cambric frock replied
Polly subsiding into her corner as quickly as possible for at least six
eyeglasses were up and she did nt enjoy being stared at

Miss Perkins a grave coldlooking young lady with an aristocratic
nose bowed politely and then went on with her work which displayed
two diamond rings to great advantage Belle being of the demonstrative
sort smiled and nodded drew up her chair and began a whispered
account of Trixs last quarrel with Tom Polly listened with interest
while she sewed diligently occasionally permitting her eyes to study
the elegant intricacies of Miss Perkins dress for that young lady sat
like a statue quirking her delicate fingers and accomplishing about
two stitches a minute

In the midst of Belles story a more exciting bit of gossip caught her
ear and she plunged into the conversation going on across the table
leaving Polly free to listen and admire the wit wisdom and charitable
spirit of the accomplished young ladies about her There was a perfect
Babel of tongues but out of the confusion Polly gathered scraps of
fashionable intelligence which somewhat lessened her respect for the
dwellers in high places One fair creature asserted that Joe Somebody
took so much champagne at the last German that he had to be got away
and sent home with two servants Another divulged the awful fact that
Carrie Ps wedding presents were half of them hired for the occasion
A third circulated a whisper to the effect that though Mrs Buckminster
wore a thousanddollar cloak her boys were not allowed but one sheet to
their beds And a fourth young gossip assured the company that a certain
person never had offered himself to a certain other person though
the report was industriously spread by interested parties This latter
remark caused such a clamor that Fanny called the meeting to order in a
most unparliamentary fashion

Girls girls you really must talk less and sew more or our society
will be disgraced Do you know our branch sent in less work than any of
the others last month and Mrs Fitz George said she did nt see how
fifteen young ladies could manage to do so little

We dont talk a bit more than the old ladies do I just wish you could
have heard them go on last time The way they get so much done is
they take work home and make their seamstresses do it and then they
take credit for vast industry said Belle who always spoke her mind
with charming candor

That reminds me that mamma says they want as many things as we can
make for its a hard winter and the poor are suffering very much Do
any of you wish to take articles home to do at odd times said Fan
who was president of this energetic Dorcas Society

Mercy no It takes all my leisure time to mend my gloves and refresh
my dresses answered Belle

I think if we meet once a week it is all that should be expected of
us with our other engagements Poor people always complain that the
winter is a hard one and never are satisfied remarked Miss Perkins
making her diamonds sparkle as she sewed buttons on the wrong side of a
pink calico apron which would hardly survive one washing

Nobody can ask me to do any more if they remember all Ive got to
attend to before summer said Trix with an important air Ive got
three women hard at work and want another but everyone is so busy and
ask such abominable prices that Im in despair and shall have to take
hold myself Im afraid

Theres a chance for Jane thought Polly but had nt courage to
speak out loud in meeting just then and resolved to ask Trix for
work in private

Prices are high but you forget how much more it costs to live now than
it used to do Mamma never allows us to beat down workwomen but wishes
us to pay them well and economize in some other way if we must said
Emma Davenport a quiet brighteyed girl who was called odd among
the young ladies because she dressed simply when her father was a
millionaire

Just hear that girl talk about economy I beg your pardon shes some
relation of yours I believe said Belle in a low tone

Very distant but Im proud of it for with her economy does nt mean
scrimping in one place to make a show in another If every one would
follow the Davenports example workwomen would nt starve or servants
be such a trouble Emma is the plainest dressed girl in the room next
to me yet any one can see she is a true gentlewoman said Polly
warmly

And you are another answered Belle who had always loved Polly in
her scatterbrained way

Hush Trix has the floor

If they spent their wages properly I should nt mind so much but they
think they must be as fine as anybody and dress so well that it is hard
to tell mistress from maid Why our cook got a bonnet just like mine
the materials were cheaper but the effect was the same and had the
impertinence to wear it before my face I forbid it and she left of
course which made papa so cross he would nt give me the camels hair
shawl he promised this year

Its perfectly shameful said Miss Perkins as Trix paused out of
breath Servants ought to be made to dress like servants as they do
abroad then we should have no more trouble observed Miss Perkins who
had just made the grand tour and had brought home a French maid

Perky dont practise as she preaches whispered Belle to Polly as
Miss P became absorbed in the chat of her other neighbors She pays
her chamber girl with old finery and the other day when Betsey was out
parading in her mississ castoff purple plush suit Mr Curtis thought
she was mademoiselle and bowed to her He is as blind as a bat but
recognized the dress and pulled off his hat to it in the most elegant
style Perky adores him and was mad enough to beat Betsey when she told
the story and giggled over it Betsey is quite as stylish and ever so
much prettier than Perky and she knows it which is an aggravation

Polly could nt help laughing but grew sober a minute after as Trix
said pettishly Well Im sick of hearing about beggars I believe
half of them are humbugs and if we let them alone theyd go to work
and take care of themselves Theres altogether too much fuss made
about charity I do wish we could be left in peace

There cant be too much charity burst out Polly forgetting her
shyness all at once

Oh indeed Well I take the liberty to differ from you returned
Trix putting up her glass and bestowing upon Polly her most
toploftical stare as the girls called it

I regret to say that Polly never could talk with or be near Trix without
feeling irritated and combative She tried to conquer this feeling but
she could nt and when Trix put on airs Polly felt an intense desire
to box her ears That eyeglass was her especial aversion for Trix was
no more nearsighted than herself but pretended to be because it was
the fashion and at times used the innocent glass as a weapon with which
to put down any one who presumed to set themselves up The supercilious
glance which accompanied her ironically polite speech roused Polly
who answered with sudden color and the kindling of the eyes that always
betrayed a perturbed spirit I dont think many of us would enjoy that
selfish sort of peace while little children starve and girls no older
than us kill themselves because their dreadful poverty leaves them no
choice but sin or death

A sudden lull took place for though Polly did not raise her voice it
was full of indignant emotion and the most frivolous girl there felt
a little thrill of sympathy for the most utterly fashionable life does
not kill the heart out of women till years of selfish pleasure have
passed over their heads Trix was ashamed of herself but she felt the
same antagonism toward Polly that Polly did toward her and being less
generous took satisfaction in plaguing her Polly did not know that the
secret of this was the fact that Tom often held her up as a model for
his fiance to follow which caused that young lady to dislike her more
than ever

Half the awful stories in the papers are made up for a sensation and
its absurd to believe them unless one likes to be harrowed up I
dont and as for peace Im not likely to get much while I have Tom
to look after said Trix with an aggravating laugh

Pollys needle snapped in two but she did not mind it as she said
with a look that silenced even sharptongued Trix I cant help
believing what my own eyes and ears have seen and heard You lead such
safe and happy lives you cant imagine the misery that is all round
you but if you could get a glimpse of it it would make your hearts
ache as it has mine

Do you suffer from heartache Some one hinted as much to me but you
looked so well I could nt believe it

Now that was cruel in Trix more cruel than any one guessed but girls
tongues can deal wounds as sharp and sudden as the slender stiletto
Spanish women wear in their hair and Polly turned pale as those words
stabbed her Belle saw it and rushed to the rescue with more goodwill
than wisdom

Nobody ever accused you of having any heart to ache with Polly and
I are not old enough yet to get tough and cool and we are still silly
enough to pity unhappy people Tom Shaw especially added Belle under
her breath

That was a twoedged thrust for Trix was decidedly an old girl and Tom
was generally regarded as a hapless victim Trix turned red but before
she could load and fire again Emma Davenport who labored under the
delusion that this sort of skirmishing was illnatured and therefore
illbred spoke up in her pleasant way Speaking of pitying the poor
I always wonder why it is that we all like to read and cry over their
troubles in books but when we have the real thing before us we think
it is uninteresting and disagreeable

Its the genius that gets into the books which makes us like the
poverty I fancy But I dont quite agree that the real thing is nt
interesting I think it would be if we knew how to look at and feel
it said Polly very quietly as she pushed her chair out of the arctic
circle of Miss Perkins into the temperate one of friendly Emma

But how shall we learn that I dont see what we girls can do more
than we do now We have nt much money for such things should nt know
how to use it if we had and it is nt proper for us to go poking into
dirty places to hunt up the needy Going about doing good in pony
phaetons as somebody says may succeed in England but it wont work
here said Fanny who had begun lately to think a good deal of some
one beside herself and so found her interest in her fellowbeings
increasing daily

We cant do much perhaps just yet but still there are things left
undone that naturally fall to us I know a house said Polly sewing
busily as she talked where every servant who enters it becomes an
object of interest to the mistress and her daughters These women are
taught good habits books are put where they can get them sensible
amusements are planned for them sometimes and they soon feel that they
are not considered mere scrubs to do as much work as possible for as
little money as possible but helpers in the family who are loved and
respected in proportion to their faithfulness This lady feels her duty
to them owns it and does it as conscientiously as she wants them to
do theirs by her and that is the way it ought to be I think

As Polly paused several keen eyes discovered that Emmas cheeks were
very red and saw a smile lurking in the corners of the mouth that tried
to look demure which told them who Polly meant

Do the Biddies all turn out saints in that well regulated family
asked the irrepressible Trix

No few of us do that even in the parlor but every one of the Biddies
is better for being there whether they are grateful or not I ought not
to have mentioned this perhaps but I wanted to show you one thing that
we girls can do We all complain about bad servants most as much as if
we were housekeepers ourselves but it never occurs to us to try and
mend the matter by getting up a better spirit between mistress and
maid Then theres another thing we can do added Polly warming up
Most of us find money enough for our little vanities and pleasures but
feel dreadfully poor when we come to pay for work sewing especially
Could nt we give up a few of the vanities and pay the seamstresses
better

I declare I will cried Belle whose conscience suddenly woke and
smote her for beating down the woman who did her plain sewing in order
that she might have an extra flounce on a new dress Belle has got a
virtuous fit pity it wont last a week said Trix

Wait and see retorted Belle resolving that it should last just
to disappoint that spiteful minx as she sweetly called her old
schoolmate

Now we shall behold Belle galloping away at a great pace on her new
hobby I should nt be surprised to hear of her preaching in the jail
adopting a nice dirty little orphan or passing round tracts at a
Womans Rights meeting said Trix who never could forgive Belle for
having a lovely complexion and so much hair of her own that she never
patronized either rats mice waterfalls switches or puffcombs

Well I might do worse and I think of the two Id rather amuse
myself so than as some young ladies do who get into the papers for
their pranks returned Belle with a moral air

Suppose we have a little recess and rest while Polly plays to us Will
you Polly It will do us good they all want to hear you and begged I
d ask

Then I will with pleasure and Polly went to the piano with such
obliging readiness that several reproachful glances fell upon Trix who
did nt need her glass to see them

Polly was never too sad perturbed or lazy to sing for it was almost
as easy to her as breathing and seemed the most natural outlet for her
emotions For a minute her hands wandered over the keys as if uncertain
what to play then falling into a sad sweet strain she sang The
Bridge of Sighs Polly did nt know why she chose it but the instinct
seemed to have been a true one for old as the song was it went
straight to the hearts of the hearers and Polly sung it better than
she ever had before for now the memory of little Jane lent it a tender
pathos which no art could give It did them all good for music is a
beautiful magician and few can resist its power The girls were touched
by the appeal Polly was lifted out of herself and when she turned
round the softened look on all the faces told her that for the moment
foolish differences and frivolous beliefs were forgotten in the
one womanly sentiment of pity for the wrongs and woes of which the
listeners happy lives were ignorant

That song always makes me cry and feel as if I had no right to be so
comfortable said Belle openly wiping her eyes on a crash towel

Fortunately such cases are very rare said another young lady who
seldom read the newspapers

I wish they were but Im afraid they are not for only three weeks
ago I saw a girl younger than any of us and no worse who tried to
destroy herself simply because she was so discouraged sick and poor
said Polly

Do tell about her cried Belle eagerly

Feeling that the song had paved the way for the story and given her
courage to tell it Polly did tell it and must have done it well for
the girls stopped work to listen and when she ended other eyes beside
warmhearted Belles were wet Trix looked quite subdued Miss Perkins
thawed to such a degree that something glittered on her hand as she
bent over the pink pinafore again better and brighter than her biggest
diamond Emma got up and went to Polly with a face full of affectionate
respect while Fanny moved by a sudden impulse caught up a costly
Sevres plate that stood on the etagere and laying a fivedollar bill in
it passed it round quoting Pollys words Girls I know youll like
to help poor little Jennybegin again and do better this time

It was good to see how quickly the pretty purses were out how
generously each gave of its abundance and what hearty applause broke
from the girls as Belle laid down her gold thimble saying with an
April face There take that I never have any money somehow it wont
stay with me but I cant let the plate pass me this time

When Fanny brought the contributions to Polly she just gathered it up
in her two hands with such a glad grateful face the girls wished they
had had more to give

I cant thank you enough she said with an eloquent little choke in
her voice This will help Jenny very much but the way in which it was
done will do her more good than double the money because it will prove
to her that she is nt without friends and make her feel that there is
a place in the world for her Let her work for you in return for this
she dont ask alms she only wants employment and a little kindness and
the best charity we can bestow is to see that she has both

Ill give her as much sewing as she wants and she can stay at our
house while she does it if she needs a home said Trix in a spasm of
benevolence

She does nt need a home thank you Miss Mills has given half of hers
and considers Jane her child answered Polly with proud satisfaction
in the fact

What an old dear cried Belle

I want to know her May I whispered Emma

Oh yes Im glad to make her known to any one She is a quiet little
old lady but she does one heaps of good and shows you how to be
charitable in the wisest way

Do tell us about it Im sure I want to do my duty but its such a
muddle I dont know how said Belle

Then quite naturally the conversation fell upon the great work that
none should be too busy to think of and which few are too young or
too poor to help on with their mite The faces grew more earnest the
fingers flew faster as the quick young hearts and brains took in the
new facts ideas and plans that grew out of the true stories the
sensible hints the successful efforts which Polly told them fresh from
the lips of Miss Mills for of late Polly had talked much with the
good lady and learned quickly the lessons her unselfish life conveyed
The girls found this more interesting than gossip partly owing to its
novelty doubtless but the enthusiasm was sincere while it lasted and
did them good Many of them forgot all about it in a week but Pollys
effort was not lost for Emma Belle and Fanny remained firm friends
to Jane so kindly helping her that the poor child felt as if she had
indeed been born again into a new and happy world

Not till long afterward did Polly see how much good this little effort
had done her for the first small sacrifice of this sort leads the way
to others and a single hands turn given heartily to the worlds great
work helps one amazingly with ones own small tasks Polly found this
out as her life slowly grew easier and brighter and the beautiful law
of compensation gave her better purposes and pleasures than any she had
lost The parents of some of her pupils were persons of real refinement
and such are always quick to perceive the marks of culture in others no
matter where they find them These attracted first by Pollys cheerful
face modest manners and faithful work soon found in her something
more than a good teacher they found a real talent for music an eager
desire for helpful opportunities and a heart grateful for the kindly
sympathy that makes rough places smooth Fortunately those who have the
skill to detect these traits also possess the spirit to appreciate and
often the power to serve and develop them In ways so delicate that the
most sensitive pride could not resent the favor these true gentlefolk
showed Polly their respect and regard put many pleasures in her way
and when they paid her for her work gave her also the hearty thanks
that takes away all sense of degradation even from the humblest service
for money so earned and paid sweetens the daily bread it buys and makes
the mutual obligation a mutual benefit and pleasure

A few such patrons did much for Polly and the music she gave them had
an undertone of gratitude that left blithe echoes in those great houses
which money could not buy

Then as her butterfly acquaintances deserted her she found her way
into a hive of friendly bees who welcomed her and showed her how to
find the honey that keeps life sweet and wholesome Through Miss Mills
who was the counsellor and comforter of several Polly came to know
a little sisterhood of busy happy independent girls who each had a
purpose to execute a talent to develop an ambition to achieve and
brought to the work patience and perseverance hope and courage Here
Polly found her place at once for in this little world love and liberty
prevailed talent energy and character took the first rank money
fashion and position were literally nowhere for here as in the big
world outside genius seemed to blossom best when poverty was head
gardener Young teachers doing much work for little pay young artists
trying to pencil paint or carve their way to Rome young writers
burning to distinguish themselves young singers dreaming of
triumphs great as those of Jenny Lind and some who tried to conquer
independence armed only with a needle like poor Jane All these helped
Polly as unconsciously as she helped them for purpose and principle are
the best teachers we can have and the want of them makes half the women
of America what they are restless aimless frivolous and sick

To outsiders that was a very hardworking and uneventful winter to
Polly She thought so herself but as spring came on the seed of new
virtues planted in the winter time and ripened by the sunshine of
endeavor began to bud in Pollys nature betraying their presence to
others by the added strength and sweetness of her character long before
she herself discovered these May flowers that had blossomed for her
underneath the snow




CHAPTER XII FORBIDDEN FRUIT


IM perfectly aching for some fun said Polly to herself as she
opened her window one morning and the sunshine and frosty air set her
blood dancing and her eyes sparkling with youth health and overflowing
spirits I really must break out somewhere and have a good time Its
quite impossible to keep steady any longer Now what will I do Polly
sprinkled crumbs to the doves who came daily to be fed and while she
watched the gleaming necks and rosy feet she racked her brain to devise
some unusually delightful way of enjoying herself for she really had
bottled up her spirits so long they were in a state of uncontrollable
effervescence

Ill go to the opera she suddenly announced to the doves Its
expensive I know but its remarkably good and music is such a treat
to me Yes Ill get two tickets as cheap as I can send a note to
Will poor lad he needs fun as much as I do and well go and have a
nice time in some corner as Charles Lamb and his sister used to

With that Polly slammed down the window to the dismay of her gentle
little pensioners and began to fly about with great energy singing and
talking to herself as if it was impossible to keep quiet She started
early to her first lesson that she might have time to buy the tickets
hoping as she put a fivedollar bill into her purse that they would
nt be very high for she felt that she was not in a mood to resist
temptation But she was spared any struggle for when she reached the
place the ticket office was blocked up by eager purchasers and the
disappointed faces that turned away told Polly there was no hope for
her

Well I dont care Ill go somewhere for I will have my fun she
said with great determination for disappointment only seemed to whet
her appetite But the playbills showed her nothing inviting and she was
forced to go away to her work with the money burning her pocket and all
manner of wild schemes floating in her head At noon instead of going
home to dinner she went and took an ice trying to feet very gay and
festive all by herself It was rather a failure however and after a
tour of the picture shops she went to give Maud a lesson feeling that
it was very hard to quench her longings and subside into a prim little
music teacher

Fortunately she did not have to do violence to her feelings very long
for the first thing Fanny said to her was Can you go

Where

Did nt you get my note

I did nt go home to dinner

Tom wants us to go to the opera tonight and Fan got no further for
Polly uttered a cry of rapture and clasped her hands

Go Of course I will Ive been dying to go all day tried to get
tickets this morning and could nt been fuming about it ever since and
now oh how splendid And Polly could not restrain an ecstatic skip
for this burst of joy rather upset her

Well you come to tea and well dress together and go all
comfortable with Tom who is in a heavenly frame of mind today

I must run home and get my things said Polly resolving on the spot
to buy the nicest pair of gloves the city afforded

You shall have my white cloak and any other little rigging you want
Tommy likes to have his ladies a credit to him you know said Fanny
departing to take a beauty sleep

Polly instantly decided that she would nt borrow Beckys best bonnet
as she at first intended but get a new one for in her present excited
state no extravagance seemed too prodigal in honor of this grand
occasion I am afraid that Mauds lesson was not as thorough as it
should have been for Pollys head was such a chaos of bonnets gloves
operacloaks and fans that Maud blundered through murdering time and
tune at her own sweet will The instant it was over Polly rushed away
and bought not only the kids but a bonnet frame a bit of illusion and
a pink crape rose which had tempted her for weeks in a certain
shop window then home and to work with all the skill and speed of a
distracted milliner

Im rushing madly into expense Im afraid but the fit is on me
and Ill eat bread and water for a week to make up for it I must look
nice for Tom seldom takes me and ought to be gratified when he does
I want to do like other girls just for once and enjoy myself without
thinking about right and wrong Now a bit of pink ribbon to tie it with
and I shall be done in time to do up my best collar she said turning
her boxes topsyturvy for the necessary ribbon in that delightful flurry
which young ladies feel on such occasions

It is my private opinion that the little shifts and struggles we poor
girls have to undergo beforehand give a peculiar relish to our fun when
we get it This fact will account for the rapturous mood in which Polly
found herself when after making her bonnet washing and ironing her
best set blacking her boots and mending her fan she at last like
Consuelo put on a little dress of black silk and with the smaller
adornments pinned up in a paper started for the Shaws finding it
difficult to walk decorously when her heart was dancing in her bosom

Maud happened to be playing a redowa up in the parlor and Polly came
prancing into the room so evidently spoiling for a dance that Tom who
was there found it impossible to resist catching her about the waist
and putting her through the most intricate evolutions till Mauds
fingers gave out

That was splendid Oh Tom thank you so much for asking me tonight
I feel just like having a regular good time cried Polly when she
stopped with her hat hanging round her neck and her hair looking as if
she had been out in a high wind

Glad of it I felt so myself and thought wed have a jolly little
party all in the family said Tom looking much gratified at her
delight

Is Trix sick asked Polly

Gone to New York for a week

Ah when the cats away the mice will play

Exactly Come and have another turn

Before they could start however the awful spectacle of a little dog
trotting out of the room with a paper parcel in his mouth made Polly
clasp her hands with the despairing cry My bonnet Oh my bonnet

Where what which And Tom looked about him bewildered

Snips got it Save it save it

I will And Tom gave chase with more vigor than discretion

Snip evidently regarding it as a game got up for his special benefit
enjoyed the race immensely and scampered all over the house shaking the
precious parcel like a rat while his master ran and whistled commanded
and coaxed in vain Polly followed consumed with anxiety and Maud
laughed till Mrs Shaw sent down to know who was in hysterics A
piteous yelp from the lower regions at last announced that the thief was
captured and Tom appeared bearing Snip by the nape of the neck in one
hand and Pollys cherished bonnet in the other

The little scamp was just going to worry it when I grabbed him Im
afraid he has eaten one of your gloves I cant find it and this one
is pretty well chewed up said Tom bereaving Snip of the torn kid to
which he still pertinaciously clung

Serves me right said Polly with a groan Id no business to get
a new pair but I wanted to be extra gorgeous tonight and this is my
punishment for such mad extravagance

Was there anything else asked Tom

Only my best cuffs and collar Youll probably find them in the
coalbin said Polly with the calmness of despair

I saw some little white things on the diningroom floor as I raced
through Go get them Maud and well repair damages said Tom
shutting the culprit into the boot closet where he placidly rolled
himself up and went to sleep

They aint hurt a bit proclaimed Maud restoring the lost treasures

Neither is my bonnet for which Im deeply grateful said Polly who
had been examining it with a solicitude which made Toms eyes twinkle

So am I for it strikes me that is an uncommonlynobby little
affair he said approvingly Tom had a weakness for pale pink roses
and perhaps Polly knew it

Im afraid its too gay said Polly with a dubious look

Not a bit Sort of bridal you know Must be becoming Put it on and
lets see

I would nt for the world with my hair all tumbling down Dont look
at me till Im respectable and dont tell any one how Ive been
acting I think I must be a little crazy tonight said Polly
gathering up her rescued finery and preparing to go and find Fan

Lunacy is mighty becoming Polly Try it again answered Tom
watching her as she went laughing away looking all the prettier for
her dishevelment Dress that girl up and shed be a raving tearing
beauty added Tom to Maud in a lower tone as he look her into the
parlor under his arm

Polly heard it and instantly resolved to be as raving and as tearing
as her means would allow just for one night she said as she peeped
over the banisters glad to see that the dance and the race had taken
the bandboxy air out of Toms elegant array

I deeply regret being obliged to shock the eyes and ears of such of my
readers as have a prejudice in favor of pure English by expressions like
the above but having rashly undertaken to write a little story about
Young America for Young America I feel bound to depict my honored
patrons as faithfully as my limited powers permit Otherwise I must
expect the crushing criticism Well I dare say its all very prim and
proper but it is nt a bit like us and never hope to arrive at
the distinction of finding the covers of An OldFashioned Girl the
dirtiest in the library

The friends had a social cup o tea upstairs which Polly considered
the height of luxury and then each took a mirror and proceeded to prink
to her hearts content The earnestness with which Polly made her toilet
that night was delightful to behold Feeling in a daring mood she
released her pretty hair from the braids in which she usually wore
it and permitted the curls to display themselves in all their brown
abundance especially several dangerous little ones about the temples
and forehead The putting on of the rescued collar and cuffs was a task
which absorbed her whole mind So was the settling of a minute bit of
courtplaster just to the left of the dimple in her chin an unusual
piece of coquetry in which Polly would not have indulged if an almost
invisible scratch had not given her an excuse for doing it The white
downtrimmed cloak with certain imposing ornaments on the hood
was assumed with becoming gravity and draped with much advancing and
retreating before the glass as its wearer practised the true Boston
gait elbows back shoulders forward a bend and a slide occasionally
varied by a slight skip But when that bonnet went on Polly actually
held her breath till it was safely landed and the pink rose bloomed
above the smooth waves of hair with what Fanny called a ravishing
effect At this successful stage of affairs Polly found it impossible
to resist the loan of a pair of gold bands for the wrists and Fannys
white fan with the little mirror in the middle

I can put them in my pocket if I feel too much dressed said Polly
as she snapped on the bracelets but after a wave or two of the fan she
felt that it would be impossible to take them off till the evening was
over so enticing was their glitter

Fanny also lent her a pair of threebutton gloves which completed her
content and when Tom greeted her with an approving Heres a sight
for gods and men Why Polly youre gorgeous she felt that her fun
had decidedly begun

Would nt Polly make a lovely bride said Maud who was revolving
about the two girls trying to decide whether she would have a blue or a
white cloak when she grew up and went to operas

Faith and she would Allow me to congratulate you Mrs Sydney
added Tom advancing with his weddingreception bow and a wicked look at
Fanny

Go away How dare you cried Polly growing much redder than her rose

If we are going to the opera tonight perhaps wed better start
as the carriage has been waiting some time observed Fan coolly and
sailed out of the room in an unusually lofty manner

Dont you like it Polly whispered Tom as they went down stairs
together

Very much

The deuce you do

Im so fond of music how can I help it

Im talking about Syd

Well Im not

Youd better try for him

Ill think of it

Oh Polly Polly what are you coming to

A tumble into the street apparently answered Polly as she slipped a
little on the step and Tom stopped in the middle of his laugh to pilot
her safely into the carriage where Fanny was already seated

Heres richness said Polly to herself as she rolled away feeling
as Cinderella probably did when the pumpkincoach bore her to the first
ball only Polly had two princes to think about and poor Cinderella
on that occasion had not even one Fanny did nt seem inclined to talk
much and Tom would go on in such a ridiculous manner that Polly told
him she would nt listen and began to hum bits of the opera But
she heard every word nevertheless and resolved to pay him for his
impertinence as soon as possible by showing him what he had lost

Their seats were in the balcony and hardly were they settled when by
one of those remarkable coincidences which are continually occurring
in our youth Mr Sydney and Fannys old friend Frank Moore took their
places just behind them

Oh you villain You did it on purpose whispered Polly as she turned
from greeting their neighbors and saw a droll look on Toms face

I give you my word I did nt Its the law of attraction dont you
see

If Fan likes it I dont care

She looks resigned I think

She certainly did for she was talking and laughing in the gayest manner
with Frank while Sydney was covertly surveying Polly as if he did nt
quite understand how the gray grub got so suddenly transformed into
a white butterfly It is a wellknown fact that dress plays a very
important part in the lives of most women and even the most sensible
cannot help owning sometimes how much happiness they owe to a becoming
gown gracefully arranged hair or a bonnet which brings out the best
points in their faces and puts them in a good humor A great man was
once heard to say that what first attracted him to his wellbeloved wife
was seeing her in a white muslin dress with a blue shawl on the chair
behind her The dress caught his eye and stopping to admire that the
wearers intelligent conversation interested his mind and in time the
womans sweetness won his heart It is not the finest dress which does
the most execution I fancy but that which best interprets individual
taste and character Wise people understand this and everybody is more
influenced by it than they know perhaps Polly was not very wise but
she felt that every one about her found something more attractive than
usual in her and modestly attributed Toms devotion Sydneys interest
and Franks undisguised admiration to the new bonnet or more likely
to that delightful combination of cashmere silk and swansdown
which like Charitys mantle seemed to cover a multitude of sins in
other peoples eyes and exalt the little music teacher to the rank of a
young lady

Polly scoffed at this sort of thing sometimes but tonight she accepted
it without a murmur rather enjoyed it in fact let her bracelets shine
before the eyes of all men and felt that it was good to seem comely in
their sight She forgot one thing however that her own happy spirits
gave the crowning charm to a picture which every one liked to see a
blithe young girl enjoying herself with all her heart The music and the
light costume and company excited Polly and made many things possible
which at most times she would never have thought of saying or doing She
did not mean to flirt but somehow it flirted itself and she could nt
help it for once started it was hard to stop with Tom goading
her on and Sydney looking at her with that new interest in his eyes
Pollys flirting was such a very mild imitation of the fashionable thing
that Trix  Co would not have recognized it but it did very well for a
beginner and Polly understood that night wherein the fascination of it
lay for she felt as if she had found a new gift all of a sudden and
was learning how to use it knowing that it was dangerous yet finding
its chief charm in that very fact

Tom did nt know what to make of her at first though he thought the
change uncommonly becoming and finally decided that Polly had taken his
advice and was setting her cap for Syd as he gracefully expressed
it Sydney being a modest man thought nothing of the kind but simply
fancied that little Polly was growing up to be a very charming woman He
had known her since her first visit and had always liked the child this
winter he had been interested in the success of her plans and had done
what he could to help them but he never thought of failing in love
with Polly till that night Then he began to feel that he had not fully
appreciated his young friend that she was such a bright and lovable
girl it was a pity she should not always be gay and pretty and enjoy
herself that she would make a capital wife for somebody and perhaps it
was about time to think of settling as his sister often said These
thoughts came and went as he watched the white figure in front felt
the enchantment of the music and found everybody unusually blithe and
beautiful He had heard the opera many times but it had never seemed
so fine before perhaps because he had never happened to have had an
ingenuous young face so near him in which the varying emotions born of
the music and the romance it portrayed came and went so eloquently
that it was impossible to help reading them Polly did not know that
this was why he leaned down so often to speak to her with an expression
which she did not understand but liked very much nevertheless

Dont shut your eyes Polly They are so full of mischief tonight I
like to see them said Tom after idly wondering for a minute if she
knew how long and curly her lashes were

I dont wish to look affected but the music tells the story so much
better than the acting that I dont care to look on half the time
answered Polly hoping Tom would nt see the tears she had so cleverly
suppressed

Now I like the acting best The music is all very fine I know but it
does seem so absurd for people to go round telling tremendous secrets at
the top of their voices I cant get used to it

Thats because youve more commonsense than romance I dont mind
the absurdity and quite long to go and comfort that poor girl with
the broken heart said Polly with a sigh as the curtain fell on a most
affecting tableau

Whatshisname is a great jack not to see that she adores him In
real life we fellows aint such bats as all that observed Tom who had
decided opinions on many subjects that he knew very little about and
expressed them with great candor

A curious smile passed over Pollys face and she put up her glass to
hide her eyes as she said I think you are bats sometimes but women
are taught to wear masks and that accounts for it I suppose

I dont agree Theres precious little masking nowadays wish there
was a little more sometimes added Tom thinking of several blooming
damsels whose beseeching eyes had begged him not to leave them to wither
on the parent stem

I hope not but I guess theres a good deal more than any one would
suspect

What can you know about broken hearts and blighted beings asked
Sydney smiling at the girls pensive tone

Polly glanced up at him and her face dimpled and shone again as she
answered laughing Not much my time is to come

I cant imagine you walking about the world with your back hair down
bewailing a hardhearted lover said Tom

Neither can I That would nt be my way

No Miss Polly would let concealment prey on her damask cheeks and
still smile on in the novel fashion or turn sister of charity and nurse
the heartless lover through smallpox or some other contagious disease
and die seraphically leaving him to the agonies of remorse and tardy
love

Polly gave Sydney an indignant look as he said that in a slow satirical
way that nettled her very much for she hated to be thought sentimental

Thats not my way either she said decidedly Id try to outlive
it and if I could nt Id try to be the better for it Disappointment
need nt make a woman a fool

Nor an old maid if shes pretty and good Remember that and dont
visit the sins of one blockhead on all the rest of mankind said Tom
laughing at her earnestness

I dont think there is the slightest possibility of Miss Pollys being
either added Sydney with a look which made it evident that concealment
had not seriously damaged Pollys damask cheek as yet

Theres Clara Bird I have nt seen her but once since she was
married How pretty she looks and Polly retired behind the big glass
again thinking the chat was becoming rather personal

Now theres a girl who tried a different cure for unrequited
affection from any you mention People say she was fond of Belles
brother He did nt reciprocate but went off to India to spoil his
constitution so Clara married a man twenty years older than she is and
consoles herself by being the bestdressed woman in the city

That accounts for it said Polly when Toms long whisper ended

For what

The tired look in her eyes

I dont see it said Tom after a survey through the glass

Did nt expect you would

I see what you mean A good many women have it nowadays said Sydney
over Pollys shoulder

Whats she tired of The old gentleman asked Tom

And herself added Polly

Youve been reading French novels I know you have Thats just the
way the heroines go on cried Tom

I have nt read one but its evident you have young man and youd
better stop

I dont care forem only do it to keep up my French But how came you
to be so wise maam

Observation sir I like to watch faces and I seldom see a grownup
one that looks perfectly happy

True for you Polly no more you do now I think of it I dont know
but one that always looks so and there it is

Where asked Polly with interest

Look straight before you and youll see it

Polly did look but all she saw was her own face in the little mirror of
the fan which Tom held up and peeped over with a laugh in his eyes

Do I look happy Im glad of that And Polly surveyed herself with
care

Both young men thought it was girlish vanity and smiled at its naive
display but Polly was looking for something deeper than beauty and was
glad not to find it

Rather a pleasant little prospect hey Polly

My bonnet is straight and thats all I care about Did you ever see a
picture of Beau Brummel asked Polly quickly

No

Well there he is modernized And turning the fan she showed him
himself

Any more portraits in your gallery asked Sydney as if he liked to
share all the nonsense going

One more

What do you call it

The portrait of a gentleman And the little glass reflected a
gratified face for the space of two seconds

Thank you Im glad I dont disgrace my name said Sydney looking
down into the merry blue eyes that thanked him silently for many of the
small kindnesses that women never can forget

Very good Polly you are getting on fast whispered Tom patting his
yellow kids approvingly

Be quiet Dear me how warm it is And Polly gave him a frown that
delighted his soul

Come out and have an ice we shall have time

Fan is so absorbed I could nt think of disturbing her said Polly
fancying that her friend was enjoying the evening as much as she was a
great mistake by the way for Fan was acting for effect and though she
longed to turn and join them would nt do it unless a certain person
showed signs of missing her He did nt and Fanny chatted on raging
inwardly over her disappointment and wondering how Polly could be so
gay and selfish

It was delicious to see the little airs Polly put on for she felt as if
she were somebody else and acting a part She leaned back as if quite
oppressed by the heat permitted Sydney to fan her and paid him for
the service by giving him a flower from her bouquet proceedings which
amused Tom immensely even while it piqued him a little to be treated
like an old friend who did nt count

Go in and win Polly Ill give you my blessing he whispered as the
curtain rose again

Its only part of the fun so dont you laugh you disrespectful boy
she whispered back in a tone never used toward Sydney

Tom did nt quite like the different way in which she treated them and
the word boy disturbed his dignity for he was almost twentyone and
Polly ought to treat him with more respect Sydney at the same moment
was wishing he was in Toms place young comely and such a familiar
friend that Polly would scold and lecture him in the delightful way she
did Tom while Polly forgot them both when the music began and left them
ample time to look at her and think about themselves

While they waited to get out when all was over Polly heard Fan whisper
to Tom What do you think Trix will say to this

What do you mean

Why the way youve been going on tonight

Dont know and dont care its only Polly

Thats the very thing She cant bear P

Well I can and I dont see why I should nt enjoy myself as well as
Trix

Youll get to enjoying yourself too much if you are nt careful Polly
s waked up

Im glad of it and sos Syd

I only spoke for your good

Dont trouble yourself about me I get lecturing enough in another
quarter and cant stand any more Come Polly

She took the arm he offered her but her heart was sore and angry
for that phrase Its only Polly hurt her sadly As if I was nt
anybody had nt any feelings and was only made to amuse or work for
people Fan and Tom are both mistaken and Ill show them that Polly is
awake she thought indignantly Why should nt I enjoy myself as well
as the rest Besides its only Tom she added with a bitter smile as
she thought of Trix

Are you tired Polly asked Tom bending down to look into her face

Yes of being nobody

Ah but you aint nobody youre Polly and you could nt better that
if you tried ever so hard said Tom warmly for he really was fond of
Polly and felt uncommonly so just then

Im glad you think so anyway Its so pleasant to be liked And she
looked up with her face quite bright again

I always did like you dont you know ever since that first visit

But you teased me shamefully for all that

So I did but I dont now

Polly did not answer and Tom asked with more anxiety than the occasion
required Do I Polly

Not in the same way Tom she answered in a tone that did nt sound
quite natural

Well I never will again

Yes you will you cant help it And Pollys eye glanced at Sydney
who was in front with Fan

Tom laughed and drew Polly closer as the crowd pressed saying with
mock tenderness Did nt she like to be chaffed about her sweethearts
Well she shant be if I can help it Poor dear did she get her little
bonnet knocked into a cocked hat and her little temper riled at the same
time

Polly could nt help laughing and in spite of the crush enjoyed the
slow journey from seat to carriage for Tom took such excellent care of
her she was rather sorry when it was over

They had a merry little supper after they got home and Polly gave them
a burlesque opera that convulsed her hearers for her spirits rose again
and she was determined to get the last drop of fun before she went back
to her humdrum life again

Ive had a regularly splendid time and thank you ever so much she
said when the goodnights were being exchanged

So have I Lets go and do it again tomorrow said Tom holding the
hand from which he had helped to pull a refractory glove

Not for a long while please Too much pleasure would soon spoil me
answered Polly shaking her head

I dont believe it Goodnightsweet Mistress Milton as Syd called
you Sleep like an angel and dont dream of I forgot no teasing
allowed And Tom took himself off with a theatrical farewell

Now its all over and done with thought Polly as she fell asleep
after a long vigil But it was not and Pollys fun cost more than the
price of gloves and bonnet for having nibbled at forbidden fruit she
had to pay the penalty She only meant to have a good time and there
was no harm in that but unfortunately she yielded to the various small
temptations that beset pretty young girls and did more mischief to
others than to herself Fannys friendship grew cooler after that night
Tom kept wishing Trix was half as satisfactory as Polly and Mr Sydney
began to build castles that had no foundation




CHAPTER XIII THE SUNNY SIDE


IVE won the wager Tom

Did nt know there was one

Dont you remember you said Polly would be tired of her teaching and
give it up in three months and I said she would nt

Well is nt she

Not a bit of it I thought she was at one time and expected every day
to have her come in with a long face and say she could nt stand it
But somehow lately she is always bright and happy seems to like her
work and dont have the tired worried look she used to at first The
three months are out so pay up Tommy

All right what will you have

You may make it gloves I always need them and papa looks sober when I
want money

There was a minutes pause as Fan returned to her practising and Tom
relapsed into the reverie he was enjoying seated astride of a chair
with his chin on his folded arms

Seems to me Polly dont come here as often as she used to he said
presently

No she seems to be very busy got some new friends I believe old
ladies sewinggirls and things of that sort I miss her but know she
ll get tired of being goody and will come back to me before long

Dont be too sure of that maam Something in Toms tone made Fan
turn round and ask What do you mean

Well it strikes me that Sydney is one of Pollys new friends Have nt
you observed that she is uncommonly jolly and dont that sort of thing
account for it

Nonsense said Fanny sharply

Hope it is coolly returned Tom

What put it into your head demanded Fanny twirling round again so
that her face was hidden

Oh well I keep meeting Syd and Polly circulating in the same
directions she looks as if she had found something uncommonly nice and
he looks as if all creation was getting Pollyfied pretty rapidly Wonder
you have nt observed it

I have

It was Toms turn to look surprised now for Fannys voice sounded
strange to him He looked at her steadily for a minute but saw only a
rosy ear and a bent head A cloud passed over his face and he leaned
his chin on his arm again with a despondent whistle as he said to
himself Poor Fan Both of us in a scrape at once

Dont you think it would be a good thing asked Fanny after playing a
bar or two very badly

Yes for Syd

Not for Polly Why hes rich and clever and better than most of you
goodfornothing fellows What can the girl expect

Cant say but I dont fancy the match myself

Dont be a dog in the manger Tom Bless your little heart I only take
a brotherly sort of interest in Polly Shes a capital girl and she
ought to marry a missionary or one of your reformer fellows and be
a shining light of some sort I dont think setting up for a fine lady
would suit her

I think it would and I hope shell have the chance said Fanny
evidently making an effort to speak kindly

Good for you Fan and Tom gave an emphatic nod as if her words meant
more than she suspected Mind you he added I dont know anything
and only fancied there might be some little flirtation going on But I
dare say its nothing

Time will show Then Fan began to sing and Toms horse came so he
departed with the very unusual demonstration of a gentle pat on the
head as he said kindly Thats right my dear keep jolly It was
nt an elegant way of expressing sympathy but it was hearty and
Fan thanked him for it though she only said Dont break your neck
Tommy

When he was gone Fans song ended as suddenly as it began and she sat
thinking with varying expressions of doubt and trouble passing rapidly
across her face

Well I cant do anything but wait she said at last slamming the
musicbook together with a desperate look Yes I can she added a
minute after its Pollys holiday I can go and see her and if there
is anything in it I shall find it out

Fanny dropped her face into her hands with a little shiver as she said
that then got up looking as pale and resolute as if going to meet some
dreadful doom and putting on her things went away to Pollys as fast
as her dignity would allow

Saturday morning was Pollys clearingup day and Fan found her with a
handkerchief tied over her head and a big apron on just putting the
last touches to the tidy little room which was as fresh and bright as
water air and a pair of hands could make it

All ready for company Ill just whisk off my regimentals and Polly
the maid becomes Polly the missis It was lovely of you to come early
take off your things Another new bonnet you extravagant wretch How is
your mother and Maudie Its a nice day and well have a walk wont
we

By the time Pollys welcome was uttered she had got Fan on the little
sofa beside her and was smiling at her in such an infectious manner
that Fan could nt help smiling back

I came to see what you have been doing with yourself lately You dont
come and report and I got anxious about you said Fanny looking into
the clear eyes before her

Ive been so busy and I knew you would nt care to hear about my
doings for they are nt the sort you like answered Polly

Your lessons did nt use to take up all your time Its my private
opinion that you are taking as well as giving lessons miss said Fan
putting on a playfully stern air to hide her real anxiety

Yes I am answered Polly soberly

In what Love

A quick color came to Pollys cheeks as she laughed and said looking
away No friendship and good works

Oh indeed May I ask who is your teacher

Ive more than one but Miss Mills is head teacher

She instructs in good works who gives the friendship lessons

Such pleasant girls I wish you knew them Fan So clever and
energetic and kind and happy it always does me good to see them
cried Polly with a face full of enthusiasm

Is that all And Fan gave her a curious look of mingled disappointment
and relief

There I told you my doings would not interest you and they dont
they sound flat and prosy after your brilliant adventures Lets change
the subject said Polly looking relieved herself

Dear me which of our sweethearts sends us dainty bouquets of violets
so early in the morning asked Fanny suddenly spying the purple
cluster in a graceful little vase on the piano

He sends me one every week he knows I love them so and Pollys eyes
turned that way full of pride and pleasure

Id no idea he was so devoted said Fanny stooping to smell the
flowers and at the same time read a card that lay near them

You need nt plague me about it now you know it I never speak of
our fondness for one another because such things seem silly to other
people Will is nt all that Jimmy was to me but he tries to be and I
love him dearly for it

Will Fannys voice quite startled Polly it was so sharp and sudden
and her face grew red and pale all in a minute as she upset the little
vase with the start she gave

Yes of course who did you think I meant asked Polly sopping up the
water before it damaged her piano

Never mind I thought you might be having a quiet little flirtation
with somebody I feel responsible you know because I told your mother
Id look after you The flowers are all right My head aches so I
hardly know what Im doing this morning

Fanny spoke fast and laughed uncomfortably as she went back to the
sofa wondering if Polly had told her a lie Polly seemed to guess at
her thoughts as she saw the card and turning toward her she held it
up saying with a conscious look in her eyes You thought Mr Sydney
sent them Well you are mistaken and the next time you want to know
anything please ask straight out I like it better than talking at
cross purposes

Now my dear dont be angry I was only teasing you in fun Tom took
it into his foolish head that something was going on and I felt a
natural interest you know

Tom What does he know or care about my affairs demanded Polly

He met you two in the street pretty often and being in a sentimental
mood himself got up a romance for you and Sydney

Im much obliged to him for his interest but its quite wasted
thank you

Fans next proceeding gave her friend another surprise for being
rather ashamed of herself very much relieved and quite at a loss what
to say she took refuge in an hysterical fit of tears which changed
Pollys anger into tenderness at once

Is that the trouble she has been hiding all winter Poor dear I wish
Id known it sooner thought Polly as she tried to soothe her with
comfortable pats sniffs of cologne and sympathizing remarks upon the
subject of headache carefully ignoring that other feminine affliction
the heartache

There I feel better Ive been needing a good cry for some time and
now I shall be all right Never mind it Polly Im nervous and tired
Ive danced too much lately and dyspepsia makes me blue and Fanny
wiped her eyes and laughed

Of course it does you need rest and petting and here Ive been
scolding you when I ought to have been extra kind Now tell me what I
can do for you said Polly with a remorseful face

Talk to me and tell me all about yourself You dont seem to have as
many worries as other people Whats the secret Polly And Fan looked
up with wet eyes and a wistful face at Polly who was putting little
dabs of cologne all over her head

Well said Polly slowly I just try to look on the bright side of
things that helps one amazingly Why youve no idea how much goodness
and sunshine you can get out of the most unpromising things if you make
the best of them

I dont know how said Fan despondently

You can learn I did I used to croak and fret dreadfully and get so
unhappy I was nt fit for anything I do it still more than I ought
but I try not to and it gets easier I find Get atop of your
troubles and then they are half cured Miss Mills says

Everything is so contrary and provoking said Fanny petulantly

Now what in the world have you to fret about asked Polly rather
anxiously

Quantities of things began Fan and then stopped for somehow she
felt ashamed to own that she was afflicted because she could nt have
a new set of furs go to Paris in the spring and make Mr Sydney love
her She hunted up something more presentable and said in a despairing
tone Well mother is very poorly Tom and Trix quarrel all the time
Maud gets more and more wilful every day and papa is worried about his
affairs

A sad state of things but nothing very desperate Cant you lend a
hand anywhere That might do good all round

No I have nt the talent for managing people but I see what ought to
be done

Well dont wail about it keep yourself happy if you can it will
help other people to see you cheerful

Just what Tom saidKeep jolly but dear me how can one when
everything is so stupid and tiresome

If ever a girl needed work its you cried Polly You began to be
a young lady so early that you are tired of everything at twentytwo I
wish youd go at something then youd find how much talent and energy
you really had

I know ever so many girls who are just like me sick to death of
fashionable life but dont know what to take in its place Id like to
travel but papa says he cant afford it so I can only drag about and
get on as I may

I pity you rich girls so much you have so many opportunities and
dont seem to know how to use them I suppose I should do just the same
in your place but it seems now as if I could be very happy and useful
with plenty of money

You are that without it There I wont croak any more Let us go and
take a good walk and dont you tell any one how I came and cried like a
baby

Never said Polly putting on her bonnet

I ought to go and make calls said Fanny but I dont feel now as if
I ever wanted to see any of the girls again Dreadful state of mind is
nt it

Suppose you come and see some of my friends instead They are not fine
or ceremonious but lively odd and pleasant Come it will amuse you

I will cried Fanny whose spirits seemed improved by the shower
Nice little old lady is nt she added Fan as she caught sight of
Miss Mills on their way out sitting at a table piled with work and
sewing away with an energy that made the gray curls vibrate

Saint Mehitable I call her Now there is a rich woman who knew how to
get happiness out of her money said Polly as they walked away She
was poor till she was nearly fifty then a comfortable fortune was left
her and she knew just how to use it That house was given her but
instead of living in it all alone she filled it with poor gentlefolks
who needed neat respectable homes but could nt get anything
comfortable for their little money Im one of them and I know the
worth of what she does for me Two old widow ladies live below me
several students overhead poor Mrs Kean and her lame boy have the back
parlor and Jenny the little bedroom next Miss Mills Each pays what
they can thats independent and makes us feel better but that dear
woman does a thousand things that money cant pay for and we feel her
influence all through the house Id rather be married and have a home
of my own but next to that I should like to be an old maid like Miss
Mills

Pollys sober face and emphatic tone made Fanny laugh and at the cheery
sound a young girl pushing a babycarriage looked round and smiled

What lovely eyes whispered Fanny

Yes thats little Jane returned Polly adding when she had passed
with a nod and a friendly Dont get tired Jenny we help one another
at our house and every fine morning Jenny takes Johnny Kean out when
she goes for her own walk That gives his mother time to rest does both
the children good and keeps things neighborly Miss Mills suggested it
and Jenny is so glad to do anything for anybody its a pleasure to let
her

Ive heard of Miss Mills before But I should think she would get
tired to death sitting there making hoods and petticoats day after
day said Fanny after thinking over Jennys story for a few minutes
for seeing the girl seemed to bring it nearer and make it more real to
her

But she dont sit there all the time People come to her with their
troubles and she goes to them with all sorts of help from soap and
soup to shrouds for the dead and comfort for the living I go with her
sometimes and it is more exciting than any play to see and hear the
lives and stories of the poor

How can you bear the dreadful sights and sounds the bad air and the
poverty that cant be cured

But it is nt all dreadful There are good and lovely things among
them if one only has eyes to see them It makes me grateful and
contented shows me how rich I am and keeps me ready to do all I can
for these poor souls

My good Polly and Fanny gave her friends arm an affectionate squeeze
wondering if it was this alone that had worked the change in Polly

You have seen two of my new friends Miss Mills and Jenny now Ill
show you two more said Polly presently as they reached a door and
she led the way up several flights of public stairs Rebecca Jeffrey
is a regularly splendid girl full of talent she wont let us call it
genius she will be famous some day I know she is so modest and yet
so intent on her work Lizzie Small is an engraver and designs the most
delightful little pictures Becky and she live together and take care
of one another in true Damon and Pythias style This studio is their
home they work eat sleep and live here going halves in everything
They are all alone in the world but as happy and independent as birds
real friends whom nothing will part

Let a lover come between them and their friendship wont last long
said Fanny

I think it will Take a look at them and youll change your mind
answered Polly tapping at a door on which two modest cards were
tacked

Come in said a voice and obeying Fanny found herself in a large
queerly furnished room lighted from above and occupied by two girls
One stood before a great clay figure in a corner This one was tall
with a strong face keen eyes short curly hair and a fine head
Fanny was struck at once by this face and figure though the one was
not handsome and the other half hidden by a great pinafore covered with
clay At a table where the light was clearest sat a fraillooking girl
with a thin face big eyes and pale hair a dreamy absorbed little
person who bent over a block skillfully wielding her tools

Becky and Bess how do you do This is my friend Fanny Shaw We are
out on a rampage so go on with your work and let us lazy ones look on
and admire

As Polly spoke both girls looked up and nodded smilingly Bess gave
Fan the one easychair Becky took an artistic survey of the newcomer
with eyes that seemed to see everything then each went on with her
work and all began to talk

You are just what I want Polly Pull up your sleeve and give me an
arm while you sit the muscles here are nt right and youve got just
what I want said Becky slapping the round arm of the statue at which
Fan was gazing with awe

How do you get on asked Polly throwing off her cloak and rolling up
her sleeves as if going to washing

Slowly The idea is working itself clear and I follow as fast as my
hands can Is the face better do you think said Becky taking off a
wet cloth and showing the head of the statue

How beautiful it is cried Fanny staring at it with increased
respect

What does it mean to you asked Rebecca turning to her with a sudden
shine in her keen eyes

I dont know whether it is meant for a saint or a muse a goddess or a
fate but to me it is only a beautiful woman bigger lovelier and more
imposing than any woman I ever saw answered Fanny slowly trying to
express the impression the statue made upon her

Rebecca smiled brightly and Bess looked round to nod approvingly but
Polly clapped her hands and said Well done Fan I did nt think you
d get the idea so well but you have and Im proud of your insight
Now Ill tell you for Becky will let me since you have paid her the
compliment of understanding her work Some time ago we got into a famous
talk about what women should be and Becky said shed show us her idea
of the coming woman There she is as you say bigger lovelier and
more imposing than any we see nowadays and at the same time she is
a true woman See what a fine forehead yet the mouth is both firm
and tender as if it could say strong wise things as well as teach
children and kiss babies We could nt decide what to put in the hands
as the most appropriate symbol What do you say

Give her a sceptre she would make a fine queen answered Fanny

No we have had enough of that women have been called queens a long
time but the kingdom given them is nt worth ruling answered Rebecca

I dont think it is nowadays said Fanny with a tired sort of sigh

Put a mans hand in hers to help her along then said Polly whose
happy fortune it had been to find friends and helpers in father and
brothers

No my woman is to stand alone and help herself said Rebecca
decidedly

Shes to be strongminded is she and Fannys lip curled a little as
she uttered the misused words

Yes strongminded stronghearted strongsouled and strongbodied
that is why I made her larger than the miserable pinchedup woman of
our day Strength and beauty must go together Dont you think these
broad shoulders can bear burdens without breaking down these hands work
well these eyes see clearly and these lips do something besides simper
and gossip

Fanny was silent but a voice from Besss corner said Put a child in
her arms Becky

Not that even for she is to be something more than a nurse

Give her a ballotbox cried a new voice and turning round they saw
an oddlooking woman perched on a sofa behind them

Thank you for the suggestion Kate Ill put that with the other
symbols at her feet for Im going to have needle pen palette
and broom somewhere to suggest the various talents she owns and the
ballotbox will show that she has earned the right to use them How
goes it and Rebecca offered a claydaubed hand which the newcomer
cordially shook

Great news girls Anna is going to Italy cried Kate tossing up her
bonnet like a schoolboy

Oh how splendid Who takes her Has she had a fortune left her Tell
all about it exclaimed the girls gathering round the speaker

Yes it is splendid just one of the beautiful things that does
everybody heaps of good it is so generous and so deserved You know
Anna has been longing to go working and hoping for a chance and never
getting it till all of a sudden Miss Burton is inspired to invite the
girl to go with her for several years to Italy Think of the luck of
that dear soul the advantages shell have the good it will do her
and best of all the lovely way in which it comes to her Miss Burton
wants her as a friend asks nothing of her but her company and Anna
will go through fire and water for her of course Now is nt that
fine

It was good to see how heartily these girls sympathized in their
comrades good fortune Polly danced all over the room Bess and Becky
hugged one another and Kate laughed with her eyes full while even
Fanny felt a glow of pride and pleasure at the kind act

Who is that she whispered to Polly who had subsided into a corner

Why it Is Kate King the authoress Bless me how rude not to
introduce you Here my King is an admirer of yours Fanny Shaw and
my well beloved friend cried Polly presenting Fan who regarded the
shabby young woman with as much respect as if she had been arrayed in
velvet and ermine for Kate had written a successful book by accident
and happened to be the fashion just then

Its time for lunch girls and I brought mine along with me its
so much jollier to eat in sisterhood Lets club together and have a
revel said Kate producing a bag of oranges and several big plummy
buns

Weve got sardines crackers and cheese said Bess clearing off a
table with all speed

Wait a bit and Ill add my share cried Polly and catching up her
cloak she ran off to the grocery store near by

Youll be shocked at our performances Miss Shaw but you can call
it a picnic and never tell what dreadful things you saw us do said
Rebecca polishing a paint knife by rubbing it up and down in a pot of
ivy while Kate spread forth the feast in several odd plates and a flat
shell or two

Let us have coffee to finish off with put on the pot Bess and skim
the milk added Becky as she produced cups mugs and a queer little
vase to supply drinking vessels for the party

Heres nuts a pot of jam and some cake Fan likes sweet things
and we want to be elegant when we have company said Polly flying in
again and depositing her share on the table

Now then fall to ladies and help yourselves Never mind if the
china dont hold out take the sardines by their little tails and wipe
your fingers on my brownpaper napkins said Kate setting the example
with such a relish that the others followed it in a gale of merriment

Fanny had been to many elegant lunches but never enjoyed one more than
that droll picnic in the studio for there was a freedom about it that
was charming an artistic flavor to everything and such a spirit of
goodwill and gayety that she felt at home at once As they ate the
others talked and she listened finding it as interesting as any romance
to hear these young women discuss their plans ambitions successes and
defeats It was a new world to her and they seemed a different race
of creatures from the girls whose lives were spent in dress gossip
pleasure or ennui They were girls still full of spirits fun and
youth but below the lightheartedness each cherished a purpose
which seemed to ennoble her womanhood to give her a certain power
a sustaining satisfaction a daily stimulus that led her on to daily
effort and in time to some success in circumstance or character which
was worth all the patience hope and labor of her life

Fanny was just then in the mood to feel the beauty of this for
the sincerest emotion she had ever known was beginning to make her
dissatisfied with herself and the aimless life she led Men must
respect such girls as these she thought yes and love them too for
in spite of their independence they are womanly I wish I had a talent
to live for if it would do as much for me as it does for them It
is this sort of thing that is improving Polly that makes her society
interesting to Sydney and herself so dear to every one Money cant buy
these things for me and I want them very much

As these thoughts were passing through her mind Fanny was hearing all
sorts of topics discussed with feminine enthusiasm and frankness Art
morals politics society books religion housekeeping dress and
economy for the minds and tongues roved from subject to subject with
youthful rapidity and seemed to get something from the dryest and the
dullest

How does the new book come on asked Polly sucking her orange in
public with a composure which would have scandalized the good ladies of
Cranford

Better than it deserves My children beware of popularity it is a
delusion and a snare it puffeth up the heart of man and especially
of woman it blindeth the eyes to faults it exalteth unduly the humble
powers of the victim it is apt to be capricious and just as one gets
to liking the taste of this intoxicating draught it suddenly faileth
and one is left gasping like a fish out of water and Kate emphasized
her speech by spearing a sardine with a penknife and eating it with a
groan

It wont hurt you much I guess you have worked and waited so long
a large dose will do you good said Rebecca giving her a generous
spoonful of jam as if eager to add as much sweetness as possible to a
life that had not been an easy one

When are you and Becky going to dissolve partnership asked Polly
eager for news of all

Never George knows he cant have one without the other and has not
suggested such a thing as parting us There is always room in my house
for Becky and she lets me do as she would if she was in my place
answered Bess with a look which her friend answered by a smile

The lover wont separate this pair of friends you see whispered
Polly to Fan Bess is to be married in the spring and Becky is to live
with her

By the way Polly Ive got some tickets for you People are always
sending me such things and as I dont care for them Im glad to
make them over to you young and giddy infants There are passes for
the statuary exhibition Becky shall have those here are the concert
tickets for you my musical girl and that is for a course of lectures
on literature which Ill keep for myself

As Kate dealt out the colored cards to the grateful girls Fanny took a
good look at her wondering if the time would ever come when women could
earn a little money and success without paying such a heavy price for
them for Kate looked sick tired and too early old Then her eye went
to the unfinished statue and she said impulsively I hope youll put
that in marble and show us what we ought to be

I wish I could And an intense desire shone in Rebeccas face as she
saw her faulty work and felt how fair her model was

For a minute the five young women sat silent looking up at the
beautiful strong figure before them each longing to see it done and
each unconscious that she was helping by her individual effort and
experience to bring the day when their noblest ideal of womanhood
should be embodied in flesh and blood not clay

The city bells rung one and Polly started up

I must go for I promised a neighbor of mine a lesson at two

I thought this was a holiday said Fanny

So it is but this is a little labor of love and does nt spoil the
day at all The child has talent loves music and needs help I cant
give her money but I can teach her so I do and she is the most
promising pupil I have Help one another is part of the religion of our
sisterhood Fan

I must put you in a story Polly I want a heroine and you will do
said Kate

Me why there never was such a humdrum unromantic thing as I am
cried Polly amazed

Ive booked you nevertheless so in you go but you may add as much
romance as you like its time you did

Im ready for it when it comes but it cant be forced you know
and Polly blushed and smiled as if some little spice of that delightful
thing had stolen into her life for all its prosaic seeming

Fanny was amused to see that the girls did not kiss at parting but
shook hands in a quiet friendly fashion looking at one another with
eyes that said more than the most gushing words

I like your friends very much Polly I was afraid I should find them
mannish and rough or sentimental and conceited But they are simple
sensible creatures full of talent and all sorts of fine things I
admire and respect them and want to go again if I may

Oh Fan I am so glad I hoped youd like them I knew theyd do you
good and Ill take you any time for you stood the test better than
I expected Becky asked me to bring you again and she seldom does that
for fashionable young ladies let me tell you

I want to be ever so much better and I think you and they might show
me how said Fanny with a traitorous tremble in her voice

Well show you the sunny side of poverty and work and that is a
useful lesson for any one Miss Mills says answered Polly hoping that
Fan would learn how much the poor can teach the rich and what helpful
friends girls may be to one another




CHAPTER XIV NIPPED IN THE BUD


ON the evening of Fans visit Polly sat down before her fire with a
resolute and thoughtful aspect She pulled her hair down turned her
skirt back put her feet on the fender and took Puttel into her lap
all of which arrangements signified that something very important had
got to be thought over and settled Polly did not soliloquize aloud
as heroines on the stage and in books have a way of doing but the
conversation she held with herself was very much like this Im afraid
there is something in it Ive tried to think its nothing but vanity
or imagination yet I cant help seeing a difference and feeling as if
I ought not to pretend that I dont I know its considered proper for
girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how
much mischief is done But I dont think its doing as wed be done
by and it seems a great deal more honest to show a man that you dont
love him before he has entirely lost his heart The girls laughed at me
when I said so and they declared that it would be a very improper thing
to do but Ive observed that they dont hesitate to snubineligible
parties as they call poor very young or unpopular men Its all
right then but when a nice person comes its part of the fun to let
him go on to the very end whether the girls care for him or not The
more proposals the more credit Fan says Trix always asks when she
comes home after the summer excursions How many birds have you
bagged as if men were partridges What wicked creatures we are some
of us at least I wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us
Mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays but
some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would
manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness Im afraid Ive
got a spice of it and if I had the chance should be as bad as any of
them Ive tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of
that nights fun

Here Polly leaned back and looked up at the little mirror over the
chimneypiece which was hung so that it reflected the faces of those
about the fire In it Polly saw a pair of telltale eyes looking out from
a tangle of bright brown hair cheeks that flushed and dimpled suddenly
as the fresh mouth smiled with an expression of conscious power half
proud half ashamed and as pretty to see as the coquettish gesture with
which she smoothed back her curls and flourished a white hand For
a minute she regarded the pleasant picture while visions of girlish
romances and triumphs danced through her head then she shook her hair
all over her face and pushed her chair out of range of the mirror
saying with a droll mixture of selfreproach and selfapproval in her
tone Oh Puttel Puttel what a fool I am

Puss appeared to endorse the sentiment by a loud purr and a graceful
wave of her tail and Polly returned to the subject from which these
little vanities had beguiled her

Just suppose it is true that he does ask me and I say yes What a
stir it would make and what fun it would be to see the faces of the
girls when it came out They all think a great deal of him because he is
so hard to please and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered
if he liked them whether they chose to marry him or not Trix has tried
for years to fascinate him and he cant bear her and Im so glad
What a spiteful thing I am Well I cant help it she does aggravate me
so And Polly gave the cat such a tweak of the ear that Puttel bounced
out of her lap in high dudgeon

It dont do to think of her and I wont said Polly to herself
setting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming What
an easy life I should have plenty of money quantities of friends
all sorts of pleasures and no work no poverty no cold shoulders or
patched boots I could do so much for all at home how I should enjoy
that And Polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her
fancy painted It was a very bright picture but something seemed
amiss with it for presently she sighed and shook her head thinking
sorrowfully Ah but I dont love him and Im afraid I never can as
I ought Hes very good and generous and wise and would be kind
I know but somehow I cant imagine spending my life with him Im
so afraid I should get tired of him and then what should I do Polly
Sydney dont sound well and Mrs Arthur Sydney dont seem to fit me a
bit Wonder how it would seem to call him Arthur And Polly said it
under her breath with a look over her shoulder to be sure no one heard
it Its a pretty name but rather too fine and I should nt dare
to say Syd as his sister does I like short plain homelike names
such as Will Ned or Tom No no I can never care for him and its
no use to try The exclamation broke from Polly as if a sudden
trouble had seized her and laying her head down on her knees she sat
motionless for many minutes

When she looked up her face wore an expression which no one had ever
seen on it before a look of mingled pain and patience as if some loss
had come to her and left the bitterness of regret behind

I wont think of myself or try to mend one mistake by making another
she said with a heavy sigh Ill do what I can for Fan and not stand
between her and a chance of happiness Let me see how can I begin I
wont walk with him any more Ill dodge and go roundabout ways so
that we cant meet I never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence
of his always happening home to dinner just as I go to give the Roths
their lesson The fact is I like to meet him I am glad to be seen with
him and put on airs I dare say like a vain goose as I am Well I
wont do it any more and that will spare Fan one affliction Poor dear
how I must have worried her all this time and never guessed it She has
nt been quite as kind as ever but when she got sharp I fancied it was
dyspepsia Oh me I wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as
this

Here puss showed an amiable desire to forgive and forget and Polly
took her up saying aloud Puttel when missis abuses you play its
dyspepsia and dont bear malice because its a very trying disease
my dear

Then going back to her thoughts she rambled on again If he does
nt take that hint I will give him a stronger one for I will not have
matters come to a crisis though I cant deny that my wicked vanity
strongly tempts me to try andbag a bird just for the excitement and
credit of the thing Polly Im ashamed of you What would your blessed
mother say to hear such expressions from you Id write and tell her
all the worry only it would nt do any good and would only trouble
her Ive no right to tell Fans secrets and Im ashamed to tell
mine No Ill leave mother in peace and fight it out alone I do
think Fan would suit him excellently by and by He has known her all her
life and has a good influence over her Love would do so much toward
making her what she might be its a shame to have the chance lost just
because he happens to see me I should think shed hate me but Ill
show her that she need nt and do all I can to help her for she has
been so good to me nothing shall ever make me forget that It is a
delicate and dangerous task but I guess I can manage it at any rate
Ill try and have nothing to reproach myself with if things do go
contrary

What Polly thought of as she lay back in her chair with her eyes shut
and a hopeless look on her face is none of our business though we
might feel a wish to know what caused a tear to gather slowly from time
to time under her lashes and roll down on Puttels Quakercolored coat
Was it regret for the conquest she relinquished was it sympathy for her
friend or was it an uncontrollable overflow of feeling as she read some
sad or tender passage of the little romance which she kept hidden away
in her own heart

On Monday Polly began the delicate and dangerous task Instead
of going to her pupils by way of the park and the pleasant streets
adjoining she took a roundabout route through back streets and thus
escaped Mr Sydney who as usual came home to dinner very early that
day and looked disappointed because he nowhere saw the bright face
in the modest bonnet Polly kept this up for a week and by carefully
avoiding the Shaws house during calling hours she saw nothing of
Mr Sydney who of course did nt visit her at Miss Mills Minnie
happened to be poorly that week and took no lesson so Uncle Syd was
deprived of his last hope and looked as if his allowance of sunshine
had been suddenly cut off

Now as Polly was by no means a perfect creature I am free to confess
that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when
the first excitement of the dodging reform had subsided she missed the
pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance
into her dull hardworking days She liked Mr Sydney very much for
he had always been kind and friendly since the early times when he had
treated the little girl with a courtesy which the young woman gratefully
remembered I dont think it was his wealth accomplishments or
position that most attracted Polly though these doubtless possessed
a greater influence than she suspected It was that indescribable
something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been
blessed with wise and good mothers This had an especial charm to Polly
for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to
every one With most girls he was very like the other young men of his
set except perhaps in a certain grace of manner which was as natural to
him as his respect for all womankind But with Fanny and Polly he showed
the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women
than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom

Polly had seen a good deal of him during her visits at the Shaws where
he was intimate owing to the friendship between Madam and his mother
but she had never thought of him as a possible lover for either Fanny
or herself because he was six or eight years older than they and still
sometimes assumed the part of a venerable mentor as in the early days
Lately this had changed especially towards Polly and it flattered her
more than she would confess even to herself She knew he admired her one
talent respected her independence and enjoyed her society but when
something warmer and more flattering than admiration respect or
pleasure crept into his manner she could not help seeing that one of
the good gifts of this life was daily coming more and more within her
reach and began to ask herself if she could honestly receive the gift
and reward the giver

At first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are
so contrary that they wont be obedient to reason will or even
gratitude Polly felt a very cordial friendship for Mr Sydney but not
one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be
truly paid Then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to
accept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family and forget
herself But this false idea of selfsacrifice did not satisfy for she
was not a fashionable girl trained to believe that her first duty was
to make a good match and never mind the consequences though they
rendered her miserable for life Pollys creed was very simple If
I dont love him I ought not to marry him especially when I do love
somebody else though everything is against me If she had read as
many French novels as some young ladies she might have considered it
interesting to marry under the circumstances and suffer a secret anguish
to make her a romantic victim But Pollys education had been neglected
and after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do
in such cases thought she would wait and see

The discovery of Fannys secret seemed to show her something to do for
if the wait and see decision was making her friend unhappy it must be
changed as soon as possible This finished Pollys indecision and
after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant
temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl
with a spice of the old Eve in her composition So day after day she
trudged through the dull back streets longing for the sunny park the
face that always brightened when it saw her coming and most of all the
chance of meeting well it was nt Trix

When Saturday came Polly started as usual for a visit to Becky and
Bess but could nt resist stopping at the Shaws to leave a little
parcel for Fan though it was calling time As she stepped in meaning
to run up for a word if Fanny should chance to be alone two hats on the
hall table arrested her

Who is here Katy

Only Mr Sydney and Master Tom Wont you stop a bit Miss Polly

Not this morning Im rather in a hurry And away went Polly as if a
dozen eager pupils were clamoring for her presence But as the door shut
behind her she felt so left out in the cold that her eyes filled
and when Nep Toms great Newfoundland came blundering after her she
stopped and hugged his shaggy head saying softly as she looked into
the brown benevolent eyes full of almost human sympathy Now go
back old dear you must nt follow me Oh Nep its so hard to put
love away when you want it very much and it is nt right to take it
A foolish little speech to make to a dog but you see Polly was only a
tenderhearted girl trying to do her duty

Since he is safe with Fanny I may venture to walk where I like It
s such a lovely day all the babies will be out and it always does me
good to see them thought Polly turning into the wide sunny street
where West Enddom promenaded at that hour

The babies were out in full force looking as gay and delicate and sweet
as the snowdrops hyacinths and daffodils on the banks whence the
snow had melted But somehow the babies did nt do Polly the good she
expected though they smiled at her from their carriages and kissed
their chubby hands as she passed them for Polly had the sort of face
that babies love One tiny creature in blue plush was casting despairing
glances after a very small lord of creation who was walking away with
a toddling belle in white while a second young gentleman in gorgeous
purple gaiters was endeavoring to console the deserted damsel

Take hold of Master Charleys hand Miss Mamie and walk pretty like
Willy and Flossy said the maid

No no I want to do wid Willy and he wont let me Doway Tarley I
dont lite you cried little Bluebonnet casting down her ermine muff
and sobbing in a microscopic handkerchief the threadlace edging on
which could nt mitigate her woe as it might have done that of an older
sufferer

Willy likes Flossy best so stop crying and come right along you
naughty child

As poor little Dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid and
Purplegaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause Polly said to
herself with a smile and a sigh How early the old story begins

It seemed as if the spring weather had brought out all manner of tender
things beside fresh grass and the first dandelions for as she went down
the street Polly kept seeing different phases of the sweet old story
which she was trying to forget

At a street corner a blackeyed schoolboy was parting from
a rosyfaced schoolgirl whose music roll he was reluctantly
surrendering

Dont you forget now said the boy looking bashfully into the bright
eyes that danced with pleasure as the girl blushed and smiled and
answered reproachfully Why of course I shant

That little romance runs smoothly so far I hope it may to the end
said Polly heartily as she watched the lad tramp away whistling as
blithely as if his pleasurable emotions must find a vent or endanger
the buttons on the round jacket while the girl pranced on her own
doorstep as if practising for the joyful dance which she had promised
not to forget

A little farther on Polly passed a newly engaged couple whom she knew
walking arm in arm for the first time both wearing that proud yet
conscious look which is so delightful to behold upon the countenances of
these temporarily glorified beings

How happy they seem oh dear said Polly and trudged on wondering
if her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible

A glimpse of a motherlylooking lady entering a door received by a
flock of pretty children who cast themselves upon mamma and her parcels
with cries of rapture did Polly good and when a minute after she
passed a gray old couple walking placidly together in the sunshine
she felt better still and was glad to see such a happy ending to the
romance she had read all down the street

As if the mischievous little god wished to take Polly at a disadvantage
or perhaps to give her another chance just at that instant Mr Sydney
appeared at her side How he got there was never very clear to Polly
but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so
glad to see her that she had nt the heart to be stiff and cool as she
had fully intended to be when they met

Very warm is nt it he said when he had shaken hands and fallen into
step just in the old way

You seem to find it so And Polly laughed with a sudden sparkle in
her eyes She really could nt help it it was so pleasant to see him
again just when she was feeling so lonely

Have you given up teaching the Roths asked Sydney changing the
subject

No

Do you go as usual

Yes

Well its a mystery to me how you get there

As much as it is to me how you got here so suddenly

I saw you from the Shaws window and took the liberty of running after
you by the back street he said laughing

That is the way I get to the Roths answered Polly She did not mean
to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself

Its not nearly so pleasant or so short for you as the park

I know it but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try
new ones

Polly did nt say that quite naturally and Sydney gave her a quick
look as he asked Do you get tired of old friends too Miss Polly

Not often but And there she stuck for the fear of being ungrateful
or unkind made her almost hope that he would nt take the hint which she
had been carefully preparing for him

There was a dreadful little pause which Polly broke by saying abruptly
How is Fan

Dashing as ever Do you know Im rather disappointed in Fanny
for she dont seem to improve with her years said Sydney as if he
accepted the diversion and was glad of it

Ah you never see her at her best She puts on that dashing air before
people to hide her real self But I know her better and I assure you
that she does improve she tries to mend her faults though she wont
own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense
and goodness she has got

Polly spoke heartily now and Sydney looked at her as if Fannys
defender pleased him more than Fannys defence

Im very glad to hear it and willingly take your word for it
Everybody shows you their good side I think and that is why you find
the world such a pleasant place

Oh but I dont It often seems like a very hard and dismal place and
I croak over my trials like an ungrateful raven

Cant we make the trials lighter for you

The voice that put the question was so very kind that Polly dared not
look up because she knew what the eyes were silently saying

Thank you no I dont get more tribulation than is good for me I
fancy and we are apt to make mistakes when we try to dodge troubles

Or people added Sydney in a tone that made Polly color up to her
forehead

How lovely the park looks she said in great confusion

Yes its the pleasantest walk we have dont you think so asked the
artful young man laying a trap into which Polly immediately fell

Yes indeed Its always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of
the country as it were especially at this season

Oh Polly Polly what a stupid speech to make when you had just given
him to understand that you were tired of the park Not being a fool or a
coxcomb Sydney put this and that together and taking various trifles
into the account he had by this time come to the conclusion that Polly
had heard the same bits of gossip that he had which linked their names
together that she did nt like it and tried to show she did nt in
this way He was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being
both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for
Pollys sake as well as his own So when she made her last brilliant
remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while I
thought so well Im going out of town on business for several weeks
so you can enjoy yourlittle bit of country without being annoyed by
me

Annoyed Oh no cried Polly earnestly then stopped short not
knowing what to say for herself She thought she had a good deal of
the coquette in her and Ive no doubt that with time and training she
would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far
too transparent and straightforward by nature even to tell a white lie
cleverly Sydney knew this and liked her for it but he took advantage
of it nevertheless by asking suddenly Honestly now would nt you go
the old way and enjoy it as much as ever if I was nt anywhere about to
set the busybodies gossiping

Yes said Polly before she could stop herself and then could have
bitten her tongue out for being so rude Another awful pause seemed
impending but just at that moment a horseman clattered by with a smile
and a salute which caused Polly to exclaim Oh theres Tom with a
tone and a look that silenced the words hovering on Sydneys lips and
caused him to hold out his hand with a look which made Pollys heart
flutter then and ache with pity for a good while afterward though he
only said Good by Polly

He was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a
remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps
the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted
it in silence She did not know what else he had read and comforted
herself with the thought that he did not care for her very much since
he took the first rebuff so quickly

Polly did not return to her favorite walk till she learned from Minnie
that Uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly
company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after
all She sighed over the perversity of things in general and croaked a
little over her trials in particular but on the whole got over her loss
better than she expected for soon she had other sorrows beside her own
to comfort and such work does a body more good than floods of regretful
tears or hours of sentimental lamentation

She shunned Fanny for a day or two but gained nothing by it for that
young lady hearing of Sydneys sudden departure could not rest till
she discovered the cause of it and walked in upon Polly one afternoon
just when the dusk made it a propitious hour for tender confidences

What have you been doing with yourself lately asked Fanny composing
herself with her back toward the rapidly waning light

Wagging to and fro as usual Whats the news with you answered Polly
feeling that something was coming and rather glad to have it over and
done with

Nothing particular Trix treats Tom shamefully and he bears it like a
lamb I tell him to break his engagement and not be worried so but he
wont because she has been jilted once and he thinks its such a mean
thing to do

Perhaps shell jilt him

Ive no doubt she will if anything better comes along But Trix is
getting passe and I should nt wonder if she kept him to his word just
out of perversity if nothing else

Poor Tom what a fate said Polly with what was meant to be a comical
groan but it sounded so tragical that she saw it would nt pass and
hastened to hide the failure by saying with a laugh If you call Trix
passe at twentythree what shall we all be at twentyfive Utterly
done with and laid upon the shelf I feel so already for I dont get
half the attention I used to have and the other night I heard Maud and
Grace wondering why those old girlsdid nt stay at home and give them
a chance

How is Maudie

Pretty well but she worries me by her queer tastes and notions She
loves to go into the kitchen and mess she hates to study and said
right before the Vincents that she should think it would be great fun to
be a beggargirl to go round with a basket it must be so interesting
to see what youd get

Minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could
paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers

By the way when is her uncle coming back asked Fanny who could nt
wait any longer and joyfully seized the opening Polly made for her

Im sure I dont know

Nor care I suppose you hardhearted thing

Why Fan what do you mean

Im not blind my dear neither is Tom and when a young gentleman
cuts a call abruptly short and races after a young lady and is seen
holding her hand at the quietest corner of the park and then goes
travelling all of a sudden we know what it means if you dont

Who got up that nice idea I should like to know demanded Polly as
Fanny stopped for breath

Now dont be affected Polly but just tell me like a dear has nt he
proposed

No he has nt

Dont you think he means to

I dont think hell ever say a word to me

Well I am surprised And Fanny drew a long breath as if a load was
off her mind Then she added in a changed tone But dont you love him
Polly

No

Truly

Truly Fan

Neither spoke for a minute but the heart of one of them beat joyfully
and the dusk hid a very happy face

Dont you think he cared for you dear asked Fanny presently I
dont mean to be prying but I really thought he did

Thats not for me to say but if it is so its only a passing fancy
and hell soon get over it

Do tell me all about it Im so interested and I know something has
happened I hear it in your voice for I cant see your face

Do you remember the talk we once had after reading one of Miss
Edgeworths stories about not letting ones lovers come to a declaration
if one did nt love them

Yes

And you girls said it was nt proper and I said it was honest anyway
Well I always meant to try it if I got a chance and I have Mind you
I dont say Mr Sydney loved me for he never said so and never will
now but I did fancy he rather liked me and might do more if I did nt
show him that it was of no use

And you did cried Fanny much excited

I just gave him a hint and he took it He meant to go away before that
so dont think his heart is broken or mind what silly tattlers say
I did nt like his meeting me so much and told him so by going another
way He understood and being a gentleman made no fuss I dare say
he thought I was a vain goose and laughed at me for my pains like
Churchill in Helen

No he would nt Hed like it and respect you for doing it But
Polly it would have been a grand thing for you

I cant sell myself for an establishment

Mercy What an idea

Well thats the plain English of half your fashionable matches I
modd you know and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach
music all my days

Ah but you wont You were made for a nice happy home of your own
and I hope youll get it Polly dear said Fanny warmly feeling so
grateful to Polly that she found it hard not to pour out all her secret
at once

I hope I may but I doubt it answered Polly in a tone that made Fanny
wonder if she too knew what heartache meant

Something troubles you Polly what is it Confide in me as I do in
you said Fanny tenderly for all the coldness she had tried to hide
from Polly had melted in the sudden sunshine that had come to her

Do you always asked her friend leaning forward with an irresistible
desire to win back the oldtime love and confidence too precious to be
exchanged for a little brief excitement or the barren honor of bagging
a bird to use Trixs elegant expression Fanny understood it then
and threw herself into Pollys arms crying with a shower of grateful
tears Oh my dear my dear did you do it for my sake

And Polly held her close saying in that tender voice of hers I did
nt mean to let a lover part this pair of friends if I could help it




CHAPTER XV BREAKERS AHEAD


GOING into the Shaws one evening Polly found Maud sitting on the
stairs with a troubled face

Oh Polly Im so glad youve come cried the little girl running
to hug her

Whats the matter deary

I dont know something dreadful must have happened for mamma and Fan
are crying together upstairs papa is shut up in the library and Tom is
raging round like a bear in the diningroom

I guess it is nt anything very bad Perhaps mamma is sicker than
usual or papa worried about business or Tom in some new scrape Dont
look so frightened Maudie but come into the parlor and see what Ive
got for you said Polly feeling that there was trouble of some sort in
the air but trying to cheer the child for her little face was full of
a sorrowful anxiety that went to Pollys heart

I dont think I can like anything till I know what the matter is
answered Maud Its something horrid Im sure for when papa came
home he went up to mammas room and talked ever so long and mamma
cried very loud and when I tried to go in Fan would nt let me and
she looked scared and strange I wanted to go to papa when he came down
but the door was locked and he said Not now my little girl and
then I sat here waiting to see what would happen and Tom came home But
when I ran to tell him he said Go away and dont bother and just
took me by the shoulders and put me out Oh dear everything is so
queer and horrid I dont know what to do

Maud began to cry and Polly sat down on the stairs beside her trying
to comfort her while her own thoughts were full of a vague fear All
at once the diningroom door opened and Toms head appeared A single
glance showed Polly that something was the matter for the care and
elegance which usually marked his appearance were entirely wanting His
tie was under one ear his hair in a toss the cherished moustache had
a neglected air and his face an expression both excited ashamed and
distressed even his voice betrayed disturbance for instead of the
affable greeting he usually bestowed upon the young lady he seemed to
have fallen back into the bluff tone of his boyish days and all he said
was Hullo Polly

How do you do answered Polly

Im in a devil of a mess thank you send that chicken up stairs and
come in and hear about it he said as if he had been longing to tell
some one and welcomed prudent Polly as a special providence

Go up deary and amuse yourself with this book and these ginger snaps
that I made for you theres a good child whispered Polly as Maud
rubbed away her tears and stared at Tom with round inquisitive eyes

Youll tell me all about it by and by wont you she whispered
preparing to obey

If I may answered Polly

Maud departed with unexpected docility and Polly went into the
diningroom where Tom was wandering about in a restless way If he
had been raging like a bear Polly would nt have cared she was so
pleased that he wanted her and so glad to be a confidante as she used
to be in the happy old days that she would joyfully have faced a much
more formidable person than reckless Tom

Now then what is it she said coming straight to the point

Guess

Youve killed your horse racing

Worse than that

You are suspended again

Worse than that

Trix has run away with somebody cried Polly with a gasp

Worse still

Oh Tom you have nt horse whipped or shot any one

Came pretty near blowing my own brains out but you see I did nt

I cant guess tell me quick

Well Im expelled

Tom paused on the rug as he gave the answer and looked at Polly to see
how she took it To his surprise she seemed almost relieved and after a
minute silence said soberly Thats bad very bad but it might have
been worse

It is worse and Tom walked away again with a despairing sort of
groan

Dont knock the chairs about but come and sit down and tell me
quietly

Cant do it

Well go on then Are you truly expelled Cant it be made up What
did you do

Its a true bill this time I just had a row with the Chapel watchman
and knocked him down If it was a first offence I might have got off
but you see Ive had no end of narrow escapes and this was my last
chance Ive lost it and now therell be the dickens to pay I knew
it was all up with me so I did nt wait to be turned out but just took
myself off

What will your father say

It will come hard on the governor but the worst of it is there Tom
stopped and stood a minute in the middle of the room with his head
down as if he did nt find it easy to tell even kind little Polly
Then out came the truth all in a breath just as he used to bolt out his
boyish misdemeanors and then back up against the wall ready to take the
consequences

I owe an awful lot of money that the governor dont know about

Oh Tom how could you

Ive been an extravagant rascal I know it and Im thundering sorry
but that dont help a fellow Ive got to tell the dear old buffer and
theres where it cuts

At another time Polly would have laughed at the contrast between Toms
face and his language but there was a sincere remorse which made even
the dreadful word buffer rather touching than otherwise

He will be very angry I dare say but hell help you wont he He
always does Fan says

Thats the worst of it you see Hes paid up so often that the last
time he said his patience could nt stand it nor his pocket either and
if I got into any more scrapes of that sort I must get out as I could
I meant to be as steady as Bunker Hill Monument but here I am again
worse than ever for last quarter I did nt say anything to father he
was so bothered by the loss of those ships just then so things have
mounted up confoundedly

What have you done with all your money

Hanged if I know

Cant you pay it anyway

Dont see how as I have nt a cent of my own and no way of getting
it unless I try gambling

Oh mercy no Sell your horse cried Polly after a minute of deep
meditation

I have but he did nt bring half I gave for him I lamed him last
winter and the beggar wont get over it

And that did nt pay up the debts

Only about a half ofem

Why Tom how much do you owe

I have dodged figuring it up till yesterday then things were so
desperate I thought I might as well face the truth so I overhauled my
accounts and theres the result

Tom threw a blotted crumpled paper into Pollys lap and tramped up
and down again faster than ever Polly took one look at the total and
clasped her hands for to her inexperienced eyes it looked appalling

Tidy little sum is nt it asked Tom who could nt bear the silence
or the startled grieved look in Pollys eyes

Its awful I dont wonder you dread telling your father

Id rather be shot I say Polly suppose we break it to him easy
added Tom after another turn

How do you mean

Why suppose Fan or better still you go and sort of pave the way I
cant bear to come down on him with the whole truth at once

So youd like to have me go and tell him for you Pollys lip curled
a little as she said that and she gave Tom a look that would have
shown him how blue eyes can flash if he had seen it But he was at the
window and did nt turn as he said slowly Well you see hes
so fond of you we all confide in you and you are so like one of the
family that it seems quite natural Just tell him Im expelled you
know and as much more as you like then Ill come in and well have
it out

Polly rose and went to the door without a word In doing so Tom caught
a glimpse of her face and said hastily Dont you think it would be a
good plan

No I dont

Why not Dont you think hed rather have it told him nicely by you
than blurted out as I always do blurt things

I know hed rather have his son go to him and tell the truth like a
man instead of sending a girl to do what he is afraid to do himself

If Polly had suddenly boxed his ears Tom could nt have looked more
taken aback than by that burst He looked at her excited face seemed
to understand the meaning of it and remembered all at once that he was
trying to hide behind a girl He turned scarlet said shortly Come
back Polly and walked straight out of the room looking as if going
to instant execution for poor Tom had been taught to fear his father
and had not entirely outgrown the dread

Polly sat down looking both satisfied and troubled I hope I did
right she said to herself I could nt bear to have him shirk and
seem cowardly He is nt only he did nt think how it seemed to me and
I dont wonder he was a little afraid Mr Shaw is so severe with the
poor fellow Oh dear what should we do if Will got into such scrapes
Thank goodness hes poor and cant Im so glad of that

Then she sat silent beside the halfopen door hearing the murmur of
Toms voice across the hall and hoping with all her heart that he
would nt have a very hard time He seemed to tell his story rapidly and
steadily without interruption to the end then Polly heard Mr Shaws
deeper voice say a few words at which Tom uttered a loud exclamation
as if taken by surprise Polly could nt distinguish a word so she kept
her seat wondering anxiously what was going on between the two men A
sudden pause seemed to follow Toms ejaculation then Mr Shaw talked a
long time in a low earnest tone so different from the angry one Polly
had expected to hear that it made her nervous for Mr Shaw usually
blew Tom up first and forgave him afterward as Maud said Presently
Toms voice was heard apparently asking eager questions to which brief
replies were given Then a dead silence fell upon the room and nothing
was heard but the spring rain softly falling out of doors All of a
sudden she heard a movement and Toms voice say audibly Let me bring
Polly and he appeared looking so pale and miserable that Polly was
frightened

Go and say something to him I cant poor old father if Id only
known and to Pollys utter dismay Tom threw himself into a chair and
laid his head down on the table as if he had got a blow that was too
much for him

Oh Tom what is it cried Polly hurrying to him full of fears she
dared not speak

Without looking up Tom answered in a smothered voice Failed all
gone to smash and tomorrow every one will know it

Polly held on to the back of Toms chair for a minute for the news
took her breath away and she felt as if the world was coming to an end
failed was such a vaguely dreadful word to her

Is it very bad she asked softly feeling as if anything was better
than to stand still and see Tom so wretched

Yes he means to give up everything Hes done his best but it cant
be staved off any longer and its all up with him

Oh I wish I had a million to give him cried Polly clasping her
hands with the tears running down her cheeks How does he bear it
Tom

Like a man Polly and Im proud of him said Tom looking up
all red and excited with the emotions he was trying to keep under
Everything has been against him and he has fought all alone to stand
the pressure but its too much for him and hes given in Its an
honorable failure mind you and no one can say a word against him Id
like to seeem try it and Tom clenched his hands as if it would
be an immense relief to him to thrash half a dozen aspersers of his
fathers honest name

Of course they cant This is what poor Maud troubled about He had
told your mother and Fan before you came and that is why they are so
unhappy I suppose

They are safe enough Father has nt touched mothers money hecould
nt rob his girls he said and thats all safe forem Is nt he
a trump Polly And Toms face shone with pride even while his lips
would twitch with a tenderer feeling

If I could only do anything to help cried Polly oppressed with her
own powerlessness

You can Go and be good to him you know how he needs it enough all
alone there I cant do it for Im only a curse instead of a comfort
to him

How did he take your news asked Polly who for a time had forgotten
the lesser trouble in the greater

Like a lamb for when Id done he only said My poor lad we must
bear with one another and then told his story

Im glad he was kind began Polly in a soothing tone but Tom cried
out remorsefully Thats what knocks me over Just when I ought to
be a pride and a prop to him I bring him my debts and disgrace and he
never says a word of blame Its no use I cant stand it and Toms
head went down again with something very like a sob that would come
in spite of manful efforts to keep it back for the poor fellow had the
warmest heart that ever was and all the fine waistcoats outside could
nt spoil it

That sound gave Polly more pain than the news of a dozen failures and
expulsions and it was as impossible for her to resist putting her
hand tenderly on the bent head as it was for her to help noticing with
pleasure how brown the little curls were growing and how soft they
were In spite of her sorrow she enjoyed that minute very much for she
was a born consoler and it is hardly necessary for me to add loved
this reprehensible Tom with all her heart It was a very foolish thing
for her to do she quite agreed to that she could nt understand it
explain it or help it she only felt that she did care for him very
much in spite of his faults his indifference and his engagement You
see she learned to love him one summer when he made them a visit That
was before Trix caught him and when she heard that piece of news Polly
could nt unlove him all at once though she tried very hard as was her
duty That engagement was such a farce that she never had much faith
in it so she put her love away in a corner of her heart and tried to
forget it hoping it would either die or have a right to live It did
nt make her very miserable because patience work and commonsense
lent her a hand and hope would keep popping up its bright face from the
bottom of her Pandorabox of troubles Now and then when any one said
Trix would nt jilt Tom or that Tom did care for Trix more than he
should Polly had a pang and thought she could nt possibly bear it
But she always found she could and so came to the conclusion that it
was a merciful provision of nature that girls hearts could stand
so much and their appetites continue good when unrequited love was
starving

Now she could not help yearning over this faulty wellbeloved
scapegrace Tom or help thinking with a little thrill of hope If Trix
only cared for his money she may cast him off now hes lost it but I
ll love him all the better because hes poor With this feeling warm
at her heart I dont wonder that Pollys hand had a soothing effect
and that after a heave or two Toms shoulders were quiet and certain
smothered sniffs suggested that he would be all right again if he could
only wipe his eyes without any ones seeing him do it

Polly seemed to divine his wish and tucking a little clean
handkerchief into one of his halfopen hands she said Im going to
your father now and with a farewell smooth so comforting that Tom
wished shed do it again she went away

As she paused a minute in the hall to steady herself Maud called her
from above and thinking that the women might need her more than the
men she ran up to find Fanny waiting for her in her own room

Mammas asleep quite worn out poor dear so we can talk in here
without troubling her said Fanny receiving her friend so quietly
that Polly was amazed

Let me come too I wont make any fuss its so dreadful to be shut
out everywhere and have people crying and talking and locked up and I
not know what it means said Maud beseechingly

You do know now Ive told her Polly said Fan as they sat down
together and Maud perched herself on the bed so that she might retire
among the pillows if her feelings were too much for her

Im glad you take it so well dear I was afraid it might upset you
said Polly seeing now that in spite of her quiet manner Fans eyes had
an excited look and her cheeks a feverish color

I shall groan and moan by and by I dare say but at first it sort of
dazed me and now it begins to excite me I ought to be full of sorrow
for poor papa and I am truly sorry but wicked as it may seem its a
fact Polly that Im half glad its happened for it takes me out of
myself and gives me something to do

Fannys eyes fell and her color rose as she spoke but Polly understood
why she wanted to forget herself and put her arm round her with a more
tender sympathy than Fanny guessed

Perhaps things are not as bad as they seem I dont know much about
such matters but Ive seen people who have failed and they seemed
just as comfortable as before said Polly

It wont be so with us for papa means to give up everything and not
have a word said against him Mammas little property is settled upon
her and has nt been risked That touched her so much She dreads
poverty even more than I do but she begged him to take it if it would
help him That pleased him but he said nothing would induce him to
do it for it would nt help much and was hardly enough to keep her
comfortable

Do you know what he means to do asked Polly anxiously

He said his plans were not made but he meant to go into the little
house that belonged to grandma as soon as he could for it was nt
honest for a bankrupt to keep up an establishment like this

I shant mind that at all I like the little housecause its got a
garden and theres a cunning room with a threecornered closet in it
that I always wanted If thats all I dont think bankrupting is so
very bad said Maud taking a cheerful view of things

Ah just wait till the carriage goes and the nice clothes and the
servants and we have to scratch along as we can Youll change
your mind then poor child said Fanny whose ideas of failure were
decidedly tragical

Will they take all my things away cried Maud in dismay

I dare say I dont know what we are allowed to keep but not much
I fancy and Fan looked as if strung up to sacrifice everything she
possessed

They shant have my new earrings Ill hideem and my best dress
and my gold smelling bottle Oh oh oh I think its mean to take a
little girls things away And Maud dived among the pillows to smother
a wail of anguish at the prospect of being bereft of her treasures

Polly soon lured her out again by assurances that she would nt be
utterly despoiled and promises to try and soften the hard hearts of
her fathers creditors if the earrings and the smellingbottle were
attached

I wonder if we shall be able to keep one servant just till we learn
how to do the work said Fanny looking at her white hands with a
sigh

But Maud clapped hers and gave a joyful bounce as she cried Now I
can learn to cook I love so to beat eggs Ill have an apron with
a bib to it like Pollys and a feather duster and sweep the stairs
maybe with my head tied up like Katy Oh what fun

Dont laugh at her or discourage her let her find comfort in bibs and
dustpans if she can whispered Polly to Fan while Maud took a joyful
header among the pillows and came up smiling and blowzy for she
loved housework and often got lectured for stolen visits to the
kitchen and surreptitious sweepings and dustings when the coast was
clear

Mamma is so feeble I shall have to keep house I suppose and you must
show me how Polly said Fan

Good practice maam as youll find out some day answered Polly
laughing significantly

Fanny smiled then grew both grave and sad This changes everything
the old set will drop me as we did the Mertons when their father
failed and myprospects as we say are quite ruined

I dont believe it your real friends wont drop you and youll find
out which the true ones are now I know one friend who will be kinder
than ever

Oh Polly do you think so and Fannys eyes softened with sudden
tears

I know who she means cried Maud always eager to find out things It
s herself Polly wont mind if we are poorcause she likes beggars

Is that who you meant asked Fan wistfully

No its a much better and dearer friend than I am said Polly
pinching Fannys cheek as it reddened prettily under her eyes Youll
never guess Maud so I would nt try but be planning what you will put
in your cunning threecornered closet when you get it

Having got rid of Miss Paulina Pry as Tom called Maud who was
immediately absorbed by her cupboard the older girls soberly discussed
the sudden change which had come and Polly was surprised to see what
unexpected strength and sense Fanny showed Polly was too unconscious
of the change which love had made in herself to understand at first the
cause of her friends new patience and fortitude but she rejoiced over
it and felt that her prophecy would yet be fulfilled Presently Maud
emerged from her new closet bringing a somewhat startling idea with
her

Do bankrupting men Maud liked that new word always have fits

Mercy no What put that into your head child cried Polly

Why Mr Merton did and I was thinking perhaps papa had got one down
there and it kind of frightened me

Mr Mertons was a bad disgraceful failure and I dont wonder he had
a fit Ours is nt and papa wont do anything of that sort you may be
sure said Fanny with as proud an air as if our failure was rather
an honor than otherwise

Dont you think you and Maud had better go down and see him asked
Polly

Perhaps he would nt like it and I dont know what to say either
began Fan but Polly said eagerly I know he would like it Never mind
what you say just go and show him that you dont doubt or blame him
for this but love him all the more and are ready and glad to help him
bear the trouble

Im going I aint afraid Ill just hug him and say Im ever so
glad we are going to the little house cried Maud scrambling off the
bed and running down stairs

Come with me Polly and tell me what to do said Fanny drawing her
friend after her

Youll know what to do when you see him better than I can tell you
answered Polly readily yielding for she knew they considered her
quite one of the family as Tom said

At the study door they found Maud whose courage had given out for Mr
Mertons fit rather haunted her Polly opened the door and the minute
Fanny saw her father she did know what to do The fire was low the gas
dim and Mr Shaw was sitting in his easychair his gray head in both
his hands looking lonely old and bowed down with care Fanny gave
Polly one look then went and took the gray head in both her arms
saying with a tender quiver in her voice Father dear weve come to
help you bear it

Mr Shaw looked up and seeing in his daughters face something that
never had been there before put his arm about her and leaned his
tired head against her as if when least expected he had found the
consolation he most needed In that minute Fanny felt with mingled joy
and selfreproach what a daughter might be to her father and Polly
thinking of feeble selfish Mrs Shaw asleep up stairs saw with
sudden clearness what a wife should be to her husband a helpmeet not
a burden Touched by these unusual demonstrations Maud crept quietly
to her fathers knee and whispered with a great tear shining on her
little pug nose Papa we dont mind it much and Im going to help
Fan keep house for you Id like to do it truly

Mr Shaws other arm went round the child and for a minute no one said
anything for Polly had slipped behind his chair that nothing should
disturb the three who were learning from misfortune how much they loved
one another Presently Mr Shaw steadied himself and asked Where is my
other daughter wheres my Polly

She was there at once gave him one of the quiet kisses that had more
than usual tenderness in it for she loved to hear him say my other
daughter and then she whispered Dont you want Tom too

Of course I do where is the poor fellow

Ill bring him and Polly departed with most obliging alacrity

But in the hall she paused a minute to peep into the glass and see if
she was all right for somehow she was more anxious to look neat and
pretty to Tom in his hour of trouble than she had ever been in his
prosperous days In lifting her arms to perk up the bow at her throat
she knocked a hat off the bracket Now a shiny black beaver is not an
object exactly calculated to inspire tender or romantic sentiments one
would fancy but that particular stove pipe seemed to touch Polly to
the heart for she caught it up as if its fall suggested a greater one
smoothed out a slight dint as if it was symbolical of the hard knocks
its owners head was now in danger of receiving and stood looking at
it with as much pity and respect as if it had been the crown of a
disinherited prince Girls will do such foolish little things and
though we laugh at them I think we like them the better for it after
all

Richard was himself again when Polly entered for the handkerchief had
disappeared his head was erect his face was steady and his whole
air had a dogged composure which seemed to say to fate Hit away Im
ready He did not hear Polly come in for he was looking fixedly at
the fire with eyes that evidently saw a very different future there
from that which it used to show him but when she said Tom dear your
father wants you he got up at once held out his hand to her saying
Come too we cant get on without you and took her back into the
study with him

Then they had a long talk for the family troubles seemed to warm and
strengthen the family affection and confidence and as the young people
listened while Mr Shaw told them as much of his business perplexities
as they could understand every one of them blamed him or herself for
going on so gayly and blindly while the storm was gathering and the
poor man was left to meet it all alone Now however the thunderclap
had come and after the first alarm finding they were not killed they
began to discover a certain halfanxious halfpleasant excitement
in talking it over encouraging one another and feeling unusually
friendly as people do when a sudden shower drives two or three to the
shelter of one umbrella

It was a sober talk but not all sad for Mr Shaw felt inexpressibly
comforted by his childrens unexpected sympathy and they trying to
take the downfall cheerfully for his sake found it easier to bear
themselves They even laughed occasionally for the girls in their
ignorance asked queer questions Tom made ludicrously unbusinesslike
propositions and Maud gave them one hearty peal that did a world of
good by pensively remarking when the plans for the future had been
explained to her Im so relieved for when papa said we must give up
everything and mamma called us all beggars I did think Id got to go
round asking for cold vittles with a big basket and an old shawl over
my head I said once Id like that but Im afraid I should nt for I
cant bear Indian cake and cold potatoes thats what the poor children
always seem to get and I should hate to have Grace and the rest see me
scuffing round the back gates

My little girl shall never come to that if I can help it said Mr
Shaw holding her close with a look that made Maud add as she laid her
cheek against his own But Id do it father if you asked me to for
I truly want to help

So do I cried Fanny wondering at the same minute how it would seem
to wear turned silks and clean her gloves

Tom said nothing but drew toward him a paper of figures which his
father had drawn up and speedily reduced himself to the verge of
distraction by trying to understand them in his ardent desire to prove
his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel

We shall pull through children so dont borrow trouble only be ready
for discomforts and annoyances Put your pride in your pockets and
remember poverty is nt disgraceful but dishonesty is

Polly had always loved kind Mr Shaw but now she respected him
heartily and felt that she had not done him justice when she sometimes
thought that he only cared for making money

I should nt wonder if this was a good thing for the whole family
though it dont look so Mrs Shaw will take it the hardest but it may
stir her up so she will forget her nerves and be as busy and happy as
mother is said Polly to herself in a hopeful mood for poverty was an
old friend and she had learned long ago not to fear it but to take its
bitter and its sweet and make the best of both

When they parted for the night Polly slipped away first to leave them
free yet could nt help lingering outside to see how tenderly the girls
parted from their father Tom had nt a word to say for himself for men
dont kiss caress or cry when they feel most and all he could do to
express his sympathy and penitence was to wring his fathers hand with
a face full of respect regret and affection and then bolt up stairs
as if the furies were after him as they were in a mild and modern
form




CHAPTER XVI A DRESS PARADE


THE weeks that followed taught the Shaws as many other families have
been taught how rapidly riches take to themselves wings and fly away
when they once begin to go Mr Shaw carried out his plans with an
energy and patience that worked wonders and touched the hearts of his
hardest creditors The big house was given up as soon as possible and
the little house taken being made comfortable with the furniture Madam
left there when she went to live with her son The oldfashioned things
had been let with the house and now seemed almost like a gift from
Grandma doubly precious in these troublous times At the auction
several persons tried to show the family that though they had lost
their fortune friends still remained for one bid in Fannys piano
and sent it to her another secured certain luxurious articles for Mrs
Shaws comfort and a third saved such of Mr Shaws books as he valued
most for he had kept his word and given up everything with the most
punctilious integrity So the little house was not bare but made
pleasant to their eyes by these waifs from the wreck brought them by
the tide of sympathy and goodwill which soon set in Everybody who
knew them hastened to call many from a real regard but more from mere
curiosity to see how they took it This was one of the hardest things
they had to bear and Tom used strong language more than once when some
fine lady came to condole and went away to gossip Pollys hopes of
Mrs Shaw were disappointed for misfortune did not have a bracing
effect She took to her bed at once received her friends in tears and a
pointlace cap and cheered her family by plaintively inquiring when she
was to be taken to the almshouse This was hard for Fanny but after
an interval of despair she came to the conclusion that under the
circumstances it was the best thing her mother could have done and
with something of her fathers energy Fanny shouldered the new burden
feeling that at last necessity had given her what she had long needed
something to do

The poor girl knew as much of household affairs as Snip but pride and
the resolution to stand by Father kept up her courage and she worked
away with feverish activity at whatever task came first till just as
strength and heart were about to fail order began to emerge from chaos
and the vision of a home made happy and comfortable by her skill and
care came to repay and sustain her

Maud being relieved from the fear of backdoor beggary soon became
reconciled to bankruptcy thought it rather a good joke on the whole
for children like novelty and dont care much for Mrs Grundy She
regarded the new abode as a baby house on a large scale where she
was allowed to play her part in the most satisfactory manner From the
moment when on taking possession of the coveted room she opened the
doors of the threecornered closet and found a little kettle just like
Pollys standing there she felt that a good time was coming for her
and fell to dusting furniture washing cups and making toast the
happiest fussiest little housewife in the city For Maud inherited the
notable gifts of her grandmother and would have made a capital farmers
daughter in spite of her city breeding

Polly came and went through all these changes faithful helpful and
as cheery as she could be when her friends were in trouble The parts
seemed reversed now and it was Polly who gave Fanny who received for
where everything seemed strange and new to Fan Polly was quite at home
and every one of the unfashionable domestic accomplishments now came
into play to the comfort of the Shaws and the great satisfaction of
Polly She could not do enough to prove her gratitude for former favors
and went toiling and moiling about feeling that the hardest most
disagreeable tasks were her especial duty In the moving nothing suited
her better than to trot up and down lugging heavy things to pound her
fingers black and blue nailing carpets and curtains and the day she
nearly broke her neck tumbling down the cellar stairs in her eagerness
to see that Mrs Shaws wine was rightly stored she felt that she was
only paying her debts and told Tom she liked it when he picked her up
looking as grimy as a chimneysweep

You can turn your hand to anything you clever girl so do come and
give me some advice for I am in the depths of despair said Fanny when
the maidofallwork as Polly called herself found a leisure hour

What is it Moths in the furs a smoky chimney or smallpox next
door asked Polly as they entered Fans room where Maud was trying on
old bonnets before the lookingglass

Actually I have nothing to wear began Fan impressively Ive been
too busy to think or care till now but here it is nearly May and I have
hardly a decent rag to my back Usually you know I just go to Mrs
OGrady and tell her what I want she makes my spring wardrobe Papa
pays the bill and there I am Now Ive looked into the matter and I
declare to you Polly Im frightened to see how much it costs to dress
me

Not so much as some girls I know said Polly encouragingly

Perhaps not for I have a conscience and taste is economy sometimes
but really Polly I have nt the heart to ask Papa for a cent just
now and yet I must have clothes You are such a genius for planning and
working wonders that I throw myself upon you and ask How shall I make
a spring wardrobe out of nothing

Let me see thenothing before I advise Bring out every rag youve
got and well see what can be done said Polly looking as if she
enjoyed the prospect for she had a great deal of that feminine faculty
which we call knack and much practice had increased it

Fanny brought out her rags and was astonished to see how many she had
for chair sofa bed and bureau were covered and still Maud who was
burrowing in the closets kept crying Heres another

Theres a discouraging heap of rubbish for you said Fan as she
added a faded muslin to the last pile

Now to me yourrubbish looks very encouraging because there is good
material there and not much wornout finery thats my detestation
for you cant do anything with it Let me see five bonnets Put the
winter ones away till autumn rip up the summer ones and out of three
old ones well get a pretty new one if my eyes dont deceive me

Ill rip and then do let me see you make a bonnet it must be so
interesting said Maud whipping out her scissors and eagerly beginning
to reduce a shabby little bonnet to its original elements Now the
dresses continued Polly who had rapidly sorted out the piles

Will you have the goodness to look at this said Fan holding up a
gray street suit faded past cure

Polly whisked it wrong side out and showing the clean bright fabric
said with a triumphant wave Behold your new suit fresh trimming and
less of it will finish you off as smart as ever

I never wore a turned dress in my life do you suppose people will know
it said Fan doubtfully

What if they do It wont hurt you Not one in a hundred will ever
think anything about your dress except that it is pretty Ive worn
turned and dyed gowns all my days and it dont seem to have alienated
my friends or injured my constitution

That it has nt Im a goose Polly and Ill get over the feeling
that its sort of disgraceful to be poor and have to economize Well
turn the gray and Ill wear it bravely

Then it will be more becoming than ever Oh heres the pretty violet
silk That will make a lovely suit cried Polly going on with the
review

Dont see how two draggled skirts and a stained waist can be
transformed into a whole rig said Fan sitting on the bed with her
garments strewn about her in various attitudes of limp despondency

Well maam my plan is this began Polly imitating Mrs OGradys
important tone and bad grammar Gores is out and plaits is in
therefore as the top of this skirt is quite fresh we will take off the
ruffles turn it upside down and leave it plain The upper skirt
will be made scanter and finished with a frill then the waist can be
refreshed with the best parts of these wide flounces and out of those
new bits we will concoct a hat The black lace Maud has just taken
off the green one will do to edge the violet and with your nice silk
mantilla you are complete dont you see

I dont quite see it yet but I have firm faith that I shall in time
and consider my calling costume finished said Fanny getting more and
more interested as she saw her condemned wardrobe coming out fresh again
under Pollys magic knack

There are two then that piqu is all right if you cut the tail off
the jacket and change the trimming a bit The muslins only need mending
and doing up to look as well as ever you ought not to put them away
torn and soiled my child The two black silks will be good standbys
for years If I were you Id have a couple of neat pretty prints for
homewear and then I dont see why you are nt fixed well enough for
our short season

Cant I do anything with this barege Its one of my favorite dresses
and I hate to give it up

You wore that thoroughly out and its only fit for the ragbag Yes
it was very pretty and becoming I remember but its day is over

Fanny let the dress lie in her lap a minute as she absently picked at
the fringe smiling to herself over the happy time when she wore it last
and Sydney said she only needed cowslips in her lap to look like spring
Presently she folded it up and put it away with a sigh but it never
went into the ragbag and my sentimental readers can understand what
saved it

The ball dresses had better be put nicely away till next year began
Polly coming to a rainbow colored heap

My day is over I shall never use them again Do what you like with
them said Fan calmly

Did you ever sell your castoff finery as many ladies do asked
Polly

Never I dont like the fashion I give it away or let Maud have it
for tableaux

I wonder if you would mind my telling you something Belle proposed

If its an offer to buy my clothes I should mind answered Fanny
sharply

Then I wont and Polly retired behind a cloud of arsenicgreen gauze
which made her look as if she had the cholera

If she wanted to buy that horrid newgooseberrycolored gown as
Tom calls it Id let her have it cheap put in Maud who was of a
practical turn

Does she want it Polly asked Fan whose curiosity got the better of
her pride

Well she merely asked me if I thought youd be mortally offended
if she offered to take it off your hands as youd never worn it You
dont like it and in another season it will be all out of fashion
said Polly from her verdant retreat

What did you say

I saw she meant it kindly so I said Id ask Now between ourselves
Fan the price of that dress would give you all youll want for your
spring fixings thats one consideration then heres another which
may have some weight with you added Polly slyly Trix told Belle she
was going to ask you for the dress as you would nt care to wear it
now That made Belle fire up and say it was a mean thing to do without
offering some return for a costly thing like that and then Belle said
in her blunt way Ill give Fan all she paid for it and more too if
it will be any help to her I dont care for the dress but Id like to
slip a little money into her pocket for I know she needs it and is too
good to ask dear Mr Shaw for anything she can get on without

Did she say that Ill give her the dress and not take a penny for
it cried Fan flushing up with mingled anger toward Trix and gratitude
to Belle

That wont suit her you let me manage it and dont feel any shame or
anxiety about it You did many a kind and generous thing for Belle when
you had the power and you liked to do it now let her pay her debts
and have the same pleasure

If she looks at it in that way it makes a difference Perhaps Id
better the money would be an immense help only I dont quite like to
take it

Kings and queens sell their jewels when times are hard or they get
turned off their thrones and no one thinks it anything amiss so
why need you Its just a little transaction between two friends who
exchange things they dont want for things which they do and Id do it
if I were you

Well see about it said Fan privately resolving to take Pollys
advice

If I had lots of things like Fan Id have an auction and get all
I could for them Why dont you asked Maud beginning on her third
bonnet

We will said Polly and mounting a chair she put up bid in and
knocked down Fans entire wardrobe to an imaginary group of friends
with such droll imitations of each one that the room rang with laughter

Thats enough nonsense now well return to business said Polly
descending breathless but satisfied with the effect of her fun

These white muslins and pretty silks will keep for years so I should
lay them by till they are needed It will save buying and you can go to
your stock any time and make over what you want Thats the way Mother
does weve always had things sent us from richer friends and whatever
was nt proper for us to wear at the time Mother put away to be used
when we needed it Such funny bundles as we used to have sometimes odd
shoes bonnets without crowns stockings without heels or toes and old
finery of all sorts We used to rush when a bundle came and sit round
while Mother opened it The boys always made fun of the things though
they were as grateful really as any of us Will made a verse one day
which we thought pretty well for a little chap To poor country folks
Who have nt any clothes Rich folks to relieve them Send old lace
gowns and satin bows

I think that Will is going to be as nice a poet as Mr Shakespeare
remarked Maud in a tone of serious conviction

He is already a Milton but I dont believe he will ever be anything
but a poet in name said Polly working away while she talked

Did nt your mother ever let you wear the nice things that came asked
Maud

No she thought it was nt the thing for a poor ministers girls to go
flourishing about in secondhand finery so she did what Im doing now
put away what would be useful and proper for us by and by and let us
play with the shabby silk bonnets and dirty flounced gowns Such fun
as we used to have up in our big garret I remember one day wed been
playing have a ball and were all rigged up even the boys Some new
neighbors came to call and expressed a wish to see us having been told
that we were pattern children Mother called us but we had paraded out
into the garden after our ball and were having a concert as we sat
about on the cabbages for green satin seats so we did nt hear the
call and just as the company was going a great noise arrested them
on the doorstep and round the corner of the house rattled Ned in
full costume wheeling Kitty in a barrow while Jimmy Will and I ran
screaming after looking like Bedlamites for we were playing that Lady
Fitz Perkins had fainted and was being borne home senseless in a cab
I thought mother would kill herself with laughing and you can imagine
what a fine impression the strangers received of the model children

Maud was so tickled with this youthful prank that she unguardedly sat
down to laugh on the edge of an open trunk immediately doubled up fell
in and was with difficulty extricated

People in the country have great deal nicer times than we do I never
rode in a wheelbarrow I never sat on cabbages and I dont think its
fair she said with an injured expression You need nt save any old
silk gowns for me I dont mean to be a fine lady when I grow up Im
going to be a farmers wife and make butter and cheese and have ten
children and raise pigs she added in one enthusiastic burst

I do believe she will if she can find a farmer anywhere said Fanny

Oh Im going to have Will I asked him and he said All right He
s going to preach Sundays and work on the farm the rest of the time
Well he is so you need nt laugh for weve made all our plans
said Maud with comical dignity as she tried the effect of an old white
bonnet wondering if farmers wives could wear ostrich feathers when
they went to meeting

Blessed innocence Dont you wish you were a child and dared tell what
you want murmured Fanny

I wish I had seen Wills face when Maud proposed answered Polly with
a nod which answered her friends speech better than her words

Any news of anybody whispered Fan affecting to examine a sleeve with
care

Still at the South dont think late events have been reported yet
that accounts for absence answered Polly

I think Sir Philip was hit harder than was supposed said Fan

I doubt it but time cures wounds of that sort amazing quick

Wish it did

Who is Sir Philip demanded Maud pricking up her ears

A famous man who lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth answered Fan
with a look at Polly

Oh And Maud seemed satisfied but the sharp child had her suspicions
nevertheless

There will be an immense deal of work in all this fixing over and I
hate to sew said Fanny to divert a certain persons thoughts

Jenny and I are going to help We are your debtors as well as Belle
and demand the privilege of paying up Blessings like curses come home
to roost Fan

Mine come home a good deal bigger than they went answered Fanny
looking pleased that little favors should be so faithfully remembered

The interest on that sort of investment rolls up beautifully you know
Now rip that dress for Jenny to put in order and Ill toss you up a
bonnet in less than no time said Polly determined to have things go
smoothly for she knew Fans feelings had been a good deal tried lately
in many ways

I must have something to match my dress and blue inside said Fanny
bringing out her ribbon boxes

Anything you like my dear when it comes to bonnets I am usually
inspired I have it There we are And nothing could be nicer cried
Polly making a dive among the silks Fan was turning over with a lost
expression This bit of silvergray is all I ask heres enough for
a killing bonnet and those forgetmenots are both pretty and
appropriate

You wretch be still cried Fanny as Polly looked up at her with a
wicked laugh in her eyes

It will be done in time and the dress likewise so look your
prettiest and accept my blessing continued Polly seeing that Fan
liked her raillery

Time for what asked Paulina Pry

Your wedding dear sweetly answered Fan for Pollys pleasant hints
and predictions put her in a charming humor and even made old clothes
of little consequence

Maud gave an incredulous sniff and wondered why big girls need to be
so dreadful mysterious about their old secrets

This silk reminds me of Kittys performance last summer A little
checked silk was sent in our spring bundle from Mrs Davenport and
Mother said Kit might have it if she could make it do So I washed it
nicely and we fussed and planned but it came short by half of one
sleeve I gave it up but Kit went to work and matched every scrap that
was left so neatly that she got out the half sleeve put it on the under
side and no one was the wiser How many pieces do you think she put in
Maud

Fifty was the wise reply

No only ten but that was pretty well for a fourteenyearold
dressmaker You ought to have seen the little witch laugh in her sleeve
when any one admired the dress for she wore it all summer and looked as
pretty as a pink in it Such things are great fun when you get used to
them besides contriving sharpens your wits and makes you feel as if
you had more hands than most people

I think well get a farm near your house I should like to know
Kitty said Maud feeling a curious interest in a girl who made such
peculiar patchwork

The dressparade is over and Im ever so much obliged to you Polly
for helping me through and showing me how to make the best of things
I hope in time to have as many hands as you said Fan gratefully
when the simple bonnet was done and everything planned out ready to be
finished

I hope you will soon have two good strong ones beside your own my
dear answered Polly as she vanished with a parting twinkle that kept
Fans face bright all day




CHAPTER XVII PLAYING GRANDMOTHER


I THINK Tom had the hardest time of all for besides the family
troubles he had many of his own to perplex and harass him College
scrapes were soon forgotten in greater afflictions but there were
plenty of tongues to blame that extravagant dog and plenty of heads
to wag ominously over prophecies of the good time Tom Shaw would now
make on the road to ruin As reporters flourish in this country of
course Tom soon heard all the friendly criticisms passed upon him and
his career and he suffered more than anybody guessed for the truth
that was at the bottom of the gossip filled him with the sharp regret
and impotent wrath against himself as well as others which drives many
a proud fellow so placed to destruction or the effort that redeems
boyish folly and makes a man of him

Now that he had lost his heritage Tom seemed to see for the first
time how goodly it had been how rich in power pleasure and gracious
opportunities He felt its worth even while he acknowledged with the
sense of justice that is strong in manly men how little he deserved
a gift which he had so misused He brooded over this a good deal for
like the bat in the fable he did nt seem to find any place in the new
life which had begun for all Knowing nothing of business he was not
of much use to his father though he tried to be and generally ended
by feeling that he was a hindrance not a help Domestic affairs were
equally out of his line and the girls more frank than their father
did not hesitate to tell him he was in the way when he offered to lend
a hand anywhere After the first excitement was over and he had time to
think heart and energy seemed to die out remorse got hold of him and
as generous thoughtless natures are apt to do when suddenly confronted
with conscience he exaggerated his faults and follies into sins of the
deepest dye and fancied he was regarded by others as a villain and an
outcast Pride and penitence made him shrink out of sight as much as
possible for he could not bear pity even when silently expressed by a
friendly hand or a kindly eye He stayed at home a good deal and loafed
about with a melancholy and neglected air vanished when anyone came
talked very little and was either pathetically humble or tragically
cross He wanted to do something but nothing seemed to appear and
while he waited to get his poise after the downfall he was so very
miserable that Im afraid if it had not been for one thing my poor
Tom would have got desperate and been a failure But when he seemed
most useless outcast and forlorn he discovered that one person needed
him one person never found him in the way one person always welcomed
and clung to him with the strongest affection of a very feeble nature
This dependence of his mothers was Toms salvation at that crisis of
his life and the gossips who said softly to one another over their
muffins and tea It really would be a relief to that whole family if
poor dear Mrs Shaw could be ahem mercifully removed did not know
that the invalids weak idle hands were unconsciously keeping the son
safe in that quiet room where she gave him all that she had to give
motherlove till he took heart again and faced the world ready to
fight his battles manfully

Dear dear how old and bent poor father does look I hope he wont
forget to order my sweetbread sighed Mrs Shaw one day as she watched
her husband slowly going down the street

Tom who stood by her idly spinning the curtain tassel followed the
familiar figure with his eye and seeing how gray the hair had grown
how careworn the florid face and how like a weary old man his once
strong handsome father walked he was smitten by a new pang of
selfreproach and with his usual impetuosity set about repairing the
omission as soon as he discovered it

Ill see to your sweetbread mum Goodby back to dinner and with a
hasty kiss Tom was off

He did nt know exactly what he meant to do but it had suddenly come
over him that he was hiding from the storm and letting his father
meet it alone for the old man went to his office every day with the
regularity of a machine that would go its usual round until it stopped
while the young man stayed at home with the women and let his mother
comfort him

He has a right to be ashamed of me but I act as if I was ashamed of
him dare say people think so Ill show them that I aint yes by the
powers I will and Tom drew on his gloves with the air of a man about
to meet and conquer an enemy

Have an arm sir If you dont mind Ill walk down with you Little
commission for mother nice day is nt it

Tom rather broke down at the end of his speech for the look of pleased
surprise with which his father greeted him the alacrity with which he
accepted and leaned on the strong arm offered him proved that the
daily walks had been solitary and doubtless sad ones I think Mr Shaw
understood the real meaning of that little act of respect and felt
better for the hopeful change it seemed to foretell But he took it
quietly and leaving his face to speak for him merely said Thanky
Tom yes mother will enjoy her dinner twice as much if you order it

Then they began to talk business with all their might as if they feared
that some trace of sentiment might disgrace their masculine dignity But
it made no difference whether they discussed lawsuits or love mortgages
or mothers the feeling was all right and they knew it so Mr Shaw
walked straighter than usual and Tom felt that he was in his proper
place again The walk was not without its trials however for while it
did Toms heart good to see the cordial respect paid to his father
it tried his patience sorely to see also inquisitive or disapproving
glances fixed upon himself when hats were lifted to his father and
to hear the hearty Good day Mr Shaw drop into a cool or careless
Thats the son its hard on him Wild fellow do him good

Granted but you need nt hit a man when hes down muttered Tom to
himself feeling every moment a stronger desire to do something that
should silence everybody Id cut away to Australia if it was nt for
mother anything anywhere to get out of the way of people who know me
I never can right myself here with all the fellows watching and laying
wagers whether I sink or swim Hang Greek and Latin wish Id learned
a trade and had something to fall back upon Have nt a blessed thing
now but decent French and my fists Wonder if old Bell dont want
a clerk for the Paris branch of the business That would nt be bad
faith Ill try it

And when Tom had landed his father safely at the office to the great
edification of all beholders he screwed up his courage and went to
prefer his request feeling that the prospect brightened a little But
Mr Bell was not in a good humor and only gave Tom a severe lecture on
the error of his ways which sent him home much depressed and caused
the horizon to lower again

As he roamed about the house that afternoon trying to calculate how
much an Australian outfit would cost the sound of lively voices and
clattering spoons attracted him to the kitchen There he found
Polly giving Maud lessons in cookery for the new help not being a
highpriced article could not be depended on for desserts and Mrs
Shaw would have felt as if the wolf was at the door if there was not a
sweet dish at dinner Maud had a genius for cooking and Fanny hated
it so that little person was in her glory studying receipt books and
taking lessons whenever Polly could give them

Gracious me Tom dont come now we are awful busy Men dont belong
in kitchens cried Maud as her brother appeared in the doorway

Could nt think what you were about Mum is asleep and Fan out so I
loafed down to see if there was any fun afoot said Tom lingering as
if the prospect was agreeable He was a social fellow and very grateful
just then to any one who helped him to forget his worries for a time
Polly knew this felt that his society would not be a great affliction
to herself at least and whispering to Maud He wont know she added
aloud Come in if you like and stir this cake for me it needs a
strong hand and mine are tired There put on that apron to keep you
tidy sit here and take it easy

I used to help grandma bat up cake and rather liked it if I remember
right said Tom letting Polly tie a checked apron on him put a big
bowl into his hands and settle him near the table where Maud
was picking raisins and she herself stirring busily about among
spiceboxes rollingpins and butterpots

You do it beautifully Tom Ill give you a conundrum to lighten your
labor Why are bad boys like cake asked Polly anxious to cheer him
up

Because a good beating makes them better I doubt that myself though
answered Tom nearly knocking the bottom of the bowl out with his
energetic demonstrations for it really was a relief to do something

Bright boy heres a plum for you and Polly threw a plump raisin
into his mouth

Put in lots wont you Im rather fond of plumcake observed
Tom likening himself to Hercules with the distaff and finding his
employment pleasant if not classical

I always do if I can theres nothing I like better than to shovel in
sugar and spice and make nice plummy cake for people Its one of the
few things I have a gift for

Youve hit it this time Polly you certainly have a gift for putting
a good deal of both articles into your own and other peoples lives
which is lucky as we all have to eat that sort of cake whether we
like it or not observed Tom so soberly that Polly opened her eyes
and Maud exclaimed I do believe hes preaching

Feel as if I could sometimes continued Tom then his eye fell upon
the dimples in Pollys elbows and he added with a laugh Thats more
in your line maam cant you give us a sermon

A short one Life my brethren is like plumcake began Polly
impressively folding her floury hands In some the plums are all on
the top and we eat them gayly till we suddenly find they are gone In
others the plums sink to the bottom and we look for them in vain as we
go on and often come to them when it is too late to enjoy them But
in the wellmade cake the plums are wisely scattered all through and
every mouthful is a pleasure We make our own cakes in a great measure
therefore let us look to it my brethren that they are mixed according
to the best receipt baked in a well regulated oven and gratefully
eaten with a temperate appetite

Good good cried Tom applauding with the wooden spoon Thats a
model sermon Polly short sweet sensible and not a bit sleepy Im
one of your parish and will see that you get yourcelery punctooal
as old Deacon Morse used to say

Thank you brother my wants is few and ravens scurser than they used
to be as dear old Parson Miller used to answer Now Maud bring on
the citron and Polly began to put the cake together in what seemed
a most careless and chaotic manner while Tom and Maud watched with
absorbing interest till it was safely in the oven

Now make your custards dear Tom may like to beat the eggs for you it
seems to have a good effect upon his constitution

Firstrate handem along and Tom smoothed his apron with a cheerful
air By the way Syds got back I met him yesterday and he treated me
like a man and a brother he added as if anxious to contribute to the
pleasures of the hour

Im so glad cried Polly clapping her hands regardless of the egg
she held which dropped and smashed on the floor at her feet Careless
thing Pick it up Maud Ill get some more and Polly whisked out of
the room glad of an excuse to run and tell Fan who had just come
in lest hearing the news in public she might be startled out of the
wellbred composure with which young ladies are expected to receive
tidings even of the most vital importance

You know all about history dont you asked Maud suddenly

Not quite modestly answered Tom

I just want to know if there really was a man named Sir Philip in the
time of Queen Elizabeth

You mean Sir Philip Sidney Yes he lived then and a fine old fellow he
was too

There I knew the girls did nt mean him cried Maud with a chop that
sent the citron flying

What mischief are you up to now you little magpie

I shant tell you what they said because I dont remember much of it
but I heard Polly and Fan talking about some one dreadful mysterious
and when I asked who it was Fan saidSir Philip Ho she need nt
think I believe it I sawem laugh and blush and poke one another
and I knew it was nt about any old Queen Elizabeth man cried Maud
turning up her nose as far as that somewhat limited feature would go

Look here you are letting cats out of the bag Never mind I thought
so They dont tell us their secrets but we are so sharp we cant help
finding them out can we said Tom looking so much interested that
Maud could nt resist airing her knowledge a little

Well I dare say it is nt proper for you to know but I am old enough
now to be told anything and those girls better mind what they say for
Im not a stupid chit like Blanche I just wish you could have heard
them go on Im sure theres something very nice about Mr Sydney
they looked so pleased when they whispered and giggled on the bed and
thought I was ripping bonnets and did nt hear a word

Which looked most pleased asked Tom investigating the kitchen boiler
with deep interest

Wellpears to me Polly did she talked most and looked funny and
very happy all the time Fan laughed a good deal but I guess Polly is
the loveress replied Maud after a moments reflection

Hold your tongue shes coming and Tom began to pump as if the house
was on fire

Down came Polly with heightened color bright eyes and not a single
egg Tom took a quick look at her over his shoulder and paused as if
the fire was suddenly extinguished Something in his face made Polly
feel a little guilty so she fell to grating nutmeg with a vigor which
made red cheeks the most natural thing in life Maud the traitor sat
demurely at work looking very like what Tom had called her a magpie
with mischief in its head Polly felt a change in the atmosphere but
merely thought Tom was tired so she graciously dismissed him with a
stick of cinnamon as she had nothing else just then to lay upon the
shrine Fans got the books and maps you wanted Go and rest now Im
much obliged heres your wages Bridget

Good luck to your messes answered Tom as he walked away meditatively
crunching his cinnamon and looking as if he did not find it as spicy as
usual He got his books but did not read them for shutting himself up
in the little room called Toms den he just sat down and brooded

When he came down to breakfast the next morning he was greeted with
a general Happy birthday Tom and at his place lay gifts from every
member of the family not as costly as formerly perhaps but infinitely
dearer as tokens of the love that had outlived the change and only
grown the warmer for the test of misfortune In his present state of
mind Tom felt as if he did not deserve a blessed thing so when every
one exerted themselves to make it a happy day for him he understood
what it means to be nearly killed with kindness and sternly resolved
to be an honor to his family or perish in the attempt Evening brought
Polly to what she called a festive tea and when they gathered round
the table another gift appeared which though not of a sentimental
nature touched Tom more than all the rest It was a most delectable
cake with a nosegay atop and round it on the snowy frosting there
ran a pink inscription just as it had been every year since Tom could
remember

Name age and date like a nice white tombstone observed Maud
complacently at which funereal remark Mrs Shaw who was down in honor
of the day dropped her napkin and demanded her salts

Whose doing is that asked Tom surveying the gift with satisfaction
for it recalled the happier birthdays which seemed very far away now

I did nt know what to give you for youve got everything a man
wants and I was in despair till I remembered that dear grandma always
made you a little cake like that and that you once said it would nt be
a happy birthday without it So I tried to make it just like hers and I
do hope it will prove a good sweet plummy one

Thank you was all Tom said as he smiled at the giver but Polly knew
that her present had pleased him more than the most elegant trifle she
could have made

It ought to be good for you beat it up yourself Tom cried Maud
It was so funny to see you working away and never guessing who the
cake was for I perfectly trembled every time you opened your mouth
for fear youd ask some question about it That was the reason Polly
preached and I kept talking when she was gone

Very stupid of me but I forgot all about today Suppose we cut it
I dont seem to care for anything else said Tom feeling no appetite
but bound to do justice to that cake if he fell a victim to his
gratitude

I hope the plums wont all be at the bottom said Polly as she rose
to do the honors of the cake by universal appointment

Ive had a good many at the top already you know answered Tom
watching the operation with as much interest as if he had faith in the
omen

Cutting carefully slice after slice fell apart each firm and dark
spicy and rich under the frosty rime above and laying a specially
large piece in one of grandmas quaint little china plates Polly added
the flowers and handed it to Tom with a look that said a good deal
for seeing that he remembered her sermon she was glad to find that her
allegory held good in one sense at least Toms face brightened as he
took it and after an inspection which amused the others very much he
looked up saying with an air of relief Plums all through Im glad
I had a hand in it but Polly deserves the credit and must wear the
posy and turning to her he put the rose into her hair with more
gallantry than taste for a thorn pricked her head the leaves tickled
her ear and the flower was upside down

Fanny laughed at his want of skill but Polly would nt have it altered
and everybody fell to eating cake as if indigestion was one of the lost
arts They had a lively tea and were getting on famously afterward
when two letters were brought for Tom who glanced at one and retired
rather precipitately to his den leaving Maud consumed with curiosity
and the older girls slightly excited for Fan thought she recognized the
handwriting on one and Polly on the other

One half an hour and then another elapsed and Tom did not return Mr
Shaw went out Mrs Shaw retired to her room escorted by Maud and the
two girls sat together wondering if anything dreadful had happened All
of a sudden a voice called Polly and that young lady started out of
her chair as if the sound had been a thunderclap

Do run Im perfectly fainting to know what the matter is said Fan

Youd better go began Polly wishing to obey yet feeling a little
shy

He dont want me besides I could nt say a word for myself if that
letter was from Sydney cried Fanny hustling her friend towards the
door in a great flutter

Polly went without another word but she wore a curiously anxious look
and stopped on the threshold of the den as if a little afraid of its
occupant Tom was sitting in his favorite attitude astride of a chair
with his arms folded and his chin on the top rail not an elegant
posture but the only one in which he said he could think well

Did you want me Tom

Yes Come in please and dont look scared I only want to show you a
present Ive had and ask your advice about accepting it

Why Tom you look as if you had been knocked down exclaimed Polly
forgetting all about herself as she saw his face when he rose and
turned to meet her

I have regularly floored but Im up again and steadier than ever
Just you read that and tell me what you think of it

Tom snatched a letter off the table put it into her hands and began to
walk up and down the little room like a veritable bear in its cage As
Polly read that short note all the color went out of her face and her
eyes began to kindle When she came to the end she stood a minute as
if too indignant to speak then gave the paper a nervous sort of crumple
and dropped it on the floor saying all in one breath I think she is
a mercenary heartless ungrateful girl Thats what I think

Oh the deuce I did nt mean to show that one its the other And
Tom took up a second paper looking half angry half ashamed at his
own mistake I dont care though every one will know tomorrow and
perhaps youll be good enough to keep the girls from bothering me
with questions and gabble he added as if on second thoughts he was
relieved to have the communication made to Polly first

I dont wonder you looked upset If the other letter is as bad Id
better have a chair before I read it said Polly feeling that she
began to tremble with excitement

Its a million times better but it knocked me worse than the other
kindness always does Tom stopped short there and stood a minute
turning the letter about in his hand as if it contained a sweet which
neutralized the bitter in that smaller note and touched him very much
Then he drew up an armchair and beckoning Polly to take it said in
a sober steady tone that surprised her greatly Whenever I was in a
quandary I used to go and consult grandma and she always had something
sensible or comfortable to say to me Shes gone now but somehow
Polly you seem to take her place Would you mind sitting in her chair
and letting me tell you two or three things as Will does

Mind it Polly felt that Tom had paid her the highest and most beautiful
compliment he could have devised She had often longed to do it for
being brought up in the most affectionate and frank relations with her
brothers she had early learned what it takes most women some time to
discover that sex does not make nearly as much difference in hearts and
souls as we fancy Joy and sorrow love and fear life and death
bring so many of the same needs to all that the wonder is we do not
understand each other better but wait till times of tribulation teach
us that human nature is very much the same in men and women Thanks to
this knowledge Polly understood Tom in a way that surprised and won
him She knew that he wanted womanly sympathy and that she could give
it to him because she was not afraid to stretch her hand across the
barrier which our artificial education puts between boys and girls and
to say to him in all good faith If I can help you let me

Ten minutes sooner Polly could have done this almost as easily to Tom as
to Will but in that ten minutes something had happened which made this
difficult Reading that Trix had given Tom back his freedom changed many
things to Polly and caused her to shrink from his confidence because
she felt as if it would be harder now to keep self out of sight for
spite of maiden modesty love and hope would wake and sing at the good
news Slowly she sat down and hesitatingly she said with her eyes on
the ground and a very humble voice Ill do my best but I cant fill
grandmas place or give you any wise good advice I wish I could

Youll do it better than any one else Talk troubles mother father
has enough to think of without any of my worries Fan is a good soul
but she is nt practical and we always get into a snarl if we try to
work together so who have I but my other sister Polly The pleasure
that letter will give you may make up for my boring you

As he spoke Tom laid the other paper in her lap and went off to the
window as if to leave her free to enjoy it unseen but he could not
help a glance now and then and as Pollys face brightened his own
fell

Oh Tom thats a birthday present worth having for its so
beautifully given I dont see how you can refuse it Arthur Sydney is a
real nobleman cried Polly looking up at last with her fact glowing
and her eyes full of delight

So he is I dont know another man living except father who would
have done such a thing or who I could bring myself to take it from Do
you see hes not only paid the confounded debts but has done it in my
name to spare me all he could

I see its like him and I think he must be very happy to be able to
do such a thing

It is an immense weight off my shoulders for some of those men could
nt afford to wait till Id begged borrowed or earned the money
Sydney can wait but he wont long if I know myself You wont take
it as a gift then

Would you

No

Then dont think I will Im a pretty poor affair Polly but Im
not mean enough to do that while Ive got a conscience and a pair of
hands

A rough speech but it pleased Polly better than the smoothest Tom had
ever made in her hearing for something in his face and voice told her
that the friendly act had roused a nobler sentiment than gratitude
making the cancelled obligations of the boy debts of honor to the man

What will you do Tom

Ill tell you may I sit here And Tom took the low footstool that
always stood near grandmas old chair Ive had so many plans in my
head lately that sometimes it seems as if it would split continued
the poor fellow rubbing his tired forehead as if to polish up his
wits Ive thought seriously of going to California Australia or
some outoftheway place where men get rich in a hurry

Oh no cried Polly putting out her hand as it to keep him and then
snatching it back again before he could turn round

It would be hard on mother and the girls I suppose besides I dont
quite like it myself looks as if I shirked and ran away

So it does said Polly decidedly

Well you see I dont seem to find anything to do unless I turn clerk
and I dont think that would suit The fact is I could nt stand
it here where Im known It would be easier to scratch gravel on a
railroad with a gang of Paddies than to sell pins to my friends and
neighbors False pride I dare say but its the truth and theres no
use in dodging

Not a bit and I quite agree with you

Thats comfortable Now Im coming to the point where I specially
want your advice Polly Yesterday I heard you telling Fan about your
brother Ned how well he got on how he liked his business and wanted
Will to come and take some place near him You thought I was reading
but I heard and it struck me that perhaps I could get a chance out West
somewhere What do you think

If you really mean work I know you could answered Polly quickly as
all sorts of plans and projects went sweeping through her mind I wish
you could be with Ned youd get on together Im sure and hed be
so glad to do anything he could Ill write and ask straight away if
you want me to

Suppose you do just for information you know then I shall have
something to go upon I want to have a feasible plan all ready before
I speak to father Theres nothing so convincing to business men as
facts you know

Polly could not help smiling at Toms new tone it seemed so strange
to hear him talking about anything but horses and tailors dancing and
girls She liked it however as much as she did the sober expression of
his face and the way he had lately of swinging his arms about as if he
wanted to do something energetic with them

That will be wise Do you think your father will like this plan

Pretty sure he will Yesterday when I told him I must go at something
right off he said Anything honest Tom and dont forget that your
father began the world as a shopboy You knew that did nt you

Yes he told me the story once and I always liked to hear it because
it was pleasant to see how well he had succeeded

I never did like the story a little bit ashamed Im afraid but
when we talked it over last night it struck me in a new light and I
understood why father took the failure so well and seems so contented
with this poorish place It is only beginning again he says and having
worked his way up once he feels as if he could again I declare to you
Polly that sort of confidence in himself and energy and courage in a
man of his years makes me love and respect the dear old gentleman as I
never did before

Im so glad to hear you say that Tom Ive sometimes thought you did
nt quite appreciate your father any more than he knew how much of a
man you were

Never was till today you know said Tom laughing yet looking as
if he felt the dignity of his one and twenty years Odd is nt it how
people live together ever so long and dont seem to find one another
out till something comes to do it for them Perhaps this smashup was
sent to introduce me to my own father

Theres philosophy for you said Polly smiling even while she felt
as if adversity was going to do more for Tom than years of prosperity

They both sat quiet for a minute Polly in the big chair looking at him
with a new respect in her eyes Tom on the stool near by slowly tearing
up a folded paper he had absently taken from the floor while he talked

Did this surprise you he asked as a little white shower fluttered
from his hands

No

Well it did me for you know as soon as we came to grief I offered to
release Trix from the engagement and she would nt let me continued
Tom as if having begun the subject he wished to explain it
thoroughly

That surprised me said Polly

So it did me for Fan always insisted it was the money and not the
man she cared for Her first answer pleased me very much for I did not
expect it and nothing touches a fellow more than to have a woman stand
by him through thick and thin

She dont seem to have done it

Fan was right Trix only waited to see how bad things really were or
rather her mother did Shes as cool hard and worldly minded an old
soul as I ever saw and Trix is bound to obey She gets round it very
neatly in her note I wont be a burdenwill sacrifice her hopes
and always remain my warm friend but the truth is Tom Shaw rich was
worth making much of but Tom Shaw poor is in the way and may go to the
devil as fast as he likes

Well he is nt going cried Polly defiantly for her wrath burned
hotly against Trix though she blessed her for setting the bondman free

Came within an ace of it muttered Tom to himself adding aloud in
a tone of calm resignation that assured Polly his heart would not
be broken though his engagement was It never rains but it pours
specially in hard times but when a man is down a rap or two more
dont matter much I suppose Its the first blow that hurts most

Glad to see you take the last blow so well There was an ironical
little twang to that speech and Polly could nt help it Tom colored up
and looked hurt for a minute then seemed to right himself with a shrug
and said in his outspoken way To tell the honest truth Polly it was
not a very hard one Ive had a feeling for some time that Trix and I
were not suited to one another and it might be wiser to stop short But
she did not or would not see it and I was not going to back out and
leave her to wear any more willows so here we are I dont bear malice
but hope shell do better and not be disappointed again upon my word
I do

Thats very good of you quite Sydneyesque and noble said Polly
feeling rather ill at ease and wishing she could hide herself behind a
cap and spectacles if she was to play Grandma to this confiding youth

It will be all plain sailing for Syd I fancy observed Tom getting
up as if the little cricket suddenly ceased to be comfortable

I hope so murmured Polly wondering what was coming next

He deserves the very best of everything and I pray the Lord he may get
it added Tom poking the fire in a destructive manner

Polly made no answer fearing to pay too much for she knew Fan had made
no confidant of Tom and she guarded her friends secret as jealously as
her own Youll write to Ned tomorrow will you Ill take anything
hes got for I want to be off said Tom casting down the poker
and turning round with a resolute air which was lost on Polly who sat
twirling the rose that had fallen into her lap

Ill write tonight Would you like me to tell the girls about Trix
and Sydney she asked as she rose feeling that the council was over

I wish you would I dont know how to thank you for all youve done
for me I wish to heaven I did said Tom holding out his hand with a
look that Polly thought a great deal too grateful for the little she had
done

As she gave him her hand and looked up at him with those confiding eyes
of hers Toms gratitude seemed to fly to his head for without the
slightest warning he stooped down and kissed her a proceeding which
startled Polly so that he recovered himself at once and retreated into
his den with the incoherent apology I beg pardon could nt help it
grandma always let me on my birthday

While Polly took refuge up stairs forgetting all about Fan as she sat
in the dark with her face hidden wondering why she was nt very angry
and resolving never again to indulge in the delightful but dangerous
pastime of playing grandmother




CHAPTER XVIII THE WOMAN WHO DID NOT DARE


POLLY wrote enthusiastically Ned answered satisfactorily and after
much corresponding talking and planning it was decided that Tom
should go West Never mind what the business was it suffices to say
that it was a good beginning for a young man like Tom who having been
born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceited city
in New England needed just the healthy hearty social influences of
the West to widen his views and make a man of him

Of course there was much lamentation among the women but every one felt
it was the best thing for him so while they sighed they sewed packed
visions of a brilliant future away with his new pocket handkerchiefs
and rejoiced that the way was open before him even in the act of
bedewing his boots with tears Sydney stood by him to the last like
a man and a brother which expression of Toms gave Fanny infinite
satisfaction and Will felt entirely consoled for Neds disappointment
at his refusal to go and join him since Tom was to take the place Ned
had kept for him

Fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that
there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people
worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were
not bottled up in their respective hearts But in spite of the silence
the work and the hurry I think they came to know one another better
in that busy little space of time than in all the years that had gone
before for the best and bravest in each was up and stirring and
the small house was as full of the magnetism of love and friendship
selfsacrifice and enthusiasm as the world outside was full of spring
sunshine and enchantment Pity that the end should come so soon but the
hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind
though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim
because of the partings that must be

Tom was off to the West Polly went home for the summer Maud was
taken to the seaside with Belle and Fanny left alone to wrestle with
housekeeping help and heartache If it had not been for two things
I fear she never would have stood a summer in town but Sydney often
called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with
Polly beguiled the long days Tom wrote once a week to his mother but
the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do
tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear Fanny
forwarded her bits of news to Polly Polly sent back all the extracts
from Neds letters concerning Tom and by putting the two reports
together they gained the comfortable assurance that Tom was well in
good spirits hard at work and intent on coming out strong in spite of
all obstacles

Polly had a quiet summer at home resting and getting ready in mind and
body for another winters work for in the autumn she tried her plan
again to the satisfaction of her pupils and the great joy of her
friends She never said much of herself in her letters and Fannys
first exclamation when they met again was an anxious Why Polly dear
Have you been sick and never told me

No Im only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather
makes me just a trifle blue I shall soon brighten up when I get to my
work again answered Polly bustling about to put away her things

You dont look a bit natural What have you been doing to your precious
little self persisted Fanny troubled by the change yet finding it
hard to say wherein it lay

Polly did not look sick though her cheeks were thinner and her color
paler than formerly but she seemed spiritless and there was a tired
look in her eyes that went to Fannys heart

Im all right enough as youll see when Im in order Im proper
glad to find you looking so well and happy Does all go smoothly Fan
asked Polly beginning to brush her hair industriously

Answer me one question first said Fanny looking as if a sudden fear
had come over her Tell me truly have you never repented of your hint
to Sydney

Never cried Polly throwing back the brown veil behind which she had
half hidden her face at first

On your honor as an honest girl

On my honor as anything you please Why do you suspect me of it
demanded Polly almost angrily

Because something is wrong with you Its no use to deny it for you
ve got the look I used to see in that very glass on my own face when I
thought he cared for you Forgive me Polly but I cant help saying it
for it is there and I want to be as true to you as you were to me if I
can

Fannys face was full of agitation and she spoke fast and frankly for
she was trying to be generous and found it very hard Polly understood
now and put her fear at rest by saying almost passionately I tell you
I dont love him If he was the only man in the world I would nt marry
him because I dont want to

The last three words were added in a different tone for Polly had
checked herself there with a halffrightened look and turned away to
hide her face behind her hair again

Then if its not him its some one else Youve got a secret
Polly and I should think you might tell it as you know mine said
Fanny unable to rest till everything was told for Pollys manner
troubled her

There was no answer to her question but she was satisfied and putting
her arm round her friend she said in her most persuasive tone My
precious Polly do I know him

You have seen him

And is he very wise good and splendid dear

No

He ought to be if you love him I hope he is nt bad cried Fan
anxiously still holding Polly who kept her head obstinately turned

Im suited thats enough

Oh please just tell me one thing more Dont he love back again

No Now dont say another word I cant bear it and Polly drew
herself away as she spoke in a desperate sort of tone

I wont but now Im not afraid to tell you that I think I hope I
do believe that Sydney cares a little for me Hes been very kind to us
all and lately he has seemed to like to see me always when he comes
and miss me if Im gone I did nt dare to hope anything till Papa
observed something in his manner and teased me about it I try not to
deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness
for me

Thank heaven for that cried Polly with the heartiest satisfaction in
her voice Now come and tell me all about it she added sitting down
on the couch with the air of one who has escaped a great peril

Ive got some notes and things I want to ask your opinion about if
they really mean anything you know said Fanny getting out a bundle
of papers from the inmost recesses of her desk Theres a photograph
of Tom came in his last letter Good is nt it He looks older but
thats the beard and the rough coat I suppose Dear old fellow he is
doing so well I really begin to feel quite proud of him

Fan tossed her the photograph and went on rummaging for a certain note
She did not see Polly catch up the picture and look at it with hungry
eyes but she did hear something in the low tone in which Polly said
It dont do him justice and glancing over her shoulder Fans quick
eye caught a glimpse of the truth though Polly was half turned away
from her Without stopping to think Fan dropped her letters took Polly
by the shoulders and cried in a tone full of astonishment Polly is
it Tom

Poor Polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
None were needed her telltale face answered for her as well as the
impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish
ostrich when the hunters are after it

Oh Polly I am so glad I never thought of it you are so good and he
s such a wild boy I cant believe it but it is so dear of you to care
for him

Could nt help it tried not to but it was so hard you know Fan you
know said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion
which Tom had once condemned

The last words and the appealing hand outstretched to her told Fanny
the secret of her friends tender sympathy for her own love troubles
and seemed so pathetic that she took Polly in her arms and cried over
her in the fond foolish way girls have of doing when their hearts are
full and tears can say more than tongues The silence never lasts long
however for the feminine desire to talk it over usually gets the
better of the deepest emotion So presently the girls were hard at
it Polly very humble and downcast Fanny excited and overflowing with
curiosity and delight

Really my sister You dear thing how heavenly that will be she
cried

It never will be answered Polly in a tone of calm despair

What will prevent it

Maria Bailey was the tragic reply

What do you mean Is she the Western girl She shant have Tom Ill
kill her first

Too late let me tell you is that door shut and Maud safe

Fanny reconnoitered and returning listened breathlessly while Polly
poured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul

Has nt he mentioned Maria in his letters

Once or twice but sort of jokingly and I thought it was only some
little flirtation He cant have time for much of that fun hes so
busy

Ned writes good gossipy letters I taught him how and he tells me all
thats going on When hed spoken of this girl several times they
board with her mother you know I asked about her quite carelessly
and he told me she was pretty good and well educated and he thought
Tom was rather smitten That was a blow for you see Fan since Trix
broke the engagement and it was nt wrong to think of Tom I let myself
hope just a little and was so happy Now I must give it up and now I
see how much I hoped and what a dreadful loss its going to be

Two great tears rolled down Pollys cheeks and Fanny wiped them away
feeling an intense desire to go West by the next train wither Maria
Bailey with a single look and bring Tom back as a gift to Polly

It was so stupid of me not to guess before But you see Tom always
seems so like a boy and you are more womanly for your age than any girl
I know so I never thought of your caring for him in that way I knew
you were very good to him you are to every one my precious and I knew
that he was fond of you as he is of me fonder if anything because he
thinks you are perfect but still I never dreamed of his loving you as
more than a dear friend

He does nt sighed Polly

Well he ought and if I could get hold of him he should

Polly clutched Fan at that and held her tight saying sternly If you
ever breathe a word drop a hint look a look that will tell him or any
one else about me Ill yes as sure as my name is Mary Milton Ill
proclaim from the housetops that you like Ar Polly got no further
for Fans hand was on her mouth and Fans alarmed voice vehemently
protested I wont I promise solemnly Ill never say a word to a
mortal creature Dont be so fierce Polly you quite frighten me

Its bad enough to love some one who dont love you but to have them
told of it is perfectly awful It makes me wild just to think of it Oh
Fan Im getting so illtempered and envious and wicked I dont know
what will happen to me

Im not afraid for you my dear and I do believe things will go
right because you are so good to every one How Tom could help adoring
you I dont see I know he would if he had stayed at home longer after
he got rid of Trix It would be the making of him but though he is my
brother I dont think hes good enough for you Polly and I dont
quite see how you can care for him so much when you might have had a
person so infinitely superior

I dont want asuperior person hed tire me if he was like A S
Besides I do think Tom is superior to him in many things Well you
need nt stare I know he is or will be Hes so different and very
young and has lots of faults I know but I like him all the better for
it and hes honest and brave and has got a big warm heart and Id
rather have him care for me than the wisest best most accomplished man
in the world simply because I love him

If Tom could only have seen Pollys face when she said that It was so
tender earnest and defiant that Fanny forgot the defence of her own
lover in admiration of Pollys loyalty to hers for this faithful all
absorbing love was a new revelation to Fanny who was used to hearing
her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their
respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men
discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not
afford to marry She had thought her love for Sydney very romantic
because she did not really care whether he was rich or poor though she
never dared to say so even to Polly for fear of being laughed at
She began to see now what true love was and to feel that the sentiment
which she could not conquer was a treasure to be accepted with
reverence and cherished with devotion

I dont know when I began to love Tom but I found out that I did last
winter and was as much surprised as you are continued Polly as if
glad to unburden her heart I did nt approve of him at all I
thought he was extravagant reckless and dandified I was very much
disappointed when he chose Trix and the more I thought and saw of it
the worse I felt for Tom was too good for her and I hated to see her
do so little for him when she might have done so much because he is
one of the men who can be led by their affections and the woman he
marries can make or mar him

Thats true cried Fan as Polly paused to look at the picture which
appeared to regard her with a grave steady look which seemed rather to
belie her assertions

I dont mean that hes weak or bad If he was I should hate him but
he does need some one to love him very much and make him happy as
a good woman best knows how said Polly as if answering the mute
language of Toms face

I hope Maria Bailey is all he thinks her she added softly for I
could nt bear to have him disappointed again

I dare say he dont care a fig for her and you are only borrowing
trouble What do you say Ned answered when you asked about this
inconvenient girl said Fanny turning hopeful all at once

Polly repeated it and added I asked him in another letter if he did
nt admire Miss B as much as Tom and he wrote back that she wasa
nice girl but he had no time for nonsense and I need nt get my white
kids ready for some years yet unless to dance at Toms wedding Since
then he has nt mentioned Maria so I was sure there was something
serious going on and being in Toms confidence he kept quiet

It does look bad Suppose I say a word to Tom just inquire after his
heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if
there is anything to tell Im willing but you must let me see the
letter I cant trust you not to hint or say too much

You shall Ill keep my promise in spite of everything but it will be
hard to see things going wrong when a word would set it right

You know what will happen if you do and Polly looked so threatening
that Fan trembled before her discovering that the gentlest girls when
roused are more impressive than any shrew for even turtle doves peck
gallantly to defend their nests

If it is true about Maria what shall we do said Fanny after a pause

Bear it People always do bear things somehow answered Polly
looking as if sentence had been passed upon her

But if it is nt cried Fan unable to endure the sight

Then I shall wait And Pollys face changed so beautifully that Fan
hugged her on the spot fervently wishing that Maria Bailey never had
been born

Then the conversation turned to lover number two and after a long
confabulation Polly gave it as her firm belief that A S had forgotten
M M and was rapidly finding consolation in the regard of F S With
this satisfactory decision the council ended after the ratification of a
Loyal League by which the friends pledged themselves to stand staunchly
by one another through the trials of the coming year

It was a very different winter from the last for both the girls Fanny
applied herself to her duties with redoubled ardor for A S was a
domestic man and admired housewifely accomplishments If Fanny wanted
to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she
certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many
failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became
a most attractive place to Mr Sydney at least for he was more the
housefriend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of
fortune made no difference to him

Fanny had been afraid that Pollys return might endanger her hopes but
Sydney met Polly with the old friendliness and very soon convinced her
that the nipping in the bud process had been effectual for being taken
early the sprouting affection had died easy and left room for an older
friendship to blossom into a happier love

Fanny seemed glad of this and Polly soon set her heart at rest by
proving that she had no wish to try her power She kept much at home
when the days work was done finding it pleasanter to sit dreaming over
book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the Shaws

Fan dont need me and Sydney dont care whether I come or not so I
ll keep out of the way she would say as if to excuse her seeming
indolence

Polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her
saw and wondered at it most Will got very anxious she was so quiet
pale and spiritless and distracted poor Polly by his affectionate
stupidity till she completed his bewilderment by getting cross and
scolding him So he consoled himself with Maud who now being in her
teens assumed dignified airs and ordered him about in a style that
afforded him continued amusement and employment

Western news continued vague for Fans general inquiries produced only
provokingly unsatisfactory replies from Tom who sang the praises of
the beautiful Miss Bailey and professed to be consumed by a hopeless
passion for somebody in such halfcomic halftragic terms that the
girls could not decide whether it was all that boys mischief or only
a cloak to hide the dreadful truth

Well have it out of him when he comes home in the spring said Fanny
to Polly as they compared the letters of their brothers and agreed
that men were the most uncommunicative and provoking animals under
the sun For Ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole
Bailey question and left them in utter darkness

Hunger of any sort is a hard thing to bear especially when the sufferer
has a youthful appetite and Polly was kept on such a short allowance of
happiness for six months that she got quite thin and interesting and
often when she saw how big her eyes were getting and how plainly the
veins on her temples showed indulged the pensive thought that perhaps
spring dandelions might blossom oer her grave She had no intention of
dying till Toms visit was over however and as the time drew near
she went through such alternations of hope and fear and lived in such a
state of feverish excitement that spirits and color came back and she
saw that the interesting pallor she had counted on would be an entire
failure

May came at last and with it a burst of sunshine which cheered even
poor Pollys muchenduring heart Fanny came walking in upon her one
day looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly
knew how to tell them

Prepare yourself somebody is engaged she said in a solemn tone
that made Polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow No
dont look like that my poor dear it is nt Tom its I

Of course there was a rapture followed by one of the deliciously
confidential talks which bosom friends enjoy interspersed with tears
and kisses smiles and sighs

Oh Polly though Ive waited and hoped so long I could nt believe it
when it came and dont deserve it but I will for the knowledge that
he loves me seems to make everything possible said Fanny with an
expression which made her really beautiful for the first time in her
life

You happy girl sighed Polly then smiled and added I think you
deserve all thats come to you for you have truly tried to be worthy
of it and whether it ever came or not that would have been a thing to
be proud of

He says that is what made him love me answered Fanny never calling
her lover by his name but making the little personal pronoun a very
sweet word by the tone in which she uttered it He was disappointed in
me last year he told me but you said good things about me and though
he did nt care much then yet when he lost you and came back to me he
found that you were not altogether mistaken and he has watched me
all this winter learning to respect and love me better every day Oh
Polly when he said that I could nt bear it because in spite of all
my trying Im still so weak and poor and silly

We dont think so and I know youll be all he hopes to find you for
hes just the husband you ought to have

Thank you all the more then for not keeping him yourself said
Fanny laughing the old blithe laugh again

That was only a slight aberration of his he knew better all the time
It was your white cloak and my idiotic behavior the night we went to the
opera that put the idea into his head said Polly feeling as if the
events of that evening had happened some twenty years ago when she was
a giddy young thing fond of gay bonnets and girlish pranks

Im not going to tell Tom a word about it but keep it for a surprise
till he comes He will be here next week and then well have a
grand clearing up of mysteries said Fan evidently feeling that the
millennium was at hand

Perhaps said Polly as her heart fluttered and then sunk for this
was a case where she could do nothing but hope and keep her hands busy
with Wills new set of shirts

There is a good deal more of this sort of silent suffering than the
world suspects for the women who dare are few the women who stand
and wait are many But if workbaskets were gifted with powers of
speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read
For women often sew the tragedy or comedy of life into their work as
they sit apparently safe and serene at home yet are thinking deeply
living whole hearthistories and praying fervent prayers while they
embroider pretty trifles or do the weekly mending




CHAPTER XIX TOMS SUCCESS


 Come Philander let us be a marching
 Every one his true love a searching

WOULD be the most appropriate motto for this chapter because
intimidated by the threats denunciations and complaints showered upon
me in consequence of taking the liberty to end a certain story as I
liked I now yield to the amiable desire of giving satisfaction and
at the risk of outraging all the unities intend to pair off everybody I
can lay my hands on

Occasionally a matrimonial epidemic appears especially toward spring
devastating society thinning the ranks of bachelordom and leaving
mothers lamenting for their fairest daughters That spring the disease
broke out with great violence in the Shaw circle causing paternal heads
much bewilderment as one case after another appeared with alarming
rapidity Fanny as we have seen was stricken first and hardly had she
been carried safely through the crisis when Tom returned to swell the
list of victims As Fanny was out a good deal with her Arthur who was
sure that exercise was necessary for the convalescent Polly went every
day to see Mrs Shaw who found herself lonely though much better than
usual for the engagement had a finer effect upon her constitution than
any tonic she ever tried Some three days after Fans joyful call Polly
was startled on entering the Shaws door by Maud who came tumbling
down stairs sending an avalanche of words before her Hes come
before he said he should to surprise us Hes up in mammas room
and was just saying Hows Polly when I heard you come in your
creepmouse way and you must go right up He looks so funny with
whiskers but hes ever so nice real big and brown and he swung me
right up when he kissed me Never mind your bonnet I cant wait

And pouncing upon Polly Maud dragged her away like a captured ship
towed by a noisy little steamtug

The sooner its over the better for me was the only thought Polly
had time for before she plunged into the room above propelled by Maud
who cried triumphantly There he is Aint he splendid

For a minute everything danced before Pollys eyes as a hand shook
hers warmly and a gruffish voice said heartily How are you Polly
Then she slipped into a chair beside Mrs Shaw hoping that her reply
had been all right and proper for she had not the least idea what she
said

Things got steady again directly and while Maud expatiated on the great
surprise Polly ventured to look at Tom feeling glad that her back
was toward the light and his was not It was not a large room and Tom
seemed to fill it entirely not that he had grown so very much except
broader in the shoulders but there was a brisk genial freeandeasy
air about him suggestive of a stirring outofdoor life with people
who kept their eyes wide open and were not very particular what they
did with their arms and legs The roughandready travelling suit stout
boots brown face and manly beard changed him so much that Polly
could find scarcely a trace of elegant Tom Shaw in the heartylooking
young man who stood with one foot on a chair while he talked business
to his father in a sensible way which delighted the old gentleman
Polly liked the change immensely and sat listening to the state of
Western trade with as much interest as if it had been the most thrilling
romance for as he talked Tom kept looking at her with a nod or a
smile so like old times that for a little while she forgot Maria
Bailey and was in bliss

By and by Fanny came flying in and gave Tom a greater surprise than his
had been He had not the least suspicion of what had been going on at
home for Fan had said to herself with girlish malice If he dont
choose to tell me his secrets Im not going to tell mine and had
said nothing about Sydney except an occasional allusion to his
being often there and very kind Therefore when she announced her
engagement Tom looked so staggered for a minute that Fan thought he
did nt like it but after the first surprise passed he showed such an
affectionate satisfaction that she was both touched and flattered

What do you think of this performance asked Tom wheeling round to
Polly who still sat by Mrs Shaw in the shadow of the bedcurtains

I like it very much she said in such a hearty tone that Tom could
not doubt the genuineness of her pleasure

Glad of that Hope youll be as well pleased with another engagement
thats coming out before long and with an odd laugh Tom carried
Sydney off to his den leaving the girls to telegraph to one another the
awful message It is Maria Bailey

How she managed to get through that evening Polly never knew yet it
was not a long one for at eight oclock she slipped out of the room
meaning to run home alone and not compel any one to serve as escort
But she did not succeed for as she stood warming her rubbers at the
diningroom fire wondering pensively as she did so if Maria Bailey
had small feet and if Tom ever put her rubbers on for her the
little overshoes were taken out of her hands and Toms voice said
reproachfully Did you really mean to run away and not let me go home
with you

Im not afraid I did nt want to take you away began Polly
secretly hoping that she did nt look too pleased

But I like to be taken away Why its a whole year since I went home
with you do you remember that said Tom flapping the rubbers about
without any signs of haste

Does it seem long

Everlasting

Polly meant to say that quite easily and smile incredulously at his
answer but in spite of the coquettish little rosecolored hood she
wore and which she knew was very becoming she did not look or speak
gayly and Tom saw something in the altered face that made him say
hastily Im afraid youve been doing too much this winter you look
tired out Polly

Oh no it suits me to be very busy and she began to drag on her
gloves as if to prove it

But it does nt suit me to have you get thin and pale you know

Polly looked up to thank him but never did for there was something
deeper than gratitude in the honest blue eyes that could not hide
the truth entirely Tom saw it flushed all over his brown face and
dropping the rubbers with a crash took her hands saying in his old
impetuous way Polly I want to tell you something

Yes I know weve been expecting it I hope youll be very happy
Tom and Polly shook his hands with a smile that was more pathetic than
a flood of tears

What cried Tom looking as if he thought she had lost her mind

Ned told us all about her he thought it would be so and when you
spoke of another engagement we knew you meant your own

But I did nt Neds the man he told me to tell you Its just
settled

Is it Maria cried Polly holding on to a chair as if to be prepared
for anything

Of course Who else should it be

He did nt say you talked about her most and so we thought stammered
Polly falling into a sudden flutter

That I was in love Well I am but not with her

Oh and Polly caught her breath as if a dash of cold water had fallen
on her for the more in earnest Tom grew the blunter he became

Do you want to know the name of the girl Ive loved for more than a
year Well its Polly As he spoke Tom stretched out his arms to
her with the sort of mute eloquence that cannot be resisted and Polly
went straight into them without a word

Never mind what happened for a little bit Love scenes if genuine are
indescribable for to those who have enacted them the most elaborate
description seems tame and to those who have not the simplest picture
seems overdone So romancers had better let imagination paint for them
that which is above all art and leave their lovers to themselves during
the happiest minutes of their lives

Before long Tom and Polly were sitting side by side enjoying the
blissful state of mind which usually follows the first step out of our
workaday world into the glorified region wherein lovers rapturously
exist for a month or two Tom just sat and looked at Polly as if he
found it difficult to believe that the winter of his discontent had
ended in this glorious spring But Polly being a true woman asked
questions even while she laughed and cried for joy

Now Tom how could I know you loved me when you went away and never
said a word she began in a tenderly reproachful tone thinking of the
hard year she had spent

And how could I have the courage to say a word when I had nothing on
the face of the earth to offer you but my worthless self answered Tom
warmly

That was all I wanted whispered Polly in a tone which caused him to
feel that the race of angels was not entirely extinct

Ive always been fond of you my Polly but I never realized how fond
till just before I went away I was nt free you know and besides I
had a strong impression that you liked Sydney in spite of the damper
which Fan hinted you gave him last winter Hes such a capital fellow
I really dont see how you could help it

It is strange I dont understand it myself but women are queer
creatures and theres no accounting for their tastes said Polly
with a sly look which Tom fully appreciated

You were so good to me those last days that I came very near speaking
out but could nt bear to seem to be offering you a poor disgraced
sort of fellow whom Trix would nt have and no one seemed to think
worth much No I said to myself Polly ought to have the best if
Syd can get her let him and I wont say a word Ill try to be better
worthy her friendship anyway and perhaps when Ive proved that I
can do something and am not ashamed to work then if Polly is free I
shant be afraid to try my chance So I held my tongue worked like a
horse satisfied myself and others that I could get my living honestly
and then came home to see if there was any hope for me

And I was waiting for you all the time said a soft voice close to his
shoulder for Polly was much touched by Toms manly efforts to deserve
her

I did nt mean to do it the first minute but look about me a little
and be sure Syd was all right But Fans news settled that point and
just now the look in my Pollys face settled the other I could nt wait
another minute or let you either and I could nt help stretching out
my arms to my little wife God bless her though I know I dont deserve
her

Toms voice got lower and lower as he spoke and his face was full of
an emotion of which he need not be ashamed for a very sincere love
ennobled him making him humble where a shallower affection would have
been proud of its success Polly understood this and found the honest
hearty speech of her lover more eloquent than poetry itself Her hand
stole up to his cheek and she leaned her own confidingly against the
rough coat as she said in her frank simple way Tom dear dont say
that as if I was the best girl in the world Ive got ever so many
faults and I want you to know them all and help me cure them as you
have your own Waiting has not done us any harm and I love you all the
better for your trial But Im afraid your year has been harder than
mine you look so much older and graver than when you went away You
never would complain but Ive had a feeling that you were going
through a good deal more than any of us guessed

Pretty tough work at first I own It was all so new and strange I
m afraid I should nt have stood it if it had not been for Ned Hed
laugh and say Pooh if he heard me say it but its true nevertheless
that hes a grand fellow and helped me through the first six months
like a well a brother as he is There was no reason why he should go
out of his way to back up a shiftless party like me yet he did and
made many things easy and safe that would have been confoundedly hard
and dangerous if Id been left to myself The only way I can explain it
is that its a family trait and as natural to the brother as it is to
the sister

Its a Shaw trait to do the same But tell me about Maria is Ned
really engaged to her

Very much so youll get a letter full of raptures tomorrow he had
nt time to send by me I came off in such a hurry Maria is a sensible
pretty girl and Ned will be a happy old fellow

Why did you let us think it was you

I only teased Fan a little I did like Maria for she reminded me of
you sometimes and was such a kind cosy little woman I could nt help
enjoying her society after a hard days work But Ned got jealous and
then I knew that he was in earnest so I left him a clear field and
promised not to breathe a word to any one till he had got a Yes or No
from his Maria

I wish Id known it sighed Polly People in love always do such
stupid things

So they do for neither you nor Fan gave us poor fellows the least hint
about Syd and there Ive been having all sorts of scares about you

Serves us right brothers and sisters should nt have secrets from each
other

We never will again Did you miss me very much

Yes Tom very very much

My patient little Polly

Did you really care for me before you went

See if I did nt and with great pride Tom produced a portly
pocketbook stuffed with businesslike documents of a most imposing
appearance opened a private compartment and took out a wornlooking
paper unfolded it carefully and displayed a small brown object which
gave out a faint fragrance

Thats the rose you put in the birthday cake and next week well
have a fresh one in another jolly little cake which youll make me you
left it on the floor of my den the night we talked there and Ive kept
it ever since Theres love and romance for you

Polly touched the little relic treasured for a year and smiled to read
the words My Pollys rose scribbled under the crumbling leaves

I did nt know you could be so sentimental she said looking so
pleased that he did not regret confessing his folly

I never was till I loved you my dear and Im not very bad yet for I
dont wear my posy next my heart but where I can see it every day and
so never forget for whom I am working Should nt wonder if that bit
of nonsense had kept me economical honest and hard at it for I never
opened my pocketbook that I did nt think of you

Thats lovely Tom and Polly found it so touching that she felt for
her handkerchief but Tom took it away and made her laugh instead of
cry by saying in a wheedlesome tone I dont believe you did as much
for all your romance Did you now

If you wont laugh Ill show you my treasures I began first and I
ve worn them longest

As she spoke Polly drew out the old locket opened it and showed the
picture Tom gave her in the bag of peanuts cut small and fitted in on
one side on the other was a curl of reddish hair and a black button How
Tom laughed when he saw them

You dont mean youve kept that frightful guy of a boy all this time
Polly Polly you are the most faithfulloveress as Maud says that
was ever known

Dont flatter yourself that Ive worn it all these years sir I only
put it in last spring because I did nt dare to ask for one of the new
ones The button came off the old coat you insisted on wearing after the
failure as if it was your duty to look as shabby as possible and the
curl I stole from Maud Are nt we silly

He did not seem to think so and after a short pause for refreshments
Polly turned serious and said anxiously When must you go back to your
hard work

In a week or two but it wont seem drudgery now for youll write
every day and I shall feel that Im working to get a home for you
That will give me a fortymanpower and Ill pay up my debts and get a
good start and then Ned and I will be married and go into partnership
and well all be the happiest busiest people in the West

It sounds delightful but wont it take a long time Tom

Only a few years and we need nt wait a minute after Syd is paid if
you dont mind beginning rather low down Polly

Id rather work up with you than sit idle while you toil away all
alone Thats the way father and mother did and I think they were very
happy in spite of the poverty and hard work

Then well do it by another year for I must get more salary before I
take you away from a good home here I wish oh Polly how I wish I had
a half of the money Ive wasted to make you comfortable now

Never mind I dont want it Id rather have less and know you earned
it all yourself cried Polly as Tom struck his hand on his knee with
an acute pang of regret at the power he had lost

Its like you to say it and I wont waste any words bewailing myself
because I was a fool We will work up together my brave Polly and you
shall yet be proud of your husband though he ispoor Tom Shaw

She was as sure of that as if an oracle had foretold it and was not
deceived for the loving heart that had always seen believed and
tried to strengthen all good impulses in Tom was well repaid for its
instinctive trust by the happiness of the years to come

Yes she said hopefully I know you will succeed for the best thing
a man can have is work with a purpose in it and the will to do it
heartily

There is one better thing Polly answered Tom turning her face up a
little that he might see his inspiration shining in her eyes

What is it dear

A good woman to love and help him all his life as you will me please
God

Even though she is oldfashioned whispered Polly with happy eyes
the brighter for their tears as she looked up at the young man who
through her had caught a glimpse of the truest success and was not
ashamed to owe it to love and labor two beautiful old fashions that
began long ago with the first pair in Eden

Lest any of my young readers who have honored Maud with their interest
should suffer the pangs of unsatisfied curiosity as to her future I
will add for their benefit that she did not marry Will but remained a
busy lively spinster all her days and kept house for her father in the
most delightful manner

Wills ministerial dream came to pass in the course of time however
and a gentle brighteyed lady ruled over the parsonage whom the
reverend William called his little Jane

Farther into futurity even this rash pen dares not proceed but pauses
here concluding in the words of the dear old fairy tales And so they
were married and all lived happily till they died
