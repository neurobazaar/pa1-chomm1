THE BESETMENT OF KURT LIEDERS


A SILVER rime glistened all down the street

There was a drabble of dead leaves on the sidewalk which was of wood
and on the roadway which was of macadam and stiff mud The wind blew
sharply for it was a December day and only six in the morning Nor were
the houses high enough to furnish any independent bulwark they were
low wooden dwellings the tallest a bare two stories in height the
majority only one story But they were in good painting and repair
and most of them had a homely gayety of geraniums or bouvardias in
the windows The house on the corner was the tall house It occupied a
larger yard than its neighbors and there were lace curtains tied with
blue ribbons for the windows in the right hand front room The door of
this house swung back with a crash and a woman darted out She ran at
the top of her speed to the little yellow house farther down the street
Her blue calico gown clung about her stout figure and fluttered behind
her revealing her blue woollen stockings and felt slippers Her gray
head was bare As she ran tears rolled down her cheeks and she wrung her
hands

Oh Oh Oh Oh lieber Herr Je One near would have heard her sob in
too distracted agitation to heed the motorneer of the passing streetcar
who stared after her at the risk of his car or the tousled heads behind
a few curtains She did not stop until she almost fell against the door
of the yellow house Her frantic knocking was answered by a young woman
in a light and artless costume of a quilted petticoat and a red flannel
sack

Oh gracious goodness Mrs Lieders cried she

Thekla Lieders rather staggered than walked into the room and fell back
on the black haircloth sofa

There there there said the young woman while she patted the broad
shoulders heaving between sobs and short breath what is it The house
aint afire

Oh no oh Mrs Olsen he has done it again She wailed in sobs like
a child

Done it Done what exclaimed Mrs Olsen then her face paled Oh my
gracious you DONT mean hes killed himself

Yes hes killed himself again

And hes dead asked the other in an awed tone

Mrs Lieders gulped down her tears Oh not so bad as that I cut him
down he was up in the garret and I sussuspected him and I run up
andoh he was there a choking and he was so mad He swore at me
andhe kicked me when II says Kurt what are you doing of Hold
on till I git a knife I saysfor his hands was just dangling at his
side and he says nottings cause he couldnt he was most gone and I
knowed I wouldnt have time to git no knife but I saw it was a rope was
pretty bad worn and soso I just run and jumped and ketched it in my
hands and being Im so fleshy it couldnt stand no more and it broke
And oh hehe kicked me when I was try to come near to git the rope
off his neck and so soon like he could git his breath he swore at
me

And you a helping of him Just listen to that cried the hearer
indignantly

So I come here for to git you and Mr Olsen to help me git him down
stairs cause he is too heavy for me to lift and he is so mad he wont
walk down himself

Yes yes of course Ill call Carl Carl dost thou hear come But
did you dare to leave him Mrs Lieders Part of the time she spoke
in English part of the time in her own tongue gliding from one to
another and neither party observing the transition

Mrs Lieders wiped her eyes saying Oh yes Danke schon I aint
afraid cause I tied him with the rope righd good so he dont got no
chance to move He was make faces at me all the time I tied him At the
remembrance the tears welled anew

Mrs Olsen a little bright tinted woman with a nose too small for her
big blue eyes and chubby cheeks quivered with indignant sympathy

Well I did nefer hear of sooch a mean acting man seemed to her the
most natural expression but the wife fired at once

No he is not a mean man she cried no Freda Olsen he is not a
mean man at all There aint nowhere a better man than my man and Carl
Olsen he knows that Kurt he always buys a whole ham and a whole
barrel of flour and never less than a dollar of sugar at a time And he
never gits drunk nor he never gives me any bad talk It was only he got
this wanting to kill himself on him sometimes

Well I guess Ill go put on my things said Mrs Olsen wisely
declining to defend her position You set right still and warm
yourself and well be back in a minute

Indeed it was hardly more than that time before both Carl Olsen who
worked in the same furniture factory as Kurt Lieders and was a comely
and afterwitted giant appeared with Mrs Olsen ready for the street

He nodded at Mrs Lieders and made a gurgling noise in his throat
expected to convey sympathy Then he coughed and said that he was
ready and they started

Feeling further expression demanded Mrs Olsen asked How many times
has he done it Mrs Lieders

Mrs Lieders was trotting along her anxious eyes on the house in the
distance especially on the garret windows Three times she answered
not removing her eyes onct he tooked Rough on Rats and I found it out
and I put some apple butter in the place of it and he kept wondering
and wondering how he didnt feel notings and after awhile I got him off
the notion that time He wasnt mad at me he just said Well I do it
some other time You see but he promised to wait till I got the spring
house cleaning over so he could shake the carpets for me and by and
by he got feeling better He was mad at the boss and that made him
feel bad The next time it was the same that time he jumped into the
cistern

Yes I know said Olsen with a half grin I pulled him out

It was the razor he wanted the wife continued and when he come home
and says he was going to leave the shop and he aint never going back
there and gets out his razor and sharps it I knowed what that meant
and I told him I got to have some bluing and wouldnt he go and get it
and he says You wont git another husband run so free on your errands
Thekla and I says I dont want none and when he was gone I hid the
razor and he couldnt find it but that didnt mad him he didnt say
notings and when I went to git the supper he walked out in the yard and
jumped into the cistern and I heard the splash and looked in and there
he was trying to git his head under and I called For the Lords sake
papa For the Lords sake just like that And I fished for him with
the pole that stood there and he was sorry and caught hold of it and
give in and I rested the pole agin the side cause I wasnt strong
enough to hist him out and he held on whilest I run for help

And I got the ladder and he clum out said the giant with another grin
of recollection he was awful wet

That was a month ago said the wife solemnly

He sharped the razor onct said Mrs Lieders but he said it was
for to shave him and I got him to promise to let the barber shave him
sometime instead Here Mrs Olsen you go righd in the door aint
locked

By this time they were at the house door They passed in and ascended
the stairs to the second story then climbed a narrow ladderlike
flight to the garret Involuntarily they had paused to listen at the
foot of the stairs but it was very quiet not a sound of movement not
so much as the sigh of a man breathing The wife turned pale and put
both her shaking hands on her heart

Guess hes trying to scare us by keeping quiet said Olsen
cheerfully and he stumbled up the stairs in advance Thunder he
exclaimed on the last stair well we aint any too quick

In fact Carl had nearly fallen over the master of the house that
enterprising selfdestroyer having contrived pinioned as he was to
roll over to the very brink of the stair well with the plain intent to
break his neck by plunging headlong

In the dim light all that they could see was a small old man whose
white hair was strung in wisps over his purple face whose deep set eyes
glared like the eyes of a rat in a trap and whose very elbows and knees
expressed in their cramps the fury of an outraged soul When he saw the
newcomers he shut his eyes and his jaws

Well Mr Lieders said Olsen mildly I guess you better git
downstairs Kin I help you up

No said Lieders

Will I give you an arm to lean on

No

Wont you go at all Mr Lieders

No

Olsen shook his head I hate to trouble you Mr Lieders said he in
his slow undecided tones please excuse me with which he gathered up
the little man into his strong arms and slung him over his shoulders as
easily as he would sling a sack of meal It was a vent for Mrs Olsens
bubbling indignation to make a dive for Liederss heels and hold them
while Carl backed downstairs But Lieders did not make the least
resistance He allowed them to carry him into the room indicated by
his wife and to lay him bound on the plump feather bed It was not his
bedroom but the sacred spare room and the bed was part of its luxury
Thekla ran in first to remove the embroidered pillow shams and the
dazzling silken crazy quilt that was her choicest possession

Safely in the bed Lieders opened his eyes and looked from one face to
the other his lip curling You cant keep me this way all the time I
can do it in spite of you said he

Well I think you had ought to be ashamed of yourself Mr Lieders
Mrs Olsen burst out in a tremble between wrath and exertion shaking
her little plump fist at him

But the placid Carl only nodded as in sympathy saying Well I am
sorry you feel so bad Mr Lieders I guess we got to go now

Mrs Olsen looked as if she would have liked to exhort Lieders further
but she shrugged her shoulders and followed her husband in silence

I wished youd stay to breakfast now youre here Thekla urged out of
her imperious hospitality had Kurt been lying there dead the next meal
must have been offered just the same I know you aint got time to git
Mr Olsen his breakfast Freda before he has got to go to the shops
and my teakettle is boiling now and the coffeell be readyI GUESS
you had better stay

But Mrs Olsen seconded her husbands denial and there was nothing
left Thekla but to see them to the door No sooner did she return than
Lieders spoke Aint you going to take off them ropes said he

Not till you promise you wont do it

Silence Thekla brushing a few tears from her eyes scrutinized the
ropes again before she walked heavily out of the room She turned the
key in the door

Directly a savory steam floated through the hall and pierced the cracks
about the door then Theklas footsteps returned they echoed over the
uncarpeted boards

She had brought his breakfast cooked with the best of her homely skill
The pork chops that he liked had been fried there was a napkin on the
tray and the coffee was in the best gilt cup and saucer

Heres your breakfast papa said she trying to smile

I dont want no breakfast said he

She waited holding the tray and wistfully eying him

Take it way said he I wont touch it if you stand till doomsday
lessen you untie me

Ill untie your arm papa one arm you kin eat that way

Not lessen you untie all of me I wont touch a bite

You know why I wont untie you papa

Starving will kill as dead as hanging was Liederss orphic response
to this

Thekla sighed and went away leaving the tray on the table It may be
that she hoped the sight of food might stir his stomach to rebel against
his dogged will if so she was disappointed half an hour went by during
which the statue under the bedclothes remained without so much as a
quiver

Then the old woman returned Aint you awful cramped and stiff papa

Yes said the statue

Will you promise not to do yourself a mischief if I untie you

No

Thekla groaned while the tears started to her red eyelids But youll
git awful tired and it will hurt you if you dont get the ropes off
soon papa

I know that

He closed his eyes again to be the less hindered from dropping back
into his distempered musings Thekla took a seat by his side and sat
silent as he Slowly the natural pallor returned to the high forehead
and sharp features They were delicate features and there was an air of
refinement of thought about Liederss whole person as different
as possible from the robust comeliness of his wife With its keen
sensitiveness and its undefined melancholy it was a dreamers face One
meets such faces sometimes in incongruous places and wonders what they
mean In fact Kurt Lieders head cabinet maker in the furniture factory
of Lossing  Co was an artist He was also an incomparable artisan
and the most exacting foreman in the shops Thirty years ago he had
first taken wages from the senior Lossing He had watched a modest
industry climb up to a great business nor was he all at sea in his own
estimate of his share in the firms success Liederss workmanship had
an honesty an infinite patience of detail a daring skill of design
that came to be sought and commanded its own price The Lossing art
furniture did not slander the name No sculptor ever wrought his soul
into marble with a more unflinching conscience or a purer joy in his
work than this woodcarver dreaming over sideboards and bedsteads
Unluckily Lieders had the wrong side of the gift as well as the right
was full of whims and crotchets and as unpractical as the Christian
martyrs He openly defied expense and he would have no trifling with
the laws of art To make after orders was an insult to Kurt He made
what was best for the customer if the latter had not the sense to see
it he was a fool and a pig and some one else should work for him not
Kurt Lieders BEGEHR

Young Lossing had learned the business practically He was taught the
details by his fathers best workman and a mighty hard and strict
master the best workman proved Lossing did not dream that the crabbed
old tyrant who rarely praised him who made him go over for the
twentieth time any imperfect piece of work who exacted all the artisan
virtues to the last inch was secretly proud of him Yet in fact the
thread of romance in Liederss prosaic life was his idolatry of the
Lossing Manufacturing Co It is hard to tell whether it was the Lossings
or that intangible quantity the firm the business that he worshipped
Worship he did however the one or the other perhaps the both of them
though in the peevish and erratic manner of the savage who sometimes
grovels to his idols and sometimes kicks them

Nobody guessed what a blow it was to Kurt when a year ago the elder
Lossing had died Even his wife did not connect his sullen melancholy
and his gibes at the younger generation with the crape on Harry
Lossings hat He would not go to the funeral but worked savagely all
alone by himself in the shop the whole afternoonbreaking down at
last at the sight of a carved panel over which Lossing and he had once
disputed The desolate loneliness of the old came to him when his old
master was gone He loved the young man but the old man was of his own
generation he had known how things ought to be and he could understand
without talking Lieders began to be on the lookout for signs of waning
consideration to watch his own eyes and hands drearily wondering when
they would begin to play him false at the same time because he was
unhappy he was ten times as exacting and peremptory and critical with
the younger workmen and ten times as insolently independent with the
young master Often enough Lossing was exasperated to the point of
taking the old man at his word and telling him to go if he would but
every time the chain of long habit a real respect for such faithful
service and a keen admiration for Kurts matchless skill in his craft
had held him back He prided himself on keeping his word for that
reason he was warier of using it So he would compromise by giving the
domineering old fellow a good stiff rowing Once he coupled this
with a threat if they could not get along decently they would better
part Lieders had answered not a word he had given Lossing a queer
glance and turned on his heel He went home and bought some poison on
the way The old man is gone and the young feller dont want the old
crank round no more he said to himself Thekla I guess I make her
troubles too Ill git out

That was the beginning of his tampering with suicide Thekla who did
not have the same opinion of the trouble had interfered He had
married Thekla to have someone to keep a warm fireside for him but she
was an ignorant creature who never could be made to understand about
carving He felt sorry for her when the baby died the only child they
ever had he was sorrier than he expected to be on his own account too
for it was an ugly little creature only four days old and very red and
wrinkled but he never thought of confiding his own griefs or trials
to her Now it made him angry to have that stupid Thekla keep him in
a world where he did not wish to stay If the next day Lossing had not
remembered how his father valued Lieders and made an excuse to half
apologize to him I fear Theklas stratagems would have done little
good

The next experience was cut out of the same piece of cloth He had
relented he had allowed his wife to save him but he was angry in
secret Then came the day when open disobedience to Lossings orders had
snapped the last thread of Harrys patience To Liederss aggrieved If
you aint satisfied with my work Mr Lossing I kin quit the answer
had come instantly Very well Lieders Im sorry to lose you but we
cant have two bosses here you can go to the desk And when Lieders in
a blind stab of temper had growled a prophecy that Lossing would regret
it Lossing had stabbed in turn Maybe but it will be a cold day when
I ask you to come back And he had gone off without so much as a word
of regret The old workman had packed up his tools the pet tools that
no one was ever permitted to touch and crammed his arms into his coat
and walked out of the place where he had worked so long not a man
saying a word Lieders didnt reflect that they knew nothing of the
quarrel He glowered at them and went away sore at heart We make a
great mistake when we suppose that it is only the affectionate
that desire affection sulky and illconditioned souls often have a
passionate longing for the very feelings that they repel Lieders was a
womanish sensitive creature under the surly mask and he was cut to the
quick by his comrades apathy There aint no place for old men in this
world he thought theres them boys I done my best to make do a good
job and some of em Ive worked overtime to help and not one of em
has got as much as a goodby in him for me

But he did not think of going to poor Thekla for comfort he went to
his grim dreams I git my property all straight for Thekla and then
I quit said he Perhaps he gave himself a reprieve unconsciously
thinking that something might happen to save him from himself Nothing
happened None of the boys came to see him except Carl Olsen the
very stupidest man in the shop who put Lieders beside himself fifty
times a day The other men were sorry that Lieders had gone having a
genuine workmans admiration for his skill and a sort of underground
liking for the unreasonable old man because he was so absolutely honest
and a fellow could always tell where to find him But they were shy
they were afraid he would take their pity in bad part they waited a
while

Carl honest soul stood about in Liederss workshop kicking the
shavings with his heels for half an hour and grinned sheepishly
and was told what a worthless scamping bragging lot the boys at
Lossings were and said he guessed he had got to go home now and so
departed unwitting that his presence had been a consolation Mrs Olsen
asked Carl what Lieders said Carl answered simply Say Freda that
man feels terrible bad

Meanwhile Thekla seemed easily satisfied She made no outcry as Lieders
had dreaded over his leaving the shop

Well then papa you dont need git up so early in the morning no
more if you aint going to the shop was her only comment and Lieders
despised the mind of woman more than ever

But that evening while Lieders was down town occupied had she known
it with a codicil to his will she went over to the Olsens and found
out all Carl could tell her about the trouble in the shop And it was
she that made the excuse of marketing to go out the next day that
she might see the rich widow on the hill who was talking about a china
closet and Judge Trevor who had asked the price of a mantel and Mr
Martin who had looked at sideboards all this information came from
honest Carl and who proposed to them that they order such furniture
of the best cabinetmaker in the country now setting up on his own
account He simple as a baby for all his doggedness thought that
they came because of his fame as a workman and felt a glow of pride
particularly as having been prepared by the wife who said You see it
dont make so much difference with my Kurt bout de prize if so he can
get the furniture like he wants it and he always know of the best in
the old country they all were duly humble He accepted a few orders
and went to work with a will he would show them what the old man
could do But it was only a temporary gleam in a little while he grew
homesick for the shop for the sawdust floor and the familiar smell
of oil and the picture of Lossing flitting in and out He missed the
careless young workmen at whom he had grumbled he missed the whir of
machinery and the consciousness of rush and hurry accented by the cars
on the track outside In short he missed the feeling of being part of
a great whole At home in his cosey little improvised shop there was
none to dispute him but there was none to obey him either He grew
deathly tired of it all He got into the habit of walking around the
shops at night prowling about his old haunts like a cat Once the night
watchman saw him The next day there was a second watchman engaged
And Olsen told him very kindly meaning only to warn him that he was
suspected to be there for no good purpose Lieders confirmed a lurking
suspicion of the good Carls own by the clouding of his face Yet he
would have chopped his hand off rather than have lifted it against the
shop

That was Tuesday night this was Wednesday morning

The memory of it all the cruel sense of injustice returned with such
poignant force that Lieders groaned aloud

Instantly Thekla was bending over him He did not know whether to laugh
at her or to swear for she began fumbling at the ropes half sobbing
Yes I knowed they was hurting you papa Im going to loose one arm
Then I put it back again and loose the other Please dont be bad

He made no resistance and she was as good as her word She unbound and
bound him in sections as it were he watching her with a morose smile

Then she left the room but only to return with some hot coffee
Lieders twisted his head away No said he I dont eat none of that
breakfast not if you make fresh coffee all the morning I feel like I
dont eat never no more on earth

Thekla knew that the obstinate nature that she tempted was proof against
temptation if Kurt chose to starve starve he would with food at his
elbow

Oh papa she cried helplessly what IS the matter with you

Just dying is the matter with me Thekla If I cant die one way I kin
another Now Thekla I want you to quit crying and listen After Im
gone you go to the boss young Mr Lossingbut I always called him
Harry because he learned his trade of me Thekla but he dont think of
that nowand you tell him old Lieders that worked for him thirty years
is dead but he didnt hold no hard feelings he knowed he done wrong
bout that mantel Mind you tell him

Yes papa said Thekla which was a surprise to Kurt he had dreaded
a weak flood of tears and protestations But there were no tears no
protestations only a long look at him and a contraction of the eyebrows
as if Thekla were trying to think of something that eluded her She
placed the coffee on the tray beside the other breakfast For a while
the room was very still Lieders could not see the look of resolve that
finally smoothed the perplexed lines out of his wifes kind simple old
face She rose Kurt she said I dont guess you remember this is
our weddingday it was this day eighteen year we was married

So said Lieders well I was a bad bargain to you Thekla after
you nursed your father that was a cripple for twenty years I thought it
would be easy with me but I was a bad bargain

The Lord knows best about that said Thekla simply be it how it
be you are the only man I ever had or will have and I dont like you
starve yourself Papa say you dont kill yourself today and dat you
will eat your breakfast

Yes Lieders repeated in German a bad bargain for thee that is
sure But thou hast been a good bargain for me Here I promise Not
this day Give me the coffee

He had seasons all the morning of wondering over his meekness and
his agreement to be tied up again at night But still what did a
day matter a man humors womens notions and starving was so tedious
Between whiles he elaborated a scheme to attain his end How easy to
outwit the silly Thekla His eyes shone as he hid the little sharp
knife up his cuff Let her tie me says Lieders I keep my word
Tomorrow I be out of this He wont git a man like me pretty soon

Thekla went about her daily tasks with her everyday air but now and
again that same pucker of thought returned to her forehead and more
than once Lieders saw her stand over some dish poising her spoon in
air too abstracted to notice his cynical observation

The dinner was more elaborate than common and Thekla had broached a
bottle of her currant wine She gravely drank Liederss health And
many good days papa she said

Lieders felt a queer movement of pity After the table was cleared
he helped his wife to wash and wipe the dishes as his custom was of a
Sunday or holiday He wiped dishes as he did everything neatly slowly
with a careful deliberation Not until the dishes were put away and the
couple were seated did Thekla speak

Kurt she said I got to talk to you

An inarticulate groan and a glance at the door from Lieders I just got
to papa It aint righd for you to do the way you been doing for so long
time efery little whiles you try to kill yourself no papa that aint
righd

Kurt who had gotten out his pencils and compasses and other drawing
tools grunted I got to look at my work Thekla now I am too busy to
talk

No Kurt no papathe hands holding the blue apron that she was
embroidering with white linen began to tremble Lieders had not the
least idea what a strain it was on this reticent slow of speech woman
who had stood in awe of him for eighteen years to discuss the horror
of her life but he could not help marking her agitation She went on
desperately Yes papa I got to talk it oud with you You had ought
to listen cause I always been a good wife to you and nefer refused you
notings No

Well I aint saying I done it cause you been bad to me everybody
knows we aint had no trouble

But everybody what dont know us when they read how you tried to kill
yourself in the papers they think it was me That always is so And now
I never can any more sleep nights for you is always maybe git up and
do something to yourself So now I got to talk to you papa Papa how
could you done so

Lieders twisted his feet under the rungs of his chair he opened his
mouth but only to shut it again with a click of his teeth

I got my mind made up papa I tought and I tought I know WHY you done
it you done it cause you and the boss was mad at each other The boss
hadnt no righd to let you go

Yes he had I madded him first I was a fool Of course I knowed more
than him bout the work but I hadnt no right to go against him The
boss is all right

Yes papa I got my mind made uplike most sluggish spirits there was
an immense momentum about Theklas mind once get it fairly started it
was not to be divertedyou never killed yourself before you used to
git mad at the boss You was afraid he would send you away and now you
have sent yourself away you dont want to live cause you do not know
how you can git along without the shop But you want to get back you
want to get back more as you want to kill yourself Yes papa I know
I know where you did used to go nights Nowshe changed her speech
unconsciously to the tongue of her youthit is not fair it is not
fair to me that thou shouldst treat me like that thou dost belong to
me also so I say my Kurt wilt thou make a bargain with me If I
shall get thee back thy place wilt thou promise me never to kill thyself
any more

Lieders had not once looked up at her during the slow difficult
sentences with their half choked articulation but he was experiencing
some strange emotions and one of them was a novel respect for his wife
All he said was Taint no use talking I wont never ask him to take
me back once

Well you aint asking of him _I_ ask him I try to git you back
once

I tell you it aint no use I know the boss he aint going to be
letting womans talk him over no hes a good man he knows how to work
his business himself

But would you promise me Kurt

Liederss eyes blurred with a mild and dreamy mist he sighed softly
Thekla you cant see how it is It is like you are tied up if I dont
can do that if I can then it is always that I am free free to go free
to stay And for you Thekla it is the same

Theklas mild eyes flashed I dont believe you would like it so you
wake up in the morning and find ME hanging up in the kitchen by the
clothesline

Lieders had the air of one considering deeply Then he gave Thekla one
of the surprises of her life he rose from his chair he walked in his
shuffling unheeled slippers across the room to where the old woman sat
he put one arm on the back of the chair and stiffly bent over her and
kissed her

Lieber Herr Je gasped Thekla

Then I shall go too pretty quick that is all mamma said he

Thekla wiped her eyes A little pause fell between them and in it they
may have both remembered vanished halfforgotten days when life had
looked differently to them when they had never thought to sit by
their own fireside and discuss suicide The husband spoke first with
a reluctant halfshamed smile Thekla I tell you what I make the
bargain with you you git me back that place I dont do it again less
you let me you dont git me back that place you dont say notings to
me

The apron dropped from the withered brown hands to the floor Again
there was silence but not for long ghastly as was the alternative the
proposal offered a chance to escape from the terror that was sapping her
heart

How long will you give me papa said she

I give you a week said he

Thekla rose and went to the door as she opened it a fierce gust of wind
slashed her like a knife and Lieders exclaimed fretfully what you
opening that door for Thekla letting in the wind Im so cold now
right by the fire I most cant draw We got to keep a fire in the
baseburner good all night or the plants will freeze

Thekla said confusedly that something sounded like a cat crying And
you talking like that it frightened me maybe I was wrong to make such
bargains

Then dont make it said Lieders curtly I aint asking you

But Thekla drew a long breath and straightened herself saying Yes I
make it papa I make it

Well put another stick of wood in the stove will you now you are
up said Lieders shrugging his shoulders or Ill freeze in spite of
you It seems to me it grows colder every minute

But all that day he was unusually gentle with Thekla He talked of his
youth and the struggles of the early days of the firm he related a
dozen tales of young Lossing all illustrating some admirable trait that
he certainly had not praised at the time Never had he so opened his
heart in regard to his own ideals of art his own ambitions And Thekla
listened not always comprehending but always sympathizing she was
almost like a comrade Kurt thought afterward

The next morning he was surprised to have her appear equipped for the
street although it was bitterly cold She wore her garb of ceremony a
black alpaca gown with a white crocheted collar neatly turned over the
long black broadcloth cloak in which she had taken pride for the last
five years and her quilted black silk bonnet was on her gray head When
she put up her foot to don her warm overshoes Kurt saw that the stout
ankles were encased in white stockings This was the last touch
Gracious Thekla cried Kurt are you going to market this day It is
the coldest day this winter

Oh I dont mind replied Thekla nervously Then she had wrapped a
scarf about her and gone out while he was getting into his own coat and
conning a proffer to go in her stead

Oh well Thekla she aint such a fool like she looks he observed to
the cat say pussy WAS it you out yestiddy

The cat only blinked her yellow eyes and purred She knew that she had
not been out last night Not any better than her mistress however who
at this moment was hailing a streetcar

The streetcar did not land her anywhere near a market it whirled her
past the lines of low wooden houses into the big brick shops with their
arched windows and terracotta ornaments that showed the ambitious
architecture of a growing Western town past these into mills and
factories and smokestained chimneys Here she stopped An acquaintance
would hardly have recognized her her ruddy cheeks had grown so pale
But she trotted on to the great building on the corner from whence came
a low incessant buzz She went into the first door and ran against Carl
Olsen Carl I got to see Mr Lossing said she breathlessly

There aint noding

No Gott sei dank but I got to see him

It was not Carls way to ask questions he promptly showed her the
office and she entered She had not seen young Harry Lossing half a
dozen times and now her anxious eyes wandered from one dapper figure
at the high desks to another until Lossing advanced to her

He was a handsome young man she thought and he had kind eyes but they
hardened at her first timid sentence I am Mrs Lieders I come about
my man

Will you walk in here Mrs Lieders said Lossing His voice was like
the ice on the windowpanes

She followed him into a little room He shut the door

Declining the chair that he pushed toward her she stood in the centre of
the room looking at him with the pleading eyes of a child

Mr Lossing will you please save my Kurt from killing himself

What do you mean Lossings voice had not thawed

It is for you that he will kill himself Mr Lossing This is the dird
time he has done it It is because he is so lonesome now your father is
died and he thinks that you forget and he has worked so hard for you
but he thinks that you forget He was never tell me till yesterday and
thenit wasit was because I would not let him hang himself

Hang himself stammered Lossing you dont mean

Yes he was hang himself but I cut him no I broke him down said
Thekla accurate in all the disorder of her spirits and forthwith with
many tremors but clearly she told the story of Kurts despair She
told as Lieders never would have known how to tell even had his pride
let him all the mans devotion for the business all his personal
attachment to the firm she told of his gloom after the elder Lossing
died for he was think there was no one in this town such good man
and so smart like your fader Mr Lossing no and he would set all
the evening and try to draw and make the lines all wrong and then he
would drow the papers in the fire and go and walk outside and he say I
cant do nothing righd no more now the old mans died they dont have
no use for me at the shop pretty quick and that make him feel awful
bad She told of his homesick wanderings about the shops by night
but he was better as a watchman he wouldnt hurt it for the world He
telled me how you was hide his dinnerpail onct for a joke and put in a
piece of your pie and how you climbed on the roof with the hose when
it was afire And he telled me if he shall die I shall tell you that
he aint got no hard feelings but you didnt know how that mantel had
ought to be so he done it right the other way but he hadnt no righd
to talk to you like he done nohow and you was all righd to send him
away but you might a shaked hands and none of the boys never said
nothing nor none of them never come to see him cept Carl Olsen and
that make him feel awful bad too And when he feels so bad he dont no
more want to live so I make him promise if I git him back he never try
to kill himself again Oh Mr Lossing please dont let my man die

Bewildered and more touched than he cared to feel himself Lossing
still made a feeble stand for discipline I dont see how Lieders can
expect me to take him back again he began

He aint expecting you Mr Lossing its ME

But didnt Lieders tell you I told him I would never take him back

No sir no Mr Lossing it was not that it was you said it would
be a cold day that you would take him back and it was git so cold
yesterday so I think Now it would be a cold day tomorrow and Mr
Lossing he can take Kurt back And it IS the most coldest day this
year

Lossing burst into a laugh perhaps he was glad to have the Western
sense of humor come to the rescue of his compassion Well it was a
cold day for you to come all this way for nothing said he You go
home and tell Lieders to report tomorrow

Kurts manner of receiving the news was characteristic He snorted
in disgust Well I did think he had more sand than to give in to a
woman But after he heard the whole story he chuckled Yes it was
that way he said and he must do like he said but that was a funny way
you done Thekla Say mamma yesterday was you look out for the cat or
to find how cold it been

Never you mind papa said Thekla you remember what you promised if
I git you back

Liederss eyes grew dull he flung his arms out with a long sigh No
I dont forget I will keep my promise butit is like the handcuffs
Thekla it is like the handcuffs In a second however he added in a
changed tone But thou art a kind jailer mamma more like a comrade
And no it was not fair to theeI know that now Thekla




THE FACE OF FAILURE

AFTER the weeks shower the low Iowa hills looked vividly green At the
base of the first range of hills the Blackhawk road winds from the city
to the prairie From its startingpoint just outside the city limits
the wayfarer may catch birdseye glimpses of the city the vast river
that the Iowans love and the three bridges tying three towns to the
island arsenal But at ones elbow spreads Cavendishs melon farm
Cavendishs melon farm it still is in current phrase although
Cavendish whose memory is honored by lovers of the cantaloupe melon
long ago departed to raise melons for larger markets and still a
weatherbeaten sign creaks from a post announcing to the world that the
celebrated Cavendish Melons are for Sale here Today the melonvines
were softly shaded by raindrops A pleasant sight they made spreading
for acres in front of the greenhouses where mushrooms and early
vegetables strove to outwit the seasons and before the brown cottage
in which Cavendish had begun a successful career The black rooftree
of the cottage sagged in the middle and the weatherboarding was dingy
with the streaky dinginess of old paint that has never had enough oil
The fences too were unpainted and rudely patched Nevertheless a
second glance told one that there were no gaps in them that the farm
machines kept their bright colors well under cover and that the garden
rows were beautifully straight and clean An old white horse switched
its sleek sides with its long tail and drooped its untrammelled neck in
front of the gate The wagon to which it was harnessed was new and had
just been washed Near the gate stood a girl and boy who seemed to be
mutually studying each others person Decidedly the girls slim light
figure in its dainty frock repaid ones eyes for their trouble and her
face with its brilliant violet eyes its full soft chin its curling
auburn hair and delicate tints was charming but her brothers look
was anything but approving His lip curled and his small gray eyes grew
smaller under his scowling brows

Is THAT your best suit said the girl

Yes it is and its GOING to be for one while said the boy

It was a suit of the cotton mixture that looks like wool when it is new
and cuts a figure on the counters of every dealer in cheap readymade
clothing It had been Tim Powells best attire for a year perhaps he
had not been careful enough of it and that was why it no longer cared
even to imitate wool it was faded to the hue of a clay bank it was
threadbare the trousers bagged at the knees the jacket bagged at the
elbows the pockets bulged flabbily from sheer force of habit although
there was nothing in them

I thought you were to have a new suit said the girl Uncle told me
himself he was going to buy you one yesterday when you went to town

I wouldnt have asked him to buy me anything yesterday for moren a
suit of clothes

Why The girl opened her eyes Didnt he do anything with the lawyer
Is that why you are both so glum this morning

No he didnt The lawyer says the woman that owns the mortgage has got
to have the money And its due next week

The girl grew pale all over her pretty rosy cheeks her eyes filled with
tears as she gasped Oh how hateful of her when she promised

She never promised nothing Eve it aint been hers for more than three
months Sloan that used to have it died and left his property to be
divided up between his nieces and the mortgage is her share See

I dont care its just as mean Mr Sloan promised

No he didnt he jest said if Uncle was behind he wouldnt press him
and he did let Uncle get behind with the interest two times and never
kicked But he died and now the woman she wants her money

I think it is mean and cruel of her to turn us out Uncle says
mortgages are wicked anyhow and I believe him

I guess he couldnt have bought this place if he didnt give a mortgage
on it And hed have had enough to pay cash too if Richards hadnt
begged him so to lend it to him

When is Richards going to pay him

It come due three months ago Richards aint never paid up the interest
even and now he says hes got to have the mortgage extended for three
years anyhow for two

But dont he KNOW weve got to pay our own mortgage How can we help
HIM I wish Uncle would sell him out

The boy gave her the superior smile of the masculine creature I
suppose he remarked with elaborate irony that hes like Uncle and
you he thinks mortgages are wicked

And just as like as not Uncle wont want to go to the carnival Eve
went on her eyes filling again

Tim gazed at her scowling and sneering but she was absorbed in dreams
and hopes with which as yet his boyish mind had no point of contact

All the girls in the A class were going to go to see the fireworks
together and George Dean and some of the boys were going to take us
and we were going to have tea at May Arlingtons house and I was to
stay all nightthis came in a half sob I think it is just too mean
I never have any good times

Oh yes you do sis lots Uncle always gits you everything you want
And he feels terrible bad when Iwhen he knows he cant afford to git
something you want

I know well enough who tells him we cant afford things

Well do you want us to git things we cant afford I aint never
advised him except the best I knew how I told him Richards was a
blowhard and I told him those Alliance grocery folks he bought such a
lot of truck of would skin him and they did those canned things they
sold him was all musty and they said there wasnt any freight on em
and he had to pay freight and a fancy price besides and I dont believe
they had any more to do with the Alliance than our cow

Uncle always believes everything He always is so sure things are going
to turn out just splendid and they dontonly just middling and then
he loses a lot of money

But he is an awful good man said the boy musingly

I dont believe in being so good you cant make money I dont want
always to be poor and despised and have the other girls have prettier
clothes than me

I guess you can be pretty good and yet make money if you are sharp
enough Of course you got to be sharper to be good and make money than
you got to be to be mean and make money

Well I know one thing that Uncle aint EVER going to make money
He The last word shrivelled on her lips which puckered into a
confused smile at the warning frown of her brother The man that they
were discussing had come round to them past the henhouse How much had
he overheard

He didnt seem angry anyhow He called Well Evy ready and Eve was
glad to run into the house for her hat without looking at him It was a
relief that she must sit on the back seat where she need not face Uncle
Nelson Tim sat in front but Tim was so stupid he wouldnt mind

Nor did he it was Nelson Forrest that stole furtive glances at the
lads profile the knitted brows the freckled cheeks the undecided
nose and firm mouth

The boyish shoulders slouched forward at the same angle as that of the
fiftyyearold shoulders beside him Nelson through long following of
the plough had lost the erect carriage painfully acquired in the army
He was a handsome man whose freshcolored skin gave him a perpetual
appearance of having just washed his face The features were long and
delicate The brown eyes had a liquid softness like the eyes of a woman
In general the countenance was alertly intelligent he looked younger
than his years but this afternoon the lines about his mouth and in his
brows warranted every gray hair of his pointed short beard There was a
reason Nelson was having one of those searing flashes of insight that
do come occasionally to the most blindly hopeful souls Nelson had hoped
all his life He hoped for himself he hoped for the whole human race
He served the abstraction that he called PROgress with unflinching and
unquestioning loyalty Every new scheme of increasing happiness by force
found a helper a fighter and a giver in him by turns he had been
an Abolitionist a Fourierist a Socialist a Greenbacker a Farmers
Alliance man Disappointment always was followed hard on its heels by a
brandnew confidence Progress ruled his farm as well as his politics
he bought the newest implements and subscribed trustfully to four
agricultural papers but being a born lover of the ground a vein of
saving doubt did assert itself sometimes in his work and on the whole
as a farmer he was successful But his success never ventured outside
his farm gates At buying or selling at a bargain in any form the
fourteenyearold Tim was better than Nelson with his fifty years
experience of a wicked and bargaining world

Was that any part of the reason he wondered today why at the end of
thirty years of unflinching toil and honesty he found himself with
a vast budget of experience in the ruinous loaning of money with a
mortgage on the farm of a friend and a mortgage on his own farm likely
to be foreclosed Perhaps it might have been better to stay in Henry
County He had paid for his farm at last He had known a good moment
too that day he drove away from the lawyers with the cancelled
mortgage in his pocket and Tim hopping up and down on the seat for
joy But the next day Richardsjust to give him the chance of a good
thinghad brought out that Maine man who wanted to buy him out He was
anxious to put the money down for the new farm to have no whiplash of
debt forever whistling about his ears as he ploughed ready to sting did
he stumble in the furrows and Tim was more anxious than he butthere
was Richards Richards was a neighbor who thought as he did about Henry
George and Spiritualism and belonged to the Farmers Alliance and
had lent Nelson all the works of Henry George that he Richards could
borrow Richards was in deep trouble He had lost his wife he might
lose his farm He appealed to Nelson for the sake of old friendship
to save him And Nelson could not resist so two thousand of the
thirtyfour hundred dollars that the Maine man paid went to Richards
the latter swearing by all that is holy to pay his friend off in full
at the end of the year There was money coming to him from his dead
wifes estate but it was tied up in the courts Nelson would not listen
to Tims prophecies of evil But he was a little dashed when Richards
paid neither interest nor principal at the years end although he gave
reasons of weight and he experienced veritable consternation when the
renewed mortgage ran its course and still Richards could not pay The
money from his wifes estate had been used to improve his farm Nelson
knew how rundown everything was his new wife was sickly and didnt
seem to take hold there had been a disastrous hailstormbut
why rehearse the calamities they focussed on one sentence it was
impossible to pay

Then Nelson who had been restfully counting on the money from Richards
for his own debt bestirred himself only to find his patient creditor
gone and a woman in his stead who must have her money He wrote
againsorely against his willbegging Richards to raise the money
somehow Richardss answer was in his pocket for he wore the best black
broadcloth in which he had done honor to the lawyer yesterday Richards
plainly was wounded but he explained in detail to Nelson how he
Nelson could borrow money of the banks on his farm and pay Miss Brown
There was no bank where Richards could borrow money and he begged
Nelson not to drive his wife and little children from their cherished
home Nelson choked over the pathos when he read the letter to Tim but
Tim only grunted a wish that HE had the handling of that feller And the
lawyer was as little moved as Tim Miss Brown needed the money he said
The banks were not disposed to lend just at present money it appeared
was tight so in the end Nelson drove home with the face of Failure
staring at him between his horses ears

There was only one way Should he make Richards suffer or suffer
himself Did a man have to grind other people or be ground himself
Meanwhile they had reached the town The stir of a festival was in the
air On every side bunting streamed in the breeze or was draped across
brick or wood Arches spanned some of the streets with inscriptions of
welcome on them and swarms of colored lanterns glittered against the
sunlight almost as gayly as they would show when they should be lighted
at night Little children ran about waving flags Grocery wagons and
butchers wagons trotted by with a flash of flags dangling from the
horses harness The streets were filled with people in their holiday
clothes Everybody smiled The shopkeepers answered questions and went
out on the sidewalks to direct strangers From one window hung a banner
inviting visitors to enter and get a list of hotels and boardinghouses
The crowd was entirely goodhumored and waited outside restaurants
bandying jokes with true Western philosophy At times the wagons made
a temporary blockade in the street but no one grumbled Bands of music
paraded past them the escort for visitors of especial consideration
In a window belonging the sign above declared to the Business Mens
Association stood a huge doll clad in blue satin on which was painted
a device of Neptune sailing down the Mississippi amid a storm of
fireworks The doll stood in a boat arched about with lanterndecked
hoops and while Nelson halted unable to proceed he could hear
the voluble explanation of the proud citizen who was interpreting to
strangers

This Nelson thought was success Here were the successful men The man
who had failed looked at them Eve roused him by a shrill cry There
they are Theres May and the girls Let me out quick Uncle

He stopped the horse and jumped out himself to help her It was the
first time since she came under his roof that she had been away from it
all night He cleared his throat for some advice on behavior Mind and
be respectful to Mrs Arlington Say yes maam and no maam He
got no further for Eve gave him a hasty kiss and the crowd brushed her
away

All she thinks of is wearing fine clothes and going with the fellers
said her brother disdainfully If I had to be born a girl I wouldnt
be born at all

Maybe if you despise girls so youll be born a girl the next time
said Nelson Some folks thinks thats how it happens with us

Do YOU Uncle asked Tim running his mind forebodingly over the
possible business results of such a belief Sposing he shouldnt be
willing to sell the pigs to be killed cause they might be some friends
of his he reflected with a rising tide of consternation Nelson
smiled rather sadly He said in another tone Tim Ive thought so
many things that now Ive about given up thinking All I can do is to
live along the best way I know how and help the world move the best Im
able

You bet _I_ aint going to help the world move said the boy Im
going to look out for myself

Then my training of you has turned out pretty badly if thats the way
you feel

A little shiver passed over the lads sullen face he flushed until he
lost his freckles in the red veil and burst out passionately Well I
got eyes aint I I aint going to be bad or drink or steal or do
things to git put in the penitentiary but I aint going to let folks
walk all over me like you do no sir

Nelson did not answer in his heart he thought that he had failed with
the children too and he relapsed into that dismal study of the face of
Failure

He had come to the city to show Tim the sights and therefore though
like a man in a dream he drove conscientiously about the gay streets
pointing out whatever he thought might interest the boy and generally
discovering that Tim had the new information by heart already All
the while a question pounded itself like the beat of the heart of an
engine through the noise and the talk Shall I give up Richards or be
turned out myself

When the afternoon sunlight waned he put up the horse at a modest little
stable where farmers were allowed to bring their own provender The
charges were of the smallest and the place neat and weathertight
but it had been a long time before Nelson could be induced to use it
because there was a higherpriced stable kept by an exfarmer and
member of the Farmers Alliance Only the fact that the keeper of the
lowpriced stable was a poor orphan girl struggling to earn an honest
livelihood had moved him

They had supper at a restaurant of Tims discovery small specklessly
tidy and as unexacting of the pocket as the stable It was an excellent
supper But Nelson had no appetite in spite of an almost childish
capacity for being diverted he could attend to nothing but the question
always in his ears Richards or mewhich

Until it should be time for the spectacle they walked down the hill
and watched the crowds gradually blacken every inch of the riverbanks
Already the swarms of lanterns were beginning to bloom out in the dusk
Strains of music throbbed through the air adding a poignant touch to
the excitement vibrating in all the faces and voices about them Even
the stolid Tim felt the contagion He walked with a jaunty step and
assaulted a tune himself I tell you Uncle says Tim its nice of
these folks to be getting up all this show and giving it for nothing

Do you think so says Nelson You dont love your book as I wish
you did but I guess you remember about the ancient Romans and how the
great rich Romans used to spend enormous sums in games and shows that
they let the people in free towell what for Was it to learn them
anything or to make them happy Oh no it was to keep down the spirit
of liberty Son it was to make them content to be slaves And so it
is here These merchants and capitalists are only looking out for
themselves trying to keep labor down and not let it know how oppressed
it is trying to get people here from everywhere to show what a fine
city they have and get their money

Well TIS a fine town Tim burst in a boss town And they aint
gouging folks a little bit None of the hotels or the restaurants
have put up their prices one cent Look what a dandy supper we got for
twentyfive cents And aint the boy at Lumleys grocery given me two
tickets to set on the steamboat Theres nothing mean about this town

Nelson made no remark but he thought for the fiftieth time that his
farm was too near the city Tim was picking up all the city boys false
pride as well as their slang Unconscious Tim resumed his tune He knew
that it was Annie Rooney if no one else did and he mangled the notes
with appropriate exhilaration

Now the river was as busy as the land lights swimming hither and
thither steamboats with ropes of tiny stars bespangling their dark bulk
and a white electric glare in the bow low boats with lights that sent
wavering spearheads into the shadow beneath The bridge was a blazing
barbed fence of fire and beyond the bridge at the point of the island
lay a glittering multitude of lights a fairy fleet with miniature sails
outlined in flame as if by jewels

Nelson followed Tim The crowds the ceaseless clatter of tongues and
jar of wheels depressed the man who hardly knew which way to dodge
the multitudinous perils of the thoroughfare but Tim used his elbows to
such good purpose that they were out of the levee on the steamboat and
settling themselves in two comfortable chairs in a coign of vantage on
deck that commanded the best obtainable view of the pageant before
Nelson had gathered his wits together enough to plan a path out of the
crush

I sized up this place from the shore Tim sighed complacently drawing
a long breath of relief only jest two chairs so we wont be crowded

Obediently Nelson took his chair His head sank on his thin chest
Richards or himself which should he sacrifice So the weary old
question droned through his brain He felt a tap on his shoulder The
man who roused him was an acquaintance and he stood smiling in the
attitude of a man about to ask a favor while the expectant halfsmile
of the lady on his arm hinted at the nature of the favor Would Mr
Forrest be so kindthere seemed to be no more seats Before Mr
Forrest could be kind Tim had yielded his own chair and was off
wriggling among the crowd in search of another place

Smart boy that youngster of yours said the man hell make his way
in the world he can push Well Miss Alma let me make you acquainted
with Mr Forrest I know you will be well entertained by him So if
youll excuse me Ill get back and help my wife wrestle with the kids
They have been trying to see which will fall overboard first ever since
we came on deck

Under the leeway of this pleasantry he bowed and retired Nelson turned
with determined politeness to the lady He was sorry that she had come
she looking to him a very fine lady indeed with her black silk gown
her shining black ornaments and her bright black eyes She was not
young but handsome in Nelsons judgment although of a haughty bearing
Maybe she is the principal of the High School thought he Martin has
her for a boarder and he said she was very particular about her melons
being cold

But however formidable a personage the lady must be entertained

I expect you are a resident of the city maam said Nelson

Yes I was born here She smiled a smile that revealed a little break
in the curve of her cheek not exactly a dimple but like one

I dont know when I have seen such a fine appearing lady thought
Nelson He responded Well I wasnt born here but I come when I was
a little shaver of ten and stayed till I was eighteen when I went to
Kansas to help fight the border ruffians I went to school here in the
Warren Street schoolhouse

So did I as long as I went anywhere to school I had to go to work
when I was twelve

Nelsons amazement took shape before his courtesy had a chance to
control it I didnt suppose you ever did any work in your life cried
he

I guess I havent done much else Father died when I was twelve and the
oldest of five the next only eightPolly that came between Eb and me
diednaturally I had to work I was a nursegirl by the day first and
I never shall forget how kind the woman was to me She gave me so much
dinner I never needed to eat any breakfast which was a help

You poor little thing Im afraid you went hungry sometimes
Immediately he marvelled at his familiar speech but she did not seem to
resent it

No not so often she said musingly but I used often and often
to wish I could carry some of the nice things home to mother and the
babies After a while she would give me a cookey or a piece of bread
and butter for lunch that I could take home I dont suppose Ill often
have more pleasure than I used to have then seeing little Eb waiting
for sister and the baby and mother She stopped abruptly to
continue in an instant with a kind of laugh I am never likely to
feel so important again as I did then either It was great to have
mother consulting me as if I had been grown up I felt like I had the
weight of the nation on my shoulders I assure you

And have you always worked since You are not working out now with a
glance at her shining gown

Oh no not for a long time I learned to be a cook I was a good cook
too if I say it myself I worked for the Lossings for four years I am
not a bit ashamed of being a hired girl for I was as good a one as
I knew how It was Mrs Lossing that first lent me books and Harry
Lossing who is head of the firm now got Ebenezer into the works
Ebenezer is shippingclerk with a good salary and stock in the concern
and Ralph is there learning the trade I went to the businesscollege
and learned bookkeeping and afterward I learned typewriting and
shorthand I have been working for the firm for fourteen years We
have educated the girls Milly is married and Kitty goes to the
boardingschool here

Then you havent been married yourself

What time did I have to think of being married I had the family on my
mind and looking after them

That was more fortunate for your family than it was for my sex
said Nelson gallantly He accompanied the compliment by a glance of
admiration extinguished in an eyeflash for the white radiance that
had bathed the deck suddenly vanished

Now you will see a lovely sight said the woman deigning no reply to
his tribute listen That is the signal

The air was shaken with the boom of cannon Once twice thrice
Directly the boatwhistles took up the roar making a hideous din The
fleet had moved Spouting rockets and Roman candles which painted above
it a kaleidoscopic archway of fire welcomed by answering javelins of
light and red and orange and blue and green flares from the shore the
fleet bombarded the bridge escorted Neptune in his car manoeuvred and
massed and charged on the blazing city with a manyhued shower of flame

After the boats silently softly floated the battalions of lanterns
so close to the water that they seemed flaming waterlilies while the
dusky mirror repeated and inverted their splendor

Theyre shingles you know explained Nelsons companion with
lanterns on them but arent they pretty

Yes they are I wish you had not told me It is like a fairy story

Aint it But we arent through theres more to come Beautiful
fireworks

The fireworks however were slow of coming They could see the barge
from which they were to be sent they could watch the movements of the
men in white oilcloth who moved in a ghostly fashion about the barge
they could hear the tap of hammers but nothing came of it all

They sat in the darkness waiting and there came to Nelson a strange
sensation of being alone and apart from all the breathing world with
this woman He did not perceive that Tim had quietly returned with a box
which did very well for a seat and was sitting with his knees against
the chairrungs He seemed to be somehow outside of all the tumult and
the spectacle It was the vainglorying triumph of this world He was the
soul outside the soul that had missed its triumph In his perplexity
and loneliness he felt an overwhelming longing for sympathy neither did
it strike Nelson who believed in all sorts of occult influences that
his confidence in a stranger was unwarranted He would have told you
that his psychic instincts never played him false although really
they were traitors from their astral cradles to their astral graves

He said in a hesitating way You must excuse me being kinder dull Ive
got some serious business on my mind and I cant help thinking of it

Is that so Well I know how that is I have often stayed awake nights
worrying about things Lest I shouldnt suit and all thatespecially
after mother took sick

I spose you had to give up and nurse her then

That was what Ebenezer and Ralph were for having me do but mothermy
mother always had so much sensemother says No Alma youve got a
good place and a chance in life you shant give it up Well hire a
girl I aint never lonesome except evenings and then you will be home
I should jest want to die she says if I thought I kept you in a kind
of prison like by my being sicknow just when you are getting on
so well There never WAS a woman like my mother Her voice shook a
little and Nelson asked gently

Aint your mother living now

No she died last year She added after a little silence I somehow
cant get used to being lonesome

It IS hard said Nelson I lost my wife three years ago

Thats hard too

My goodness I guess it is And its hardest when trouble comes on a
man and he cant go nowhere for advice

Yes thats so too Buthave you any children

Yes maam that is they aint my own children Lizzie and I never had
any but these two we took and they are most like my own The girl is
eighteen and the boy rising of fourteen

They must be a comfort to you but they are considerable of a
responsibility too

Yes maam he sighed softly to himself Sometimes I feel I havent
done the right way by them though Ive tried Not that they aint
good children for they areno better anywhere Tim he will work from
morning till night and never need to urge him and he never gives me a
promise he dont keep it no maam never did since he was a little
mite of a lad And he is a kind boy too always good to the beasts and
while he may speak up a little short to his sister he saves her many a
step He doesnt take to his studies quite as I would like to have him
but he has a wonderful head for business There is splendid stuff in Tim
if it could only be worked right

While Nelson spoke Tim was hunching his shoulders forward in the
darkness listening with the whole of two sharp ears His face worked in
spite of him and he gave an inarticulate snort

Well the woman said I think that speaks well for Tim Why should
you be worried about him

I am afraid he is getting to love money and worldly success too well
and that is what I fear for the girl too You see she is so pretty
and the idols of the tribe and the market as Bacon calls them are
strong with the young

Yes thats so the woman assented vaguely not at all sure what
either Bacon or his idols might be Are the children relations of
yours

No maam it was like this When I was up in Henry County there came
a photographic artist to the village near us and pitched his tent and
took tintypes in his wagon He had his wife and his two children with
him The poor woman fell ill and died so we took the two children
My wife was willing she was a wonderfully good woman member of the
Methodist church till she died II am not a church member myself
maam I passed through that stage of spiritual development a long
while ago He gave a wistful glance at his companions dimly outlined
profile But I never tried to disturb her faith it made HER happy

Oh I dont think it is any good fooling with other peoples
religions said the woman easily It is just like trying to talk
folks out of drinking nobody knows what is right for anybody elses
soul any more than they do what is good for anybody elses stomach

Yes maam You put things very clearly

I guess it is because you understand so quickly But you were
saying

Thats all the story We took the children and their father was killed
by the cars the next year poor man and so we have done the best we
could ever since by them

I should say you had done very well by them

No maam I havent done very well somehow by anyone myself included
though God knows Ive tried hard enough

Then followed the silence natural after such a confession when the
listener does not know the speaker well enough to parry abasement by
denial

I am impressed said Nelson simply to talk with you frankly It
isnt polite to bother strangers with your troubles but I am impressed
that you wont mind

Oh no I wont mind

It was not extravagant sympathy but Nelson thought how kind her voice
sounded and what a musical voice it was Most people would have called
it rather sharp

He told herwith surprisingly little egotism as the keen listener
notedthe story of his life the struggle of his boyhood his random
selfeducation his years in the army he had criticised his superior
officers thereby losing the promotion that was coming for bravery in
the field his marriage apparently he had married his wife because
another man had jilted her his wrestle with nature whose pranks
included a cyclone on a frontier farm that he eventually lost having
put all his savings into a Greenback newspaper and being thus swamped
with debt his final slow success in paying for his Iowa farm and his
purchase of the new farm with its resulting disaster Ive farmed in
Kansas he said in Nebraska in Dakota in Iowa I was willing to
go wherever the land promised It always seemed like I was going to
succeed but somehow I never did The world aint fixed right for the
workers I take it A man who has spent thirty years in hard honest
toil oughtnt to be staring ruin in the face like I am today They
wont let it be so when we have the single tax and when we farmers send
our own men instead of city lawyers to the Legislature and halls of
Congress Sometimes I think its the world thats wrong and sometimes I
think its me

The reply came in crisp and assured accents which were the strongest
contrast to Nelsons soft undecided pipe Seems to me in this last
case the one most to blame is neither you nor the world at large but
this man Richards who is asking YOU to pay for HIS farm And I notice
you dont seem to consider your creditor in this business How do you
know she dont need the money Look at me for instance Im in some
financial difficulty myself I have a mortgage for two thousand dollars
and that mortgagefor which good value was given mind youfalls due
this month I want the money I want it bad I have a chance to put
my money into stock at the factory I know all about the investment
I havent worked there all these years and not know how the business
stands It is a chance to make a fortune I aint likely to ever have
another like it and it wont wait for me to make up my mind forever
either Isnt it hard on me too

Lord knows it is maam said Nelson despondently it is hard on
us all Sometimes I dont see the end of it all A vast social
revolution

Social fiddlesticks I beg your pardon Mr Forrest but it puts me out
of patience to have people expecting to be allowed to make every mortal
kind of fools of themselves and then have a social revolution jump in
to slue off the consequences Let us understand each other Who do you
suppose I am

MissMiss Almer aint it

Its Alma Brown Mr Forrest I saw you coming on the boat and I made
Mr Martin fetch me over to you I told him not to say my name because
I wanted a good plain talk with you Well Ive had it Things are
just about where I thought they were and I told Mr Lossing so But I
couldnt be sure You must have thought me a funny kind of woman to be
telling you all those things about myself

Nelson who had changed color half a dozen times in the darkness sighed
before he said No maam I only thought how good you were to tell me
I hoped maybe you were impressed to trust me as I was to trust you

Being so dark Nelson could not see the queer expression on her face as
she slowly shook her head She was thinking If I ever saw a babe in
arms trying to do business How did HE ever pay for a farm She said
Well I did it on purpose I wanted you to know I wasnt a cruel
aristocrat but a woman that had worked as hard as yourself Now why
shouldnt you help me and yourself instead of helping Richards You have
confidence in me you say Well show it Ill give you your mortgage
for your mortgage on Richardss farm Come cant you trust Richards to
me You think it over

The hiss of a rocket hurled her words into space The fireworks had
begun Miss Brown looked at them and watched Nelson at the same time
As a good business woman who was also a good citizen having subscribed
five dollars to the carnival she did not propose to lose the worth
of her money neither did she intend to lose a chance to do business
Perhaps there was an obscurer and more complex motive lurking in some
stray corner of that queer garret a womans mind Such motivesaimless
softenings of the heart unprofitable diversions of the fancywill seep
unconsciously through the toughest business principles of woman

She was puzzled by the look of exaltation on Nelsons features
illumined as they were by the uncanny light If the fool man had not
forgotten all his troubles just to see a few fireworks No he was not
that kind of a fool maybeand she almost laughed aloud in her pleasure
over her own insightmaybe it all made him think of the war where
he had been so brave He was a regular hero in the war Miss Brown
concluded and he certainly is a perfect gentleman what a pity he
hasnt got any sense

She had guessed aright although she had not guessed deep enough in
regard to Nelson He watched the great wheels of light he watched the
river aflame with Greek fire then with a shiver he watched the bombs
bursting into myriads of flowers into fizzing snakes into fields of
burning gold into showers of jewels that made the night splendid for
a second and faded They were not fireworks to him they were a magical
phantasmagoria that renewed the incoherent and violent emotions of his
youth again he was in the chaos of the battle or he was dreaming by
his campfire or he was pacing his lonely round on guard His heart
leaped again with the old glow the wonderful beautiful worship of
Liberty that can do no wrong He seemed to hear a thousand voices
chanting

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea As He died
to make men holy let us die to make men free


His turbid musings clearedor they seemed to him to clearunder the
strong reaction of his imagination and his memories It was all over
the dream and the glory thereof The splendid young soldier was an
elderly ruined man But one thing was left he could be true to his
flag

A poor soldier but enlisted for the war says Nelson squaring his
shoulders with a lump in his throat and his eyes brimming I know by
the way it hurts me to think of refusing her that its a temptation to
wrongdoing No I cant save myself by sacrificing a brother soldier
for humanity She is just as kind as she can be but women dont
understand business she wouldnt make allowance for Richards

He felt a hand on his shoulder it was Martin apologizing for hurrying
Miss Brown but the baby was fretting and

Im sorryyeswell I wish you didnt have to go Nelson began but
a hoarse treble rose from under his elbows Say Mr Martin Uncle and
me can take Miss Brown home

If you will allow me the pleasure said Nelson with the touch of
courtliness that showed through his homespun ways

Well I WOULD like to see the hundred bombs bursting at once and Vulcan
at his forge said Miss Brown

Thus the matter arranged itself Tim waited with the lady while Nelson
went for the horse nor was it until afterward that Miss Brown wondered
why the lad did not go instead of the man But Tim had his own reasons
No sooner was Nelson out of earshot than he began Say Miss Brown I
can tell you something

Yes

That Richards is no good but you cant get Uncle to see it At least
it will take time If youll help me we can get him round in time Wont
you please not sell us out for six months and give me a show Ill see
you get your interest and your money too

You Miss Brown involuntarily took a business attitude with her arms
akimbo and eyed the boy

Yes maam me I aint so very old but I know all about the business
I got all the figures downhow much we raise and what we got last year
I can fetch them to you so you can see He is a good farmer and he will
catch on to the melons pretty quick Well do better next year and Ill
try to keep him from belonging to things and spending money and if he
wont lend to anybody or start in raising a new kind of crop just when
we get the melons going he will make money sure He is awful good and
honest All the trouble with him is he needs somebody to take care
of him If Aunt Lizzie had been alive he never would have lent that
deadbeat Richards that money He ought to get married

Miss Brown did not feel called on to say anything Tim continued in a
judicial way He is awful good and kind always gets up in the morning
to make the fire if I have got something else to do and hed think
everything his wife did was the best in the world and if he had
somebody to take care of him hed make money I dont suppose YOU would
think of it This last in an insinuating tone with evident anxiety

Well I never said Miss Brown

Whether she was more offended or amused she couldnt tell and she stood
staring at him by the electric light To her amazement the hard little
face began to twitch I didnt mean to mad you Tim grunted with a
quiver in his rough voice Ive been listening to every word you
said and I thought you were so sensible youd talk over things without
nonsense Of course I knew hed have to come and see you Saturday
nights and take you buggy riding and take you to the theatre and
all such thingsfirst But I thought we could sorter fix it up between
ourselves Ive taken care of him ever since Aunt Lizzie died and I did
my best he shouldnt lend that money but I couldnt help it and I
did keep him from marrying a widow woman with eight children who kept
telling him how much her poor fatherless children needed a man and I
never did see anybody I was willingbeforeand itsits so lonesome
without Aunt Lizzie He choked and frowned Poor Tim who had sold so
many melons to women and seen so much of back doors and kitchen humors
that he held the sex very cheap he did not realize how hard he would
find it to talk of the one woman who had been kind to him He turned red
with shame over his own weakness

You poor little chap cried Miss Brown you poor little sharp
innocent chap The hand she laid on his shoulder patted it as she went
on Never mind if I cant marry your uncle I can help you take care
of him Youre a real nice boy and Im not mad dont you think it
Theres your uncle now

Nelson found her so gentle that he began to have qualms lest his
carefully prepared speech should hurt her feelings But there was no
help for it now I have thought over your kind offer to me maam
said he humbly and I got a proposition to make to you It is your
honest due to have your farm yes maam Well I know a man would like
to buy it Ill sell it to him and pay you your money

But that wasnt my proposal

I know it maam I honor you for your kindness but I cant risk
whatwhat might be another persons idea of duty about Richards Our
consciences aint all equally enlightened you know

Miss Brown did not answer a word

They drove along the streets where the lanterns were fading Tim grew
uneasy she was silent so long On the brow of the hill she indicated a
side street and told them to stop the horse before a little brown house
One of the windows was a dim square of red

It isnt quite so lonesome coming home to a light said Miss Brown

As Nelson cramped the wheel to jump out to help her from the vehicle
the light from the electric arc fell full on his handsome face and
showed her the look of compassion and admiration there

Wait one moment she said detaining him with one firm hand Ive got
something to say to you Let Richards go for the present all I ask of
you about him is that you will do nothing until we can find out if he
is so bad off But Mr Forrest I can do better for you about that
mortgage Mr Lossing will take it for three years for a relative of his
and pay me the money I told him the story

And YOU will get the money all right

Just the same I was only trying to help you a little by the other way
and I failed Never mind

I cant tell you how you make me feel said Nelson

Please let him bring you some melons tomorrow and make a stagger at
it though said Tim

Can I Nelsons eyes shone

If you want to said Miss Brown She laughed but in a moment she
smiled

All the way home Nelson saw the same face of Failure between the old
mares white ears but its grim lineaments were softened by a smile a
smile like Miss Browns




TOMMY AND THOMAS

IT was while Harry Lossing was at the High School that Mrs Carriswood
first saw Tommy Fitzmaurice He was not much to see a long lad of
sixteen who had outgrown his jackets and was not yet grown to his ears

At this period Mrs Fitzmaurice was his barber and she having been too
rash with the shears in one place had snipped off the rest of his curly
black locks to match until he showed a perfect convicts poll giving
his ears all the better chance and bringing out the rather square
contour of his jaws to advantage He had the true IrishNorman face a
skin of fine texture fair and freckled high cheekbones straight nose
and wide blue eyes that looked to be drawn with ink because of their
sharply pencilled brows and long thick black lashes But the
feature that Mrs Carriswood noticed was Tommys mouth a flexible and
delicately cut mouth of which the lips moved lightly in speaking and
seldom were quite in repose

The genuine Irish orators mouth thought Mrs Carriswood

Tommy however was not a finished orator and Mrs Carriswood herself
deigned to help him with his graduating oration Tommy delivering the
aforesaid oration from memory on the stage of the Grand Opera House
to a warmhearted and perspiring audience of his townspeople amid
tremendous applause and not the slightest proddings of conscience

Really the speech deserved the applause Mrs Carriswood who had heard
half the eloquence of the world spent three evenings on it and she has
a good memory

Her part in the affair always amused her though in fact it came to
pass easily She had the great fortune of the family Being a widow with
no children and the time not being come when philanthropy beckons on
the right hand and on the left to freehanded women Mrs Carriswood
travelled As she expressed it she was searching the globe for a
perfect climate Not that I in the least expect to find it said she
cheerfully but I like to vary my disappointments when I get worn out
being frozen winters I go somewhere to be soaked She was on her way
to California this time with her English maid who gave the Lossing
domestics many a jolly moment by her inextinguishable panic about red
Indians Mrs Derry supposed these savages to be lurking on the prairie
outside every Western town and almost fainted when she did chance
to turn the corner upon three Kickapoo Indians splendid in paint and
feathers and peacefully vending the Famous Kickapoo Sagwa She had
others of the artless notions of the travelling English and I fear that
they were encouraged not only by the cook the second girl and the
manofallwork but by Harry and his chum Tommy I know she used to
tell how she saw tame buffalo roosting on the streets wich they do
look that like common cows a body couldnt tell em hapart

She had a great opinion of Tommy a mystery to her mistress for a long
time until one day it leaked out that Tommy and Master Harry too
had told her that Tommys greatgrandfather was a lord in the old
country

The family seem to have sunk in the world since Derry was Mrs
Carriswoods single remark as she smiled to herself After Derry was
dismissed she picked up a letter written that day to a friend of hers
and read some passages about Harry and Tommy smiling again

Harryone may look over her pretty shoulder without impertinence in
a storyHarry she wrote is a boy that I long to steal Just the
kind of boy we have both wanted Sarahfrank happy affectionate I
must tell you something about him It came out by accident He has the
Western business instincts and what do you suppose he did He actually
started a wee shop of his own in the corner of the yard really it is
a surprisingly pretty place and they are quite civilized in the house
gas hot water steam heat all most comfortable and sold pop and
candy and cakes to the boys He made so much money that he proposed a
partnership to the cook and the setting up a little booth in the county
fair which is like our rural cattle shows you know The cook a
superior person who borrows books from Mrs Lossing but seems very
decent and respectful notwithstanding and broils game to perfection
And SUCH game as we have here Sarahwell the cook made him
creamcakes sandwiches tarts and candy and Harry honorably bought
all the provisions with his profits from the first venture You will
open your eyes at his father permitting such a thing but Henry Lossing
is a thorough Westerner in some ways and he looks on it all as a joke
Might show the boy how to do business he says

Well they had a ravishing display so Alma the cook and William the
man assured meper Derry All the sadder its fate for alas a gang
of rowdy boys fell upon Harry and while he was busy fighting half of
themhe is as plucky as his uncle the generalthe other half looted
the beautiful stock in trade They would have despoiled our poor little
merchant entirely but for the opportune arrival of a schoolmate who
is mightily respected by the rowdies He knocked one of them down and
shouted after the others that he would give every one of them a good
thrashing if they did not bring the plunder back and as he is known to
be a lad of his word for good or evil actually the scamps did return
most of the booty which the two boys brushed off and sold as far as it
went  The consequence of the fray has been that Harry is unboundedly
grateful to this Tommy Fitzmaurice and is at present coaching him on
his graduating oration Fitzmaurice has studied hard and won honors and
wants to make a show with his oration to please his father You see
says Harry Tommys father has saved money and is spending it all on
Tommy sos he can be educated He needs Tommy in the business real
bad but he wont let him come in he keeps him at school and he thinks
everything of his getting the valedictory and Tommy he worked nights
studying to get it When I asked what was the fathers business Harry
grew a bit confused Well he kept a saloon butHarry hastened to
explainit was a very nice saloon never any trouble with the police
there why Tommy knew every man on the force And they keep good
liquors too said Harry earnestly throw away all the beer left in
the glasses What else would they do with it asked innocent I Why
keep it in a bucket said Harry solemnly and then slip the glass
under the counter and half fill out of the bucket then hold it under
the keg LOW sos the foam will come thats a trick of the trade you
know Tommy says his father would SCORN that There is a vista opened
isnt there I was rather shocked at such associates for Harry and told
his mother Did she think it a good idea to have such a boy coming to
the house a saloonkeepers son She did not laugh as I half expected
but answered quite seriously that she had been looking up Tommy that
he was very much attached to Harry and that she did not think he would
teach him anything bad He has I find myself notions of honor though
they are rather the code of the street And he picks up things quickly
Once he came to tea It was amusing to see how he glued his eyes on
Harry and kept time with his motions He used his fork quite properly
only as Harry is a lefthanded little fellow the righthanded Thomas
had the more difficulty

He is taking such vast pains with his oration that I felt moved to
help him The subject is The Triumph of Democracy and Tommy civilly
explained that democracy did not mean the Democratic party but just
only a government where all the poor folks can get their rights and can
vote

The oration was the kind of spreadeagle thing you might expect I
can see that Tommy has formed himself on the orators of his fathers
respectable saloon What he said in comment interested me more Sure I
guess it is the best government maam though of course I got to make
it out that way anyhow But we come from Ireland and there they got
the other kind and me granny she starved in the famine time she did
thatwith the fever Me father walked twenty mile to the Sackvilles
place where they gave him some meal though he wasnt one of their
tenants yes and the lady told him how he would be cooking it I never
will forget that lady

I saw a dramatic opportunity would Tommy be willing to tell that story
in his speech He looked at me with an odd lookor so I imagined it
Why not says he Id as soon as not tell it to anyone of them and
why not to them all together Well why not when you come to think
of it So we have got it into the speech and I I myself Sarah am
drilling young Demosthenes and he is so apt a scholar that I find
myself rather pleasantly employed Having read her letter Mrs
Carriswood hesitated a second and then added Derrys information at
the bottom of the page I suppose the lordly ancestor was one of King
Jamess creationsee Macaulay somewhere in the second volume I dare
say there is a drop or two of good blood in the boy He has the manners
of a gentlemanbut I dont know that I ever saw an Irishman no matter
how low in the social scale who hadnt

Thus it happened that Tommys valedictory scored a success that is a
tradition of the High School and came to be printed in both the city
papers copies of which journals Tommys mother has preserved sacredly
to this day and I have no doubt could one find them they would be
found wrapped around a yellow photograph of the A Class of 1870 eight
pretty girls in white smiling among five solemn boys in black and
Tommy himself as the valedictorian occupying the centre of the picture
in his new suit of broadcloth with a rose in his buttonhole and his
hair cut by a professional barber for the occasion

It was the story of the famine that really captured the audience and
Tommy told it well with the true Irish fire in a beautiful voice

In the front seat of the parquette a little old man in a wrinkled black
broadcloth with a bald head and a fringe of whisker under his long
chin and a meek little woman in a red Paisley shawl wept and laughed
by turns They had taken the deepest interest in every essay and every
speech The old man clapped his large hands which were encased in
loose black kid gloves with unflagging vigor He wore a pair of heavy
boots the soles of which made a noble thud on the floor

Aint it wonderful the like of them young craters can talk like that
he cried shure Molly that young lady whod the essaywhere is
ita huge black forefinger travelled down the page_Music The
Turkish Patrol_ Nothough thats grand that piece Ill be spakin
wid Professor Von Keinmitz to bring it when weve the opening Here
tis Molly _Tin Essay The Darkest Night Brings Out the Stars
Miss Mamie Odenheimer_ Thrue for you mavourneen And the sintiments
wasnt they illigant and the langwidge was as foine as Pat Ronans
speeches or Fatherwhist will ye look at the flowers that shlip of a
gyirls gitting Count em will ye

Fourteen bouquets and wan basket says the little woman and Mamie
Odenheimer she got seventeen bouquets and two baskets and a sign
Well she looked anxious but smiled I know of siven bouquets Tommy
will git for sure And thats not countin what Harry Lossing will do
for him Hiven bless the good heart of him

Well I kin count four for him on wan seat says the man with a nod
of his head toward the gay heap in the womans lap barrin I aint
onvaygled into flinging some of thim to the young ladies

Harry Lossing in the seat behind with his mother and Mrs Carriswood
giggled at this and whispered in the latter ladys ear Thats Tommys
father and mother My arent they excited though And Tommys whites
a sheetfor fear hell disappoint them you know He has said his piece
over twice to me today hes so scared lest hell forget Ive got it
in my pocket and Im going behind when its his turn to prompt him
Did you see me winking at him it sort of cheers him up

He was almost as keen over the floral procession as the Fitzmaurices
themselves The Lossing garden had been stripped to the last bud and
levies made on the asparagusbed into the bargain and Mrs Lossing and
Alma and Mrs Carriswood and Derry and Susy Lossing had made bouquets
and baskets and wreaths and Harry had distributed them among friends
in different parts of the house I say Harry but complimented by Mrs
Carriswood he admitted ingenuously that it was Tommys idea

Tommy thought they would make more show that way says Harry and
they are all on the middle aisle so his father and mother can see them
Tim OHalloran has got one for him too and Mrs Macillarney and shes
got some splendid pinies Picked every last one Theyll make a show

But Harry knew nothing of the most magnificent of his friends trophies
until it undulated gloriously down the aisle above the heads of two
men white satin ribbons flying tinfoil shiningan enormous horseshoe
of roses and mignonette

The parents were both on their feet to crane their necks after it as it
passed them amid the plaudits

Oh it was YOU Cousin Margaret I know it was you cried Harry

He took the ladies over to the Fitzmaurices the minute that the diplomas
were given and directly Tommy joined them attended by two admiring
followers laden with the trophies Mrs OHalloran and Mrs Macillarney
and divers of the friends both male and female joined the circle
Tommy held quite a little court He shook hands with all the ladies
beginning with Mrs Carriswood who certainly never had found herself
before in such a company jammed between Alderman McGinniss resplendent
new tweeds and Mrs Macillarneys calico he affectionately embraced
his mother and he allowed himself to be embraced by Mrs Macillarney
and Mrs OHalloran while Patrick Fitzmaurice shook hands with the
alderman

Heres the lady that helped me on me piece father shes the lady
that sent me the horseshoe mother Like to make you acquainted with me
father and me mother Mr and Mrs Fitzmaurice Mrs Carriswood

In these words Tommy blushing and happy presented his happy parents

Sure Im proud to meet you maam said Fitzmaurice bowing while
his wife courtesied and wiped her eyes

They were very grateful but they were more grateful for the flowers
than for the oratorical drilling No doubt they thought that their Tommy
could have done as well in any case but the splendid horseshoe was
another matter

Ten years passed before Mrs Carriswood saw her pupil again During
those years the town had increased and prospered so had the Lossing Art
Furniture Works It was after Harry Lossing had disappointed his father
This is not saying that he had done anything out of the way he had
simply declined to be the fourth Harry Lossing on the rolls of Harvard
College Instead he proposed to enter the business and to begin by
learning his own trade He was so industrious he kept at it with such
energy that his first convert was his fatherno I am wrong Mrs
Carriswood was the first Mrs Lossing was not a convert SHE had
believed in Harry from the beginning But all this was years before Mrs
Carriswoods visit

Another of Master Harrys notions was his belief in the necessity of his
meddlingso his father put itin the affairs of the town the state
and the nation as well as those of the Lossing furniture company But
though he was pleased to make rather cynical fun of his sons
political enthusiasm esteeming it in a sense a diverting and therefore
reprehensible pursuit for a business man the elder Lossing had a
sneaking pride in it all the same He liked to bring out Harrys
political shrewdness

Fancy Margaret says he whom do you think Harry has brought over
to our side now The shrewdest ward politician in the townwhy you saw
him when he was a boyTommy Fitzmaurice

Then Mrs Carriswood remembered she asked amused how was Tommy and
where was he

Tommy Oh he went to the State university the old man was bound to
send him and he was more dutiful than some sons He was graduated with
honors and came back to a large readymade justice courts practice
Of course he drifted into criminal practice but he has made a fine
income out of that and is the shrewdest some folks say the least
scrupulous political manager in the county And so Harry you have
persuaded him to cast in his lot with the party of principle have you
and he is packing the primaries

I see nothing dishonest in our trying to get our friends out to vote at
the primaries sir

Of course not but he may not stop there However I want Bailey
elected and I am glad he will work for us whats his price

Harry blushed a little I believe he would like to be city attorney
sir said he and Mr Lossing laughed

Would he make a bad one asked Mrs Carriswood

He would make the best kind of a one replied Harry with youthful
fervor hes a ward politician and all that I know but he has it in
him to be an uncommon deal more And I say sir do you know that he
and the old man will take twentyfive thousand of the stock at par if we
turn ourselves into a corporation

How about this new license measure wont that bear a little bit hard
on the old man This from Mr Lossing who was biting his cigar in deep
thought

That will not prevent his doing his duty why the old man for very
pride will be the first to obey the law Youll SEE

Six months later they did see since it was mostly due to Fitzmaurices
efforts that the reform candidate was elected as a consequence Tommy
became prosecuting attorney and to the amazement of the critics made
the best prosecuting attorney that the city had ever known

It was during the campaign that Mrs Carriswood met him Her
goddaughter daughter of the friend to whom years ago she described
Tommy was with her This time Mrs Carriswood had recently added
Florida to her disappointments in climates and was back as she told
Mrs Lossing with a real sense of relief in a climate that was too bad
to make any pretensions

She had brought Miss Van Harlem to see the shops It may be that she
would not have been averse to Harry Lossings growing interested in
young Margaret She had seen a great deal of Harry while he was East at
school and he remained her first favorite while Margaret was as good
as she was pretty and had half a million of dollars in her own right
They had seen Harry and he was showing them through the different
buildings or shops when a man entered who greeted him cordially and
whom he presented to Mrs Carriswood It was Tommy Fitzmaurice grown
into a handsome young man He brought his heels together and made the
ladies a solemn bow Pleased to meet you ladies how do you like the
West said Tommy

His black locks curled about his ears which seemed rather small now
he had a good nose and a mobile cleanshaven face His hands were very
white and soft and the rim of linen above them was dazzling His black
frockcoat was buttoned snugly about his slim waist He brushed his face
with a fine silk handkerchief and thereby diffused the fragrance of the
best imported cologne among the odors of wood and turpentine A diamond
pin sparkled from his neckscarf The truth is he knew that the visitors
were coming and had made a state toilet He looks half like an actor
and half like a clergyman and he IS all a politician thought Mrs
Carriswood I dont think I shall like him any more While she
thought she was inclining her slender neck toward him and the gentlest
interest and pleasure beamed out of her beautiful dark eyes

We like the West but _I_ have liked it for ten years this is not my
first visit said Mrs Carriswood

I have reason to be glad for that madam I never made another speech
so good

He had remembered her she laughed I had thought that you would
forget

How could I when you have not changed at all

But you have says Mrs Carriswood hardly knowing whether to show the
young man his place or not

Yes maam naturally But I have not learned how to make a speech
yet

Ah but you make very good ones Harry tells me

Much obliged Harry No maam Harry is a nice boy but he doesnt
know I know there is a lot to learn and I guess a lot to unlearn and
I feel all outside I dont even know how to get at it I have wished a
thousand times that I could talk with the lady who taught me to speak in
the first place He walked on by her side talking eagerly You dont
know how many times I have felt I would give most anything for the
opportunity of just seeing you and talking with you those things you
said to me I always remembered He had a hundred questions evidently
stinging his tongue And some of them seemed to Mrs Carriswood very
apposite

Im on the outside of such a lot of things says he When I first
began to suspect that I was on the outside was when I went to the
High School and sometimes I was invited to Harrys that was my first
acquaintance with cultivated society You cant learn manners from
books maam I learned them at Harrys That ishe colored and
laughedI learned SOME Theres plenty left I know Then I went to
the University Some of the boys came from homes like Harrys and
some of the professors there used to ask us to their houses and I saw
engravings and oil paintings and heard the conversation of persons of
culture All this only makes me know enough to KNOW I am outside I can
see the same thing with the lawyers too There is a set of them that
are after another kind of things that think themselves above me and my
sort of fellows You know all the talk about this being a free and equal
country Thats the tallest kind of humbug madam It is that There are
sets one above another everywhere big bugs and little bugs if you
will excuse the expression And you cant influence the big ones without
knowing how they feel A fellow cant be poking in the dark in a speech
or anywhere else Now these fellows here they go into politics
sometimes and there I tell you we come the nearest to a fair
field and no favor It is the best fellow gets the prize therethe
sharpestwitted the nerviest and stanchest Oh talk of machine
politics all the soft chaps who aint willing to get up early in the
morning or to go out in the wet THEY howl about the primaries and
corruption let them get up and clean the primaries instead of holding
their noses Those fellows Im not nice enough for them but I can beat
them every time They make a monstrous racket in the newspapers but
when election comes on they cant touch side edge or bottom

Discoursing in this fashion with digressions to Harry in regard to the
machines the furniture and the sales that showed Mrs Carriswood that
he meant to keep an eye on his twenty odd thousand dollars he strolled
at her side To Miss Van Harlem he scarcely said three words In fact
he said exactly three words uttered as Miss Margarets silken skirts
swung too near a pot of varnish They were Look out miss and at the
same second Tommy who was in advance with really no call to know of
the danger turned on his heel and whisked the skirts away turning
back to pick up the sentence he had dropped

Tommy told Harry that Miss Van Harlem was a very handsome lady but
haughtylooking Then he talked for half an hour about the cleverness of
Mrs Carriswood

I am inclined to think Tommy will rise Mrs Carriswood was
describing the interview to her cousin the next day What do
you think he said to me last of all How said he does a man a
gentlemanit had a touch of the pathetic dont you know the little
hesitation he made on the wordhow does he show his gratitude to a
lady who has done him a great service Young or old I said Oh a
married lady he said very much admired who has been everywhere
Wasnt that clever of him I told him that a man usually sent a few
flowers You saw the basket todayevidently regardless of expense And
fancy there was a card a card with a gilt edge and his name written on
it

The card was his mothers She has visiting cards now and pays visits
once a year in a livery carriage Poor Mrs Fitzmaurice she is always
so scared and she is such a good soul Tommy is very good to her

How about the father Does he still keep that nice saloon

Yes but he talks of retiring They are not poor at all and Tommy is
their only child the others died It is hard on the old man to retire
for he isnt so very old in fact but if he once is convinced that
his calling stands in the way of Tommys career he wont hesitate a
second

Poor people said Mrs Carriswood do you know Grace I can see
Tommys future he will grow to be a boss a political boss He will
become rich by keeping your streets always being cleanedwhich means
never cleanand giving you the worst fire department and police to be
obtained for money and by and by a grateful machine will make him
mayor or send him to the Legislature very likely to Congress where he
will misrepresent the honest State of Iowa Then he will bloom out in a
social way and marry a gentlewoman and they will snub the old people
who are so proud of him

Well we shall see said Mrs Lossing I think better things of
Tommy So does Harry

Part of the prophecy was to be speedily fulfilled Two years later the
Honorable Thomas Fitzmaurice was elected mayor of his city elected by
the reform party on account of his eminent servicesand because he was
the only man in sight who had the ghost of a chance of winning Harrys
version was Tommy jests at his new principles but that is simply
because he doesnt comprehend what they are He laughs at reform in the
abstract but every concrete practical reform he is as anxious as I or
anybody to bring about And he will get them here too

He was as good as his word he gave the city an admirable
administration with neither fear nor favor Some of the boys still
clung to him these according to Harry were the better boys who
had the seeds of good in them and only needed opportunity and a leader
Tommy did not flag in zeal rather as the time went on and he soared
out of the criminal courts into big civil cases involving property
he grew up to the level of his admirers praises Tommy wrote Mr
Lossing presently is beginning to take himself seriously He has been
told so often that he is a young lion of reform that he begins to study
the role in dead earnest I dont talk this way to Harry who believes
in him and is training him for the representative for our district What
harm Verily his is the faith that will move mountains Besides Tommy
is now rich he must be worth a hundred thousand dollars which makes a
man of wealth in these parts It is time for him to be respectable

Notwithstanding this preparation Mrs Carriswood then giving
Washington the benefit of her doubts of climate was surprised one day
to receive a perfectly correct visiting card whereon was engraved Mr
Thomas Sackville Fitzmaurice MC

The young lady who was with her lifted her brilliant hazel eyes and half
smiled Is it the droll young man we met once at Mrs Lossings Pray
see him Aunt Margaret said Miss Van Harlem

Mrs Carriswood shrugged her shoulders and ordered the man to show him
up

There entered in the wake of the butler a distinguishedlooking
personage who held out his hand with a perfect copy of the bow that
she saw forty times a day He is taking himself very seriously she
sighed he is precisely like anybody else And she felt her interest
snuffed out by Tommys correctness But directly she changed her mind
the unfailing charm of his race asserted itself in Tommy she decided
that he was a delightful original young man and in ten minutes they
were talking in the same odd confidence that had always marked their
relation

How perfectly you are gotten up Are you INSIDE now

Ah do you remember that said he thats awfully good of you Which
is so fortunate as to please you my clothes or my deportment

Both They are very good Where did you get them Tommy I shall take
the privilege of my age and call you Tommy

Thank you The clothes Oh I asked Harry for the proper thing and he
recommended a tailor I think Harry gave me the manners too

And your new principles She could not resist this little fling

I owe a great deal in that way to Harry also answered he with
gravity

Gone were the days of sarcastic ridicule of visionary politics
Tommy talked of the civil service in the tone of Harry himself He was
actually eloquent

Why Aunt Margaret he is a remarkable young man exclaimed Miss Van
Harlem his honesty and enthusiasm are refreshing in this pessimist
place I hope he will come again Did you notice what lovely eyes he
has

Before long it was not pure goodnature that caused Mrs Carriswood to
ask Fitzmaurice to her house He was known as a rising young man One
met him at the best houses yet he was a prodigious worker and had made
his mark in committees before the celebrated speech that sent him into
all the newspaper columns or that stubborn and infinitely versatile
fight against odds which inspired the artist of PUCK

Tommy bore the cartoon to Mrs Carriswood beaming She had not seen
that light in his face since the memorable June afternoon in the
Operahouse He sent the paper to his mother who vowed the picture did
not favor Tommy at all at all Sure Tommy never had such a red nose
The old man however went to his exsaloon and sat in state all the
morning showing Tommys funny picture

It was about this time that Mrs Carriswood observed something that took
her breath away Tommy Fitzmaurice had the presumption to be attentive
to my ladys goddaughter Miss Van Harlem Nor was this the worst there
were indications that Miss Van Harlem who had refused the noble names
and titles of two or three continental nobles and the noble name
unaccompanied by a title of the younger son of an English earl without
mentioning the halfdozen nice American claimantsMiss Van Harlem was
not angry

The day this staggering blow fell on her Mrs Carriswood was in her
dressingroom peacefully watching Derry unpack a box from Paris in
anticipation of a state dinner And Miss Van Harlem in a bewitching
wrapper sat on the lounge and admired Upon this scene of feminine
peace and happiness enter the Destroyer in the shape of a note from
Tommy Fitzmaurice Were they going on Beatouns little excursion to
Alexandria If they were he would move heaven and earth to put off a
committee meeting in order to join them By the way he was to get the
floor for his speech that afternoon Wouldnt Mrs Carriswood come to
inspire him Perhaps Miss Van Harlem would not be bored by a little of
it

It was a wellworded note as Mrs Carriswood read it she realized
for the first time how completely Tommy was acclimated in society She
remembered his plaint years ago and his awe of oil paintings and
people of culture and she laughed halfsadly as she passed the note
over to Miss Van Harlem

I presume it is the Alexandria excursion that the Beatouns were talking
about yesterday she said languidly He wants to show that young
Irishman that we have a mild flavor of antiquity ourselves We are to
see Alexandria and have a real old Virginian dinner including one
of the famous Beatoun hams and some of the 69 Chateau Yquem and the
sacred 47 port I suppose he will have the fourinhand buckboard
A small party that will mean the Honorable Basil Sackville Mrs
Beatoun Lilly Denning probably one of the Cabinet girls Colonel
Turner and that young Russian Beatoun is so fond of Tommy
Fitzmaurice

Why do you always call Mr Fitzmaurice Tommythis interruption comes
with a slight rise of color from young Margaret

Everybody calls him Tommy in his own town a politician as popular as
he with the boys is naturally Tommy or Jerry or Billy They slap him on
the back or sit with an arm around his neck and concoct the ways to rule
us

I dont think anyone slaps Mr Fitzmaurice on the back and calls him
Tommy NOW says Margaret with a little access of dignity

I dare say his poor old father and mother dont venture on that
liberty I wish you had seen them

He has told me about them says Margaret

And Mrs Carriswoods dismay was such that for a second she simply
gasped Were things so far along that such confessions were made
Tommy must be very confident to venture it was shrewd very shrewd
to forestall Mrs Carriswoods sure revelationsoh Tommy was not a
politician for nothing

Besides Margaret went on with the same note of repressed feeling in
her voice his is a good family if they have decayed his ancestor was
Lord Fitzmaurice in King Jamess time

She takes HIM seriously too thought Mrs Carriswood with
inexpressible consternation what SHALL I say to her mother

Strange to say perhaps considering that she was so frankly a woman of
the world her stubbornest objection to Tommy was not an objection of
expediency She had insensibly grown to take his success for granted
like the rest of the Washington world he would be a governor a
senator he might beanything And he was perfectly presentable now
no it would be on the whole an investment in the future that would pay
well enough his parents would be awkward but they were old people not
likely to be too much _en evidence_

Mrs Carriswood while not overjoyed would not feel crushed by such a
match but she did view what she regarded as Tommys moral instability
with a dubious and fearful eye He was earnest enough for his new
principles now but what warrant was there of his sincerity Margaret
and her mother were highminded women It was the gallant knight of her
party and her political faith that the girl admired the valiant fight
not the triumph No mere soldier of fortune no matter how successful
or how brilliant could win her if Tommy were the mercenary not the
knight no worldly glory could compensate his wife

Wherefore after a bad quarter of an hour reflecting on these things
Mrs Carriswood went to the Capitol resolved to take her goddaughter
away She would not withdraw her acceptance of the Beatouns invitation
no let the Iowa congressman have every opportunity to display his
social shortcomings in contrast with the accomplished Russian and Jack
Turner the most elegant man in the army the next day would be time
enough for a telegram and a sudden flitting Yet in the midst of her
plans for Tommys discomfiture she was assailed by a queer regret and
reluctance Tommys fascination had affected even a professional critic
of life he had been so amusing so willing so trusting so useful
that her chill interest had warmed into liking She felt a moving of
the heart as the handsome black head arose and the first notes of that
resonant thrilling voice swelled above the din on the floor

It was the day of his great speech the speech that made him it was
said

As Mrs Carriswood sank back turning a little in an instinctive effort
to repulse her own sympathy she was aware of the presence near her
of an elderly man and woman The old man wore a shining silk hat and
shining new black clothes His expansive shirtbosom was very white but
not glossy and rumpled in places and his collar was of the spiked and
antique pattern known as a dickey His wrinkled red face was edged by
a white fringe of whisker He wore large goldbowed spectacles and his
jaws worked incessantly

The woman was a little mild wrinkled creature with an anxious blue
eye and snowy hair smoothed down over her ears under her fine bonnet
She was richly dressed but her silks and velvets ill suited the
season Had she seen them anywhere else Mrs Carriswood might not
have recognized them but there with Tommy before them both of them
feverishly absorbed in Tommy she recognized them at a glance She had
a twinge of pity watching the old faces pale and kindle With the first
rustle of applause she saw the old father slip his hand into the
old mothers They sat well behind a pillar and however excited they
became they never so lost themselves as to lean in front of their
shield This also she noticed The speech over the woman wiped her
eyes The old man joined in the tumult of applause that swept over the
galleries but the old woman pulled his arm evidently feeling that it
was not decent for them to applaud She sat rigid with red cheeks and
her eyes brimming he was swaying and clapping and laughing in a roar of
delight But it was he that drew her away finally while she fain would
have lingered to look at Tommy receiving congratulations below

Poor things said Mrs Carriswood I do believe they havent let him
know that they are here And she remembered how she had pitied them
for this very possibility of humiliation years before But she did not
pursue the adventure and some obscure motive prevented her speaking of
it to Miss Van Harlem

Did Tommys parents tell Tommy If they did Tommy made no sign The
morning found him with the others in a beautiful white flannel suit
with a silk shirt and a red silk sash looking handsomer than any man of
the party He took the congratulations of the company modestly Either
he was not much puffed up or he had the art of concealment

They saw Alexandria in a conscientious fashion for the benefit of the
guest of the day He was a modest young fellow with a nose rather too
large for his face a long upper lip and frank blue eyes He made
himself agreeable to one of the Cabinet girls on the front seat while
Tommy just behind him had Miss Van Harlem and bliss for his portion

The old streets the toppling roofs the musty warehouses the uneven
pavement all pleased the young creatures out in the sunshine They made
merry over the ancient ballroom where Washington had asked a faraway
ancestress of Beatoun to dance and they decorously walked through the
old church

IT happened in the church Mrs Carriswood was behind the others so she
saw them come in the same little old couple of the Capitol

In the chancel Beatoun was explaining beside Beatoun shone a curly
black head that they knew

Mrs Carriswood sat in one of the high old pews Through a crack she
could look into the next pew and there they stood She heard the old
man Whist Molly lets be getting out of this HE is here with all
his grand friends Dont let us be interrupting him

The old womans voice was so like Tommys that it made Mrs Carriswood
start Very softly she spoke I only want to look at him a minute Pat
jest a minute I aint seen him for so long

And is it any longer for you than for me retorted the husband Ye
know what ye promised if Id be taking you here unbeknownst Dont look
his way Look like ye was a stranger to him Dont let us be mortifying
him wid our country ways Like as not tis the prisidint himself he
is colloguein wid this blessed minute Shtep back and be a stranger to
him woman

A stranger to him his own mother But she stepped back she turned her
patient face ThenTommy saw her

A wave of red flushed all over his face He took two steps down the
aisle and caught the little figure in his arms

Why mother he cried why mother where did you drop from

And before Mrs Carriswood could speak she saw him step back and push
young Sackville forward crying This is my father this is the boy
that knew your grandmother

He did it so easily he was so entirely unaffected so perfectly
unconscious that there was nothing at all embarrassing for anyone Even
the Cabinet girl with a grandmother in very humble life who must be
kept in the background could not feel disconcerted

For this happy result Mrs Carriswood owns a share of the credit She
advanced on the first pause and claimed acquaintanceship with the
Fitzmaurices The story of their last meeting and Tommys first triumph
in oratory came of course the famous horseshoe received due mention
and Tommy described with much humor his terror of the stage From the
speech to its most effective passage was a natural transition equally
natural the transition to Tommys grandmother the Irish famine and the
benevolence of Lady Sackville

Everybody was interested and it was Sackville himself who brought the
Fitzmaurices noble ancestors the apocryphal Viscounts Fitzmaurice of
King Jamess creation on to the carpet

He was entirely serious My grandmother told me of your
greatgrandfather Lord Fitzmaurice she saw him ride to hounds once
when she was a little girl They say he was the boldest rider in
Ireland and a renowned duellist too King James gave the title to his
grandfather didnt he and the countryside kept it if it was given
rather too late in the day to be useful I am glad you have restored the
family fortunes Mr Fitzmaurice

The Cabinet girl looked on Tommy with respect and Miss Van Harlem
blushed like an angel

All is lost said Mrs Carriswood to herself yet she smiled Going
home she found a word for Tommys ear The old Virginian dinner had
been most successful The Fitzmaurices who had been almost forced into
the banquet by Beatouns imperious hospitality were not a wet blanket
in the least Patrick Fitzmaurice brogue and all was an Irish
gentleman without a flaw He blossomed out into a modest wag and told
two or three comic stories as acceptably as he was used to tell them to
a very different circleonly carrying a fresher flavor of wit to this
circle perhaps it enjoyed them more Mrs Fitzmaurice looked scared
and ate almost nothing with the greatest propriety and her fork in her
left hand Yet even she thawed under Miss Van Harlems attentions and
gentle Mrs Beatouns tact and the winning ways of the last Beatoun
baby She took this absent cherub to her heart with such undissembled
warmth that its mother ever since has called her a sweet funny little
old lady

They were both Patrick and his wife quite unassuming and retiring
and no urging could dissuade them from parting with the company at the
tavern door

My word Tommy your mother and I can git home by ourselves whispered
honest Patrick weve not exceededif the wines WERE good I never
exceeded in my life God take the glory

But he embraced Tommy so affectionately in parting that I confess Mrs
Carriswood had suspicions Yet surely it is more likely that his brain
waslet us not say TURNED but just a wee bit TILTED by the joy and
triumph of the occasion rather than by Beatouns port or champagne

But Mrs Carriswoods word had nothing to do with Tommys parents
ostensibly though in truth it had everything to do She said Will
you dine with us tomorrow quite _en famille_ Thomas

I ought to tell you I suppose that I find your house a pretty
dangerous paradise Mrs Carriswood says Tommy

And I find you a most dangerous angel Thomas butyou see I ask you

Thank you answers Tommy in a different tone youve always been
an angel to me What I owe to you and Harry Lossingwell I cant
talk about it But see here Mrs Carriswood you always have called me
Tommy now you say Thomas why this state

I think you have won your brevet Thomas

He looked puzzled and she liked him the better that he should not make
enough of his conduct to understand her but though she has called him
Tommy often since he keeps the brevet in her thoughts In fact Mrs
Carriswood is beginning to take the Honorable Thomas Fitzmaurice and his
place in the world seriously herself




MOTHER EMERITUS

THE Louders lived on the second floor at the head of the stairs in the
Lossing Building There is a restaurant to the right and a new doctor
every six months who is every kind of a healer except regular keeps
the permanent boarders in gossip to the left two or three dressmakers
a dentist and a diamond merchant upstairs one flight and half a
dozen families and a dozen single tenants higherso you see the Louders
had plenty of neighbors In fact the multitude of the neighbors is one
cause of my story

Tilly Louder came home from the Lossing factory where she is a
typewriter one February afternoon As she turned the corner she was
face to the river which is not so full of shipping in winter that one
cannot see the steelblue glint of the water Back of her the brick
paved street climbed the hill under a shapeless arch of trees The
remorseless pencil of a railway has drawn black lines at the foot of
the hill and all day and all night slender red bars rise and sink
in their black sockets to the accompaniment of the outcry of tortured
steam All day if not all night the crooked pole slips up and down the
trolley wire as the yellow cars rattle and flash and clang a spiteful
little bell that sounds like a soprano bark over the crossings

It is customary in the Lossing Building to say We are so handy to the
cars The street is a handsome street not free from dingy old brick
boxes of stores below the railway but fast replacing them with fairer
structures The Lossing Building has the wide arches the recessed
doors the balconies and the colonnades of modern business architecture
The occupants are very proud of the balconies in particular and
summer days these will be a mass of greenery and bright tints Today
it was so warm February day though it was that some of the potted
plants were sunning themselves outside the windows

Tilly could see them if she craned her neck There were some bouvardias
and fuchsias of her mothers among them

It IS a pretty building said Tilly and for some reason she
frowned

She was a young woman but not a very young woman Her figure was slim
and she looked better in loose waists than in tightly fitted gowns She
wore a dark green gown with a black jacket and a scarlet shirtwaist
underneath Her face was long with square chin and high cheekbones
and thin firm lips yet she was comely because of her lustrous black
hair her clear gray eyes and her charming fair skin She had another
gift everything about her was daintily neat at first glance one said
Here is a person who has spent pains if not money on her toilet

By this time Tilly was entering the Lossing Building Halfway up the
stairway a hand plucked her skirts The hand belonged to a tiredfaced
woman in black on whose breast glittered a little crowd of pins and
threaded needles like the insignia of an Order of Toil

Please excuse me Miss Tilly said the woman at the same time
presenting a flat package in brown paper but WILL you give this
pattern back to your mother I am so very much obliged I dont know how
I WOULD git along without your mother Tilly

Ill give the pattern to her said Tilly and she pursued her way

Not very far A stout woman and a thin young man with long wavy red
hair awaited her on the landing The woman held a plate of cake which
she thrust at Tilly the instant they were on the same level saying
The cake was just splendid tell your mother its a lovely recipe and
will you tell her to take this and see how well I succeeded

AndahMiss Louder said the man as the stout woman rustled away
here are some _Banner of Lights_ I think shed be interested in some
of the articles on the true principles of the inspirational
faith Tilly placed the bundle of newspapers at the base of her
loadandand I wish youd tell your dear mother that under the
angels her mustard plaster really saved my life

Ill tell her said Tilly

She had advanced a little space before a young girl in a bright blue
silk gown flung a radiant presence between her and the door Oh
Miss Tilly she murmured blushing will you just give your mother
thisitsits Jims photograph You tell her its ALL right and SHE
was exactly right and _I_ was wrong Shell understand

Tilly with a look of resignation accepted a stiff package done up in
white tissue paper She had now only three steps to take she took two
only two forMiss Tilly PLEASE a voice pealed around the corner
while a flushed and breathless young woman with a large baby toppling
over her lean shoulder staggered into view My she panted aint it
tiresome lugging a child I missed the car of course coming home
from mas Oh say Tilly your mother was so good she said shed tend
Blossom next time I went to the doctors and

Ill take the baby said Tilly She hoisted the infant on to her own
shoulder with her right arm Perhaps youll be so kinds to turn the
handle of the door said she in a slightly caustic tone as I havent
got any hands left Please shut it too

As the young mother opened the door Tilly entered the parlor For a
second she stood and stared grimly about her The furniture of the room
was oldfashioned but in the best repair There was a cabinet organ in
one corner A crayon portrait of Tillys father killed in the civil
war glared out of a florid gilt frame Perhaps it was the fault of the
portrait but he had a peevish frown There were two other portraits of
him large ghastly gray tintypes in oval frames of rosewood obscurely
suggesting coffins In these he looked distinctly sullen He was
represented in uniform being a lieutenant of volunteers and the
artist had conscientiously gilded his buttons until as Mrs Louder
was wont to observe It most made you want to cut them off with the
scissors There were other tintypes and a flock of photographs in the
room What Mrs Louder named a throw decorated each framed picture and
each chair The largest armchair was drawn up to a table covered with
books and magazines in the chair sat Mrs Louder reading

At Tillys entrance she started and turned her head and then one could
see that the tears were streaming down her cheeks

Now MOTHER exploded Tilly Kicking the door open she marched into
the bedchamber An indignant sweep of one arm sent the miscellany of
gifts into a rockingchair an indignant curve of the other landed the
baby on the bed Tilly turned on her mother Now mother what did
you promiseHUSH will you The latter part of the sentence a fierce
ASIDE to the infant on the bed In a second Mrs Louders arms were
encircling him and she was soothing him on her broad shoulder where I
know not how many babies have found comfort

Jane Louder was a tall womantall and portly She had a massive repose
about her a kind of soft dignity and a stranger would not guess how
tender was her heart Deprecatingly she looked up at her only child
standing in judgment over her Her eyes were fine still though they had
sparkled and wept for more than half a century They were not gray like
Tillys but a deep violet with black eyelashes and eyebrows Black
once had been the hair under the widows cap now streaked with
silver but Jane Louders skin was fresh and daintily tinted like her
daughters for all its fine wrinkles Her voice when she spoke was
mellow and slow with a nervous vibration of apology Never mind
dear she said I was just reading bout the Russians

I KNEW it You promised me you wouldnt cry about the Russians any
more

I know Tilly but Alma Brown lent this to me herself Theres a
beautiful article in it about The Horrors of Hunger It would make
your heart ache I wish you would read it Tilly

No thank you I dont care to have my heart ache Im not going to
read any more horrors about the Russians or hear them either if I can
help it I have to write Mr Lossings letters about them and thats
enough Ive given all I can afford and youve given more than you can
afford and I helped get up the subscription at the shops Ive done all
I could and now I aint going to have my feelings harrowed up any more
when it wont do me nor the Russians a mite of good

But I caynt HELP it Tilly I caynt take any comfort in my meals
thinking of that awful black bread the poor children starve rather than
eat and Tilly they aint so dirty as some folks think I read in a
magazine how they have GOT to bathe twice a week by their religion and
theres a bathhouse in every village Tilly do you know how much money
theyve raised here

Over three thousand This town is the greatest town for givinggive
to the cholera down South give to Johnstown give to Grinnell give to
cyclones give to fires _The Freeman_ always starts up a subscription
and Mr Bayard runs the thing and Mr Lossing always gives Mother
I tell you HE makes them hustle when he takes hold Hes the chairman
here and he has township chairmen appointed for every township Hes
so popular they start in to oblige him and then someway he makes them
all interested I must tell you of a funny letter he had today from
a Captain Ferguson out at Baxter Hes a rich farmer with lots of
influence and a great worker Mr Lossing says But this is most word
for word what he wrote Dear Sir I am sorry for the Russians but my
wife is down with the la grippe and I cant get a hired girl so I have
to stay with her If youll get me a hired girl Ill get you a lot of
money for the Russians

Did he git a girl I mean Mr Lossing

No maam He said hed try if it was the city but it was easier
finding goldmines than girls that would go into the country See here
Im forgetting your presents Mother you look real dragged andqueer

Its nothing jist a thought kinder struck me boutbout that girl

Tilly was sorting out the parcels and explaining them at the end of her
task her mind harked back to an old grievance Mother said she Ive
been thinking for a long time and Ive made up my mind

Yes dearie Mrs Louders eyes grew troubled She knew something of
the quality of Tillys mind which resembled her fathers in a peculiar
immobility Once let her decision run into any mould be it whatsoever
it might and let it stiffen there was no chance any more than with
other iron things of its bending

Positively I could hardly get up the stairs today said Tillyshe was
putting her jacket and hat away in her orderly fashion of necessity
her back was to Mrs Louderthere was such a raft of people wanting to
send stuff and messages to you You are just working yourself to death
and mother I am convinced we have _got to move_

Mrs Louder dropped into a chair and gasped The baby who had fallen
asleep stirred uneasily It was not a pretty child its face was heavy
its little cheeks were roughened by the wind its lower lip sagged
its chin creased into the semblance of a fat old mans But Jane Louder
gazed down on it with infinite compassion She stroked its head as she
spoke

Tilly said she Ive been in this block Mrs Carleton and me ever
since it was built and some way between us weve managed to keep
the run of all the folks in it at least when they were in any trouble
Weve worked together like sisters Shes Piscopal and I guess Im
Unitarian but never a word between us We tended the Willardses through
diphtheria and the Hopkinses through smallpox and we steamed and
fumigated the rooms together It was her first found out the Dillses
were letting that twelveyearold child run the gasoline stove and
she threatened to tell Mr Lossing and they begged off and when it
exploded we put it out together with flour out of her flourbarrel for
the poor shiftless things hadnt half a sack full of their own and her
and me we took half the care of that little neglected Ellis baby that
was always sitting down in the sticky flypaper poor innocent child
Hes took the valedictory at the High School Tilly now No Tilly I
couldnt bring myself to leave this building where Ive married them
and buried them and born them you may say being with so many of their
mothers I feel like they was all my children Dont ASK me

Tillys head went upward and backward with a little dilatation of the
nostrils Now mother said she in a voice of determined gentleness
just listen to me Would I ask you to do anything that wouldnt be for
your happiness I have found a real pretty house up on Fifteenth Street
and well keep house together just as cosey and have a woman come to
wash and iron and scrub so it wont be a bit hard and be right on the
streetcars and you wont have to drudge helping Mrs Carleton extra
times with her restaurant

But Tilly eagerly interrupted Mrs Louder you know I dearly love
to cook and she PAYS me I couldnt feel right to take any of the
pension money or the little property your father left me away from
the house expenses but what I earn myself it is SUCH a comfort to give
away out of THAT

Tilly ran over and kissed the agitated face You dear generous
mother cried she ILL give you all the money you want to spend or
give I got another rise in my salary of five a month Dont you worry

You aint thinking of doing anything right away Tilly

Dont you think its best done and over with after weve decided
mother You have worked so hard all your life I want to give you some
ease and peace now

But Tilly I love to work I wouldnt be happy to do nothing and Id
get so fleshy

Tilly only laughed She did not crave the show of authority Let her
but have her own way she would never flaunt her victories She was
imperious but she was not arrogant For months she had been pondering
how to give her mother an easier life and she set the table for supper
in a filial glow of satisfaction never dreaming that her mother in the
kitchen was keeping her head turned from the stove lest she should cry
into the fried ham and stewed potatoes But at a sudden thought Jane
Louder laid her big spoon down to wipe her eyes

Here you are Jane Louderthus she addressed herselfmourning
and grieving to leave your friends and be laid aside for a useless old
woman and jist be taken care of and you clean forgetting the chance
the Lord gives you to help moren you ever helped in your life For
shame

A smile of exaltation of lofty resolution erased the worry lines on
her face Why it might be to save twenty lives said she but in the
very speaking of the words a sharp pain wrenched her heart again and
she caught up the baby from the floor where he sat in a wall of chairs
and sobbed over him Oh how can I go away when I got to go for good so
soon I want every minnit

She never thought of disputing Tillys wishes Its only fair said
Jane Shes lived here all these years to please me and now I ought to
be willing to go to please her

Neither did she for a moment hope to change Tillys determination
She was the settest baby ever was thought poor Jane tossing on her
pillow in the night watches and its grown with every inch of her

But in the morning she surprised her daughter Tilly said she at the
breakfasttable Tilly I got something I must do and I dont want you
to oppose me

Good gracious ma said Tilly as if I ever opposed you

You know how bad I have been feeling about the poor Russians

Well

And how Ive wished and wished I could do somethingsomething to
COUNT I never could Tilly because I aint got the money or the
intellect but sposing I could do it for somebody else like this
Captain Ferguson who could do so much if he just could get a hired girl
to take care of his wife Well I do know how to cook and to keep a
house neat and to do for the sick

Tilly could restrain herself no longer her voice rose to a shout of
dismayMother Louder you AINT thinking of going to be the Fergusons
_hired girl_

Not their hired girl Tilly just their help so as he can work for
those poor starving creatures Jane strangled a sob in her throat
Tilly in a kind of stupor of bewilderment frowned at her plate Then
her clouded face cleared If Mrs Louder had surprised her daughter her
daughter repaid the surprise Well if you feel that way mother said
she I wont say a word and Ill ask Mr Lossing to explain to the
Fergusons and fix everything He will

Youre real good Tilly

And while youre gone I guess it will be a good plan to move and git
settled

For some reason Tillys throat felt dry she lifted her cup She did not
intend to look across the table but her eyes escaped her She set the
coffee down untasted The clock was slow she muttered and she left the
room

Jane Louder remained in her place with the same pale face staring at
the tablecloth

It dont seem like I COULD go now she thought dully to herself the
times so awful short I dont spose Maria Carleton can git up to see
me moren once or twice a month busy as she is I got so to depend on
seeing her every day A sister couldnt be kinder I dont see how I am
going to bear it And to go away beforehand

For a long while she sat her face hardly changing At last when she
did push her chair away her lips were tightly closed She spoke to the
little pile of books lying on the table in the corner I cayntthese
are my own and you are strangers She walked across the room to take up
the same magazine which Tilly had found her reading the day before
When she began reading she looked sternpoor Jane she was steeling her
heartbut in a little while she was sniffing and blowing her nose
With a groan she flung the book aside Its no use I would feel like a
murderer if I dont go said she

She did go Harry Lossing made all the arrangements Tilly was
satisfied But then Tilly had not heard Harrys remark to his mother
Alma says Miss Louder is trying to make the old lady move against her
will I dare say it would be better to give the young woman a chance to
miss her mother and take a little quiet think

Tilly saw her mother off on the train to Baxter the Fergusons station
Being a provident farsighted and also inexperienced traveller she
had allowed a full halfhour for preliminary passages at arms with the
railway officials and as the train happened to be an hour late she
found herself with time to spare even after she had exhausted the
catalogue of possible deceptions and catastrophes by rail During the
silence that followed her last warning she sat mentally keeping tally
on her fingers Confidence menTilly began with the thumbNever
give anybody her check Never lend anybody money Never write her
name to anything Dont get out till conductor tells her In case of
accident telegraph me and keep in the middle of the car off the
trucks Not take care of anybodys baby while she goes off for a minute
Not take care of babies at all Or children Not talk to strangersgood
gracious

Tilly felt a movement of impatience there after all her cautions
there was her mother helping an old woman an utterly strange old woman
to pile a birdcage on a bandbox surmounting a bag The old woman was
clad in a black alpaca frock made with the voluminous draperies of
years ago but with the uncreased folds and the brilliant gloss of a
new gown She wore a bonnet of a singular shape unknown to fashion but
made out of good velvet Beneath the bonnet which was large appeared
a little round agitated old face with bobbing white curls and white
teeth set a little apart in the mouth a defect that brought a kind of
palpitating frankness into the expression

Now who HAS mother picked up now thought Tilly Well praise be
she hasnt a baby anyhow

She could hear the talk between the two for the old woman being deaf
Mrs Louder elevated her voice and the old woman herself spoke in a
high thin pipe that somehow reminded Tilly of a lost lamb

Thats just so said Mrs Louder a body caynt help worrying over a
sick child especially if theyre away from you

Solon and Minnie wouldnt tell me bleated the other woman they knew
Id worry Kinder hurt me they should keep things from me but they
hate to have me upset They are awful good children But I suspicioned
something when Alonzo kept writing Minnie she wouldnt tell me but
I pinned her down and it come out Eliza had the grip bad And then
nothing would do but I must go to herwhy Mrs Louder shes my child
But they wouldnt hark to it Fraid to have me travel alone

I guess they take awful good care of you said Mrs Louder and she
sighed

Yes maam awful She too sighed

As she talked her eyes were darting about the room eagerly fixed on
every new arrival

Are you expecting anyone Mrs Higbee said Jane They seemed at
least to know each other by name thought Tilly it was amazing the
number of people mother did know

No said Mrs Higbee IIfact is Im kinder frightened Ifact
is Mrs Louder I guess Ill tell you though I dont know you very
well but Ive known about you so longI run away and didnt tell
em I just couldnt stay way from Liza And I took the birdfor the
children and its my bird and I was fraid Minnie would forget to feed
it and it would be lonesome My children are awful kind good children
but they dont understand And if Solon sees me he will want me to go
back I know Im dretful foolish and Solon and Minnie will make me see
I am There wont be no good reason for me to go and Ill have to stay
and I feel as if I should FLYOh massy sakes theres Solon coming
down the street

She ran a few steps in half a dozen ways then fluttered back to her bag
and her cage

Well said Mrs Louder drawing herself up to her full height you
SHALL go if you want to

Solon will find me hell know the birdcage Oh dear Oh dear

Then a most unexpected helper stepped upon the stage What is the
mysterious instinct of rebellion to authority that nine cases out of
ten sends us to the aid of a fugitive Tilly the unconscious despot of
her own mother promptly aided and abetted Solons rebel mother in her
flight

Not if _I_ carry it said she snatching up the birdcage run inside
that den where they sell refreshments hell see ME and go somewhere
else

It fell out precisely as she planned They heard Solon demanding a lady
with a birdcage of the agent they heard the agents reply given with
official indifference There she is inside Directly Solon a small
man with an anxious mien ran into the waitingroom flung a glance of
disappointment at Tilly and ran out again

Tilly went to her client Did he look like he was anxious was the
mothers greeting Oh I just know he and Minnie will be hunting me
everywhere Maybe I had better go home stead of to Baxter

No you hadnt said Tilly with decision Mothers going to Baxter
too and if you like minnit youre safely off Ill go tell your
folks

Youre real kind Id be ever so much obliged And you dont mind your
ma travelling alone aint that nice for her She seemed much cheered
by the prospect of company and warmed into confidences

I am kinder lonesome sometimes thats a fact said she and I
kinder wish I lived in a block or a flat like your ma You see Minnie
teaches in the public school and shes away all day and she dont like
to have me make company of the hired girl though shes a real nice
girl And there aint nothing for me to do and I feel like I wasnt no
use any more in the world I remember thats what our old minister
in Ohio said once He was a real nice old man and they HAD thought
everything of him in the parish but he got old and his sermons were
long and so they got a young man for assistant and they made HIM a
_pastor americus_ they called itsome sort of Latin Folks did say
the young feller was stuck up and snubbed the old man anyhow he never
preached after young Lisbon come and only made the first prayers But
when the old folks would ask him to preach some of the old sermons
they had liked he only would say No friends I know more about my
sermons now He didnt live very long and I always kinder fancied
being a AMERICUS killed him And some days I git to feeling like I was a
kinder AMERICUS myself

That aint fair to your children said Tilly you ought to let them
know how you feel Then theyd act different

Oh I dont know I dont know You see miss theyre so sure they
know bettern me Say Mrs Louder be you going to visit relatives in
Baxter

No maam Im going to take care of a sick lady said Jane its
kinder queer Her names Ferguson her

For the lands sake screamed Mrs Higbee why thats my Liza She
was in a flutter of surprise and delight and so absorbed was Tilly in
getting her and her unwieldy luggage into the car that Janes daughter
forgot to kiss her mother goodby

Put your arm in QUICK she yelled as Jane essayed to kiss her hand
through the window dont EVER put your arm or your head out of a
trainthe train moved awayI do hope shell remember what I told
her and not lend anybody money or come home lugging somebody elses
baby

With such reflections and an ugly sensation of loneliness creeping over
her Tilly went to assure Miss Minnie Higbee of her mothers safety She
described her reception to Harry Lossing and Alma later She really
seemed kinder mad at me says Tilly seemed to think I was interfering
somehow And she hadnt any business to feel that way for SHE didnt
know how Id fooled her brother with that birdcage I guess the poor
old lady darent call her soul her own Id hate to have my mother that
wayso fraid of me MY mother shall go where she pleases and stay
where she pleases and DO as she pleases

That makes me think says Alma I heard you were going to move

Yes we are Mother is working too hard She knows everybody in the
building and they call on her all the time and I think the easiest way
out is just to move

Alma and Mr Lossing exchanged glances There is an Arabian legend of
an angel whose trade it is to decipher the language of faces This angel
must have perceived that Almas eyes said with the courage of a second
in a duel Go on now is the time and that Harrys answered with
masculine pusillanimity I dont like to

But he spoke Very likely your mother does sometimes work too hard
said he But dont you think it would be harder for her not to work
Why she must have been in the building ever since my father bought
it and shes been a janitor and a fire inspector and a doctor and a
ministering angel combined That is why we never raised the rent to you
when we improved the building and raised it on the others My father
told me your mother was the best paying tenant he ever had And dont
you remember how when I used to come with him when I was a little boy
she used to take me in her room while he went the rounds She was always
doing good to everybody the same way She has a heart as big as the
Mississippi and I assure you Miss Louder you wont make her happy
but miserable if you try to dam up its channel She has often told me
that she loved the building and all the people in it They all love her
I HOPE Miss Louder youll think of those things before you decide She
is so unselfish that she would go in a minute if she thought it would
make you happier The angel aforesaid during this speech which Harry
delivered with great energy and feeling must have had all his wits
busy on Tillys impassive features but he could read ardent approval
succeeded by indignation on Almas countenance at his first glance
The indignation came when Tilly spoke She said Thank you Mr
Lossing youre very kind Im sureHarry softly kicked the
wastebasket under the deskbut I guess its best for us to go Ive
been thinking about it for six months and I know it will be a hard
struggle for mother to go but in a little while she will be glad
she went Its only for her sake I am doing it it aint an easy or a
pleasant thing for me to do either As Tilly stopped her voice was
unsteady and the rare tears shone in her eyes

Whats best for her is the only question of course said Alma
helping Harry off the field

In a few days Tilly received a long letter from her mother Mr Ferguson
was doing wonders for the Russians the family were all very kind to her
and nice folks and easily pleased Of COURSE theyre pleased with
mothers cooking what would they be made of if they werent cried
Tilly It was wonderful how much help Mrs Higbee was about the house
and how happy it made her Mrs Ferguson had seemed real glad to see
her and that made her happy And then maybe it helped a little her
Jane Louders telling Mrs Ferguson accidental like how Tilly
treated her never trying to boss her and letting her travel alone
Perhaps if Mrs Ferguson kept on improving they might let her come
home next week And the letter ended


I will be so glad if they do for I want to see you so bad dear
daughter and I want to see the old home once more before we leave I
guess the house you tell me about will be very nice and convenient I
do thank you dear daughter for being so nice and considerate about the
Russians Give my love to Mrs Carleton and all of them and if little
Bobby Green hasnt missed school since I left give him a nickel
please and please give that medical student on the fifth floorI
forget his namethe stockings I mended They are in the first drawer of
the walnut bureau Goodby my dear good daughter

MOTHER JANE M LOUDER


When Tilly read the letter she was surrounded by wallpaper and carpet
samples Her eyes grew moist before she laid it down but she set her
mouth more firmly

It is an awful short time but Ive just got to hurry and have it over
before she comes said she

Next week Jane returned She was on the train waiting in her seat in
the car when Captain Ferguson handed her Tillys last letter which had
lain in the postoffice for three days

It was very short


DEAR MOTHER I shall be very glad indeed to see you I have a surprise
which I hope will be pleasant for you anyhow I truly have meant it for
your happiness

Your affectionate daughter

M E LOUDER


There must have been despite her shrewd sense an obtuse streak in
Tilly else she would never have written that letter Jane read it
twice The paper rattled in her hands Tilly has moved while I was
gone she said I never shall live in the block again She dropped
her veil over her face She sat very quietly in her seat but the
conductor who came for her ticket watched her sharply she seemed so
dazed by his demand and was so long in finding the ticket

The train rumbled and hissed through darkening cornfields into
scattered yellow lights of low houses into angles of white light of
streetarcs and shopwindows into the red and blue lights dancing
before the engines in the station

Mother cried Tillys voice

Jane let her and Harry Lossing take all her bundles and lift her out of
the car Whether she spoke a word she could not tell She did rouse a
little at the vision of the Lossing carriage glittering at the street
corner but she had not the sense to thank Harry Lossing who placed her
in the carriage and lifted his hat in farewell

Whats he doing all that for Tilly cried she there aintthere
aint nobody deadMaria Carleton She stared at Tilly wildly

Tilly was oddly moved though she tried to speak lightly No no there
aint nothing wrong at all Its because youve done so much for the
Russiansand other folks Now ma Im going to be mysterious You must
shut your eyes and shut your mouth until I tell you Thats a dear ma

It was vaguely comforting to have Tilly so affectionate Im a wicked
ungrateful woman to be so wretched thought Jane Ill never let Tilly
know how I felt

In a surprisingly short time the carriage stopped Now ma said
Tilly

A great blaze of light seemed all about Jane Louder There were the dear
familiar windows of the Lossing block

Come upstairs ma said Tilly

She followed like one in a dream and like one in a dream she was pushed
into her own old parlor The old parlor but not quite the old parlor
hung with new wallpaper shining with new paint soft under her feet
with a new carpet it looked to Jane Louder like fairyland

Oh Tilly she gasped oh Tilly aint you moved

No nor we aint going to move mathats the surprise I took the
money Id saved for moving for the new carpet and new dishes and the
Lossings they papered and painted I was SO fraid we couldnt get done
in time Alma and all the boarders are coming in pretty soon to
welcome you and theyve all chipped in for a little banquet at Mrs
Carletonswhy mother youre crying Mother you didnt really think
Id move when it made you feel so bad I know Im set and stubborn
and I didnt take it well when Mr Lossing talked to me but the more I
thought it over the more I seemed to myself like that hateful Minnie
Oh mother I aint am I You shall do just exactly as you like all the
days of your life




AN ASSISTED PROVIDENCE

IT was the Christmas turkeys that should be held responsible Every year
the Lossings give each head of a family in their employ and each
lad helping to support his mother a turkey at Christmastide As the
business has grown so has the number of turkeys until it is now
well up in the hundreds and requires a special contract Harry one
Christmas some two years ago bought the turkeys at so good a bargain
that he felt the natural reaction in an impulse to extravagance In
the very floodtide of the moneyspending yearnings he chanced to
pass Deacon Hursts stables and to see two Saint Bernard puppies of
elephantine size but of the tenderest age gambolling on the sidewalk
before the office Deacon Hurst I should explain is no more a deacon
than I am he is a liverystable keeper very honest a keen and solemn
sportsman and withal of a staid demeanor and a habitual garb of black
Now you know as well as I any reason for his nickname

Deacon Hurst is fond of the dog as well as of that noble animal the
horse he has three copies of Black Beauty in his stable which would
do an incalculable amount of good if they were ever read and he
usually has half a dozen dogs of his own with pedigrees long enough
for a poor gentlewoman in a New England village He told Harry that the
Saint Bernards were grandsons of Sir Bevidere the finest dog of his
time in the world sir that they were perfectly marked and very
large for their age which Harry found it easy to believe of the young
giants and that they were ridiculous sir at the figger of two
hundred and fifty which Harry did not believe so readily and after
Harry had admired and studied the dogs for the space of half an hour
he dropped the price in a kind of spasm of generosity to two hundred
dollars Harry was tempted to close the bargain on the spot hotheaded
but he decided to wait and prepare his mother for such a large addition
to the stable

The more he dwelt on the subject the more he longed to buy the dogs

In fact a time comes to every healthy man when he wants a dog just
as a time comes when he wants a wife and Harrys dog was dead
By consequence Harry was in the state of sensitive affection and
desolation to which a promising new object makes the most moving appeal
The departed dog Bruce by name had been a Saint Bernard and Deacon
Hurst found one of the puppies to have so much the expression of
countenance of the late Bruce that he named him Bruce on the spota
little before Harry joined the group Harry did not at first recognize
this resemblance but he grew to see it and combined with the dogs
affectionate disposition it softened his heart By the time he told his
mother he was come to quoting Hursts adjectives as his own

Beauties mother says Harry with sparkling eyes the markings are
perfectcouldnt be better and their heads are shaped just right
You cant get such watchdogs in the world And for all their enormous
strength gentle as a lamb to women and children And mother one of
them looks like Bruce

I suppose they would want to be housedogs says Mrs Lossing a little
dubiously but looking fondly at Harrys handsome face you know
somehow all our dogs no matter how properly they start in a kennel
end by being so hurt if we keep them there that they come into the
house And they are so large it is like having a pet lion about

These dogs mother shall never put a paw in the house

Well I hope just as I get fond of them they will not have the
distemper and die said Mrs Lossing which speech Harry rightly took
for the white flag of surrender

That evening he went to find Hurst and clinch the bargain As it
happened Hurst was away driving an especially important political
personage to an especially important political council The day
following was a Sunday but by this time Harry was so bent upon
obtaining the dogs that he had it in mind to go to Hursts house for
them in the afternoon When Harry wants anything from Saint Bernards to
purity in politics he wants it with an irresistible impetus If he
did wrong his error was linked to its own punishment But this is
anticipating if not presuming I prefer to leave Harry Lossings
experience to paint its own moral without pushing The event that
happened next was Harrys pulling out his checkbook and beginning to
write a check remarking with a slight drooping of his eyelids Best
catch the deacons generosity on the fly or it may make a home run

Then he let the pen fall on the blotter for he had remembered the
day After an instants hesitation he took a couple of hundreddollar
banknotes out of a drawer I think they were gifts for his two sisters
on Christmas day for he is a generous brother and most likely there
would be some small domestic joke about engravings to go with them
these he placed in the righthand pocket of his waistcoat In his
lefthand waistcoat pocket were two fivedollar notes

Harry was now arrayed for church He was a figure to please any womans
eye thought his mother as she walked beside him and gloried silently
in his six feet of health and muscle and dainty cleanliness He was in a
most amiable mood what with the Saint Bernards and the season As they
approached the cathedral close Harry not for the first time admired
the pure Gothic lines of the cathedral and the soft blending of grays
in the stone with the warmer hues of the brown network of Virginia
creeper that still fluttered a remnant of the crimson adornings of
autumn Beyond were the bare square outlines of the old college with
a wooden cupola perched on the roof like a little hat on a fat man
the dullred tints of the professors houses and the withered lawns and
bare trees The turrets and balconies and arched windows of the boys
school displayed a red background for a troop of gray uniforms and
blazing buttons the boys were forming to march to church Opposite the
boys school stood the modest square brick house that had served the
first bishop of the diocese during laborious years Now it was the
deans residence Facing it just as you approached the cathedral the
street curved into a halfcircle on either side and in the centre the
granite soldier on his shaft looked over the city that would honor him
Harry saw the tall figure of the dean come out of his gate the long
black skirts of his cassock fluttering under the wind of his big steps
Beside him skipped and ran to keep step with him a little man in
illfitting black of whose appearance thus viewed from the rear one
could only observe stooping shoulders and irongray hair that curled at
the ends

He must be the poor missionary who built his church himself Mrs
Lossing observed he is not much of a preacher the dean said but he
is a great worker and a good pastor

So much the better for his people and the worse for us says Harry
cheerfully

Why

Naturally We shall get the poor sermon and they will get the good
pastoring

Then Harry caught sight of a womans frock and a profile that he knew
and thought no more of the preacher whoever he might be

But he was in the chancel in plain view after the procession of
choirboys had taken their seats He was an elderly man with thin
cheeks and a large nose He had one of those great orotund voices that
occasionally roll out of little men and he read the service with a
misjudged effort to fill the building The building happened to have
peculiarly fine acoustic properties but the unfortunate man roared like
him of Bashan There was nothing of the customary ecclesiastical dignity
and monotony about his articulation indeed it grew plain and plainer
to Harry that he must have come over from some franker and more
emotional denomination It seemed quite out of keeping with his homely
manner and crumpled surplice that this particular reader should intone
Intone nevertheless he did and as badly as mortal man well could It
was not so much that his voice or his ear went wrong he would have had
a musical voice of the heavy sort had he not bellowed neither did his
ear betray him the trouble seemed to be that he could not decide when
to begin now he began too early and again with a startled air he
began too late as if he had forgotten

I hope he will not preach thought Harry who was absorbed in a rapt
contemplation of his sweethearts back hair He came back from a tender
revery by way of a little detour into the furniture business and the
establishment that a man of his income could afford to the church and
the preacher and his own sins to find the strange clergyman in the
pulpit plainly frightened and bawling more loudly than ever under the
influence of fear He preached a sermon of wearisome platitudes making
up for lack of thought by repetition and shouting himself red in the
face to express earnestness Fourthclass Methodist effort thought
the listener in the Lossing pew stroking his fair mustache with
Episcopal decorations That man used to be a Methodist minister and
he was brought into the fold by a highchurchman Poor fellow the
Methodist church polity has a place for such fellows as he but he is a
stray sheep with us He doesnt half catch on to the motions yet Ill
warrant he is proud of that sermon and his wife thinks it one of the
great efforts of the century Here Harry took a short rest from the
sermon to contemplate the amazing moral phenomenon how robust can be a
wifes faith in a commonplace husband

Now this man reflected Harry growing interested in his own fancies
this man never can have LIVED He doesnt know what it is to suffer he
has only vegetated Doubtless in a prosaic way he loves his wife
and children but can a fellow who talks like him have any delicate
sympathies or any romance about him He looks honest I think he is a
right good fellow and works like a soldier but to be so stupid as he
is ought to HURT

Harry felt a whimsical moving of sympathy towards the preacher He
wondered why he continually made gestures with the left arm never with
his right

It gives a onesided effect to his eloquence said he But he thought
that he understood when an unguarded movement revealed a rent which had
been a mended place in the surplice

Poor fellow said Harry He recalled how as a boy he had gone to a
fancydress ball in Continental smallclothes so small that he had been
strictly cautioned by his mother and sisters not to bow except with the
greatest care lest he rend his magnificence and reveal that it was too
tight to allow an inch of underclothing The stockings in particular
had been short and his sister had providently sewed them on to the
kneebreeches and to guard against accidents still further had pinned
as well as sewed the pins causing Harry much anguish

Poor fellow said Harry again I wonder is HE pinned somewhere I
feel like giving him a lift he is so prosy it isnt likely anyone else
will feel moved to help

Thus it came about that when the dean announced that the alms this day
would be given to the parish of our friend who had just addressed us
and the plate paused before the Lossing pew Harry slipped his hand into
his waistcoat pocket after those two fivedollar notes

I should explain that Harry being a naturally lefthanded boy who has
laboriously taught himself the use of his right hand it is a family
joke that he is like the inhabitants of Nineveh who could not
tell their right hand from their left But Harry himself has always
maintained that he can tell as well as the next man

Out drifted the flock of choirboys singing For thee oh dear dear
country and presently following them out drifted the congregation
among the crowd the girl that Harry loved not so quickly that he had
not time for a look and a smile just tinged with rose and because she
was so sweet so good so altogether adorable and because she had not
only smiled but blushed and unobserved he had touched the fur of her
jacket the young man walked on air

He did not remember the Saint Bernards until after the early Sunday
dinner and during the afterdinner cigar He was sitting in the
library before some blazing logs at peace with all the world To him
thus came his mother and announced that the dean and that man who
preached this morning you know were waiting in the other room

They seem excited said she and talk about your munificence What
HAVE you been doing

Appear to make a great deal of fuss over ten dollars said Harry
lightly as he sauntered out of the door

The dean greeted him with something almost like confusion in his
cordiality he introduced his companion as the Rev Mr Gilling

Mr Gilling could not feel easy until he had

Made sure about there being no mistake interrupted Mr Gilling
Ithe sum was so great

A ghastly suspicion shot like a feverflush over Harrys mind Could it
be possible There were the two other bills could he have given one of
them Given that howling dervish a hundred dollars The thought was too
awful

It was really not enough for you to trouble yourself he said I dare
say you are thanking the wrong man He felt he must say something

To his surprise the dean colored while the other clergyman answered in
all simplicity

No sir no sir I know very well The only other bill except
dollars on the plate the dean here gave and the warden remembers that
you put in two notesIhe grew quite paleI cant help thinking you
maybe intended to put in only ONE His voice broke he tried to control
it The sum is so VERY large quavered he

I have given him BOTH bills two hundred dollars thought Harry He
sat down He was accustomed to read mens faces and plainly as ever
he had read he could read the signs of distress and conflict on the
prosaic dull features before him

I INTENDED to put in two bills said he Gilling gave a little
gaspso little only a quick ear could have caught it but Harrys
ear is quick He twisted one leg around the other a further sign of
deliverance of mind

Well sir well Mr Lossing he remarked clearing his throat
I cannot express to you properly thethe appreciation I have of
youryour PRINCELY gift Harry changed a groan into a cough and tried
to smile I would like to ask you however HOW you would like it to
be divided There are a number of worthy causes the furnishing of the
church which is in charge of the Ladies Aid Society they are very
hard workers the ladies of our church And there is the Altar Guild
which has the keeping of the altar in order They are mostly young
girls and they used to wash my thingsI mean the vestments
blushingbut theythey were so young they were not careful and my
wife thought she had best wash thevestments herself but she
allowed them to laundry the otherah things There was the same
discursiveness in his talk as in his sermon Harry thought and the
same uneasy restlessness of manner Then we give tovarious causes
andand there is also my own salary

That is what it was intended for said Harry I hope the two hundred
dollars will be of some use to you and then indirectly it will help
your church

Harry surprised a queer glance from the deans brown eyes there was
both humor and a something else that was solemn enough in it The dean
had believed that there was a mistake

All of it To ME cried Gilling

All of it To YOU Harry replied dryly He was conscious of the
deans gaze upon him I had a sudden impulse said he and I gave it
that is all

The tears rose to the clergymans eyes he tried to wink them away then
he tried to brush them away with a quick rub of his fingers then he
sprang up and walked to the window his back to Harry Directly he was
facing the young man again and speaking

You must excuse me Mr Lossing since my sickness a little thing
upsets me

Mr Gilling had diphtheria last spring the dean struck in there was
an epidemic of diphtheria in Matins Junction Mr Gilling really saved
the place but his wife and he both contracted the disease and his wife
nearly died

Harry remembered some story that he had heard at the timehis eyes
began to light up as they do when he is moved

Why YOU are the man that made them disinfect their houses cried he
and invented a little oven or something to steam mattresses and things
You are the man that nursed them and buried them when the undertaker
died You digged graves with your own handsI say I should like to
shake hands with you

Gilling shook hands submissively but looking bewildered

He cleared his throat Would you mind Mr Lossing if I took up your
time so far as to tell you what so overcame me

I should be glad

You see sir my wife was the daughter of the Episcopal ministerI
mean the rector at the townwell it wasnt a town it was two or
three towns off in Shelby County where I had my circuit You may be
surprised sir to know that I was once a Methodist minister

Is it possible said Harry

Yes sir Her fathermy wifes I meanwas about as high a churchman
as he could be and be married He induced me to join our communion and
very soon after I was married I hope Mr Lossing youll come and see
us some time and see my wife Sheare you married

I am not so fortunate

A good wife cometh from the Lord sir SURE I thought I appreciated
mine but I guess I didnt She had two things she wanted and one I
did want myself but the otherI couldnt seem to bring my mind to it
noanyhow We hadnt any children but one that died four years ago
a little baby Ever since she died my wife has had a longing to have
a stainedglass window with the picture you know of Christ blessing
little children put into our little church In Memoriam you know
Seems as if now weve lost the baby we think all the more of the
church Maybe she was a sort of idol to us Yes sir thats one thing
my wife fairly longed for Weve saved our money what we COULD save
there are so many calls during the sickness last winter the sick
needed so many things and it didnt seem right for us to neglect them
just for our babys window andthe money went The other thing was
different My wife has got it into her head I have a fine voice And
shes higher church than I am so she has always wanted me to INTONE I
told her Id look like a fool intoning and theres no mistake about
it I DO But she couldnt see it that way It was most the only point
wherein we differed and last spring when she was so sick and I didnt
know but Id lose her it was dreadful to me to think how Id
crossed her So Mr Lossing when she got well I promised her for a
thankoffering Id intone And I have ever since My people know me so
well and weve been through so much together that they didnt make any
fussthough they are not highfact is Im not high myself But they
were kind and considerate and I got on pretty well at home but when
I came to rise up in that great edifice before that cultured and
intellectual audience so finely dressed it did seem to me I could NOT
do it I was sorely tempted to break my promise I was for a fact He
drew a long breath I just had to pray for grace or I never would have
pulled through I had the sermon my wife likes best with me but I know
it lacksit lacksit isnt what you need I was dreadfully scared and
I felt miserable when I got up to preach itand then to think that you
werebut it is the Lords doing and marvellous in our eyes I dont
know what Maggie will say when I tell her we can get the window The
best she hoped was Id bring back enough so the church could pay me
eighteen dollars they owe on my salary And nowits wonderful Why
Mr Lossing Ive been thinking so much and wanting so to get that
window for her that hearing the dean wanted some carpentering done I
thought maybe as Im a fair carpenterthat was my trade once sirId
ask him to let ME do the job I was aware there is nothing in our
rulesI mean our canonsto prevent me and nobody need know I was the
rector of Matins Junction because I would come just in my overalls
There is a cheap place where I could lodge and I could feed myself for
almost nothing living is so cheap I was praying about that too
Now your noble generosity will enable me to donate what they owe on my
salary and get the window too

Take my advice said Harry donate nothing Say nothing about this
gift I will take care of the warden and I can answer for the dean

Yes said the dean on the whole Gilling you would better say
nothing I think Mr Lossing is more afraid of a reputation for
generosity than of the smallpox

The older man looked at Harry with glistening eyes of admiration with
what Christian virtues of humility he was endowing that embarrassed
young man it is painful to imagine

The deans eyes twinkled above his handkerchief which hid his mouth as
he rose to make his farewells He shook hands warmly God bless you
Harry said he Gilling too wrung Harrys hands he was seeking some
parting word of gratitude but he could only choke out I hope you will
get MARRIED some time Mr Lossing then youll understand

Well said Harry as the door closed and he flung out his arms and
his chest in a huge sigh I do believe it was better than the puppies




HARRY LOSSING

THE notebook of Mr Horatio Armorer president of our street railways
contained a page of interest to some people in our town on the occasion
of his last visit

He wrote it while the train creaked over the river and the porter of
his Pullman car was brushing all the dust that had been distributed on
the passengers clothing into the main aisle

If you had seen him writing it with a stubby little pencil that he
occasionally brightened with the tip of his tongue you would not have
dreamed him to be more profoundly disturbed than he had been in years
Nor would the page itself have much enlightened you

 _See abt road M D See L
 See E  M teaset
 See abt L_


Translated into longhand this reads See about the streetcar road
Marston the superintendent and Dane the lawyer See Lossing see
Esther and Maggie and remember about teaset See about Lossing

His memoranda written he slipped the book in his pocket reflecting
cynically Theres habit Ive no need of writing that Its not
pleasant enough to forget

Thirty odd years ago Horatio Armorerthey called him Raish thenhad
left the town to seek his fortune in Chicago It was his daydream to
wrestle a hundred thousand dollars out of the worlds tight fists and
return to live in pomp on Brady Street hill He should drive a buggy
with two horses and his wife should keep two girls Long ago the
hundred thousand limit had been reached and passed next the million
and still he did not return His father the Presbyterian minister left
his parish or to be exact was gently propelled out of his parish by
the disaffected the family had a new home and the son struggling to
help them out of his scanty resources went to the new parish and not
to the old He grew rich he established his brothers and sisters in
prosperity he erected costly monuments and a memorial church to his
parents they were beyond any other gifts from him he married and
lavished his money on three daughters but the home of his youth neither
saw him nor his money until Margaret Ellis bought a house on Brady
Street far up town where she could have all the grass that she wanted
Mrs Ellis was a widow and rich Not a millionaire like her brother but
the possessor of a handsome property

She was the bestnatured woman in the world and never guessed how hard
her neighbors found it to forgive her for always calling their town of
thirty thousand souls the country She said that she had pined for
years to live in the country and have horses and a Jersey cow and
chickens and a neat pig All of which modest cravings she gratified
on her little estate and the gardener was often seen with a scowl and
the garden hose keeping the pig neat

It was later that Mr Armorer had bought the street railways they
having had a troublous history and being for sale cheap Nobody that
knows Armorer as a business man would back his sentiment by so much
as an old shoe yet it was sentiment and not a good bargain that had
enticed the financier Once engaged the instincts of a shrewd trader
prompted him to turn it into a good bargain anyhow His fancy was
pleased by a vision of a return to the home of his childhood and his
struggling youth as a greater personage than his hopes had ever dared
promise

But in the event there was little enough gratification for his vanity
Not since his wifes death had he been so harassed and anxious for he
came not in order to view his new property but because his sister
had written him her suspicions that Harry Lossing wanted to marry his
youngest daughter

Armorer arrived in the early dawn Early as it was a handsome victoria
with horses sleeker of skin and harness heavier and brighter than one
is used to meet outside the great cities had been in waiting for twenty
minutes while for that space of time a pretty girl had paced up and
down the platform The keenest observer among the crowd airing its meek
impatience on the platform did not detect any sign of anxiety in her
behavior She walked erect with a step that left a cleancut footprint
in the dust as girls are trained to walk nowadays Her tailormade
gown of fine blue serge had not a wrinkle It was so simple that only
a fashionable woman could guess anywhere near the awful sum total which
that plain skirt that short jacket and that severe waistcoat had once
made on a ruled sheet of paper When she turned her face toward the low
red stationhouse and the people it looked gentle and the least in the
world sad She had one of those clear olive skins that easily grow pale
it was pale today Her black hair was fine as spun silk the coil under
her hatbrim shone as she moved The fine hair the soft transparent
skin and the beautiful marking of her brows were responsible for an air
of fragile daintiness in her person just as her almondshaped
liquid dark eyes and unsmiling mouth made her look sad It was a most
attractive face in all its moods sometimes it was a beautiful face
yet it did not have a single perfect feature except the mouth whichat
least so Harry Lossing told his mothermight have been stolen from the
Venus of Milo Even the mouth some critics called too small for her
nose but it is as easy to call her nose too large for her mouth

The instant she turned her back on the bustle of the station all the
lines in her face seemed to waver and the eyes to brighten Finally
when the train rolled up to the platform and a younglooking elderly man
swung himself nimbly off the steps the color flared up in her cheeks
only to sink as suddenly like a candle flame in a gust of wind

Mr Armorer put his two arms and his umbrella and travellingbag about
the charming shape in blue at the same time exclaiming Youre a good
girl to come out so early Essie Hows Aunt Meg

Oh very well She would have come too but she hasnt come back from
training

Training

Yes dear she has a regular trainer like John L Sullivan you know
She drives out to the park with Eliza and me and walks and runs races
and does gymnastics She has lost ten pounds

Armorer wagged his head with a grin I dare say I thought so when you
began Meg is always moaning and groaning because she isnt a sylph
She will make her cooks life a burden for about two months and lose ten
pounds and then she will revel in icecream Last time she was raving
about Dr Salisbury and living on beefsteak sausages spending a fortune
starving herself

She had Dr Salisburys pamphlet but Cardigan told her it was a long
way out so she said she hated to have it do no one any good and she
gave it to Maria one of the maids who is always fretting because she
is so thin

But the thing was to cure fat people

Precisely Esther laughed a little low laugh at which her fathers
eyes shone but you see she told Maria to exactly reverse the advice
and eat everything that was injurious to stout people and it would be
just right for her

I perceive said Armorer dryly very ingenious and feminine scheme
But who is Cardigan

Shuey Cardigan He is the trainer He is a fireman in a furniture shop
now but he used to be the boxing teacher for some Harvard men and he
was a distinguished pugilist once He said to me modestly I dont
suppose you will have seen my name in the _Police Gazette_ miss But
he really is a very sober decent man notwithstanding

Your Aunt Meg always was picking up queer birds Pray who introduced
this decent pugilist

Esther was getting into the carriage her face was turned from him but
he could see the pink deepen in her ear and the oval of her cheek She
answered that it was a friend of theirs Mr Lossing As if the name had
struck them both dumb neither spoke for a few moments Armorer bit a
sigh in two Essie said he I guess it is no use to sidetrack the
subject You know why I came here dont you

Aunt Meg told me what she wrote to you

I knew she would She had compunctions of conscience letting him hang
round you until she told me and then she had awful gripes because she
had told and had to confess to YOU

He continued in a different tone Essie I have missed your mother
a long while and nobody knows how that kind of missing hurts but it
seems to me I never missed her as I do today I need her to advise me
about you Essie It is like this I dont want to be a stern parent
any more than you want to elope on a rope ladder We have got to look
at this thing together my dear little girl and try toto trust each
other

Dont you think papa said Esther smiling rather tremulously that
we would better wait before we have all these solemn preparations
until we know surely whether Mr Lossing wants me

Dont you know surely

He has never said anything ofof thatkind

Oh he is in love with you fast enough growled Armorer but a smile
of intense relief brightened his face Now you see my dear all I
know about this young man except that he wants my daughterwhich you
will admit is not likely to prejudice me in his favoris that he is
mayor of this town and has a furniture store

A manufactory it is a very large business

All right manufactory then all the same he is not a brilliant match
for my daughter not such a husband as your sisters have Esthers lip
quivered and her color rose again but she did not speak Still I will
say that I think a fellow who can make his own fortune is better than
a man with twice that fortune made for him My dear if Lossing has the
right stuff in him and he is a real good fellow I shant make you go
into a decline by objecting but you see it is a big shock to me and
you must let me get used to it and let me size the young man up in my
own way There is another thing Esther I am going to Europe Thursday
that will give me just a day in Chicago if I go tomorrow and I wish
you would come with me Will you mind

Either she changed her seat or she started at the proposal But how
could she say that she wanted to stay in America with a man who had not
said a formal word of love to her I can get ready I think papa
said Esther

They drove on He felt a crawling pain in his heart for he loved his
daughter Esther as he had loved no other child of his and he knew that
he had hurt her Naturally he grew the more angry at the impertinent
young man who was the cause of the flitting for the whole European plan
had been cooked up since the receipt of Mrs Elliss letter They were
on the very street down which he used to walk for it takes the line of
the hills when he was a poor boy a struggling ferociously ambitious
young man He looked at the changed rows of buildings and other
thoughts came uppermost for a moment It was here fathers church used
to stand its gone now he said It was a wood church painted a
kind of gray mother had a bonnet the same color and she used to say
she matched the church I bought it with the very first money I earned
Part of it came from weeding and the weather was warm and I can feel
the way my back would sting and creak now I would want to stop often
but I thought of mother in church with that bonnet and I kept on
Theres the place where Seeds the grocer that used to trust us had
his store it was his children had the scarlet fever and mother went
to nurse them My but how dismal it was at home We always got more
whippings when mother was away Your grandfather was a good man too
honest for this world and he loved every one of his seven children
but he brought us up to fear him and the Lord We feared him the most
because the Lord couldnt whip us He never whipped us when we did
anything but waited until next day that he might not punish in anger
so we had all the night to anticipate it Did I ever tell you of the
time he caught me in a lie I was lame for a week after it He never
caught me in another lie

I think he was cruel I cant help it papa cried Esther with whom
this was an old argument still it did good that time

Oh no he wasnt cruel my dear said Armorer with a queer smile
that seemed to take only onehalf of his face not answering the last
words he was too sure of his interpretation of the Scripture that was
all Why that man just slaved to educate us children hed have gone
to the stake rejoicing to have made sure that we should be saved And of
the whole seven only one is a church member Is that the road

They could see a car swinging past on a parallel street its bent pole
hitching along the trolleywire


Pretty scrubbylooking cars commented Armorer but get our new
ordinance through the council we can save enough to afford some fine
new cars Has Lossing said anything to you about the ordinance and our
petition to be allowed to leave off the conductors

He hasnt said anything but I read about it in the papers Is it so
very important that it should be passed

Saving money is always important my dear said Armorer seriously

The horses turned again They were now opposite a fair lawn and a
house of wood and stone built after the old colonial pattern as modern
architects see it Esther pointed saying

Aunt Megs papa isnt it pretty

Very handsome very fine said the financier who knew nothing about
architecture except its exceeding expense Esther Ive a notion if
that young man of yours has brains and is fond of you he ought to be
able to get my ordinance through his little eight by ten city council
There is our chance to see what stuff he is made of

Oh he has a great deal of influence said Esther he can do it
unlessunless he thinks the ordinance would be bad for the city you
know

Confound the modern way of educating girls thought Armorer Now it
would have been enough for Esthers mother to know that anything was for
my interests it wouldnt have to help all outdoors too

But instead of enlarging on this point he went into a sketch of the
improvements the road could make with the money saved by the change
and was waxing eloquent when a lady of a pleasant and comely face and a
trig though not slender figure advanced to greet them


It was after breakfast and the scene was the neat pigs pen where
Armorer was displaying his ignorance of swine that he found his first
chance to talk with his sister alone Oh first Sis said he about
your birthday today I telegraphed to Tiffanys for that silver
service you know that you liked so you neednt think theres a
mistake when it comes

Oh Raish that gorgeous thing I must kiss you if Daniel does see
me

Oh thats all right said Armorer hastily and began to talk of
the pig Suddenly without looking up he dropped into the pigpen the
remark Im very much obliged to you for writing me Meg

I dont know whether to feel more like a virtuous sister or a villanous
aunt sighed Mrs Ellis things seemed to be getting on so rapidly
that it didnt seem right Esther visiting me and all not to give you a
hint still I am sure that nothing has been said and it is horrid for
Esther perfectly HORRID discussing her proposals that havent been
proposed

I dont want them ever to be proposed said Armorer gloomily

I know you always said you didnt want Esther to marry but I thought
if she fell in love with the right manwe know that marriage is a very
happy estate sometimes Horatio She sighed again In her case it
was only the memory of happiness for Colonel Ellis had been dead these
twelve years but his widow mourned him still

If you marry the right one maybe answered Armorer grudgingly
but see here Meg Esther is different from the other girls they got
married when Jenny was alive to look after them and I knew the men and
they were both big matches you know Then too I was so busy making
money while the other girls grew up that I hadnt time to get real well
acquainted with them I dont think they ever kissed me except when I
gave them a check But Esther and I he drummed with his fingers on
the boards his thin keen face wearing a look that would have amazed
his business acquaintancesyou remember when her mother died Meg
Only fifteen and how she took hold of things And we have been together
ever since and she makes me think of her grandmother and her mother
both Shes never had a wish I knew that I havent grantedwhy d
it Ive bought my clothes to please her

Thats why you are become so welldressed Horatio I wondered how you
came to spruce up so interrupted Mrs Ellis

It has been so blamed lonesome whenever she went to visit you but yet
I wouldnt say a word because I knew what a good time she had but if I
had known that there was a confounded longlegged sniffy young idiot
all that while trying to steal my daughter away from me In an access
of wrath at the idea Armorer wrenched off the picket that he clutched
at which he laughed and stuck his hands in his pockets

Why Meg the papers and magazines are always howling that women wont
marry cried he with a fresh sense of grievance now two of my girls
have married thats enough there was no reason for me to expect any
more of them would There isnt one d bit of need for Esther to
marry

But if she loves the young fellow and he loves her wont you let them
be happy

He wont make her happy

He is a very good fellow truly and really Raish And he comes of a
good family

I dont care for his family and as to his being moral and all that I
know several young fellows that could skin him alive in a bargain
that are moral as you please I have been a moral man myself But the
trouble with this Lossing I told Esther I didnt know anything about
him but I do the trouble with him is that he is chock full of all
kinds of principles Just as father was Dont you remember how he lost
parish after parish because he couldnt smooth over the big men in them
Lossing is every bit as pigheaded I am not going to have my daughter
lead the kind of life my mother did I want a soninlaw who aint going
to think himself so much better than I am and be rowing me for my way
of doing business If Esther MUST marry Id like her to marry a man with
a head on him that I can take into business and who will be willing to
live with the old man This Lossing has got his notions of making a sort
of Highland chief affair of the labor question and we should get along
about as well as the Kilkenny cats

Mrs Ellis knew more than Esther about Armorers business methods
having the advantage of her husbands point of view and Colonel Ellis
had kept the army standard of honor as well as the army ignorance of
business To counterbalance she knew more than anyone alive what a good
son and brother Horatio had always been But she could not restrain a
smile at the picture of the partnership

Precisely you see yourself said Armorer Meghesitatingyou
dont suppose it would be any use to offer Esther a cool hundred
thousand to promise to bounce this young fellow

Horatio NO cried Mrs Ellis tossing her pretty gray head
indignantly youd insult her

Take it the same way eh Well perhaps Essie has hightoned notions
Thats all right it is the thing for women Mother had them too Look
here Meg Ill tell you I want to see if this young fellow has ANY
sense We have an ordinance that we want passed If he will get his
council to pass it that will show he can put his grand theories into
his pockets sometimes and I will give him a show with Esther If he
doesnt care enough for my girl to oblige her father even if he doesnt
please a lot of carping roosters that want the earth for their town and
would like a street railway to be run to accommodate them and lose money
for the stockholders well then you cant blame me if I dont want
him Now will you do one thing for me Meg to help me out I dont
want Lossing to persuade Esther to commit herself you know how when
she was a little mite if Esther gave her word she kept it I want
you to promise me you wont let Esther be alone one second with young
Lossing She is going tomorrow but theres your whistparty tonight
I suppose hes coming And I want you to promise you wont let him have
our address If he treats me square he wont need to ask you for it
Well

He buttoned up his coat and folded his arms waiting

Mrs Elliss sympathy had gone out to the young people as naturally as
water runs down hill for she is of a romantic temperament though she
doesnt dare to be weighed But she remembered the silver service the
coffeepot the teapot the tray for spoons the creamer the hotwater
kettle the sugarbowl all on a rich salver splendid dazzling what
rank ingratitude it would be to oppose her generous brother Rather
sadly she answered but she did answer Ill do that much for you
Raish but I feel were risking Esthers happiness and I can only keep
the letter of my promise

Thats all I ask my dear said Armorer taking out a little shabby
notebook from his breastpocket and scratching out a line The line
effaced read

_See E  M teaset_


The silver service was a good muzzle he thought He went away for
an interview with the corporation lawyer and the superintendent of the
road leaving Mrs Ellis in a distraction of conscience that made her
the wonder of her servants that morning during all the preparations for
the whistparty She might have felt more remorseful had she guessed
her brothers real plan He knew enough of Lossing to be assured that
he would not yield about the ordinance which he firmly believed to be
a dangerous one for the city He expected he counted on the mayors
refusing his proffers He hoped that Esther would feel the sympathy
which women give without question generally to the business plans of
those near and dear to them taking it for granted that the plans are
right because they will advantage those so near and dear That was the
beautiful and proper way that Jenny had always reasoned why should
Jennys daughter do otherwise When Harry Lossing should oppose
her father and refuse to please him and to win her mustnt any
highspirited woman feel hurt Certainly she must and he would take
care to whisk her off to Europe before the young man had a chance to
make his peace Yes sir says Armorer to his only confidant you
never were a domestic conspirator before Horatio but you have got it
down fine You would do for GaboriauGaboriaus novels being the only
fiction that ever Armorer read Nevertheless his conscience pricked
him almost as sharply as his sisters pricked her Consciences are queer
things like certain crustaceans they grow shells in spots and proof
against moral artillery in one part they may be soft as a babys cheek
in another Armorers conscience had two sides business and domestic
people abused him for a business buccaneer at the same time his private
life was pure and he was a most tender husband and father He had never
deceived Esther before in her life Once he had ridden all night in a
freightcar to keep a promise that he had made the child It hurt him to
be hoodwinking her now But he was too angry and too frightened to cry
back

The interview with the lawyer did not take any long time but he spent
two hours with the superintendent of the road who pronounced him a
little nice fellow with no airs about him Asked a power of questions
about Harry Lossing guess there is something in that story about
Lossing going to marry his daughter

Marston drove him to Lossings office and left him there

He was on the ground and Marston lifting the whip to touch the horse
when he asked Say before you gois there any danger in leaving off
the conductors

Marston was raised on mules and he could not overcome a vehement
distrust of electricity Well said he I guess you want the cold
facts The children are almighty thick down on Third Street and
children are always trying to see how near they can come to being
killed you know sir and then the old women like to come and stand on
the track and ask questions of the motorneer on the other track so that
the car coming down has a chance to catch em The two together keep the
conductors on the jump

Is that so said Armorer musingly well I guess youd better close
with that insurance man and get the papers made out before we run the
new way

If we ever do run muttered the superintendent to himself as he drove
away

Armorer ran his sharp eye over the buildings of the Lossing Art
Furniture Manufacturing Company from the ugly square brick box that was
the nucleusthe egg so to speakfrom which the great concern had been
hatched to the handsome new structures with their great arched windows
and red mortar Pretty property very pretty property thought
Armorer wonder if that story Marston tells is true The story was to
the effect that a few weeks before his last sickness the older Lossing
had taken his son to look at the buildings and said Harry this will
all be yours before long It is a comfort to me to think that every
workman I have is the better not the worse off for my owning it
theres no blood or dirt on my money and I leave it to you to keep it
clean and to take care of the men as well as the business

Now wasnt he a d fool said Armorer cheerfully taking out his
notebook to mark

_See abt road MD_


And he went in Harry greeted him with exceeding cordiality and a fine
blush Armorer explained that he had come to speak to him about the
proposed streetcar ordinances he Armorer always liked to deal with
principals and without formality now couldnt they come representing
the city and the company to some satisfactory compromise Thereupon
he plunged into the statistics of the earnings and expenses of the road
with the aid of his notebook and made the absolute necessity of
retrenchment plain Meanwhile as he talked he studied the attentive
listener before him and Harry on his part made quite as good use of
his eyes Armorer saw a tall athletic fair young man very carefully
almost foppishly dressed with bright steady blue eyes and a firm chin
but a smile under his mustache like a childs it was so sunny and so
quick Harry saw a neat little figure in a perfectly fitting gray
check travelling suit with a rose in the buttonhole of the coat lapel
Armorer wore no jewellery except a gold ring on the little finger of his
right hand from which he had taken the glove the better to write Harry
knew that it was his dead wifes weddingring and noticed it with
a little moving of the heart The face that he saw was pale but not
sickly delicate and keen A silky brown mustache shot with gray and
a Vandyke beard hid either the strength or the weakness of mouth and
chin He looked at Harry with almondshaped pensive dark eyes so like
the eyes that had shone on Harrys waking and sleeping dreams for months
that the young fellow felt his heart rise again Armorer ended by asking
Harry in his most winning manner to help him pull the ordinance out of
the fire It would be he said impressively a favor he should not
forget

And you must know Mr Armorer said Harry in a dismal tone at which
the president chuckled within that there is no man whose favor I would
do so much to win

Well heres your chance said Armorer

Harry swung round in his chair his clinched fists on his knee He was
frowning with eagerness and his eyes were like blue steel

See here Mr Armorer said he I am frank with you I want to please
you because I want to ask you to let me marry your daughter But I
CANT please you because I am mayor of this town and I dont dare to
let you dismiss the conductors I dont DARE thats the point We have
had four children killed on this road since electricity was put in

We have had forty killed on one street railway I know what of it Do
you want to give up electricity because it kills children

No but look here the conductors lessen the risk A lady I know
only yesterday had a little boy going from the kindergarten home nice
little fellow only five years old

She ought to have sent a nurse with a child five years old a baby
cried Armorer warmly

That lady answered Harry quietly goes without any servant at all
in order to keep her two children at the kindergarten and the boys
elder sister was ill at home The boy got on the car and when he got
off at the crossing above his house he started to run across the other
traincar was coming the little fellow didnt notice and ran to cross
he stumbled and fell right in the path of the coming car

Where was the conductor He didnt seem much good

They had left off the conductor on that line

Well did they run over the boy Why havent I been informed of the
accident

There was no accident A man on the front platform saw the boy fall
made a flying leap off the moving car fell but scrambled up and pulled
the boy off the track It was sickening I thought we were both gone

Oh you were the man

I was the man and dont you see Mr Armorer why I feel strongly on
the subject If the conductor had been on there wouldnt have been any
occasion for any accident

Well sir you may be assured that we will take precautions against
any such accidents It is more for our interest than anyones to guard
against them And I have explained to you the necessity of cutting down
our expense list

That is just it you think you have to risk our lives to cut down
expenses but we get all the risk and none of the benefits I cant see
my way clear to helping you sir I wish I could

Then there is nothing more to say Mr Lossing said Armorer coldly
Im sorry a mere sentiment that has no real foundation should stand in
the way of our arranging a deal that would be for the advantage of both
the city and our road He rose

Harry rose also but lifted his hand to arrest the financier Pardon
me there is something else I wouldnt mention it but I hear you
are going to leave tomorrow and go abroad withMiss Armorer I am
conscious I havent introduced myself very favorably by refusing you a
favor when I want to ask the greatest one possible but I hope sir you
will not think the less of a man because he is not willing to sacrifice
the interests of the people who trust him to please ANYONE II hope
you will not object to my asking Miss Armorer to marry me concluded
Harry very hot and shaky and forgetting the beginning of his sentences
before he came to the end

Does my daughter love you do I understand Mr Lossing

I dont know sir I wish I did

Well Mr Lossing said Armorer wishing that something in the young
mans confusion would not remind him of the awful moment when he asked
old Forrester for his Jenny I am afraid I can do nothing for you If
you have too nice a conscience to oblige me I am afraid it will be too
nice to let you get on in the world Goodmorning

Stop a minute said Harry if it is only my ability to get on in the
world that is the trouble I think

It is your love for my daughter said Armorer if you dont love her
enough to give up a sentimental notion for her to win her I dont see
but you must lose her I bid you goodmorning sir

Not quite yet sirHarry jumped before the door you give me the
alternative of being what I call dishonorable or losing the woman I
love He pronounced the last word with a little effort and his lips
closed sharply as his teeth shut under them Well I decline the
alternative I shall try to do my duty and get the wife I want BOTH

Well you give me fair warning dont you said Armorer

Harry held out his hand saying I am sorry that I detained you I
didnt mean to be rude There was something boyish and simple about the
action and the tone and Armorer laughed As Harry attended him through
the outer office to the door he complimented the shops

Miss Armorer and Mrs Ellis have promised to give me the pleasure of
showing them to them this afternoon said Harry cant I show them and
part of our city to you also It has changed a good deal since you left
it

The remark threw Armorer off his balance for a rejected suitor this
young man certainly kept an even mind But he had all the helplessness
of the average American with regard to his daughters amusements The
humor in the situation took him and it cannot be denied that he began
to have a vivid curiosity about Harry In less time than it takes to
read it his mind had swung round the circle of these various points of
view and he had blandly accepted Harrys invitation But he mopped a
warm and furrowed brow outside and drew a prodigious sigh as he opened
the notebook in his hand and crossed out _See L_ That young fellow
aint all conscience said he not by a long shot

He found Mrs Ellis very apologetic about the Lossing engagement It was
made through the telephone Esther had been anxious to have her father
meet Lossing Lossing was to drive them there and later show Mr
Armorer the town

Mr Lossing is a very clever young man very said Armorer gravely
as he went out to smoke his cigar after luncheon He wished he had
stayed however when he returned to find that a visitor had called and
that this visitor was the mother of the little boy that Harry Lossing
had saved from the car The two women gave him the accident in full and
were lavish of harrowing detail including the mothers feelings So
you see Raish urged Mrs Ellis timidly there is some reason for
opposition to the ordinance

Esthers cheeks were red and her eyes shone but she had not spoken Her
father put his arm around her waist and kissed her hair And what did
you say Essie he asked gently to all the criticisms

I told her I thought you would find some way to protect the children
even if the conductors were taken off you didnt enjoy the slaughter of
children any more than anyone else

I guess we can fix it Here is your young man

Harry drove a pair of spirited horses He drove well and looked both
handsome and happy

Did you know that ladythe mother of the boy that wasnt run overwas
coming to see my sister said Armorer on the way

I did said Harry I sent her I thought she could explain the reason
why I shall have to oppose the bill better than I

Armorer made no reply

At the shops he kept his eye on the young man Harry seemed to know
most of his workmen and had a nod or a word for all the older men He
stopped several moments to talk with one old German who complained of
everything but looked after Harry with a smile nodding his head That
man Lieders is our best workman you cant get any better work in the
country said he I want you to see an armoire that he has carved it
is up in our exhibition room

Armorer said You seem to get on very well with your working people
Mr Lossing

I think we generally get on well with them and they do well
themselves in these Western towns For one thing we havent much
organization to fight and for another thing the individual workman has
a better chance to rise That man Lieders whom you saw is worth a good
many thousand dollars my father invested his savings for him

You are one of the philanthropists arent you Mr Lossing who are
trying to elevate the laboring classes

Not a bit of it sir I shall never try to elevate the laboring
classes it is too big a contract But I try as hard as I know how to
have every man who has worked for Harry Lossing the better for it I
dont concern myself with any other laboring men

Just then a murmur of exclamations came from Mrs Ellis and Esther whom
the superintendent was piloting through the shops Oh no it is too
heavy oh dont do it Mr Cardigan Oh we can see it perfectly well
from here PLEASE dont you will break yourself somewhere Mrs Ellis
shrieked this but the shrieks turned to a murmur of admiration as a
huge carved sideboard came bobbing and wobbling like an intoxicated
piece of furniture in a haunted house toward the two gentlewomen
Immediately a short but powerfully built man whose red face beamed
above his dusty shoulders like a full moon with a mustache emerged and
waved his hand at the sideboard

I could tackle the two of them begging your pardon ladies

Thats Cardigan explained Harry Miss Armorer may have told you
about him Oh SHUEY

Cardigan approached and was presented He brought both his heels
together and bowed solemnly bending his head at the same time

Pleased to meet you sir said Shuey Then he assumed an attitude of
military attention

Take us up in the elevator will you Shuey said Harry Step in Mr
Armorer please we will go and see the reproductions of the antique we
have a room upstairs

Mr Armorer stepped in Shuey following and then before Harry could
enter it the elevator shot upward andstuck

Whats the matter cried Armorer

Shuey was tugging at the wire rope He called in tones that seemed to
come from a panting chest Take a pull at it yourself sir Can you
move it

Armorer grasped the rope viciously Shuey was on the seat pulling from
above Were stuck sir fast

Cant you get down either

Divil a bit saving your presence sir Do ye think like the
waterworks could be busted

Cant you make somebody hear panted Armorer

Well you see theres a deal of noise of the machinery said Shuey
scratching his chin with a thoughtful air and they expect weve gone
up

Best try anyhow This infernal machine may take a notion to drop
said Armorer

And thats true too acquiesced Shuey Forthwith he did lift up his
voice in a loud wailing OHH Jimmy OHH Jimmy Ryan

Jimmy might have been in Chicago for any response he made though
Armorer shouted with Shuey and at every pause the whir of the machinery
mocked the shouters Indescribable moans and gurgles with a continuous
malignant hiss floated up to them from the rebel steam below as from
a volcano considering eruption Theyll be bound to need the elevator
some time if they dont need US and thats one comfort said Shuey
philosophically

Dont you think if we pulled on her we could get her up to the next
floor by degrees Now then

Armorer gave a dash and Shuey let out his muscles in a giant tug The
elevator responded by an astonishing leap that carried them past three
or four floors

Stop her stop her bawled Shuey but in spite of Armorers pulling
himself purple in the face the elevator did not stop until it bumped
with a crash against the joists of the roof

Well do you suppose were stuck HERE growled Armorer

Well sir Ill try Say dont be exerting yourself violent It
strikes me shes for all the world like the wimmenin exthremes sir
in exthremes And it wouldnt be noways so pleasant to go riproaring
that gait down cellar Slow and easy sir let me manage her Hi shes
working

In fact by slow degrees and much puffing Shuey got the erratic box to
the next floor where disregarding Shueys protestations that he could
make her mind Mr Armorer got out and they left the elevator to its
fate It was a long way through many rooms downstairs Shuey would
have beguiled the way by describing the rooms but Armorer was in a
raging hurry and urged his guide over the ground Once they were delayed
by a bundle of stuff in front of a door and after Shuey had laboriously
rolled the great roll away he made a misstep and tumbled over rolling
it back to a tittering accompaniment from the sewinggirls in the room
But he picked himself up in perfect good temper and kicked the roll ten
yards Girls is silly things said the philosopher Shuey but being
born that way it aint to be expected otherwise

He had the friendly freedom of his class in the West He praised Mrs
Elliss gymnastics and urged Armorer to stay over a morning train and
see a real pretty boxing match between Mr Lossing and himself

Oh he boxes too does he said Armorer

And why on earth would he groanlike wondered Shuey to himself He
does that sir he continued aloud didnt Mrs Ellis ever tell you
about the time at the circus She was there herself with three children
she borrowed and an unreasonable gyurl with a terrible big screech in
her and no sense Yes sir Mr Lossing he is mighty cliver with his
hands There come a yell of Lion loose lion loose at that circus
just as the folks was all crowding out at the end of it and them that
had gone into the menagerie tent came atumbling and howling back and
them that was in the circus tent waiting for the concert which never
aint worth waiting for between you and me was ascrambling off them
seats making a noise like thunder and all fighting and pushing and
bellowing to get out I was there with my wife and making for the seats
that the fools quit sos to get under and crawl out under the canvas
when I see Mrs Ellis holding two of the children and that fool
girl let the other go and I grabbed it Oh save the baby save one
anyhow cries my wifethe woman is a tinderhearted crechure And just
then I seen an old lady tumble over on the benches with her gray hair
stringing out of her black bonnet The crowd was WILD hitting and
screaming and not caring for anything and I see a big jack of a man
come plunging down right spang on that old lady His foot was right
in the air over her face Lord it turned me sick I yelled But that
minnit I seen an arm shoot out and that fellow shot off as slick it was
Mr Lossing He parted that crowd hitting right and left and he got
up to us and hauled a child from Mrs Ellis and put it on the seats
all the while shouting Keep your seats its all right its all over
stand back I turned and floored a feller that was too pressing and
hollered it was all right too And some more people hollered too You
see there is just a minnit at such times when it is a toss up whether
folks will quiet down and begin to laugh or get scared into wild beasts
and crush and kill each other And Mr Lossing he caught the minnit
The circus folks came up and the police and it was all over WELL just
look here sir theres our folks coming out of the elevator

They were just landing and Mrs Ellis wanted to know where he had gone

We run away from ye shure said Shuey grinning and he related the
adventure Armorer fell back with Mrs Ellis Did you stay with Esther
every minute said he Mrs Ellis nodded She opened her lips to
speak then closed them and walked ahead to Harry Lossing Armorer
lookedsuspicion of a dozen kinds gnawing him and insinuating that the
three all seemed agitatedfrom Harry to Esther and then to Shuey But
he kept his thoughts to himself and was very agreeable the remainder of
the afternoon

He heard Harry tell Mrs Ellis that the city council would meet that
evening before however Armorer could feel exultant he added but may
I come late

He is certainly the coolest beggar Armorer snarled but he is sharp
as a niggers razor confound him

Naturally this remark was a confidential one to himself

He thought it more times than one during the evening and by consequence
played trumps with equal disregard of the laws of the noble game of
whist and his partners feelings He found a few a very few elderly
people who remembered his parent and they will never believe ill of
Horatio Armorer who talked so simply and with so much feeling of
old times and who is going to give a memorial window in the new
Presbyterian church He was beginning to think with some interest of
supper the usual dinner of the family having been sacrificed to the
demands of state then he saw Harry Lossing The young mayors blond
head was bowing before his sisters black velvet He caught Armorers
eye and followed him out to the lawn and the shadows and the gay
lanterns He looked animated Evening dress was becoming to him One of
my daughters married a prince but I am hanged if he looked it like this
fellow thought Armorer but then he was only an Italian I suppose
the council did not pass the ordinance your committee reported against
it he said quite amicably to Harry

I wish you could understand how much pain it has given me to oppose
you Mr Armorer said Harry blushing

I dont doubt it under the circumstances Mr Lossing Armorer spoke
with suave politeness but there was a cynical gleam in his eye

But Esther understands says Harry

Esther repeats Armorer with an indescribable intonation You spoke
to her this afternoon For a man with such hightoned ideas as you
carry I think you took a pretty mean advantage of your guests

You will remember I gave you fair warning Mr Armorer

It was while I was in the elevator of course I guessed it was a
putup job how did you manage it

Harry smiled outright he is one who cannot keep either his dog or his
joke tied up It was Shuey did it said he he pulled the opposite
way from you and he has tremendous strength but he says you were a
handful for him

You seem to have taken the town into your confidence said Armorer
bitterly though he had a sneaking inclination to laugh himself do you
need all your workmen to help you court your girl

Id take the whole United States into my confidence rather than lose
her sir answered Harry steadily

Armorer turned on his heel abruptly it was to conceal a smile How
about my sister did you propose before her But I dont suppose a
little thing like that would stop you

I had to speak Miss Armorer goes away tomorrow Mrs Ellis was kind
enough to put her fingers in her ears and turn her back

And what did my daughter say

I asked her only to give me the chance to show her how I loved her and
she has God bless her I dont pretend Im worthy of her Mr Armorer
but I have lived a decent life and Ill try hard to live a better one
for her trust in me

Im glad there is one thing on which we are agreed jeered Armorer
but you are more modest than you were this noon I think it was
considerably like bragging sending that woman to tell of your heroic
feats

Oh I can brag when it is necessary said Harry serenely what would
the West be but for bragging

And what do you intend to do if I take your girl to Europe

Europe is not very far said Harry

Armorer was a quick thinker but he had never thought more quickly in
his life This young fellow had beaten him There was no doubt of it He
might have principles but he declined to let his principles hamper him
There was something about Harrys waving aside defeat so lightly and
so swiftly snatching at every chance to forward his will that accorded
with Armorers own temperament

Tell me Mr Armorer said Harry suddenly in my place wouldnt you
have done the same thing

Armorer no longer checked his sense of humor No Mr Lossing he
answered sedately I should have respected the old gentlemans wishes
and voted any way he pleased He held out his hand I guess Esther
thinks you are the coming young man of the century and to be honest
I like you a great deal better than I expected to this morning Im not
cut out for a cruel father Mr Lossing for one thing I havent the
time for it for another thing I cant bear to have my little girl cry
I guess I shall have to go to Europe without Esther Shall we go in to
the ladies now

Harry wrung the presidents hand crying that he should never regret his
kindness

See that Esther never regrets it that will be better said Armorer
with a touch of real and deep feeling Then as Harry sprang up the
steps like a boy he took out the notebook and smiling a smile in
which many emotions were blended he ran a black line through
