FROM SAND HILL TO PINE




A NIECE OF SNAPSHOT HARRYS


I

There was a slight jarring though the whole frame of the coach a
grinding and hissing from the brakes and then a sudden jolt as the
vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut polestraps of the now
arrested horses The murmur of a voice in the road was heard followed
by the impatient accents of Yuba Bill the driver

Whaat Speak up cant ye

Here the voice uttered something in a louder key but equally
unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers

One of them dropped the window nearest him and looked out He could see
the faint glistening of a rainwashed lantern near the wheelers heads
mingling with the stronger coach lights and the glow of a distant open
cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside The sound
of falling rain on the roof a soft swaying of windtossed trees and an
impatient movement on the boxseat were all they heard Then Yuba Bills
voice rose again apparently in answer to the other

Why thats half a mile away

Yes but ye might have dropped onto it in the dark and its all on the
down grade responded the strange voice more audibly

The passengers were now thoroughly aroused

Whats up Ned asked the one at the window of the nearest of two
figures that had descended from the box

Tree fallen across the road said Ned the expressman briefly

I dont see no tree responded the passenger leaning out of the
window towards the obscurity ahead

Now thats onfortnit said Yuba Bill grimly but ef any gentleman
will only lend him an opery glass mebbe he can see round the curve and
over the other side o the hill where it is Now then addressing the
stranger with the lantern bring along your axes cant ye

Heres one Bill said an officious outside passenger producing
the instrument he had taken from its strap in the boot It was the
regulation axe beautifully shaped highly polished and utterly
ineffective as Bill well knew

We aint cuttin no kindlins he said scornfully then he added
brusquely to the stranger Fetch out your biggest wood axeyouve got
one ye knowand look sharp

I dont think Bill need be so dd rough with the stranger
considering hes saved the coach a very bad smash suggested a
reflective young journalist in the next seat He talks as if the man
was responsible

He aint quite sure if that isnt the fact said the express
messenger in a lowered voice

Why What do you mean clamored the others excitedly

WellTHIS is about the spot where the up coach was robbed six months
ago returned the messenger

Dear me said the lady in the back seat rising with a half hysterical
laugh hadnt we better get out before they come

There is not the slightest danger madam said a quiet observant man
who had scarcely spoken before or the expressman would not have told
us nor would he I fancy have left his post beside the treasure on the
box

The slight sarcasm implied in this was enough to redden the expressmans
cheek in the light of the coach lamp which Yuba Bill had just unshipped
and brought to the window He would have made some tart rejoinder but
was prevented by Yuba Bill addressing the passengers Yell have to put
up with ONE light I reckon until weve got this job finished

How long will it last Bill asked the man nearest the window

Well said Bill with a contemptuous glance at the elegant coach axe
he was carrying in his hand considerin these purty firstclass highly
expensive hash choppers that the kempany furnishes us I reckon it may
take an hour

But is there no place where we can wait asked the lady anxiously I
see a light in that house yonder

Ye might try it though the kempany as a rule aint in the habit
o makin social calls there returned Bill with a certain grim
significance Then turning to some outside passengers he added Now
then them ez is goin to help me tackle that tree trot down I
reckon that blitherin idiot the stranger with the lantern who had
disappeared will have sense enough to fetch us some ropes with his
darned axe

The passengers thus addressed apparently miners and workingmen good
humoredly descended all except one who seemed disinclined to leave the
much coveted seat on the box beside the driver

Ill look after your places and keep my own he said with a laugh
as the others followed Bill through the dripping rain When they had
disappeared the young journalist turned to the lady

If you would really like to go to that house I will gladly accompany
you It was possible that in addition to his youthful chivalry there
was a little youthful resentment of Yuba Bills domineering prejudices
in his attitude However the quiet observant passenger lifted a look
of approval to him and added in his previous level half contemptuous
tone

Youll be quite as well there as here madam and there is certainly no
reason for your stopping in the coach when the driver chooses to leave
it

The passengers looked at each other The stranger spoke with authority
and Bill had certainly been a little arbitrary

Ill go too said the passenger by the window And youll come wont
you Ned he added to the express messenger The young man hesitated
he was recently appointed and as yet fresh to the businessbut he
was not to be taught his duty by an officious stranger He resented the
interference youthfully by doing the very thing he would have preferred
NOT to do and with assumed carelessnessyet feeling in his pocket to
assure himself that the key of the treasure compartment was safeturned
to follow them

Wont YOU come too said the journalist politely addressing the
cynical passenger

No I thank you Ill take charge of the coach was the smiling
rejoinder as he settled himself more comfortably in his seat

The little procession moved away in silence Oddly enough no one
except the lady really cared to go and twothe expressman and
journalistwould have preferred to remain on the coach But the
national instinct of questioning any purely arbitrary authority probably
was a sufficient impulse As they neared the opened door of what
appeared to be a fourroomed unpainted redwood boarded cabin the
passenger who had occupied the seat near the window said

Ill go first and sample the shanty

He was not however so far in advance of them but that the others could
hear quite distinctly his offhand introduction of their party on the
threshold and the somewhat lukewarm response of the inmates We
thought wed just drop in and be sociable until the coach was ready to
start again he continued as the other passengers entered This yer
gentleman is Ned Brice Adams  Cos expressman this yer is Frank
Frenshaw editor of the Mountain Banner this yers a lady so it
aint necessary to give HER name I reckoneven if we knowed it Mines
Sam Hexshill of Hexshill  Dobbss Flour Mills of Stockton whar
ef you ever come that way Ill be happy to return the compliment and
hospitality

The room they had entered had little of comfort and brightness in it
except the fire of pine logs which roared and crackled in the adobe
chimney The air would have been too warm but for the strong west wind
and rain which entered the open door freely There was no other light
than the fire and its tremulous and everchanging brilliancy gave a
spasmodic mobility to the faces of those turned towards it or threw
into stronger shadow the features that were turned away Yet by this
uncertain light they could see the figures of a man and two women The
man rose and with a certain apathetic gesture that seemed to partake
more of weariness and long suffering than positive discourtesy tendered
seats on chairs boxes and even logs to the selfinvited guests The
stage party were surprised to see that this man was the stranger who had
held the lantern in the road

Ah then you didnt go with Bill to help clear the road said the
expressman surprisedly

The man slowly drew up his tall shambling figure before the fire and
then facing them with his hands behind him as slowly lowered himself
again as if to bring his speech to the level of his hearers and give a
lazier and more deliberate effect to his longdrawn utterance

Wellno he said slowly
IdidntgowithnoBilltohelpclearthe road
IdontreckonTO gowithnoBilltoclearANY road Ive just
whittled this thing down to a pint and its thisI aint no stage
kempanys nigger So far as turnin out and warnin em agin goin to
smash over a fallen tree and slap down into the canyon with a passel of
innercent passengers Im that much a white man but I aint no NIGGER
to work clearing things away for em nor I aint no scrub to work
beside em He slowly straightened himself up again and with his
former apathetic air looking down upon one of the women who was setting
a coffeepot on the coals added But I reckon my old woman here kin
give you some coffee and whiskeyof you keer for it

Unfortunately the young expressman was more loyal to Bill than
diplomatic If Bills a little rough he said with a heightened
color perhaps he has some excuse for it You forget its only six
months ago that this coach was held up not a hundred yards from this
spot

The woman with the coffeepot here faced about stood up and either
from design or some odd coincidence fell into the same dogged attitude
that her husband had previously taken except that she rested her hands
on her hips She was prematurely aged like many of her class and her
black snakelike locks twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her
head showed threads of white against the firelight Then with slow and
implacable deliberation she said

We forget Well not much sonny We aint forgot it and we aint
goin to forget it neither We aint bin likely to forget it for
any time the last six months What with visitations from the county
constables snoopins round from Frisco detectives droppinsin from
newspaper men and yawpins and starins from tramps and strangers on
the roadwe havent had a chance to disremember MUCH And when at last
Hiram tackled the head stage agent at Marysville and allowed that this
yer pesterin and persecutin had got ter stopwhat did that yer head
agent tell him Told him to shet his head and be thankful that his
thievin old shanty wasnt burnt down around his ears Forget that six
months ago the coach was held up near here Not much sonnynot much

The situation was embarrassing to the guests as ordinary politeness
called for some expression of sympathy with their gloomy hostess and
yet a selfish instinct of humanity warned them that there must be some
foundation for this general distrust of the public The journalist was
troubled in his conscience the expressman took refuge in an official
reticence the lady coughed slightly and drew nearer to the fire with
a vague but safe compliment to its brightness and comfort It devolved
upon Mr Heckshill who felt the responsibility of his late airy
introduction of the party to boldly keep up his role with an equally
noncommittal lighthearted philosophy

Well maam he said addressing his hostess its a queer world
and no mans got sabe enough to say whats the rights and wrongs o
anything Some folks believe one thing and act upon it and other folks
think differently and act upon THAT The only thing ye kin safely say is
that THINGS IS EZ THEY BE My rule here and at the mill is jest to take
things ez I find em

It occurred to the journalist that Mr Heckshill had the reputation
in his earlier career of taking such things as unoccupied lands
and timber as he found them without much reference to their actual
owners Apparently he was acting upon the same principle now as he
reached for the demijohn of whiskey with the ingenuous pleasantry Did
somebody say whiskey or did I dream it

But this did not satisfy Frenshaw I suppose he said ignoring
Heckshills diplomatic philosophy that you may have been the victim
of some misunderstanding or some unfortunate coincidence Perhaps the
company may have confounded you with your neighbors who are believed
to be friendly to the gang or you may have made some injudicious
acquaintances Perhaps

He was stopped by a suppressed but not unmusical giggle which appeared
to come from the woman in the corner who had not yet spoken and whose
face and figure in the shadow he had previously overlooked But he could
now see that her outline was slim and graceful and the contour of her
head charmingfacts that had evidently not escaped the observation of
the expressman and Mr Heckshill and that might have accounted for
the cautious reticence of the one and the comfortable moralizing of the
other

The old woman cast an uneasy glance on the fair giggler but replied to
Frenshaw

Thats it injerdishus acquaintances But just because we might
happen to have friends or even be sorter related to folks in another
line o business that aint none o ours the kempany haint no call to
persecute US for it Spose we do happen to know some one like

Spit it out aunty now youve started in I dont mind said the
fair giggler now apparently casting off all restraint in an outburst of
laughter

Well said the old woman with dogged desperation suppose then
that that young girl thar is the niece of Snapshot Harry who stopped
the coach the last time

And aint ashamed of it either interrupted the young girl rising
and disclosing in the firelight an audacious but wonderfully pretty
face and supposing he IS my uncle that aint any cause for their
bedevilin my poor old cousins Hiram and Sophy thar For all the
indignation of her words her little white teeth flashed mischievously
in the dancing light as if she rather enjoyed the embarrassment of
her audience not excluding her own relatives Evidently cousin Sophy
thought so too

Its all very well for you to laugh Flo you limb she retorted
querulously yet with an admiring glance at the girl for ye know thar
aint a man dare touch ye even with a word but its mighty hard on me
and Hiram all the same

Never you mind Sophy dear said the girl placing her hand half
affectionately half humorously on the old womans shoulder mebbe
I wont always be a discredit and a bother to you Jest you hold
your hosses and wait until uncle Harry holds up the next Pioneer
Coachthe dancing devil in her eyes glanced as if accidentally on
the young expressmanand hell make a big enough pile to send me to
Europe and youll be quit o me

The embarrassment suspiciousness and uneasiness of the coach party
here found relief in a half hysteric explosion of laughter in which
even the dogged Hiram and Sophy joined It seemed as impossible to
withstand the girls invincible audacity as her beauty She was quick to
perceive her advantage and with a responsive laugh and a picturesque
gesture of invitation said

Now thats all settled yed better waltz in and have your whiskey and
coffee afore the stage starts Ye kin comfort yourselves that it aint
stolen or pizoned even if it is served up to ye by Snapshot Harrys
niece With another easy gesture she swung the demijohn over her arm
and offering a tin cup to each of the men filled them in turn

The ice thus broken or perhaps thus perilously skated over the
passengers were as profuse in their thanks and apologies as they had
been constrained and artificial before Heckshill and Frenshaw vied with
each other for a glance from the audacious Flo If their compliments
partook of an extravagance that was at times ironical the girl was
evidently not deceived by it but replied in kind Only the expressman
who seemed to have fallen under the spell of her audacious glances was
uneasy at the license of the others yet himself dumb towards her The
lady discreetly drew nearer to the fire the old woman and her coffee
Hiram subsided into his apathetic attitude by the fire

A shout from the road at last proclaimed the return of Yuba Bill and his
helpers It had the singular effect of startling the party into a vague
and uneasy consciousness of indiscretion as if it had been the voice
of the outer world of law and order and their manner again became
constrained The leavetaking was hurried and perfunctory the
diplomatic Heckshill again lapsed into glittering generalities about
the best of friends parting Only the expressman lingered for a moment
on the doorstep in the light of the fire and the girls dancing eyes

I hope he stammered with a very youthful blush to come the next
timewithwitha better introduction

Uncle Harrys she said with a quick laugh and a mock curtsey as she
turned away

Once out of hearing the party broke into hurried comment and criticism
of the scene they had just witnessed and particularly of the fair
actress who had played so important a part averring their emphatic
intention of wresting the facts from Yuba Bill at once and
crossexamining him closely but oddly enough reaching the coach and
that redoubted individual no one seemed to care to take the initiative
and they all scrambled hurriedly to their seats without a word How far
Yuba Bills irritability and imperious haste contributed to this or a
fear that he might in turn catechise them kept them silent no one
knew The cynically observant passenger was not there he and the sole
occupant of the boxseat they were told had joined the clearing party
some moments before and would be picked up by Yuba Bill later on

Five minutes after Bill had gathered up the reins they reached the
scene of obstruction The great pinetree which had fallen from the
steep bank above and stretched across the road had been partly lopped
of its branches divided in two lengths which were now rolled to either
side of the track leaving barely space for the coach to pass The
huge vehicle slowed up as Yuba Bill skillfully guided his six horses
through this narrow alley whose tassels of pine glistening with wet
brushed the panels and sides of the coach and effectually excluded any
view from its windows Seen from the coach top the horses appeared to
be cleaving their way through a dark shining olive sea that parted
before and closed behind them as they slowly passed The leaders were
just emerging from it and Bill was gathering up his slackened reins
when a peremptory voice called Halt At the same moment the coach
lights flashed upon a masked and motionless horseman in the road Bill
made an impulsive reach for his whip but in the same instant checked
himself reined in his horses with a suppressed oath and sat perfectly
rigid Not so the expressman who caught up his rifle but it was
arrested by Bills arm and his voice in his ear

Too latewere covereddont be a dd fool

The inside passengers still encompassed by obscurity knew only that
the stage had stopped The outsiders knew by experience that they
were covered by unseen guns in the wayside branches and scarcely moved

I didnt think it was the square thing to stop you Bill till youd
got through your work said a masterful but not unpleasant voice and
if youll just hand down the express box Ill pass you and the rest of
your load through free But as were both in a hurry youd better look
lively about it

Hand it down said Bill gruffly to the expressman

The expressman turned with a white check but blazing eyes to the
compartment below his seat He lingered apparently in some difficulty
with the lock of the compartment but finally brought out the box and
handed it to another armed and masked figure that appeared mysteriously
from the branches beside the wheels

Thank you said the voice you can slide on now

And thank you for nothing said Bill gathering up his reins Its
the first time any of your kind had to throw down a tree to hold me up

Youre lying Billthough you dont know it said the voice
cheerfully Far from throwing down a tree to stop you it was I sent
word along the road to warn you from crashing down upon it and sending
you and your load to hll before your time Drive on

The angry Bill waited for no second comment but laying his whip over
the backs of his team drove furiously forward So rapidly had the whole
scene passed that the inside passengers knew nothing of it and even
those on the top of the coach roused from their stupor and inglorious
inaction only to cling desperately to the terribly swaying coach as it
thundered down the grade and try to keep their equilibrium Yet
furious as was their speed Yuba Bill could not help noticing that the
expressman from time to time cast a hurried glance behind him Bill knew
that the young man had shown readiness and nerve in the attack although
both were hopeless yet he was so much concerned at his set white face
and compressed lips that when at the end of three miles unabated
speed they galloped up to the first station he seized the young man
by the arm and as the clamor of the news they had brought rose around
them dragged him past the wondering crowd caught a decanter from the
bar and opening the door of a side room pushed him into it and closed
the door behind them

Look yar Brice Stop it Quit it right thar he said emphatically
laying his large hand on the young fellows shoulder Be a man Youve
shown you are one green ez you are for you had the sand in yethe
clear grit tonight yet youd have been a dead man now if I hadnt
stopped ye Man you had no show from the beginning Youve done your
level best to save your treasure and Im your witness to the kempany
and proud of it too So shet your head andand pouring out a glass
of whiskey swaller that

But Brice waved him aside with burning eyes and dry lips

You dont know it all Bill he said with a half choked voice

All what

Swear that youll keep it a secret he said feverishly gripping
Bills arm in turn and Ill tell you

Go on

THE COACH WAS ROBBED BEFORE THAT

Wot yer say ejaculated Bill

The treasurea packet of greenbackshad been taken from the box
before the gang stopped us

The hll you say

Listen When you told me to hand down the box I had an ideaa dd
fool one perhapsof taking that package out and jumping from the coach
with it I knew they would fire at me only I might get away but if
they killed me Id have done only my duty and nobody else would have
got hurt But when I got to the box I found that the lock had been
forced and the money was gone I managed to snap the lock again before
I handed it down I thought they might discover it at once and chase us
but they didnt

And then thar war no greenbacks in the box that they took gasped
Bill with staring eyes

No

Bill raised his hand in the air as if in solemn adjuration and then
brought it down on his knee doubling up in a fit of uncontrollable but
perfectly noiseless laughter Oh Lord he gasped hol me afore I
bust right open Hush he went on with a jerk of his fingers towards
the next room not a word o this to any one Its too much to keep
I know its nearly killing me but we must swaller it ourselves Oh
Jerusalem the Golden Oh Brice Think o that face o Snapshot Harrys
ez he opened that treasure box afore his gang in the brush And he
allers so keen and so easy and so cock sure Created snakes Id go
through this every trip for one sight of him as he just riz up from that
box and cussed He again shook with inward convulsions till his face
grew purple and even the red came back to the younger mans cheek

But this dont bring the money back Bill said Brice gloomily

Yuba Bill swallowed the glass of whiskey at a gulp wiped his mouth and
eyes smothered a second explosion and then gravely confronted Brice

When do you think it was taken and how

It must have been taken when I left the coach on the road and went
over to that settlers cabin said Brice bitterly Yet I believed
everything was safe and I left two menboth passengersone inside and
one on the box that man who sat the other side of you

Jee whillikins ejaculated Bill with his hand to his forehead the
men I clean forgot to pick up in the road and now I reckon they never
intended to be picked up either

No doubt a part of the gang said Brice with increased bitterness I
see it all now

No said Bill decisively that aint Snapshot Harrys style hes a
clean fighter with no underhand tricks And I dont believe he threw
down that tree either Look yer sonny he added suddenly laying his
hand on Brices shoulder a hundred to one that that was the work of
a couple o dd sneaks or traitors in that gang who kem along as
passengers I never took any stock in that coyote who paid extra for his
boxseat

Brice knew that Bill never looked kindly on any passenger who by
bribing the ticket agent secured this favorite seat which Bill felt
was due to his personal friends and was in his own selection He only
returned gloomily

I dont see what difference it makes to us which robber got the money

Ye dont said Bill raising his head with a sudden twinkle in his
eyes Then ye dont know Snapshot Harry Do ye suppose hes goin to
sit down and twiddle his thumbs with that skin game played on him No
sir he continued with a thoughtful deliberation drawing his fingers
slowly through his long beard he spotted itand smelt out the whole
trick ez soon ez he opened that box and thats why he didnt foller us
Hell hunt those sneak thieves into hll but what hell get em and
he went on still more slowly by the livin hokey I reckon sonny
thats jest how yell get your chance to chip in

I dont understand said Brice impatiently

Well said Bill with more provoking slowness as if he were communing
with himself rather than Brice Harrys mighty proud and high toned
and to be given away like this has cut down into his heart you bet It
aint the money hes thinkin of its this split in the gangthe loss
of his power ez boss ye seeand ef he could get hold o them chaps
hed let the money slide ez long ez they didnt get it So youve got a
detective on your side thats worth the whole police force of Californy
Ye never heard anything about Snapshot Harry did ye asked Bill
carelessly raising his eyes to Brices eager face

The young man flushed slightly Very little he said At the same time
a vision of the pretty girl in the settlers cabin flashed upon him with
a new significance

Hes more than half white in some ways said Bill thoughtfully and
they say he lives somewhere about here in a cabin in the bush with a
crippled sister and her darter who both swear by him It mightnt be
hard to find himef a man was dead set on it

Brice faced about with determined eyes ILL DO IT he said quietly

Ye might said Bill still more deliberately stroking his beard
mention my name ef ye ever get to see him

Your name ejaculated the astonished Brice

My name repeated Bill calmly He knows its my bounden duty to kill
him ef I get the chance and I know that hed plug me full o holes in
a minit ef thar war a necessity for it But in these yer affairs sonny
it seems to be the understood thing by the kempany that Im to keep
fiery young squirts like you and chuckleheaded passengers like
themjerking his thumb towards the other roomfrom gettin
themselves killed by their rashness So ontil the kempany fill the top
o that coach with men who aint got any business to do BUT fightin
other men who aint got any other business to do BUT to fight themthe
odds are agin us Harry has always acted square to methats how I
know he aint in this sneakthief business and why he didnt foller us
suspectin suthin and Ive always acted square to him All the same
Id like ter hev seen his face when that box was opened Lordy Here
Bill again collapsed in his silent paroxysm of mirth Ye might tell him
how I laughed

I would hardly do that Bill said the young man smiling in spite of
himself But youve given me an idea and Ill work it out

Bill glanced at the young fellows kindling eyes and flushing cheek and
nodded Well rastle with that idea later on sonny Ill fix you all
right in my report to the kempany but the rest you must work alone
Ive started out the usual posse circusridin down the road after
Harry Hed be a rough customer to meet just now continued Bill with
a chuckle ef thar was the ghost of a chance o them comin up with
him for him and his gang is scattered miles away by this He paused
tossed off another glass of whiskey wiped his mouth and saying
to Brice with a wink Its about time to go and comfort them thar
passengers led the way through the crowded barroom into the stage
office

The spectacle of Bills humorously satisfied face and Brices bright
eyes and heightened color was singularly effective The inside
passengers who had experienced neither the excitement nor the danger of
the robbery yet had been obliged to listen to the hairbreadth escapes
of the others poohpoohed the whole affair and even the outsides
themselves were at last convinced that the robbery was a slight one
with little or no loss to the company The clamor subsided almost as
suddenly as it had arisen the wiser passengers fashioned their attitude
on the sangfroid of Yuba Bill and the whole coach load presently
rolled away as complacently as if nothing had happened


II

The robbery furnished the usual amount of copy for the local press
There was the inevitable compliment to Yuba Bill for his wellknown
coolness the conduct of the young expressman who though new to the
service displayed an intrepidity that only succumbed to numbers was
highly commended and even the passengers received their meed of
praise not forgetting the lady who accepted the incident with the
lighthearted pleasantry characteristic of the Californian woman There
was the usual allusion to the necessity of a Vigilance Committee to
cope with this organized lawlessness but it is to be feared that the
readers of The Red Dog Clarion however ready to lynch a horse thief
were of the opinion that rich stage express companies were quite able to
take care of their own property

It was with full cognizance of these facts and their uselessness to him
that the next morning Mr Ned Brice turned from the road where the
coach had just halted on the previous night and approached the settlers
cabin If a little less sanguine than he was in Yuba Bills presence
he was still doggedly inflexible in his design whatever it might have
been for he had not revealed it even to Yuba Bill It was his own it
was probably crude and youthful in its directness but for that reason
it was probably more convincing than the vacillations of older counsel

He paused a moment at the closed door conscious however of some
hurried movement within which signified that his approach had been
observed The door was opened and disclosed only the old woman The
same dogged expression was on her face as when he had last seen it
with the addition of querulous expectancy In reply to his polite
Goodmorning she abruptly faced him with her hands still on the door

Ye kin stop right there Ef yer want ter make any talk about this yar
robbery ye might ez well skedaddle to oncet for we aint takin any
today

I have no wish to talk about the robbery said Brice quietly and as
far as I can prevent it you will not be troubled by any questions If
you doubt my word or the intentions of the company perhaps you will
kindly read that

He drew from his pocket a still damp copy of The Red Dog Clarion and
pointed to a paragraph

Wots that she said querulously feeling for her spectacles

Shall I read it

Go on

He read it slowly aloud I grieve to say it had been jointly concocted
the night before at the office of the Clarion by himself and the young
journalistthe latters assistance being his own personal tribute to
the graces of Miss Flo It read as follows

The greatest assistance was rendered by Hiram Tarbox Esq a resident
of the vicinity in removing the obstruction which was no doubt
the preliminary work of some of the robber gang and in providing
hospitality for the delayed passengers In fact but for the timely
warning of Yuba Bill by Mr Tarbox the coach might have crashed into
the tree at that dangerous point and an accident ensued more disastrous
to life and limb than the robbery itself

The sudden and unmistakable delight that expanded the old womans mouth
was so convincing that it might have given Brice a tinge of remorse over
the success of his stratagem had he not been utterly absorbed in his
purpose Hiram she shouted suddenly

The old man appeared from some back door with a promptness that proved
his near proximity and glanced angrily at Brice until he caught sight
of his wifes face Then his anger changed to wonder

Read that again young feller she said exultingly

Brice reread the paragraph aloud for Mr Tarboxs benefit

That ar Hiram Tarbox Esquire means YOU Hiram she gasped in
delighted explanation

Hiram seized the paper read the paragraph himself spread out the whole
page examined it carefully and then a fatuous grin began slowly to
extend itself over his whole face invading his eyes and ears until
the heavy harsh dogged lines of his nostrils and jaws had utterly
disappeared

Bgosh he said thats square Kin I keep it

Certainly said Brice I brought it for you

Is that all ye came for said Hiram with sudden suspicion

No said the young man frankly Yet he hesitated a moment as he added
I would like to see Miss Flora

His hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion
than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference With their
knowledge and pride in their relatives fascinations they felt it could
have but one meaning Hiram wiped his mouth with his hand assumed a
demure expression glanced at his wife and answered

She aint here now

Mr Brices face displayed his disappointment But the true lover
holds a talisman potent with old and young Mrs Tarbox felt a sneaking
maternal pity for this suddenly stricken Strephon

Shes gone home she added more gentlywent at sunup this mornin

Home repeated Brice Wheres that

Mrs Tarbox looked at her husband and hesitated Then she saida little
in her old mannerHer uncles

Can you direct me the way there asked Brice simply

The astonishment in their faces presently darkened into suspicion again
Ef thats your little game began Hiram with a lowering brow

I have no little game but to see her and speak with her said Brice
boldly I am alone and unarmed as you see he continued pointing
to his empty belt and small dispatch bag slung on his shoulder and
certainly unable to do any one any harm I am willing to take what risks
there are And as no one knows of my intention nor of my coming here
whatever might happen to me no one need know it You would be safe from
questioning

There was that hopeful determination in his manner that overrode their
resigned doggedness Ef we knew how to direct you thar said the old
woman cautiously yed be killed outer hand afore ye even set eyes on
the girl The house is in a holler with hills kept by spies yed be a
dead man as soon as ye crossed its boundary

Wot do YOU know about it interrupted her husband quickly in
querulous warning Wot are ye talkin about

You leave me alone Hiram I aint goin to let that young feller
get popped off without a show or without knowin jest wot hes got to
tackle nohow ye kin fix it And cant ye see hes bound to go whatever
ye says

Mr Tarbox saw this fact plainly in Brices eyes and hesitated

The most that I kin tell ye he said gloomily is the way the gal
takes when she goes from here but how far it is or if it aint a
blind I cant swar for I hevnt bin thar myself and Harry never comes
here but on an off night when the coach aint runnin and thars no
travel He stopped suddenly and uneasily as if he had said too much

Thar ye go Hiram and ye talk of others gabblin So ye might as well
tell the young feller how that thar aint but one way and thats the
way Harry takes too when he comes yer oncet in an age to talk to his
own flesh and blood and see a Christian face that aint agin him

Mr Tarbox was silent Ye know whar the tree was thrown down on the
road he said at last

Yes

The mountain rises straight up on the right side of the road all hazel
brush and thornwhar a goat couldnt climb

Yes

But thats a lie for thars a little trail not a foot wide runs up
from the road for a mile keepin it in view all the while but bein
hidden by the brush Ye kin see everything from thar and hear a
teamster spit on the road

Go on said Brice impatiently

Then it goes up and over the ridge and down the other side into a
little gulch until it comes to the canyon of the North Fork where the
stage road crosses over the bridge high up The trail winds round the
bank of the Fork and comes out on the LEFT side of the stage road about
a thousand feet below it Thats the valley and hollow whar Harry lives
and thats the only way it can be found For all along the LEFT of the
stage road is a sheer pitch down that thousand feet whar no one kin git
up or down

I understand said Brice with sparkling eyes Ill find my way all
right

And when ye git thar look out for yourself put in the woman
earnestly Ye may have regular greenhorns luck and pick up Flo afore
ye cross the boundary for shes that bold that when she gets lonesome
o stayin thar she goes wanderin out o bounds

Hev ye any weppinany shootiniron about ye asked Tarbox with a
latent suspicion

The young man smiled and again showed his empty belt None he said
truthfully

I aint sure ef that aint the safest thing arter all with a shot like
Harry remarked the old man grimly Well so long he added and
turned away

It was clearly a leavetaking and Brice warmly thanking them both
returned to the road

It was not far to the scene of the obstruction yet but for Tarboxs
timely hint the little trail up the mountain side would have escaped
his observation Ascending he soon found himself creeping along a
narrow ledge of rock hidden from the road that ran fifty yards below by
a thick network growth of thorn and bramble which still enabled him to
see its whole parallel length Perilous in the extreme to any hesitating
foot at one point directly above the obstruction the ledge itself
was missingbroken away by the fall of the tree from the forest crest
higher up For an instant Brice stood dizzy and irresolute before the
gap Looking down for a foothold his eye caught the faint imprint of
a womans shoe on a clayey rock projecting midway of the chasm It must
have been the young girls footprint made that morning for the narrow
toe was pointed in the direction she would go Where SHE could pass
should he shrink from going Without further hesitation he twined his
fingers around the roots above him and half swung half pulled himself
along until he once more felt the ledge below him

From time to time as he went on along the difficult track the narrow
little toeprint pointed the way to him like an arrow through the
wilds It was a pleasant thought and yet a perplexing one Would he
have undertaken this quest just to see her Would he be content with
that if his other motive failed For as he made his way up to the ridge
he was more than once assailed by doubts of the practical success of his
enterprise In the excitement of last night and even the hopefulness
of the early morning it seemed an easy thing to persuade the vain and
eccentric highwayman that their interests might be identical and
to convince him that his Brices assistance to recover the stolen
greenbacks and insure the punishment of the robber with the possible
addition of a reward from the express company would be an inducement
for them to work together The risks that he was running seemed to his
youthful fancy to atone for any defects in his logic or his plans Yet
as he crossed the ridge leaving the civilized highway behind him
and descended the narrow trail which grew wilder at each step his
arguments seemed no longer so convincing He now hurried forward
however with a feverish haste to anticipate the worst that might befall
him

The trail grew more intricate in the deep ferns the friendly little
footprint had vanished in this primeval wilderness As he pushed through
the gorge he could hear at last the roar of the North Fork forcing its
way through the canyon that crossed the gorge at right angles At last
he reached its current shut in by two narrow precipitous walls that
were spanned five hundred feet above by the stage road over a perilous
bridge As he approached the gloomy canyon he remembered that the
river seen from above seemed to have no banks but to have cut its way
through the solid rock

He found however a faint ledge made by caught driftwood from the
current and the debris of the overhanging cliffs Again the narrow
footprint on the ooze was his guide At last emerging from the canyon
a strange view burst upon his sight The river turned abruptly to the
right and following the mountain side left a small hollow completely
walled in by the surrounding heights To his left was the ridge he had
descended from on the other side and he now understood the singular
detour he had made He was on the other side of the stage road also
which ran along the mountain shelf a thousand feet above him The wall
a sheer cliff made the hollow inaccessible from that side Little hills
covered with buckeye encompassed it It looked like a sylvan retreat
and yet was as secure in its isolation and approaches as the outlaws
den that it was

He was gazing at the singular prospect when a shot rang in the air It
seemed to come from a distance and he interpreted it as a signal But
it was followed presently by another and putting his hand to his hat to
keep it from falling he found that the upturned brim had been pierced
by a bullet He stopped at this evident hint and taking his dispatch
bag from his shoulder placed it significantly upon a boulder and
looked around as if to await the appearance of the unseen marksman
The rifle shot rang out again the bag quivered and turned over with a
bullet hole through it

He took out his white handkerchief and waved it Another shot followed
and the handkerchief was snapped from his fingers torn from corner
to corner A feeling of desperation and fury seized him he was being
played with by a masked and skillful assassin who only waited until
it pleased him to fire the deadly shot But this time he could see the
rifle smoke drifting from under a sycamore not a hundred yards away He
set his white lips together but with a determined face and unfaltering
step walked directly towards it In another moment he believed and
almost hoped that all would be over With such a marksman he would not
be maimed but killed outright

He had not covered half the distance before a man lounged out from
behind the tree carelessly shouldering his rifle He was tall but
slightly built with an amused critical manner and nothing about him
to suggest the bloodthirsty assassin He met Brice halfway dropping his
rifle slantingly across his breast with his hands lightly grasping the
lock and gazed at the young man curiously

You look as if youd had a big scare old man but youve clear grit
for all that he said with a critical and reassuring smile Now
what are you doing here Stay he continued as Brices parched lips
prevented him from replying immediately I ought to know your face
Hello youre the expressman His glance suddenly shifted and swept
past Brice over the ground beyond him to the entrance of the hollow but
his smile returned as he apparently satisfied himself that the young man
was alone Well what do you want

I want to see Snapshot Harry said Brice with an effort His voice
came back more slowly than his color but that was perhaps hurried by a
sense of shame at his physical weakness

What you want is a drop o whiskey said the stranger good humoredly
taking his arm and well find it in that shanty just behind the tree
To Brices surprise a few steps in that direction revealed a fairsized
cabin with a slight pretentiousness about it of neatness comfort and
picturesque effect far superior to the Tarbox shanty A few flowers
were in boxes on the windowsigns as Brice fancied of feminine taste
When they reached the threshold somewhat of this quality was also
visible in the interior When Brice had partaken of the whiskey
the stranger who had kept silence pointed to a chair and said
smilingly

I am Henry Dimwood alias Snapshot Harry and this is my house

I came to speak with you about the robbery of greenbacks from the coach
last night began Brice hurriedly with a sudden access of hope at his
reception I mean of coursehe stopped and hesitatedthe actual
robbery before YOU stopped us

What said Harry springing to his feet do you mean to say YOU knew
it

Brices heart sank but he remained steadfast and truthful Yes he
said I knew it when I handed down the box I saw that the lock had
been forced but I snapped it together again It was my fault Perhaps I
should have warned you but I am solely to blame

Did Yuba Bill know of it asked the highwayman with singular
excitement

Not at the time I give you my word replied Brice quickly thinking
only of loyalty to his old comrade I never told him till we reached
the station

And he knew it then repeated Harry eagerly

Yes

Did he say anything Did he do anything Did he look astonished

Brice remembered Bills uncontrollable merriment but replied vaguely
and diplomatically He was certainly astonished

A laugh gathered in Snapshot Harrys eyes which at last overspread his
whole face and finally shook his frame as he sat helplessly down again
Then wiping his eyes he said in a shaky voice

It would have been sure death to have trusted myself near that station
but I think Id have risked it just to have seen Bills face when you
told him Just think of it Bill who was a match for anybody Bill
who was never caught napping Bill who only wanted supreme control
of things to wipe me off the face of the earth Bill who knew how
everything was done and could stop it if he chose and then to have
been ROBBED TWICE IN ONE EVENING BY MY GANG Yes sir Yuba Bill and
his rotten old coach were GONE THROUGH TWICE INSIDE HALF AN HOUR by the
gang

Then you knew of it too said Brice in uneasy astonishment

Afterwards my young friendlike Yuba Billafterwards He stopped
his whole expression changed It was done by two sneaking hounds he
said sharply one whom I suspected before and one a new hand a pal
of his They were detached to watch the coach and be satisfied that the
greenbacks were aboard for it isnt my style to hold up except
for something special They were to take seats on the coach as far as
Ringwood Station three miles below where we held you up and to get out
there and pass the word to us that it was all right They didnt that
made us a little extra careful seeing something was wrong but never
suspecting THEM We found out afterwards that they got one of my scouts
to cut down that tree saying it was my orders and a part of our game
calculating in the stoppage and confusion to collar the swag and get off
with it Without knowing it YOU played into their hands by going into
Tarboxs cabin

But how did you know this interrupted Brice in wonder

They forgot one thing continued Snapshot Harry grimly They forgot
that half an hour before and half an hour after a stage is stopped we
have that road patrolled every foot of it While I was opening the box
in the brush the two fools sneaking along the road came slap upon one
of my patrols and then tried to run for it One was dropped but before
he was plugged full of holes and hung up on a tree he confessed and
said the other man who escaped had the greenbacks

Brices face fell Then they are lost he said bitterly

Not unless he eats themas he may want to do before Im done on him
for he must either starve or come out That road is still watched by my
men from Tarboxs cabin to the bridge Hes there somewhere and cant
get forward or backward Look he said rising and going to the door
That road he pointed to the stage roada narrow ledge flanked on
one side by a precipitous mountain wall and on the other by an equally
precipitate descentis his limit and tether and he cant escape on
either side

But the trail

There is but one entrance to itthe way you came and that is guarded
too From the time you entered it until you reached the bottom you were
signaled here from point to point HE would have been dropped I merely
gave YOU a hint of what might have happened to you if you were up to
any little game You took it like a white man Come now What is your
business

Thus challenged Brice plunged with youthful hopefulness into his plan
if as he voiced it it seemed to him a little extravagant he was
buoyed up by the frankness of the highwayman who also had treated
the double robbery with a levity that seemed almost as extravagant He
suggested that they should work together to recover the money that the
express company should know that the unprecedented stealthy introduction
of robbers in the guise of passengers was not Snapshot Harrys method
and he repudiated it as unmanly and unsportsmanlike and that by using
his superior skill and knowledge of the locality to recover the money
and deliver the culprit into the companys hands he would not only earn
the reward that they should offer but that he would evoke a sentiment
that all Californians would understand and respect The highwayman
listened with a tolerant smile but to Brices surprise this appeal
to his vanity touched him less than the prospective punishment of the
thief

It would serve the dd hound right he muttered if instead of
being shot like a man he was made to do time in prison like the
ordinary sneak thief that he is When Brice had concluded he said
briefly The only trouble with your plans my young friend is that
about twentyfive men have got to consider them and have THEIR say
about it Every man in my gang is a shareholder in these greenbacks for
I work on the square and its for him to say whether hell give them up
for a reward and the good opinion of the express company Perhaps he
went on with a peculiar smile its just as well that you tried it on
me first However Ill sound the boys and see what comes of it but
not until youre safe off the premises

And youll let me assist you said Brice eagerly

Snapshot Harry smiled again Well if you come across the dd thief
and you recognize him and can get the greenbacks from him Ill pass
over the game to you He rose and added apparently by way of farewell
Perhaps its just as well that I should give you a guide part of the
way to prevent accidents He went to a door leading to an adjoining
room and called Flo

Brices heart leaped If he had forgotten her in the excitement of his
interview he atoned for it by a vivid blush Her own color was a little
heightened as she slipped into the room but the two managed to look
demurely at each other without a word of recognition

This is my niece Flora said Snapshot Harry with a slight wave of
the hand that was by no means uncourtly and her company will keep you
from any impertinent questioning as well as if I were with you This is
Mr Brice Flo who came to see me on business and has quite forgotten
my practical joking

The girl acknowledged Brices bow with a shyness very different from
her manner of the evening before Brice felt embarrassed and evidently
showed it for his host with a smile put an end to the constraint
by shaking the young mans hand heartily bidding him goodby and
accompanying him to the door

Once on their way Mr Brices spirits returned I told you last
night he said that I hoped to meet you the next time with a better
introduction You suggested your uncles Well are you satisfied

But you didnt come to see ME said the girl mischievously

How do you know what my intentions were returned the young man
gayly gazing at the girls charming face with a serious doubt as to the
singleness of his own intentions

Oh because I know she answered with a toss of her brown head I
heard what you said to uncle Harry

Mr Brices brow contracted Perhaps you saw me too when I came he
said with a slight touch of bitterness as he thought of his reception

Miss Flo laughed Brice walked on silently the girl was heartless and
worthy of her education After a pause she said demurely I knew he
wouldnt hurt youbut YOU didnt Thats where you showed your grit in
walking straight on

And I suppose you were greatly amused he replied scornfully

The girl lifted her arms a little wearily as with a half sigh she
readjusted her brown braids under her uncles gray slouch hat which she
had caught up as she passed out Thar aint much to laugh at here she
said But it was mighty funny when you tried to put your hat straight
and then found thur was that bullet hole right through the brim And the
way you stared at itLordy

Her musical laugh was infectious and swept away his outraged dignity
He laughed too At last she said gazing at his hat It wont do for
you to go back to your folks wearin that sort o thing Here Take
mine With a saucy movement she audaciously lifted his hat from his
head and placed her own upon it

But this is your uncles hat he remonstrated

All the same he spoiled yours she laughed adjusting his hat upon
her own head But Ill keep yours to remember you by Ill loop it up
by this hole and itll look mighty purty Jes see She plucked a
wild rose from a bush by the wayside and passing the stalk through the
bullet hole pinned the brim against the crown by a thorn There she
said putting on the hat again with a little affectation of coquetry
hows that

Mr Brice thought it very picturesque and becoming to the graceful head
and laughing eyes beneath it and said so Then becoming in his turn
audacious he drew nearer to her side

I suppose you know the forfeit of putting on a gentlemans hat

Apparently she did for she suddenly made a warning gesture and said
Not here It would be a bigger forfeit than youd keer fo Before he
could reply she turned aside as if quite innocently and passed into
the shade of a fringe of buckeyes He followed quickly I didnt mean
that she said but in the mean time he had kissed the pink tip of her
ear under its brown coils He was nevertheless somewhat discomfited
by her undisturbed manner and serene face Ye dont seem to mind bein
shot at she said with an odd smile but it wont do for you to
kalkilate that EVERYBODY shoots as keerfully as uncle Harry

I dont understand he replied struck by her manner

Ye aint very complimentary or youd allow that other folks might be
wantin what you took just now and might consider you was poachin
she returned gravely My best and strongest holt among those men is
that uncle Harry would kill the first one who tried anything like that
onand they know it Thats how I get all the liberty I want here and
can come and go alone as I like

Brices face flushed quickly with genuine shame and remorse Do forgive
me he said hurriedly I didnt thinkIm a brute and a fool

Uncle Harry allowed you was either drunk or a born idiot when you was
promenadin into the valley just now she said with a smile

And what did you think he asked a little uneasily

I thought you didnt look like a drinkin man she answered
audaciously

Brice bit his lip and walked on silently at which she cast a sidelong
glance under her widely spaced heavy lashes and said demurely I
thought last night it was mighty good for you to stand up for your
frien Yuba Bill and then after ye knew who I was to let the folks
see you kinder cottoned to me too Not in the style o that landgrabber
Heckshill nor that peart newspaper man neither Of course I gave them
as good as they sent she went on with a little laugh but Brice could
see that her sensitive lip in profile had the tremulous and resentful
curve of one who was accustomed to slight and annoyance Was it possible
that this reckless selfcontained girl felt her position keenly

I am proud to have your good opinion he said with a certain respect
mingled with his admiring glance even if I have not your uncles

Oh he likes you well enough or he wouldnt have hearkened to you a
minute she said quickly When you opened out about them greenbacks I
jes clutched my cheer SO she illustrated her words with a gesture
of her hands and her face actually seemed to grow pale at the
recollectionand I nigh started up to stop ye but that idea of Yuba
Bill bein robbed TWICE I think tickled him awful But it was lucky none
o the gang heard ye or suspected anything I reckon thats why he sent
me with youto keep them from doggin you and askin questions that
a straight man like you would be sure to answer But they darent
come nigh ye as long as Im with you She threw back her head and
rosecrested hat with a mock air of protection that however had a
certain real pride in it

I am very glad of that if it gives me the chance of having your
company alone returned Brice smiling and very grateful to your
uncle whatever were his reasons for making you my guide But you have
already been that to me and he told her of the footprints But for
you he added with gentle significance I should not have been here

She was silent for a moment and he could only see the back of her head
and its heavy brown coils After a pause she asked abruptly Wheres
your handkerchief

He took it from his pocket her ingenious uncles bullet had torn rather
than pierced the cambric

I thought so she said gravely examining it but I kin mend it as
good as new I reckon you allow I cant sew she continued but I do
heaps of mendin as the digger squaw and Chinamen we have here do only
the coarser work Ill send it back to you and meanwhiles you keep
mine

She drew a handkerchief from her pocket and handed it to him To his
great surprise it was a delicate one beautifully embroidered and
utterly incongruous to her station The idea that flashed upon him
it is to be feared showed itself momentarily in his hesitation and
embarrassment

She gave a quick laugh Dont be frightened Its bought and paid for
Uncle Harry dont touch passengers fixins that aint his style
You oughter know that Yet in spite of her laugh he could see the
sensitive pout of her lower lip

I was only thinking he said hurriedly and sympathetically that it
was too fine for me But I will be proud to keep it as a souvenir of
you Its not too pretty for THAT

Uncle gets me these things He dont keer what they cost she went on
ignoring the compliment Why Ive got awfully fine gowns up there that
I only wear when I go to Marysville oncet in a while

Does he take you there asked Brice

No she answered quietly Nota little defiantlythat hes
afeard for they cant prove anything against him no man kin swear to
him and thar aint an officer that keers to go for him But hes that
shy for ME he dont keer to have me mixed with him

But nobody recognizes you

Sometimesbut I dont keer for that She cocked her hat a little
audaciously but Brice noticed that her arms afterwards dropped at her
side with the same weary gesture he had observed before Whenever I go
into shops its always Yes miss and No miss and Certainly
Miss Dimwood Oh theyre mighty respectful I reckon they allow that
Snapshot Harrys rifle carries far

Presently she faced him again for their conversation had been carried
on in profile There was a critical searching look in her brown eyes

Here Im talkin to you as if you were oneMr Brice was positive
she was going to say one of the gang but she hesitated and concluded
one of my relationslike cousin Hiram

I wish you would think of me as being as true a friend said the young
man earnestly

She did not reply immediately but seemed to be examining the distance
They were not far from the canyon now and the river bank A fringe of
buckeyes hid the base of the mountain which had begun to tower up above
them to the invisible stage road overhead I am going to be a real
guide to you now she said suddenly When we reach that buckeye corner
and are out of sight we will turn into it instead of going through the
canyon You shall go up the mountain to the stage road from THIS side

But it is impossible he exclaimed in astonishment Your uncle said
so

Coming DOWN but not going up she returned with a laugh I found
it and no one knows it but myself

He glanced up at the towering cliff its nearly perpendicular flanks
were seamed with fissures some clefts deeply set with stunted growths
of thorn and scrub but still sheer and forbidding and then glanced
back at her incredulously I will show you she said answering his
look with a smile of triumph I havent tramped over this whole valley
for nothing But wait until we reach the river bank They must think
that weve gone through the canyon

They

Yesany one who is watching us said the girl dryly

A few steps further on brought them to the buckeye thicket which
extended to the river bank and mouth of the canyon The girl lingered
for a moment ostentatiously before it and then saying Come suddenly
turned at right angles into the thicket Brice followed and the next
moment they were hidden by its friendly screen from the valley On the
other side rose the mountain wall leaving a narrow trail before them
It was composed of the rocky debris and fallen trees of the cliff from
which buckeyes and larches were now springing It was uneven irregular
and slowly ascending but the young girl led the way with the free
footstep of a mountaineer and yet a grace that was akin to delicacy
Nor could he fail to notice that after the Western girls fashion she
was shod more elegantly and lightly than was consistent with the rude
and rustic surroundings It was the same slim shoeprint which had
guided him that morning Presently she stopped and seemed to be gazing
curiously at the cliff side Brice followed the direction of her eyes
On a protruding bush at the edge of one of the wooded clefts of the
mountain flank something was hanging and in the freshening southerly
wind was flapping heavily like a ravens wing or as if still saturated
with the last nights rain Thats mighty queer said Flo gazing
intently at the unsightly and incongruous attachment to the shrub which
had a vague weird suggestion It wasnt there yesterday

It looks like a mans coat remarked Brice uneasily

Whew said the girl Then somebody has come down who wont go up
again Theres a lot of fresh rocks and brush here too Whats that
She was pointing to a spot some yards before them where there had been a
recent precipitation of debris and uprooted shrubs But mingled with it
lay a mass of rags strangely akin to the tattered remnant that flagged
from the bush a hundred feet above them The girl suddenly uttered a
sharp feminine cry of mingled horror and disgustthe first weakness
of sex she had shownand recoiling grasped Brices arm Dont go
there Come away

But Brice had already seen that which while it shocked him was urging
him forward with an invincible fascination Gently releasing himself
and bidding the girl stand back he moved toward the unsightly heap
Gradually it disclosed a grotesque caricature of a human figure but so
maimed and doubled up that it seemed a stuffed and fallen scarecrow As
is common in men stricken suddenly down by accident in the fullness of
life the clothes asserted themselves before all else with a hideous
ludicrousness obliterating even the majesty of death in their helpless
yet ironical incongruity The garments seemed to have never fitted the
wearer but to have been assumed in ghastly jocularitya boot half off
the swollen foot a ripped waistcoat thrown over the shoulder were like
the properties of some low comedian At first the body appeared to be
headless but as Brice cleared away the debris and lifted it he saw
with horror that the head was twisted under the shoulder and swung
helplessly from the dislocated neck But that horror gave way to a more
intense and thrilling emotion as he saw the facealthough strangely
free from laceration or disfigurement and impurpled and distended into
the simulation of a selfcomplacent smilewas a face he recognized It
was the face of the cynical traveler in the coachthe man who he was
now satisfied had robbed it

A strange and selfish resentment took possession of him Here was the
man through whom he had suffered shame and peril and who even now
seemed complacently victorious in death He examined him closely his
coat and waistcoat had been partly torn away in his fall his shirt
still clung to him but through its torn front could be seen a heavy
treasure belt encircling his waist Forgetting his disgust Brice tore
away the shirt and unloosed the belt It was saturated with water like
the rest of the clothing but its pocket seemed heavy and distended In
another instant he had opened it and discovered the envelope containing
the packet of greenbacks its seal still inviolate and unbroken It was
the stolen treasure

A faint sigh recalled him to himself The girl was standing a few feet
from him regarding him curiously

Its the thief himself he said in a breathless explanation In
trying to escape he must have fallen from the road above But here are
the greenbacks safe We must go back to your uncle at once he said
excitedly Come

Are you mad she cried in astonishment

No returned Brice in equal astonishment but you know I agreed with
him that we should work together to recover the money and I must show
him our good luck

He told you that if you met the thief and could get the money from him
you were welcome to it said the girl gravely and you HAVE got it

But not in the way he meant returned Brice hurriedly This mans
death is the result of his attempting to escape from your uncles guards
along the road the merit of it belongs to them and your uncle It would
be cowardly and mean of me to take advantage of it

The girl looked at him with an expression of mingled admiration and
pity But the guards were placed there before he ever saw you said
she impatiently And whatever uncle Harry may want to do he must do
what the gang says And with the money once in their possession or
even in yours if they knew it I wouldnt give much for its chancesor
YOURS eitherfor gettin out o this hollow again

But if THEY are treacherous that is no reason why I should be so
protested Brice stoutly

Youve no right to say they were treacherous when they knew nothing of
your plans said the girl sharply Your company would have more call
to say YOU were treacherous to it for making a plan without consultin
them Brice winced for he had never thought of that before You can
offer that reward AFTER you get away from here with the greenbacks
But she added proudly with a toss of her head go back if you want
to Tell him all Tell him where you found ittell him I did not take
you through the canyon but was showin you a new trail I had never
shown to THEM Tell him that I am a traitor for I have given them and
him away to you a stranger and that you consider yourself the only
straight and honest one about here

Brice flushed with shame Forgive me he said hurriedly you are
right and I am wrong again I will do just what you say I will first
place these greenbacks in a secure placeand then

Get away firstthats your only holt she interrupted him quickly
her eyes still flashing through indignant tears Come quick for I must
put you on the trail before they miss me

She darted forward he followed but she kept the lead as much he
fancied to evade his observation as to expedite his going Presently
they stopped before the sloping trunk of a huge pine that had long since
fallen from the height above but although splintered where it had
broken ground had preserved some fifty feet of its straight trunk erect
and leaning like a ladder against the mountain wall There she
said hurriedly pointing to its decaying but still projecting lateral
branches you climb itI have At the top youll find its stuck in a
cleft among the brush Theres a little hollow and an old waterway from
a spring above which makes a trail through the brush Its as good as
the trail you took from the stage road this mornin but its not as
safe comin down Keep along it to the spring and it will land ye jest
the other side of uncle Hirams cabin Go quick Ill wait here until
yeve reached the cleft

But you he said turning toward her how can I ever thank you

As if anticipating a leavetaking the girl had already withdrawn
herself a few yards away and simply made an upward gesture with her
hand Quick Up with you Every minute now is a risk to me

Thus appealed to Brice could only comply Perhaps he was a little hurt
at the girls evident desire to avoid a gentler parting Securing his
prized envelope within his breast he began to ascend the tree Its
inclination and the aid offered by the broken stumps of branches made
this comparatively easy and in a few moments he reached its top
and stood upon a little ledge in the wall A swift glance around
him revealed the whole waterway or fissure slanting upward along the
mountain face Then he turned quickly to look down the dizzy height At
first he could distinguish nothing but the top of the buckeyes and their
white clustering blossoms Then something flutteredthe torn white
handkerchief of his that she had kept And then he caught a single
glimpse of the flowerplumed hat receding rapidly among the trees and
Flora Dimwood was gone


III

In twentyfour hours Edward Brice was in San Francisco But although
successful and the bearer of the treasure it is doubtful if he
approached this end of his journey with the temerity he had shown on
entering the robbers valley A consciousness that the methods he
had employed might excite the ridicule if not the censure of his
principals or that he might have compromised them in his meeting with
Snapshot Harry considerably modified his youthful exultation It is
possible that Floras reproach which still rankled in his mind may
have quickened his sensitiveness on that point However he had resolved
to tell the whole truth except his episode with Flora and to place the
conduct of Snapshot Harry and the Tarboxes in as favorable a light as
possible But first he had recourse to the manager a man of shrewd
worldly experience who had recommended him to his place When he had
finished and handed him the treasured envelope the man looked at him
with a critical and yet not unkindly expression Perhaps its just as
well Brice that you did come to me at first and did not make your
report to the president and directors

I suppose said Brice diffidently that they wouldnt have liked my
communicating with the highwayman without their knowledge

More than thatthey wouldnt have believed your story

Not believe it cried Brice flushing quickly Do you think

The manager checked him with a laugh Hold on I believe every word
of it and why Because youve added nothing to it to make yourself the
regular hero Why with your opportunity and no one able to contradict
you you might have told me you had a handtohand fight with the
thief and had to kill him to recover the money and even brought your
handkerchief and hat back with the bullet holes to prove it Brice
winked as he thought of the fair possessor of those articles But as a
story for general circulation it wont do Have you told it to any one
else Does any one know what happened but yourself

Brice thought of Flora but he had resolved not to compromise her and
he had a consciousness that she would be equally loyal to him No one
he answered boldly

Very good And I suppose you wouldnt mind if it were kept out of the
newspapers Youre not hankering after a reputation as a hero

Certainly not said Brice indignantly

Well then well keep it where it is You will say nothing I will
hand over the greenbacks to the company but only as much of your story
as I think theyll stand Youre all right as it is Yuba Bill has
already set you up in his report to the company and the recovery of
this money will put you higher Only the PUBLIC need know nothing about
it

But asked Brice amazedly how can it be prevented The shippers who
lost the money will have to know that it has been recovered

Why should they The company will assume the risk and repay them just
the same Its a great deal better to have the reputation for accepting
the responsibility than for the shippers to think that they only get
their money through the accident of its recovery

Brice gasped at this large business truth Besides it occurred to him
that it kept the secret and Floras participation in it from Snapshot
Harry and the gang He had not thought of that before

Come continued the manager with official curtness What do you say
Are you willing to leave it to me

Brice hesitated a moment It was not what his impulsive truthful nature
had suggested It was not what his youthful fancy had imagined He had
not worked upon the sympathies of the company on behalf of Snapshot
Harry as he believed he would do He had not even impressed the manager
His story far from exciting a chivalrous sentiment had been pronounced
improbable Yet he reflected he had so far protected HER and he
consented with a sigh

Nevertheless the result ought to have satisfied him A dazzling check
inclosed in a letter of thanks from the company the next day and his
promotion from the road to the San Francisco office would have been
quite enough for any one but Edward Brice Yet he was grateful albeit
a little frightened and remorseful over his luck He could not help
thinking of the kindly tolerance of the highwayman the miserable death
of the actual thief which had proved his own salvation and above all
the generous highspirited girl who had aided his escape While on his
way to San Francisco and yet in the first glow of his success he had
written her a few lines from Marysville inclosed in a letter to Mr
Tarbox He had received no reply

Then a week passed He wrote again and still no reply Then a vague
feeling of jealousy took possession of him as he remembered her warning
hint of the attentions to which she was subjected and he became
singularly appreciative of Snapshot Harrys proficiency as a marksman
Then cruelest of all for your impassioned lover is no lover at all
if not cruel in his imaginings he remembered how she had evaded her
uncles espionage with HIM could she not equally with ANOTHER Perhaps
that was why she had hurried him awaywhy she had prevented
his returning to her uncle Following this came another week of
disappointment and equally miserable cynical philosophy in which
he persuaded himself he was perfectly satisfied with his material
advancement that it was the only outcome of his adventure to be
recognized and he was more miserable than ever

A month had passed when one morning he received a small package by
post The address was in a handwriting unknown to him but opening
the parcel he was surprised to find only a handkerchief neatly folded
Examining it closely he found it was his ownthe one he had given
her the rent made by her uncles bullet so ingeniously and delicately
mended as to almost simulate embroidery The joy that suddenly filled
him at this proof of her remembrance showed him too plainly how hollow
had been his cynicism and how lasting his hope Turning over the wrapper
eagerly he discovered what he had at first thought was some business
card It was indeed printed and not engraved in some common newspaper
type and bore the address Hiram Tarbox Land and Timber Agent 1101
California Street He again examined the parcel there was nothing
elsenot a line from HER But it was a clue at last and she had not
forgotten him He seized his hat and ten minutes later was breasting
the steep sand hill into which California Street in those days plunged
and again emerged at its crest with a few struggling houses

But when he reached the summit he could see that the outline of the
street was still plainly marked along the distance by cottages and
new suburban villalike blocks of houses No 1101 was in one of these
blocks a small tenement enough but a palace compared to Mr Tarboxs
Sierran cabin He impetuously rang the bell and without waiting to be
announced dashed into the little drawingroom and Mr Tarboxs presence
That had changed too Mr Tarbox was arrayed in a suit of clothes as
new as cheaply decorative as fresh and apparently as damp as his own
drawing room

Did you get my letter Did you give her the one I inclosed Why didnt
you answer burst out Brice after his first breathless greeting

Mr Tarboxs face here changed so suddenly into his old dejected
doggedness that Brice could have imagined himself back in the Sierran
cabin The man straightened and bowed himself at Brices questions and
then replied with bold deliberate emphasis

Yes I DID get your letter I DIDNT give no letter o yours to her
And I didnt answer your letter BEFORE for I didnt propose to answer
it AT ALL

Why demanded Brice indignantly

I didnt give her your letter because I didnt kalkilate to be any
gobetween twixt you and Snapshot Harrys niece Look yar Mr Brice
Sense I read that ar paragraph in that paper you gave me I allowed to
myself that it wasnt the square thing for me to have any more doins
with him and I quit it I jest chucked your letter in the fire I
didnt answer you because I reckoned Id no call to correspond with ye
and when I showed ye that trail over to Harrys camp it was ended Ive
got a house and business to look arter and it dont jibe with keepin
company with road agents Thats what I got outer that paper you gave
me Mr Brice

Rage and disgust filled Brice at the mans utter selfishness and
shameless desertion of his kindred none the less powerfully that he
remembered the part he himself had played in concocting the paragraph
Do you mean to say he demanded passionately that for the sake of
that foolish paragraph you gave up your own kindred That you truckled
to the mean prejudices of your neighbors and kept that poor defenseless
girl from the only honest roof she could find refuge under That you
dared to destroy my letter to her and made her believe I was as selfish
and ungrateful as yourself

Young feller said Mr Tarbox still more deliberately yet with a
certain dignity that Brice had never noticed before whats between you
and Flo and what rights she has fer thinkin ye ez selfish and ez
ongrateful ez meef she does I dunnobut when ye talk o me givin
up my kindred and sling such hogwash ez ongrateful and selfish
round this yer sittinroom mebbe it mout occur to ye that Harry
Dimwood might hev HIS opinion o what was ongrateful and selfish ef
Id played in between his niece and a young man o the express company
his natral enemy Its one thing to hev helped ye to see her in
her uncles own camp but another to help ye by makin a clandecent
postoffis o my cabin Ef instead o writin youd hev posted
yourself by comin to me you mout hev found out that when I broke with
Harry I offered to take Flo with me for good and allef hed keep
away from us And thats the kind o honest roof that that thar poor
defenseless girl got under when her crippled mother died three
weeks ago and left Harry free It was by trucklin to them mean
prejudices and readin that thar foolish paragraph that I settled
this thing then and thar

Brices revulsion of sentiment was so complete and the gratitude that
beamed in his eyes was so sincere that Mr Tarbox hardly needed the
profuse apologies which broke from him Forgive me he continued to
stammer I have wronged you wronged HEReverybody But as you know
Mr Tarbox how I have felt over this how deeplyhow passionately

It DOES make a man loony sometimes said Mr Tarbox relaxing into
demure dryness again so I reckon you DID Mebbe she reckoned so too
for she asked me to give you the handkercher I sent ye It looked as if
shed bin doin some fancy work on it

Brice glanced quickly at Mr Tarboxs face It was stolid and
imperturbable She had evidently kept the secret of what passed in
the hollow to herself For the first time he looked around the room
curiously I didnt know you were a land agent before he said

No more I was All that kem out o that paragraph Mr Brice That man
Heckshill who was so mighty perlite that night wrote to me afterwards
that he didnt know my name till hed seed that paragraph and he wanted
to know ef ez a wellknown citizen I could recommend him some timber
lands I recommended him half o my own quarter section and he took it
Hes puttin up a mill thar and thats another reason why we want peace
and quietness up thar Im tryin betwixt and between us Mr Brice to
get Harry to clar out and sell his rights in the valley and the water
power on the Fork to Heckshill and me Im opening a business here

Then youve left Mrs Tarbox with Miss Flora in your cabin while you
attend to business here said Brice tentatively

Not exactly Mr Brice The old woman thought it a good chance to come
to Frisco and put Flo in one o them Catholic convent schoolsthat
asks no questions whar the raw logs come from and turns em out
firstclass plank all round You foller me Mr Brice But Mrs Tarbox
is jest in the next room and would admire to tell ye all thisand Ill
go in and send her to you And with a patronizing wave of the hand Mr
Tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall

Mr Brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment
Flo separated from her detrimental uncle and placed in a convent
school Tarbox the obscure pioneer a shrewd speculator emerging into
success and taking the uncles place And all this within that month
which he had wasted with absurd repinings How feeble seemed his own
adventure and advancement how even ludicrous his pretensions to any
patronage and superiority How this common backwoodsman had set him in
his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and
Heckshill They had taught him a lesson perhaps even the sending back
of his handkerchief was part of it His heart grew heavy he walked to
the window and gazed out with a long sigh

A light laugh that might have been an echo of the one which had
attracted him that night in Tarboxs cabin fell upon his ear He turned
quickly to meet Flora Dimwoods laughing eyes shining upon him as she
stood in the doorway

Many a time during that month he had thought of this meetinghad
imagined what it would be likewhat would be his manner towards
herwhat would be her greeting and what they would say He would be
cold gentle formal gallant gay sad trustful reproachful even as
the moods in which he thought of her came to his foolish brain He would
always begin with respectful seriousness or a frankness equal to her
own but never never again would he offend as he had offended under the
buckeyes And now with her pretty face shining upon him all his plans
his speeches his preparations vanished and left him dumb Yet he moved
towards her with a brief articulate something on his lipssomething
between a laugh and a sighbut that really was a kiss andin point
of factpromptly folded her in his arms

Yet it was certainly direct and perhaps the best that could be done
for the young lady did not emerge from it as coolly as unemotionally
nor possibly as quickly as she had under the shade of the buckeyes But
she persuaded himby still holding his handto sit beside her on the
chilly highly varnished green rep sofa albeit to him it was a bank
in a bower of enchantment Then she said with adorable reproachfulness
You dont ask what I did with the body

Mr Edward Brice started He was young and unfamiliar with the evasive
expansiveness of the female mind at such supreme moments

The bodyoh yescertainly

I buried it myselfit was suthin too awfuland the gang would have
been sure to have found it and the empty belt I burned THAT So that
nobody knows nothin

It was not a time for strictly grammatical negatives and I am
afraid that the girls characteristically familiar speech even when
pathetically corrected here and there by the influence of the convent
endeared her the more to him And when she said And now Mr Edward
Brice sit over at that end of the sofy and lets talk they talked
They talked for an hour more or less continuously until they were
surprised by a discreet cough and the entrance of Mrs Tarbox Then
there was more talk and the discovery that Mr Brice was long due at
the office

Ye might drop in now and then whenever ye feel like it and Flo is at
home suggested Mrs Tarbox at parting

Mr Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month On one of
these occasions Mr Tarbox accompanied him to the door And nowez
everything is settled and in order Mr Brice and ef you should be
wantin to say anything about it to your bosses at the office ye may
mention MY name ez Flo Dimwoods second cousin and say Im a depositor
in their bank And with greater deliberation ef anything at any time
should be thrown up at ye for marryin a niece o Snapshot Harrys ye
might mention keerless like that Snapshot Harry under the name o
Henry J Dimwood has held shares in their old bank for years




A TREASURE OF THE REDWOODS


PART I

Mr Jack Fleming stopped suddenly before a lifeless and decaying
redwoodtree with an expression of disgust and impatience It was the
very tree he had passed only an hour before and he now knew he had been
describing that mysterious and hopeless circle familiar enough to those
lost in the woods

There was no mistaking the tree with its one broken branch which
depended at an angle like the arm of a semaphore nor did it relieve
his mind to reflect that his mishap was partly due to his own foolish
abstraction He was returning to camp from a neighboring mining town
and while indulging in the usual daydreams of a youthful prospector
had deviated from his path in attempting to make a short cut through the
forest He had lost the sun his only guide in the thickly interlaced
boughs above him which suffused though the long columnar vault only
a vague melancholy twilight He had evidently penetrated some unknown
seclusion absolutely primeval and untrodden The thick layers of
decaying bark and the desiccated dust of ages deadened his footfall and
invested the gloom with a profound silence

As he stood for a moment or two irresolute his ear by this time
attuned to the stillness caught the faint but distinct lap and trickle
of water He was hot and thirsty and turned instinctively in that
direction A very few paces brought him to a fallen tree at the foot of
its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly
but persistently loosened their hold on the soil and worked their ruin
A pool of cool and clear water formed by the disruption of the soil
overflowed and after a few yards sank again in the sodden floor

As he drank and bathed his head and hands in this sylvan basin he
noticed the white glitter of a quartz ledge in its depths and was
considerably surprised and relieved to find hard by an actual outcrop
of that rock through the thick carpet of bark and dust This betokened
that he was near the edge of the forest or some rocky opening He
fancied that the light grew clearer beyond and the presence of a few
fronds of ferns confirmed him in the belief that he was approaching a
different belt of vegetation Presently he saw the vertical beams of the
sun again piercing the opening in the distance With this prospect of
speedy deliverance from the forest at last secure he did not hurry
forward but on the contrary coolly retraced his footsteps to the spring
again The fact was that the instincts and hopes of the prospector were
strongly dominant in him and having noticed the quartz ledge and the
contiguous outcrop he determined to examine them more closely He
had still time to find his way home and it might not be so easy to
penetrate the wilderness again Unfortunately he had neither pick pan
nor shovel with him but a very cursory displacement of the soil around
the spring and at the outcrop with his hands showed him the usual red
soil and decomposed quartz which constituted an indication Yet none
knew better than himself how disappointing and illusive its results
often were and he regretted that he had not a pan to enable him to test
the soil by washing it at the spring If there were only a miners cabin
handy he could easily borrow what he wanted It was just the usual
luckthe things a man sees when he hasnt his gun with him

He turned impatiently away again in the direction of the opening When
he reached it he found himself on a rocky hillside sloping toward a
small green valley A light smoke curled above a clump of willows it
was from the chimney of a low dwelling but a second glance told him
that it was no miners cabin There was a larger clearing around the
house and some rude attempt at cultivation in a roughly fenced area
Nevertheless he determined to try his luck in borrowing a pick and pan
there at the worst he could inquire his way to the main road again

A hurried scramble down the hill brought him to the dwellinga
rambling addition of sheds to the usual log cabin But he was surprised
to find that its exterior and indeed the palings of the fence around
it were covered with the stretched and drying skins of animals The
pelts of bear panther wolf and fox were intermingled with squirrel
and wildcat skins and the displayed wings of eagle hawk and
kingfisher There was no trail leading to or from the cabin it seemed
to have been lost in this opening of the encompassing woods and left
alone and solitary

The barking of a couple of tethered hounds at last brought a figure to
the door of the nearest leanto shed It seemed to be that of a
young girl but it was clad in garments so ridiculously large and
disproportionate that it was difficult to tell her precise age A calico
dress was pinned up at the skirt and tightly girt at the waist by an
apronso long that one corner had to be tucked in at the apron
string diagonally to keep the wearer from treading on it An enormous
sunbonnet of yellow nankeen completely concealed her head and face but
allowed two knotted and twisted brown tails of hair to escape under its
frilled cape behind She was evidently engaged in some culinary work
and still held a large tin basin or pan she had been cleaning clasped to
her breast

Flemings eye glanced at it covetously ignoring the figure behind it
But he was diplomatic

I have lost my way in the woods Can you tell me in what direction the
main road lies

She pointed a small red hand apparently in the direction he had come
Straight over tharacross the hill

Fleming sighed He had been making a circuit of the forest instead of
going through itand this open space containing the cabin was on a
remote outskirt

How far is it to the road he asked

Jest a spell arter ye rise the hill ef ye keep longside the woods
But its a right smart chance beyond ef ye go through it

This was quite plain to him In the local dialect a spell was under
a mile a right smart chance might be three or four miles farther
Luckily the spring and outcrop were near the outskirts he would pass
near them again on his way He looked longingly at the pan which she
still held in her hands Would you mind lending me that pan for a
little while he said half laughingly

Wot for demanded the girl quickly Yet her tone was one of childish
curiosity rather than suspicion Fleming would have liked to avoid the
question and the consequent exposure of his discovery which a direct
answer implied But he saw it was too late now

I want to wash a little dirt he said bluntly

The girl turned her deep sunbonnet toward him Somewhere in its depths
he saw the flash of white teeth Go along with yeyere funnin she
said

I want to wash out some dirt in that panIm prospecting for gold he
said dont you understand

Are ye a miner

Well yesa sort of one he returned with a laugh

Then yed better be scootin out o this mighty quick afore dad comes
He dont cotton to miners and wont have em around Thats why he
lives out here

Well I dont live out here responded the young man lightly I
shouldnt be here if I hadnt lost my way and in half an hour Ill be
off again So Im not likely to bother him But he added as the girl
still hesitated Ill leave a deposit for the pan if you like

Leave a which

The money that the pans worth said Fleming impatiently

The huge sunbonnet stiffly swung around like the windsail of a ship
and stared at the horizon I dont want no money Ye kin git said the
voice in its depths

Look here he said desperately I only wanted to prove to you that
Ill bring your pan back safe Now look If you dont like to take
money Ill leave this ring with you until I come back There He
slipped a small specimen ring made out of his first gold findings from
his little finger

The sunbonnet slowly swung around again and stared at the ring Then the
little red right hand reached forward took the ring placed it on the
forefinger of the left hand with all the other fingers widely extended
for the sunbonnet to view and all the while the pan was still held
against her side by the other hand Fleming noticed that the hands
though tawny and not over clean were almost childlike in size and that
the forefinger was much too small for the ring He tried to fathom the
depths of the sunbonnet but it was dented on one side and he could
discern only a single pale blue eye and a thin black arch of eyebrow

Well said Fleming is it a go

Of course yell be comin back for it again said the girl slowly

There was so much of hopeless disappointment at that prospect in her
voice that Fleming laughed outright Im afraid I shall for I value
the ring very much he said

The girl handed him the pan Its our bread pan she said

It might have been anything for it was by no means new indeed it was
battered on one side and the bottom seemed to have been broken but it
would serve and Fleming was anxious to be off Thank you he said
briefly and turned away The hound barked again as he passed he heard
the girl say Shut your head Tige and saw her turn back into the
kitchen still holding the ring before the sunbonnet

When he reached the woods he attacked the outcrop he had noticed and
detached with his hands and the aid of a sharp rock enough of the loose
soil to fill the pan This he took to the spring and lowering the
pan in the pool began to wash out its contents with the centrifugal
movement of the experienced prospector The saturated red soil
overflowed the brim with that liquid ooze known as slumgullion and
turned the crystal pool to the color of blood until the soil was washed
away Then the smaller stones were carefully removed and examined and
then another washing of the now nearly empty pan showed the fine black
sand covering the bottom This was in turn as gently washed away

Alas the clean pan showed only one or two minute glistening yellow
scales like pinheads adhering from their specific gravity to the
bottom gold indeed but merely enough to indicate the color and
common to ordinary prospecting in his own locality

He tried another panful with the same result He became aware that the
pan was leaky and that infinite care alone prevented the bottom from
falling out during the washing Still it was an experiment and the
result a failure

Fleming was too old a prospector to take his disappointment seriously
Indeed it was characteristic of that performance and that period that
failure left neither hopelessness nor loss of faith behind it the
prospector had simply miscalculated the exact locality and was equally
as ready to try his luck again But Fleming thought it high time to
return to his own mining work in camp and at once set off to return the
pan to its girlish owner and recover his ring

As he approached the cabin again he heard the sound of singing It was
evidently the girls voice uplifted in what seemed to be a fragment of
some negro campmeeting hymn

 Dar was a poor man and his name it was Lazarum
 Lord bress de Lambglory hallelugerum
 Lord bress de Lamb

The first two lines had a brisk movement accented apparently by the
clapping of hands or the beating of a tin pan but the refrain Lord
bress de Lamb was drawn out in a lugubrious chant of infinite tenuity

 The rich man died and he went straight to hellerum
 Lord bress de Lambglory hallelugerum
 Lord bress de Lamb

Fleming paused at the cabin door Before he could rap the voice rose
again

 When ye see a poo man be sure to give him crumbsorum
 Lord bress de Lambglory hallelugerum
 Lord bress de Lamb

At the end of this interminable refrain drawn out in a youthful nasal
contralto Fleming knocked The girl instantly appeared holding the
ring in her fingers I reckoned it was you she said with an affected
briskness to conceal her evident dislike at parting with the trinket
There it is

But Fleming was too astounded to speak With the opening of the door
the sunbonnet had fallen back like a buggy top disclosing for the first
time the head and shoulders of the wearer She was not a child but
a smart young woman of seventeen or eighteen and much of his
embarrassment arose from the consciousness that he had no reason
whatever for having believed her otherwise

I hope I didnt interrupt your singing he said awkwardly

It was only one o mammys campmeetin songs said the girl

Your mother Is she in he asked glancing past the girl into the
kitchen

Taint mothershes dead Mammys our old nurse Shes gone to
Jimtown and taken my duds to get some new ones fitted to me These are
some o mothers

This accounted for her strange appearance but Fleming noticed that
the girls manner had not the slightest consciousness of their
unbecomingness nor of the charms of face and figure they had marred

She looked at him curiously Hev you got religion

Well no said Fleming laughing Im afraid not

Dad hezhes got it powful

Is that the reason he dont like miners asked Fleming

Take not to yourself the mammon of unrighteousness said the girl
with the confident air of repeating a lesson Thats what the Book
says

But I read the Bible too replied the young man

Dad says The letter killeth said the girl sententiously

Fleming looked at the trophies nailed on the walls with a vague wonder
if this peculiar Scriptural destructiveness had anything to do with his
skill as a marksman The girl followed his eye

Dads a mighty hunter afore the Lord

What does he do with these skins

Trades em off for grub and fixins But he dont believe in trottin
round in the mud for gold

Dont you suppose these animals would have preferred it if he had Gold
hunting takes nothing from anybody

The girl stared at him and then to his great surprise laughed instead
of being angry It was a very fascinating laugh in her imperfectly
nourished pale face and her little teeth revealed the bluish milky
whiteness of pips of young Indian corn

Wot yer lookin at she asked frankly

You he replied with equal frankness

Its them duds she said looking down at her dress I reckon I aint
got the hang o em

Yet there was not the slightest tone of embarrassment or even coquetry
in her manner as with both hands she tried to gather in the loose folds
around her waist

Let me help you he said gravely

She lifted up her arms with childlike simplicity and backed toward him
as he stepped behind her drew in the folds and pinned them around what
proved a very small waist indeed Then he untied the apron took it
off folded it in half and retied its curtailed proportions around the
waist It does feel a heap easier she said with a little shiver of
satisfaction as she lifted her round cheek and the tail of her blue
eyes with their brown lashes over her shoulder It was a tempting
momentbut Jack felt that the whole race of gold hunters was on trial
just then and was adamant Perhaps he was a gentle fellow at heart
too

I could loop up that dress also if I had more pins he remarked
tentatively Jack had sisters of his own

The pins were forthcoming In this operationa kind of festooningthe
girls petticoat a piece of common washedout blue flannel as pale
as her eyes but of the commonest material became visible but without
fear or reproach to either

There that looks more tidy said Jack critically surveying his work
and a little of the small ankles revealed The girl also examined it
carefully by its reflection on the surface of the saucepan Looks a
little like a chiny girl dont it

Jack would have resented this thinking she meant a Chinese until he
saw her pointing to a cheap crockery ornament representing a Dutch
shepherdess on the shelf There was some resemblance

You beat mammy out o sight she exclaimed gleefully It will jest
set her clear crazy when she sees me

Then you had better say you did it yourself said Fleming

Why asked the girl suddenly opening her eyes on him with relentless
frankness

You said your father didnt like miners and he mightnt like your
lending your pan to me

Im more afraid o lyin than o dad she said with an elevation of
moral sentiment that was however slightly weakened by the addition
Mammyll say anything Ill tell her to say

Well goodby said Fleming extending his hand

Ye didnt tell me what luck ye had with the pan she said delaying
taking his hand

Fleming shrugged his shoulders Oh my usual lucknothing he
returned with a smile

Ye seem to keer more for gettin yer old ring back than for any luck
she continued I reckon you aint much o a miner

Im afraid not

Ye didnt say wot yer name was in case dad wants to know

I dont think he will want to but its John Fleming

She took his hand You didnt tell me yours he said holding the
little red fingers in case I wanted to know

It pleased her to consider the rejoinder intensely witty She showed all
her little teeth threw away his hand and said

G long with ye Mr Fleming Its Tinka

Tinker

Yes short for KatinkaKatinka Jallinger

Goodby Miss Jallinger

Goodby Dads name is Henry Boone Jallinger of Kentucky ef ye was
ever askin

Thank you

He turned away as she swiftly reentered the house As he walked away
he half expected to hear her voice uplifted again in the campmeeting
chant but he was disappointed When he reached the top of the hill he
turned and looked back at the cabin

She was apparently waiting for this and waved him an adieu with the
humble pan he had borrowed It flashed a moment dazzlingly as it caught
the declining sun and then went out even obliterating the little
figure behind it


PART II

Mr Jack Fleming was indeed not much of a miner He and his
partnersboth as young hopeful and inefficient as himselfhad
for three months worked a claim in a mountain mining settlement
which yielded them a certain amount of healthy exercise goodhumored
grumbling and exalted independence To dig for three or four hours in
the morning smoke their pipes under a redwoodtree for an hour at
noon take up their labors again until sunset when they washed up
and gathered sufficient gold to pay for their daily wants was without
their seeking it or even knowing it the realization of a charming
socialistic ideal which better men than themselves had only dreamed of
Fleming fell back into this refined barbarism giving little thought to
his woodland experience and no revelation of it to his partners He had
transacted their business at the mining town His deviations en route
were nothing to them and small account to himself

The third day after his return he was lying under a redwood when his
partner approached him

You arent uneasy in your mind about any unpaid billsay a wash
billthat youre owing

Why

Theres a big nigger woman in camp looking for you shes got a folded
account paper in her hand It looks deucedly like a bill

There must be some mistake suggested Fleming sitting up

She says not and shes got your name pat enough Faulkner his other
partner headed her straight up the gulch away from camp while I came
down to warn you So if you choose to skedaddle into the brush out there
and lie low until we get her away well fix it

Nonsense Ill see her

His partner looked aghast at this temerity but Fleming jumping to his
feet at once set out to meet his mysterious visitor This was no easy
matter as the ingenious Faulkner was laboriously leading his charge up
the steep gulch road with great politeness but many audible misgivings
as to whether this was not Jack Flemings day for going to Jamestown

He was further lightening the journey by cheering accounts of the recent
depredations of bears and panthers in that immediate locality When
overtaken by Fleming he affected a start of joyful surprise to conceal
the look of warning which Fleming did not heedhaving no eyes but
for Faulkners companion She was a very fat negro woman panting with
exertion and suppressed impatience Flemings heart was filled with
compunction

Is you Marse Fleming she gasped

Yes said Fleming gently What can I do for you

Well Ye kin pick dis yar insek dis caterpillier she said pointing
to Faulkner off my paf Ye kin tell dis yar chipmunk dat when he comes
to showin me mule tracks for bar tracks hes barkin up de wrong
tree Dat when he tells me dat he sees panfers apromenadin round in de
short grass or hidin behime rocks in de open he haint talkin to no
nigger chile but a growed woman Ye kin tell him dat Mammy Curtis lived
in de woods afo he was born and hez seen more bars and mountain lyuns
dan he hez hairs in his mustarches

The word Mammy brought a flash of recollection to Fleming

I am very sorry he began but to his surprise the negro woman burst
into a goodtempered laugh

All right honey Slongs you is Marse Fleming and de man dat took
dat ar pan offer Tinka de odder day I aint mindin yo frens
bedevilments Ive got somefin fo you yar and a little box and she
handed him a folded paper

Fleming felt himself reddening he knew not why at which Faulkner
discreetly but ostentatiously withdrew conveying to his other partner
painful conviction that Fleming had borrowed a pan from a traveling
tinker whose negro wife was even now presenting a bill for the same
and demanding a settlement Relieved by his departure Fleming hurriedly
tore open the folded paper It was a letter written upon a leaf torn
out of an old account book whose ruled lines had undoubtedly given
his partners the idea that it was a bill Fleming hurriedly read the
following traced with a pencil in a schoolgirls hand


Mr J FLEMING

Dear SirAfter you went away that day I took that pan you brought back
to mix a batch of bread and biscuits The next morning at breakfast dad
says Whats gone o them thar biscuitsmy teeth is just broke with
themtheyre so grittytheyre abominable Whats this says he and
with that he chucks over to me two or three flakes of gold that was in
them You see what had happened Mr Fleming was this You had better
luck than you was knowing of It was this way Some of the gold you
washed had got slipped into the sides of the pan where it was broke
and the sticky dough must have brought it out and I kneaded them up
unbeknowing Of course I had to tell a wicked lie but Be ye all things
to all men says the Book and I thought you ought to know your good
luck and I send mammy with this and the gold in a little box Of
course if dad was a hunter of Mammon and not of Gods own beasts he
would have been mighty keen about finding where it came from but he
allows it was in the water in our near spring So goodby Do you care
for your ring now as much as you did

Yours very respectfully

KATINKA JALLINGER


As Mr Fleming glanced up from the paper mammy put a small cardboard
box in his hand For an instant he hesitated to open it not knowing how
far mammy was intrusted with the secret To his great relief she said
briskly Well dar now dat jobs done gone and often my hans I allow
to quit and jest get off dis yer camp afo ye kin shake a stick So
dont tell me nuffin I aint gotter tell when I goes back

Fleming understood You can tell her I thank herandIll attend to
it he said vaguely that isI

Hold dar thats just enuff honeyno mo So long to ye and youse
folks

He watched her striding away toward the main road and then opened the
box

It contained three flakes of placer or surface gold weighing in all
about a quarter of an ounce They could easily have slipped into the
interstices of the broken pan and not have been observed by him If this
was the result of the washing of a single panand he could now easily
imagine that other flakes might have escapedwhatBut he stopped
dazed and bewildered at the bare suggestion He gazed upon the vanishing
figure of mammy Could shecould Katinkahave the least suspicion of
the possibilities of this discovery Or had Providence put the keeping
of this secret into the hands of those who least understood its
importance For an instant he thought of running after her with a
word of caution but on reflection he saw that this might awaken her
suspicion and precipitate a discovery by another

His only safety for the present was silence until he could repeat his
experiment And that must be done quickly

How should he get away without his partners knowledge of his purpose
He was too loyal to them to wish to keep this good fortune to himself
but he was not yet sure of his good fortune It might be only a little
pocket which he had just emptied it might be a larger one which
another trial would exhaust

He had put up no notice he might find it already in possession of
Katinkas father or any chance prospector like himself In either case
he would be covered with ridicule by his partners and the camp or more
seriously rebuked for his carelessness and stupidity No he could not
tell them the truth nor could he lie He would say he was called away
for a day on private business

Luckily for him the active imagination of his partners was even now
helping him The theory of the tinker and the pan was indignantly
rejected by his other partner His blushes and embarrassment were
suddenly remembered by Faulkner and by the time he reached his cabin
they had settled that the negro woman had brought him a love letter He
was young and good looking what was more natural than that he should
have some distant love affair

His embarrassed statement that he must leave early the next morning
on business that he could not at PRESENT disclose was considered amply
confirmatory and received with maliciously significant acquiescence
Only said Faulkner at YOUR age sonnyhe was nine months older
than FlemingI should have gone TONIGHT Surely Providence was
favoring him

He was off early the next morning He was sorely tempted to go first to
the cabin but every moment was precious until he had tested the proof
of his good fortune

It was high noon before he reached the fringe of forest A few paces
farther and he found the spring and outcrop To avert his partners
suspicions he had not brought his own implements but had borrowed a
pan spade and pick from a neighbors claim before setting out The
spot was apparently in the same condition as when he left it and with
a beating heart he at once set to work an easy task with his new
implements He nervously watched the water overflow the pan of dirt
at its edges until emptied of earth and gravel the black sand alone
covered the bottom A slight premonition of disappointment followed
a rich indication would have shown itself before this A few more
workings and the pan was quite empty except for a few pinpoints of
color almost exactly the quantity he found before He washed another
pan with the same result Another taken from a different level of the
outcrop yielded neither more nor less There was no mistake it was
a failure His discovery had been only a little pocket and the few
flakes she had sent him were the first and last of that discovery

He sat down with a sense of relief he could face his partners again
without disloyalty he could see that pretty little figure once more
without the compunction of having incurred her fathers prejudices by
locating a permanent claim so near his cabin In fact he could carry
out his partners fancy to the letter

He quickly heaped his implements together and turned to leave the wood
but he was confronted by a figure that at first he scarcely recognized
Yetit was Katinka the young girl of the cabin who had sent him the
gold She was dressed differentlyperhaps in her ordinary everyday
garmentsa bright sprigged muslin a chip hat with blue ribbons set
upon a coil of luxurious brown hair But what struck him most was that
the girlish and diminutive character of the figure had vanished with
her illfitting clothes the girl that stood before him was of ordinary
height and of a prettiness and grace of figure that he felt would
have attracted anywhere Fleming felt himself suddenly embarrasseda
feeling that was not lessened when he noticed that her pretty lip was
compressed and her eyebrows a little straightened as she gazed at him

Ye made a bee line for the woods I see she said coldly I allowed
ye might have been droppin in to our house first

So I should said Fleming quickly but I thought I ought to first
make sure of the information you took the trouble to send me He
hesitated to speak of the ill luck he had just experienced he could
laugh at it himselfbut would she

And ye got a new pan she said half poutingly

Here seemed his opportunity Yes but Im afraid it hasnt the magic
of yours I havent even got the color I believe you bewitched your old
pan

Her face flushed a little and brightened and her lip relaxed with a
smile Go long with yer Ye dont mean to say ye had no luck today

Nonebut in seeing you

Her eyes sparkled Ye see I said all long ye werent much o a miner
Ye aint got no faith Ef ye had as much as a grain o mustard seed
yed remove mountains its in the Book

Yes and this mountain is on the bedrock and my faith is not strong
enough he said laughingly And then that would be having faith in
Mammon and you dont want me to have THAT

She looked at him curiously I jest reckon ye dont care a picayune
whether ye strike anything or not she said half admiringly

To please you Ill try again if youll look on Perhaps youll bring
me luck as you did before You shall take the pan I will fill it and
you shall wash it out Youll be my MASCOT

She stiffened a little at this and then said pertly Wots that

My good fairy

She smiled again this time with a new color in her pale face Maybe I
am she said with sudden gravity

He quickly filled the pan again with soil brought it to the spring
and first washed out the greater bulk of loose soil Now come here and
kneel down beside me he said and take the pan and do as I show you

She knelt down obediently Suddenly she lifted her little hand with a
gesture of warning Wait a minitjest a minittill the water runs
clear again

The pool had become slightly discolored from the first washing

That makes no difference he said quickly

Ah but wait please She laid her brown hand upon his arm a pleasant
warmth seemed to follow her touch Then she said joyously Look down
there

Where he asked

Theredont ye see it

See what

You and me

He looked where she pointed The pool had settled resumed its
mirrorlike calm and reflected distinctly not only their two bending
faces but their two figures kneeling side by side Two tall redwoods
rose on either side of them like the columns before an altar

There was a moment of silence The drone of a bumblebee near by seemed
to make the silence swim drowsily in their ears far off they heard the
faint beat of a woodpecker The suggestion of their kneeling figures in
this magic mirror was vague unreasoning yet for the moment none the
less irresistible His arm instinctively crept around her little waist
as he whisperedhe scarce knew what he saidPerhaps here is the
treasure I am seeking

The girl laughed released herself and sprang up the pan sank
ingloriously to the bottom of the pool where Fleming had to grope for
it assisted by Tinka who rolled up her sleeve to her elbow For a
minute or two they washed gravely but with no better success than
attended his own individual efforts The result in the bottom of the pan
was the same Fleming laughed

You see he said gayly the Mammon of unrighteousness is not for
meat least so near your fathers tabernacle

That makes no difference now said the girl quickly for dad is goin
to move anyway farther up the mountains He says its gettin too
crowded for him herewhen the last settler took up a section three
miles off

And are YOU going too asked the young man earnestly

Tinka nodded her brown head Fleming heaved a genuine sigh Well Ill
try my hand here a little longer Ill put up a notice of claim I dont
suppose your father would object You know he couldnt LEGALLY

I reckon ye might do it ef ye wantedef ye was THAT keen on gettin
gold said Tinka looking away There was something in the girls tone
which this budding lover resented He had become sensitive

Oh well he said I see that it might make unpleasantness with your
father I only thought he went on with tenderer tentativeness that
it would be pleasant to work here near you

Yed be only wastin yer time she said darkly

Fleming rose gravely Perhaps youre right he answered sadly and a
little bitterly and Ill go at once

He walked to the spring and gathered up his tools Thank you again for
your kindness and goodby

He held out his hand which she took passively and he moved away

But he had not gone far before she called him He turned to find her
still standing where he had left her her little hands clinched at her
side and her widely opened eyes staring at him Suddenly she ran
at him and catching the lapels of his coat in both hands held him
rigidly fast

No no ye shant goye mustnt go she said with hysterical
intensity I want to tell ye something ListenyouyouMr Fleming
Ive been a wicked wicked girl Ive told lies to dadto mammyto
YOU Ive borne false witnessIm worse than SapphiraIve acted a
big lie Oh Mr Fleming Ive made you come back here for nothing
Ye didnt find no gold the other day There wasnt any It was all me
IISALTED THAT PAN

Salted it echoed Fleming in amazement

Yes salted it she faltered thats what dad says they call
itwhat those wicked sons of Mammon do to their claims to sell them
Iput gold in the pan myself it wasnt there before

But why gasped Fleming

She stopped Then suddenly the fountains in the deep of her blue eyes
were broken up she burst into a sob and buried her head in her hands
and her hands on his shoulder Becausebecauseshe sobbed against
himI WANTED YOU to come back

He folded her in his arms He kissed her lovingly forgivingly
gratefully tearfully smilinglyand paused then he kissed her
sympathetically understandingly apologetically explanatorily in lieu
of other conversation Then becoming coherent he asked

But WHERE did you get the gold

Oh she said between fitful and despairing sobs somewhereI dont
knowout of the old Runlong agowhen I was little I didnt never
dare say anything to dadhed have been crazy mad at his own daughter
digginand I never cared nor thought a single bit about it until I saw
you

And you have never been there since

Never

Nor anybody else

No

Suddenly she threw back her head her chip hat fell back from her
face rosy with a dawning inspiration Oh say Jackyou dont
think thatafter all this timethere mightShe did not finish the
sentence but grasping his hand cried Come

She caught up the pan he seized the shovel and pick and they raced
like boy and girl down the hill When within a few hundred feet of the
house she turned at right angles into the clearing and saying Dont
be skeered dads away ran boldly on still holding his hand along
the little valley At its farther extremity they came to the Run a
halfdried watercourse whose rocky sides were marked by the erosion of
winter torrents It was apparently as wild and secluded as the forest
spring Nobody ever came here said the girl hurriedly after dad
sunk the well at the house

One or two pools still remained in the Run from the last seasons flow
water enough to wash out several pans of dirt

Selecting a spot where the white quartz was visible Fleming attacked
the bank with the pick After one or two blows it began to yield and
crumble away at his feet He washed out a panful perfunctorily more
intent on the girl than his work she eager alert and breathless
had changed places with him and become the anxious prospector But the
result was the same He threw away the pan with a laugh to take her
little hand But she whispered Try again

He attacked the bank once more with such energy that a great part of
it caved and fell filling the pan and even burying the shovel in the
debris He unearthed the latter while Tinka was struggling to get out
the pan

The mean thing is stuck and wont move she said pettishly I think
its broken now too just like ours

Fleming came laughingly forward and putting one arm around the girls
waist attempted to assist her with the other The pan was immovable
and indeed seemed to be broken and bent Suddenly he uttered an
exclamation and began hurriedly to brush away the dirt and throw the
soil out of the pan

In another moment he had revealed a fragment of decomposed quartz like
discolored honeycombed cheese half filling the pan But on its side
where the pick had struck it glancingly there was a yellow streak
like a ray of sunshine And as he strove to lift it he felt in that
unmistakable omnipotency of weight that it was seamed and celled with
gold


The news of Mr Flemings engagement two weeks later to the daughter
of the recluse religious hunter who had made a big strike at Lone Run
excited some skeptical discussion even among the honest congratulations
of his partners

Thats a mighty queer story how Jack got that girl sweet on him just by
borrowin a prospectin pan of her said Faulkner between the whiffs
of his pipe under the trees You and me might have borrowed a hundred
prospectin pans and never got even a drink thrown in Then to think
of that old preachin coonhunter hevin to give in and pass his strike
over to his daughters feller jest because he had scruples about gold
diggin himself Hed hev booted you and me outer his ranch first

Lord ye aint takin no stock in that hogwash responded the other
Why everybody knows old man Jallinger pretended to be sick o miners
and minin camps and couldnt bear to hev em near him only jest
because he himself was all the while secretly prospectin the whole lode
and didnt want no interlopers It was only when Fleming nippled in by
gettin hold o the girl that Jallinger knew the secret was out and
thats the way he bought him off Why Jack wasnt no minernever
wasye could see that HE never struck anything The only treasure he
found in the woods was Tinka Jallinger




A BELLE OF CANADA CITY


Cissy was tying her hat under her round chin before a small glass at
her window The window gave upon a background of serrated mountain and
oliveshadowed canyon with a faint additional outline of a higher snow
levelthe only dreamy suggestion of the whole landscape The foreground
was a glaringly fresh and unpicturesque mining town whose irregular
attempts at regularity were set forth with all the cruel uncompromising
clearness of the Californian atmosphere There was the straight Main
Street with its new brick block of stores ending abruptly against a
tangled bluff there was the ruthless clearing in the sedate pines where
the hideous spire of the new church imitated the soaring of the solemn
shafts it had displaced with almost irreligious mockery Yet this
foreground was Cissys worldher life her sole girlish experience She
did not however bother her pretty head with the view just then but
moved her cheek up and down before the glass the better to examine
by the merciless glare of the sunlight a few freckles that starred the
hollows of her temples Like others of her sex she was a poor critic
of what was her real beauty and quarreled with that peculiar texture of
her healthy skin which made her face as eloquent in her sunkissed cheek
as in her bright eyes and expression Nevertheless she was somewhat
consoled by the ravishing effect of the bowknot she had just tied and
turned away not wholly dissatisfied Indeed as the acknowledged belle
of Canada City and the daughter of its principal banker small wonder
that a certain frank vanity and childlike imperiousness were among her
faultsand her attractions

She bounded down the stairs and into the front parlor for their house
possessed the unheardof luxury of a double drawingroom albeit the
second apartment contained a desk and was occasionally used by Cissys
father in private business interviews with anxious seekers of advances
who shunned the publicity of the bank Here she instantly flew into the
arms of her bosom friend Miss Piney Tibbs a girl only a shade or two
less pretty than herself who always more or less ill at ease in these
splendors was awaiting her impatiently For Miss Tibbs was merely the
daughter of the hotelkeeper and although Tibbs was a Southerner and
had owned his own niggers in the States she was of inferior position
and a protegee of Cissys

Thank goodness youve come exclaimed Miss Tibbs for Ive bin
sittin here till I nigh took root What kep ye

How does it look responded Cissy as a relevant reply

The it referred to Cissys new hat and to the young girl the
coherence was perfectly plain Miss Tibbs looked at it severely It
would not do for a protegee to be too complaisant

Hem Must have cost a heap o money

It did Came from the best milliner in San Francisco

Of course said Piney with half assumed envy When your popper runs
the bank and just wallows in gold

Never mind dear replied Cissy cheerfully Soll YOUR popper some
day Im goin to get mine to let YOUR popper into somethingDitch
stocks and such Yes True O King Popperll do anything for me she
added a little loftily

Loyal as Piney was to her friend she was by no means convinced of
this She knew the difference between the two men and had a vivid
recollection of hearing her own father express his opinion of Cissys
respected parent as a Gold Shark and Quartz Miner Crusher It did
not however affect her friendship for Cissy She only said Lets
come caught Cissy around the waist pranced with her out into the
veranda and gasped out of breath Where are we goin first

Down Main Street said Cissy promptly

And lets stop at Markhams store Theyve got some new things in from
Sacramento added Piney

Country styles returned Cissy with a supercilious air No Besides
Markhams head clerk is gettin too presumptuous Just guess He asked
me while I was buyin something if I enjoyed the dance last Monday

But you danced with him said the simple Piney in astonishment

But not in his store among his customers said Cissy sapiently No
were going down Main Street past Secamps Those Secamp girls are
sure to be at their windows looking out This hat will just turn em
greengreener than ever

Youre just horrid Ciss said Piney with admiration

And then continued Cissy well just sail down past the new block to
the parsons and make a call

Oh I see said Piney archly Itll be just about the time when the
new engineer of the mill works has a clean shirt on and is smoking his
cigyar before the office

Cissy tossed her hat disdainfully Much anybody cares whether hes
there or not I havent forgotten how he showed us over the mill the
other day in a pair of overalls just like a workman

But they say hes awfully smart and well educated and neednt work
and Im sure its very nice of him to dress just like the other men when
hes with em urged Piney

Bah That was just to show that he didnt care what we thought of him
hes that conceited And it wasnt respectful considering one of the
directors was there all dressed up Dont tell me You can see it in
his eye looking you over without blinking and then turning away as if
hed got enough of you He makes me tired

Piney did not reply The engineer had seemed to her to be a singularly
attractive young man yet she was equally impressed with Cissys
superior condition which could find flaws in such perfection Following
her friend down the steps of the veranda they passed into the staring
graveled walk of the new garden only recently recovered from the wild
wood its accurate diamond and heart shaped beds of vivid green set
in white quartz borders giving it the appearance of elaborately iced
confectionery A few steps further brought them to the road and the
wooden sidewalk to Main Street which carried civic improvements
to the hillside and Mr Trixits very door Turning down this
thoroughfare they stopped laughing and otherwise assumed a conscious
half artificial air for it was the hour when Canada City lounged
listlessly before its shops its saloons its offices and mills or even
held lazy meetings in the dust of the roadway and the passage down the
principal street of its two prettiest girls was an event to be viewed as
if it were a civic procession Hats flew off as they passed place was
freely given impeding barrels and sacks were removed from the wooden
pavement and preoccupied indwellers hastily summoned to the front door
to do homage to Cissy Trixit and Piney as they went by Not but that
Canada City in the fierce and unregenerate days of its youth had
seen fairer and higher colored faces more gayly bedizened on its
thoroughfares but never anything so fresh and innocent Men stood
there all unconsciously reverencing their absent mothers sisters and
daughters in their spontaneous homage to the pair and seemed to feel
the wholesome breath of their Eastern homes wafted from the freshly
ironed skirts of these foolish virgins as they rustled by I am afraid
that neither Cissy nor Piney appreciated this feeling few women did at
that time indeed these young ladies assumed a slight air of hauteur

Really they do stare so said Cissy with eyes dilating with
pleasurable emotion well have to take the back street next time

Piney proud in the glory reflected from Cissy and in her own
answered We willsure

There was only one interruption to this triumphal progress and that was
so slight as to be noticed by only one of the two girls As they passed
the new works at the mill the new engineer as Piney had foreseen was
leaning against the doorpost smoking a pipe He took his hat from his
head and his pipe from his month as they approached and greeted them
with an easy Goodafternoon yet with a glance that was quietly
observant and tolerantly critical

There said Cissy when they had passed didnt I tell you Did you
ever see such conceit in your born days I hope you did not look at
him

Piney conscious of having done so and of having blushed under his
scrutiny nevertheless stoutly asserted that she had merely looked at
him to see who it was But Cissy was placated by passing the Secamps
cottage from whose window the three strapping daughters of John
Secamp lately an emigrant from Missouri were as Cissy had surmised
lightening the household duties by gazing at theto themunwonted
wonders of the street Whether their complexions still bearing traces
of the alkali dust and inefficient nourishment of the plains took a
more yellow tone from the spectacle of Cissys hat I cannot say Cissy
thought they did perhaps Piney was nearer the truth when she suggested
that they were only looking to enable them to make a homemade copy of
the hat next week

Their progress forward and through the outskirts of the town was of
the same triumphal character Teamsters withheld their oaths and their
uplifted whips as the two girls passed by weary miners toiling in
ditches looked up with a pleasure that was half reminiscent of their
past younger skylarkers stopped in their horseplay with half smiling
half apologetic faces more ambitious riders on the highway urged their
horses to greater speed under the girls inspiring eyes and Vaquero
Billy charging them full tilt brought up his mustang on its haunches
and rigid forelegs with a sweeping bow of his sombrero within a foot
of their artfully simulated terror In this way they at last reached the
clearing in the forest the church with its ostentatious spire and the
Reverend Mr Windibrooks dwelling otherwise humorously known as The
Pastorage where Cissy intended to call

The Reverend Mr Windibrook had been selected by his ecclesiastical
superiors to minister to the spiritual wants of Canada City as being
what was called a hearty man Certainly if considerable lung
capacity absence of reserve and power of handshaking and back slapping
were necessary to the redemption of Canada City Mr Windibrooks
ministration would have been successful But singularly enough the
rude miner was apt to resent this familiarity and it is recorded that
Isaac Wood otherwise known as Grizzly Woods once responded to a
cheerful back slap from the reverend gentleman by an ostentatiously
friendly hug which nearly dislocated the parsons ribs Perhaps Mr
Windibrook was more popular on account of his admiring enthusiasm of the
prosperous moneygetting members of his flock and a singular sympathy
with their methods and Mr Trixits daring speculations were an
especially delightful theme to him

Ah Miss Trixit he said as Cissy entered the little parlor and how
is your dear father Still startling the money market with his fearless
speculations This brother Jones turning to a visitor is the
daughter of our Napoleon of finance Montagu Trixit Only last week
in that deal in the Comstock he cleared fifty thousand dollars Yes
sir repeating it with unction fiftythousanddollarsin about
two hours and with a single stroke of the pen I believe I am
not overstating Miss Trixit he added appealing to Cissy with
a portentous politeness that was as badly fitting as his previous
heartiness

Cissy colored slightly I dont know she said simply She was
perfectly truthful She knew nothing of her fathers business except
the vague reputation of his success

Her modesty however produced a singular hilarity in Mr Windibrook
and a playful push YOU dont know Ha but I do Yes sirto the
visitorI have reason to remember it I called upon him the next day
I used sir the freedom of an old friend Trixit I said clapping
my hand on his shoulder the Lord has been good to you I congratulate
you

Hm he said without looking up What do you reckon those
congratulations are worth

Many a man sir who didnt know his style would have been staggered
But I knew my man I looked him straight in the eye A new organ I
said and as good a one as Sacramento can turn out

He took up a piece of paper scrawled a few lines on it to his cashier
and said Will that do Mr Windibrooks voice sank to a thrilling
whisper It was an order for one thousand dollars Fact sir THAT is
the father of this young lady

Ye had better luck than Bishop Briggs had with old Johnson the
Excelsior Bank president said the visitor encouraged by Windibrooks
heartiness into a humorous retrospect Briggs goes to him for a
subscription for a new fence round the buryingroundthe old one
havin rotted away Ye dont want no fence sez Johnson short like
No fence round a buryinground sez Briggs starin No Them as is
IN the buryinground cant get OUT and them as ISNT dont want to
get IN nohow So you kin just travelI aint givin money away on
uselessnesses Ha ha

A chill silence followed which checked even Pineys giggle Mr
Windibrook evidently had no heartiness for nonsubscribing
humor There are those who can jest with sacred subjects he said
ponderously but I have always found Mr Trixit though blunt
eminently practical Your father is still away he added shifting the
conversation to Cissy hovering wherever he can extract the honey to
store up for the provision of age An industrious worker

Hes still away said Cissy feeling herself on safe ground though
she was not aware of her fathers entomological habits In San
Francisco I think

She was glad to get away from Mr Windibrooks heartiness and console
herself with Mrs Windibrooks constitutional depression which was
partly the result of nervous dyspepsia and her husbands boisterous
cordiality I suppose dear you are dreadfully anxious about your
father when he is away from home she said to Cissy with a sympathetic
sigh

Cissy conscious of never having felt a moments anxiety and accustomed
to his absences replied naively Why

Oh responded Mrs Windibrook on account of his great business
responsibilities you know so much depends upon him

Again Cissy did not comprehend she could not understand why this
masterful man her father who was equal to her own and it seemed
everybodys needs had any responsibility or was not as infallible
and constant as the sunshine or the air she breathed Without being his
confidante or even his associate she had since her mothers death no
other experience youthfully alive to the importance of their wealth it
seemed to her however only a natural result of being HIS daughter She
smiled vaguely and a little impatiently They might have talked to
her about HERSELF it was a little tiresome to always have to answer
questions about her popper Nevertheless she availed herself of
Mrs Windibrooks invitation to go into the garden and see the new
summerhouse that had been put up among the pines and gradually diverted
her hostesss conversation into gossip of the town If it was somewhat
lugubrious and hesitating it was however a relief to Cissy and
bearing chiefly upon the vicissitudes of others gave her the comforting
glow of comparison

Touching the complexion of the Secamp girls Mrs Windibrook attributed
it to their great privations in the alkali desert One day continued
Mrs Windibrook when their father was ill with fever and ague they
drove the cattle twenty miles to water through that dreadful poisonous
dust and when they got there their lips were cracked and bleeding and
their eyelids like burning knives and Mamie Secamps hair which used
to be a beautiful brown like your own my dear was bleached into a
rusty yellow

And they WILL wear colors that dont suit them said Cissy
impatiently

Never mind dear said Mrs Windibrook ambiguously I suppose they
will have their reward

Nor was the young engineer discussed in a lighter vein It pains me
dreadfully to see that young man working with the common laborers and
giving himself no rest just because he says he wants to know exactly
how the thing is done and why the old works failed she remarked
sadly When Mr Windibrook knew he was the son of Judge Masterton and
had rich relations he wished of course to be civil but somehow young
Masterton and he didnt hit off Indeed Mr Windibrook was told that
he had declared that the prosperity of Canada City was only a mushroom
growth and it seems too shocking to repeat dear but they say he said
that the new churchOUR churchwas simply using the Almighty as a big
bluff to the other towns Of course Mr Windibrook couldnt see him
after that Why he even said your father ought to send you to school
somewhere and not let you grow up in this half civilized place

Strangely enough Cissy did not hail this corroboration of her dislike
to young Masterton with the liveliness one might have expected Perhaps
it was because Piney Tibbs was no longer present having left Cissy at
the parsonage and returned home Still she enjoyed her visit after a
fashion romped with the younger Windibrooks and climbed a tree in
the security of her sylvan seclusion and the promptings of her still
healthy girlish blood and only came back to cake and tea and her
new hat which she had prudently hung up in the summerhouse as the
afternoon was waning When they returned to the house they found that
Mr Windibrook had gone out with his visitor and Cissy was spared the
advertisement of a boisterous escort home which he generally insisted
upon She gayly took leave of the infant Windibrook and his mother
sallied out into the empty road and once more became conscious of her
new hat

The shadows were already lengthening and a cool breeze stirred the deep
aisles of the pines on either side of the highway One or two
people passed her hurriedly talking and gesticulating evidently so
preoccupied that they did not notice her Again a rapid horseman rode
by without glancing round overtook the pedestrians exchanged a few
hurried words with them and then spurred swiftly away as one of them
shouted after him Theres another dispatch confirming it A group
of men talking by the roadside failed to look up as she passed Cissy
pouted slightly at this want of taste which made some late election
news or the report of a horse race more enthralling than her new hat and
its owner Even the toilers in the ditches had left their work and were
congregated around a man who was reading aloud from a widely margined
extra of the Canada City Press It seemed provoking as she knew
her cheeks were glowing from her romp and was conscious that she was
looking her best However the Secamps cottage was just before her and
the girls were sure to be on the lookout She shook out her skirts and
straightened her pretty little figure as she approached the house But
to her surprise her coming had evidently been anticipated by them
and they were actuallyand unexpectedlyawaiting her behind the low
whitewashed garden palings As she neared them they burst into a
shrill discordant laugh so full of irony gratified malice and mean
exaltation that Cissy was for a moment startled But only for a moment
she had her fathers reckless audacity and bore them down with a
display of such pink cheeks and flashing eyes that their laughter was
checked and they remained openmouthed as she swept by them

Perhaps this incident prevented her from noticing another but more
passive one A group of men standing before the new millthe same
men who had so solicitously challenged her attention with their bows a
couple of hours agoturned as she approached and suddenly dispersed It
was not until this was repeated by another group that its oddity forced
itself upon her still angry consciousness Then the street seemed to
be full of those excited preoccupied groups who melted away as she
advanced Only one man met her curious eyesthe engineeryet she
missed the usual critical smile with which he was wont to greet her
and he gave her a bow of such profound respect and gravity that for the
first time she felt really uneasy Was there something wrong with her
hat That dreadful fateful hat Was it too conspicuous Did he think
it was vulgar She was eager to cross the street on the next block where
there were large plateglass windows which she and Pineyif Piney were
only with her nowhad often used as mirrors

But there was a great crowd on the next block congregated around the
bankher fathers bank A vague terror she knew not what now began
to creep over her She would have turned into a side street but mingled
with her fear was a resolution not to show itnot to even THINK of
itto combat it as she had combated the horrid laugh of the Secamp
girls and she kept her way with a beating heart but erect head without
looking across the street

There was another crowd before the newspaper officealso on the other
sideand a bulletin board but she would not try to read it Only one
idea was in her mindto reach home before any one should speak to her
for the last intelligible sound that had reached her was the laugh of
the Secamp girls and this was still ringing in her ears seeming to
voice the hidden strangeness of all she saw and stirring her as that
had with childish indignation She kept on with unmoved face however
and at last turned into the planked sideterracea part of her
fathers munificenceand reached the symmetrical gardenbeds and
graveled walk She ran up the steps of the veranda and entered the
drawingroom through the open French window Glancing around the
familiar room at her fathers closed desk at the open piano with the
piece of music she had been practicing that morning the whole walk
seemed only a foolish dream that had frightened her She was Cissy
Trixit the daughter of the richest man in the town This was her
fathers house the wonder of Canada City

A ring at the front doorbell startled her without waiting for the
servant to answer it she stepped out on the veranda and saw a boy whom
she recognized as a waiter at the hotel kept by Pineys father He
was holding a note in his hand and staring intently at the house and
garden Seeing Cissy he transferred his stare to her Snatching the
note from him she tore it open and read in Pineys wellknown scrawl
Dad wont let me come to you now dear but Ill try to slip out late
tonight Why should she want to come She had said nothing about
coming NOWand why should her father prevent her Cissy crushed the
note between her fingers and faced the boy

What are you staring atidiot

The boy grinned hysterically a little frightened at Cissys
straightened brows and snapping eyes

Get away theres no answer

The boy ran off and Cissy returned to the drawingroom Then it
occurred to her that the servant had not answered the bell She rang
again furiously There was no response She called down the basement
staircase and heard only the echo of her voice in the depths How still
the house was Were they ALL outSusan Norah the cook the Chinaman
and the gardener She ran down into the kitchen the back door was open
the fires were burning dishes were upon the table but the kitchen was
empty Upon the floor lay a damp copy of the extra She picked it
up quickly Several black headlines stared her in the face Enormous
Defalcation Montagu Trixit Absconded 50000 Dollars Missing Run
on the Bank

She threw the paper through the open door as she would have hurled back
the accusation from living lips Then in a revulsion of feeling lest
any one should find her there she ran upstairs and locked herself in
her own room

So that was what it all meant Allfrom the laugh of the Secamp girls
to the turning away of the townspeople as she went by Her father was a
thief who had stolen money from the bank and run away leaving her alone
to bear it No It was all a liea wicked jealous lie A foolish lie
for how could he steal money from HIS OWN bank Cissy knew very little
of her fatherperhaps that was why she believed in him she knew still
less of business but she knew that HE did She had often heard them
say itperhaps the very ones who now called him names He who had made
Canada City what it was HE who Windibrook said only today had
like Moses touched the rocks of the Canada with his magic wand of
Finance and streams of public credit and prosperity had gushed from
it She would never speak to them again She would shut herself up here
dismiss all the servants but the Chinaman and wait until her father
returned

There was a knock and the entreating voice of Norah the cook outside
the door Cissy unlocked it and flung it open indignantly

Ah Its yourself missand I never knew ye kem back till I met that
gossoon of a hotel waiter in the street said the panting servant
Sure it was only an hour ago while I was at me woorrck in the kitchen
and Jim rushes in and sez For the love of God if iver ye want to see
a blessed cint of the money ye put in the masthers bank off wid ye now
and draw it outfor theres a run on the bank

It was an infamous lie said Cissy fiercely

Sure miss how was oi to know And if the masther HAS gone away its
ownly takin me money from the other divils down there thats drawin it
out and dividin it betwixt and between them

Cissy had a very vague idea of what a run on the bank meant but
Norahs logic seemed to satisfy her feminine reason She softened a
little

Mr Windibrook is in the parlor miss and a jintleman on the veranda
continued Norah encouraged

Cissy started Ill come down she said briefly

Mr Windibrook was waiting beside the piano with his soft hat in one
hand and a large white handkerchief in the other He had confidently
expected to find Cissy in tears and was ready with boisterous
condolement but was a little taken aback as the young girl entered
with a pale face straightened brows and eyes that shone with audacious
rebellion However it was too late to change his attitude Ah my
young friend he said a little awkwardly we must not give way to our
emotions but try to recognize in our trials the benefits of a great
lesson But he added hurriedly seeing her stand still silent but
erect before him I see that you do He paused coughed slightly cast
a glance at the verandawhere Cissy now for the first time observed
a man standing in an obviously assumed attitude of negligent
abstractionmoved towards the back room and in a lower voice said A
word with you in private

Without replying Cissy followed him

If said Mr Windibrook with a sickly smile you are questioned
regarding your fathers affairs you may remember his peculiar and
utterly unsolicited gift of a certain sum towards a new organ to which
I alluded today You can say that he always expressed great liberality
towards the church and it was no surprise to you

Cissy only stared at him with dangerous eyes

Mrs Windibrook continued the reverend gentleman in his highest
heartiest voice albeit a little hurried wished me to say to you that
until you heard fromyour friendsshe wanted you to come and stay with
her DO come DO

Cissy with her bright eyes fixed upon her visitor said I shall stay
here

But said Mr Windibrook impatiently you cannot That man you see on
the veranda is the sheriffs officer The house and all that it contains
are in the hands of the law

Cissys face whitened in proportion as her eyes grew darker but she
said stoutly I shall stay here till my popper tells me to go

Till your popper tells you to go repeated Mr Windibrook harshly
dropping his heartiness and his handkerchief in a burst of unguarded
temper Your papa is a thief escaping from justice you foolish girl
a disgraced felon who dare not show his face again in Canada City and
you are lucky yes lucky miss if you do not share his disgrace

And youre a wicked wicked liar said Cissy clinching her little
fists at her side and edging towards him with a sidelong bantamlike
movement as she advanced her freckled cheek close to his with an
effrontery so like her absconding father that he recoiled before it
And a mean doublefaced hypocrite too Didnt you always praise him
Didnt you call him a Napoleon and aMoses Didnt you say he was
the making of Canada City Didnt you get him to raise your salary and
start a subscription for your new house Oh youyoustinking beast

Here the stranger on the veranda still gazing abstractedly at
the landscape gave a low and apparently unconscious murmur as if
enraptured with the view Mr Windibrook recalled to an attempt at
dignity took up his hat and handkerchief When you have remembered
yourself and your position Miss Trixit he said loftily the offer I
have made you

I despise it Id sooner stay in the woods with the grizzlies and
rattlesnakes said Cissy pantingly Go and leave me alone Do you
hear She stamped her little foot Are you listening Go

Mr Windibrook promptly retreated through the door and down the steps
into the garden at which the stranger on the veranda reluctantly tore
himself away from the landscape and slowly entered the parlor through
the open French window Here however he became equally absorbed and
abstracted in the condition of his beard carefully stroking his shaven
cheek and lips and pulling his goatee

After a pause he turned to the angry Cissy standing by the piano
radiant with glowing cheeks and flashing eyes and said slowly I
reckon you gave the parson as good as he sent It kinder settles a man
to hear the frozen truth about himself sometimes and youve helped old
Shadbelly considerably on the way towards salvation But he was right
about one thing Miss Trixit The house IS in the hands of the law Im
representing it as deputy sheriff Mebbe you might remember meJake
Poolewhen your father was addressing the last Citizens meeting
sittin next to him on the platformIM in possession It isnt a job
Im hankerin much arter Id a lief rather hunt hoss thieves or track
down road agents than this kind o fancy underhand work So youll
excuse me miss if I aint got the style He paused rubbed his chin
thoughtfully and then said slowly and with great deliberation Ef
theres any little thing here missany keepsakes or such trifles
ez you keer for in partickler things you wouldnt like strangers to
haveyou just make a little pile of em and drop em down somewhere
outside the back door There aint no inventory taken nor sealin up
of anythin done just yet though I have to see there aint anythin
disturbed But I kalkilate to walk out on that veranda for a spell
and look at the landscape He paused again and said with a sigh of
satisfaction Its a mighty pooty view out thar it just takes me every
time

As he turned and walked out through the French window Cissy did not
for a moment comprehend him then strangely enough his act of rude
courtesy for the first time awakened her to the full sense of the
situation This house her fathers house was no longer hers If her
father should NEVER return she wanted nothing from it NOTHING She
gripped her beating heart with the little hand she had clinched so
valiantly a moment ago Suddenly her hand dropped Some one had glided
noiselessly into the back room a figure in a blue blouse a Chinaman
their house servant Ah Fe He cast a furtive glance at the stranger on
the veranda and then beckoned to her stealthily She came towards him
wonderingly when he suddenly whipped a note from his sleeve and with
a dexterous movement slipped it into her fingers She tore it open A
single glance showed her a small key inclosed in a line of her fathers
handwriting Drawing quickly back into the corner she read as follows
If this reaches you in time take from the second drawer of my desk an
envelope marked Private Contracts and give it to the bearer There
was neither signature nor address

Putting her finger to her lips she cast a quick glance at the absorbed
figure on the veranda and stepped before the desk She fitted the key
to the drawer and opened it rapidly but noiselessly There lay
the envelope and among other ticketed papers a small roll of
greenbackssuch as her father often kept there It was HIS money she
did not scruple to take it with the envelope Handing the latter to
the Chinaman who made it instantly disappear up his sleeve like a
conjurers act she signed him to follow her into the hall

Who gave you that note Ah Fe she whispered breathlessly

Chinaman

Who gave it to him

Chinaman

And to HIM

Nollee Chinaman

Another Chinaman

Yesheap Chinamanallee same as gang

You mean it passed from one Chinamans hand to another

Allee same

Why didnt the first Chinaman who got it bring it here

Spose Mellikan man want to catchee lettel He spotty Chinaman He
follee Chinaman Chinaman passee lettel nex Chinaman He no get
Mellikan man no habe got Sabe

Then this package will go back the same way

Allee same

And who will YOU give it to now

Allee same man blingee me lettel Hop Liwho makee washee

An idea here struck Cissy which made her heart jump and her cheeks
flame Ah Fe gazed at her with an infantile smile of admiration

How far did that letter come she asked with eager questioning eyes

Lettee me see him said Ah Fe

Cissy handed him the missive he examined closely some halfadozen
Chinese characters that were scrawled along the length of the outer
fold and which she had innocently supposed were a part of the markings
of the rice paper on which the note was written

Heap Chinaman velly much walkeelongee way Spose you look He
pointed through the open front door to the prospect beyond It was a
familiar one to Cissythe long Canada the crest on crest of serried
pines and beyond the dim snowline Ah Fes brown finger seemed to
linger there

In the snow she whispered her cheek whitening like that dim line
but her eyes sparkling like the sunshine over it

Allee same John said Ah Fe plaintively

Ah Fe whispered Cissy take ME with you to Hop Li

No good said Ah Fe stolidly Hop Li he givee thishe indicated
the envelope in his sleeveto next Chinaman HE no go Spose you go
with me Hop Liyou no makee nothingallee same makee foolee

I know but you just take me there DO

The young girl was irresistible Ah Fes face relaxed Allee litee he
said with a resigned smile

You wait here a moment said Cissy brightening She flew up the
staircase In a few minutes she was back again She had exchanged her
smart rosesprigged chintz for a pathetic little bluechecked frock of
her schooldays the fateful hat had given way to a brown straw flat
bent like a frame around her charming face All the girlishness and
indeed a certain honest boyishness of her nature seemed to have come
out in her glowing freckled cheek brilliant audacious eyes and the
quick stride which brought her to Ah Fes side

Now lets go she said out the back way and down the side streets
She paused cast a glance through the drawingroom at the contemplative
figure of the sheriffs deputy on the veranda and then passed out of
the house forever



The excitement over the failure of Montagu Trixits bank did not burn
itself out until midnight By that time however it was pretty well
known that the amount of the defalcations had been exaggerated that
it had been preceded by the suspension of the Excelsior Bank of San
Francisco of which Trixit was also a managing director occasioned by
the discovery of the withdrawal of securities for use in the branch bank
at Canada City that he had fled the State eastward across the Sierras
yet that owing to the vigilance of the police on the frontier he had
failed to escape and was in hiding But there were adverse reports of a
more sinister nature It was said that others were implicated that they
dared not bring him to justice it was pointed out that there was more
concern among many who were not openly connected with the bank than
among its unfortunate depositors Besides the inevitable downfall of
those who had invested their fortunes in it there was distrust or
suspicion everywhere Even Trixits enemies were forced to admit the
saying that Canada City was the bank and the bank was Trixit

Perhaps this had something to do with an excited meeting of the
directors of the New Mill to whose discussions Dick Masterton the
engineer had been hurriedly summoned When the president told him that
he had been selected to undertake the difficult and delicate mission
of discovering the whereabouts of Montagu Trixit and if possible
procuring an interview with him he was amazed What had the New Mill
which had always kept itself aloof from the bank and its methods to
do with the disgraced manager He was still more astonished when the
president added bluntly

Trixit holds securities of ours for money advanced to the mill by
himself privately They do not appear on the books but if he chooses
to declare them as assets of the bank its a bad thing for us If he
is bold enough to keep them he may be willing to make some arrangement
with us to carry them on If he has got away or committed suicide as
some say its for you to find the whereabouts of the securities and get
them He is said to have been last seen near the Summit You understand
our position

Masterton did with suppressed disgust But he was young and there was
the thrill of adventure in this I will go he said quietly

We thought you would You must take the up stage tonight Come
again and get your final instructions By the way you might get some
information at Trixits house Youererare acquainted with his
daughter I think

Which makes it quite impossible for me to seek her for such a purpose
said Masterton coldly

A few hours later he was on the coach As they cleared the outskirts of
the town they passed two Chinamen plodding sturdily along in the dust
of the highway



Mr Masterton started from a slight doze in the heavy lumbering
mountain wagon which had taken the place of the smart Concord coach
that he had left at the last station The scenery too had changed the
four horses threaded their way through rocky defiles of stunted larches
and hardy brush with here and there open patches of shrunken snow
Yet at the edge of declivities he could still see through the rolledup
leather curtains the valley below bathed in autumn the glistening
rivers half spent with the long summer drought and the green slopes
rolling upward into crest after crest of ascending pines At times a
drifting haze always imperceptible from below veiled the view a chill
wind blew through the vehicle and made the steel sledgerunners that
hung beneath the wagon ready to be shipped under the useless wheels
an ominous provision A few rude stations half blacksmith shops half
grocery marked the deserted but wellworn road along narrow packers
wagon or a tortuous file of Chinamen carrying mysterious bundles
depending from bamboo poles was their rare and only company The rough
sheepskin jackets which these men wore over their characteristic blue
blouses and their heavy leggings were a new revelation to Masterton
accustomed to the thinly clad coolie of the mines They seemed a
distinct race

I never knew those chaps get so high up but they seem to understand
the cold he remarked

The driver looked up and ejaculated his disgust and his tobacco juice
at the same moment

I reckon theyre everywhar in Californy whar you want em and whar you
dont you take my word for it afore long Californy will hev to reckon
that she ginerally DONT want em ef a white man has to live here With
a race tied up together in a language ye cant understand ways that no
feller knowsfrom their prayin to devils swappin their wives and
havin their bones sent back to Chinywot are ye goin to do and
where are ye Wot are ye goin to make outer men that look so much alike
ye cant tell em apart that think alike and act alike and never in
ways that ye kin catch on to Fellers knotted together in some underhand
secret way o communicatin with each other so that ef ye kick a
Chinaman up here on the Summit another Chinaman will squeal in the
valley And the way they do it just gets me Look yer Ill tell ye
somethin that happened thats gospel truth Some of the boys that
reckoned to hev some fun with the Chinee gang over at Cedar Camp started
out one afternoon to raid em They groped along through the woods whar
nobody could see em kalkilatin to come down with a rush on the camp
over two miles away And nobody DID see em only ONE Chinaman wot they
met a mile from the camp burnin punk to his joss or devil and he
scooted away just in the contrary direction Well sir when they
waltzed into that camp darn my skin ef there was a Chinaman there or
as much as a grain of rice to grab Somebody had warned em Well this
sort o got the boys and they set about discoverin how it was done
One of em noticed that there was some of them bits of tissue paper
slips that they toss around at funerals lyin along the road near the
camp and another remembered that the Chinaman they met on the hill
tossed a lot of that paper in the air afore he scooted Well sir the
wind carried just enough of that paper straight down the hill into
that camp ten minutes afore THEY could get there to give them Chinamen
warninwhatever it was Fact Why Ive seen em stringin along the
road just like them fellers we passed just now and then stop all of a
suddent like hounds off the scent jabber among themselves and start
off in a different direction

Just what theyre doing now By thunder interrupted another
passenger who was looking through the rolledup curtain at his side

All the passengers turned by one accord and looked out The file of
Chinamen under observation had indeed turned and was even then moving
rapidly away at right angles from the road

Got some signal you bet said the driver some yeller paper or piece
o joss stick in the road What

The remark was addressed to the passenger who had just placed his finger
on his lip and indicated a stolidlooking Chinaman overlooked before
who was sitting in the back or steerage seat

Oh he be darned said the driver impatiently HE is no account hes
only the laundryman from Rocky Canyon Im talkin of the coolie gang

But here the conversation flagged and the air growing keener the flaps
of the leather side curtains were battened down Masterton gave himself
up to conflicting reflections The information that he had gathered
was meagre and unsatisfactory and he could only trust to luck and
circumstance to fulfill his mission The first glow of adventure having
passed he was uneasily conscious that the mission was not to his taste
The pretty flushed but defiant face of Cissy that afternoon haunted
him he had not known the immediate cause of it but made no doubt that
she had already heard the news of her fathers disgrace when he met
her He regretted now that he hadnt spoken to her if only a few formal
words of sympathy He had always been half tenderly amused at her frank
conceit and her airsthe innocent undisguised pride of the country
belle so different from the hard aplomb of the city girl And now the
foolish little moth dancing in the sunshine of prosperity had felt the
chill of winter in its pretty wings The contempt he had for the father
had hitherto shown itself in tolerant pity for the daughter so proud
of her fathers position and what it brought her In the revelation that
his own directors had availed themselves of that fathers methods and
the ignoble character of his present mission he felt a stirring of
selfreproach What would become of her Of course frivolous as she
was she would not feel the keenness of this misfortune like another
nor yet rise superior to it She would succumb for the present to
revive another season in a dimmer glory elsewhere His critical cynical
observation of her had determined that any filial affection she
might have would be merged and lost in the greater deprivation of her
position

A sudden darkening of the landscape below and a singular opaque
whitening of the air around them aroused him from his thoughts The
driver drew up the collar of his overcoat and laid his whip smartly over
the backs of his cattle The air grew gradually darker until suddenly
it seemed to disintegrate into invisible gritty particles that swept
through the wagon Presently these particles became heavier more
perceptible and polished like small shot and a keen wind drove them
stingingly into the faces of the passengers or insidiously into their
pockets collars or the folds of their clothes The snow forced itself
through the smallest crevice

Well get over this when once weve passed the bend the road seems to
dip beyond said Masterton cheerfully from his seat beside the driver

The driver gave him a single scornful look and turned to the passenger
who occupied the seat on the other side of him I dont like the look
o things down there but ef we are stuck well have to strike out for
the next station

But said Masterton as the wind volleyed the sharp snow pellets in
their faces and the leaders were scarcely distinguishable through the
smokelike discharges it cant be worse than here

The driver did not speak but the other passenger craned over his back
and said explanatorily

I reckon ye dont know these storms this kind o dry snow dont stick
and dont clog Look

Indeed between the volleys Masterton could see that the road was
perfectly bare and windswept and except slight drifts and banks beside
outlying bushes and shrubswhich even then were again blown away
before his eyesthe level landscape was unclothed and unchanged Where
these mysterious snow pellets went to puzzled and confused him they
seemed to vanish as they had appeared into the air about them

Id make a straight rush for the next station said the other
passenger confidently to the driver If were stuck were that much on
the way if we turn back now well have to take the grade anyway when
the storms over and neither you nor I know when THATll be It may be
only a squall just now but its gettin rather late in the season Just
pitch in and drive all ye know

The driver laid his lash on the horses and for a few moments the heavy
vehicle dashed forward in violent conflict with the storm At times the
elastic hickory framework of its domed leather roof swayed and bent like
the ribs of an umbrella at times it seemed as if it would be lifted
bodily off at times the whole interior of the vehicle was filled with a
thin smoke by drifts through every cranny But presently to Mastertons
great relief the interminable level seemed to end and between the
whitened blasts he could see that the road was descending Again the
horses were urged forward and at last he could feel that the vehicle
began to add the momentum of its descent to its conflict with the storm
The blasts grew less violent or became only the natural resistance of
the air to their dominant rush With the cessation of the snow volleys
and the clearing of the atmosphere the road became more strongly
defined as it plunged downward to a terrace on the mountain flank
several hundred feet below Presently they came again upon a thicker
growth of bushes and here and there a solitary fir The wind died away
the cold seemed to be less bitter Masterton in his relief glanced
smilingly at his companions on the box but the drivers mouth was
compressed as he urged his team forward and the other passenger looked
hardly less anxious They were now upon the level terrace and the storm
apparently spending its fury high up and behind them But in spite of
the clearing of the air he could not but notice that it was singularly
dark What was more singular the darkness seemed to have risen from
below and to flow in upon them as they descended A curtain of profound
obscurity darker even than the mountain wall at their side shut out
the horizon and the valley below But for the temperature Masterton
would have thought a thunderstorm was closing in upon them An odd
feeling of uneasiness crept over him

A few fitful gusts now came from the obscurity one of them was
accompanied by what seemed a flight of small startled birds crossing the
road ahead of them A second larger and more sustained flight showed his
astonished eyes that they were white and each bird an enormous flake
of SNOW For an instant the air was filled with these disks shreds
patchestwo or three clinging togetherlike the downfall shaken from
a tree striking the leather roof and sides with a dull thud spattering
the road into which they descended with large rosettes that melted away
only to be followed by hundreds more that stuck and STAYED In five
minutes the ground was white with it the long road gleaming out ahead
in the darkness the roof and sides of the wagon were overlaid with it
as with a coating of plaster of Paris the harness of the horses
and even the reins stood out over their steaming backs like white
trappings In five minutes more the steaming backs themselves were
blanketed with it the arms and legs of the outside passengers pinioned
to the seats with it and the arms of the driver kept free only by
incessant motion It was no longer snowing it was snowballing it
was an avalanche out of the slopes of the sky The exhausted horses
floundered in it the clogging wheels dragged in it the vehicle at last
plunged into a billow of itand stopped

The bewildered and half blinded passengers hurried out into the road
to assist the driver to unship the wheels and fit the steel runners
in their axles But it was too late By the time the heavy wagon was
converted into a sledge it was deeply imbedded in wet and clinging
snow The narrow longhandled shovels borrowed from the prospectors
kits were powerless before this heavy half liquid impediment At last
the driver with an oath relinquished the attempt and unhitching his
horses collected the passengers and led them forward by a narrower and
more sheltered trail toward the next stations now scarce a mile away
The led horses broke a path before them the snow fell less heavily
but it was nearly an hour before the straggling procession reached the
house and the snowcoated and exhausted passengers huddled and steamed
round the redhot stove in the barroom The driver had vanished with
his team into the shed Mastertons fellow passenger on the boxseat
after a few whispered words to the landlord also disappeared

I see youve got Jake Poole with you said one of the barroom
loungers to Masterton indicating the passenger who had just left I
reckon hes here on the same fool business

Masterton looked his surprise and mystification

Jake Poole the deputy sheriff repeated the other I reckon hes
here pretendin to hunt for Montagu Trixit like the San Francisco
detectives that kem up yesterday

Masterton with difficulty repressed a start He had heard of Poole but
did not know him by sight I dont think I understand he said coolly

I reckon youre a stranger in these parts returned the lounger
looking at Masterton curiously Ef you warnt yed know that about the
last man San Francisco or Canada City WANTED to ketch is Monty Trixit
He knows too much and THEY know it But theyve got to keep up a show
chasea kind o cirkisridinup here to satisfy the stockholders You
bet that Jake Poole hez got his ordersthey might kill him to shut his
mouth ef they got an excuseand he made a fightbut he aint no such
fool No sir Why the sickest man you ever saw was that director that
kem up here with a detective when he found that Monty HADNT left the
State

Then he IS hiding about here said Masterton with assumed calmness

The man paused lowered his voice and said I wouldnt swear he wasnt
a mile from whar were talkin now Why they do allow that hes taken a
drink at this very bar SINCE the news cameand that thars a hoss kept
handy in the stable already saddled just to tempt him ef he was inclined
to scoot

Thats only a bluff to start him goin so that they kin shoot him in
his tracks said a bystander

That aint no good ef he has as they SAY he has papers stowed away
with a friend that would frighten some mighty partickler men out o
their boots returned the first speaker But hes got his spies too
and thar aint a man that crosses the Divide as aint spotted by them
The officers brag about havin put a cordon around the district and yet
theyve just found out that he managed to send a telegraphic dispatch
from Black Rock station right under their noses Why only an hour or
so arter the detectives and the news arrived here thar kem along one o
them emigrant teams from Pike and the driver said that a smartlookin
chap in storeclothes had come out of an old prospectors cabin up
thar on the rise about a mile away and asked for a newspaper And the
description the teamster gave just fitted Trixit to a T Well the
information was give so public like that the detectives HAD to make a
rush over thar and bgosh although thar wasnt a soul passed them
but a file of Chinese coolies when they got thar they found
NOTHINnothin but them Chinamen cookin their rice by the roadside

Masterton smiled carelessly and walked to the window as if intent upon
the still falling snow But he had at once grasped the situation that
seemed now almost providential for his inexperience and his mission The
man he was seeking was within his possible reach if the story he had
heard was true The detectives would not be likely to interfere with his
plans for he was the only man who really wished to meet the fugitive
The presence of Poole made him uneasy though he had never met the man
before Was it barely possible that he was on the same mission on behalf
of others IF what he heard was true there might be others equally
involved with the absconding manager But then the spieshow could the
deputy sheriff elude them and how could HE

He was turning impatiently away from the window when his eye caught
sight of a straggling file of Chinamen breasting the storm on their way
up the hill A sudden idea seized him Perhaps THEY were the spies in
question He remembered the drivers story A sudden flash of intuition
made him now understand the singular way the file of coolies which
they met had diverted their course after passing the wagon They had
recognized the deputy on the box Staythere was another Chinaman in
the coach HE might have given them the signal He glanced hurriedly
around the room for him he was gone Perhaps he had already joined the
file he had just seen His only hope was to follow thembut how and
how to do it quietly The afternoon was waning it would be three or
four hours before the down coach would arrive from which the driver
expected assistance Now if ever was his opportunity

He made his way through the back door and found himself among the straw
and chips of the stableyard and woodshed Still uncertain what to do
he mechanically passed before the long shed which served as temporary
stalls for the steaming wagon horses At the further end to his
surprise was a tethered mustang ready saddled and bridledthe
opportune horse left for the fugitive according to the loungers story
Masterton cast a quick glance around the stable it was deserted by all
save the feeding animals

He was new to adventures of this kind or he would probably have weighed
the possibilities and consequences He was ordinarily a thoughtful
reflective man but like most men of intellect he was also imaginative
and superstitious and this crowning accident of the providential
situation in which he found himself was superior to his logic There
would also be a grim irony in his taking this horse for such a purpose
He again looked and listened There was no one within sight or hearing
He untied the rope from the bitring leaped into the saddle and
emerged cautiously from the shed The wet snow muffled the sound of the
horses hoofs Moving round to the rear of the stable so as to bring it
between himself and the station he clapped his heels into the mustangs
flanks and dashed into the open

At first he was confused and bewildered by the half hidden boulders and
snowshrouded bushes that beset the broken ground and dazzled by the
still driving storm But he knew that they would also divert attention
from his flight and beyond he could now see a white slope slowly
rising before him near whose crest a few dark spots were crawling in
file like Alpine climbers They were the Chinamen he was seeking He
had reasoned that when they discovered they were followed they would in
the absence of any chance of signaling through the storm detach one
of their number to give the alarm HIM he would follow He felt
his revolver safe on his hip he would use it only if necessary to
intimidate the spies

For some moments his ascent through the wet snow was slow and difficult
but as he advanced he felt a change of temperature corresponding to
that he had experienced that afternoon on the wagon coming down The air
grew keener the snow drier and finer He kept a sharp lookout for
the moving figures and scanned the horizon for some indication of the
prospectors deserted hut Suddenly the line of figures he was watching
seemed to be broken and then gathered together as a group Had they
detected him Evidently they had for as he had expected one of them
had been detached and was now moving at right angles from the party
towards the right With a thrill of excitement he urged his horse
forward the group was far to the left and he was nearing the solitary
figure But to his astonishment as he approached the top of the slope
he now observed another figure as far to the left of the group as he
was to the right and that figure he could see even at that distance
was NOT a Chinaman He halted for a better observation for an
instant he thought it might be the fugitive himself but as quickly he
recognized it was another manthe deputy It was HE whom the Chinaman
had discovered it was HE who had caused the diversion and the dispatch
of the vedette to warn the fugitive His own figure had evidently
not yet been detected His heart beat high with hope he again dashed
forward after the flying messenger who was undoubtedly seeking the
prospectors ruined hut andTrixit

But it was no easy matter At this elevation the snow had formed a
crust over which the single Chinamana lithe young figureskimmed
like a skater while Mastertons horse crashed though it into unexpected
depths Again the runner could deviate by a shorter cut while the
horseman was condemned to the one half obliterated trail The only thing
in Mastertons favor however was that he was steadily increasing his
distance from the group and the deputy sheriff and so cutting off
their connection with the messenger But the trail grew more and more
indistinct as it neared the summit until at last it utterly vanished
Still he kept up his speed toward the active little figurewhich now
seemed to be that of a mere boyskimming over the frozen snow Twice
a stumble and flounder of the mustang through the broken crust ought
to have warned him of his recklessness but now a distinct glimpse of
a low blackened shanty the prospectors ruined hut toward which
the messenger was making made him forget all else The distance was
lessening between them he could see the long pigtail of the fugitive
standing out from his bent head when suddenly his horse plunged forward
and downward In an awful instant of suspense and twilight such as
he might have seen in a dream he felt himself pitched headlong into
suffocating depths followed by a shock the crushing weight and
steaming flank of his horse across his shoulder utter darkness
andmerciful unconsciousness

How long he lay there thus he never knew With his returning
consciousness came this strange twilight againthe twilight of a
dream He was sitting in the new church at Canada City as he had sat
the first Sunday of his arrival there gazing at the pretty face of
Cissy Trixit in the pew opposite him and wondering who she was Again
he saw the startled awakened light that came into her adorable eyes
the faint blush that suffused her cheek as she met his inquiring gaze
and the conscious half conceited half girlish toss of her little
head as she turned her eyes away and then a file of brown Chinamen
muttering some harsh uncouth gibberish interposed between them This
was followed by what seemed to be the crashing in of the church roof a
stifling heat succeeded by a long deadly chill But he knew that
THIS last was all a dream and he tried to struggle to his feet to see
Cissys face againa reality that he felt would take him out of this
horrible tranceand he called to her across the pew and heard her
sweet voice again in answer and then a wave of unconsciousness once
more submerged him

He came back to life with a sharp tingling of his whole frame as if
pierced with a thousand needles He knew he was being rubbed and in his
attempts to throw his torturers aside he saw faintly by the light of a
flickering fire that they were Chinamen and he was lying on the floor
of a rude hut With his first movements they ceased and wrapping him
like a mummy in warm blankets dragged him out of the heap of loose snow
with which they had been rubbing him toward the fire that glowed upon
the large adobe hearth The stinging pain was succeeded by a warm glow
a pleasant languor which made even thought a burden came over him and
yet his perceptions were keenly alive to his surroundings He heard
the Chinamen mutter something and then depart leaving him alone But
presently he was aware of another figure that had entered and was now
sitting with its back to him at a rude table roughly extemporized from
a packingbox apparently engaged in writing It was a small Chinaman
evidently the one he had chased The events of the past few hourshis
mission his intentions and every incident of the pursuitflashed back
upon him Where was he What was he doing here Had Trixit escaped him

In his exhausted state he was unable to formulate a question which even
then he doubted if the Chinaman could understand So he simply watched
him lazily and with a certain kind of fascination until he should
finish his writing and turn round His long pigtail which seemed
ridiculously disproportionate to his sizethe pigtail which he
remembered had streamed into the air in his flighthad partly escaped
from the discovered hat under which it had been coiled But what was
singular it was not the wiry black pigtail of his Mongolian fellows
but soft and silky and as the firelight played upon it it seemed of a
shining chestnut brown It was likelikehe stoppedwas he dreaming
again A long sigh escaped him

The figure instantly turned He started It was Cissy Trixit There
was no mistaking that charming sensitive face glowing with health and
excitement albeit showing here and there the mark of the pigment with
which it had been stained now hurriedly washed off A little of it had
run into the corners of her eyelids and enhanced the brilliancy of her
eyes

He found his tongue with an effort What are you doing here he asked
with a faint voice and a fainter attempt to smile

Thats what I might ask about you she said pertly but with a slight
touch of scorn but I guess I know as well as I do about the others I
came here to see my father she added defiantly

And you are thetheoneI chased

Yes and Id have outrun you easily even with your horse to help
you she said proudly only I turned back when you went down into that
prospectors hole with your horse and his broken neck atop of you

He groaned slightly but more from shame than pain The young girl took
up a glass of whiskey ready on the table and brought it to him Take
that it will fetch you all right in a moment Popper says no bones are
broken

Masterton waived the proffered glass Your fatheris he here he
asked hurriedly recalling his mission

Not now hes gone to the stationtofetchmy clothes she said
with a little laugh

To the station repeated Masterton bewildered

Yes she replied to the station Of course you dont know the news
she added with an air of girlish importance Theyve stopped all
proceedings against him and hes as free as you are

Masterton tried to rise but another groan escaped him He was really
in pain Cissys bright eyes softened She knelt beside him her soft
breath fanning his hair and lifted him gently to a sitting position

Oh Ive done it before she laughed as she read his wonder with
his gratitude in his eyes The horse was already stiff and you
were nearly so by the time I came up to you and gotshe laughed
againthe OTHER Chinaman to help me pull you out of that hole

I know I owe you my life he said his face flushing

It was lucky I was there she returned naively perhaps lucky you
were chasing me

Im afraid that of the many who would run after you I should be the
least lucky he said with an attempt to laugh that did not however
conceal his mortification but I assure you that I only wished to have
an interview with your fathera BUSINESS interview perhaps as much in
his interest as my own

The old look of audacity came back to her face I guess thats what
they all came here for except one but it didnt keep them from
believing and saying he was a thief behind his back Yet they all wanted
hisconfidence she added bitterly

Masterton felt that his burning cheeks were confessing the truth of
this You excepted one he said hesitatingly

Yesthe deputy sheriff He came to help ME

You

Yes ME A coquettish little toss of her head added to his confusion
He threw up his job just to follow me without my knowing it to see
that I didnt come to any harm He saw me only once too at the house
when he came to take possession He said he thought I was clear grit
to risk everything to find father and he said he saw it in me when he
was there thats how he guessed where I was gone when I ran away and
followed me

He was as right as he was lucky said Masterton gravely But how did
you get here

She slipped down on the floor beside him with an unconscious movement
that her masculine garments only made the more quaintly girlish and
clasping her knee with both hands looked at the fire as she rocked
herself slightly backward and forward as she spoke

It will shock a proper man like you I know she began demurely but
I came ALONE with only a Chinaman to guide me I got these clothes from
our laundryman so that I shouldnt attract attention I would have got
a Chinese ladys dress but I couldnt walk in THEIR shoesshe looked
down at her little feet encased in wooden sandalsand I had a long
way to walk But even if I didnt look quite right to Chinamen no white
man was able to detect the difference You passed me twice in the stage
and you didnt know me I traveled night and day most of the time
walking and being passed along from one Chinaman to another or when
we were alone being slung on a pole between two coolies like a bale of
goods I ate what they could give me for I dared not go into a shop or
a restaurant I couldnt shut my eyes in their dens so I stayed awake
all night Yet I got ahead of you and the sheriffthough I didnt know
at the time what YOU were after she added presently

He was overcome with wondering admiration of her courage and of
selfreproach at his own shortsightedness This was the girl he had
looked upon as a spoiled village beauty satisfied with her small
triumphs and provincial elevation and vacant of all other purpose Here
was shethe allunconscious heroineand he her critic helpless at
her feet It was not a cheerful reflection and yet he took a certain
delight in his expiation Perhaps he had half believed in her without
knowing it What could he do or say I regret to say he dodged the
question meanly

And you think your disguise escaped detection he said looking
markedly at her escaped braid of hair

She followed his eyes rather than his words half pettishly caught up
the loosened braid swiftly coiled it around the top of her head and
clapping the weatherbeaten and battered conical hat back again upon it
defiantly said Yes Everybody isnt as critical as you are and even
you wouldnt beof a Chinaman

He had never seen her except when she was arrayed with the full
intention to affect the beholders and perfectly conscious of her
attractions he was utterly unprepared for this complete ignoring of
adornment now albeit he was for the first time aware how her real
prettiness made it unnecessary She looked fully as charming in this
grotesque headcovering as she had in that paragon of fashion the new
hat which had excited his tolerant amusement

Im afraid Im a very poor critic he said bluntly I never conceived
that this sort of thing was at all to your taste

I came to see my father because I wanted to she said with equal
bluntness

And I came to see him though I DIDNT want to he said with a cynical
laugh

She turned and fixed her brown eyes inquiringly upon him

Why did you come then

I was ordered by my directors

Then you did not believe he was a thief she asked her eyes
softening

It would ill become me to accuse your father or my directors he
answered diplomatically

She was quick enough to detect the suggestion of moral superiority
in his tone but woman enough to forgive it Youre no friend of
Windibrook she said I know

I am not he replied frankly

If you would like to see my popper I can manage it she said
hesitatingly Hell do anything for me she added with a touch of her
old pride

Who could blame him returned Masterton gravely But if he is a free
man now and able to go where he likes and to see whom he likes he may
not care to give an audience to a mere messenger

You wait and let me see him first said the girl quickly Then as the
sound of sleighbells came from the road outside she added Here he
is Ill get your clothes they are out here drying by the fire in
the shed She disappeared through a back door and returned presently
bearing his dried garments Dress yourself while I take popper into the
shed she said quickly and ran out into the road

Masterton dressed himself with difficulty Although circulation was now
restored and he felt a glow through his warmed clothes he had been
sorely bruised and shaken by his fall He had scarcely finished dressing
when Montagu Trixit entered from the shed Masterton looked at him with
a new interest and a respect he had never felt before There certainly
was little of the daughter in this keenfaced resolutelipped man
though his brown eyes like hers had the same frank steadfast
audacity With a business brevity that was hurried but not unkindly he
hoped Masterton had fully recovered

Thanks to your daughter Im all right now said Masterton I need
not tell you that I believe I owe my life to her energy and courage for
I think you have experienced what she can do in that way But YOU have
had the advantage of those who have only enjoyed her social
acquaintance in knowing all the time what she was capable of he added
significantly

She is a good girl said Trixit briefly yet with a slight rise in
color on his dark sallow cheek and a sudden wavering of his steadfast
eyes She tells me you have a message from your directors I think I
know what it is but we wont discuss it now As I am going directly to
Sacramento I shall not see them but I will give you an answer to take
to them when we reach the station I am going to give you a lift there
when my daughter is ready And here she is

It was the old Cissy that stepped into the room dressed as she was when
she left her fathers house two days before Oddly enough he fancied
that something of her old conscious manner had returned with her
clothes and as he stepped with her into the back seat of the covered
sleigh in waiting he could not help saying I really think I
understand you better in your other clothes

A slight blush mounted to Cissys cheek but her eyes were still
audacious All the same I dont think youd like to walk down Main
Street with me in that rig although you once thought nothing of taking
me over your old mill in your blue blouse and overalls And having
apparently greatly relieved her proud little heart by this enigmatic
statement she grew so chatty and confidential that the young man was
satisfied that he had been in love with her from the first

When they reached the station Trixit drew him aside Taking an envelope
marked Private Contracts from his pocket he opened it and displayed
some papers These are the securities Tell your directors that you
have seen them safe in my hands and that no one else has seen them
Tell them that if they will send me their renewed notes dated from
today to Sacramento within the next three days I will return the
securities That is my message

The young man bowed But before the coach started he managed to draw
near to Cissy You are not returning to Canada City he said

The young girl made a gesture of indignation No I am never going
there again I go with my popper to Sacramento

Then I suppose I must say goodby

The girl looked at him in surprise Popper says you are coming to
Sacramento in three days

Am I

He looked at her fixedly She returned his glance audaciously
steadfastly

You are she said in her low but distinct voice

I will

And he did




WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FONDA


PART I

Well said the editor of the Mountain Clarion looking up
impatiently from his copy Whats the matter now

The intruder in his sanctum was his foreman He was also acting as
pressman as might be seen from his shirtsleeves spattered with ink
rolled up over the arm that had just been working the Archimedian lever
that moves the world which was the editors favorite allusion to the
handpress that strict economy obliged the Clarion to use His braces
slipped from his shoulders during his work were looped negligently
on either side their functions being replaced by one hand which
occasionally hitched up his trousers to a securer position A pair
of downatheel slippersdear to the country printercompleted his
negligee

But the editor knew that the inkspattered arm was sinewy and ready
that a stout and loyal heart beat under the soiled shirt and that the
slipshod slippers did not prevent its owners foot from being put down
very firmly on occasion He accordingly met the shrewd goodhumored
blue eyes of his faithful henchman with an interrogating smile

I wont keep you long said the foreman glancing at the editors copy
with his habitual half humorous toleration of that work it being his
general conviction that news and advertisements were the only valuable
features of a newspaper I only wanted to talk to you a minute about
makin suthin more o this yer accident to Colonel Starbottle

Well weve a full report of it in havent we said the editor
wonderingly I have even made an editorial para about the frequency of
these accidents and called attention to the danger of riding those half
broken Spanish mustangs

Yes ye did that said the foreman tolerantly but ye see thars
some folks around here that allow it warnt no accident Theres a heap
of them believe that no runaway hoss ever mauled the colonel ez HE got
mauled

But I heard it from the colonels own lips said the editor and HE
surely ought to know

He mout know and he moutnt and if he DID know he wouldnt tell
said the foreman musingly rubbing his chin with the cleaner side of his
arm Ye didnt see him when he was picked up did ye

No said the editor Only after the doctor had attended him Why

Jake Parmlee ez picked him up outer the ditch says that he was half
choked and his black silk neckhandkercher was pulled tight around his
throat There was a mark on his nose ez ef some one had tried to gouge
out his eye and his left ear was chawed ez ef hed bin down in a
reglar roughandtumble clinch

He told me his horse bolted buckjumped threw him and he lost
consciousness said the editor positively He had no reason for lying
and a man like Starbottle who carries a Derringer and is a dead shot
would have left his mark on somebody if hed been attacked

Thats what the boys say is just the reason why he lied He was TOOK
SUDDENT dont ye seehed no showand dont like to confess it See
A man like HIM aint goin to advertise that he kin be tackled and left
senseless and no one else got hurt by it His political influence would
be ruined here

The editor was momentarily staggered at this large truth

Nonsense he said with a laugh Who would attack Colonel Starbottle
in that fashion He might have been shot on sight by some political
enemy with whom he had quarreledbut not BEATEN

Spose it warnt no political enemy said the foreman doggedly

Then who else could it be demanded the editor impatiently

Thats jest for the press to find out and expose returned the
foreman with a significant glance at the editors desk I reckon
thats whar the Clarion ought to come in

In a matter of this kind said the editor promptly the paper has no
business to interfere with a mans statement The colonel has a perfect
right to his own secretif there is one which I very much doubt But
he added in laughing recognition of the half reproachful half humorous
discontent on the foremans face what dreadful theory have YOU and the
boys got about itand what do YOU expect to expose

Well said the foreman very seriously its jest this You see the
colonel is mighty sweet on that Spanish woman Ramierez up on the hill
yonder It was her mustang he was ridin when the row happened near her
house

Well said the editor with disconcerting placidity

Wellhesitated the foreman you see theyre a bad lot those
Greasers especially the Ramierez her husband

The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial
prejudice against this race which he himself had always combated
Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estatethe last of many
leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee his landlordand had a
wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms Gambling took place
at the fonda and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican
did not however prevent the American from trying to win his money

Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel But in that case he
would have knifed himSpanish fashionand not without a struggle

Theres more ways they have o killin a man than that he might hev
been dragged off his horse by a lasso and choked said the foreman
darkly

The editor had heard of this vaquero method of putting an enemy hors
de combat but it was a clumsy performance for the public road and the
brutality of its manner would have justified the colonel in exposing it

The foreman saw the incredulity expressed in his face and said somewhat
aggressively Of course I know ye dont take no stock in whats said
agin the Greasers and thats what the boys know and what they said
and thats the reason why I thought I oughter tell ye so that ye
mightnt seem to be always favorin em

The editors face darkened slightly but he kept his temper and his
good humor So that to prove that the Clarion is unbiased where the
Mexicans are concerned I ought to make it their only accuser and cast
a doubt on the Americans veracity he said with a smile

I dont mean that said the foreman reddening Only I thought ye
mightas ye understand these folks waysye might be able to get at
them easy and mebbe make some copy outer the blamed thing It would
just make a stir here and be a big boom for the Clarion

Ive no doubt it would said the editor dryly However Ill make
some inquiries but you might as well let the boys know that the
Clarion will not publish the colonels secret without his permission
Meanwhile he continued smiling if you are very anxious to add
the functions of a reporter to your other duties and bring me any
discoveries you may make Illlook over your copy

He good humoredly nodded and took up his pen againa hint at which
the embarrassed foreman under cover of hitching up his trousers
awkwardly and reluctantly withdrew

It was with some natural youthful curiosity but no lack of loyalty to
Colonel Starbottle that the editor that evening sought this warhorse
of the Democracy as he was familiarly known in his invalid chamber at
the Palmetto Hotel He found the hero with a bandaged ear andperhaps
it was fancy suggested by the story of the chokingcheeks more than
usually suffused and apoplectic Nevertheless he was seated by the
table with a mint julep before him and welcomed the editor by instantly
ordering another

The editor was glad to find him so much better

Gad sir no bones broken but a good deal of possum scratching about
the head for such a little throw like that I must have slid a yard or
two on my left ear before I brought up

You were unconscious from the fall I believe

Only for an instant sira single instant I recovered myself with the
assistance of a Nothen gentlemana Mr Parmleewho was passing

Then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall

The colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips and set it
down Sir he ejaculated with astounded indignation

You say you were unconscious returned the editor lightly and some
of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to
be the cause They are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of
some foul play

Unknowingly Sir Do you take me for a chuckleheaded niggah that I
dont know when Im thrown from a buckjumping mustang or do they think
Im a Chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies Do
they know sir that the account I have given I am responsible for
sirpersonally responsible

There was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious
and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a
secret A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in
defense

They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly
disposed person during your unconsciousness explained the editor
diplomatically but as you say THAT was only for a moment and that you
were aware of everything that happenedHe paused

Perfectly sir Perfectly As plain as I see this julep before me I
had just left the Ramierez rancho The senoraa devilish pretty
woman sirafter a little playful badinage had offered to lend me
her daughters mustang if I could ride it home You know what it is
Mr Grey he said gallantly Im an older man than you sir but a
challenge from a dd fascinating creature I trust sir I am not yet
old enough to decline Gad sir I mounted the brute Ive ridden Morgan
stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback sir but Ive never thrown
my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before After he bolted I
held my own fairly but he buckjumped before I could lock my spurs
under him and the second jump landed me

How far from the Ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown

A matter of four or five hundred yards sir

Then your accident might have been seen from the fonda

Scarcely sir For in that case I may say without vanity
thatertheer senora would have come to my assistance

But not her husband

The oldfashioned shirtfrill which the colonel habitually wore grew
erectile with a swelling indignation possibly half assumed to conceal a
certain conscious satisfaction beneath Mr Grey he said with pained
severity as a personal friend of mine and a representative of the
pressa power which I respectI overlook a disparaging reflection
upon a lady which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and
thoughtlessness At the same time sir he added with illogical
sequence if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions he knew where
I could be found sir and that it was not my habit to decline
giving gentlemenof any nationalitysatisfactionsirpersonal
satisfaction

He paused and then added with a singular blending of anxiety and a
certain natural dignity I trust sir that nothing of thiserkind
will appear in your paper

It was to keep it out by learning the truth from you my dear colonel
said the editor lightly that I called today Why it was even
suggested he added with a laugh that you were half strangled by a
lasso

To his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh but brought his
hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed
face

I admit sir he said with a forced smile that I experienced
a certain sensation of choking and I may have mentioned it to Mr
Parmlee but it was due I believe sir to my cravat which I always
wear loosely as you perceive becoming twisted in my fall and in
rolling over

He extended his fat white hand to the editor who shook it cordially
and then withdrew Nevertheless although perfectly satisfied with his
mission and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the
subject Mr Greys curiosity was not wholly appeased What were the
relations of the colonel with the Ramierez family From what he himself
had said the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack
might have been possible and the assault itself committed while the
colonel was unconscious

Mr Grey however kept this to himself briefly told his foreman that
he found no reason to add to the account already in type and dismissed
the subject from his mind The colonel left the town the next day

One morning a week afterward the foreman entered the sanctum
cautiously and closing the door of the composingroom behind him
stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of
irresolution shamefacedness and humorous discomfiture in his face

Answering the editors look of inquiry he began slowly Mebbe ye
remember when we was talkin last week o Colonel Starbottles accident
I sorter allowed that he knew all the time WHY he was attacked that way
only he wouldnt tell

Yes I remember you were incredulous said the editor smiling

Well I take it all back I reckon he told all he knew I was wrong I
cave

Why asked the editor wonderingly

Well I have been through the mill myself

He unbuttoned his shirt collar pointed to his neck which showed a
slight abrasion and a small livid mark of strangulation at the throat
and added with a grim smile And Ive got about as much proof as I
want

The editor put down his pen and stared at him

You see Mr Grey it was partly your fault When you bedeviled me
about gettin that news and allowed I might try my hand at reportin
I was fool enough to take up the challenge So once or twice when I was
off duty here I hung around the Ramierez shanty Once I went in thar
when they were gamblin thar war one or two Americans thar that war
winnin as far as I could see and was pretty full o that aguardiente
that they sell tharthat kills at forty rods You see I had a kind o
suspicion that ef thar was any foul play goin on it might be worked
on these fellers ARTER they were drunk and war goin home with thar
winnins

So you gave up your theory of the colonel being attacked from
jealousy said the editor smiling

Hol on I aint through yet I only reckoned that ef thar was a gang
of roughs kept thar on the premises they might be used for that purpose
and I only wanted to ketch em at thar work So I jest meandered into the
road when they war about comin out and kept my eye skinned for what
might happen Thar was a kind o corral about a hundred yards down the
road half adobe wall and a stockade o palms on top of it about six
feet high Some of the palms were off and I peeped through but thar
warnt nobody thar I stood thar alongside the bank leanin my back
agin one o them openins and jest watched and waited

All of a suddent I felt myself grabbed by my coat collar behind and my
neckhandkercher and collar drawn tight around my throat till I couldnt
breathe The more I twisted round the tighter the clinch seemed to get
I couldnt holler nor speak but thar I stood with my mouth open pinned
back agin that cursed stockade and my arms and legs movin up and down
like one o them dancin jacks It seems funny Mr GreyI reckon I
looked like a darned foolbut I dont wanter feel agin as I did jest
then The clinch o my throat got tighter everything got black about
me I was jest goin off and kalkilatin it was about time for you to
advertise for another foreman when suthin brokefetched away

It was my collar button and I dropped like a shot It was a minute
before I could get my breath agin and when I did and managed to climb
that darned stockade and drop on the other side thar warnt a soul to
be seen A few hosses that stampeded in my gettin over the fence war
all that was there I was mighty shook up you betand to make the
hull thing perfectly ridiclous when I got back to the road after all
Id got through darn my skin ef thar warnt that pesky lot o drunken
men staggerin along jinglin the scads they had won and enjoyin
themselves and nobody afollowin em I jined em jest for kempanys
sake till we got back to town but nothin happened

But my dear Richards said the editor warmly this is no longer a
matter of mere reporting but of business for the police You must see
the deputy sheriff at once and bring your complaintor shall I Its
no joking matter

Hol on Mr Grey replied Richards slowly Ive told this to nobody
but younor am I goin tosabe Its an affair of my ownand I reckon
I kin take care of it without goin to the Revised Statutes of the State
of California or callin out the sheriffs posse

His humorous blue eyes just then had certain steely points in them like
glittering facets as he turned them away which the editor had
seen before on momentous occasions and he was speaking slowly and
composedly which the editor also knew boded no good to an adversary

Dont be a fool Richards he said quietly Dont take as a personal
affront what was a common vulgar crime You would undoubtedly have been
robbed by that rascal had not the others come along

Richards shook his head I might hev bin robbed a dozen times afore
THEY came alongef that was the little game No Mr Greyit warnt
no robbery

Had you been paying court to the Senora Ramierez like Colonel
Starbottle asked the editor with a smile

Not much returned Richards scornfully she aint my style Buthe
hesitated and then added thar was a mighty purty gal tharand her
darter I reckona reglar pink fairy She kem in only a minute and
they sorter hustled her out aginfor darn my skin ef she didnt look
as much out o place in that smoky old garlicsmellin room as an angel
at a bullfight And what got meshe was ez white ez you or me with
blue eyes and a lot o dark reddish hair in a long braid down her back
Why only for her purty singsong voice and her Gracias senor
youd hev reckoned she was a Blue Grass girl jest fresh from across the
plains

A little amused at his foremans enthusiasm Mr Grey gave an
ostentatious whistle and said Come now Richards look here Really

Only a little girla mere child Mr Greynot moren fourteen if a
day responded Richards in embarrassed depreciation

Yes but those people marry at twelve said the editor with a
laugh Look out Your appreciation may have been noticed by some other
admirer

He half regretted this speech the next moment in the quick flushthe
male instinct of rivalrythat brought back the glitter of Richardss
eyes I reckon I kin take care of that sir he said slowly and I
kalkilate that the next time I meet that chapwhoever he may behe
wont see so much of my back as he did

The editor knew there was little doubt of this and for an instant
believed it his duty to put the matter in the hands of the police
Richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a barroom fight
But reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to
avoid he concluded to make some personal investigation A stronger
curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him It was singular
too that Richardss description of the girl was that of a different and
superior typethe hidalgo or fairskinned Spanish settler If this
was true what was she doing thereand what were her relations to the
Ramierez


PART II

The next afternoon he went to the fonda Situated on the outskirts of
the town which had long outgrown it it still bore traces of its former
importance as a hacienda or smaller farm of one of the old Spanish
landholders The patio or central courtyard still existed as a
stableyard for carts and even one or two horses were tethered to the
railings of the inner corridor which now served as an open veranda to
the fonda or inn The opposite wing was utilized as a tienda or
general shopa magazine for such goods as were used by the Mexican
inhabitantsand belonged also to Ramierez

Ramierez himselfroundwhiskered and Sancho Panzalike in
buildwelcomed the editor with fat perfunctory urbanity The fonda and
all it contained was at his disposicion

The senora coquettishly bewailed in rising and falling inflections his
long absence his infidelity and general perfidiousness Truly he was
growing great in writing of the affairs of his nationhe could no
longer see his humble friends Yet not long agotruly that very
weekthere was the head impresor of Don Panchos imprenta himself who
had been there

A great man of a certainty and they must take what they could get
They were only poor innkeepers when the governor came not they must
welcome the alcalde To which the editorotherwise Don Panchoreplied
with equal effusion He had indeed recommended the fonda to his
impresor who was but a courier before him But what was this The
impresor had been ravished at the sight of a beautiful girla mere
muchachayet of a beauty that deprived the sensesthis angelclearly
the daughter of his friend Here was the old miracle of the orange in
full fruition and the lovely fragrant blossom all on the same treeat
the fonda And this had been kept from him

Yes it was but a thing of yesterday said the senora obviously
pleased The muchachafor she was but thathad just returned from the
convent at San Jose where she had been for four years Ah what would
you The fonda was no place for the child who should know only the
litany of the Virginand they had kept her there And nowthat she
was home againshe cared only for the horse From morning to night
Caballeros might come and go There might be a festivalall the same to
her it made nothing if she had the horse to ride Even now she was with
one in the fields Would Don Pancho attend and see Cota and her horse

The editor smilingly assented and accompanied his hostess along the
corridor to a few steps which brought them to the level of the open
meadows of the old farm inclosure A slight white figure on horseback
was careering in the distance At a signal from Senora Ramierez it
wheeled and came down rapidly towards them But when within a hundred
yards the horse was suddenly pulled up vaquero fashion and the little
figure leaped off and advanced toward them on foot leading the horse

To his surprise Mr Grey saw that she had been riding bareback and
from her discreet halt at that distance he half suspected ASTRIDE His
effusive compliments to the mother on this exhibition of skill were
sincere for he was struck by the girls fearlessness But when
both horse and rider at last stood before him he was speechless and
embarrassed

For Richards had not exaggerated the girls charms She was indeed
dangerously pretty from her tawny little head to her small feet
and her figure although comparatively diminutive was perfectly
proportioned Gray eyed and blonde as she was in color her racial
peculiarities were distinct and only the goodhumored and enthusiastic
Richards could have likened her to an American girl

But he was the more astonished in noticing that her mustang was as
distinct and peculiar as herselfa mongrel mare of the extraordinary
type known as a pinto or calico horse mottled in lavender and
pink Arabian in proportions and half broken Her greenish gray eyes
in which too much of the white was visible had he fancied a singular
similarity of expression to Cotas own

Utterly confounded and staring at the girl in her white many flounced
frock bare head and tawny braids as she stood beside this incarnation
of equine barbarism Grey could remember nothing like it outside of a
circus

He stammered a few words of admiration of the mare Miss Cota threw out
her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey and said

A la disposicion de le Usted senor

Grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this
formal curtsey and danced in the girls eyes and even fancied it shared
by the animal itself But he was a singularly good rider of untrained
stock and rather proud of his prowess He bowed

I accept that I may have the honor of laying the senoritas gift again
at her little feet

But here the burly Ramierez intervened Ah Mother of God May the
devil fly away with all this nonsense I will have no more of it he
said impatiently to the girl Have a care Don Pancho he turned to
the editor it is a trick

One I think I know said Grey sapiently The girl looked at him
curiously as he managed to edge between her and the mustang under the
pretense of stroking its glossy neck I shall keep MY OWN spurs
he said to her in a lower voice pointing to the sharp smallroweled
American spurs he wore instead of the large blunt fivepointed star
of the Mexican pattern

The girl evidently did not understand him thenthough she did a moment
later For without attempting to catch hold of the mustangs mane Grey
in a single leap threw himself across its back The animal utterly
unprepared was at first stupefied But by this time her rider had his
seat He felt her sensitive spine arch like a cats beneath him as she
sprang rocketwise into the air

But here she was mistaken Instead of clinging tightly to her flanks
with the inner side of his calves after the old vaquero fashion to
which she was accustomed he dropped his spurred heels into her sides
and allowed his body to rise with her spring and the cruel spur to cut
its track upward from her belly almost to her back

She dropped like a shot he dexterously withdrawing his spurs and
regaining his seat jarred but not discomfited Again she essayed a
leap the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her
smooth barrel She tried a third leap but this time dropped halfway as
she felt the steel scraping her side and then stood still trembling
Grey leaped off

There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife assisted
by a lounging vaquero in the corridor Ashamed of his victory Grey
turned apologetically to Cota To his surprise she glanced indifferently
at the trickling sides of her favorite and only regarded him curiously

Ah she said drawing in her breath you are strongand you
comprehend

It was only a trick for a trick senorita he replied reddening
let me look after those scratches in the stable he added as she was
turning away leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in
the rear

He would have taken the riata which she was still holding but she
motioned him to precede her He did so by a few feet but he had
scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly
by the shoulders and shoving him into the entrance slammed the door
upon him

Amazed and a little indignant he turned in time to hear a slight sound
of scuffling outside and to see Cota reenter with a flushed face

Pardon senor she said quickly but I feared she might have kicked
you Rest tranquil however for the servant he has taken her away

She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face who was angrily
driving the mustang toward the corral

Consider it no more I was rude Santa Maria I almost threw you too
but she added with a dazzling smile you must not punish me as you
have her For you are very strongand you comprehend

But Grey did not comprehend and with a few hurried apologies he managed
to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor Besides this unlookedfor
incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his
visitthe discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel
Starbottle

His inquiries of the Ramierez produced no result Senor Ramierez was not
aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda
and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free
of disturbance

Ah the peonan old vaquerowas not an angel truly but he was
dangerous only to the bull and the wild horsesand he was afraid even
of Cota Mr Grey was fain to ride home empty of information

He was still more concerned a week later on returning unexpectedly
one afternoon to his sanctum to hear a musical childish voice in the
composingroom

It was Cota She was there as Richards explained on his invitation to
view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would
not be likely to disturb Mr Grey at his work But the beaming face of
Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed
the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion and the unwonted
splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for
the occasion

Grey was worried and perplexed believing the girl a malicious flirt
Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish
curiosity as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press
or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his
composingstick He had even printed a card with her name Senorita
Cota Ramierez the type of which had been set up to the accompaniment
of ripples of musical laughter by her little brown fingers

The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not
noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly
on himself even while apparently listening to Richards were more than
ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had
wandered so coldly

He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foremans innocent
teteatete but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the
highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop and blew him an audacious
kiss from the tips of her fingers

For several days afterwards Richardss manner was tinged with a certain
reserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the
delicacy of a serious affection but he was surprised also to find that
his foremans eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat
abated Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped and the
editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened
by a chance incident

An intimate friend and old companion of hisone Enriquez Saltillohad
diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him Enriquez
was a scion of one of the oldest SpanishCalifornia families and in
addition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect
an intense admiration of American ways and habits and even to combine
the current California slang with his native precision of speechand a
certain ironical levity still more his own

It seemed therefore quite natural to Mr Grey to find him seated with
his feet on the editorial desk his hat cocked on the back of his head
reading the Clarion exchanges But he was up in a moment and had
embraced Grey with characteristic effusion

I find myself my leetle brother but an hour ago two leagues from this
spot I say to myself Hola It is the home of Don Panchomy friend
I shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader collecting
the subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry or gouging
out the eye of the rival editor at which I shall assist I hesitate no
longer I fly on the instant and I am here

Grey was delighted Saltillo knew the Spanish population thoroughlyhis
own superior race and their Mexican and Indian allies If any one could
solve the mystery of the Ramierez fonda and discover Richardss unknown
assailant it was HE But Grey contented himself at first with a
few brief inquiries concerning the beautiful Cota and her anonymous
association with the Ramierez Enriquez was as briefly communicative

Of your suspicions my leetle brother you are righton the half That
leetle angel of a Cota is without doubt the daughter of the adorable
Senora Ramierez but not of the admirable senorher husband Ah what
would you We are a simple patriarchal race thees Ramierez he was the
Mexican tenant of the old Spanish landlordsuch as my fatherand we
are ever the fathers of the poor and sometimes of their children It
is possible therefore that the exquisite Cota resemble the Spanish
landlord Ah stopremain tranquil I remember he went on suddenly
striking his forehead with a dramatic gesture the old owner of thees
ranch was my cousin Tiburcio Of a consequence my friend thees angel
is my second cousin Behold I shall call there on the instant I shall
embrace my longlost relation I shall introduce my best friend Don
Pancho who lofe her I shall say Bless you my children and it is
feenish I go I am gone even now

He started up and clapped on his hat but Grey caught him by the arm

For Heavens sake Enriquez be serious for once he said forcing him
back into the chair And dont speak so loud The foreman in the other
room is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl In fact it is on his
account that I am making these inquiries

Ah the gentleman of the pantuflos whose trousers will not remain I
have seen him friend Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive
from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash But in
recognition of Greys half serious impatience remain tranquil On him
I shall not go back I have said The friend of my friend is ever the
same as my friend He is truly not seducing to the eye but without
doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time I shall gif
to him my second cousin It is feenish I will tell him now

He attempted to rise but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey

Ive half a mind to let you do it and get chucked through the window
for your pains said the editor with a half laugh Listen to me This
is a more serious matter than you suppose

And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on
Starbottle and Richards As he proceeded he noticed however that
the ironical light died out of Enriquezs eyes and a singular
thoughtfulness yet unlike his usual precise gravity came over his
face He twirled the ends of his penciled mustachean unfailing sign of
Enriquezs emotion

The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as
the gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that
it come from Ramierez though they both were at the fonda he said
gravely The cause of it have not come today nor yesterday nor
last week The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant
Starbottle or excellent Richards before there was any American in
Californiabefore you and I my leetle brother have lif The cause
happen firstTWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO

The editors start of impatient incredulity was checked by the
unmistakable sincerity of Enriquezs face It is so he went on
gravely it is an old storyit is a long story I shall make him
shortand new

He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression

It was when the padres first have the mission and take the heathen and
convert himand save his soul It was their business you comprehend
my Pancho The more heathen they convert the more soul they save the
better business for their mission shop But the heathen do not always
wish to be convert the heathen fly the heathen skidaddle the
heathen will not remain or will backslide What will you do So the
holy fathers make a little game You do not of a possibility comprehend
how the holy fathers make a convert my leetle brother he added
gravely

No said the editor

I shall tell to you They take from the presidio five or six
dragonsyou comprehendthe cavalry soldiers and they pursue the
heathen from his little hut When they cannot surround him and he fly
they catch him with the lasso like the wild hoss The lasso catch
him around the neck he is obliged to remain Sometime he is strangle
Sometime he is dead but the soul is save You believe not Pancho I
see you wrinkle the browyou flash the eye you like it not Believe
me I like it not neither but it is so

He shrugged his shoulders threw away his half smoked cigarette and
went on

One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul
when he find the heathen who is a young girl have escape the soldiers
he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it He is lucky he catch
herbut look you She stop notshe still fly She not only fly but of
a surety she drag the good padre with her He cannot loose himself for
his riata is fast to the saddle the dragons cannot help for he is drag
so fast On the instant she have goneand so have the padre For why
It is not a young girl he have lasso but the devil You comprehendit
is a punishmenta retributionhe is feenish And forever

For every year he must come back a spiriton a spirit hossand swing
the lasso and make as if to catch the heathen He is condemn ever to
play his little game now there is no heathen more to convert he catch
what he can My grandfather have once seen himit is night and a storm
and he pass by like a flash My grandfather like it nothe is much
dissatisfied My uncle have seen him too but he make the sign of
the cross and the lasso have fall to the side and my uncle have much
gratification A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both
been picked up lassoed and dragged dead

Many peoples have died of him in the strangling Sometime he is seen
sometime it is the woman only that one seessometime it is but the
hoss But ever somebody is deadstrangle Of a truth my friend the
gallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped

The editor looked curiously at his friend There was not the slightest
suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner nothing indeed
but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament It struck
him also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang
which was always a part of his imitative levity He was puzzled

Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known he asked
after a pause

Among my peopleyes

And do YOU believe in it

Enriquez was silent Then he arose and shrugged his shoulders Quien
sabe It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story

He gravely put on his hat With it he seemed to have put on his old
levity Come behold it is a long time between drinks Let us to the
hotel and the barkeep who shall give up the smash of brandy and the
julep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the
swallow Let us skiddadle

Mr Grey returned to the Clarion office in a much more satisfied
condition of mind Whatever faith he held in Enriquezs sincerity for
the first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had
found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident The
legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital
copy

No names would be mentioned yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized
his own adventure he could not possibly object to this interpretation
of it The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of
a ghost story or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation Nor
could Richards find fault with this view of his own experience hitherto
kept a secret so long as it did not refer to his relations with the
fair Cota Summoning him at once to his sanctum he briefly repeated the
story he had just heard and his purpose of using it To his surprise
Richardss face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquezs
own

Its a good story Mr Grey he said awkwardly and I aint sayin
it aint mighty good newspaper stuff but it wont do NOW for the whole
mysterys up and the assailant found

Found When Why didnt you tell me before exclaimed Grey in
astonishment

I didnt reckon ye were so keen on it said Richards embarrassedly
andandit wasnt my own secret altogether

Go on said the editor impatiently

Well said Richards slowly and doggedly ye see there was a fool that
was sweet on Cota and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride
her cursed pink and yaller mustang Naturally the beast bolted at once
but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so when it
took to buckjumpin The first buck threw him clean into the road
but didnt stun him yet when he tried to rise the first thing he
knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody He was
held so tight that he couldnt turn but he managed to get out his
revolver and fire two shots under his arm The grip held on for a
minute and then loosened and the somethin slumped down on top o him
but he managed to work himself around And thenwhat do you think he
sawwhy that thar hoss with two bullet holes in his neck lyin
beside him but still grippin his coat collar and neckhandkercher in
his teeth Yes sir the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle the
villain that took me behind when I was leanin agin that cursed fence
was that same Godforsaken hellinvented pinto hoss

In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience and
the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda Undoubtedly
Cota had saved him from a similar attack

But why not tell this story with the other said the editor returning
to his first idea Its tremendously interesting

It wont do said Richards with dogged resolution

Why

Because Mr Greythat fool was myself

You Again attacked

Yes said Richards with a darkening face Again attacked and by the
same hoss Cotas hoss Whether Cota was or was not knowin its tricks
she was actually furious at me for killin itand its all over twixt
me and her

Nonsense said the editor impulsively she will forgive you You
didnt know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED Look at the
attack on you in the road

Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness Its no use Mr
Grey I oughter guessed it was a hoss thenthar was nothin else in
that corral No Cotas already gone away back to San Jose and I reckon
the Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off So on account
of its bein HER hoss and what happened betwixt me and her you see my
mouth is shut

And the columns of the Clarion too said the editor with a sigh

I know its hard sir but its better so Ive reckoned mebbe she was
a little crazy and since youve told me that Spanish yarn it mout
be that she was sort o playin she was that priest and trained that
mustang ez she did

After a pause something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as
he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders
Yes sir I was a fool for weve lost the only bit of real sensation
news that ever came in the way of the Clarion




A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS


It was four oclock in the afternoon and the hottest hour of the day
on that Sierran foothill The western sun streaming down the milelong
slope of closeset pine crests had been caught on an outlying ledge of
glaring white quartz covered with mining tools and debris and
seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage The air above it
shimmered and became visible A white canvas tent on it was an object
not to be borne the steeltipped picks and shovels intolerable to
touch and eyesight and a tilted tin prospecting pan falling over
flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence At such moments
the five members of the Eureka Mining Company prudently withdrew to
the nearest pinetree which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the
glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that
line cut like a knife The men lay or squatted in this shadow
feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond
the burning ledge Yet so irritating was the dry air fragrant with the
aroma of the heated pines that occasionally one would start up and walk
about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave
a momentary relief and as he believed saved him from sunstroke
Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously

Derned if the blasted bucket aint empty agin Not a drop left by
Jimminy

A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted
heads then every man lay down again as if trying to erase himself

Who brought the last demanded the foreman

I did said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably
on his back and if anybody reckons Im going to face Tophet agin
down that slope hes mistaken The speaker was thirstybut he had
principles

We must throw round for it said the foreman taking the dice from his
pocket

He cast the lowest number fell to Parkhurst a florid fullblooded
Texan All right gentlemen he said wiping his forehead and lifting
the tin pail with a resigned air only EF anything comes to me on that
bare stretch o stage roadand Im kinder seein things spotty and
black now remember you aint anywhar NEARER the water than you were I
aint sayin it for myselfbut it mout be rough on YOUand

Give ME the pail interrupted a tall young fellow rising Ill risk
it

Cries of Good old Ned and Hunky boy greeted him as he took the
pail from the perspiring Parkhurst who at once lay down again You
maynt be a professin Christian in good standin Ned Bray continued
Parkhurst from the ground but youre about as white as they make em
and youre goin to do a Heavenly Act I repeat it gentsa Heavenly
Act

Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail stopping only in the
underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern part of which he put
within the crown of his hat and stuck the rest in its band around
the outer brim making a parasollike shade above his shoulders Thus
equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail
which began to descend towards the stage road Here he was in the
full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks which
scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash The descent was
steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine
needles that had fallen from above Nor were his troubles over when
a few rods further he came upon the stage road which here swept in
a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain its red dust ground by
heavy wagons and packtrains into a fine powder was nevertheless so
heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the
foot and he was obliged to literally wade through it Yet there were
two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach
that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped
diagonally from it to creep along the mountain side to the spring he
was seeking

When he reached the trail he paused to take breath and wipe the
blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung
himself over the bank into it A single misstep here would have sent him
headlong to the tops of pinetrees a thousand feet below Holding his
pail in one hand with the other he steadied himself by clutching the
ferns and brambles at his side and at last reached the springa niche
in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide He had merely
accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the
Eureka Company four or five times a day But the day was exceptionally
hot He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear
cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin he threw the water over
his head and shoulders he swung his legs over the ledge and let the
overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles Gentle and delicious rigors
came over him He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark
olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain A hawk
was swinging lazily above it apparently within a stones throw of him
he knew it was at least a mile away Thirty feet above him ran the stage
road he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs the dull
jar of harness and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it
crawled up the long ascent part of which he had just passed He thought
of ita slow drifting cloud of dust and heat as he had often seen
it abandoned by even its passengers who sought shelter in the wayside
pines as they toiled behind it to the summitand hugged himself in
the grateful shadows of the spring It had passed out of hearing and
thought he had turned to fill his pail when he was startled by a
shower of dust and gravel from the road above and the next moment he
was thrown violently down blinded and pinned against the ledge by the
fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders His last flash of
consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped
from the pack of some passing mule

How long he remained unconscious he never knew It was probably
not long for his chilled hands and arms thrust by the blow on his
shoulders into the pool of water assisted in restoring him He came
to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back but his head and
shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft
fabrics and draperies which to his connecting consciousness seemed as
if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack
With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the
pool and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings In
doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesha soft bared arm With
the same astounding discovery came one more terrible that arm belonged
to the weight that was pressing him down and now assisted by his
struggles it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the
abyss below With a desperate effort he turned on his side caught the
bodyas such it wasdragged it back on the ledge at the same
moment that freeing his head from its coveringa feminine skirthe
discovered it was a woman

She had been also unconscious although the touch of his cold wet hand
on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself
in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes
Suddenly she began to stare at him to draw in her knees and feet toward
her sideways with a feminine movement as she smoothed out her skirt
and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned She was a tall
handsome girl from what he could judge of her halfsitting figure in
her torn silk dustcloak which although its cape and one sleeve were
split into ribbons had still protected her delicate wellfitting gown
beneath She was evidently a lady

Whatis itwhat has happened she said faintly yet with a slight
touch of formality in her manner

You must have fallenfrom the road above said Bray hesitatingly

From the road above she repeated with a slight frown as if to
concentrate her thought She glanced upward then at the ledge before
her and then for the first time at the darkening abyss below The
color which had begun to return suddenly left her face here and
she drew instinctively back against the mountain side Yes she half
murmured to herself rather than to him it must be so I was walking
too near the bankandI fell Then turning to him she said And you
found me lying here when you came

I think stammered Bray that I was here when you fell and II
broke the fall He was sorry for it a moment afterward

She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him saw the dust dirt and leaves
on his back and shoulders the collar of his shirt torn open and a
few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead Her black eyebrows
straightened again as she said coldly Dear me I am very sorry I
couldnt help it you know I hope you are not otherwise hurt

No he replied quickly But you are you sure you are not injured It
must have been a terrible shock

Im not hurt she said helping herself to her feet by the aid of the
mountainside bushes and ignoring his proffered hand But she
added quickly and impressively glancing upward toward the stage road
overhead why dont they come They must have missed me I must have
been here a long time its too bad

THEY missed you he repeated diffidently

Yes she said impatiently of course I wasnt alone Dont you
understand I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under
the trees It was so hot and stuffy My foot must have slipped up
thereandIsliddown Have you heard any one calling me Have you
called out yourself

Mr Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness
He smiled vaguely and foolishly But on turning around in her
impatience she caught sight of the chasm again and lapsed quite white
against the mountain side

Let me give you some water from the spring he said eagerly as she
sank again to a sitting posture it will refresh you

He looked hesitatingly around him he had neither cup nor flask but he
filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips She drank
a little extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket dipped
its point in the water and wiped her face delicately after a certain
feline fashion Then catching sight of some small object in the fork of
a bush above her she quickly pounced upon it and with a swift sweep
of her hand under her skirt put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER and stood on her
feet again

How does one get out of such a place she asked fretfully and then
glancing at him half indignantly why dont you shout

I was going to tell you he said gently that when you are a little
stronger we can get out by the way I came inalong the trail

He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline Somehow
with this tall beautiful creature beside him it looked more perilous
than before She may have thought so too for she drew in her breath
sharply and sank down again

Is there no other way

None

How did YOU happen to be here she asked suddenly opening her
gray eyes upon him What did you come here for she went on almost
impertinently

To fetch a pail of water He stopped and then it suddenly occurred
to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this
tall goodlooking girl even if he HAD saved her He gave a little
laugh and added mischievously Just like Jack and Jill you know

What she said sharply bending her black brows at him

Jack and Jill he returned carelessly I broke my crown you know
and YOUhe did not finish

She stared at him trying to keep her face and her composure but a
smile that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable here
lifted the corners of her mouth and she turned her face aside But
the smile and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed were
unfortunately on the side toward him Emboldened by this he went on
I couldnt think what had happened At first I had a sort of idea that
part of a mules pack had fallen on top of meblankets flour and all
that sort of thing you know until

Her smile had vanished Well she said impatiently until

Until I touched you Im afraid I gave you a shock my hand was
dripping from the spring

She colored so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the
time and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak which had been
half torn off her bare arm was pinned together over it When and how
had she managed to do it without his detecting the act

At all events she said coldly Im glad you have not received
greater injury fromyour mule pack

I think weve both been very lucky he said simply

She did not reply but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail
Then she listened I thought I heard voices she said half rising

Shall I shout he asked

No You say theres no usetheres only this way out of it

I might go up first and perhaps get assistancea rope or chair he
suggested

And leave me here alone she cried with a horrified glance at the
abyss No thank you I should be over that ledge before you came back
Theres a dreadful fascination in it even now No I think Id rather
goat once I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it I may
be weaker

She gave a petulant little shiver and then though paler and evidently
agitated composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft
ladylike way and leaned back against the mountain side He saw her also
glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief and with a
heightened color he quickly reknotted it around his throat They moved
from the ledge toward the trail Suddenly she started back

But its only wide enough for ONE and I neverNEVERcould even stand
on it a minute alone she exclaimed

He looked at her critically We will go together side by side he
said quietly but you will have to take the outside

Outside she repeated recoiling Impossible I shall fall

I shall keep hold of you he explained you need not fear that Stop
Ill make it safer He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief
which he wore around his shoulders knotted one end of it firmly to his
belt and handed her the other

Do you think you can hold on to that

Idont knowshe hesitated If I should fall

Stay a moment Is your belt strong He pointed to a girdle of yellow
leather which caught her tunic around her small waist

Yes she said eagerly its real leather

He gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it
They were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief

I feel much safer she said with a faint smile

But if I should fall he remarked looking into her eyes you would
go too Have you thought of that

Yes Her previous charming smile returned It would be really Jack
and Jill this time

They passed out on the trail Now I must take YOUR arm he said
laughingly not you MINE He passed his arm under hers holding it
firmly It was the one he had touched For the first few steps her
uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side which seemed
to slip sideways beneath her He was literally carrying her on his
shoulder But in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself
always leaning toward the hillside and presently she was able to help
him by a few steps She expressed her surprise at his skill

Its nothing I carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop

She stiffened slightly under this remark and indeed so far overdid her
attempt to walk without his aid that her foot slipped on a stone
and she fell outward toward the abyss But in an instant his arm was
transferred from her elbow to her waist and in the momentum of his
quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side

Im afraid youd have spilt the pail that time she said with a
slightly heightened color as she disengaged herself gently from his
arm

No he answered boldly for the pail never would have stiffened
itself in a tiff and tried to go alone

Of course not if it were only a pail she responded

They moved on again in silence The trail was growing a little steeper
toward the upper end and the road bank Bray was often himself obliged
to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them
Suddenly she stopped and caught his arm There she said Listen
Theyre coming

Bray listened he could hear at intervals a faroff shout then a nearer
onea nameEugenia So that was HERS

Shall I shout back he asked

Not yet she answered Are we near the top A sudden glow of
pleasure came over himhe knew not why except that she did not look
delighted excited or even relieved

Only a few yards more he said with an unaffected half sigh

Then Id better untie this she suggested beginning to fumble at the
knot of the handkerchief which linked them

Their heads were close together their fingers often met he would have
liked to say something but he could only add Are you sure you will
feel quite safe It is a little steeper as we near the bank

You can hold me she replied simply with a superbly unconscious
lifting of her arm as she yielded her waist to him again but without
raising her eyes

He didholding her rather tightly I fear as they clambered up the
remaining slope for it seemed to him as a last embrace As he lifted
her to the road bank the shouts came nearer and glancing up he saw
two men and a woman running down the hill toward them He turned to
Eugenia In that instant she had slipped the tattered dustcoat from her
shoulder thrown it over her arm set her hat straight and was calmly
awaiting them with a selfpossession and coolness that seemed to
shame their excitement He noticed too with the quick perception of
unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments that
she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side and was
wearing it on her breast

Goodness Heavens Genie What has happened Where have you been

Eugenia this is perfect madness began the elder man didactically
You have alarmed us beyond measurekept the stage waiting and now it
is gone

Genie Look here I say Weve been hunting for you everywhere Whats
up said the younger man with brotherly brusqueness

As these questions were all uttered in the same breath Eugenia replied
to them collectively It was so hot that I kept along the bank here
while you were on the other side I heard the trickle of water somewhere
down there and searching for it my foot slipped This gentlemanshe
indicated Braywas on a little sort of a trail there and assisted me
back to the road again

The two men and the woman turned and stared at Bray with a look of
curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern They
saw a youngish sort of man with a long mustache a two days growth of
beard a not overclean face that was further streaked with red on the
temple a torn flannel shirt that showed a very white shoulder beside
a sunburnt throat and neck and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy
high bootsin fact the picture of a brokendown miner But their
unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect
ease and equality with which he regarded them a regard the more
exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some
satire or humor in the situation

Ahem very much obliged I am sure Ier

The lady has thanked me interrupted Bray with a smile

Did you fall far said the younger man to Eugenia ignoring Bray

Not far she answered with a half appealing look at Bray

Only a few feet added the latter with prompt mendacity just a
little slip down

The three newcomers here turned away and surrounding Eugenia
conversed in an undertone Quite conscious that he was the subject of
discussion Bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance
from Eugenia The words YOU do it No YOU It would come better
from HER were distinctly audible to him To his surprise however
she suddenly broke through them and advancing to him with a dangerous
brightness in her beautiful eyes held out her slim hand My father
Mr Neworth my brother Harry Neworth and my aunt Mrs Dobbs she
said indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome
head all think I ought to give you something and send you away I
believe that is the way they put it I think differently I come to
ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me
todaywhich I shall never forget When he had returned her firm
handclasp for a minute she coolly rejoined the discomfited group

Shes no sardine said Bray to himself emphatically but I suspect
shell catch it from her folks for this I ought to have gone away at
once like a gentleman hang it

He was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow
her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed
up the hill with her when he reflected that it would only make matters
worse And with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had
not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades He
had forgotten them for these lazy snobbish purseproud San
Franciscansfor Bray had the miners supreme contempt for the moneyed
trading classes What would the boys think of him He flung himself over
the bank and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring But here
again he lingeredthe place had become suddenly hallowed How deserted
it looked without her He gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any
trace that she had lefta bow a bit of ribbon or even a hairpin that
had fallen from her

As the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own
reflection in the spring It certainly was not that of an Adonis
He laughed honestly his sense of humor had saved him from many an
extravagance and mitigated many a disappointment before this Well She
was a plucky handsome girleven if she was not for him and he might
never set eyes on her again Yet it was a hard pull up that trail once
more carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once
sustained a lovely girl He remembered her reply to his badinage
Of course notif it were only a pail and found a dozen pretty
interpretations of it Yet he was not in love No He was too poor and
too level headed for that And he was unaffectedly and materially tired
too when he reached the road again and rested leaving the spring and
its little idyl behind

By this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the Eureka Company
and the stage road was also in shadow so that his return through its
heavy dust was less difficult And when he at last reached the camp he
found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by
his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment for
it appeared that a wellknown San Francisco capitalist whom the
foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and
investment had actually come over from Red Dog for that purpose and
had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident and
delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to Sacramento without
making his examination

That was only his excusemere flapdoodle interrupted the
pessimistic Jerrold He was foolin you hed heard of suthin better
The idea of calling that affair an accident or one that would stop
any man who meant business

Bray had become uneasily conscious What was the accident he asked

A dd fool womans accident broke in the misogynist Parkhurst
and its true Thats what makes it so cussed mean For theres allus
a woman at the bottom of such thingsbet your life Think of em comin
here Thar ought to be a law agin it

But what was it persisted Bray becoming more apprehensive

Why what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him
his daughter and auntie to see the wonderful scenery with popa
dear as if it was a cheap Sundayschool panorama And what do these
chuckleheaded women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin
about and playin here we go round the mulberry bush until one of em
tumbles down a ravine And then theres a great to do and dear popa
was up and down the road yellin Me cheyld me cheyld And then there
was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got and the coach
goes off and popa dear gets left and then has to hurry off in a
buggy to catch it So WE get left too just because that Godforsaken
fool Neworth brings his women here

Under this recital poor Bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair
daughter of Neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring He
saw it all HIS was the fault It was HIS delay and dalliance with her
that had checked Neworths visit worse than that it was his subsequent
audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal
of the negotiations He had shipwrecked his partners prospects in his
absurd vanity and pride He did not dare to raise his eyes to their
dejected faces He would have confessed everything to them but the
same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her
adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips How might they not
misconstrue his conductand HERS Perhaps something of this was visible
in his face

Come old man said the cheerful misogynist with perfect innocence
dont take it so hard Some time in a mans life a womans sure to get
the drop on him as I said afore and this yer womans got the drop on
five of us Buthallo Ned old manwhats the matter with your head
He laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner

I hada slipon the trail he stammered Had to go back again for
another pailful Thats what delayed me you know boys he added But
its nothing

Nothing ejaculated Parkhurst clapping him on the back and twisting
him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions Nothing
Look at him gentlemen and he says its nothing Thats how a MAN
takes it HE didnt go round yellin and wringin his hands and sayin
Me payl me payl when it spilt He just humped himself and trotted
back for another And yet every drop of water in that overset bucket
meant hard work and hard sweat and was as precious as gold

Luckily for Bray whose mingled emotions under Parkhursts eloquence
were beginning to be hysterical the foreman interrupted

Well boys its time we got to work again and took another heave at
the old ledge But now that this job of Neworths is overI dont mind
tellin ye suthin As their leader usually spoke but little and to
the point the four men gathered around him Although I engineered this
affair and got it up somehow I never SAW that Neworth standing on
this ledge No boys I never saw him HERE The look of superstition
which Bray and the others had often seen on this old miners face
and which so often showed itself in his acts was there And though I
wanted him to come and allowed to have him come Im kinder relieved
that he didnt and so let whatsoever lucks in the air come to us five
alone boys just as we stand

The next morning Bray was up before his companions and although it was
not his turn offered to bring water from the spring He was not in love
with Eugeniahe had not forgotten his remorse of the previous daybut
he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her
image from his mind And he had heard that although Neworth had gone on
to Sacramento his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or
two at the ditch superintendents house on the summit only two miles
away She might pass on the road he might get a glimpse of her again
and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever and he should
have to take up the daily routine of his work again It was not loveof
THAT he was assuredbut it was the way to stop it by convincing himself
of its madness Besides in view of all the circumstances it was his
duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the
accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it

Thus Bray Alas none of these possibilities occurred He found the
spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscuritya
mere niche in the mountain side that held onlywater The stage road
was deserted save for an early curlyheaded schoolboy whom he found
lurking on the bank but who evaded his company and conversation
He returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy His late zeal as a
watercarrier had earned him a day or twos exemption from that duty
His place was taken the next afternoon by the womanhating Parkhurst
and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same
afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for Sacramento

But then occurred a singular coincidence The new waterbringer was
as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his
predecessor An hour passed and he did not return His unfortunate
partners toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge were
clamorous from thirst and Bray was becoming absurdly uneasy It could
not be possible that Eugenias accident had been repeated Or had she
met him with inquiries But no she was already gone The mystery
was presently cleared however by the abrupt appearance of Parkhurst
running towards them but WITHOUT HIS PAIL The cry of consternation and
despair which greeted that discovery was however quickly changed by
a single breathless half intelligible sentence he had shot before him
from his panting lips And he was holding something in his outstretched
palm that was more eloquent than words Gold

In an instant they had him under the shade of the pinetree and were
squatting round him like schoolboys He was profoundly agitated
His story far from being brief was incoherent and at times seemed
irrelevant but that was characteristic They would remember that he had
always held the theory that even in quartz mining the deposits were
always found near water past or present with signs of fluvial erosion
He didnt call himself one of your blanked scientific miners but his
head was level It was all very well for them to say Yes yes NOW
but they didnt use to Well when he got to the spring he noticed
that there had been a kind of landslide above it of course from water
cleavage and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side
where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes

Excited as Bray was he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track
made by Eugenia in her fall which he himself had noticed But he had
thought only of HER

When I saw that continued Parkhurst more rapidly and coherently
I saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came
throughas if it had been the old channel of the spring I widened it
a little with my clasp knife and thenin a little pouch or pocket of
decomposed quartzI found that Not only that boys he continued
rising with a shout but the whole slope above the spring is a mass of
seepage underneath as if youd played a hydraulic hose on it and its
ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz

The men leaped to their feet in another moment they had snatched picks
pans and shovels and the foreman leading with a coil of rope thrown
over his shoulders were all flying down the trail to the highway
Their haste was wise The spring was not on THEIR claim it was known to
others it was doubtful if Parkhursts discovery with his knife amounted
to actual WORK on the soil They must take it up with a formal notice
and get to work at once

In an hour they were scattered over the mountain side like bees
clinging to the fragrant slope of laurel and myrtle above the spring An
excavation was made beside it and the ledge broadened by a dozen
feet Even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled
prospecting pans And when the Pioneer Coach slowly toiled up the road
that afternoon the passengers stared at the scarcely dry Notice of
Location pinned to the pine by the road bank whence Eugenia had fallen
two days before

Eagerly and anxiously as Edward Bray worked with his companions it was
with more conflicting feelings There was a certain sense of desecration
in their act How her proud lip would have curled had she seen himhe
who but a few hours before would have searched the whole slope for
the treasure of a ribbon a handkerchief or a bow from her dressnow
delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so
mysteriously disclosed Mysteriously he believed for he had not fully
accepted Parkhursts story That gentle misogynist had never been an
active prospector an inclination to theorize without practice and to
combat his partners experience were all against his alleged process of
discovery although the gold was actually there and his conduct that
afternoon was certainly peculiar He did but little of the real
work but wandered from man to man with suggestions advice and
exhortations and the air of a superior patron This might have been
characteristic but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and
watchfulness He was continually scanning the stage road and the trail
staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance and at times falling
into fits of strange abstraction At other times he would draw near to
one of his fellow partners as if for confidential disclosure and then
check himself and wander aimlessly away And it was not until evening
came that the mystery was solved

The prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined the slope above
and below had been fully explored and tested with a result and promise
that outran their most sanguine hopes There was no mistaking the fact
that they had made a big strike That singular gravity and reticence
so often observed in miners at these crises had come over them as
they sat that night for the last time around their old campfire on
the Eureka ledge when Parkhurst turned impulsively to Bray Roll over
here he said in a whisper I want to tell ye suthin

Bray rolled beyond the squatting circle and the two men gradually
edged themselves out of hearing of the others In the silent abstraction
that prevailed nobody noticed them

Its got suthin to do with this discovery said Parkhurst in a low
mysterious tone but as far as the gold goes and our equal rights to
it as partners it dont affect them If I he continued in a slightly
patronizing paternal tone choose to make you and the other boys
sharers in what seems to be a special Providence to ME I reckon we
wont quarrel on it Its a mighty curious singular thing Its one
of those things ye read about in books and dont take any stock in But
weve got the goldand Ive got the black and white to prove iteven
if it aint exactly human

His voice sank so low his manner was so impressive that despite his
known exaggeration Bray felt a slight thrill of superstition Meantime
Parkhurst wiped his brow took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of
laurel from his pocket and drew a long breath

When I got to the spring this afternoon he went on in a nervous
tremulous and scarcely audible voice I saw this bit o paper folded
notewise lyin on the ledge before it On top of it was this sprig
of laurel to catch the eye I aint the man to pry into other folks
secrets or read what aint mine But on the back o this note was
written To Jack Its a common enough name but its a singular thing
ef youll recollect thar aint ANOTHER Jack in this company not on the
whole ridge betwixt this and the summit except MYSELF So I opened it
and this is what it read He held the paper sideways toward the leaping
light of the still near campfire and read slowly with the emphasis of
having read it many times before

I want you to believe that I at least respect and honor your honest
manly calling and when you strike it rich as you surely will I hope
you will sometimes think of Jill

In the thrill of joy hope and fear that came over Bray he could see
that Parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret but had not
even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion But do you
know anybody named Jill he asked breathlessly

Its no NAME said Parkhurst in a sombre voice its a THING

A thing repeated Bray bewildered

Yes a measureyou knowtwo fingers of whiskey

Oh a gill said Bray

Thats what I said young man returned Parkhurst gravely

Bray choked back a hysterical laugh spelling was notoriously not one of
Parkhursts strong points But what has a gill got to do with it he
asked quickly

Its one of them Sphinx things dont you see A sort of riddle or
rebus you know Youve got to study it out as them old chaps did But
I fetched it What comes after gills eh

Pints I suppose said Bray

And after pints

Quarts

QUARTZ and there you are So I looked about me for quartz and sure
enough struck it the first pop

Bray cast a quick look at Parkhursts grave face The man was evidently
impressed and sincere Have you told this to any one he asked
quickly

No

Then DONT or youll spoil the charm and bring us ill luck Thats
the rule you know I really dont know that you ought to have told
me added the artful Bray dissembling his intense joy at this proof of
Eugenias remembrance

But said Parkhurst blankly you see old man youd been the last
man at the spring and I kinder thought

Dont think said Bray promptly and above all dont talk not a
word to the boys of this Stay Give me the paper and the sprig Ive
got to go to San Francisco next week and Ill take care of it and think
it out He knew that Parkhurst might be tempted to talk but without
the paper his story would be treated lightly Parkhurst handed him the
paper and the two men returned to the campfire

That night Bray slept but little The superstition of the lover is
no less keen than that of the gambler and Bray while laughing at
Parkhursts extravagant fancy I am afraid was equally inclined to
believe that their good fortune came through Eugenias influence
At least he should tell her so and her precious note became now an
invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her The only fear that
possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of
her note before she left that afternoon the only thing he could not
understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring
for she could not have taken it herself But this would doubtless be
explained by her in San Francisco whither he intended to seek her His
affairs the purchasing of machinery for their new claim would no doubt
give him easy access to her father

But it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and
fashionable outfit in San Francisco and quite another to stand before
the palatial residence of the Neworths on Rincon Hill with the
consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the Neworths
discourtesy on the mountain and even in his fine feathers Bray
hesitated At this moment a carriage rolled up to the door and Eugenia
an adorable vision of laces and silks alighted

Forgetting everything else he advanced toward her with outstretched
hand He saw her start a faint color come into her face he knew he
was recognized but she stiffened quickly again the color vanished her
beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment and then with
the faintest inclination of her proud head she swept by him and entered
the house

But Bray though shocked was not daunted and perhaps his own pride was
awakened He ran to his hotel summoned a messenger inclosed her note
in an envelope and added these lines


DEAR MISS NEWORTHI only wanted to thank you an hour ago as I should
like to have done before for the kind note which I inclose but which
you have made me feel I have no right to treasure any longer and to
tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than
fulfilled

Yours very gratefully

EDMUND BRAY


Within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply

Miss Neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good
fortune which prevented Mr Bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her
foolish note

Cold as this response was Brays heart leaped She HAD lingered on the
summit and HAD expected a reply He seized his hat and jumping into
the first cab at the hotel door drove rapidly back to the house He
had but one idea to see her at any cost but one concern to avoid a
meeting with her father first or a denial at her very door

He dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the
house It had a large garden in the rear reclaimed from the adjacent
scrub oak infested sand hill and protected by a high wall If he
could scale that wall he could command the premises It was a bright
morning she might be tempted into the garden A taller scrub oak grew
near the wall to the mountainbred Bray it was an easy matter to swing
himself from it to the wall and he did But his momentum was so great
that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden
to save himself from falling there He heard a little cry felt his feet
strike some tin utensil and rolled on the ground beside Eugenia and her
overturned wateringpot

They both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to
laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each

But we are not on the mountains now Mr Bray said Eugenia taking
her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening
eyebrows

But we are quits said Bray And you now know my real name I only
came here to tell you why I could not answer your letter the same day I
never got itI mean he added hurriedly another man got it first

She threw up her head and her face grew pale ANOTHER man got it she
repeated and YOU let another man

No no interrupted Bray imploringly You dont understand One of my
partners went to the spring that afternoon and found it but he neither
knows who sent it nor for whom it was intended He hastily recounted
Parkhursts story his mysterious belief and his interpretation of
the note The color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and
eyes I had gone twice to the spring after I saw you but I couldnt
bear its deserted look without you he added boldly Here seeing her
face grew grave again he added But how did you get the letter to the
spring and how did you know that it was found that day

It was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating but the combination
was charming in her proud face I got the little schoolboy at the
summit she said with girlish hesitation to take the note He knew
the spring but he didnt know YOU I told himit was very foolish I
knowto wait until you came for water to be certain that you got the
note to wait until you came up for I thought you might question him
or give him some word Her face was quite rosy now But she added
and her lip took a divine pout he said he waited TWO HOURS that you
never took the LEAST CONCERN of the letter or him but went around the
mountain side peering and picking in every hole and corner of it and
then he got tired and ran away Of course I understand it now it wasnt
YOU but oh please I beg you Mr Bray dont

Bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught and which
had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment

And now dont you think Mr Bray she added demurely that you had
better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door
and call upon me properly

But your father

My father as a wellknown investor regrets exceedingly that he did
not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview
He is as your foreman knows exceedingly interested in the mines on
Eureka ledge He will be glad if you will call She led him to a little
door in the wall which she unbolted And now Jill must say goodby
to Jack for she must make herself ready to receive a Mr Bray who is
expected

And when Bray a little later called at the front door he was
respectfully announced He called another day and many days after He
came frequently to San Francisco and one day did not return to his old
partners He had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared
had made the first strike on Eureka mountain




MR BILSONS HOUSEKEEPER


I

When Joshua Bilson of the Summit House Buckeye Hill lost his wife
it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the
management of the hotel Already all Buckeye had considered this a mere
preliminary to taking another wife after a decent probation as the
relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate
and Bilson was a man and not above female influence There was
however some change of opinion on that point when Miss Euphemia Trotter
was engaged for that position Buckeye Hill which had confidently
looked forward to a buxom widow or with equal confidence to the
promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid was startled
by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age and above the medium
height at once serious precise and masterful and to all appearances
outrageously competent More carefully taking stock of her it was
accepted she had three good pointsdark serious eyes a trim but
somewhat thin figure and wellkept hands and feet These which in
so susceptible a community would have been enough in the words of one
critic to have married her to three men she seemed to make of little
account herself and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make
them of account was ceremonious and frigid Indeed she seemed to occupy
herself entirely with looking after the servants Chinese and Europeans
examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers in a fashion
that made her respected andfeared It was whispered in fact that
Bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife and that he was
henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet

Nevertheless he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence
that seemed incompatible with their relative positions It gave rise
to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting Miss Trotter had a
secret interest in the hotel and represented a San Francisco syndicate
Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property and had advanced large
sums to Bilson Miss Trotter was a woman of no property but she was
the only daughter ofvariouslya late distinguished nobleman a ruined
millionaire and a foreign statesman bent on making her own living

Alas for romance Miss Euphemia Trotter or Miss E Trotter as she
preferred to sign herself loathing her sentimental prefix was really
a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary where
she eventually became a teacher She had survived her parents and a
neglected childhood and had worked hard for her living since she
was fourteen She had been a nurse in a hospital an assistant in a
reformatory had observed men and women under conditions of pain and
weakness and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness
and suffering yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy
which she used equally to herself as to others That she had ever
indulged in any romance of human existence I greatly doubt the lanky
girl teacher at the Vermont academy had enough to do to push herself
forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences and so
became a prematurely hard duenna paid to look out for restrain and
report if necessary any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her
companions A pronounced old maid at fifteen she had nothing to
forget or forgive in others and still less to learn from them

It was spring and down the long slopes of Buckeye Hill the flowers were
already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains and the
winds no longer brought their monotonous patter In the pine woods there
were the song and flash of birds and the quickening stimulus of the
stirring aromatic sap Miners and tunnelmen were already forsaking
the direct road for a ramble through the woodland trail and its sylvan
charms and occasionally breaking into shouts and horseplay like great
boys The schoolchildren were disporting there there were some older
couples sentimentally gathering flowers side by side Miss Trotter was
also there but making a short cut from the bank and express office and
by no means disturbed by any gentle reminiscence of her girlhood or any
other instinctive participation in the wanton season Spring came she
knew regularly every year and brought spring cleaning and other
necessary changes and rehabilitations This year it had brought also
a considerable increase in the sum she was putting by and she
was perhaps satisfied in a practical way if not with the blind
instinctiveness of others She was walking leisurely holding her gray
skirt well over her slim ankles and smartly booted feet and clear of
the brushing of daisies and buttercups when suddenly she stopped A few
paces before her partly concealed by a myrtle a young woman startled
at her approach had just withdrawn herself from the embrace of a young
man and slipped into the shadow Nevertheless in that moment Miss
Trotters keen eyes had recognized her as a very pretty Swedish girl
one of her chambermaids at the hotel Miss Trotter passed without a
word but gravely She was not shocked nor surprised but it struck
her practical mind at once that if this were an affair with impending
matrimony it meant the loss of a valuable and attractive servant if
otherwise a serious disturbance of that servants duties She must look
out for another girl to take the place of Frida Pauline Jansen that
was all It is possible therefore that Miss Jansens criticism of Miss
Trotter to her companion as a spying jealous old cat was unfair This
companion Miss Trotter had noticed only to observe that his face and
figure were unfamiliar to her His red shirt and heavy boots gave no
indication of his social condition in that locality He seemed more
startled and disturbed at her intrusion than the girl had been but
that was more a condition of sex than of degree she also knew In
such circumstances it is the woman always who is the most composed and
selfpossessed

A few days after this Miss Trotter was summoned in some haste to the
office Chris Calton a young man of twentysix partner in the Roanoke
Ledge had fractured his arm and collarbone by a fall and had been
brought to the hotel for that rest and attention under medical advice
which he could not procure in the Roanoke companys cabin She had
a retired quiet room made ready When he was installed there by the
doctor she went to see him and found a goodlooking curly headed young
fellow even boyish in appearance and manner who received her with that
air of deference and timidity which she was accustomed to excite in the
masculine breastwhen it was not accompanied with distrust It struck
her that he was somewhat emotional and had the expression of one who
had been spoiled and petted by women a rather unusual circumstance
among the men of the locality Perhaps it would be unfair to her to say
that a disposition to show him that he could expect no such nonsense
THERE sprang up in her heart at that moment for she never had
understood any tolerance of such weakness but a certain precision and
dryness of manner was the only result of her observation She adjusted
his pillow asked him if there was anything that he wanted but took her
directions from the doctor rather than from himself with a practical
insight and minuteness that was as appalling to the patient as it was an
unexpected delight to Dr Duchesne I see you quite understand me Miss
Trotter he said with great relief

I ought to responded the lady dryly I had a dozen such cases some
of them with complications while I was assistant at the Sacramento
Hospital

Ah then returned the doctor dropping gladly into purely
professional detail youll see this is very simple not a comminuted
fracture constitution and blood healthy all youve to do is to see
that he eats properly keeps free from excitement and worry but does
not get despondent a little company his partners and some of the boys
from the Ledge will drop in occasionally not too much of THEM you
know and of course absolute immobility of the injured parts The lady
nodded the patient lifted his blue eyes for an instant to hers with
a look of tentative appeal but it slipped off Miss Trotters dark
pupilswhich were as abstractedly critical as the doctorswithout
being absorbed by them When the door closed behind her the doctor
exclaimed By Jove youre in luck Chris Thats a splendid woman
Just the one to look after you The patient groaned slightly Do what
she says and well pull you through in no time Why shes able to
adjust those bandages herself

This indeed she did a week later when the surgeon had failed to call
unveiling his neck and arm with professional coolness and supporting
him in her slim arms against her stiff erect buckramed breast while
she replaced the splints with masculine firmness of touch and serene
and sexless indifference His stammered embarrassed thanks at the
relieffor he had been in considerable painshe accepted with a
certain pride as a tribute to her skill a tribute which Dr Duchesne
himself afterward fully indorsed

On reentering his room the third or fourth morning after his advent at
the Summit House she noticed with some concern that there was a slight
flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought
presaged fever But an examination of his pulse and temperature
dispelled that fear and his talkativeness and good spirits convinced
her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his
despondency A few days later this cheerfulness not being continued
Dr Duchesne followed Miss Trotter into the hall We must try to keep
our patient from moping in his confinement you know he began with
a slight smile and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature
accustomed to be amused andererpetted

His friends were here yesterday returned Miss Trotter dryly but I
did not interfere with them until I thought they had stayed long enough
to suit your wishes

I am not referring to THEM said the doctor still smiling but you
know a womans sympathy and presence in a sickroom is often the best of
tonics or sedatives

Miss Trotter raised her eyes to the speaker with a half critical
impatience

The fact is the doctor went on I have a favor to ask of you for our
patient It seems that the other morning a new chambermaid waited upon
him whom he found much more gentle and sympathetic in her manner than
the others and more submissive and quiet in her wayspossibly because
she is a foreigner and accustomed to servitude I suppose you have no
objection to HER taking charge of his room

Miss Trotters cheek slightly flushed Not from wounded vanity but
from the consciousness of some want of acumen that had made her make a
mistake She had really believed from her knowledge of the patients
character and the doctors preamble that he wished HER to show some
more kindness and personal sympathy to the young man and had even been
prepared to question its utility She saw her blunder quickly and at
once remembering that the pretty Swedish girl had one morning taken the
place of an absent fellow servant in the rebound from her error she
said quietly You mean Frida Certainly she can look after his
room if he prefers her But for her blunder she might have added
conscientiously that she thought the girl would prove inefficient but
she did not She remembered the incident of the wood yet if the girl
had a lover in the wood she could not urge it as a proof of incapacity
She gave the necessary orders and the incident passed

Visiting the patient a few days afterward she could not help noticing a
certain shy gratitude in Mr Caltons greeting of her which she quietly
ignored This forced the ingenuous Chris to more positive speech
He dwelt with great simplicity and enthusiasm on the Swedish girls
gentleness and sympathy You have no idea ofhernatural tenderness
Miss Trotter he stammered naively Miss Trotter remembering the
wood thought to herself that she had some faint idea of it but did not
impart what it was He spoke also of her beauty not being clever enough
to affect an indifference or ignorance of it which made Miss Trotter
respect him and smile an unqualified acquiescence Frida certainly was
pretty But when he spoke of her as Miss Jansen and said she was so
much more ladylike and refined than the other servants she replied by
asking him if his bandages hurt him and receiving a negative answer
graciously withdrew

Indeed his bandages gave him little trouble now and his improvement
was so marked and sustained that the doctor was greatly gratified
and indeed expressed as much to Miss Trotter with the conscientious
addition that he believed the greater part of it was due to her capable
nursing Yes maam he has to thank YOU for it and no one else

Miss Trotter raised her dark eyes and looked steadily at him Accustomed
as he was to men and women the look strongly held him He saw in her
eyes an intelligence equal to his own a knowledge of good and evil and
a toleration and philosophy equal to his own but a something else that
was as distinct and different as their sex And therein lay its charm
for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty
eyes which he had never noticed before without any aggressive
intellectual quality And with this alas came the mans propensity to
reason It meant of course but ONE thing he saw it all now If HE in
his preoccupation and coolness had noticed her eyes so also had the
younger and emotional Chris The young fellow was in love with her It
was that which had stimulated his recovery and she was wondering if he
the doctor had observed it He smiled back the superior smile of our
sex in moments of great inanity and poor Miss Trotter believed he
understood her A few days after this she noticed that Frida Jansen was
wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket She remembered
now that Mr Bilson had told her that the Roanoke Ledge was very rich
and that Calton was likely to prove a profitable guest But it was not
HER business

It became her business however some days later when Mr Calton was so
much better that he could sit in a chair or even lounge listlessly
in the hall and corridor It so chanced that she was passing along
the upper hall when she saw Fridas pink cotton skirt disappear in an
adjacent room and heard her light laugh as the door closed But the
room happened to be a cardroom reserved exclusively for gentlemens
poker or euchre parties and the chambermaids had no business there
Miss Trotter had no doubt that Mr Calton was there and that Frida knew
it but as this was an indiscretion so open flagrant and likely to be
discovered by the first passing guest she called to her sharply She
was astonished however at the same moment to see Mr Calton walking in
the corridor at some distance from the room in question Indeed she was
so confounded that when Frida appeared from the room a little flurried
but with a certain audacity new to her Miss Trotter withheld her
rebuke and sent her off on an imaginary errand while she herself
opened the cardroom door It contained simply Mr Bilson her employer
his explanation was glaringly embarrassed and unreal Miss Trotter
affected obliviousness but was silent perhaps she thought her employer
was better able to take care of himself than Mr Calton

A week later this tension terminated by the return of Calton to Roanoke
Ledge a convalescent man A very pretty watch and chain afterward were
received by Miss Trotter with a few lines expressing the gratitude of
the expatient Mr Bilson was highly delighted and frequently borrowed
the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing
powers of the Summit Hotel What Mr Calton sent to the more attractive
and flirtatious Frida did not as publicly appear and possibly Mr
Bilson did not know it The incident of the cardroom was forgotten
Since that discovery Miss Trotter had felt herself debarred from taking
the girls conduct into serious account and it did not interfere with
her work


II

One afternoon Miss Trotter received a message that Mr Calton desired
a few moments private conversation with her A little curious she had
him shown into one of the sittingrooms but was surprised on entering
to find that she was in the presence of an utter stranger This was
explained by the visitor saying briefly that he was Chriss elder
brother and that he presumed the name would be sufficient introduction
Miss Trotter smiled doubtfully for a more distinct opposite to Chris
could not be conceived The stranger was apparently strong practical
and masterful in all those qualities in which his brother was charmingly
weak Miss Trotter for no reason whatever felt herself inclined to
resent them

I reckon Miss Trotter he said bluntly that you dont know anything
of this business that brings me here At least he hesitated with a
certain rough courtesy I should judge from your general style and gait
that you wouldnt have let it go on so far if you had but the fact is
that darned fool brother of minebeg your pardonhas gone and got
himself engaged to one of the girls that help herea yellowhaired
foreigner called Frida Jansen

I was not aware that it had gone so far as that said Miss Trotter
quietly although his admiration for her was well known especially to
his doctor at whose request I selected her to especially attend to your
brother

The doctor is a fool broke in Mr Calton abruptly He only thought
of keeping Chris quiet while he finished his job

And really Mr Calton continued Miss Trotter ignoring the
interruption I do not see what right I have to interfere with the
matrimonial intentions of any guest in this house even though oras
you seem to put itBECAUSE the object of his attentions is in its
employ

Mr Calton staredangrily at first and then with a kind of wondering
amazement that any womanabove all a housekeepershould take such a
view But he stammered I thought youyoulooked after the conduct
of those girls

Im afraid youve assumed too much said Miss Trotter placidly My
business is to see that they attend to their duties here Frida Jansens
duty wasas I have just told youto look after your brothers room
And as far as I understand you you are not here to complain of her
inattention to that duty but of its resulting in an attachment on your
brothers part and as you tell me an intention as to her future
which is really the one thing that would make my looking after her
conduct an impertinence and interference If you had come to tell me
that he did NOT intend to marry her but was hurting her reputation I
could have understood and respected your motives

Mr Calton felt his face grow red and himself discomfited He had come
there with the firm belief that he would convict Miss Trotter of a grave
fault and that in her penitence she would be glad to assist him in
breaking off the match On the contrary to find himself arraigned and
put on his defense by this tall slim woman erect and smartly buckramed
in logic and whalebone was preposterous But it had the effect of
subduing his tone

You dont understand he said awkwardly yet pleadingly My brother is
a fool and any woman could wind him round her finger SHE knows it
She knows he is rich and a partner in the Roanoke Ledge Thats all she
wants She is not a fit match for him Ive said he was a foolbut
hang it all thats no reason why he should marry an ignorant girla
foreigner and a servantwhen he could do better elsewhere

This would seem to be a matter between you and your brother and not
between myself and my servant said Miss Trotter coldly If you
cannot convince HIM your own brother I do not see how you expect me
to convince HER a servant over whom I have no control except as a
mistress of her WORK when on your own showing she has everything
to gain by the marriage If you wish Mr Bilson the proprietor to
threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brotherMiss
Trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the cardroom incidentit
seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage

Mr Calton looked utterly blank and hopeless His reason told him
that she was right More than that a certain admiration for her
clearsightedness began to possess him with the feeling that he would
like to have shown up a little better than he had in this interview
If Chris had fallen in love with HERbut Chris was a fool and wouldnt
have appreciated her

But you might talk with her Miss Trotter he said now completely
subdued Even if you could not reason her out of it you might find
out what she expects from this marriage If you would talk to her as
sensibly as you have to me

It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have said
Miss Trotter with a faint smile which Mr Calton thought quite pretty
but I will see about it

Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire She certainly
was in no hurry about it as she did not say anything to Frida that day
and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank
and postoffice Her way home again lay through the Summit woods It
recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to
Fridas flirtations Neither that nor Mr Bilsons presumed gallantries
however seemed inconsistent in Miss Trotters knowledge of the world
with a serious engagement with young Calton She was neither shocked nor
horrified by it and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to
speak of it to the elder Mr Calton

Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood
the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides where long
ago a girl teacher she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont
academy and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains She
smileda little sadlyas the thought occurred to her that after this
interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow
affections Should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex
never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion Young Calton
had not confessed his passion to HER nor had Frida revealed her secret
Only the elder brother had appealed to her hard practical common sense
against such sentiment Was there something in her manner that forbade
it She wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality
which had impelled her to snub the elder Calton and rebelled against
it

It was quite warm she had been walking a little faster than her usual
deliberate gait and checked herself halting in the warm breath of the
syringas Here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized
but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her
thoughts She turned quickly and beheld Chris Calton a few feet
from her panting partly from running and partly from some nervous
embarrassment His handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an
apologetic smile his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so
inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she
was divided between a laugh and serious concern

I saw yougo into the woodbut I lost you he said breathing
quickly and then when I did see you againyou were walking so fast
I had to run after you I wantedto speakto youif youll let me I
wont detain youI can walk your way

Miss Trotter was a little softened but not so much as to help him out
with his explanation She drew her neat skirts aside and made way for
him on the path beside her

You see he went on nervously taking long strides to her shorter
ones and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment my brother
Jim has been talking to you about my engagement to Frida and trying to
put you against her and me He said as much to me and added you half
promised to help him But I didnt believe himMiss TrotterI know
you wouldnt do ityou havent got it in your heart to hurt a poor
girl He says he has every confidence in youthat youre worth a dozen
such girls as she is and that Im a big fool or Id see it I dont
say youre not all he says Miss Trotter but Im not such a fool as he
thinks for I know your GOODNESS too I know how you tended me when
I was ill and how you sent Frida to comfort me You know toofor
youre a woman yourselfthat all you could say or anybody could
wouldnt separate two people who loved each other

Miss Trotter for the first time felt embarrassed and this made her a
little angry I dont think I gave your brother any right to speak
for me or of me in this matter she said icily and if you are quite
satisfied as you say you are of your own affection and Fridas I do
not see why you should care for anybodysinterference

Now you are angry with me he said in a doleful voice which at any
other time would have excited her mirth and Ive just done it Oh
Miss Trotter dont Please forgive me I didnt mean to say your talk
was no good I didnt mean to say you couldnt help us Please dont be
mad at me

He reached out his hand grasped her slim fingers in his own and
pressed them holding them and even arresting her passage The act was
without familiarity or boldness and she felt that to snatch her hand
away would be an imputation of that meaning instead of the boyish
impulse that prompted it She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue
her walk and said with a smile

Then you confess you need helpin what way

With her

Miss Trotter stared With HER she repeated This was a new idea Was
it possible that this common ignorant girl was playing and trifling
with her golden opportunity Then you are not quite sure of her she
said a little coldly

Shes so high spirited you know he said humbly and so attractive
and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things
of herwellhe threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless
despairtheres no knowing what she might do

Miss Trotters obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her
bread was buttered but remembering that the proprietor was a widower
it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on
both sides Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened
at this suggestion and there was a hardening of her face as she said
Well if YOU cant trust her perhaps your brother may be right

I dont say that Miss Trotter said Chris pleadingly yet with a
slight wincing at her words YOU could convince her if you would only
try Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself
Look Miss Trotter Ill leave it all to youthere If you will only
help me I will promise not to see hernot to go near her againuntil
you have talked with her There Even my brother would not object
to that And if he has every confidence in you Im showing you Ive
moredont you see Come now promisewont you dear Miss Trotter
He again took her hand and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim
fingers And this time she did not withdraw them Indeed it seemed to
her in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy as if a hand
had been put into her loveless past grasping and seeking hers in its
loneliness None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like
this simple weak and loving young man Perhaps it was because they
were of her own sex and she distrusted them

Nevertheless this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common
sense She looked at him fixedly for a moment and then said with a
faint smile Perhaps she does not trust YOU Perhaps you cannot trust
yourself

He felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment It was not so
much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of Miss Trotter eyes
that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color
clearness and half tender insight He dropped her hand with a newfound
timidity and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer

I mean she said stopping short in the trail at a point where a
fringe of almost impenetrable buckeyes marked the extreme edge of the
woodsI mean that you are still very young and as Frida is
nearly your own ageshe could not resist this peculiarly feminine
innuendoshe may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of
opposition she may even think my interference is a proof of it but
she added quickly to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted
look with which he was beginning to regard her I will speak to her
and she concluded playfully you must take the consequences

He said Thank you but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might
have suggested and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes Miss
Trotter did not notice it as her own eyes were at that moment fixed
upon a point on the trail a few rods away Look she said in a lower
voice I may have the opportunity now for there is Frida herself
passing Chris turned in the direction of her glance It was indeed the
young girl walking leisurely ahead of them There was no mistaking
the smart pink calico gown in which Frida was wont to array her rather
generous figure nor the long yellow braids that hung Margueritewise
down her back With the consciousness of good looks which she always
carried there was in spite of her affected ease a slight furtiveness
in the occasional swift turn of her head as if evading or seeking
observation

I will overtake her and speak to her now continued Miss Trotter I
may not have so good a chance again to see her alone You can wait here
for my return if you like

Chris started out of his abstraction Stay he stammered with a
faint tentative smile Perhapsdont you thinkI had better go
first and tell her you want to see her I can send her here You see
she mightHe stopped

Miss Trotter smiled It was part of your promise you know that you
were NOT to see her again until I had spoken But no matter Have it as
you wish I will wait here Only be quick She has just gone into the
grove

Without another word the young man turned away and she presently saw
him walking toward the pine grove into which Frida had disappeared Then
she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed and gathering
her skirts about her sat down to wait The unwonted attitude the
whole situation and the part that she seemed destined to take in this
sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint childs play out of her
lost youth and she smiled albeit with a little heightening of color
and lively brightening of her eyes Indeed as she sat there listlessly
probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol the
casual passerby might have taken herself for the heroine of some love
tryst She had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right
and left wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think
of her sylvan rendezvous and as the recollection of Chris kissing her
hand suddenly came back to her her smile became a nervous laugh and
she found herself actually blushing

But she was recalled to herself as suddenly Chris was returning He
was walking directly towards her with slow determined steps quite
different from his previous nervous agitation and as he drew nearer she
saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance his
colorful face was pale his eyes fixed and he looked ten years older
She rose quickly

I came back to tell you he said in a voice from which all trace of
his former agitation had passed that I relieve you of your promise It
wont be necessary for you to seeFrida I thank you all the same Miss
Trotter he said avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish
manner It was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for
me and to wait here and the best thing I can do is to take myself off
now and keep you no longer Please dont ask me WHY Sometime I may tell
you but not now

Then you have seen her asked Miss Trotter quickly premising Fridas
refusal from his face

He hesitated a moment then he said gravely Yes Dont ask me any
more Miss Trotter please Goodby He paused and then with a
slight uneasy glance toward the pine grove Dont let me keep you
waiting here any longer He took her hand held it lightly for a
moment and said Go now

Miss Trotter slightly bewildered and unsatisfied nevertheless passed
obediently out into the trail He gazed after her for a moment and
then turned and began rapidly to ascend the slope where he had first
overtaken her and was soon out of sight Miss Trotter continued her way
home but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned as
if taking some sudden resolution and began slowly to retrace her steps
in the direction of the pine grove What she expected to see there
possibly she could not have explained what she actually saw after a
moments waiting were the figures of Frida and Mr Bilson issuing from
the shade Her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious
importance mingled with rustic gallantry Fridas manner was also
conscious with gratified vanity and although they believed themselves
alone her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous
affectation indicative of the peasant But there was nothing to suggest
that Chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences Yet he
had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness Had
he ever suspected it before

Miss Trotter waited only until they had well preceded her and then took
a shorter cut home She was quite prepared that evening for an interview
which Mr Bilson requested She found him awkward and embarrassed in her
cool selfpossessed presence He said he deemed it his duty to inform
her of his approaching marriage with Miss Jansen but it was because he
wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in Miss
Trotters position in the hotel except to promote her to the entire
control of the establishment He was to be married in San Francisco at
once and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two indeed
he contemplated eventually retiring from business If Mr Bilson
was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid
attentions to Miss Trotter which she had ignored she never betrayed
the least recollection of it She thanked him for his confidence and
wished him happiness

Sudden as was this good fortune to Miss Trotter an independence she
had so often deservedly looked forward to she was nevertheless
keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through Chriss
disappointment and unhappiness Her sane mind taught her that it was
better for him that he had been saved an illassorted marriage that
the girl had virtually rejected him for Bilson before he had asked
her mediation that morning Yet these reasons failed to satisfy her
feelings It seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had
suddenly taken in poor Chris should end so ironically in disaster to
her sentiment and success to her material prosperity She thought of his
boyish appeal to her of what must have been his utter discomfiture in
the discovery of Fridas relations to Mr Bilson that afternoon but
more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him How
nobly and gently he had taken his loss How much more like a man he
looked in his defeat than in his passion The element of respect which
had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her
thoughts It prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and
worldly counsel it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any
other expression

As Mr Bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his
marriage he had enjoined secrecy upon her and she was also debarred
from any news of Chris through his brother who had he known of Fridas
engagement would have naturally come to her for explanation It also
convinced her that Chris himself had not revealed anything to his
brother


III

When the news of the marriage reached Buckeye Hill it did not however
make much scandal owing possibly to the scant number of the sex
who are apt to disseminate it and to many the name of Miss Jansen was
unknown The intelligence that Mr Bilson would be absent for a year
and that the superior control of the Summit Hotel would devolve upon
Miss Trotter DID however create a stir in that practical business
community No one doubted the wisdom of the selection Every one knew
that to Miss Trotters tact and intellect the success of the hotel had
been mainly due Possibly the satisfaction of Buckeye Hill was due to
something else Slowly and insensibly Miss Trotter had achieved a social
distinction the wives and daughters of the banker the lawyer and the
pastor had made much of her and now as an independent woman of means
she stood first in the district Guests deemed it an honor to have a
personal interview with her The governor of the State and the Supreme
Court judges treated her like a private hostess middleaged Miss
Trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress
in California The old romantic fiction of her past was revived
againthey had known she was a real lady from the first She
received these attentions as became her sane intellect and cool
temperament without pride affectation or hesitation Only her dark
eyes brightened on the day when Mr Bilsons marriage was made known
and she was called upon by James Calton

I did you a great injustice he said with a smile

I dont understand you she replied a little coldly

Why this woman and her marriage he said you must have known
something of it all the time and perhaps helped it along to save
Chris

You are mistaken returned Miss Trotter truthfully I knew nothing of
Mr Bilsons intentions

Then I have wronged you still more he said briskly for I thought at
first that you were inclined to help Chris in his foolishness Now I see
it was your persuasions that changed him

Let me tell you once for all Mr Calton she returned with an
impulsive heat which she regretted that I did not interfere in any way
with your brothers suit He spoke to me of it and I promised to see
Frida but he afterwards asked me not to I know nothing of the matter

Well laughed Mr Calton WHATEVER you did it was most efficacious
and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered
his high opinion of you if indeed he hasnt really transferred his
affections to you

Luckily Miss Trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of
the sentence or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly
came to her cheek and eyes Yet for an instant this calm collected
woman trembled not at what Mr Calton might have noticed but at what
SHE had noticed in HERSELF Mr Calton construing her silence and
averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech continued
hurriedly

I mean dont you see that I believe no other woman could have
influenced my brother as you have

You mean I think that he has taken his broken heart very lightly
said Miss Trotter with a bitter little laugh so unlike herself that
Mr Calton was quite concerned at it

No he said gravely I cant say THAT Hes regularly cut up you
know And changed youd hardly know him More like a gloomy crank than
the easy fool he used to be he went on with brotherly directness It
wouldnt be a bad thing you know if you could manage to see him Miss
Trotter In fact as hes off his feed and has some trouble with his
arm again owing to all this I reckon Ive been thinking of advising
him to come up to the hotel once more till hes better So long as SHES
gone it would be all right you know

By this time Miss Trotter was herself again She reasoned or thought
she did that this was a question of the business of the hotel and
it was clearly her duty to assent to Chriss coming The strange yet
pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored
completely

He came the next day Luckily she was so much shocked by the change in
his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the
meeting His face had lost its fresh color and round outline the lines
of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache
his eyes which had sought hers with a singular seriousness no longer
wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her
but were filled with an older experience Indeed he seemed to have
approximated so near to her own age that by one of those paradoxes of
the emotions she felt herself much younger and in smile and eye showed
it at which he colored faintly But she kept her sympathy and inquiries
limited to his physical health and made no allusion to his past
experiences indeed ignoring any connection between the two He had
been shockingly careless in his convalescence had had a relapse in
consequence and deserved a good scolding His relapse was a reflection
upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure She should treat him
more severely now and allow him no indulgences I do not know that
Miss Trotter intended anything covert but their eyes met and he colored
again Ignoring this also and promising to look after him occasionally
she quietly withdrew

But about this time it was noticed that a change took place in Miss
Trotter Always scrupulously correct and even severe in her dress she
allowed herself certain privileges of color style and material She
who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars
came out in delicate tints and laces which lent a brilliancy to her
dark eyes and short crisp black curls slightly tinged with gray
One warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white
possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the Vermont academy The
masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive even the women
forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity
and new condition but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age
For all that Miss Trotter had never looked so charming and the faint
autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer

One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on
the balcony but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to
overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask
him to come into her own little drawingroom ostensibly to avoid the
cool night air It was the former cardroom of the hotel but now
fitted with feminine taste and prettiness She arranged a seat for him
on the sofa which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness the
last vestige of his youth

Its very kind of you to invite me in here he began bitterly when
you are so run after by every one and to leave Judge Fletcher just
now to talk to me but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a
fool

I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on
the balcony and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of
himself she returned with the faintest touch of coquetry and a smile
which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself
as anything else

And Im a baby who cant he said angrily After a pause he burst out
abruptly Miss Trotter will you answer me one question

Go on she said smilingly

Did you knowthatwoman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in
the wood

No she answered quickly but without the sharp resentment she had
shown at his brothers suggestion I only knew it when Mr Bilson told
me the same evening

And I only knew it when news came of their marriage he said bitterly

But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the
wood she responded

When I saw them together in the wood he repeated dazedly

Miss Trotter was startled and stopped short Was it possible he had not
seen them together She was shocked that she had spoken but it was too
late to withdraw her words Yes she went on hurriedly I thought
that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her

He looked at her fixedly and said slowly You thought that Well
listen to me I saw NO ONE I knew nothing of this I suspected nothing
I returned before I had reached the woodbecausebecauseI had
changed my mind

Changed your mind she repeated wonderingly

Yes Changed my mind I couldnt stand it any longer I did not love
the girlI never loved herI was sick of my folly Sick of deceiving
you and myself any longer Now you know why I didnt go into the wood
and why I didnt care where she was nor who was with her

I dont understand she said lifting her clear eyes to his coldly

Of course you dont he said bitterly I didnt understand myself
And when you do understand you will hate and despise meif you do not
laugh at me for a conceited fool Hear me out Miss Trotter for I am
speaking the truth to you now if I never spoke it before I never asked
the girl to marry me I never said to HER half what I told to YOU and
when I asked you to intercede with her I never wanted you to do itand
never expected you would

May I ask WHY you did it then said Miss Trotter with an acerbity
which she put on to hide a vague tantalizing consciousness

You would not believe me if I told you and you would hate me if you
did He stopped and locking his fingers together threw his hands
over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her You never liked me
Miss Trotter he said more quietly not from the first From the day
that I was brought to the hotel when you came to see me I could see
that you looked upon me as a foolish petted boy When I tried to catch
your eye you looked at the doctor and took your speech from him And
yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were
and whose sympathy I longed so much to have You may not believe me but
I thought you were a queen for you were the first lady I had ever seen
and you were so different from the other girls I knew or the women who
had been kind to me You may laugh but its the truth Im telling you
Miss Trotter

He had relapsed completely into his old pleading boyish wayit had
struck her even as he had pleaded to her for Frida

I knew you didnt like me that day you came to change the bandages
Although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain you did it so
coldly and precisely and although I longed to keep you there with me
you scarcely waited to take my thanks but left me as if you had
only done your duty to a stranger And worst of all he went on more
bitterly the doctor knew it tooguessed how I felt toward you and
laughed at me for my hopelessness That made me desperate and put me up
to act the fool I did Yes Miss Trotter I thought it mighty clever
to appear to be in love with Frida and to get him to ask to have her
attend me regularly And when you simply consented without a word or
thought about it and me I knew I was nothing to you

Miss Trotter felt a sudden thrill The recollection of Dr Duchesnes
strange scrutiny of her of her own mistake which she now knew might
have been the truthflashed across her confused consciousness in swift
corroboration of his words It was a DOUBLE revelation to her for what
else was the meaning of this subtle insidious benumbing sweetness that
was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast She
felt she ought to listen no longerto speakto say somethingto get
upto turn and confront him coldlybut she was powerless Her reason
told her that she had been the victim of a trickthat having deceived
her once he might be doing so again but she could not break the spell
that was upon her nor did she want to She must know the culmination of
this confession whose preamble thrilled her so strangely

The girl was kind and sympathetic he went on but I was not so great
a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention
I suppose it was in my desperation that I told my brother thinking he
would tell you as he did He would not tell me what you said to him
except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that I was only
flirting with Frida Then I resolved to speak with you myselfand I
did I know it was a stupid clumsy contrivance It never seemed so
stupid before I spoke to you It never seemed so wicked as when you
promised to help me and your eyes shone on me for the first time with
kindness And it never seemed so hopeless as when I found you touched
with my love for another You wonder why I kept up this deceit until you
promised Well I had prepared the bitter cup myselfI thought I ought
to drink it to the dregs

She turned quietly passionately and standing up faced him with a
little cry Why are you telling me this NOW

He rose too and catching her hands in his said with a white face
Because I love you



Half an hour later when the underhousekeeper was summoned to receive
Miss Trotters orders she found that lady quietly writing at the table
Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr Caltons
rooms would be vacated the next day When the servant who like most of
her class was devoted to the goodnatured goodlooking liberal Chris
asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better Miss
Trotter with equal placidity answered that it was his intention to put
himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco and that
she Miss Trotter fully approved of his course She finished her
letterthe servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr Bilson at
Parisand handing it to her bade that it should be given to a groom
with orders to ride over to the Summit postoffice at once to catch the
last post As the housekeeper turned to go she again referred to the
departing guest It seems such a pity maam that Mr Calton couldnt
stay as he always said you did him so much good Miss Trotter smiled
affably But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh
and then dropping her handsome graystreaked head in her slim hands
cried like a girlor indeed as she had never cried when a girl

When the news of Mr Caltons departure became known the next day some
lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor
Miss Trotter agreed with them with the consoling suggestion that he
might return for a day or two He did return for a day it was thought
that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him though some
believed he would be an invalid all his life

Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties with the
difference perhaps that she became daily more socially popular and
perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine
guests It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a
serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand When three months later
some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr Bilson was
returning to take charge of his hotel owing to the resignation of Miss
Trotter who needed a complete change everybody knew what that meant
A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs Boompointer
others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim
finger

Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither and by the time Mr and Mrs
Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday and the Summit House knew
her no more

Three years later and at a foreign Spa thousands of miles distant from
the scene of her former triumphs Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome
stately grayhaired stranger whose aristocratic bearing deeply
impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival and
believed her to be a grand duchess at the least They were still
more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the
wellknown Baroness X and afterwards engaged in a very confidential
conversation with that lady But they would have been still more
surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation

I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now said the
baroness critically But there are a few of your compatriots here
however and they are always amusing You see that somewhat faded blonde
sitting quite alone in that arbor That is her position day after day
while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women
here Quite the opposite experience one has of American women where
its all the other way is it not And there is an odd story about her
which may account for if it does not excuse her husbands neglect
Theyre very rich but they say she was originally a mere servant in a
hotel

You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one said
Miss Trotter smiling

Nonsense I mean that this woman was a mere peasant and frightfully
ignorant at that

Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass and after a moments scrutiny
said gently I think you are a little severe I know her its a Mrs
Bilson

No my dear You are quite wrong That was the name of her FIRST
husband I am told she was a widow who married againquite a
fascinating young man and evidently her superiorthat is what is so
funny She is a Mrs CaltonMrs Chris Calton as she calls herself

Is her husbandMr Caltonhere said Miss Trotter after a pause in
a still gentler voice

Naturally not He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to
the Schwartzberg He returns tomorrow You will find HER very stupid
but HE is very jolly though a little spoiled by women Why do we always
spoil them

Miss Trotter smiled and presently turned the subject But the baroness
was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected
telegram had obliged Miss Trotter to leave the Spa without meeting the
Caltons
