 ENOCH ARDEN




 Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm
 And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands
 Beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf
 In cluster then a moulderd church and higher
 A long street climbs to one talltowerd mill
 And high in heaven behind it a gray down
 With Danish barrows and a hazelwood
 By autumn nutters haunted flourishes
 Green in a cuplike hollow of the down

 Here on this beach a hundred years ago
 Three children of three houses Annie Lee
 The prettiest little damsel in the port
 And Philip Ray the millers only son
 And Enoch Arden a rough sailors lad
 Made orphan by a winter shipwreck playd
 Among the waste and lumber of the shore
 Hard coils of cordage swarthy fishingnets
 Anchors of rusty fluke and boats updrawn
 And built their castles of dissolving sand
 To watch them overflowd or following up
 And flying the white breaker daily left
 The little footprint daily washd away

 A narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff
 In this the children playd at keeping house
 Enoch was host one day Philip the next
 While Annie still was mistress but at times
 Enoch would hold possession for a week
 This is my house and this my little wife
 Mine too said Philip turn and turn about
 When if they quarrelld Enoch strongermade
 Was master then would Philip his blue eyes
 All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears
 Shriek out I hate you Enoch and at this
 The little wife would weep for company
 And pray them not to quarrel for her sake
 And say she would be little wife to both

 But when the dawn of rosy childhood past
 And the new warmth of lifes ascending sun
 Was felt by either either fixt his heart
 On that one girl and Enoch spoke his love
 But Philip loved in silence and the girl
 Seemd kinder unto Philip than to him
 But she loved Enoch tho she knew it not
 And would if askd deny it Enoch set
 A purpose evermore before his eyes
 To hoard all savings to the uttermost
 To purchase his own boat and make a home
 For Annie and so prosperd that at last
 A luckier or a bolder fisherman
 A carefuller in peril did not breathe
 For leagues along that breakerbeaten coast
 Than Enoch Likewise had he served a year
 On board a merchantman and made himself
 Full sailor and he thrice had pluckd a life
 From the dread sweep of the downstreaming seas
 And all me lookd upon him favorably
 And ere he touchd his oneandtwentieth May
 He purchased his own boat and made a home
 For Annie neat and nestlike halfway up
 The narrow street that clamberd toward the mill

 Then on a golden autumn eventide
 The younger people making holiday
 With bag and sack and basket great and small
 Went nutting to the hazels Philip stayd
 His father lying sick and needing him
 An hour behind but as he climbd the hill
 Just where the prone edge of the wood began
 To feather toward the hollow saw the pair
 Enoch and Annie sitting handinhand
 His large gray eyes and weatherbeaten face
 Allkindled by a still and sacred fire
 That burnd as on an altar Philip lookd
 And in their eyes and faces read his doom
 Then as their faces drew together groand
 And slipt aside and like a wounded life
 Crept down into the hollows of the wood
 There while the rest were loud in merrymaking
 Had his dark hour unseen and rose and past
 Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart

 So these were wed and merrily rang the bells
 And merrily ran the years seven happy years
 Seven happy years of health and competence
 And mutual love and honorable toil
 With children first a daughter In him woke
 With his first babes first cry the noble wish
 To save all earnings to the uttermost
 And give his child a better bringingup
 Than his had been or hers a wish renewd
 When two years after came a boy to be
 The rosy idol of her solitudes
 While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas
 Or often journeying landward for in truth
 Enochs white horse and Enochs oceanspoil
 In oceansmelling osier and his face
 Roughreddend with a thousand winter gales
 Not only to the marketcross were known
 But in the leafy lanes behind the down
 Far as the portalwarding lionwhelp
 And peacockyewtree of the lonely Hall
 Whose Friday fare was Enochs ministering

 Then came a change as all things human change
 Ten miles to northward of the narrow port
 Opend a larger haven thither used
 Enoch at times to go by land or sea
 And once when there and clambering on a mast
 In harbor by mischance he slipt and fell
 A limb was broken when they lifted him
 And while he lay recovering there his wife
 Bore him another son a sickly one
 Another hand crept too across his trade
 Taking her bread and theirs and on him fell
 Altho a grave and staid Godfearing man
 Yet lying thus inactive doubt and gloom
 He seemd as in a nightmare of the night
 To see his children leading evermore
 Low miserable lives of handtomouth
 And her he loved a beggar then he prayd
 Save them from this whatever comes to me
 And while he prayd the master of that ship
 Enoch had served in hearing his mischance
 Came for he knew the man and valued him
 Reporting of his vessel Chinabound
 And wanting yet a boatswain Would he go
 There yet were many weeks before she saild
 Saild from this port Would Enoch have the place
 And Enoch all at once assented to it
 Rejoicing at that answer to his prayer

 So now that the shadow of mischance appeard
 No graver than as when some little cloud
 Cuts off the fiery highway of the sun
 And isles a light in the offing yet the wife
 When he was gonethe childrenwhat to do
 Then Enoch lay longpondering on his plans
 To sell the boatand yet he loved her well
 How many a rough sea had he weatherd in her
 He knew her as a horseman knows his horse
 And yet to sell herthen with what she brought
 Buy goods and storesset Annie forth in trade
 With all that seamen needed or their wives
 So might she keep the house while he was gone
 Should he not trade himself out yonder go
 This voyage more than once yea twice or thrice
 As oft as neededlast returning rich
 Become the master of a larger craft
 With fuller profits lead an easier life
 Have all his pretty young ones educated
 And pass his days in peace among his own

 Thus Enoch in his heart determined all
 Then moving homeward came on Annie pale
 Nursing the sickly babe her latestborn
 Forward she started with a happy cry
 And laid the feeble infant in his arms
 Whom Enoch took and handled all his limbs
 Appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike
 But had no heart to break his purposes
 To Annie till the morrow when he spoke

 Then first since Enochs golden ring had girt
 Her finger Annie fought against his will
 Yet not with brawling opposition she
 But manifold entreaties many a tear
 Many a sad kiss by day and night renewd
 Sure that all evil would come out of it
 Besought him supplicating if he cared
 For here or his dear children not to go
 He not for his own self caring but her
 Her and her children let her plead in vain
 So grieving held his will and bore it thro

 For Enoch parted with his old seafriend
 Bought Annie goods and stores and set his hand
 To fit their little streetward sittingroom
 With shelf and corner for the goods and stores
 So all day long till Enochs last at home
 Shaking their pretty cabin hammer and axe
 Auger and saw while Annie seemd to hear
 Her own deathscaffold raising shrilld and rang
 Till this was ended and his careful hand
 The space was narrowhaving orderd all
 Almost as neat and close as Nature packs
 Her blossom or her seedling paused and he
 Who needs would work for Annie to the last
 Ascending tired heavily slept till morn

 And Enoch faced this morning of farewell
 Brightly and boldly All his Annies fears
 Save as his Annies were a laughter to him
 Yet Enoch as a brave Godfearing man
 Bowd himself down and in that mystery
 Where Godinman is one with maninGod
 Prayd for a blessing on his wife and babes
 Whatever came to him and then he said
 Annie this voyage by the grace of God
 Will bring fair weather yet to all of us
 Keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me
 For Ill be back my girl before you know it
 Then lightly rocking babys cradle and he
 This pretty puny weakly little one
 Nayfor I love him all the better for it
 God bless him he shall sit upon my knees
 And I will tell him tales of foreign parts
 And make him merry when I come home again
 Come Annie come cheer up before I go

 Him running on thus hopefully she heard
 And almost hoped herself but when he turnd
 The current of his talk to graver things
 In sailor fashion roughly sermonizing
 On providence and trust in Heaven she heard
 Heard and not heard him as the village girl
 Who sets her pitcher underneath the spring
 Musing on him that used to fill it for her
 Hears and not hears and lets it overflow

 At length she spoke O Enoch you are wise
 And yet for all your wisdom well know I
 That I shall look upon your face no more

 Well then said Enoch I shall look on yours
 Annie the ship I sail in passes here
 He named the day get you a seamans glass
 Spy out my face and laugh at all your fears

 But when the last of those last moments came
 Annie my girl cheer up be comforted
 Look to the babes and till I come again
 Keep everything shipshape for I must go
 And fear no more for me or if you fear
 Cast all your cares on God that anchor holds
 Is He not yonder in those uttermost
 Parts of the morning if I flee to these
 Can I go from Him and the sea is His
 The sea is His He made it

 Enoch rose
 Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife
 And kissd his wonderstricken little ones
 But for the third sickly one who slept
 After a night of feverous wakefulness
 When Annie would have raised him Enoch said
 Wake him not let him sleep how should this child
 Remember this and kissed him in his cot
 But Annie from her babys forehead clipt
 A tiny curl and gave it this he kept
 Thro all his future but now hastily caught
 His bundle waved his hand and went his way

 She when the day that Enoch mentiond came
 Borrowd a glass but all in vain perhaps
 She could not fix the glass to suit her eye
 Perhaps her eye was dim hand tremulous
 She saw him not and while he stood on deck
 Waving the moment and the vessel past

 Evn to the last dip of the vanishing sail
 She watchd it and departed weeping for him
 Then tho she mournd his absence as his grave
 Set her sad will no less to chime with his
 But throve not in her trade not being bred
 To barter nor compensating the want
 By shrewdness neither capable of lies
 Nor asking overmuch and taking less
 And still foreboding what would Enoch say
 For more than once in days of difficulty
 And pressure had she sold her wares for less
 Than what she gave in buying what she sold
 She faild and saddend knowing it and thus
 Expectant of that news that never came
 Gaind for here own a scanty sustenance
 And lived a life of silent melancholy

 Now the third child was sicklyborn and grew
 Yet sicklier tho the mother cared for it
 With all a mothers care nevertheless
 Whether her business often calld her from it
 Or thro the want of what it needed most
 Or means to pay the voice who best could tell
 What most it neededhowsoeer it was
 After a lingeringere she was aware
 Like the caged bird escaping suddenly
 The little innocent soul flitted away

 In that same week when Annie buried it
 Philips true heart which hungerd for her peace
 Since Enoch left he had not lookd upon her
 Smote him as having kept aloof so long
 Surely said Philip I may see her now
 May be some little comfort therefore went
 Past thro the solitary room in front
 Paused for a moment at an inner door
 Then struck it thrice and no one opening
 Enterd but Annie seated with her grief
 Fresh from the burial of her little one
 Cared not to look on any human face
 But turnd her own toward the wall and wept
 Then Philip standing up said falteringly
 Annie I came to ask a favor of you

 He spoke the passion in her moand reply
 Favor from one so sad and so forlorn
 As I am half abashd him yet unaskd
 His bashfulness and tenderness at war
 He set himself beside her saying to her

 I came to speak to you of what he wishd
 Enoch your husband I have ever said
 You chose the best among usa strong man
 For where he fixt his heart he set his hand
 To do the thing he willd and bore it thro
 And wherefore did he go this weary way
 And leave you lonely not to see the world
 For pleasurenay but for the wherewithal
 To give his babes a better bringingup
 Than his had been or yours that was his wish
 And if he come again vext will he be
 To find the precious morning hours were lost
 And it would vex him even in his grave
 If he could know his babes were running wild
 Like colts about the waste So Annie now
 Have we not known each other all our lives
 I do beseech you by the love you bear
 Him and his children not to say me nay
 For if you will when Enoch comes again
 Why then he shall repay meif you will
 Anniefor I am rich and welltodo
 Now let me put the boy and girl to school
 This is the favor that I came to ask

 Then Annie with her brows against the wall
 Answerd I cannot look you in the face
 I seem so foolish and so broken down
 When you came in my sorrow broke me down
 And now I think your kindness breaks me down
 But Enoch lives that is borne in on me
 He will repay you money can be repaid
 Not kindness such as yours

 And Philip askd
 Then you will let me Annie

 There she turnd
 She rose and fixt her swimming eyes upon him
 And dwelt a moment on his kindly face
 Then calling down a blessing on his head
 Caught at his hand and wrung it passionately
 And past into the little garth beyond
 So lifted up in spirit he moved away

 Then Philip put the boy and girl to school
 And bought them needful books and everyway
 Like one who does his duty by his own
 Made himself theirs and tho for Annies sake
 Fearing the lazy gossip of the port
 He oft denied his heart his dearest wish
 And seldom crost her threshold yet he sent
 Gifts by the children gardenherbs and fruit
 The late and early roses from his wall
 Or conies from the down and now and then
 With some pretext of fineness in the meal
 To save the offence of charitable flour
 From his tall mill that whistled on the waste

 But Philip did not fathom Annies mind
 Scarce could the woman when he came upon her
 Out of full heart and boundless gratitude
 Light on a broken word to thank him with
 But Philip was her childrens allinall
 From distant corners of the street they ran
 To greet his hearty welcome heartily
 Lords of his house and of his mill were they
 Worried his passive ear with petty wrongs
 Or pleasures hung upon him playd with him
 And calld him Father Philip Philip gaind
 As Enoch lost for Enoch seemd to them
 Uncertain as a vision or a dream
 Faint as a figure seen in early dawn
 Down at the far end of an avenue
 Going we know not where and so ten years
 Since Enoch left his hearth and native land
 Fled forward and no news of Enoch came

 It chanced one evening Annies children longd
 To go with others nutting to the wood
 And Annie would go with them then they beggd
 For Father Philip as they calld him too
 Him like the working bee in blossomdust
 Blanchd with his mill they found and saying to him
 Come with us Father Philip he denied
 But when the children pluckd at him to go
 He laughd and yielding readily to their wish
 For was not Annie with them and they went

 But after scaling half the weary down
 Just where the prone edge of the wood began
 To feather toward the hollow all her force
 Faild her and sighing let me rest she said
 So Philip rested with her wellcontent
 While all the younger ones with jubilant cries
 Broke from their elders and tumultuously
 Down thro the whitening hazels made a plunge
 To the bottom and dispersed and beat or broke
 The lithe reluctant boughs to tear away
 Their tawny clusters crying to each other
 And calling here and there about the wood

 But Philip sitting at her side forgot
 Her presence and rememberd one dark hour
 Here in this wood when like a wounded life
 He crept into the shadow at last he said
 Lifting his honest forehead Listen Annie
 How merry they are down yonder in the wood
 Tired Annie for she did not speak a word
 Tired but her face had falln upon her hands
 At which as with a kind anger in him
 The ship was lost he said the ship was lost
 No more of that why should you kill yourself
 And make them orphans quite And Annie said
 I thought not of it butI known not why
 Their voices make me feel so solitary

 Then Philip coming somewhat closer spoke
 Annie there is a thing upon my mind
 And it has been upon my mind so long
 That tho I know not when it first came there
 I know that it will out at last O Annie
 It is beyond all hope against all chance
 That he who left you ten long years ago
 Should still be living well thenlet me speak
 I grieve to see you poor and wanting help
 I cannot help you as I wish to do
 Unlessthey say that women are so quick
 Perhaps you know what I would have you know
 I wish you for my wife I fain would prove
 A father to your children I do think
 They love me as a father I am sure
 That I love them as if they were mine own
 And I believe if you were fast my wife
 That after all these sad uncertain years
 We might be still as happy as God grants
 To any of His creatures Think upon it
 For I am welltodono kin no care
 No burthen save my care for you and yours
 And we have known each other all our lives
 And I have loved you longer than you know

 Then answerd Annie tenderly she spoke
 You have been as Gods good angel in our house
 God bless you for it God reward you for it
 Philip with something happier than myself
 Can one live twice can you be ever loved
 As Enoch was what is it that you ask
 I am content he answerd to be loved
 A little after Enoch O she cried
 Scared as it were dear Philip wait a while
 If Enoch comesbut Enoch will not come
 Yet wait a year a year is not so long
 Surely I shall be wiser in a year
 O wait a little Philip sadly said
 Annie as I have waited all my life
 I well may wait a little Nay she cried
 I am bound you have my promisein a year
 Will you not bide your year as I bide mine
 And Philip answerd I will bide my year

 Here both were mute till Philip glancing up
 Beheld the dead flame of the fallen day
 Pass from the Danish barrow overhead
 Then fearing night and chill for Annie rose
 And sent his voice beneath him thro the wood
 Up came the children laden with their spoil
 Then all descended to the port and there
 At Annies door he paused and gave his hand
 Saying gently Annie when I spoke to you
 That was your hour of weakness I was wrong
 I am always bound to you but you are free
 Then Annie weeping answerd I am bound

 She spoke and in one moment as it were
 While yet she went about her household ways
 Evn as she dwelt upon his latest words
 That he had loved her longer than she knew
 That autumn into autumn flashd again
 And there he stood once more before her face
 Claiming her promise Is it a year she askd
 Yes if the nuts he said be ripe again
 Come out and see But sheshe put him off
 So much to look tosuch a changea month
 Give her a monthshe knew that she was bound
 A monthno more Then Philip with his eyes
 Full of that lifelong hunger and his voice
 Shaking a little like a drunkards hand
 Take your own time Annie take your own time
 And Annie could have wept for pity of him
 And yet she held him on delayingly
 With many a scarcebelievable excuse
 Trying his truth and his longsufferance
 Till halfanother year had slipt away

 By this the lazy gossips of the port
 Abhorrent of a calculation crost
 Began to chafe as at a personal wrong
 Some thought that Philip did but trifle with her
 Some that she but held off to draw him on
 And others laughd at her and Philip too
 As simple folks that knew not their own minds
 And one in whom all evil fancies clung
 Like serpent eggs together laughingly
 Would hint a worse in either Her own son
 Was silent tho he often lookd his wish
 But evermore the daughter prest upon her
 To wed the man so dear to all of them
 And lift the household out of poverty
 And Philips rosy face contracting grew
 Careworn and wan and all these things fell on her
 Sharp as reproach

 At last one night it chanced
 That Annie could not sleep but earnestly
 Prayd for a sign my Enoch is he gone
 Then compassd round by the blind wall of night
 Brookd not the expectant terror of her heart
 Started from bed and struck herself a light
 Then desperately seized the holy Book
 Suddenly set it wide to find a sign
 Suddenly put her finger on the text
 Under a palmtree That was nothing to her
 No meaning there she closed the book and slept
 When lo her Enoch sitting on a height
 Under a palmtree over him the Sun
 He is gone she thought he is happy he is singing
 Hosanna in the highest yonder shines
 The Sun of Righteousness and these be palms
 Whereof the happy people strowing cried
 Hosanna in the highest Here she woke
 Resolved sent for him and said wildly to him
 There is no reason why we should not wed
 Then for Gods sake he answerd both our sakes
 So you will wed me let it be at once

 So these were wed and merrily rang the bells
 Merrily rang the bells and they were wed
 But never merrily beat Annies heart
 A footstep seemd to fall beside her path
 She knew not whence a whisper in her ear
 She knew not what nor loved she to be left
 Alone at home nor ventured out alone
 What aild her then that ere she enterd often
 Her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch
 Fearing to enter Philip thought he knew
 Such doubts and fears were common to her state
 Being with child but when her child was born
 Then her new child was as herself renewd
 Then the new mother came about her heart
 Then her good Philip was her allinall
 And that mysterious instinct wholly died

 And where was Enoch prosperously saild
 The ship Good Fortune tho at setting forth
 The Biscay roughly ridging eastward shook
 And almost overwhelmd her yet unvext
 She slipt across the summer of the world
 Then after a long tumble about the Cape
 And frequent interchange of foul and fair
 She passing thro the summer world again
 The breath of heaven came continually
 And sent her sweetly by the golden isles
 Till silent in her oriental haven

 There Enoch traded for himself and bought
 Quaint monsters for the market of those times
 A gilded dragon also for the babes

 Less lucky her homevoyage at first indeed
 Thro many a fair seacircle day by day
 Scarcerocking her fullbusted figurehead
 Stared oer the ripple feathering from her bows
 Then followd calms and then winds variable
 Then baffling a long course of them and last
 Storm such as drove her under moonless heavens
 Till hard upon the cry of breakers came
 The crash of ruin and the loss of all
 But Enoch and two others Half the night
 Buoyd upon floating tackle and broken spars
 These drifted stranding on an isle at morn
 Rich but loneliest in a lonely sea

 No want was there of human sustenance
 Soft fruitage mighty nuts and nourishing roots
 Nor save for pity was it hard to take
 The helpless life so wild that it was tame
 There in a seawardgazing mountaingorge
 They built and thatchd with leaves of palm a hut
 Half hut half native cavern So the three
 Set in this Eden of all plenteousness
 Dwelt with eternal summer illcontent

 For one the youngest hardly more than boy
 Hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck
 Lay lingering out a threeyears deathinlife
 They could not leave him After he was gone
 The two remaining found a fallen stem
 And Enochs comrade careless of himself
 Firehollowing this in Indian fashion fell
 Sunstricken and that other lived alone
 In those two deaths he read Gods warning wait

 The mountain wooded to the peak the lawns
 And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven
 The slender cocos drooping crown of plumes
 The lightning flash of insect and of bird
 The lustre of the long convolvuluses
 That coild around the stately stems and ran
 Evn to the limit of the land the glows
 And glories of the broad belt of the world
 All these he saw but what he fain had seen
 He could not see the kindly human face
 Nor ever hear a kindly voice but heard
 The myriad shriek of wheeling oceanfowl
 The leaguelong roller thundering on the reef
 The moving whisper of huge trees that branchd
 And blossomd in the zenith or the sweep
 Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave
 As down the shore he ranged or all day long
 Sat often in the seawardgazing gorge
 A shipwreckd sailor waiting for a sail
 No sail from day to day but every day
 The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
 Among the palms and ferns and precipices
 The blaze upon the waters to the east
 The blaze upon his island overhead
 The blaze upon the waters to the west
 Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven
 The hollowerbellowing ocean and again
 The scarlet shafts of sunrisebut no sail

 There often as he watchd or seemd to watch
 So still the golden lizard on him paused
 A phantom made of many phantoms moved
 Before him haunting him or he himself
 Moved haunting people things and places known
 Far in a darker isle beyond the line
 The babes their babble Annie the small house
 The climbing street the mill the leafy lanes
 The peacockyewtree and the lonely Hall
 The horse he drove the boat he sold the chill
 November dawns and dewyglooming downs
 The gentle shower the smell of dying leaves
 And the low moan of leadencolord seas

 Once likewise in the ringing of his ears
 Tho faintly merrilyfar and far away
 He heard the pealing of his parish bells
 Then tho he knew not wherefore started up
 Shuddering and when the beauteous hateful isle
 Returnd upon him had not his poor heart
 Spoken with That which being everywhere
 Lets none who speaks with Him seem all alone
 Surely the man had died of solitude

 Thus over Enochs earlysilvering head
 The sunny and rainy seasons came and went
 Year after year His hopes to see his own
 And pace the sacred old familiar fields
 Not yet had perishd when his lonely doom
 Came suddenly to an end Another ship
 She wanted water blown by baffling winds
 Like the Good Fortune from her destined course
 Stayd by this isle not knowing where she lay
 For since the mate had seen at early dawn
 Across a break on the mistwreathen isle
 The silent water slipping from the hills
 They sent a crew that landing burst away
 In search of stream or fount and filld the shores
 With clamor Downward from his mountain gorge
 Stept the longhaird longbearded solitary
 Brown looking hardly human strangely clad
 Muttering and mumbling idiotlike it seemd
 With inarticulate rage and making signs
 They knew not what and yet he led the way
 To where the rivulets of sweet water ran
 And ever as he mingled with the crew
 And heard them talking his longbounden tongue
 Was loosend till he made them understand
 Whom when their casks were filld they took aboard
 And there the tale he utterd brokenly
 Scarce credited at first but more and more
 Amazed and melted all who listend to it
 And clothes they gave him and free passage home
 But oft he workd among the rest and shook
 His isolation from him None of these
 Came from his county or could answer him
 If questiond aught of what he cared to know
 And dull the voyage was with long delays
 The vessel scarce seaworthy but evermore
 His fancy fled before the lazy wind
 Returning till beneath a clouded moon
 He like a lover down thro all his blood
 Drew in the dewy meadowy morningbreath
 Of England blown across her ghostly wall
 And that same morning officers and men
 Levied a kindly tax upon themselves
 Pitying the lonely man and gave him it
 Then moving up the coast they landed him
 Evn in that harbor whence he saild before

 There Enoch spoke no word to anyone
 But homewardhomewhat home had he a home
 His home he walkd Bright was that afternoon
 Sunny but chill till drawn thro either chasm
 Where either haven opend on the deeps
 Rolld a seahaze and whelmd the world in gray
 Cut off the length of highway on before
 And left but narrow breadth to left and right
 Of witherd holt or tilth or pasturage
 On the nighnaked tree the Robin piped
 Disconsolate and thro the dripping haze
 The dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down
 Thicker the drizzle grew deeper the gloom
 Last as it seemd a great mistblotted light
 Flared on him and he came upon the place

 Then down the long street having slowly stolen
 His heart foreshadowing all calamity
 His eyes upon the stones he reachd the home
 Where Annie lived and loved him and his babes
 In those faroff seven happy years were born
 But finding neither light nor murmur there
 A bill of sale gleamd thro the drizzle crept
 Still downward thinking dead or dead to me

 Down to the pool and narrow wharf he went
 Seeking a tavern which of old he knew
 A front of timbercrost antiquity
 So propt wormeaten ruinously old
 He thought it must have gone but he was gone
 Who kept it and his widow Miriam Lane
 With dailydwindling profits held the house
 A haunt of brawling seamen once but now
 Stiller with yet a bed for wandering men
 There Enoch rested silently many days

 But Miriam Lane was good and garrulous
 Nor let him be but often breaking in
 Told him with other annals of the port
 Not knowingEnoch was so brown so bowd
 So brokenall the story of his house
 His babys death her growing poverty
 How Philip put her little ones to school
 And kept them in it his long wooing her
 Her slow consent and marriage and the birth
 Of Philips child and oer his countenance
 No shadow past nor motion anyone
 Regarding well had deemd he felt the tale
 Less than the teller only when she closed
 Enoch poor man was cast away and lost
 He shaking his gray head pathetically
 Repeated muttering cast away and lost
 Again in deeper inward whispers lost

 But Enoch yearnd to see her face again
 If I might look on her sweet face gain
 And know that she is happy So the thought
 Haunted and harassd him and drove him forth
 At evening when the dull November day
 Was growing duller twilight to the hill
 There he sat down gazing on all below
 There did a thousand memories roll upon him
 Unspeakable for sadness By and by
 The ruddy square of comfortable light
 Farblazing from the rear of Philips house
 Allured him as the beaconblaze allures
 The bird of passage till he madly strikes
 Against it and beats out his weary life

 For Philips dwelling fronted on the street
 The latest house to landward but behind
 With one small gate that opend on the waste
 Flourishd a little garden square and walld
 And in it throve an ancient evergreen
 A yewtree and all round it ran a walk
 Of shingle and a walk divided it
 But Enoch shunnd the middle walk and stole
 Up by the wall behind the yew and thence
 That which he better might have shunnd if griefs
 Like his have worse or better Enoch saw

 For cups and silver on the burnishd board
 Sparkled and shone so genial was the hearth
 And on the right hand of the hearth he saw
 Philip the slighted suitor of old times
 Stout rosy with his babe across his knees
 And oer her second father stoopt a girl
 A later but a loftier Annie Lee
 Fairhaird and tall and from her lifted hand
 Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring
 To tempt the babe who reard his creasy arms
 Caught at and ever missd it and they laughd
 And on the left hand of the hearth he saw
 The mother glancing often toward her babe
 But turning now and then to speak with him
 Her son who stood beside her tall and strong
 And saying that which pleased him for he smiled

 Now when the dead man come to life beheld
 His wife his wife no more and saw the babe
 Hers yet not his upon the fathers knee
 And all the warmth the peace the happiness
 And his own children tall and beautiful
 And him that other reigning in his place
 Lord of his rights and of his childrens love
 Then he tho Miriam Lane had told him all
 Because things seen are mightier than things heard
 Staggerd and shook holding the branch and feard
 To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry
 Which in one moment like the blast of doom
 Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth

 He therefore turning softly like a thief
 Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot
 And feeling all along the gardenwall
 Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found
 Crept to the gate and opend it and closed
 As lightly as a sick mans chamberdoor
 Behind him and came out upon the waste

 And there he would have knelt but that his knees
 Were feeble so that falling prone he dug
 His fingers into the wet earth and prayd

 Too hard to bear why did they take me hence
 O God Almighty blessed Saviour Thou
 That didst uphold me on my lonely isle
 Uphold me Father in my loneliness
 A little longer aid me give me strength
 Not to tell her never to let her know
 Help me no to break in upon her peace
 My children too must I not speak to these
 They know me not I should betray myself
 Never not fathers kiss for methe girl
 So like her mother and the boy my son

 There speech and thought and nature faild a little
 And he lay tranced but when he rose and paced
 Back toward his solitary home again
 All down the long and narrow street he went
 Beating it in upon his weary brain
 As tho it were the burthen of a song
 Not to tell her never to let her know

 He was not all unhappy His resolve
 Upbore him and firm faith and evermore
 Prayer from a living source within the will
 And beating up thro all the bitter world
 Like fountains of sweet water in the sea
 Kept him a living soul This millers wife
 He said to Miriam that you told me of
 Has she no fear that her first husband lives
 Ay ay poor soul said Miriam fear enow
 If you could tell her you had seen him dead
 Why that would be her comfort and he thought
 After the Lord has calld me she shall know
 I wait His time and Enoch set himself
 Scorning an alms to work whereby to live
 Almost to all things could he turn his hand
 Cooper he was and carpenter and wrought
 To make the boatmen fishingnets or helpd
 At lading and unlading the tall barks
 That brought the stinted commerce of those days
 Thus earnd a scanty living for himself
 Yet since he did but labor for himself
 Work without hope there was not life in it
 Whereby the man could live and as the year
 Rolld itself round again to meet the day
 When Enoch had returnd a languor came
 Upon him gentle sickness gradually
 Weakening the man till he could do no more
 But kept the house his chair and last his bed
 And Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully
 For sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck
 See thro the gray skirts of a lifting squall
 The boat that bears the hope of life approach
 To save the life despaird of than he saw
 Death dawning on him and the close of all

 For thro that dawning gleamd a kindlier hope
 On Enoch thinking after I am gone
 Then may she learn I loved her to the last
 He calld aloud for Miriam Lane and said
 Woman I have a secretonly swear
 Before I tell youswear upon the book
 Not to reveal it till you see me dead
 Dead clamord the good woman hear him talk
 I warrant man that we shall bring you round
 Swear add Enoch sternly on the book
 And on the book halffrighted Miriam swore
 Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her
 Did you know Enoch Arden of this town
 Know him she said I knew him far away
 Ay ay I mind him coming down the street
 Held his head high and cared for no man he
 Slowly and sadly Enoch answerd her
 His head is low and no man cares for him
 I think I have not three days more to live
 I am the man At which the woman gave
 A halfincredulous halfhysterical cry
 You Arden you naysure he was a foot
 Higher than you be Enoch said again
 My God has bowd me down to what I am
 My grief and solitude have broken me
 Nevertheless know that I am he
 Who marriedbut that name has twice been changed
 I married her who married Philip Ray
 Sit listen Then he told her of his voyage
 His wreck his lonely life his coming back
 His gazing in on Annie his resolve
 And how he kept it As the woman heard
 Fast flowd the current of her easy tears
 While in her heart she yearnd incessantly
 To rush abroad all round the little haven
 Proclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes
 But awed and promisebounded she forbore
 Saying only See your bairns before you go
 Eh let me fetch em Arden and arose
 Eager to bring them down for Enoch hung
 A moment on her words but then replied

 Woman disturb me not now at the last
 But let me hold my purpose till I die
 Sit down again mark me and understand
 While I have power to speak I charge you now
 When you shall see her tell her that I died
 Blessing her praying for her loving her
 Save for the bar between us loving her
 As when she laid her head beside my own
 And tell my daughter Annie whom I saw
 So like her mother that my latest breath
 Was spent in blessing her and praying for her
 And tell my son that I died blessing him
 And say to Philip that I blest him too
 He never meant us any thing but good
 But if my children care to see me dead
 Who hardly saw me living let them come
 I am their father but she must not come
 For my dead face would vex her afterlife
 And now there is but one of all my blood
 Who will embrace me in the worldtobe
 This hair is his she cut it off and gave it
 And I have borne it with me all these years
 And thought to bear it with me to my grave
 But now my mind is changed for I shall see him
 My babe in bliss wherefore when I am gone
 Take give her this for it may comfort her
 It will moreover be a token to her
 That I am he

 He ceased and Miriam Lane
 Made such a voluble answer promising all
 That once again he rolld his eyes upon her
 Repeating all he wishd and once again
 She promised

 Then the third night after this
 While Enoch slumberd motionless and pale
 And Miriam watchd and dozed at intervals
 There came so loud a calling of the sea
 That all the houses in the haven rang
 He woke he rose he spread his arms abroad
 Crying with a loud voice a sail a sail
 I am saved and so fell back and spoke no more

 So past the strong heroic soul away
 And when they buried him the little port
 Had seldom seen a costlier funeral





 AYLMERS FIELD
 1793





 AYLMERS FIELD
 1793
 


 Dust are our frames and gilded dust our pride
 Looks only for a moment whole and sound
 Like that longburied body of the king
 Found lying with his urns and ornaments
 Which at a touch of light an air of heaven
 Slipt into ashes and was found no more

 Here is a story which in rougher shape
 Came from a grizzled cripple whom I saw
 Sunning himself in a waste field alone
 Old and a mine of memorieswho had served
 Long since a bygone Rector of the place
 And been himself a part of what he told

 Sir Aylmer Aylmer that almighty man
 The county Godin whose capacious hall
 Hung with a hundred shields the family tree
 Sprang from the midriff of a prostrate king
 Whose blazing wyvern weathercockd the spire
 Stood from his walls and wingd his entrygates
 And swang besides on many a windy sign
 Whose eyes from under a pyramidal head
 Saw from his windows nothing save his own
 What lovelier of his own had he than her
 His only child his Edith whom he loved
 As heiress and not heir regretfully
 But he that marries her marries her name
 This fiat somewhat soothed himself and wife
 His wife a faded beauty of the Baths
 Insipid as the Queen upon a card
 Her all of thought and bearing hardly more
 Than his own shadow in a sickly sun

 A land of hops and poppymingled corn
 Little about it stirring save a brook
 A sleepy land where under the same wheel
 The same old rut would deepen year by year
 Where almost all the village had one name
 Where Aylmer followd Aylmer at the Hall
 And Averill Averill at the Rectory
 Thrice over so that Rectory and Hall
 Bound in an immemorial intimacy
 Were open to each other tho to dream
 That Love could bind them closer well had made
 The hoar hair of the Baronet bristle up
 With horror worse than had he heard his priest
 Preach an inverted scripture sons of men
 Daughters of God so sleepy was the land

 And might not Averill had he willd it so
 Somewhere beneath his own low range of roofs
 Have also set his manyshielded tree
 There was an AylmerAverill marriage once
 When the red rose was redder than itself
 And Yorks white rose as red as Lancasters
 With wounded peace which each had prickd to death
 Not proven Averill said or laughingly
 Some other race of Averillsprovn or no
 What cared he what if other or the same
 He leand not on his fathers but himself
 But Leolin his brother living oft
 With Averill and a year or two before
 Calld to the bar but ever calld away
 By one low voice to one dear neighborhood
 Would often in his walks with Edith claim
 A distant kinship to the gracious blood
 That shook the heart of Edith hearing him

 Sanguine he was a but less vivid hue
 Than of that islet in the chestnutbloom
 Flamed his cheek and eager eyes that still
 Took joyful note of all things joyful beamd
 Beneath a manelike mass of rolling gold
 Their best and brightest when they dwelt on hers
 Edith whose pensive beauty perfect else
 But subject to the season or the mood
 Shone like a mystic star between the less
 And greater glory varying to and fro
 We know not wherefore bounteously made
 And yet so finely that a troublous touch
 Thinnd or would seem to thin her in a day
 A joyous to dilate as toward the light
 And these had been together from the first
 Leolins first nurse was five years after hers
 So much the boy foreran but when his date
 Doubled her own for want of playmates he
 Since Averill was a decad and a half
 His elder and their parents underground
 Had tost his ball and flown his kite and rolld
 His hoop to pleasure Edith with her dipt
 Against the rush of the air in the prone swing
 Made blossomball or daisychain arranged
 Her garden sowd her name and kept it green
 In living letters told her fairytales
 Showd here the fairy footings on the grass
 The little dells of cowslip fairy palms
 The petty marestail forest fairy pines
 Or from the tiny pitted target blew
 What lookd a flight of fairy arrows aimd
 All at one mark all hitting makebelieves
 For Edith and himself or else he forged
 But that was later boyish histories
 Of battle bold adventure dungeon wreck
 Flights terrors sudden rescues and true love
 Crownd after trial sketches rude and faint
 But where a passion yet unborn perhaps
 Lay hidden as the music of the moon
 Sleeps in the plain eggs of the nightingale
 And thus together save for collegetimes
 Or Templeeaten terms a couple fair
 As ever painter painted poet sang
 Or Heavn in lavish bounty moulded grew
 And more and more the maiden womangrown
 He wasted hours with Averill there when first
 The tented winterfield was broken up
 Into that phalanx of the summer spears
 That soon should wear the garland there again
 When burr and bine were gatherd lastly there
 At Christmas ever welcome at the Hall
 On whose dull sameness his full tide of youth
 Broke with a phosphorescence cheering even
 My lady and the Baronet yet had laid
 No bar between them dull and selfinvolved
 Tall and erect but bending from his height
 With halfallowing smiles for all the world
 And mighty courteous in the mainhis pride
 Lay deeper than to wear it as his ring
 He like an Aylmer in his Aylmerism
 Would care no more for Leolins walking with her
 Than for his old Newfoundlands when they ran
 To loose him at the stables for he rose
 Twofooted at the limit of his chain
 Roaring to make a third and how should Love
 Whom the crosslightnings of four chancemet eyes
 Flash into fiery life from nothing follow
 Such dear familiarities of dawn
 Seldom but when he does Master of all

 So these young hearts not knowing that they loved
 Not she at least nor conscious of a bar
 Between them nor by plight or broken ring
 Bound but an immemorial intimacy
 Wanderd at will but oft accompanied
 By Averill his a brothers love that hung
 With wings of brooding shelter oer her peace
 Might have been other save for Leolins
 Who knows but so they wanderd hour by hour
 Gatherd the blossom that rebloomd and drank
 The magic cup that filld itself anew

 A whisper half reveald her to herself
 For out beyond her lodges where the brook
 Vocal with here and there a silence ran
 By sallowy rims arose the laborers homes
 A frequent haunt of Edith on low knolls
 That dimpling died into each other huts
 At random scatterd each a nest in bloom
 Her art her hand her counsel all had wrought
 About them here was one that summerblanchd
 Was parcelbearded with the travellersjoy
 In Autumn parcel ivyclad and here
 The warmblue breathings of a hidden hearth
 Broke from a bower of vine and honeysuckle
 One lookd all rosetree and another wore
 A closeset robe of jasmine sown with stars
 This had a rosy sea of gillyflowers
 About it this a milkyway on earth
 Like visions in the Northern dreamers heavens
 A lilyavenue climbing to the doors
 One almost to the martinhaunted eaves
 A summer burial deep in hollyhocks
 Each its own charm and Ediths everywhere
 And Edith ever visitant with him
 He but less loved than Edith of her poor
 For sheso lowlylovely and so loving
 Queenly responsive when the loyal hand
 Rose from the clay it workd in as she past
 Not sowing hedgerow texts and passing by
 Nor dealing goodly counsel from a height
 That makes the lowest hate it but a voice
 Of comfort and an open hand of help
 A splendid presence flattering the poor roofs
 Revered as theirs but kindlier than themselves
 To ailing wife or wailing infancy
 Or old bedridden palsywas adored
 He loved for her and for himself A grasp
 Having the warmth and muscle of the heart
 A childly way with children and a laugh
 Ringing like proved golden coinage true
 Were no false passport to that easy realm
 Where once with Leolin at her side the girl
 Nursing a child and turning to the warmth
 The tender pink fivebeaded babysoles
 Heard the good mother softly whisper Bless
 God bless em marriages are made in Heaven

 A flash of semijealousy cleard it to her
 My Ladys Indian kinsman unannounced
 With half a score of swarthy faces came
 His own tho keen and bold and soldierly
 Seard by the close ecliptic was not fair
 Fairer his talk a tongue that ruled the hour
 Tho seeming boastful so when first he dashd
 Into the chronicle of a deedful day
 Sir Aylmer half forgot his lazy smile
 Of patron Good my ladys kinsman good
 My lady with her fingers interlockd
 And rotatory thumbs on silken knees
 Calld all her vital spirits into each ear
 To listen unawares they flitted off
 Busying themselves about the flowerage
 That stood from our a stiff brocade in which
 The meteor of a splendid season she
 Once with this kinsman ah so long ago
 Stept thro the stately minuet of those days
 But Ediths eager fancy hurried with him
 Snatchd thro the perilous passes of his life
 Till Leolin ever watchful of her eye
 Hated him with a momentary hate
 Wifehunting as the rumor ran was he
 I know not for he spoke not only showerd
 His oriental gifts on everyone
 And most on Edith like a storm he came
 And shook the house and like a storm he went

 Among the gifts he left her possibly
 He flowd and ebbd uncertain to return
 When others had been tested there was one
 A dagger in rich sheath with jewels on it
 Sprinkled about in gold that branchd itself
 Fine as iceferns on January panes
 Made by a breath I know not whence at first
 Nor of what race the work but as he told
 The story storming a hillfort of thieves
 He got it for their captain after fight
 His comrades having fought their last below
 Was climbing up the valley at whom he shot
 Down from the beetling crag to which he clung
 Tumbled the tawny rascal at his feet
 This dagger with him which when now admired
 By Edith whom his pleasure was to please
 At once the costly Sahib yielded it to her

 And Leolin coming after he was gone
 Tost over all her presents petulantly
 And when she showd the wealthy scabbard saying
 Look what a lovely piece of workmanship
 Slight was his answer WellI care not for it
 Then playing with the blade he prickd his hand
 A gracious gift to give a lady this
 But would it be more gracious askd the girl
 Were I to give this gift of his to one
 That is no lady Gracious No said he
 Mebut I cared not for it O pardon me
 I seem to be ungraciousness itself
 Take it she added sweetly tho his gift
 For I am more ungracious evn than you
 I care not for it either and he said
 Why then I love it but Sir Aylmer past
 And neither loved nor liked the thing he heard

 The next day came a neighbor Blues and reds
 They talkd of blues were sure of it he thought
 Then of the latest foxwhere startedkilld
 In such a bottom Peter had the brush
 My Peter first and did Sir Aylmer know
 That great pockpitten fellow had been caught
 Then made his pleasure echo hand to hand
 And rolling as it were the substance of it
 Between his palms a moment up and down
 The birds were warm the birds were warm upon him
 We have him now and had Sir Aylmer heard
 Nay but he mustthe land was ringing of it
 This blacksmithborder marriageone they knew
 Raw from the nurserywho could trust a child
 That cursed France with her egalities
 And did Sir Aylmer deferentially
 With nearing chair and lowerd accent think
 For people talkdthat it was wholly wise
 To let that handsome fellow Averill walk
 So freely with his daughter people talkd
 The boy might get a notion into him
 The girl might be entangled ere she knew
 Sir Aylmer Aylmer slowly stiffening spoke
 The girl and boy Sir know their differences
 Good said his friend but watch and he enough
 More than enough Sir I can guard my own
 They parted and Sir Aylmer Aylmer watchd

 Pale for on her the thunders of the house
 Had fallen first was Edith that same night
 Pale as the Jepthas daughter a rough piece
 Of early rigid color under which
 Withdrawing by the counter door to that
 Which Leolin opend she cast back upon him
 A piteous glance and vanishd He as one
 Caught in a burst of unexpected storm
 And pelted with outrageous epithets
 Turning beheld the Powers of the House
 On either side the hearth indignant her
 Cooling her false cheek with a featherfan
 Him glaring by his own stale devil spurrd
 And like a beast hardridden breathing hard
 Ungenerous dishonorable base
 Presumptuous trusted as he was with her
 The sole succeeder to their wealth their lands
 The last remaining pillar of their house
 The one transmitter of their ancient name
 Their child Our child Our heiress Ours for
 still
 Like echoes from beyond a hollow came
 Her sicklier iteration Last he said
 Boy mark me for your fortunes are to make
 I swear you shall not make them out of mine
 Now inasmuch as you have practised on her
 Perplext her made her half forget herself
 Swerve from her duty to herself and us
 Things in an Aylmer deemd impossible
 Far as we track ourselvesI say that this
 Else I withdraw favor and countenance
 From you and yours for evershall you do
 Sir when you see herbut you shall not see her
 No you shall write and not to her but me
 And you shall say that having spoken with me
 And after lookd into yourself you find
 That you meant nothingas indeed you know
 That you meant nothing Such as match as this
 Impossible prodigious These were words
 As meted by his measure of himself
 Arguing boundless forbearance after which
 And Leolins horrorstricken answer I
 So foul a traitor to myself and her
 Never oh never for about as long
 As the windhover hangs in the balance paused
 Sir Aylmer reddening from the storm within
 Then broke all bonds of courtesy and crying
 Boy should I find you by my doors again
 My men shall lash you from the like a dog
 Hence with a sudden execration drove
 The footstool from before him and arose
 So stammering scoundrel out of teeth that ground
 As in a dreadful dream while Leolin still
 Retreated halfaghast the fierce old man
 Followd and under his own lintel stood
 Storming with lifted hands a hoary face
 Meet for the reverence of the hearth but now
 Beneath a pale and unimpassiond moon
 Vext with unworthy madness and deformd

 Slowly and conscious of the rageful eye
 That watchd him till he heard the ponderous door
 Close crashing with long echoes thro the land
 Went Leolin then his passions all in flood
 And masters of his motion furiously
 Down thro the bright lawns to his brothers ran
 And foamd away his heart at Averills ear
 Whom Averill solaced as he might amazed
 The man was his had been his fathers friend
 He must have seen himself had seen it long
 He must have known himself had known besides
 He never yet had set his daughter forth
 Here in the womanmarkets of the west
 Where our Caucasians let themselves be sold
 Some one he thought had slanderd Leolin to him
 Brother for I have loved you more as a son
 Than brother let me tell you I myself
 What is their pretty saying jilted is it
 Jilted I was I say it for your peace
 Paind and as bearing in myself the shame
 The woman should have borne humiliated
 I lived for years a stunted sunless life
 Till after our good parents past away
 Watching your growth I seemd again to grow
 Leolin I almost sin in envying you
 The very whitest lamb in all my fold
 Loves you I know her the worst thought she has
 Is whiter even than her pretty hand
 She must prove true for brother where two fight
 The strongest wins and truth and love are strength
 And you are happy let her parents be

 But Leolin cried out the more upon them
 Insolent brainless heartless heiress wealth
 Their wealth their heiress wealth enough was theirs
 For twenty matches Were he lord of this
 Why twenty boys and girls should marry on it
 And forty blest ones bless him and himself
 Be wealthy still ay wealthier He believed
 This filthy marriagehindering Mammon made
 The harlot of the cities nature crost
 Was mother of the foul adulteries
 That saturate soul with body Name too name
 Their ancient name they MIGHT be proud its worth
 Was being Ediths Ah how pale she had lookd
 Darling tonight they must have rated her
 Beyond all tolerance These old pheasantlords
 These partridgebreeders of a thousand years
 Who had mildewd in their thousands doing nothing
 Since Egbertwhy the greater their disgrace
 Fall back upon a name rest rot in that
 Not KEEP it noble make it nobler fools
 With such a vantageground for nobleness
 He had known a man a quintessence of man
 The life of allwho madly lovedand he
 Thwarted by one of these old fatherfools
 Had rioted his life out and made an end
 He would not do it her sweet face and faith
 Held him from that but he had powers he knew it
 Back would he to his studies make a name
 Name fortune too the world should ring of him
 To shame these mouldy Aylmers in their graves
 Chancellor or what is greatest would he be
 O brother I am grieved to learn your grief
 Give me my fling and let me say my say

 At which like one that sees his own excess
 And easily forgives it as his own
 He laughd and then was mute but presently
 Wept like a storm and honest Averill seeing
 How low his brothers mood had fallen fetchd
 His richest beeswing from a binn reserved
 For banquets praised the waning red and told
 The vintagewhen THIS Aylmer came of age
 Then drank and past it till at length the two
 Tho Leolin flamed and fell again agreed
 That much allowance must be made for men
 After an angry dream this kindlier glow
 Faded with morning but his purpose held

 Yet once by night again the lovers met
 A perilous meeting under the tall pines
 That darkend all the northward of her Hall
 Him to her meek and modest bosom prest
 In agony she promised that no force
 Persuasion no nor death could alter her
 He passionately hopefuller would go
 Labor for his own Edith and return
 In such a sunlight of prosperity
 He should not be rejected Write to me
 They loved me and because I love their child
 They hate me there is war between us dear
 Which breaks all bonds but ours we must remain
 Sacred to one another So they talkd
 Poor children for their comfort the wind blew
 The rain of heaven and their own bitter tears
 Tears and the careless rain of heaven mixt
 Upon their faces as they kissd each other
 In darkness and above them roard the pine

 So Leolin went and as we task ourselves
 To learn a language known but smatteringly
 In phrases here and there at random toild
 Mastering the lawless science of our law
 That codeless myriad of precedent
 That wilderness of single instances
 Thro which a few by wit or fortune led
 May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame
 The jests that flashd about the pleaders room
 Lightning of the hour the pun the scurrilous tale
 Old scandals buried now seven decads deep
 In other scandals that have lived and died
 And left the living scandal that shall die
 Were dead to him already bent as he was
 To make disproof of scorn and strong in hopes
 And prodigal of all brainlabor he
 Charier of sleep and wine and exercise
 Except when for a breathingwhile at eve
 Some niggard fraction of an hour he ran
 Beside the riverbank and then indeed
 Harder the times were and the hands of power
 Were bloodier and the according hearts of men
 Seemd harder too but the soft riverbreeze
 Which fannd the gardens of that rival rose
 Yet fragrant in a heart remembering
 His former talks with Edith on him breathed
 Far purelier in his rushings to and fro
 After his books to flush his blood with air
 Then to his books again My ladys cousin
 Halfsickening of his pensiond afternoon
 Drove in upon the student once or twice
 Ran a Malayan muck against the times
 Had golden hopes for France and all mankind
 Answerd all queries touching those at home
 With a heaved shoulder and a saucy smile
 And fain had haled him out into the world
 And aird him there his nearer friend would say
 Screw not the chord too sharply lest it snap
 Then left alone he pluckd her dagger forth
 From where his worldless heart had kept it warm
 Kissing his vows upon it like a knight
 And wrinkled benchers often talkd of him
 Approvingly and prophesied his rise
 For heart I think helpd head her letters too
 Tho far between and coming fitfully
 Like broken music written as she found
 Or made occasion being strictly watchd
 Charmd him thro every labyrinth till he saw
 An end a hope a light breaking upon him

 But they that cast her spirit into flesh
 Her worldywise begetters plagued themselves
 To sell her those good parents for her good
 Whatever eldestborn of rank or wealth
 Might lie within their compass him they lured
 Into their net made pleasant by the baits
 Of gold and beauty wooing him to woo
 So month by month the noise about their doors
 And distant blaze of those dull banquets made
 The nightly wirer of their innocent hare
 Falter before he took it All in vain
 Sullen defiant pitying wroth returnd
 Leolins rejected rivals from their suit
 So often that the folly taking wings
 Slipt oer those lazy limits down the wind
 With rumor and became in other fields
 A mockery to the yeomen over ale
 And laughter to their lords but those at home
 As hunters round a hunted creature draw
 The cordon close and closer toward the death
 Narrowd her goings out and comings in
 Forbad her first the house of Averill
 Then closed her access to the wealthiest farms
 Last from her own homecircle of the poor
 They barrd her yet she bore it yet her cheek
 Kept color wondrous but O mystery
 What amulet drew her down to that old oak
 So old that twenty years before a part
 Falling had let appear the brand of John
 Once grovelike each huge arm a tree but now
 The broken base of a black tower a cave
 Of touchwood with a single flourishing spray
 There the manorial lord too curiously
 Raking in that millenial touchwooddust
 Found for himself a bitter treasuretrove
 Burst his own wyvern on the seal and read
 Writhing a letter from his child for which
 Came at the moment Leolins emissary
 A crippled lad and coming turnd to fly
 But scared with threats of jail and halter gave
 To him that flusterd his poor parish wits
 The letter which he brought and swore besides
 To play their gobetween as heretofore
 Nor let them know themselves betrayd and then
 Soulstricken at their kindness to him went
 Hating his own lean heart and miserable

 Thenceforward oft from out a despot dream
 Panting he woke and oft as early as dawn
 Aroused the black republic on his elms
 Sweeping the frothfly from the fescue brushd
 Thro the dim meadow toward his treasuretrove
 Seized it took home and to my lady who made
 A downward crescent of her minion mouth
 Listless in all despondence read and tore
 As if the living passion symbold there
 Were living nerves to feel the rent and burnt
 Now chafing at his own great self defied
 Now striking on huge stumblingblocks of scorn
 In babyisms and dear diminutives
 Scatterd all over the vocabulary
 Of such a love as like a chidden babe
 After much wailing hushd itself at last
 Hopeless of answer then tho Averill wrote
 And bad him with good heart sustain himself
 All would be wellthe lover heeded not
 But passionately restless came and went
 And rustling once at night about the place
 There by a keeper shot at slightly hurt
 Raging returnd nor was it well for her
 Kept to the garden now and grove of pines
 Watchd even there and one was set to watch
 The watcher and Sir Aylmer watchd them all
 Yet bitterer from his readings once indeed
 Warmd with his wines or taking pride in her
 She lookd so sweet he kissd her tenderly
 Not knowing what possessd him that one kiss
 Was Leolins one strong rival upon earth
 Seconded for my lady followd suit
 Seemd hopes returning rose and then ensued
 A Martins summer of his faded love
 Or ordeal by kindness after this
 He seldom crost his child without a sneer
 The mother flowd in shallower acrimonies
 Never one kindly smile one kindly word
 So that the gentle creature shut from all
 Her charitable use and face to face
 With twenty months of silence slowly lost
 Nor greatly cared to lose her hold on life
 Last some low fever ranging round to spy
 The weakness of a people or a house
 Like flies that haunt a wound or deer or men
 Or almost all that is hurting the hurt
 Save Christ as we believe himfound the girl
 And flung her down upon a couch of fire
 Where careless of the household faces near
 And crying upon the name of Leolin
 She and with her the race of Aylmer past

 Star to star vibrates light may soul to soul
 Strike thro a finer element of her own
 Sofrom afartouch as at once or why
 That night that moment when she named his name
 Did the keen shriek yes love yes Edith yes
 Shrill till the comrade of his chambers woke
 And came upon him halfarisen from sleep
 With a weird bright eye sweating and trembling
 His hair as it were crackling into flames
 His body half flung forward in pursuit
 And his long arms stretchd as to grasp a flyer
 Nor knew he wherefore he had made the cry
 And being much befoold and idioted
 By the rough amity of the other sank
 As into sleep again The second day
 My ladys Indian kinsman rushing in
 A breaker of the bitter news from home
 Found a dead man a letter edged with death
 Beside him and the dagger which himself
 Gave Edith reddnd with no bandits blood
 From Edith was engraven on the blade

 Then Averill went and gazed upon his death
 And when he came again his flock believed
 Beholding how the years which are not Times
 Had blasted himthat many thousand days
 Were clipt by horror from his term of life
 Yet the sad mother for the second death
 Scarce touchd her thro that nearness of the first
 And being used to find her pastor texts
 Sent to the harrowd brother praying him
 To speak before the people of her child
 And fixt the Sabbath Darkly that day rose
 Autumns mock sunshine of the faded woods
 Was all the life of it for hard on these
 A breathless burthen of lowfolded heavens
 Stifled and chilld at once but every roof
 Sent out a listener many too had known
 Edith among the hamlets round and since
 The parents harshness and the hapless loves
 And double death were widely murmurd left
 Their own gray tower or plainfaced tabernacle
 To hear him all in mourning these and those
 With blots of it about them ribbon glove
 Or kerchief while the churchone night except
 For greenish glimmerings thro the lancetsmade
 Still paler the pale head of him who towerd
 Above them with his hopes in either grave

 Long oer his bent brows lingerd Averill
 His face magnetic to the hand from which
 Livid he pluckd it forth and labord thro
 His brief prayerprelude gave the verse Behold
 Your house is left unto you desolate
 But lapsed into so long a pause again
 As half amazed half frighted all his flock
 Then from his height and loneliness of grief
 Bore down in flood and dashd his angry heart
 Against the desolations of the world

 Never since our bad earth became one sea
 Which rolling oer the palaces of the proud
 And all but those who knew the living God
 Eight that were left to make a purer world
 When since had flood fire earthquake thunder wrought
 Such waste and havoc as the idolatries
 Which from the low light of mortality
 Shot up their shadows to the Heaven of Heavens
 And worshipt their own darkness as the Highest
 Gash thyself priest and honor thy brute Baal
 And to thy worst self sacrifice thyself
 For with thy worst self hast thou clothed thy God
 Then came a Lord in no wise like to Baal
 The babe shall lead the lion Surely now
 The wilderness shall blossom as the rose
 Crown thyself worm and worship thine own lusts
 No coarse and blockish God of acreage
 Stands at thy gate for thee to grovel to
 Thy God is far diffused in noble groves
 And princely halls and farms and flowing lawns
 And heaps of living gold that daily grow
 And titlescrolls and gorgeous heraldries
 In such a shape dost thou behold thy God
 Thou wilt not gash thy flesh for HIM for thine
 Fares richly in fine linen not a hair
 Ruffled upon the scarfskin even while
 The deathless ruler of thy dying house
 Is wounded to the death that cannot die
 And tho thou numberest with the followers
 Of One who cried leave all and follow me
 Thee therefore with His light about thy feet
 Thee with His message ringing in thine ears
 Thee shall thy brother man the Lord from Heaven
 Born of a village girl carpenters son
 Wonderful Prince of peace the Mighty God
 Count the more base idolater of the two
 Crueller as not passing thro the fire
 Bodies but soulsthy childrensthro the smoke
 The blight of low desiresdarkening thine own
 To thine own likeness or if one of these
 Thy better born unhappily from thee
 Should as by miracle grow straight and fair
 Friends I was bid to speak of such a one
 By those who most have cause to sorrow for her
 Fairer than Rachel by the palmy well
 Fairer than Ruth among the fields of corn
 Fair as the Angel that said hail she seemd
 Who entering filld the house with sudden light
 For so mine own was brightend where indeed
 The roof so lowly but that beam of Heaven
 Dawnd sometime thro the doorway whose the babe
 Too ragged to be fondled on her lap
 Warmd at her bosom The poor child of shame
 The common care whom no one cared for leapt
 To greet her wasting his forgotten heart
 As with the mother he had never known
 In gambols for her fresh and innocent eyes
 Had such a star of morning in their blue
 That all neglected places of the field
 Broke into natures music when they saw her
 Low was her voice but won mysterious way
 Thro the seald ear to which a louder one
 Was all but silencefree of alms her hand
 The hand that robed your cottagewalls with flowers
 Has often toild to clothe your little ones
 How often placed upon the sick mans brow
 Coold it or laid his feverous pillow smooth
 Had you one sorrow and she shared it not
 One burthen and she would not lighten it
 One spiritual doubt she did not soothe
 Or when some heat of difference sparkled out
 How sweetly would she glide between your wraths
 And steal you from each other for she walkd
 Wearing the light yoke of that Lord of love
 Who stilld the rolling wave of Galilee
 And oneof him I was not bid to speak
 Was always with her whom you also knew
 Him too you loved for he was worthy love
 And these had been together from the first
 They might have been together till the last
 Friends this frail bark of ours when sorely tried
 May wreck itself without the pilots guilt
 Without the captains knowledge hope with me
 Whose shame is that if he went hence with shame
 Nor mine the fault if losing both of these
 I cry to vacant chairs and widowd walls
 My house is left unto me desolate

 While thus he spoke his hearers wept but some
 Sons of the glebe with other frowns than those
 That knit themselves for summer shadow scowld
 At their great lord He when it seemd he saw
 No pale sheetlightnings from afar but forkd
 Of the near storm and aiming at his head
 Sat angercharmd from sorrow soldierlike
 Erect but when the preachers cadence flowd
 Softening thro all the gentle attributes
 Of his lost child the wife who watchd his face
 Paled at a sudden twitch of his iron mouth
 And O pray God that he hold up she thought
 Or surely I shall shame myself and him

 Nor yours the blamefor who beside your hearths
 Can take her placeif echoing me you cry
 Our house is left unto us desolate
 But thou O thou that killest hadst thou known
 O thou that stonest hadst thou understood
 The things belonging to thy peace and ours
 Is there no prophet but the voice that calls
 Doom upon kings or in the waste Repent
 Is not our own child on the narrow way
 Who down to those that saunter in the broad
 Cries come up hither as a prophet to us
 Is there no stoning save with flint and rock
 Yes as the dead we weep for testify
 No desolation but by sword and fire
 Yes as your moanings witness and myself
 Am lonelier darker earthlier for my loss
 Give me your prayers for he is past your prayers
 Not past the living fount of pity in Heaven
 But I that thought myself longsuffering meek
 Exceeding poor in spirithow the words
 Have twisted back upon themselves and mean
 Vileness we are grown so proudI wishd my voice
 A rushing tempest of the wrath of God
 To blow these sacrifices thro the world
 Sent like the twelvedivided concubine
 To inflame the tribes but thereout yonderearth
 Lightens from her own central HellO there
 The red fruit of an old idolatry
 The heads of chiefs and princes fall so fast
 They cling together in the ghastly sack
 The land all shamblesnaked marriages
 Flash from the bridge and evermurderd France
 By shores that darken with the gathering wolf
 Runs in a river of blood to the sick sea
 Is this a time to madden madness then
 Was this a time for these to flaunt their pride
 May Pharaohs darkness folds as dense as those
 Which hid the Holiest from the peoples eyes
 Ere the great death shroud this great sin from all
 Doubtless our narrow world must canvass it
 O rather pray for those and pity them
 Who thro their own desire accomplishd bring
 Their own gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
 Who broke the bond which they desired to break
 Which else had linkd their race with times to come
 Who wove coarse webs to snare her purity
 Grossly contriving their dear daughters good
 Poor souls and knew not what they did but sat
 Ignorant devising their own daughters death
 May not that earthly chastisement suffice
 Have not our love and reverence left them bare
 Will not another take their heritage
 Will there be childrens laughter in their hall
 For ever and for ever or one stone
 Left on another or is it a light thing
 That I their guest their host their ancient friend
 I made by these the last of all my race
 Must cry to these the last of theirs as cried
 Christ ere His agony to those that swore
 Not by the temple but the gold and made
 Their own traditions God and slew the Lord
 And left their memories a worlds curseBehold
 Your house is left unto you desolate

 Ended he had not but she brookd no more
 Long since her heart had beat remorselessly
 Her cramptup sorrow paind her and a sense
 Of meanness in her unresisting life
 Then their eyes vext her for on entering
 He had cast the curtains of their seat aside
 Black velvet of the costliestshe herself
 Had seen to that fain had she closed them now
 Yet dared not stir to do it only neard
 Her husband inch by inch but when she laid
 Wifelike her hand in one of his he veild
 His face with the other and at once as falls
 A creeper when the prop is broken fell
 The woman shrieking at his feet and swoond
 Then her own people bore along the nave
 Her pendent hands and narrow meagre face
 Seamd with the shallow cares of fifty years
 And here the Lord of all the landscape round
 Evn to its last horizon and of all
 Who peerd at him so keenly followd out
 Tall and erect but in the middle aisle
 Reeld as a footsore ox in crowded ways
 Stumbling across the market to his death
 Unpitied for he groped as blind and seemd
 Always about to fall grasping the pews
 And oaken finials till he touchd the door
 Yet to the lychgate where his chariot stood
 Strode from the porch tall and erect again

 But nevermore did either pass the gate
 Save under pall with bearers In one month
 Thro weary and yet wearier hours
 The childless mother went to seek her child
 And when he felt the silence of his house
 About him and the change and not the change
 And those fixt eyes of painted ancestors
 Staring for ever from their gilded walls
 On him their last descendant his own head
 Began to droop to fall the man became
 Imbecile his one word was desolate
 Dead for two years before his death was he
 But when the second Christmas came escaped
 His keepers and the silence which he felt
 To find a deeper in the narrow gloom
 By wife and child nor wanted at his end
 The dark retinue reverencing death
 At golden thresholds nor from tender hearts
 And those who sorrowd oer a vanishd race
 Pity the violet on the tyrants grave
 Then the great Hall was wholly broken down
 And the broad woodland parcelld into farms
 And where the two contrived their daughters good
 Lies the hawks cast the mole has made his run
 The hedgehog underneath the plaintain bores
 The rabbit fondles his own harmless face
 The slowworm creeps and the thin weasel there
 Follows the mouse and all is open field





 SEA DREAMS





 SEA DREAMS
 


 A city clerk but gently born and bred
 His wife an unknown artists orphan child
 One babe was theirs a Margaret three years old
 They thinking that her clear germander eye
 Droopt in the giantfactoried citygloom
 Came with a months leave given them to the sea
 For which his gains were dockd however small
 Small were his gains and hard his work besides
 Their slender household fortunes for the man
 Had riskd his little like the little thrift
 Trembled in perilous places oer a deep
 And oft when sitting all alone his face
 Would darken as he cursed his credulousness
 And that one unctuous mount which lured him rogue
 To buy strange shares in some Peruvian mine
 Now seawardbound for health they gaind a coast
 All sand and cliff and deepinrunning cave
 At close of day slept woke and went the next
 The Sabbath pious variers from the church
 To chapel where a heated pulpiteer
 Not preaching simple Christ to simple men
 Announced the coming doom and fulminated
 Against the scarlet woman and her creed
 For sideways up he swung his arms and shriekd
 Thus thus with violence evn as if he held
 The Apocalyptic millstone and himself
 Were that great Angel Thus with violence
 Shall Babylon be cast into the sea
 Then comes the close The gentlehearted wife
 Sat shuddering at the ruin of a world
 He at his own but when the wordy storm
 Had ended forth they came and paced the shore
 Ran in and out the long seaframing caves
 Drank the large air and saw but scarce believed
 The sootflake of so many a summer still
 Clung to their fancies that they saw the sea
 So now on sand they walkd and now on cliff
 Lingering about the thymy promontories
 Till all the sails were darkend in the west
 And rosed in the east then homeward and to bed
 Where she who kept a tender Christian hope
 Haunting a holy text and still to that
 Returning as the bird returns at night
 Let not the sun go down upon your wrath
 Said Love forgive him but he did not speak
 And silenced by that silence lay the wife
 Remembering her dear Lord who died for all
 And musing on the little lives of men
 And how they mar this little by their feuds

 But while the two were sleeping a full tide
 Rose with groundswell which on the foremost rocks
 Touching upjetted in spirts of wild seasmoke
 And scaled in sheets of wasteful foam and fell
 In vast seacataractsever and anon
 Dead claps of thunder from within the cliffs
 Heard thro the living roar At this the babe
 Their Margaret cradled near them waild and woke
 The mother and the father suddenly cried
 A wreck a wreck then turnd and groaning said

 Forgive How many will say forgive and find
 A sort of absolution in the sound
 To hate a little longer No the sin
 That neither God nor man can well forgive
 Hypocrisy I saw it in him at once
 Is it so true that second thoughts are best
 Not first and third which are a riper first
 Too ripe too late they come too late for use
 Ah love there surely lives in man and beast
 Something divine to warn them of their foes
 And such a sense when first I fronted him
 Said trust him not but after when I came
 To know him more I lost it knew him less
 Fought with what seemd my own uncharity
 Sat at his table drank his costly wines
 Made more and more allowance for his talk
 Went further fool and trusted him with all
 All my poor scrapings from a dozen years
 Of dust and deskwork there is no such mine
 None but a gulf of ruin swallowing gold
 Not making Ruind ruind the sea roars
 Ruin a fearful night

 Not fearful fair
 Said the good wife if every star in heaven
 Can make it fair you do but bear the tide
 Had you ill dreams

 O yes he said I dreamd
 Of such a tide swelling toward the land
 And I from out the boundless outer deep
 Swept with it to the shore and enterd one
 Of those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs
 I thought the motion of the boundless deep
 Bore through the cave and I was heaved upon it
 In darkness then I saw one lovely star
 Larger and larger What a world I thought
 To live in but in moving I found
 Only the landward exit of the cave
 Bright with the sun upon the stream beyond
 And near the light a giant woman sat
 All over earthy like a piece of earth
 A pickaxe in her hand then out I slipt
 Into a land all of sun and blossom trees
 As high as heaven and every bird that sings
 And here the nightlight flickering in my eyes
 Awoke me

 That was then your dream she said
 Not sad but sweet

 So sweet I lay said he
 And mused upon it drifting up the stream
 In fancy till I slept again and pieced
 The broken vision for I dreamd that still
 The motion of the great deep bore me on
 And that the woman walkd upon the brink
 I wonderd at her strength and askd her of it
 It came she said by working in the mines
 O then to ask her of my shares I thought
 And askd but not a word she shook her head
 And then the motion of the current ceased
 And there was rolling thunder and we reachd
 A mountain like a wall of burs and thorns
 But she with her strong feet up the steep hill
 Trod out a path I followd and at top
 She pointed seaward there a fleet of glass
 That seemd a fleet of jewels under me
 Sailing along before a gloomy cloud
 That not one moment ceased to thunder past
 In sunshine right across its track there lay
 Down in the water a long reef of gold
 Or what seemd gold and I was glad at first
 To think that in our oftenransackd world
 Still so much gold was left and then I feard
 Lest the gay navy there should splinter on it
 And fearing waved my arm to warn them off
 An idle signal for the brittle fleet
 I thought I could have died to save it neard
 Touchd clinkd and clashd and vanishd and I woke
 I heard the clash so clearly Now I see
 My dream was Life the woman honest Work
 And my poor venture but a fleet of glass
 Wreckd on a reef of visionary gold

 Nay said the kindly wife to comfort him
 You raised your arm you tumbled down and broke
 The glass with little Margarets medicine it it
 And breaking that you made and broke your dream
 A trifle makes a dream a trifle breaks

 No trifle groand the husband yesterday
 I met him suddenly in the street and askd
 That which I askd the woman in my dream
 Like her he shook his head Show me the books
 He dodged me with a long and loose account
 The books the books but he he could not wait
 Bound on a matter he of life and death
 When the great Books see Daniel seven and ten
 Were opend I should find he meant me well
 And then began to bloat himself and ooze
 All over with the fat affectionate smile
 That makes the widow lean My dearest friend
 Have faith have faith We live by faith said he
 And all things work together for the good
 Of thoseit makes me sick to quote himlast
 Gript my hand hard and with Godblessyou went
 I stood like one that had received a blow
 I found a hard friend in his loose accounts
 A loose one in the hard grip of his hand
 A curse in his Godblessyou then my eyes
 Pursued him down the street and far away
 Among the honest shoulders of the crowd
 Read rascal in the motions of his back
 And scoundrel in the supplesliding knee

 Was he so bound poor soul said the good wife
 So are we all but do not call him love
 Before you prove him rogue and proved forgive
 His gain is loss for he that wrongs his friend
 Wrongs himself more and ever bears about
 A silent court of justice in his breast
 Himself the judge and jury and himself
 The prisoner at the bar ever condemnd
 And that drags down his life then comes what comes
 Hereafter and he meant he said he meant
 Perhaps he meant or partly meant you well

 With all his conscience and one eye askew
 Love let me quote these lines that you may learn
 A man is likewise counsel for himself
 Too often in that silent court of yours
 With all his conscience and one eye askew
 So false he partly took himself for true
 Whose pious talk when most his heart was dry
 Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye
 Who never naming God except for gain
 So never took that useful name in vain
 Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool
 And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool
 Nor deeds of gift but gifts of grace he forged
 And snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged
 And oft at Bible meetings oer the rest
 Arising did his holy oily best
 Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven
 To spread the Word by which himself had thriven
 How like you this old satire

 Nay she said
 I loathe it he had never kindly heart
 Nor ever cared to better his own kind
 Who first wrote satire with no pity in it
 But will you hear MY dream for I had one
 That altogether went to music Still
 It awed me

 Then she told it having dreamd
 Of that same coast

 But round the North a light
 A belt it seemd of luminous vapor lay
 And ever in it a low musical note
 Swelld up and died and as it swelld a ridge
 Of breaker issued from the belt and still
 Grew with the growing note and when the note
 Had reachd a thunderous fullness on those cliffs
 Broke mixt with awful light the same as that
 Living within the belt whereby she saw
 That all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more
 But huge cathedral fronts of every age
 Grave florid stern as far as eye could see
 One after one and then the great ridge drew
 Lessening to the lessening music back
 And past into the belt and swelld again
 Slowly to music ever when it broke
 The statues king or saint or founder fell
 Then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left
 Came men and women in dark clusters round
 Some crying Set them up they shall not fall
 And others Let them lie for they have falln
 And still they strove and wrangled and she grieved
 In her strange dream she knew not why to find
 Their wildest wailings never out of tune
 With that sweet note and ever as their shrieks
 Ran highest up the gamut that great wave
 Returning while none markd it on the crowd
 Broke mixt with awful light and showd their eyes
 Glaring and passionate looks and swept away
 The men of flesh and blood and men of stone
 To the waste deeps together

 Then I fixt
 My wistful eyes on two fair images
 Both crownd with stars and high among the stars
 The Virgin Mother standing with her child
 High up on one of those dark minsterfronts
 Till she began to totter and the child
 Clung to the mother and sent out a cry
 Which mixt with little Margarets and I woke
 And my dream awed mewellbut what are dreams
 Yours came but from the breaking of a glass
 And mine but from the crying of a child

 Child No said he but this tides roar and his
 Our Boanerges with his threats of doom
 And loudlungd Antibabylonianisms
 Altho I grant but little music there
 Went both to make your dream but if there were
 A music harmonizing our wild cries
 Spheremusic such as that you dreamd about
 Why that would make our passions far too like
 The discords dear to the musician No
 One shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven
 True Devils with no ear they howl in tune
 With nothing but the Devil

 True indeed
 One of our town but later by an hour
 Here than ourselves spoke with me on the shore
 While you were running down the sands and made
 The dimpled flounce of the seafurbelow flap
 Good man to please the child She brought strange news
 Why were you silent when I spoke tonight
 I had set my heart on your forgiving him
 Before you knew We MUST forgive the dead

 Dead who is dead

 The man your eye pursued
 A little after you had parted with him
 He suddenly dropt dead of heartdisease

 Dead he of heartdisease what heart had he
 To die of dead

 Ah dearest if there be
 A devil in man there is an angel too
 And if he did that wrong you charge him with
 His angel broke his heart But your rough voice
 You spoke so loud has roused the child again
 Sleep little birdie sleep will she not sleep
 Without her little birdie well then sleep
 And I will sing you birdie

 Saying this
 The woman half turnd round from him she loved
 Left him one hand and reaching thro the night
 Her other found for it was close beside
 And half embraced the basket cradlehead
 With one soft arm which like the pliant bough
 That moving moves the nest and nestling swayd
 The cradle while she sang this baby song

 What does the little birdie say
 In her nest at peep of day
 Let me fly says little birdie
 Mother let me fly away
 Birdie rest a little longer
 Till the little wings are stronger
 So she rests a little longer
 Then she flies away

 What does little baby say
 In her bed at peep of day
 Baby says like little birdie
 Let me rise and fly away
 Baby sleep a little longer
 Till the little limbs are stronger
 If she sleeps a little longer
 Baby too shall fly away

 She sleeps let us too let all evil sleep
 He also sleepsanother sleep than ours
 He can do no more wrong forgive him dear
 And I shall sleep the sounder

 Then the man
 His deeds yet live the worst is yet to come
 Yet let your sleep for this one night be sound
 I do forgive him

 Thanks my love she said
 Your own will be the sweeter and they slept





 THE GRANDMOTHER





 THE GRANDMOTHER
 


 I
 And Willy my eldestborn is gone you say little
 Anne
 Ruddy and white and strong on his legs he looks
 like a man
 And Willys wife has written she never was
 overwise
 Never the wife for Willy he would nt take my advice

 II
 For Annie you see her father was not the man to
 save
 Had nt a head to manage and drank himself into his
 grave
 Pretty enough very pretty but I was against it for
 one
 Ehbut he would nt hear meand Willy you say
 is gone

 III
 Willy my beauty my eldestborn the flower of the
 flock
 Never a man could fling him for Willy stood like a
 rock
 Heres a leg for a babe of a week says doctor and
 he would be bound
 There was not his like that year in twenty parishes
 round

 IV
 Strong of his hands and strong on his legs but still of
 his tongue
 I ought to have gone before him I wonder he went
 so young
 I cannot cry for him Annie I have not long to
 stay
 Perhaps I shall see him the sooner for he lived far
 away

 V
 Why do you look at me Annie you think I am hard
 and cold
 But all my children have gone before me I am so
 old
 I cannot weep for Willy nor can I weep for the
 rest
 Only at your age Annie I could have wept with the
 best

 VI
 For I remember a quarrel I had with your father my
 dear
 All for a slanderous story that cost me many a
 tear
 I mean your grandfather Annie it cost me a world
 of woe
 Seventy years ago my darling seventy years
 ago

 VII
 For Jenny my cousin had come to the place and I
 knew right well
 That Jenny had tript in her time I knew but I
 would not tell
 And she to be coming and slandering me the base
 little liar
 But the tongue is a fire as you know my dear the
 tongue is a fire

 VIII
 And the parson made it his text that week and he
 said likewise
 That a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of
 lies
 That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought
 with outright
 But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to
 fight

 IX
 And Willy had not been down to the farm for a week
 and a day
 And all things lookd halfdead tho it was the middle
 of May
 Jenny to slander me who knew what Jenny had
 been
 But soiling another Annie will never make oneself
 clean

 X
 And I cried myself wellnigh blind and all of an
 evening late
 I climbd to the top of the garth and stood by the
 road at the gate
 The moon like a rick on fire was rising over the
 dale
 And whit whit whit in the bush beside me chirrupt
 the nightingale

 XI
 All of a sudden he stopt there past by the gate of
 the farm
 Willyhe did nt see meand Jenny hung on his
 arm
 Out into the road I started and spoke I scarce knew
 how
 Ah theres no fool like the old oneit makes me
 angry now

 XII
 Willy stood up like a man and lookd the thing that
 he meant
 Jenny the viper made me a mocking courtesy and
 went
 And I said Let us part in a hundred years itll all
 be the same
 You cannot love me at all if you love not my good
 name

 XIII
 And he turnd and I saw his eyes all wet in the sweet
 moonshine
 Sweetheart I love you so well that your good name
 is mine
 And what do I care for Jane let her speak of you well
 of ill
 But marry me out of hand we two shall be happy
 still

 XIV
 Marry you Willy said I but I needs must speak
 my mind
 And I fear youll listen to tales be jealous and hard
 and unkind
 But he turnd and claspt me in his arms and answerd
 No love no
 Seventy years ago my darling seventy years
 ago

 XV
 So Willy and I were wedded I wore a lilac
 gown
 And the ringers rang with a will and he gave the
 ringers a crown
 But the first that ever I bare was dead before he was
 born
 Shadow and shine is life little Annie flower and
 thorn

 XVI
 That was the first time too that ever I thought of
 death
 There lay the sweet little body that never had drawn
 a breath
 I had not wept little Anne not since I had been a
 wife
 But I wept like a child that day for the babe had
 fought for his life

 XVII
 His dear little face was troubled as if with anger or
 pain
 I lookd at the still little bodyhis trouble had all
 been in vain
 For Willy I cannot weep I shall see him another
 morn
 But I wept like a child for the child that was dead
 before he was born

 XVIII
 But he cheerd me my good man for he seldom said me
 nay
 Kind like a man was he like a man too would have
 his way
 Never jealousnot he we had many a happy
 year
 And he died and I could not weepmy own time
 seemd so near

 XIX
 But I wishd it had been Gods will that I too then
 could have died
 I began to be tired a little and fain had slept at his
 side
 And that was ten years back or more if I dont
 forget
 But as to the children Annie theyre all about me
 yet

 XX
 Pattering over the boards my Annie who left me at
 two
 Patter she goes my own little Annie an Annie like
 you
 Pattering over the boards she comes and goes at her
 will
 While Harry is in the fiveacre and Charlie ploughing
 the hill

 XXI
 And Harry and Charlie I hear them toothey sing
 to their team
 Often they come to the door in a pleasant kind of a
 dream
 They come and sit by my chair they hover about my
 bed
 I am not always certain if they be alive or
 dead

 XXII
 And yet I know for a truth theres none of them
 left alive
 For Harry went at sixty your father at sixtyfive
 And Willy my eldest born at nigh threescore and
 ten
 I knew them all as babies and now theyre elderly
 men

 XXIII
 For mine is a time of peace it is not often I
 grieve
 I am oftener sitting at home in my fathers farm
 at eve
 And the neighbors come and laugh and gossip and
 so do I
 I find myself often laughing at things that have long
 gone by

 XXIV
 To be sure the preacher says our sins should make
 us sad
 But mine is a time of peace and there is Grace to
 be had
 And God not man is the Judge of us all when life
 shall cease
 And in this Book little Annie the message is one of
 Peace

 XXV
 And age is a time of peace so it be free from
 pain
 And happy has been my life but I would not live
 it again
 I seem to be tired a little thats all and long for
 rest
 Only at your age Annie I could have wept with the
 best

 XXVI
 So Willy has gone my beauty my eldestborn my
 flower
 But how can I weep for Willy he has but gone for
 an hour
 Gone for a minute my son from this room into the
 next
 I too shall go in a minute What time have I to
 be vext

 XXVII
 And Willys wife has written she never was overwise
 Get me my glasses Annie thank God that I keep
 my eyes
 There is but a trifle left you when I shall have past
 away
 But stay with the old woman now you cannot have
 long to stay

 TITHONUS
 


 The woods decay the woods decay and fall
 The vapors weep their burthen to the ground
 Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath
 And after many a summer dies the swan
 Me only cruel immortality
 Consumes I wither slowly in thine arms
 Here at the quiet limit of the world
 A whitehaird shadow roaming like a dream
 The eversilent spaces of the East
 Farfolded mists and gleaming halls of morn

 Alas for this gray shadow once a man
 So glorious in his beauty and thy choice
 Who madest him thy chosen that he seemd
 To his great heart none other than a God
 I askd thee Give me immortality
 Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile
 Like wealthy men who care not how they give
 But thy strong Hours indignant workd their wills
 And beat me down and marrd and wasted me
 And tho they could not end me left me maimd
 To dwell in presence of immortal youth
 Immortal age beside immortal youth
 And all I was in ashes Can thy love
 Thy beauty make amends tho even now
 Close over us the silver star thy guide
 Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears
 To hear me Let me go take back thy gift
 Why should a man desire in any way
 To vary from the kindly race of men
 Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance
 Where all should pause as is most meet for all

 A soft air fans the cloud apart there comes
 A glimpse of that dark world where I was born
 Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals
 From thy pure brows and from thy shoulders pure
 And bosom beating with a heart renewd
 Thy cheek begins to redden thro the gloom
 Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine
 Ere yet they blind the stars and the wild team
 Which love thee yearning for thy yoke arise
 And shake the darkness from their loosend manes
 And beat the twilight into flakes of fire

 Lo ever thus thou growest beautiful
 In silence then before thine answer given
 Departest and thy tears are on my cheek

 Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears
 And make me tremble lest a saying learnt
 In days faroff on that dark earth be true
 The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts

 Ay me ay me with what another heart
 In days faroff and with what other eyes
 I used to watchif I be he that watchd
 The lucid outline forming round thee saw
 The dim curls kindle into sunny rings
 Changed with thy mystic change and felt my blood
 Glow with the glow that slowly crimsond all
 Thy presence and thy portals while I lay
 Mouth forehead eyelids growing dewywarm
 With kisses balmier than halfopening buds
 Of April and could hear the lips that kissd
 Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet
 Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing
 While Ilion like a mist rose into towers

 Yet hold me not for ever in thine East
 How can my nature longer mix with thine
 Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me cold
 Are all thy lights and cold my wrinkled feet
 Upon thy glimmering thresholds when the steam
 Floats up from those dim fields about the homes
 Of happy men that have the power to die
 And grassy barrows of the happier dead
 Release me and restore me to the ground
 Thou seest all things thou wilt see my grave
 Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn
 I earth in earth forget these empty courts
 And thee returning on thy silver wheels



 THE VOYAGE
 


 I
 We left behind the painted buoy
 That tosses at the harbormouth
 And madly danced our hearts with joy
 As fast we fleeted to the South
 How fresh was every sight and sound
 On open main or winding shore
 We knew the merry world was round
 And we might sail for evermore

 II
 Warm broke the breeze against the brow
 Dry sang the tackle sang the sail
 The Ladyshead upon the prow
 Caught the shrill salt and sheerd the gale
 The broad seas swelld to meet the keel
 And swept behind so quick the run
 We felt the good ship shake and reel
 We seemd to sail into the Sun

 III
 How oft we saw the Sun retire
 And burn the threshold of the night
 Fall from his Oceanlane of fire
 And sleep beneath his pillard light
 How oft the purpleskirted robe
 Of twilight slowly downward drawn
 As thro the slumber of the globe
 Again we dashd into the dawn

 IV
 New stars all night above the brim
 Of waters lightend into view
 They climbd as quickly for the rim
 Changed every moment as we flew
 Far ran the naked moon across
 The houseless oceans heaving field
 Or flying shone the silver boss
 Of her own halos dusky shield

 V
 The peaky islet shifted shapes
 High towns on hills were dimly seen
 We past long lines of Northern capes
 And dewy Northern meadows green
 We came to warmer waves and deep
 Across the boundless east we drove
 Where those long swells of breaker sweep
 The nutmeg rocks and isles clove

 VI
 By peaks that flamed or all in shade
 Gloomd the low coast and quivering brine
 With ashy rains that spreading made
 Fantastic plume or sable pine
 By sands and steaming flats and floods
 Of mighty mouth we scudded fast
 And hills and scarletmingled woods
 Glowd for a moment as we past

 VII
 O hundred shores of happy climes
 How swiftly streamd ye by the bark
 At times the whole sea burnd at times
 With wakes of fire we tore the dark
 At times a carven craft would shoot
 From havens hid in fairy bowers
 With naked limbs and flowers and fruit
 But we nor paused for fruit nor flowers

 VIII
 For one fair Vision ever fled
 Down the waste waters day and night
 And still we followd where she led
 In hope to gain upon her flight
 Her face was evermore unseen
 And fixt upon the far sealine
 But each man murmurd O my Queen
 I follow till I make thee mine

 IX
 And now we lost her now she gleamd
 Like Fancy made of golden air
 Now nearer to the prow she seemd
 Like Virtue firm like Knowledge fair
 Now high on waves that idly burst
 Like Heavenly Hope she crownd the sea
 And now the bloodless point reversed
 She bore the blade of Liberty

 X
 And only one among ushim
 We please nothe was seldom pleased
 He saw not far his eyes were dim
 But ours he swore were all diseased
 A ship of fools he shriekd in spite
 A ship of fools he sneerd and wept
 And overboard one stormy night
 He cast his body and on we swept

 XI
 And never sail of ours was furld
 Nor anchor dropt at eve or morn
 We loved the glories of the world
 But laws of nature were our scorn
 For blasts would rise and rave and cease
 But whence were those that drove the sail
 Across the whirlwinds heart of peace
 And to and thro the countergale

 XII
 Again to colder climes we came
 For still we followd where she led
 Now mate is blind and captain lame
 And half the crew are sick or dead
 But blind or lame or sick or sound
 We follow that which flies before
 We know the merry world is round
 And we may sail for evermore



 IN THE VALLEY OF CAUTERETZ
 


 All along the valley stream that flashest white
 Deepening thy voice with the deepening of the night
 All along the valley where thy waters flow
 I walkd with one I loved two and thirty years ago
 All along the valley while I walkd today
 The two and thirty years were a mist that rolls away
 For all along the valley down thy rocky bed
 Thy living voice to me was as the voice of the dead
 And all along the valley by rock and cave and tree
 The voice of the dead was a living voice to me



 THE FLOWER
 


 Once in a golden hour
 I cast to earth a seed
 Up there came a flower
 The people said a weed

 To and fro they went
 Thro my gardenbower
 And muttering discontent
 Cursed me and my flower

 Then it grew so tall
 It wore a crown of light
 But thieves from oer the wall
 Stole the seed by night

 Sowd it far and wide
 By every town and tower
 Till all the people cried
 Splendid is the flower

 Read my little fable
 He that runs may read
 Most can raise the flowers now
 For all have got the seed

 And some are pretty enough
 And some are poor indeed
 And now again the people
 Call it but a weed



 REQUIESCAT
 


 Fair is her cottage in its place
 Where yon broad water sweetly slowly glides
 It sees itself from thatch to base
 Dream in the sliding tides

 And fairer she but ah how soon to die
 Her quiet dream of life this hour may cease
 Her peaceful being slowly passes by
 To some more perfect peace



 THE SAILOR BOY
 


 He rose at dawn and fired with hope
 Shot oer the seething harborbar
 And reachd the ship and caught the rope
 And whistled to the morning star

 And while he whistled long and loud
 He heard a fierce mermaiden cry
 O boy tho thou art young and proud
 I see the place where thou wilt lie

 The sands and yeasty surges mix
 In caves about the dreary bay
 And on thy ribs the limpet sticks
 And in thy heart the scrawl shall play

 Fool he answerd death is sure
 To those that stay and those that roam
 But I will nevermore endure
 To sit with empty hands at home

 My mother clings about my neck
 My sisters crying stay for shame
 My father raves of death and wreck
 They are all to blame they are all to blame

 God help me save I take my part
 Of danger in the roaring sea
 A devil rises in my heart
 Far worse than any death to me



 THE ISLET
 


 Whither O whither love shall we go
 For a score of sweet little summers or so
 The sweet little wife of the singer said
 On the day that followd the day she was wed
 Whither O whither love shall we go
 And the singer shaking his curly head
 Turnd as he sat and struck the keys
 There at his right with a sudden crash
 Singing and shall it be over the seas
 With a crew that is neither rude nor rash
 But a bevy of Eroses applecheekd
 In a shallop of crystal ivorybeakd
 With a satin sail of a ruby glow
 To a sweet little Eden on earth that I know
 A mountain islet pointed and peakd
 Waves on a diamond shingle dash
 Cataract brooks to the ocean run
 Fairilydelicate palaces shine
 Mixt with myrtle and clad with vine
 And overstreamd and silverystreakd
 With many a rivulet high against the Sun
 The facets of the glorious mountain flash
 Above the valleys of palm and pine

 Thither O thither love let us go

 No no no
 For in all that exquisite isle my dear
 There is but one bird with a musical throat
 And his compass is but of a single note
 That it makes one weary to hear

 Mock me not mock me not love let us go

 No love no
 For the bud ever breaks into bloom on the tree
 And a storm never wakes on the lonely sea
 And a worm is there in the lonely wood
 That pierces the liver and blackens the blood
 And makes it a sorrow to be



 THE RINGLET
 


 Your ringlets your ringlets
 That look so goldengay
 If you will give me one but one
 To kiss it night and day
 Then never chilling touch of Time
 Will turn it silvergray
 And then shall I know it is all true gold
 To flame and sparkle and stream as of old
 Till all the comets in heaven are cold
 And all her stars decay
 Then take it love and put it by
 This cannot change nor yet can I


 2
 My ringlet my ringlet
 That art so goldengay
 Now never chilling touch of Time
 Can turn thee silvergray
 And a lad may wink and a girl may hint
 And a fool may say his say
 For my doubts and fears were all amiss
 And I swear henceforth by this and this
 That a doubt will only come for a kiss
 And a fear to be kissd away
 Then kiss it love and put it by
 If this can change why so can I

 II
 O Ringlet O Ringlet
 I kissd you night and day
 And Ringlet O Ringlet
 You still are goldengay
 But Ringlet O Ringlet
 You should be silvergray
 For what is this which now Im told
 I that took you for true gold
 She that gave yous bought and sold
 Sold sold

 2
 O Ringlet O Ringlet
 She blushd a rosy red
 When Ringlet O Ringlet
 She clipt you from her head
 And Ringlet O Ringlet
 She gave you me and said
 Come kiss it love and put it by
 If this can change why so can I
 O fie you golden nothing fie
 You golden lie

 3
 O Ringlet O Ringlet
 I count you much to blame
 For Ringlet O Ringlet
 You put me much to shame
 So Ringlet O Ringlet
 I doom you to the flame
 For what is this which now I learn
 Has given all my faith a turn
 Burn you glossy heretic burn
 Burn burn



 A WELCOME TO ALEXANDRA
 March 7 1863
 


 Seakings daughter from over the sea
 Alexandra
 Saxon and Norman and Dane are we
 But all of us Danes in our welcome of thee
 Alexandra
 Welcome her thunders of fort and of fleet
 Welcome her thundering cheer of the street
 Welcome her all things youthful and sweet
 Scatter the blossom under her feet
 Break happy land into earlier flowers
 Make music O bird in the newbudded bowers
 Blazon your mottos of blessing and prayer
 Welcome her welcome her all that is ours
 Warble O bugle and trumpet blare
 Flags flutter out upon turrets and towers
 Flames on the windy headland flare
 Utter your jubilee steeple and spire
 Clash ye bells in the merry March air
 Flash ye cities in rivers of fire
 Rush to the roof sudden rocket and higher
 Melt into stars for the lands desire
 Roll and rejoice jubilant voice
 Roll as a groundswell dashd on the strand
 Roar as the sea when he welcomes the land
 And welcome her welcome the lands desire
 The seakings daughter as happy as fair
 Blissful bride of a blissful heir
 Bride of the heir of the kings of the sea
 O joy to the people and joy to the throne
 Come to us love us and make us your own
 For Saxon or Dane or Norman we
 Teuton or Celt or whatever we be
 We are each all Dane in our welcome of thee
 Alexandra



 ODE
 SUNG AT THE OPENING OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION
 


 Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet
 In this wide hall with earths inventions stored
 And praise th invisible universal Lord
 Who lets once more in peace the nations meet
 Where Science Art and Labor have outpourd
 Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet

 O silent father of our Kings to be
 Mournd in this golden hour of jubilee
 For this for all we weep our thanks to thee

 The worldcompelling plan was thine
 And lo the long laborious miles
 Of Palace lo the giant aisles
 Rich in model and design
 Harvesttool and husbandry
 Loom and wheel and enginry
 Secrets of the sullen mine
 Steel and gold and corn and wine
 Fabric rough or Fairy fine
 Sunny tokens of the Line
 Polar marvels and a feast
 Of wonder out of West and East
 And shapes and hues of Part divine
 All of beauty all of use
 That one fair planet can produce
 Brought from under every star
 Blown from over every main
 And mixt as life is mixt with pain
 The works of peace with works of war

 O ye the wise who think the wise who reign
 From growing commerce loose her latest chain
 And let the fair whitewinged peacemaker fly
 To happy havens under all the sky
 And mix the seasons and the golden hours
 Till each man finds his own in all mens good
 And all men work in noble brotherhood
 Breaking their mailed fleets and armed towers
 And ruling by obeying Natures powers
 And gathering all the fruits of peace and crownd with
 all her flowers



 A DEDICATION
 


 Dear near and trueno truer Time himself
 Can prove you tho he make you evermore
 Dearer and nearer as the rapid of life
 Shoots to the falltake this and pray that he
 Who wrote it honoring your sweet faith in him
 May trust himself and spite of praise and scorn
 As one who feels the immeasurable world
 Attain the wise indifference of the wise
 And after Autumn pastif left to pass
 His autumn into seemingleafless days
 Draw toward the long frost and longest night
 Wearing his wisdom lightly like the fruit
 Which in our winter woodland looks a flower

 The fruit of the Spindletree Euonymus Europaeus





 EXPERIMENTS





 BOADICEA
 


 While about the shore of Mona those Neronian legionaries
 Burnt and broke the grove and altar of the Druid and Druidess
 Far in the East Boadicea standing loftily charioted
 Mad and maddening all that heard her in her fierce volubility
 Girt by half the tribes of Britain near the colony Camulodune
 Yelld and shriekd between her daughters oer a wild confederacy

 They that scorn the tribes and call us Britains barbarous populaces
 Did they hear me would they listen did they pity me supplicating
 Shall I heed them in their anguish shall I brook to be supplicated
 Hear Icenian Catieuchlanian hear Coritanian Trinobant
 Must their everravening eagles beak and talon annihilate us
 Tear the noble hear of Britain leave it gorily quivering
 Bark an answer Britains raven bark and blacken innumerable
 Blacken round the Roman carrion make the carcase a skeleton
 Kite and kestrel wolf and wolfkin from the wilderness wallow in it
 Till the face of Bel be brightend Taranis be propitiated
 Lo their colony halfdefended lo their colony Camulodune
 There the horde of Roman robbers mock at a barbarous adversary
 There the hive of Roman liars worship a gluttonous emperoridiot
 Such is Rome and this her deity hear it Spirit of Cassivelaun

 Hear it Gods the Gods have heard it O Icenian O Coritanian
 Doubt not ye the Gods have answerd Catieuchlanian Trinobant
 These have told us all their anger in miraculous utterances
 Thunder a flying fire in heaven a murmur heard aerially
 Phantom sound of blows descending moan of an enemy massacred
 Phantom wail of women and children multitudinous agonies
 Bloodily flowd the Tamesa rolling phantom bodies of horses and men
 Then a phantom colony smoulderd on the refluent estuary
 Lastly yonder yestereven suddenly giddily tottering
 There was one who watchd and told medown their statue of Victory fell
 Lo their precious Roman bantling lo the colony Camulodune
 Shall we teach it a Roman lesson shall we care to be pitiful
 Shall we deal with it as an infant shall we dandle it amorously

 Hear Icenian Catieuchlanian hear Coritanian Trinobant
 While I roved about the forest long and bitterly meditating
 There I heard them in the darkness at the mystical ceremony
 Loosely robed in flying raiment sang the terrible prophetesses
 Fear not isle of blowing woodland isle of silvery parapets
 Tho the Roman eagle shadow thee tho the gathering enemy narrow thee
 Thou shalt wax and he shall dwindle thou shalt be the mighty one yet
 Thine the liberty thine the glory thine the deeds to be celebrated
 Thine the myriadrolling ocean light and shadow illimitable
 Thine the lands of lasting summer manyblossoming Paradises
 Thine the North and thine the South and thine the battlethunder of God
 So they chanted how shall Britain light upon auguries happier
 So they chanted in the darkness and there cometh a victory now

 Hear Icenian Catieuchlanian hear Coritanian Trinobant
 Me the wife of rich Prasutagus me the lover of liberty
 Me they seized and me they tortured me they lashd and humiliated
 Me the sport of ribald Veterans mine of ruffian violators
 See they sit they hide their faces miserable in ignominy
 Wherefore in me burns an anger not by blood to be satiated
 Lo the palaces and the temple lo the colony Camulodune
 There they ruled and thence they wasted all the flourishing territory
 Thither at their will they haled the yellowringleted Britoness
 Bloodily bloodily fall the battleaxe unexhausted inexorable
 Shout Icenian Catieuchlanian shout Coritanian Trinobant
 Till the victim hear within and yearn to hurry precipitously
 Like the leaf in a roaring whirlwind like the smoke in a hurricane whirld
 Lo the colony there they rioted in the city of Cunobeline
 There they drank in cups of emerald there at tables of ebony lay
 Rolling on their purple couches in their tender effeminacy
 There they dwelt and there they rioted theretherethey dwell no more
 Burst the gates and burn the palaces break the works of the statuary
 Take the hoary Roman head and shatter it hold it abominable
 Cut the Roman boy to pieces in his lust and voluptuousness
 Lash the maiden into swooning me they lashd and humiliated
 Chop the breasts from off the mother dash the brains of the little one out
 Up my Britons on my chariot on my chargers trample them under us

 So the Queen Boadicea standing loftily charioted
 Brandishing in her hand a dart and rolling glances lionesslike
 Yelld and shriekd between her daughters in her fierce volubility
 Till her people all around the royal chariot agitated
 Madly dashd the darts together writhing barbarous lineaments
 Made the noise of frosty woodlands when they shiver in January
 Roard as when the rolling breakers boom and blanch on the precipices
 Yelld as when the winds of winter tear an oak on a promontory
 So the silent colony hearing her tumultuous adversaries
 Clash the darts and on the buckler beat with rapid unanimous hand
 Thought on all her evil tyrannies all her pitiless avarice
 Till she felt the heart within her fall and flutter tremulously
 Then her pulses at the clamoring of her enemy fainted away
 Out of evil evil flourishes out of tyranny tyranny buds
 Ran the land with Roman slaughter multitudinous agonies
 Perishd many a maid and matron many a valorous legionary
 Fell the colony city and citadel London Verulam Camulodune



 IN QUANTITY
 


 MILTON

 Alcaics

 O mightymouthd inventor of harmonies
 O skilld to sing of Time or Eternity
 Godgifted organvoice of England
 Milton a name to resound for ages
 Whose Titan angels Gabriel Abdiel
 Starrd from Jehovahs gorgeous armouries
 Tower as the deepdomed empyrean
 Rings to the roar of an angel onset
 Me rather all that bowery loneliness
 The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring
 And bloom profuse and cedar arches
 Charm as a wanderer out in ocean
 Where some refulgent sunset of India
 Streams oer a rich ambrosial ocean isle
 And crimsonhued the stately palmwoods
 Whisper in odorous heights of even


 

 Hendecasyllabics

 O you chorus of indolent reviewers
 Irresponsible indolent reviewers
 Look I come to the test a tiny poem
 All composed in a metre of Catullus
 All in quantity careful of my motion
 Like the skater on ice that hardly bears him
 Lest I fall unawares before the people
 Waking laughter in indolent reviewers
 Should I flounder awhile without a tumble
 Thro this metrification of Catullus
 They should speak to me not without a welcome
 All that chorus of indolent reviewers
 Hard hard hard is it only not to tumble
 So fantastical is the dainty metre
 Wherefore slight me not wholly nor believe me
 Too presumptuous indolent reviewers
 O blatant Magazines regard me rather
 Since I blush to belaud myself a moment
 As some rare little rose a piece of inmost
 Horticultural art or half coquettelike
 Maiden not to be greeted unbenignly



 SPECIMEN OF A TRANSLATION OF THE ILIAD
 IN BLANK VERSE


 So Hector said and sealike roard his host
 Then loosed their sweating horses from the yoke
 And each beside his chariot bound his own
 And oxen from the city and goodly sheep
 In haste they drove and honeyhearted wine
 And bread from out the houses brought and heapd
 Their firewood and the winds from off the plain
 Rolld the rich vapor far into the heaven
 And these all night upon the1 bridge of war
 Sat glorying many a fire before them blazed
 As when in heaven the stars about the moon
 Look beautiful when all the winds are laid
 And every height comes out and jutting peak
 And valley and the immeasurable heavens
 Break open to their highest and all the stars
 Shine and the Shepherd gladdens in his heart
 So many a fire between the ships and stream
 Of Xanthus blazed before the towers of Troy
 A thousand on the plain and close by each
 Sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire
 And champing golden grain the horses stood
 Hard by their chariots waiting for the dawn2
 Iliad VIII 542561


1 Or ridge

2 Or more literally

 And eating hoary grain and pulse the steeds
 Stood by their cars waiting the throned morn
